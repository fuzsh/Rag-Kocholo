We had dated all through high school and college, though he was a graduate of Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. We were fortunate to enjoy many of the pleasant activities at Brown. We have five outstanding children, nine grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. We were blessed with a wonderful life together.”\n\nKen MacLean has moved back to Maryland after 16 years in Palm Springs, Calif.\n\nFrom the September/October 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to class secretary Harold Gadon or directly to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu.\n\nLois Jagolinzer Fain reports: “In planning our traditional annual mini-reunion and as dyed-in-the-wool Pembrokers, our desire was to enjoy our mini-reunion at Brown on the weekend of the 125th Pembroke celebration, which unfortunately could not be scheduled on campus. On April 29, Anne Day Archibald, Virginia Fitzpatrick Bainton, Marcia Cohan Blacher, Dolores Pastore DiPrete, Marilyn Silverman Ehrenhaus, Marjorie Logan Hiles, Janice Howard, Therese Arcand Hughes, and I met at Gregg’s Restaurant in Providence for a delicious meal interlaced with much chatter and laughter. We discussed various ways to keep in touch with all of our classmates and decided that we should continue with snail mail. Thank you to all who financially supported our mail fund.”\n\nLois also writes: “Our idyllic Jupiter, Florida, 20-year residency ended in 2013 when Burt ’47 and I returned to our Rhode Island base. Sadly, Burt passed away on May 31, 2015, three days after we celebrated our 65th wedding anniversary. Burt and I had stayed close to Brown, attending all of our ’47 and ’49 major class reunions. I am now residing in Cranston, Rhode Island, and am enjoying my courses and renewed family connections. I also play Mahjong, hoping it activates the brain. I enjoy the camaraderie of new and old friends. The 36th annual Jagolinzer Memorial Concert, which my sister, Marion Goldsmith '43, and I have sponsored with the Brown music department since 1981, took place at Grant Recital Hall on May 27. It was a proud and joyous occasion for the performers, graduates, their parents, and faculty.”\n\nMarcia Cohan Blacher writes: “My latest enjoyment is playing Mahjong with different groups of pleasant women—it’s a great pastime. I enjoy the newsletter about our classmates and seeing some of them at a class luncheon was really special.”\n\nKathryn Holland Van Buskirk continues to live independently, but the distance keeps her from attending events in Providence. She writes that she treated herself to the purchase of a new car with visual back-up feature.\n\nAnn Kline Cook lives in a retirement community in the North Carolina mountains.\n\nDolores Pastore DiPrete celebrated her 90th birthday on June 14 with her children and grandchildren from Alaska, California, and Nevada. Cousins from Rome and Georgia and friends from Florida and Idaho also attended, as did former neighbors from her birthplace, Cranston, R.I.\n\nMarilyn Silverman Ehrenhaus celebrated a four-generation family reunion last year.\n\nRobert Galkin and his late wife, Wini Blacher Galkin ’52, were both inducted in May into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame, noting among other things Bob’s accomplishments as president of the international company Natco. Bob was also honored earlier that month with an honorary doctorate from the New England Institute of Technology, adding to the honorary doctorate he received from Rhode Island College in 2015. The couple are also Rhode Island Commodores.\n\nJoan Dixon Keller relocated to the Boston area to be near her children. She enjoys her new housing and all the activities available there.\n\nJudith Gellinoff Levy writes: “My last visit to the Brown campus was carrying the banner for our 50th class reunion, but I am delighted that we Pembroke girls are still in touch and visit one another. After retirement from teaching in the Scarsdale (New York) school system and at Marymount Manhattan College, I joined LIRIC (Learning in Retirement at Iona College) in New Rochelle, New York. I attend various classes there twice a week and my favorite is literature. When we discuss Shakespeare I use my Brown textbook with all the notes written in the margins. What a wonderful trip down memory lane.”\n\nJean E. Miller writes: “I had the pleasure of being the one member of the class of 1949 to attend the inspiring 125 Years of Women at Brown conference in May. I found myself being spotted by old friends from various classes, as well as meeting many new friends. What an amazing event. Shortly after returning to Vermont I flew to South Dakota for a mini family reunion in Lennox near Sioux Falls. What a spot. My cousin’s farm (1,500 acres in corn and soybeans) is very successful. I rode various machines, which all seemed to have their own computerized setup. The contrast with New England was remarkable: flat stretches to the horizon and clusters of very old trees sheltering houses and storage barns. Their youngest daughter was graduating from high school with all the bells and whistles deserving of a talented young woman who is off to study aeronautical engineering in the fall.”\n\nJohn T. Townsend retired from Harvard Divinity School and continues to write. His latest work is an article on Rabbinic literature in the Oxford Encyclopedia of the Bible and Ethics. He writes that his Festschrift, entitled “Bridging Between Sister Religions: Studies of Jewish and Christian Scriptures Offered in Honor of Prof. John T, Townsend,” appeared in The Brill Reference Library of Judaism last year. He celebrates the Eucharist each Sunday at Grace Episcopal Church in Newton, Mass.\n\nHenny Wenkart, who is living in New York City, regrets that she was unable to attend the luncheon and writes that her former husband, Henry David Epstein ’46, passed away.\n\nFrom the July/August 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to class secretary Harold Gadon or directly to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu\n\nFrom the May/June 2017 Issue\n\nSend your news to class secretary Harold Gadon or directly to the BAM at alumni_magazine@brown.edu\n\nFrom the March/April 2017 Issue\n\nKen Mac Lean writes: “After 16 years in Palm Springs, California, I have moved back to Maryland, where I am minister emeritus of the Cedar Lane Unitarian Universalist Church in Bethesda. I am in a new life in Gaithersburg.”\n\nFrom the November/December 2016 Issue\n\nMars Bishop (see Allison Lombardo ’05).\n\nFrom the September/October 2016 Issue\n\nClass officers report: “Our 67th reunion was held at the Brown Faculty Club during Memorial Day weekend. Twenty classmates and guests enjoyed a delicious buffet luncheon. Secretary/treasurer Hal Gadon made all of the arrangements. Rev. John Townsend gave the blessing. Tribute was paid to those unable to attend and those who have passed away since our last reunion. Mars Bishop read letters from Bob Alexander, Bob Luce, and Howard Dutemple, who, though unable to attend, sent greetings and shared their thoughts about Brown. All wished a speedy recovery for Ted Low, who was recovering from a broken hip and a heart attack. Class officers Hal Gadon, Bob Galkin, and Sumner Alpert spoke of the warm and friendly feelings prevalent at our reunions, and all hope to be here for the next one.”\n\nDolores Pastore Diprete, Marjorie Hiles, Janice Howard, and Marilyn Silverman Ehrenhaus lunched at the East Side Market as a mini reunion. They write that they attended Chancellor Tisch’s Commencement forum and were again impressed with their alma mater.\n\nMarge Hiles (see Joan McMaster ’60).\n\nJean Miller writes: “In the fall of 2014 I visited cousins in Scotland just after the vote for independence; it was a very interesting time. Last fall I hosted two sets of Scottish friends for Vermont foliage. Family history becomes even more of a commitment, as I am now the matriarch on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2015 I completed an oral history for the Pembroke Center archives. The project was spread over two years of meetings on campus. It’s now digitalized along with quite a number of others, including one by Nan Bailey ’74, who graduated from St. Timothy’s School, where I was formerly headmistress. Last June I went to the 50th reunion of my very first St. Timothy’s School graduating class! I continue my volunteer work on the boards of Maple Street School ( K–8 independent school ) and the Dorset Theatre Festival, and golf when weather permits (I use a cart now), trying to defend my nine-hole championship of 2015. I always enjoy my Pembroke Center Council meetings, which enable me to keep up with the latest on campus.”\n\nPhyllis Burt Morton writes: “Volunteering is my therapy. I am on call to be a surrogate parent for any child in the area; serve on the Citizen Review Board for Lucas County Juvenile Court (I review cases for children involved in the court system due to neglect, abuse, or dependency); coordinate a program for seniors in the area called Christian Seniors Interacting, which offers Bible study, lunch, and a program; serve as a docent and fund-raiser for the Spafford House Museum (established by the Perrysburg Area Historic Museum Inc.); and am an ombudsman for a Toledo inner-city nursing home. I was given a Jefferson Award in 2014 for my volunteer efforts. I pray I can continue these volunteer opportunities forever. I have also been interviewing for Brown admissions—successfully, I might add.”\n\nAdele Goodman Pickar writes: “I live in a wonderful continuing care senior community called Spring Lake Village, and I have an independent living apartment. I participate in many exercise programs and lead a weekly meditation group. I also participate in a Transitions Focus Group, where our committee plans monthly discussion programs for all of us. I am on a bocce team here and also do some hiking with younger friends.”\n\nNorman B. Silk and his wife, Martha, live in Clearwater, Fla. Norman still has his law office in Randolph, Mass. He writes: “I enjoy playing softball on the senior team. It took 88 years to realize I can bat righty and lefty. I still play trombone with both hands.” He is the father of Stephanie Silk Abdo ’80, father-in-law to Rick Abdo ’78, and grandfather of Greg Abdo ’10, and Nicole Abdo ’13.\n\nJohn Townsend retired in 1994 as professor emeritus of New Testament, Judaism, and Biblical Languages from the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass. He taught Jewish studies at the Harvard Divinity School for the next 15 years. He writes: “Even though I no longer teach courses, I still celebrate the 8:00 a.m. Eucharist each Sunday at our local Episcopal Church. In addition, I continue to write. These are titles of a couple of significant essays which I recently wrote and a Festschrift in my honor: ‘Misunderstood New Testament Texts: Mark 2:23 and Galatians 2:1’ in Earliest Christianity; Within the Boundaries of Judaism: Essays in Honor of Bruce Chilton; ‘Rabbinic Literature’ in The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Bible and Ethics; and Festschrift: Bridging Between Sister Religions: Studies in Jewish and Christian Scriptures Offered to Honor Prof. John Townsend.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2016 Issue\n\nSumner Alpert (see Al Gerstein ’54).\n\nFrom the May/June 2016 Issue\n\nJohn T. Townsend retired in 1994 as professor emeritus of New Testament, Judaism, and biblical languages at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass. He then taught Judaic studies at the Harvard Divinity School for 15 years and writes: “Even though I no longer teach, I still celebrate the 8:00 a.m. Eucharist each Sunday at our local Episcopal church. In addition, I continue to write.” This year John published “Misunderstood New Testament Texts: Mark 2:23 and Galatians 2:1” in Earliest Christianity within the Borders of Judaism: Essays in Honor of Bruce Chilton. He also wrote “Rabbinic Literature” for the second volume of the Oxford Encyclopedia of Bible and Ethics, and was honored with a Festschrift titled Bridging Between Sister Religions: Studies in Jewish and Christian Scriptures Offered in Honor of Prof. John Townsend.\n\nFrom the March/April 2016 Issue\n\nSumner Alpert writes: “Another year is slipping by, and I can’t wait to join classmates on the Hill in May. It is sad to see so many of our classmates pass away. This year my daughter, Sandra Sumner Pankiw ’76, will be celebrating her 40th reunion. My special girlfriend, Joyce Rosenthal, has a daughter, Marian Richter ’86, who will be celebrating her 30th reunion. We winter in Sarasota, Florida, for eight months and summer in Newport, Rhode Island, for four. As I approach 90, I look back at how lucky I’ve been, being on dialysis for 17 years and still going strong. As a three-generation Brown alum (my dad was class of ’19), I am proud to have had this long association with Brown. A navy vet from World War II, I belong to a lively war veterans group here in Sarasota and to the Brown Alumni Association, where we even invite other Ivies to our meetings. Hope to see my good friends in May.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2015 Issue\n\nGlenna Robinson Mazel writes: “My grandson, who is 15, is a basketball player, so I’m seeing a lot of games. One granddaughter is in Hawaii volunteering for the Honoka’a Peoples’ Theatre and a coffee farm. Another is returning to Reed College after an internship in New York City to help foreign students who want to attend her school. I have joined a history and current events class given by a UC Berkeley professor. I’m also going to Hawaii with my daughter, as she is representing her firm at a legal conference there. So things are ‘not too shabby,’ as they say.”\n\nHal Gadon writes that he and Mars Bishop, Lloyd Broomhead, Alan Flink, Bob Galkin, Bob Kotlen, Ken Nanian, and Gerrit Sanford enjoyed a luncheon at the Squantum Association in East Providence, R.I . He writes: “Our treasurer, Bob Kotlen, reported that we still have a treasury, and as requested will again plan a ’49 mini-reunion at the 2015 commencement.”\n\nFrom the January/February 2015 Issue\n\nRosalie Adelman Beloff writes that she and her husband, Jerry, “had a wonderful five years [together] in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, before he died in September at 97 years of age. I was sorry to have missed our 65th reunion. However, Lois Fain was nice enough to send the class photo to me. It brought back lots of great memories of Pembroke ’49ers.”\n\nHelen Herlitz writes that she is “alive and well, and living in Irvington, New York, after 61 years of marriage.”\n\nMary Serenna Foxall Day writes: “As a retired children’s librarian, I have seen the positive impact of Lois Lowry’s (’58) writings for children and young people. Loved the article about her and her days at Brown.”\n\nFrom the September/October 2014 Issue\n\nClass secretary Hal Gadon reports: “Our 65th reunion was a resounding success! We were well represented by 23 returning classmates, most of whom were able to march down the hill led by class marshal Gerrit Sanford in full regalia and wearing the top hat of his grandfather, class of 1911. Since we were one of the first reunion classes to march through the Gates, we walked past all the other classes to thunderous applause. It was also very exciting to be part of Brown’s 250th celebration. Our weekend was enhanced by getting together at the nearby Hope Club. Our Brown men and guests (numbering more than 40) were joined by our Pembroke counterparts, and we all enjoyed two special evenings of socializing and fine dining. At our class luncheon meeting led by our president, Mars Bishop, a new slate of officers was elected to serve—we hope—for the next five years: Mars Bishop (president), Alan Flink (first vice president), Lloyd Broomhead (second vice president), Hal Gadon (secretary), and Robert Kotlen (treasurer). Board members elected were: Paul Abramson, Sumner Alpert, Bernard Frechtman, Robert Galkin, Ken Nanian, and Gerrit Sanford. Other classmates attending our 65th were: Don Alden, John M. Barker, Marshall Eisenberg, Burton Fain, Robert Fechtor, Wally Henshaw, Bob Love, Ted Low, Ken Mac Lean, Carl Ostroff, Ronald Pritzker, Morris P. Schwartz, William L. Spillane, and John Townsend.”\n\nPembroke class president Glenna R. Mazel Fortier reports: “We had a great turnout for our reunion; 24 Pembroke classmates brought relatives and guests! Friday evening we met with the Brown men and had cocktails, dinner, and great conversations. Dolores Pastore DiPrete and I then went to Campus Dance and stayed for the a cappella singing on the steps of Sayles Hall at midnight. Saturday we attended various forums and then met for our class meeting and luncheon at the Faculty Club. In the afternoon we went to our classmate Lois Jagolinzer Fain’s annual concert of outstanding Brown musicians. We again joined the Brown men and other classes that preceded us for a really special dinner evening at the Hope Club. Sunday was the culmination and the most spectacular march I have ever seen in my 65 years at Brown. Anne Day Archibald, our reunion chair, accomplished this terrific event via telephone. The human voice proved to be more powerful than the computer. Our class gift was produced by Lois, a CD with songs from our college years. Those in attendance were: Anne Day Archibald, Marcia Cohan Blacher, Vivian Bergquist Clarke, Dolores Pastore DiPrete, Marilyn Silverman Ehrenhaus, Lois Jagolinzer Fain, Margaret Fox Rawls, Marjorie Logan Hiles, Muriel Broadbent Jones, Joan Dixon Keller, Barbara Falconer Lofton, Ellamae Andrews Magee, Glenna Mazel Fortier, Jean E. Miller, Phyllis Burt Morton, Marie Caporale Oddi, Adele Goodman Pickar, Doris Aitken Rolston, Rosalie Brendlinger Smith, Ruth Anderson Turney, Olga Glassman Weiss, Henny Wenkart, and Sally deVeer Whipple. All look forward to another great reunion!”\n\nDolores Pastore DiPrete writes: “Although the years have passed rather quickly since graduation, I still remember that day as clear as a bell. It was a hot, sunny day, and I cringed as I donned my robe. I had a terrible sunburn and the robe seemed to adhere to my flesh. Now, as the years have passed, I still feel very close to Brown. Relationships with classmates have intensified. I look forward to my 69th!”\n\nFrom the March/April 2014 Issue [65th]\n\nAdele Anthony (see John Bauman ’81).\n\nJim Cooney celebrated his 90th birthday in December. He spends the winter in Hutchinson Island, Fla., and enjoys playing bridge and watching sports.\n\nFrom the September/October 2013 Issue\n\nClass officers and committee members have been organizing a mini-reunion event each year, and this year was no exception. A bountiful lunch was provided on campus at the Sigma Chi House. Sixteen classmates and guests from nearby areas enjoyed the friendly get-together. Attendees included class president Mars Bishop, Lloyd Broomhead, Alan Flink, Hal Gadon, Wally Henshaw, Bob Kotlen, Gerrit Sanford, and Norman Silk, who was also celebrating his grandson’s graduation. Paul Abramson, too, has a grandson in the class of 2013, but unfortunately was unable to attend. May 2014 will be a big year for Brown—its 250th Celebration and, for the class of 1949, the 65th reunion. Class officers are planning a dinner in conjunction with the class of ’49 Pembrokers, to be held on Saturday, May 24, 2014. Please save the date. We hope many of you will plan to attend.\n\nClass president Glenna Mazel Fortier reports: “The class of Pembroke ’49 celebrated its annual mini-reunion at the Faculty Club. Attending were Anne Day Archibald, Dolores Pastore DiPrete, Marilyn Silverman Ehrenhaus, Lois Jagolinzer Fain, Rose Jamiel Falugo, Glenna Mazel Fortier, Marjorie Logan Hiles, Jan Howard, Muriel Broadbent Jones, and Jean Miller. We had fun sharing memories of our college days. We also shared e-mails from classmates who were unable to attend, including Alice Agostinho Cardim, from Rio, who attended a Brown Alumni Club organized by Brown and the Catholic Univ. in Rio (PUC). She said she felt like a dinosaur among all the young exchange students, and she wished she could have joined us.”\n\nShirley Whipple Hinds writes that she is busy with the Questers, AAUW, and the Oconomowoc Area Historical Society and Museum. She recently helped plan and set up a replica of the former Strand Theater, where the Wizard of Oz premiered in 1939.\n\nJoan Dixon Keller writes from Atlanta that she is sorry she hasn’t been to recent reunions.

She is still interested in politics and distressed over polarization in our government.

I am finding it both stimulating and relaxing.”\n\nFrom the March/April 2013 Issue\n\nMorris Schwartz writes about the nickel-and-dime poker game he attends every Tuesday afternoon. Usually present are Marshall Eisenberg, Norbert Fessel ’51, and Eugene Weinberg ’51. “Other friends attend as well, all octogenarians. The stakes are low, but the competition is high.”\n\nFrom the September/October 2012 Issue\n\nClass president Glenna Robinson Mazel reports: “The yearly mini-reunion of the Pembroke class of 1949 was held in June.
