        "text": "Letter from the Chair\n\nIt’s been an honor to serve as the Chair of the APS Division of Laser Science. This has been an exciting year for our field! We congratulate the awardees of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics, Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier, for this recognition of their work on the development of methods for attosecond pulse generation. This work builds on many previous advances in our field, and will continue to inspire many more in the future.\n\nThe past year has been an eventful one for DLS, with the return to fully in-person conferences and the resumption of DLS programs that had been suspended during the pandemic. Many thanks are due to our out-going Chair David Reis, the DLS Executive Committee, and our many volunteers for their contributions these efforts. Many thanks also to our newsletter editor, Samir Bali.\n\nThis edition of our newsletter reviews our DLS activities of the past year, including conferences and outreach programs, and notes upcoming DLS activities. We are also pleased to celebrate our recent awardees and APS fellows.\n\nDLS programs would not be possible without the contributions of our members and many volunteers. Please encourage your students and your colleagues in our field to join or to renew their memberships in DLS, and please consider volunteering for our programs. We look forward to seeing you at future DLS conferences and events!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSue Dexheimer\n\nDLS Chair 2022-23\n\nTop\n\nConferences\n\nFrontiers in Optics + Laser Science (FiO LS) Conference 2023\n\nThe Laser Science (LS) Conference held jointly with Optica’s Frontiers in Optics serves as the annual meeting of the Division of Laser Science. Our 2023 conference was held in Tacoma, WA in October. LS Chair David Reis and Co-Chair Sue Dexheimer would like to thank the subcommittee chairs who organized the LS technical symposia:\n\nLS 1: Nanophotonics, Plasmonics, and Metamaterials\n\nChun-Chieh Chang, Los Alamos National Laboratory\n\nLS 2: Quantum Science\n\nNick Vamivakas, University of Rochester\n\nLS 3: Ultrafast Dynamics in Complex Systems\n\nSergio Carbajo, University of California, Los Angeles\n\nLS 4: XFEL and High-field Laser Science\n\nAlexandra Landsman, The Ohio State University\n\nLS 5: Biophotonics and Chemistry Applications\n\nMatthew Graham, Oregon State University\n\nLS also featured three visionary speakers, with presentations:\n\n“Laser Plasma Accelerators: Next Generation X-ray Light Sources”\n\nFélicie Albert, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\n“New Frontiers in the Physics of Nonlinear Multimode Systems and Guided Wave Phenomena”\n\nDemetrios Christodoulides, University of Southern California\n\n“New Scientific Opportunities with Ultrafast X-rays”\n\nMunira Khalil, University of Washington\n\nA highlight of the conference was the LS plenary lecture “Art as Evidence: Uncovering the Past Through the Scientific Analysis of Works of Art” presented by Karen Trentelman of the Getty Conservation Institute.\n\nFinalists for the Carl E. Anderson Division of Laser Science Dissertation Award presented their work in an invited session at the conference, and the finalists and awardee are recognized later in this newsletter. DLS sponsored two additional events associated with the conference, the Undergraduate Research Symposium and the New Laser Scientist Conference, as reported in more detail below.\n\nTop\n\nPrograms\n\nDLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research\n\nThe 23rd DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research was held on Monday, October 9, 2023 in conjunction with the FiO LS conference in Tacoma, WA. There were 46 presentations, all given by students reporting on projects they performed at 33 universities and research institutes. There were a few second authors to some submissions, so the total number of student presenters were 48. Twenty of the presenters were female, an impressive representation of 42%.\n\nLast year’s 22nd DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research, held in conjunction with the FiO LS conference in Rochester, NY on October 17, 2022, was held in person for the first time since 2019. This symposium was similarly successful, with 47 presentations given by 54 students from 45 universities and research institutes, and 33% female representation.\n\nOver the years, the Undergraduate Symposia have brought over 850 students to the annual DLS meeting to present what are often the first research papers of their budding careers. In the past two years, the symposia brought together participants with students participating in a program launched by Optica called “Amplify Optics Immersion”. This program seeks to bring together Black physics and engineering undergraduate or graduate students to explore research and career opportunities within optics and photonics at the FiO LS meeting.\n\nStudent comments included: “The whole experience was great! It was great to be exposed to not only to the cutting edge research of optics and laser science professionally but meeting the students with similar interests was a huge plus.” “As a senior undergraduate student in physics who has, up until now, not had much professional experience in the field, it was an amazing opportunity for me to speak with both accomplished professionals and undergraduate students in my exact same position. It gave me a lot of insight into what my future might hold if I continue down this path and was also comforting in the sense that all of my peers were just as new to it as I was, but that we all shared a passion for our research which is what mattered the most.” “... the greatest benefit for me was to get some practice presenting my work in person in front of an audience of students and professionals close to my particular area of interest. It was also great to get to meet some physicists from industry and academia at the conference in general, and I met some people I'll definitely be contacting in the future about internships or opportunities.”\n\nThe Symposium is supported by DLS, NSF, Optica, AIP, the Society of Physics Students, Thorlabs, East Coast Optical Technologies, Photonics Industries, and students’ home institutions.\n\nThe Undergraduate Research Symposium has been organized for many years by Harold Metcalf, Stony Brook University, and he has been joined by co-organizer Samir Bali, Miami University, since 2019. We congratulate Hal or receiving the 2023 Optica Esther Hoffman Beller Medal for his outstanding mentorship of undergraduate research students and for organizing the Undergraduate Research Symposium at FiO LS.\n\nTop\n\nNew Laser Scientist Conference\n\n2023 saw the resumption of the New Laser Scientist Conference for the first time since 2018. The NLSC, normally held every two years, is a 1½ day mini-conference for new faculty and scientists doing laser related research. The NLSC helps to establish a peer group for new laser scientists and includes roundtable discussions as well as interactions with funding program managers. The conference is designed to benefit new faculty and scientists who are within a few years of their first permanent appointment.\n\nThe 2023 NLSC was held immediately following the FiO LS Conference in Tacoma, WA in October, and included fourteen participants invited from both DLS and DAMOP. The conference program included a panel discussion on career issues led by the conference organizers, presentations on funding by current and former NSF Program Directors Kevin Jones and Christopher Elles, and technical talks by the invitees, followed by a mock panel review session.\n\nThe 2023 NLSC was organized by Dominik Schneble and Susanne Ullrich. We gratefully acknowledge corporate sponsorship by Toptica, Menlo Systems, MKS, Phasetech, and Thorlabs.\n\nTop\n\nDLS Distinguished Traveling Lecturer Program\n\nWe are pleased to resume the long-standing DLS Distinguished Traveling Lecturer Program, which had been paused due to the pandemic. The DTL program was established in 1992 to bring distinguished scientists to predominantly undergraduate colleges and universities to convey the excitement of laser science to undergraduate students. In 2001, the program was expanded to include graduate schools. Priority is given to institutions that are not located in major metropolitan centers and that do not have extensive resources to bring in outside speakers.\n\nDTL lecturers typically visit selected academic institutions for two days, during which time they give a public lecture open to the entire academic community and meet informally with students and faculty. The DTL may also give guest lectures in classes related to laser science. DLS covers travel expenses and pays an honorarium to the speaker, while the host institution takes care of any local expenses.\n\nCurrent Distinguished Traveling Lecturers:\n\nFelicie Albert, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, High Intensity Laser Science\n\nRalph Jimenez, University of Colorado, Chemical and Biophysical Dynamics\n\nAnthony Johnson, University of Maryland, Ultrafast Optical Phenomena\n\nLuis A. Orozco, University of Maryland, Quantum Optics\n\nDavid Reitze, California Institute of Technology, Gravitational Wave Detection\n\nAntoinette Taylor, Los Alamos National Lab, Ultrafast Dynamical Processes\n\nThomas Searles, University of Illinois Chicago, Quantum Engineering\n\nDavid Wineland, University of Oregon and NIST, Quantum Information Science\n\nMengjie Yu, University of Southern California, Nanophotonics\n\nApplications are considered twice each year. The deadline for applications for visits in the Spring 2024 semester is November 30, 2023. For further details and application procedures, please visit the DLS DTL homepage at: https://engage.aps.org/dls/resources/traveling-lecturer\n\nThe DTL program committee is chaired by Rainer Grobe (grobe@ilstu.edu).\n\nTop\n\nStudent Travel Grants and Caregiver and Access Grants\n\nDLS provides partial funding (up to $1000/grant) for travel expenses for a limited number of graduate and undergraduate students to attend and participate in person at CLEO, the APS March meeting, or the Frontiers in Optics + Laser Science Conference. To be eligible, the student must be a member of APS-DLS and must be the presenting author on an accepted oral or poster presentation. The student’s mentor must also be a DLS member. Priority for grants will be given to first-time applicants.\n\nBeginning in 2024, DLS will expand its longstanding Child Care Grant program to more broadly include caregivers (for both children and adults) and disability access. Grants of up to $1,000 are available for DLS members attending any of the three conferences. Proof of an accepted talk or poster is also required. Priority for grants will be given to early career members.\n\nInformation on application procedures and forms are available at:\n\nhttps://engage.aps.org/dls/honors/prizes-awards\n\nThe next deadline for grants will be February 1, 2024 for the APS March Meeting.\n\nTop"
