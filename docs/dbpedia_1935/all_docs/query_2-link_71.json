These individuals are responsible for promoting, overseeing and ultimately nominating students for Goldwater Scholarships.\n\nUse the searchable Campus Representative Locator provided below to identify the Goldwater Campus Representative at a particular academic institution. If your institution does not appear on the Locator, please contact the Goldwater Help Desk at 507-931-8335 or by email at goldwater@scholarshipamerica.org. Contact with the Goldwater Help Desk should also be made if you have tried, unsuccessfully, to contact the named Campus Representative.\n\nClick Here to request an update to the Campus Representative information listed for your institution.\n\nUSING THE LOCATOR\n\nThe Locator can be used in several ways: type the name of the school into the search box found at the upper right-hand corner of the Locator or alphabetize the data by clicking on any of the column headers. (The data in a column can be put in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order using the arrows at the top of the column.) The number of institutions that are displayed can be changed by changing the “Show Entries” number."
