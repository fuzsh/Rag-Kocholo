        "text": "He’d been high tonight, too. I’d seen it in his dilated pupils and manic energy. He never used drugs when we were together, at least not that I knew of, but whatever he was on, it made him swing between bouts of rage and sadness. Despite what he did and things he’d said, I couldn’t help feeling sorry for him. “This time.” Alex’s jaw flexed. “Who knows what might happen the next time you’re alone?” I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could get the words out, images and sounds slammed into my brain, rendering me mute. I threw a stone into the lake and giggled at the ripples that spread over the smooth surface. The lake was my favorite part of our backyard. We had a dock that ran out to the middle of the water, and during the summers, Josh would cannonball off it while Daddy fished and Mommy read magazines and I skipped stones. Josh always teased me about not being able to swim, much less cannonball. I would, though. Mommy signed me up for swimming lessons, and I would be the best swimmer in the world. Better than Josh, who thought he was the best at everything. I’d show him. My mouth turned down at the corners. There would be no more summers by the lakeside with all of us, though. Not since Daddy moved out and took Josh with him. I missed them. It got lonely sometimes, especially since Mommy didn’t play with me like she used to. All she did now was yell into the phone and cry. Sometimes, she sat in the kitchen and just stared into space. It made me sad. I tried to cheer her up—I drew her pictures and even gave her Bethany, my nicest, bestest doll to play with, but it didn’t work. She still cried. Today was a better day, though. It was our first time playing by the lake since Daddy moved out, so maybe it meant she felt better. She’d gone into the house for more sunscreen—she always worried about freckles and stuff like that—but when she got back, I planned to ask her to play with me like we used to. I picked up another stone from the ground. It was smooth and flat, the type that would make really pretty ripples. I drew my arm back to throw it,\n\nbut I smelled something flowery—Mommy’s perfume—that distracted me. My aim veered and the stone thudded onto the ground, but I didn’t mind. Mommy was back! We could play now. I turned, smiling a big gap-toothed smile—my front tooth fell out last week, and I found five dollars from the Tooth Fairy under my pillow after, which was super cool—but I only made it halfway before she pushed me. I pitched forward—down, down, off the edge of the deck, my scream swallowed up by the water rushing toward my face. Reality yanked me back into the present with jarring force. I bent over double, chest heaving, tears streaming down my face. When had I started crying? It didn’t matter. All that mattered was I was crying. Huge, heaving sobs, the kind that made my nose all snotty and my stomach hurt. Thick, salty rivulets ran down my cheeks and dripped off my chin onto the floor. Maybe I’d finally broken, split apart for the world to see. I’d always known I wasn’t normal, me with my forgotten childhood and fragmented nightmares, but I’d been able to hide it behind smiles and laughter. Until now. My nightmares were usually confined to when I was sleeping. They had never consumed me when I was awake. Maybe the adrenaline rush from what happened with Liam triggered something in my brain. If I had to worry about my waking hours and my sleeping ones… I pressed the heels of my palms to my eyes. I was losing it. A cool, strong hand touched my shoulder. I jerked, remembering in a rush that I wasn’t alone. That someone bore witness to my sudden, humiliating breakdown. I also hadn’t noticed that Alex had pulled over to the side of the road until now. If he’d been furious before, he was crazed now. Not in a psycho, angry way—well, maybe a little—but more in a panicked way. His eyes were wild, that muscle in his jaw jumping so fast it had a life of his own. I’d never seen him like that. Pissed, yes. Annoyed, definitely. But not like that. Like he wanted to burn the world down at seeing me hurt. My naïve heart sang, cutting a swath of hope through my lingering panic. Because no one looks at someone like that unless they care, and I realized that I wanted Alex Volkov to care. Very much. I wanted him to care because of me, not because of a promise he’d made\n\nto my brother. Talk about a terrible time to come to such a realization. I was a freaking mess, and he’d just beat the living daylights out of my ex-boyfriend. I sucked in a shaky breath and wiped the tears from my face with the backs of my hands. “I will destroy him.” Alex’s words sliced through the air like lethal blades of ice. Goosebumps blossomed on my skin and I shivered, my teeth chattering from the cold. “Everything he has ever touched, everyone he has ever loved. I will ruin them until they’re nothing more than a pile of ashes at your feet.” I should’ve been terrified by the leashed violence flickering in the car, but I felt oddly safe. I always felt safe around him. “I’m not crying because of Liam.” I took a deep breath. “Let’s not talk or think about him anymore, okay? Let’s salvage the rest of the night. Please.” I needed to take my mind off everything that happened tonight, or I’d scream. A few beats passed before Alex relaxed his shoulders, though his face remained tight. “What do you have in mind?” “Food would be good.” I’d been too nervous to eat at the gala, and I was starving. “Something greasy and bad for you. You’re not one of those health nuts, are you?” His body was so cut he looked like he subsisted on lean protein and green shakes. Disbelief shadowed his eyes before he let out a short laugh. “No, Sunshine, I’m not one of those health nuts.” Ten minutes later, we pulled up in front of a diner that looked like it served nothing but food that was bad for you. Perfect. Heads swiveled in our direction when we walked into the diner. I couldn’t blame them. It isn’t every day you see a duo in black-tie enter a roadside diner. I’d tried my best to fix myself so I was presentable before I left the car, but there’s only so much a girl can do without her makeup bag. Something warm and silky enveloped me, and I realized Alex had taken off his jacket and draped it over my shoulders. “It’s cold,” he said when I shot him a questioning look. He glared at a group of guys who were ogling me—or rather, my breasts—from a nearby table.\n\nI didn’t protest. It was cold, and my gown didn’t cover much. I also didn’t protest when Alex insisted we sit in the back and positioned me in the booth facing the wall, so I was out of the other diners’ sight. We placed our orders, and I shifted beneath the weight of his stare. “Tell me what happened in the car.” For once, his tone was gentle, not commanding. “If not Liam, what made you…” “Freak out?” I fiddled with a loose strand of hair. No one knew about my lost memories or nightmares except my family and closest friends, but I had a strange urge to spill the truth to Alex. “I had a…flashback. Of something that happened when I was young.” I’d been in denial all these years, telling myself they were fictional nightmares instead of fragmented flashbacks, but I couldn’t lie any longer. I swallowed hard before I told Alex, in halting sentences, about my past —or what I remembered of it. It wasn’t the lighthearted conversation I’d envisioned when I’d suggested we “salvage the rest of the night,” but I felt ten times lighter by the time I finished. “They told me it was my mom,” I said. “My parents were going through a nasty divorce, and apparently, my mom had some sort of breakdown and pushed me into the lake, knowing I couldn’t swim. I would’ve drowned had my dad not come by to drop off some papers and seen what happened. He saved me, and my mom’s condition deteriorated further until she killed herself. They told me I was lucky to be alive but…” I drew in a shuddering breath. “Sometimes, I don’t feel lucky.” Alex had listened patiently the entire time, but his eyes flickered dangerously at my last statement. “Don’t say that.” “I know. It’s super self-pitying, which is not what I want. But what you said at the gala earlier? About me craving love? You’re right.” My chin wobbled. Call me crazy, but something about being tucked away this corner of a random diner, sitting across from a man who I thought didn’t even like me until a few hours ago, made me voice my most insidious thoughts. “My mom tried to kill me. My dad barely pays attention to me. Parents are supposed to be the most loving forces in their children’s lives, but…” A tear slipped down my cheek, and my voice broke. “I don’t know what I did wrong. Maybe if I tried harder to be a good daughter—” “Stop.” Alex’s hand curled around mine on the table. “Don’t blame yourself for fucked-up things other people do.” “I try not to, but…” Another shaky breath. “That’s why Liam cheating on\n\nme hurt so much. I wasn’t really in love with him, so I wasn’t heartbroken per se, but he’s yet another person who was supposed to love me but didn’t.” My chest ached. If I wasn’t the problem, why did this keep happening to me? I tried to be a good person. A good daughter, good girlfriend…but no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up hurt. I had Josh and my friends, but there was a difference between platonic love and the deep bonds that bound a person to their parents and significant other. At least, there was supposed to be. “Liam is an idiot and an asshole,” Alex said flatly. “If you let lesser people determine your self-worth, you’ll never reach higher than their limited imagination.” He leaned forward, his expression intense. “You don’t have to work overtime to get people to love you, Ava. Love isn’t earned, it’s given.” My heart rattled in my chest. “I thought you didn’t believe in love.” “Personally? No. But love is like money. Its worth is determined by those who believe in it. And you obviously do.” Such a cynical, Alex way to look at it, but I appreciated his straightforwardness. “Thank you,” I said. “For listening to me and…everything.” He released my hand, and I curled it into a light fist, mourning his warmth. “If you really want to thank me, you’ll take Krav Maga lessons.” Alex arched an eyebrow, and I laughed softly, grateful for the small break. It’d been a heavy night. “Okay, but you have to sit for a portrait with me.” The idea came to me on a whim, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I’d never wanted to photograph someone as much as I wanted to photograph Alex. I wanted to peel back those layers and reveal the fire I knew beat within that cold, beautiful chest. Alex’s nostrils flared. “You’re negotiating with me.” “Yes.” I held my breath, hoping, praying… “Fine. One session.” I couldn’t hold back my smile. I was right. Alex Volkov did have a multilayered heart.\n\n15\n\nAVA I AGONIZED FOR DAYS OVER WHETHER TO SHOOT ALEX IN A STUDIO OR outdoors. I took all of my photoshoots seriously, but this one felt different. More intimate. More…life-changing, like it had the power to make or break me, and not just because I might submit it as part of my portfolio for the WYP fellowship. I would have Alex Volkov all to myself for two hours, and I wouldn’t squander a single second. I eventually chose to shoot him in a studio. I booked the space in the university’s photography building and waited, pulse thumping, for him to arrive. I was more nervous than I should be, but maybe that had something to do with the wildly inappropriate dream I’d had last night. One that featured me, Alex, and positions that would make an acrobat’s jaw drop. Even now, I flushed at the memory. To stave off the onslaught of unbidden, erotic images, I fiddled with my camera and stared outside the window, where hints of fall bloomed on the trees and leaves swirled lazily on soft gusts of wind. Red, yellow, orange— fire on air. A physical marker of the transition from the hot, halcyon days of summer to the icy, bone-chilling beauty of winter. It was September, but a different kind of winter whooshed in on a cloud of delicious spice and cool reserve. Alex entered the room, cutting a sleek, powerful figure in his all-black outfit—black coat, black pants, black shoes, black leather gloves. A sharp contrast to the pale beauty of his face.\n\nMy fingers tightened around my camera. My creative soul salivated, desperate to capture that mystery and lay it bare on the page. I’ve found that the quietest, most reserved people often make the best portrait subjects because the exercise doesn’t require them to speak; it requires them to feel. Those who bottle up their emotions every day feel the strongest and love the hardest; the best photographers are the ones who can capture each drop of emotion as it spills out and mold it into something visceral, relatable. Universal. Alex and I didn’t greet each other. No words, not so much as a nod. Instead, the air hummed with silence as he divested himself of his coat and gloves. It wasn’t overtly sexual, but everything about the man was sexual. The way his strong, deft fingers slid each button from its hole without so much as a pause or stumble; the way his shoulders and arms flexed beneath his shirt as he hung his coat on the hook by the door; the way he moved toward me like a panther stalking its prey, his eyes bright with scorching intensity. The velvety tips of butterfly wings brushed my heart, and I clutched my camera tighter, willing myself not to step back or tremble. Liquid warmth pooled in my stomach, and every inch of my body became a nerve ending, hypersensitized and throbbing with arousal. He hadn’t touched me, and I was already so turned on I trembled. I hadn’t thought that was possible outside romance novels and movies. Those green eyes flared, like he knew exactly what he did to me. How tight my nipples were beneath my thick sweater, how wet I was between my thighs. How much I wanted to devour him, to pour myself into the cracks of his soul so he would never be alone. “Where do you want me?” Gravel rasped his voice for the first time since I’d met him, turning the clear, authoritative tone into something darker. More sinful. Where did I want him? Everywhere. Over me. Beneath me. Inside me. I licked my suddenly dry lips. Alex’s gaze dropped to my mouth, and my entire body pulsed. No. I wasn’t a schoolgirl on a date. I was a professional. This was professional. A portrait session with a subject, just like countless other sessions I’d had in the past. Of course, I hadn’t wanted to throw any of my previous subjects on the\n\nfloor and ride them until kingdom come, but that was a minor detail. “Uh, here is fine,” I croaked, gesturing to the stool I’d set up on a plain white background. I’d kept today’s set up simple. I didn’t want anything to detract from Alex, not that they could. His presence obliterated everything around him until he was the only thing left standing. He folded himself gracefully on the stool while I checked my settings and snapped a few test shots. Even unposed, his photos jumped off the screen, his gorgeous features and piercing eyes tailor-made for the camera. I reigned in my shameless lust and spent the next hour coaxing him out of his shell, moving him into various poses, and encouraging him to relax. I wasn’t sure Alex understood the meaning of the word. The pictures so far were beautiful, but they lacked emotion. Without emotion, a beautiful photo is just a photo. I attempted to open him up with chitchat, talking to him about everything from the weather to Josh’s latest update to that day’s news, but he remained aloof and guarded. I tried a different tactic. “Tell me about your happiest memory.” Alex’s lips thinned. “I thought this was a photoshoot, not a therapy session.” “If it were a therapy session, I’d be charging you five hundred dollars an hour,” I quipped. “You have an inflated sense of your worth as a therapist.” “If you can’t afford me, just say so.” I snapped more pictures. Finally. A sign of life. The click and whir of the shutter filled the air. “Sweetheart, I could get you with a snap of my fingers, and I wouldn’t have to shell out a single penny.” I lowered my camera and glared at him. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?” A tiny smirk tugged at the corner of Alex’s mouth. “It means you want me. You wear your emotions all over your face.” My thighs clenched, and my skin burned until I thought I’d collapse into a pile of ashes on the ground. “Now who’s the one with an inflated sense of self-worth?” I managed, my heart racing. Alex had never said anything so direct to me before. He usually shut down any hint of attraction between us, but here he was, talking\n\nabout me wanting him. He was right, but still. Alex leaned forward and clasped his hands loosely together. Graceful, casual but alert. Waiting to lure me into his trap. “Tell me it’s not true.” I licked my lips again, my throat parched, and his gaze zeroed in on my mouth. The small but unmistakable movement bolstered my confidence and compelled me to say something I would’ve never had the guts to say otherwise. “It’s true.” I almost smiled at the flare of surprise in his eyes. He hadn’t expected honesty. “But you want me too. Question is, are you too scared to admit it?” Alex’s thick, dark brows lowered. “I’m not scared of anything.” Lies. I would’ve believed him a month ago, but now I knew better. Everyone fears something; it’s what makes us human. And Alex Volkov—for all his control, all his power—was still wonderfully, frighteningly, heartbreakingly human. “That doesn’t answer my question.” I walked over to him, my camera swaying from the strap looped around my neck. He didn’t move an inch, not even when I brushed my fingers along his jaw. “Admit you want me, too.” I wasn’t sure where my boldness came from. I wasn’t Jules. I always waited for the guy to ask me out—partly out of fear of rejection, partly because I was too shy to make the first move. But I had a feeling if I waited for Alex, I might have to wait forever. It was time to take matters into my own hands “If I wanted you, I would’ve taken you already,” Alex said with lethal softness. “Unless you’re too scared.” I was playing with fire, but that was better than standing out in the cold alone. I stiffened when Alex trailed his fingers down my neck and over my shoulder. His lips curved into a smirk. “Nervous? I thought this was what you wanted,” he taunted. His hand dipped lower, closer to the curve of my breast. The ice pools in his eyes melted, revealing a blazing inferno that heated me from head to toe. My head spun. My nipples tightened into firm beads, and my pulse throbbed through every inch of my body. Somehow, it was worse that he wasn’t touching me where I ached most; the anticipation heightened my\n\nsenses, and my skin tingled with phantom caresses. “That’s not what I said,” I wheezed. Oh God, this was embarrassing. What had I been thinking? I wasn’t a femme fatale or a…a…whatever else was like a femme fatale. I couldn’t think straight. Alex grazed his thumb over my breast, and I moaned. Moaned. From a touch that lasted less than two seconds. I wanted to die. His pupils dilated until the green irises were eclipses ringed with jade fire. He dropped his hand, and cool air rushed in to replace the warmth of his touch. “Finish the photoshoot, Ava.” The roughness of his voice scraped against my skin. “What?” I was too shocked by the sudden change in the atmosphere to process his words. “The photoshoot. Finish it,” he gritted out. “Unless you want to start something you’re not ready to finish.” “I—” The photoshoot. Right. I backed away on unsteady legs and tried to refocus on the task at hand. Alex sat straight-backed, his face hard, while I circled him and captured every angle I could think of. The low hum of the heater was the only sound breaking the silence. “Okay. We’re done,” I said after twenty minutes of excruciating quiet. “Thanks—” Alex stood, grabbed his coat, and walked out without another word. “For doing this,” I finished, my words echoing in the empty room. I exhaled a long-held breath. Alex was the most mercurial person I knew. One minute, he was gentle and protective; the next, he was closed-off and distant. I scrolled through the photos, curious as to how they’d turned out. Oh. Wow. Alex’s emotions leaped off the screen after our…interaction, and yes, most of it was irritation, but irritation on him looked better than contentment on anyone else. The way the shadows hit the sharp lines of his brows, the glare of his eyes, the set of his jaw…these were possibly the best photos I’d ever taken. I paused at one of the last shots, and my heart stuttered to a stop. I’d been so busy snapping away I hadn’t paid attention in the moment,\n\nbut now I saw it clear as day. Stark desire scrawled across Alex’s face as he stared at me, his eyes burning through the camera and straight into my soul. It was the only photo where he wore that expression, so it must’ve been a momentary slip on his part. A stripping of his mask, if only for a few seconds. But here’s the thing: even a few seconds can change someone’s life. And as I turned off the camera and packed up my equipment with shaky hands, I couldn’t shake the feeling that mine had been altered forever.\n\n16\n\nALEX “IT’LL BE OVER IN A FEW MONTHS.” I LEANED BACK IN MY CHAIR AND ROLLED my whiskey glass in my hands, watching dust mites dance in the air before me. “Hmmm.” My uncle rubbed his jaw, his eyes sharp as he examined me through the screen. I’d turned the guest room into my home office, as I preferred to work from home on the days I didn’t have to be in the office. Fewer tiresome interactions that way. “You don’t seem excited for someone who’s been working toward this since you were ten.” “Excitement is overrated. All I care about is that it’ll be done.” Despite my words, my chest pinched, because my uncle was right. I should feel excited. Vengeance was so close I could taste it, but instead of sweet relief, it coated my tongue with bitterness and turned my stomach sour. What came after vengeance? Every other purpose I could have paled in comparison to the force that had driven me all these years. It’d held me together while I shattered on the inside. It’d revived me as I lay bleeding, comatose in a pool of guilt and horror. It’d created the chessboard on which I’d painstakingly lined up all the pieces one by one, year over year until the moment came for me to topple the king. I didn’t fear much, but I feared what would happen after I lost my purpose. “Speaking of done…” I set my glass on the table. “I assume you signed the papers for the Gruppmann deal today.” Ivan smiled. “Congratulations. You’re one step closer to world domination.”\n\nMe. Because Archer Group had always been mine. I’d funded its inception with my money, and the company had flourished under my guidance over the years. My father had started his own successful construction company after immigrating to the U.S., and it’d been his dream to see me take it over one day. The company had collapsed in the wake of his death—I’d been too young to prevent its demise—but I’d built upon his legacy and created something new. Something bigger. All my parents had wanted was for me to grow up happy and successful. While the “happy” part may be a reach, I could damn well work on the “successful” part. After my uncle and I wrapped up our weekly check-in, I opened my burner laptop and pulled up the encrypted folder where I kept all the documents detailing my enemy’s finances, business dealings—both legal and illegal—and upcoming contracts. I’d chipped away at his empire over the years, slow enough that he thought he was just going through a long string of shitty luck. Now I needed just one more piece of evidence before I felled him for good. I stared at the screen, the numbers blurring before my eyes as I envisioned my endgame. The prospect didn’t excite me as much as it used to. At least I’d taken satisfaction in the fall of Liam Brooks. A few wellplaced calls, and he’d been fired and blacklisted from every company that mattered in the northeastern United States. A few whispers in the right ears, and he’d landed on D.C. society’s blacklist. Honestly, I’d just sped up his inevitable fall from grace—according to the information my people dug up, Liam had picked up a nasty drug habit and several DUIs since graduating. It was only a matter of time before he fucked up at his job or pissed off the wrong people on his own. He was a man who’d had everything handed to him on a silver platter, and he threw it away for a temporary high. Excuse me while I cry a nonexistent river. Then again, he’d cheated on Ava, so he clearly lacked the good-judgment gene. My phone pinged with a social media notification. I despised social media, but it was the world’s biggest goldmine of information. It was amazing how much personal information people shared online with little to no regard for who might be watching. I tapped on the notification so it would go away and accidentally clicked\n\ninto the app, where a shaky video of two people arguing auto-played. I was about to exit when I paused. Looked closer. Fuck! The video was still playing when I left and sped toward Madeline’s house.\n\n17\n\nAVA OF ALL THE WAYS I’D PICTURED MY FRIDAY NIGHT GOING, GETTING TRAPPED in a pool room by a blonde who eyed me like I’d stolen her favorite Prada purse wasn’t one of them. “I’m sorry, do I know you?” I strove for politeness even as I took a step back. The woman looked familiar, but I couldn’t place where I’d seen her before. “I don’t believe we’ve met.” Her smile could’ve cut glass. Objectively, she was one of the most beautiful women I’d ever met. With her spun-gold hair, cerulean eyes, and statuesque body, she was what I imagined Aphrodite would look like had she been a real person. But there was something hard about her expression that made her not attractive at all. “Madeline Hauss of the petrochemical Hausses. This is my house.” “Oh. I’m Ava. Chen,” I added when she continued staring at me. “Of the, uh, Maryland Chens. Can I…help you?” I hoped that didn’t come off rude, considering this was her house, but I hadn’t wanted to attend this party in the first place. Stella, who was friends with what must be Madeline’s sister, had persuaded me to go out after I spent the past few days buried in school, work, and my fellowship application. Jules and Bridget were both busy tonight, so it was only the two of us. “I wanted a good look at you,” Madeline purred. “Since you captured so much of Alex’s attention during the gala.” The gala. Of course. This was the woman I’d seen Alex talking to while I danced with Colton. I’d tried not to look, but I couldn’t help staring and comparing myself to her the whole time. To Jules’s dismay, I’d nixed the jealousy part of Operation Emotion, but\n\nI’d admittedly used Colton to make Alex jealous at the gala. It was stupid and petty, but Colton had shown up around the same time I saw Alex with Madeline, and I’d been so consumed with jealousy myself I went for it. Judging by Alex’s reaction when he saw us dancing, it had worked—a little too well, judging by Madeline’s glare. “I didn’t realize you knew Alex,” I fibbed. My stomach churned, and not because of Madeline’s poisonous tone. The Hausses’ pool room looked like a luxurious, modern Roman bath, all white marble and gilded columns. The pool itself gleamed turquoise beneath a glass dome that revealed the night sky in all its glory, and I spotted the colorful swirl of mosaics beneath the water forming the shape of a mermaid. But the smell of chlorine and sight of all that water… My dinner rose in my throat. The Hausses lived in a giant house in Bethesda, and Stella and I had spent the night room hopping, enjoying the different music and entertainment options in each space. While Stella left to find us fresh drinks, I’d wandered into the room next to the one we’d been in and found myself facing my worst, watery nightmare. Madeline had cornered me before I could leave, and here we were. “Oh, I know Alex very well,” Madeline said, and I knew, with a sickening drop in my stomach, that she was one of the “certain women” he’d been involved with. Were they still involved? Was she the one he’d almost gone on a date with before I ambushed him for movie night? Jealousy gnawed at me, almost overpowering my nausea from the chlorine. “What I don’t get is why he would be interested in you.” She flicked her gaze over me. “I doubt you can keep up with his tastes in the bedroom.” Despite myself, curiosity reared its ugly head. What tastes? “You’d be surprised,” I bluffed, hoping she’d reveal more information. My mind flashed back to my sex dream starring Alex, and my heart raced. Madeline smirked. “Please. You look like the type who expects tender kisses and sweet nothings in bed. But as you probably know—” Her smirk turned vicious. “Alex doesn’t do either of those things. It’s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.’s female population. No kissing, no faceto-face contact during sex.” She lowered her head so she could whisper in my ear. “But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars.\n\nCall you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.” She straightened, her eyes gleaming with triumph at my scarlet face. “Some women like that. You…” She looked me over again with a laugh. “Go back to your bake sales, honey. You’re way out of your league.” My body throbbed at her words, both out of anger at her condescension and stunning arousal at the picture she’d painted. We were attracting attention. Other partygoers gathered around us, hungry for drama. A few even had their phones out, recording. I guessed Madeline was the draw, because I wasn’t well-known enough to be that interesting. “Maybe,” I said, matching the blonde’s honey-laced poison. “He just doesn’t like looking at you during sex. Because he’s never had that problem with me.” Lies. But she didn’t need to know that. I kept my head above the fray best I can, but I could play dirty when the situation called for it. Madeline’s smile disappeared. “He’ll be sick of you in a week. There’s only so much sugar a man like Alex can take before he gets a stomachache.” “And there’s only so much bitterness he can take before he kicks it to the curb.” I raised my eyebrows. “But you already know that, don’t you?” I wasn’t sure where my sass came from, since I wasn’t a sassy person, but Madeline brought out all my claws. I hated being the type of girl who fought with other girls over a guy, but she’d attacked me first. I wouldn’t stand here and let her walk all over me. Madeline’s creamy skin flushed with anger. “Are you calling me bitter?” Walk away, my better angels encouraged me. I almost did, until I pictured Madeline and Alex together, and the words fell out of my mouth. “Yes, and? What are you going to do about it?” Childish. So freakin’ childish. But the taunt was out there, and I couldn’t — My mind blanked when my body pitched backward and hit the pool with a splash. She’d pushed me. Into the pool. The pool. Ohgodohgodohgod. Grotesque, echoing laughter broke out, but it sounded dim compared to the roaring in my ears. Shock and panic suffused me, freezing my limbs, and\n\nall I could do was stare at Madeline’s twisted smirk until my face sank beneath the water. I’m going to die.\n\n18\n\nALEX “WHERE IS SHE?” I GRASPED MADELINE BY THE THROAT, RESISTING THE URGE to squeeze until I wiped the smug look off her face. I’d never raised a hand to a woman outside the bedroom—and then only if they consented—but I was this close to losing my shit. After I saw the video of Madeline pushing Ava into the pool, which I recognized from my previous visits to the Hauss mansion, I broke every speed limit to get here. By the time I arrived, the party had ended and only a few stragglers remained. I found Madeline laughing with her cronies in the kitchen, but it had only taken a glare from me for her to excuse herself and follow me into the hall. “Why don’t you tighten your hold a little?” she purred. “You know you want to.” “I’m not here to play games.” I was holding onto my patience by a thread. “Answer my question, or Hauss Industries is over.” “You don’t have that kind of power.” “Don’t underestimate me, sweetheart.” It wasn’t an endearment. “Just because we’ve fucked a few times doesn’t mean you know what—or who—I have in my back pocket. So unless you want to explain to dear old Dad why regulators are breathing down his neck and his precious company stock is tanking, I suggest you answer me. Now.” Madeline’s lips compressed into a thin line. “Her friend pulled her out of the pool, and they left,” she said, sullen. “How was I supposed to know she can’t swim?” My grip tightened, and my lips curled into a sneer when I saw the resulting flare of desire in her eyes. “Pray she’s all right, or the downfall of\n\nHauss Industries will be the least of your worries,” I said softly. “Do not contact or come near her or me again. Understand?” Madeline lifted her chin in defiance. “Do. You. Understand.” I pressed my thumb into the soft flesh of her neck—not enough to injure, but enough to make her flinch. “Yes,” she choked out, resentment coating her voice. “Good.” I released her and walked away, keeping my steps calm when all I wanted was to race to Ava’s house and check if she was okay. She hadn’t answered any of my calls and texts, and while I understood why, it still made me nervous. “Is she really worth it?” Madeline called after me. I didn’t bother answering her. Yes. When I reached my car, I floored the gas and nearly mowed over a group of drunk frat boys. My grip strangled the steering wheel as I imagined how Ava must have felt when she fell into the pool—or how she must feel right now. A mixture of worry and anger coiled in my stomach. Fuck what I told Madeline earlier. She’d put a huge target on her family’s back, and I wouldn’t rest until Hauss Industries was no more than a footnote in corporate history. I pulled up to Ava’s house in time to see Stella exiting. I cut the engine and made it to the front door in half a dozen long strides. “How is she?” I demanded. Worry etched itself on Stella’s face. “She could be worse, given the circumstances. I was getting us drinks when she went into the pool room…” She gnawed on her bottom lip. “Anyway, I found her when that woman pushed her into the pool. I got her out before she passed out or anything like that, but she’s pretty shaken. Jules isn’t home yet, and I wanted to stay with her, but she said she’s going to sleep and insisted I leave.” Stella’s brows knit together. “You should check on her. Just in case.” That was a big ask coming from Stella, who liked me the least out of Ava’s friends, and it said a lot about Ava’s current state. “I’ll take it from here.” I brushed past her into the living room. “How did you find out what happened so fast?” Stella called after me. “Online,” was all I said. I made a mental note to call my tech guy and have him scrub every trace of the video off the internet. He was the same\n\nperson I relied on to hack into my competitors’ computers and dig up offshore accounts. Five years of working together, and there hadn’t been a single leak or job he couldn’t complete. In return, I’d paid him enough money over the years that he could buy a private island off the coast of Fiji if he wanted. I took the stairs two at a time until I reached Ava’s room. The light spilling through the crack in the door told me she was still awake, despite what she’d told Stella. I rapped my knuckle twice against the wood. “It’s Alex.” There was a short pause. “Come in.” Ava sat in bed, her hair damp and her gaze wary as she took me in. Worry edged out my anger when I saw how pale her cheeks were and the way she shivered, even though the heat was on and she’d tucked herself beneath a thick comforter. “I saw what happened. Some fucker filmed it live on social.” I sat on the edge of the bed and resisted the insane urge to tuck her into my chest. “I’m sorry.” “It’s not your fault. Don’t blame yourself for fucked-up things other people do.” A smile ghosted my mouth as she threw my words back at me. “You have terrible taste in women though.” Ava sniffled. “Do better.” “Madeline and I are over. We never even started.” “That’s not what she told me.” I cocked my head at her stiff tone. “Are you…jealous?” The thought pleased me more than it should’ve. “No.” With her scowl and fluffy gray top, she looked like an angry kitten. “As if. So what if she’s tall and blonde and looks like a Victoria’s Secret model? She’s a horrible person. Next time I see her, I’m going Krav Maga on her ass.” I bit back a full smile. Ava had attended all of one lesson. It’d be a while before she went anything on anyone’s ass, but her indignation was adorable. “She won’t be bothering you again.” I grew serious. “The pool—” “I thought I was going to die.” I flinched, horror skating through me at the thought. “I thought I was going to die because I can’t swim and I have this stupid phobia and I am so sick of it.” Ava fisted her covers, her mouth tight. “I hate feeling helpless and out of control in my own life. Do you know one of my\n\nbiggest dreams is to travel the world and I can’t even do that because the idea of flying over an ocean makes me sick?” She took a deep, shaky breath. “I want to see what’s out there. The Eiffel Tower, the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China. I want to meet new people and try new things and live life, but I can’t. I’m trapped. When I was in that pool, thinking those were my last moments…I realized I’ve done none of the things I want to do. If I died tomorrow, I’d die with a lifetime of regrets, and that terrified me even more than the water.” She looked up at me, her big brown eyes wide and vulnerable. “That’s why I need you to do something for me.” This time, I was the one who swallowed hard. “What is it, Sunshine?” “I need you to teach me to swim.”\n\n19\n\nAVA IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE ALEX VOLKOV, A LITANY OF WORDS CAME TO MIND. Cold. Beautiful. Ruthless. Genius. “Patient” wasn’t one of them. It wasn’t even in the top thousand. But over the past few weeks, I had to admit I might have to bump it up on the list, because he’d been nothing but patient as he guided me through a series of visualization and meditation exercises to prepare me for my first real swimming session. If you’d told me two months ago that I would be “visualizing” and “meditating” with Alex freakin’ Volkov, I would’ve laughed my ass off, but sometimes reality is stranger than fiction. And you know what? The exercises helped. I’d visualize myself standing near a body of water, then use deep breathing and relaxation techniques to calm myself. I started small, with pools and ponds, and worked my way up to lakes. Alex also started taking me to bodies of water so I could get more comfortable near them. I even dipped my toe into a pool. I wasn’t cured of my fear of water, but I could think about it now without having a panic attack—most of the time. The thought of flying over an ocean still made me sick to my stomach, but we’d get there. The most important thing was, I had hope. If I worked long and hard enough, then maybe one day, I would finally conquer the fear that had haunted me for as long as I could remember. But that wasn’t the only seismic change in my life. Something had shifted in my relationship with Alex. He was no longer just my brother’s best friend, but my friend too, though some of the thoughts I had toward him were less than platonic. What I’d felt during our photoshoot was nothing compared to\n\nthe fantasies running through my mind now. He will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut. That was the one snippet from my horrible conversation with Madeline I couldn’t forget. Every time I thought about it, my thighs clenched and warmth flooded my lower belly. I was also ashamed to admit that yes, I’d masturbated to fantasies of Alex doing…those things to me more than once. Not that he would. He’d been frustratingly composed since my pool incident—no heated gazes, no lingering touches, no trace of the desire I’d seen on his face in that photo from our shoot. I hoped that would change tonight. “I’m nervous.” Stella crouched behind the couch; she was so tall she had to bend all the way so her dark curls didn’t peek out from the top. “Are you nervous?” “No,” I lied. I was definitely nervous. It was Alex’s birthday, and I was throwing him a surprise party. There was every chance he hated both surprises and parties, but I felt compelled to do something for him. Besides, no one should be alone on their birthday. I’d asked Alex what his plans for tonight were—not letting on that I remembered it was his birthday—and he said he had business documents to look over. Business documents. On his birthday. I don’t think so. Since I didn’t know any of his friends except Ralph, our Krav Maga instructor, I’d kept the guest list small. Jules, Stella, Bridget, Booth, and a few other students from the KM Academy hid in Ralph’s living room. Ralph had agreed to host the shindig and trick Alex into thinking it was a casual Halloween get-together for academy regulars; he and Alex should arrive any minute now. I’d nixed the costume party idea—Alex didn’t strike me as a costume sort of guy—but I hoped the party itself was a good idea. Most people liked parties, but he wasn’t most people. A car door slammed, and my stomach tightened with anticipation. “Shh! They’re here,” I said in a loud whisper. The lingering murmurs in the dark room quieted. “…help me set up,” Ralph said, opening the door and flipping on the light. We all jumped out. “Surprise!”\n\nI wish I’d had my camera ready, because the expression on Alex’s face? Priceless. He looked like a frozen mannequin except for his eyes, which moved from the balloons I’d tied to various pieces of furniture to the handmade poster spelling out Happy birthday, Alex! in glittery blue cursive before resting on my face. “Happy birthday!” I chirped, trying to tamp down my nerves. I couldn’t tell if he liked or hated the surprise, or if he was indifferent. The man was harder to read than a Latin textbook in the dark. No response. Alex remained frozen. Jules came to the rescue, turning on the music and encouraging people to eat and mingle. While the rest of the party scattered, I edged my way toward him and pasted on a bright smile. “Fooled you, huh?” “How did you know it’s my birthday?” Alex peeled off his jacket and tossed it over the back of the couch. At least that meant he was staying. I shrugged, feeling self-conscious. “You’re Josh’s best friend. Of course I know.” He frowned. “You’ve never celebrated my birthday before.” “There’s a first time for everything. C’mon.” I pulled at his wrist. “You’re twenty-seven! That means you have to take twenty-seven shots.” His frown deepened. “Absolutely not.” “It was worth a try.” I grinned. “Just wanted to see if you were dumb enough to do it.” “Ava, I’m a genius.” “A humble one too.” Alex cracked a smile. Not a big one, but we were getting there. It took some effort, but he eventually relaxed more and more throughout the night until he was eating and chatting with people like a normal human. I’d baked him a red velvet cake since he liked red velvet, and we sang “Happy Birthday” while he blew out the candles. All normal stuff. He did, however, refuse to participate when a half-drunk Ralph broke out his karaoke machine. “Come on!” I insisted. “You don’t have to be a good singer. I’m terrible, but I do it anyway. It’s all in good fun.” Alex shook his head. “I don’t do anything unless I’m good at it, but don’t let me stop you.” “That’s silly. How can you be good at something unless you practice?”\n\nHe still wouldn’t budge, so I sighed and serenaded the party with an offkey solo rendition of Britney Spears’ “Oops I Did It Again” while they cheered me on. Alex lounged on the couch, one arm draped over the back, top few buttons of his shirt unbuttoned. A lazy smile graced his face as he watched me sing my heart out. He looked so gorgeous and at ease I stumbled over the lyrics, but everyone gave me a standing ovation anyway. The party wrapped up a few hours later, and I insisted on staying and cleaning up even after Ralph told me he’d take care of it. Everyone offered to pitch in as well, so we split into different groups—garbage duty, sweeping duty, etcetera. Alex and I somehow ended up on dish duty together. Ralph didn’t have a dishwasher, so I hand-washed while he dried. “I hope you had a good time,” I said, scrubbing caked-on sugar from a plate. “Sorry if we gave you a heart attack.” His chuckle sent the butterflies in my stomach into a tizzy. “It would take more than a surprise party to give me a heart attack.” He took the plate from me and wiped it dry before setting it on the dish rack. Seeing Alex do something as domestic as dishes sent another flutter through my system. I have serious issues. “I had a good time though.” He cleared his throat, his cheeks coloring. “This was my first birthday party since my parents died.” I froze. Alex had never brought up his parents before, but I knew from Josh they’d died when he was young, which meant he hadn’t had a birthday party in at least a decade. My heart ached for him. Not because of the party, but because he could no longer celebrate with his family. For the first time, I realized how lonely Alex must be with no relatives left in the world except for his uncle. “So what do you usually do on your birthday?” I asked in a soft voice. He shrugged. “Work. Grab a drink with Josh. It’s not a big deal. My parents made it a big deal, but after their death, it seemed pointless.” “How did—” I stopped myself before I finished the question. A guy’s birthday was not the right time to bring up the method of his family’s death. Alex answered anyway. “They were murdered.” After a beat of hesitation, he added, “My father’s business rival ordered the hit and made it look like a home invasion gone wrong. My parents hid me right before the intruders found us, but I saw…” His throat bobbed with a hard swallow. “I saw it happen. My mom, dad, and little sister, who didn’t hide in time.”\n\nHorror suffused me at the thought of someone having to witness their own family’s murder. “I’m so sorry. That’s—I have no words.” “It’s all right. At least they caught the bastards who pulled the trigger.” “And the business rival?” I asked softly. His eye twitched. “Karma will get him.” My heart weighed heavy in my chest even before something more horrifying occurred to me. “Your HSAM—” Alex flashed a humorless smile. “Is a real bitch. I relive that day every day. Sometimes I think about whether I could’ve saved them, even though I was just a kid. I used to rage at the unfairness of it all until I realized no one gives a shit. There’s no entity out there listening to me yell at them. There’s only life and luck, and sometimes both those things deal you a crap hand.” Tears stung my eyes. I’d forgotten all about the dishes; my heart hurt too much. I stepped closer to Alex, who watched me approach with a tense expression. “Sometimes, but not all the time.” I heard the faint chatter of other guests in the living room, but they might as well be light-years away. Here, in the kitchen, Alex and I had entered our own little world. “There’s something beautiful waiting for you, Alex. Whether you find it tomorrow or years from now, I hope it’ll restore your faith in life. You deserve all the beauty and light in the world.” I meant every word. Beneath the icy shell, he was human like everyone else, and his broken heart broke mine a hundredfold. “There you go, romanticizing me again.” Alex didn’t move as I took another step toward him, but his eyes burned with intensity. “It’s too late for me, Sunshine. I destroy everything beautiful that comes into my life.” “I don’t believe that,” I said. “And that wasn’t romanticizing you. This is.” Before I could lose my nerve, I stood on tiptoes and kissed him. It was a soft, chaste kiss, but the effect was the same as a full-on make out session. Sparks consumed my skin, and the heat in my stomach flared to life. I shuddered at the sensation, my pulse beating so wildly I couldn’t hear anything else. Alex’s lips were cool and firm, his taste like that of spice and red velvet, and I wanted to wrap myself around him and devour him until every bit of him was inside me. Alex remained still, his chest rising and falling with harsh breaths beneath\n\nmy tentative touch. I pressed a firmer hand against his chest and ran my tongue along the seam of his lips, seeking entry— I gasped when Alex yanked me toward him and deepened the kiss. His hand fisted my hair and tugged, forcing my back to arch while his tongue plundered my mouth. “Not the romance you were thinking of, is it?” he growled, his grip so tight my eyes watered. He’d spun me around so the edge of the counter dug into my flesh, and he used his other hand to hitch my leg up around his waist. His thick erection pressed against my core, and I ground against it shamelessly, desperate for the friction. “Tell me to stop, Sunshine.” “No.” Tell him to stop? A herd of wild horses couldn’t drag me away. I inched my hand beneath his shirt, eager to explore the expanse of smooth skin and hard muscles beneath my fingers. My entire body pulsated with need, and the possibility of someone walking in on us any moment further heightened my arousal. It was only a kiss, but it seemed so much more illicit. Dangerous. Alex groaned. His mouth claimed mine again, and the kiss turned fierce. Wanting. Hungry. He was ruthless in his invasion of my senses, his touch so hot and possessive it branded itself into my skin, and I surrendered to him without a shred of resistance. I was on the verge of unbuckling his belt when he pulled away so forcefully I stumbled forward, disoriented by the sudden loss of contact. My core throbbed, my nipples could cut diamonds, and my skin was so sensitive even the brush of air caused me to tremble. But when the fog of sensation dissipated, I realized Alex was glaring at me. “Fuck.” He scrubbed a hand over his face, his scowl fierce enough to make grown men quake. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.” “Alex—” “No. What the hell were you thinking?” he bit out. “Did you think we would fuck in the kitchen while your friends are in the other room?” Heat scorched my cheeks. “If this is about Josh—” “It’s not about Josh.” Alex pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled a slow, controlled breath. “Not entirely.” “Then what is it?” He wanted me. I knew he did; I felt it, and I’m not just talking about the massive bulge straining his pants. Yes, Josh would attempt to murder us both if he found out what happened, but he couldn’t stay mad at us forever. Besides, he didn’t return to D.C. until Christmas. We had time.\n\n“It’s me. And you. Together. It won’t work.” Alex’s glare intensified. “Whatever fantasies you have of us swirling in that pretty head of yours, kill them. That kiss was a one-time mistake. It’ll never happen again.” I wanted to die of mortification. I wasn’t sure what would’ve been worse —Alex not kissing me back at all, or him kissing me back and saying those things. I wanted to argue, but I’d used up my boldness quota for tonight. It had taken a helluva lot for me to kiss him first, and a girl can throw herself at a guy only so many times before it becomes humiliating. “Fine.” I picked up a random dish in the sink and scrubbed, unable to look him in the eyes. My face felt so hot I thought I’d explode. “I get it. Let’s pretend that never happened.” “Good.” Alex didn’t sound as pleased as I’d expected. We worked in silence save for the clank of the porcelain. “I’m trying to save you, Ava,” he said out of nowhere, right as we finished all the dishes and I prepared to flee. “From what?” I refused to look at him, but I could see him watching me out of the corner of my eye. “From me.” I didn’t respond, because how was I supposed to tell the man determined to save me that I didn’t want to be saved?\n\n20\n\nALEX I WAS ON A WARPATH, AND EVERYONE GAVE ME WIDE BERTH AS I STALKED down the hall toward the elevators. My new assistant, who I’d hired after firing the congressman’s insipid daughter for leaking my cell number to the Gruppmann CEO, pretended to be on the phone when I passed, and the rest of the staff kept their eyes glued to their computer screens like their lives depended on it. I didn’t blame them. I’d been biting people’s heads off left and right for the past week. Incompetent, every single one of them. I refused to entertain any other reason I’d been so cranky since my birthday, especially if that “other reason” happened to be five-five with black hair and lips that tasted sweeter than sin. I ignored the two people who scrambled off the elevator when they saw me enter, and jabbed the button for the lobby. That fucking kiss. It’d tattooed itself onto my mind, and I found myself thinking about it—about the way Ava tasted and felt in my arms—far more than I should. Thanks to the “gift” of my memory, I relived those few minutes in Ralph’s kitchen like they were real every night in the shower, my fist wrapped tight around my cock and my chest burning with self-loathing. I hadn’t seen or heard from Ava since that night. She’d skipped our swimming prep sessions this week, and I didn’t even hear from her directly. Jules was the one who texted saying Ava was busy. Her absence chafed more than I cared to admit. I got into my car and deliberated. One. Two. Three. Four. I tapped my fingers against the steering wheel, torn, before I finally gritted my teeth and\n\nset the GPS for the McCann Gallery in Hazelburg. Nineteen minutes later, I strode into the gallery, my eyes flitting over the pale wood floors, the framed prints hanging on the stark white walls, and the half dozen well-dressed patrons wandering the space before I zeroed in on the brunette behind the counter. Ava rang up a customer, her face animated and her smile bright as she said something that caused the woman to smile in return. She had a knack for doing that, bringing out the joy in others. She hadn’t noticed me yet, and for a while, I simply watched her, letting her light creep into the shadowed corners of my soul. Once the customer left, I walked over, my custom-made loafers silent against the polished floors. It wasn’t until my shadow enveloped her that Ava looked up with a polite, professional smile that wilted the second she saw me. She swallowed hard, and the sight of that small throat bob sent an unwelcome jolt of desire straight to my dick. I hadn’t fucked anyone except my right hand in months, and the celibacy was addling my brain. “Hi.” She sounded wary. “Here.” I placed a brand-new phone—the latest model, which wasn’t available on the market yet and cost me several grand—on the counter. Her brow knit in confusion. “Your current phone is clearly broken, since I haven’t received so much as a text from you in the past five days,” I said icily. The confusion lingered for a beat before it melted into a teasing expression, and my heart kicked like a damn Rockette at Radio City Hall. I made a mental note to discuss this with my doctor during my annual checkup. “You miss me,” she said. My hands curled around the edge of the counter. “I do not.” “You showed up at my work and bought me a new phone because I didn’t text you for a few days.” Ava’s eyes gleamed with mischief. “I think that amounts to missing me.” “You think wrong. I bought you the phone in case you needed a new one for emergencies.” “In that case—” She pushed the box toward me. “I don’t need it. My phone works fine. I’ve just been busy.” “Doing what? Attending a silent ashram in the middle of the desert?” “That’s for me to know and for you never to find out.”\n\nA vein throbbed at my temple. “Dammit, Ava, this isn’t funny.” “I never said it was.” She threw her hands in the air. “I don’t know what you want me to say. I kissed you, you kissed me back, then you said it was a mistake, and we agreed never to do it again. I thought you wanted space, and I gave it to you. I’m not one of those girls who chases after guys who don’t want them.” Ava pressed her lips together. “I know everything’s been messed up between us since Saturday. Maybe we need to…not spend as much time together. I can do the visualizations on my own, and when the time comes, I can find another swim instructor—” My blood pressure hit a record high. “The hell you will,” I snapped. “You asked me to teach you how to swim. I’m the one who worked with you all these weeks. If you think I’m going to let some fucker swoop in and take what’s mine, you don’t know me at all.” Ava stared at me, her eyes wide with shock. “We’re resuming lessons this weekend. Don’t even think of trying to find someone else.” “Fine, no need to yell.” “I’m not yelling.” I never raised my voice. Period. “Then why is everyone staring at us?” Ava winced. “Shit, including my manager. He’s looking right at us.” She busied herself with papers behind the counter. “I promise only to learn swimming with you, okay? Now leave before I get in trouble.” I turned and saw an older male with an unfortunate toupee glowering at us. “Do you get sales commission?” I asked Ava without taking my eyes off her manager, who marched toward us, his paunch jiggling over his belt with each step. “Yes. Why?” “I’d like to buy a piece from the gallery.” I turned back to Ava when her manager reached us. His name tag read “Fred.” Figured. He was a Fred if I ever saw one. “The most expensive one you have.” Her jaw dropped. “Alex, the most expensive piece in the gallery is—” “Perfect for your needs, I’m sure,” Fred cut in. He’d lost his scowl and now beamed at me like I was the second coming of Jesus. “Ava, why don’t you ring this gentleman up for the Richard Argus moonlight piece?” She looked uneasy. “But—” “Now.” My smile cut across my face with the precision of a honed knife. “Careful\n\nwith the tone, Fred. Ava is your best employee. You wouldn’t want to alienate her or any customers who value her opinion very highly, would you?” He blinked, his eyes darting around as his tiny brain struggled to process the not-so-subtle threat behind my words. “N-no, of course not,” Fred stuttered. “In fact, Ava, you stay right here with this gentleman. I’ll pack the piece myself.” “But she’ll get the commission.” I arched an eyebrow. “Yes.” The manager nodded so fast he resembled a bobblehead doll. “Of course.” While he scurried off to another part of the gallery, Ava leaned in and hissed, “Alex, the piece costs $40,000.” “Really? Shit.” “I’m sure we can—” “I thought it was expensive.” I allowed myself a soft laugh at her stunned expression. “It’s not a big deal. I’ll own a new piece of art, you’ll receive a hefty commission, and your manager will kiss your ass until the end of days. Win-win.” Fred returned with a large black-and-white print. Fifteen minutes later, the print had been packaged with the same care one would use to handle a newborn baby, and my bank account was forty thousand dollars lighter. “This weekend, our usual time, Z Hotel,” I told Ava after dismissing Fred. Her eyebrows shot up. We usually practiced at one of our houses or near a lake or Thayer’s pool so she could get more comfortable near water. “It has the best indoor pool in D.C.,” I explained. “You’re ready for actual swimming lessons.” She’d been ready for a while, but I’d wanted to make sure before throwing her into the deep end, so to speak. Ava sucked in a breath. “Really?” “Yeah.” I flashed a crooked smile. “See you Saturday, Sunshine.” I left the gallery in a remarkably better mood than when I’d entered.\n\n21\n\nAVA THE DAY HAD FINALLY COME. I stood five feet away from the pool, my skin etched with goosebumps even though the temperature hovered at a toasty eighty-four degrees thanks to the hotel’s state-of-the-art heating system. I wore a one-piece Eres swimsuit, courtesy of Alex, who’d handed me the shopping bag without a word when he picked me up for our lesson today. After weeks of learning relaxation techniques and acclimating myself to the thought of being in water, it was time for me to get in the water. I wanted to throw up. Panic gripped me, its icy claws digging into my sweat-slicked skin and drawing invisible blood. My stomach pumped in rhythm with my wild heart, causing my breakfast to slosh around like rubber ducks in a bath. “Breathe.” Alex’s calm voice steadied me somewhat. “Remember our lessons.” “Okay.” I dragged in a lungful of air and almost gagged at the smell of chlorine. “I can do this, I can do this,” I chanted. “I’ll go in first.” He stepped into the pool until he was waist-deep in the water and held out his hand. I stared at him, willing my feet to move. “I’ll be right here. I won’t let anything happen to you.” He radiated calm confidence. “Do you trust me?” I gulped. “Y-yes.” I realized with a start that I did. One hundred percent. Alex may not be the nicest or easiest person to get along with, but I trusted him with my life. Literally.\n\nI edged toward the pool and held my breath as I stepped in and grabbed his hand, letting his strength calm my thundering nerves. The water sloshed around my thighs, and I stumbled. The hotel’s pool room spun, the pale blue walls and terracotta tiles flashing before me in a blur. Oh God, I can’t do this. I can’t— “Close your eyes. Deep breaths,” Alex said. “That’s it…” I did as he instructed, allowing his voice to wash over me until most of the panic subsided. “How do you feel?” he asked. “Better.” I cleared my throat and tried to focus on the small radius around us instead of the entire pool. It was a standard Olympic-size pool, but it might as well be the Atlantic Ocean. “I—I’m ready.” As ready as I’ll ever be. We started on the shallow end, and Alex had me walk around so I could get used to the feeling of the water and my body’s buoyancy. After that, we went deeper until I was submerged up to my shoulders. I clung to the relaxation techniques I’d learned over the past few months, and they worked —until we reached the part of the lesson where I had to put my head underwater. I closed my eyes before I dipped my face in, unable to bear the sight of the water rushing toward me. “Help! Mommy, help me!” The words echoed in my head. So cold. So dark. I couldn’t breathe. Something glinted at the edges of my consciousness. A faint memory, perhaps, but it floated away every time I tried to grasp it. “Please!” I sank deeper. Deeper. Deeper still. Pleasepleaseplease. Icantbreathecantbreathecantbreathe. “Ava!” I gasped, the sound of my name jerking me back to the present. My screams echoed against the stone walls before fading into oblivion. I wasn’t sure how long I’d been under. It felt like mere seconds, but judging by how\n\ncold I was and how much my throat hurt, it must’ve been longer. Alex clutched my arms, his face white. “Jesus,” he breathed, pulling me roughly into his chest while I choked out a sob. We were no longer in the pool—he must’ve carried me out during my mini blackout. “It’s okay. You’re okay. We’re out.” “I’m sorry.” I buried my face in his chest, embarrassed and furious with myself. “I thought I could do it. I thought—” “You did great,” he said firmly. “This is your first lesson. There’ll be more, and you’ll get better each time.” “Promise?” “I promise.” I shuddered, curling into his warmth. He felt strong and solid beneath my touch, and I was once again struck by the contradiction that was Alex Volkov. So cold and uncaring to the world, yet so warm and protective when he wanted to be. I’d known him for eight years, yet I hadn’t known him at all. He wasn’t the man I thought he was. He was so much better, even when he tried to convince me he was worse, and I wanted him like nothing before. Not only physically, but mentally and emotionally. I wanted every shadow of his soul and every piece of his beautiful, multilayered heart. I wanted to pour into him every drop of light I had to give until he consumed me whole. Until I was his, and he was mine. We stayed there—me cuddled up against his chest, him with his arms wrapped around me—until my lingering panic faded and I worked up the courage to say what I said next. “Alex…” “Yes, Sunshine?” He ran a gentle hand through my hair. “Kiss me.” His touch stilled, and he stiffened. “Please.” I licked my lips. “Forget about Josh or…whatever else may be on your mind. If you want me, kiss me. I know what we said on your birthday, and I’m sorry for going back on my word, but I need…” You. “I need this.” Alex closed his eyes, his expression pained. “You have no idea what you’re asking me.” “Yes, I do.” I pressed a hand against his abdomen, feeling it tremble beneath my touch. “Unless you don’t want to.” He left out a half-laugh, half-groan. “Does this feel like I don’t want to?”\n\nHe grasped my hand and pulled it down until it rested on the most masculine part of him. My breath stuttered at his sheer heat and size—obvious even under his swim trunks—and I curled my fingers around the thick rod, fascinated by the power I held in my palm. A low growl rumbled out of Alex’s chest. “What did I say about staying out of trouble, Sunshine? Keep doing that, and you’ll be in a world of trouble.” “Maybe I like trouble.” I tightened my grip, and he hissed out a curse. “Maybe I want to stay there.” “I’m beginning to think you’re the trouble I need to stay away from,” he muttered. He pinned my wrist to my side, and a jolt of excitement flashed through me. “But we can’t. You just—” He gestured toward the pool with his free hand. “I just what? Had a panic attack? I get those all the time when I’m near water. If that bothers you, we’re in a hotel. We can find a room.” It seemed like I’d recovered all the boldness I’d lost after kissing Alex on his birthday. His mouth tilted up. “When did you get so feisty?” “When I got sick of everyone treating me like I’m a fragile flower who’ll break if someone breathes on me the wrong way. Just because I have a phobia over one specific thing doesn’t mean I’ll freak out in other areas of my life.” I paused, then added, “Madeline told me. About what you—what you like in bed.” His expression darkened. The air turned ominous, and my heart gave an anxious thud. “What, exactly, did she tell you?” His voice lowered to a dangerous decibel. “She told me—” I gulped. “She told me you only do it from behind. That you don’t like kissing or face-to-face contact during sex. That you…” “That I what?” Alex asked silkily. “That you like choking and calling women names. In bed.” The danger in the air thickened until I could almost taste it, and my bravado faltered. Maybe baiting the tiger wasn’t the best idea… “Yet you’re still here, asking me to kiss you.” His grip on my wrist turned to iron. “Why is that, Sunshine?” He hadn’t denied it, which meant it must be true. My heart raced. “Maybe—” I wet my lips with my tongue, conscious of his eyes tracking\n\nthe movement the way a lion would a gazelle. “I like those things too.” Flames burned away the ice pools in his eyes until the heat seared me to my core. I couldn’t believe I’d ever thought him cold. In that moment, he was a supernova waiting to erupt and swallow me whole. And I’d love every second. Alex released me and stood, no trace of the patient, soothing man from earlier tonight in sight. In its place was something hungry and depraved that caused me to tremble with lust. “Get up,” he said, his voice soft but so commanding I obeyed without thinking. “You’re about to find out what happens when you invite yourself into the lion’s den.”\n\n22\n\nALEX IT DIDN’T TAKE LONG FOR ME TO SECURE THE PENTHOUSE AND ALL BUT DRAG Ava into the luxurious suite. I was so fucking hard my cock almost punched a hole through my pants, and the images I had running through my mind… Fuck. I was going to destroy her, but any remaining shred of conscience I possessed had disappeared the moment she’d uttered those words. Maybe I like those things too. My blood roared at the memory. Baby, you have no idea what you got yourself into, I thought, shutting the door behind me. Ava stood in the middle of the bedroom, wearing a dress over her swimsuit and a half-nervous expression. With her doe eyes and innocent features, she resembled a sacrificial virgin awaiting defilement. My cock throbbed harder. “Take off your clothes,” I said, my soft voice a whip crack in the silence. Part of me wanted to bury myself deep inside her as soon as possible; the other part wanted to savor every moment. Despite a slight shake in her hands, Ava didn’t hesitate. She kept her eyes trained on mine as she unzipped her dress and the gauzy material pooled around her ankles. The swimsuit went next, sliding down inch by torturous inch until a masterpiece of bare golden flesh unveiled itself. I devoured her with my eyes, taking in every detail and imprinting it in my mind. Her skin glowed bronze beneath the suite’s dim lights, and her body…Christ. Round ass, long legs, the sweetest little pussy, and firm, perky tits—not big, but enough for a handful and tipped with hard, rosy nipples that were perfect for sucking and nibbling.\n\nHer chest rose and fell with every breath, and she stared at me with nothing but trust in those big, brown eyes. Oh, Sunshine. If you only knew. I circled her, a predator toying with its prey, so close I could smell the tang of her arousal. I stopped behind her and pressed my body against hers until she could feel my angry, steel-hard erection against the soft curve of her ass. She was naked as the day she was born while I was fully clothed, and somehow that made the scene even filthier. I pressed my lips to her neck, enjoying the rapid flutter of her pulse beneath my mouth. “You want me to take you, Sunshine?” I murmured. “Ruin you, pound you into a pathetic mess, turn you into my little fuck doll?” A whimper escaped her mouth and shot straight to my groin, hardening my already aching cock. “Y-yes.” “You say yes so easily.” I licked the hollow between her neck and lower jaw. True to my nickname for her, she tasted like sunshine and honey, and I wanted to devour her. Feed off her light, consume every inch of her until she was mine and mine alone. “But do you know what it means to be taken by me?” Ava shook her head, a quick, small movement that underscored her innocence and naivete. Not for much longer. Once I got my hands on her, she’d be filthy. Broken. Just like everything I touched. But she’d be mine. And I was selfish and cruel enough that I’d take her with me while I burned down the world. “It means you’re mine. Your mouth is mine…” I rubbed my thumb over her bottom lip before trailing it down her chest and pinching her nipples. She moaned. “Your breasts are mine…” I drifted lower, adjusting my position so I could squeeze her ass. Hard. “Your ass is mine…” I reached around and parted her thighs, sliding my fingers past her slippery folds. She was so wet they were drenched within seconds. “And your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch you—” My other hand closed around her throat. “He’ll end up in pieces, and you’ll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?” Her cunt clenched around my fingers. “Yes.” “Say it. Who do you belong to?”\n\n“You,” Ava whispered. “I belong to you.” “That’s right.” I slipped my fingers out of her pussy and thrust them into her mouth. I hummed in approval when she sucked and licked her own juices off without my asking. “Do you taste that, Sunshine? That’s the taste of you signing your life away. Because from now on, I own you. Body, mind, and soul.” Another moan, this one even more eager than the last. I released my hold on her. “Get on your knees.” She sank to the floor, so beautiful it made my chest hurt and my cock throb. I fisted her hair and tugged it back until she stared straight up at me. “If it gets to be too much, tap my thigh.” When she nodded, I tugged her hair harder and ordered, “Open your mouth.” I slipped the head of my cock into her waiting mouth, slowly pushing deeper until I was buried all the way down her throat. “Fuck.” The sensation of her mouth engulfing me was so hot a shudder rippled through my entire body, and I almost shot my load right there. I hadn’t done that since I was a teenager having sex for the first time. Ava blinked up at me, her eyes watering from my size and how deep I was, but she didn’t tap out, so I stayed still while she adjusted. After what felt like an eternity but was in actuality a few seconds, she started licking and sucking—slowly at first, but quickly building up to a rhythm that had her bobbing her head up and down with enthusiasm. My other hand shot to the back of her head, and my abs shook from the effort not to come down her throat before I was ready. “That’s it,” I growled. “Suck that cock like a good little whore.” The vibrations from her ensuing moan traveled all the way up my spine. I started thrusting into her, faster and faster until the only sounds were that of my ragged breaths, flesh slapping against flesh, and the gurgles coming from her throat. I was so rough I half-expected her to finally tap out, but she never did. I pulled out at the last second and came all over her face and chest, the thick white streaks coating her skin in a glistening sheen. My orgasm burned through me, wild and hot, razing any lingering doubts that stood in its way, and I watched my cum drip off Ava’s chin with possessive, lust-filled eyes. A pale pink flush of arousal stained her face, and her gaze remained locked to mine as her tongue darted out to lick a drop of cum from the corner of her mouth.\n\nHoly fuck. I’d witnessed or partaken in just about every filthy sex act imaginable, but that small movement might’ve been the hottest thing I’d ever seen. “Get on the bed,” I ordered, my voice thick with gravel. “All fours. Now.” Her hands and knees barely had time to hit the mattress before I stripped off my clothes and came up behind her, spreading her thighs with my hands. “You are so very wet, my beautiful whore.” I licked her glistening juices off her skin, savoring the taste and delicate female scent that drove every man crazy. I pushed a finger inside her tight, slick folds and was rewarded with a loud whimper. “Do you want me to eat out this gorgeous cunt of yours?” “Please,” Ava gasped, pushing back at me. “I need—oh God.” She dropped her head, her squeal muffled by the pillows when I flattened my tongue against her clit, alternating between long, slow licks and fast flicks. I was so fucking hungry—for her, for her taste, for the innocence shattering beneath me at this very moment. I feasted on her like a man possessed, my hand digging into her flesh, my fingers curling inside her until I found the spot that had her bucking against my face. I gently tugged on her clit with my teeth, flicking over the sensitive nub with my tongue, and she exploded, her screams reverberating off the walls. “You taste so fucking good,” I growled, lapping up every drop while she shook and trembled beneath my touch. “The perfect appetizer for tonight.” Ava twisted her head to look at me, her face flushed from her orgasm and her eyes round with shock. “That was an appetizer? I thought—you—” “Sunshine, this is a twelve-course meal.” I rolled on a condom and slid my already-hard-again cock along her drenched folds. “And we’re just getting started.” I gripped her throat and slammed into her, and all conversation ground to a halt, unless you counted her moans and my grunts as conversation. She felt like heaven to my hell, the closest I’d ever get to salvation, and yet I still wanted to drag her into the depths of Hades with me. I fucked her so hard I was afraid I’d break her, but every time I eased up, Ava uttered tiny warning growls that had my lips curving in a mixture of satisfaction and amusement. It turned out my sweet, innocent lamb was actually a dirty little slut in disguise, and I’d never been happier to be wrong. I flipped her over in time to see her shatter once more, her pleasureglazed eyes and sighs urging me to go faster and deeper until I, too, came"
