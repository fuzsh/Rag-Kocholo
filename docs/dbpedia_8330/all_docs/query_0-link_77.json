        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nIt turned out that Life was the problem stopping Rozemyne from getting her beloved food and sweets…\n\nFerdinand told her that all feytrees needed Life elements, either as an inherent aptitude or as a transient element supplied to the plant during specific periods of its life cycle.\n\n“I removed all the other elements from the soil first, leaving only one element. The soil in Dunkelfelger can sustain itself with enough mana, even with just one element. If you remove all the mana, the soil turns into white sand. I tried to plant feyplant in different soil samples and the results were the same in 6/7 samples, regardless of the type of feyplant. If the plant doesn’t have Life in its inherent aptitude, it could sprout to become seedlings, grow stems and leaves, even have flowers, but no fruits appeared, and the plant would never reach a harvestable stage.” Ferdinand tapped his temple. “As for the soil that contains only Life, you have to supply Earth, Dark, and Light before sowing the seed so that the non-life feyplant won’t be destroyed. Then Water, Fire, and Wind must be supplied at different stages for the plant to grow. Different types of plants and soils need different ratios of elements at various stages. The Border Gate and the season of sowing also affect the characteristics of the soil, so I can’t tell what is needed for the plants you want in Hauchletzte. It would be better if you asked your scholar to repeat my experiment to find out for yourself.”\n\nTo think that the Royal Family kept that information secluded… how many precious resources had been wasted and forgotten in the whole country?\n\nDuring the talk, Rozemyne noticed that Ferdinand seemed a little uncomfortable when he explained how the ratios differ. He hid it well, but who was Rozemyne? She knew him well enough to sense he was thinking something negative, so she jumped on him and pushed for him to tell her.\n\nCurse the stupid two brothers who founded Lanzenave and Adalgisa!\n\nRozemyne could do nothing except squeeze Ferdinand as tightly as she could, and Ferdinand just silently received her hug.\n\n“I know that you would want to save those people in that place, but don’t act hastily and request it directly from Trauerqual. A young princess like you shouldn’t know anything about that place.” He tried to make a blank face, but Rozemyne could sense that he was very emotional at this moment. “Trauerqual will soon close that place, so if someone needs to stand up in this matter, it must be someone who knows about it, like… my mother.”\n\n“You also want to help them, right?”\n\nIt was a while before Ferdinand resumed his talk. “My mother talked a lot about her elder sister, so I guess she really wants to save them.” He frowned. “It would be quite troublesome for all of them to be freed due to their potential to become Zent candidates and mess up the power balance, but if they could be baptised or adopted as archnobles, then we can work it out a little. Once Trauerqual is crowned and the political state is more stable, my mother could make her proposal.”\n\n“I don’t mind having more Zent candidates! Isn’t it better to have more options to choose from?”\n\n“But they have too strong Royal blood.” Ferdinand sighed. “First, it could give people the assumption that Royal blood still matters the most because all of them could get the wisdom. Second, those people don’t have real political backing and also don’t have proper education to be a ruler, which means they could become puppets under either Klassenberg or Werkestock. Third, most of Adalgisa citizens are ladies, and given their low political power, there would be a bunch of arrogant princes aiming to use them just to become King, like what happened to you in the last weave. Finally, with all Adalgisa children able to get the book, it could signal Raublut to contact Gervasio and bring him back earlier. Talking about mana capacity alone, I hate to tell you that the current countries have no one who can compare with that guy.”\n\n“You talk like you already have a candidate in mind.”\n\n“The best person to push into a Zent position must be someone from greater duchies to have a sufficient mana base, political backing, and the proper education to deal with all the aftermath and lead the system reform. That person also needs to be someone who can work well with us and is innovative enough to accept new ideas in temple reform and changing the common sense of this country. I intend to choose Lady Adolphine.” Ferdinand listed his reasons. “Being from Drewanchel makes Adolphine meritocratic enough, and we can involve her in the shrine tour with the excuse of research purposes. Compared to other great duchies, Drewanchel and Ahrensbach have less Royal blood as they are already several generations removed. There are also candidates from the Second or Third Wives, but their mana base would be low in both quantity and quality, and given their mana being too rigid, it would be hard for them to gain more colour. And choosing Ahrensbach also means we are likely to face Georgine’s children.”\n\n“NO!!! Absolutely not Detlinde!!!”\n\n“I would never consider her. I actually consider Georgine’s son, Wolfram!”\n\n“Bwuh?! Wait, he is alive?”\n\n“Now? Yes, he has successfully been baptised and is the same age as me. Maybe this time, with no clear winner or loser, Georgine won’t have the chance to be promoted, and that boy won’t climb to the towering heights at an early age. But still, Ahrensbach is quite a problem that we cannot ignore.”\n\nFerdinand pinched the bridge of his nose hard, and Rozemyne sighed in understanding. Ahrensbach was really in a tough spot. The children of the First Lady were all girls and all married out. The choice for Ahrensbach would be between either the children of Werkestock’s wife or the children of Georgine. Before they can get the Book of Mestionora, the Gate of Darkness will remain wide open, and Lanzenave could attack at any time.\n\n“We only have Blasius’s brother and Wolfram to consider for the position. I have started to gather intel about Blasius’s brother, and I will assess Wolfram at the Royal Academy. If possible, we could avoid the adoption of Letizia.”\n\n“You’re worried about our Letizia?”\n\n“No, I’m not. Don’t put words in my mouth. I just find it quite annoying that her parents try to meet either one of us just to silently look hopeful for any news.” Ferdinand scoffed. “And we have to prepare for the Lanzenave war. We don’t know when the attack will happen this time, and letting Letizia be involved in this war would mean a security hole for Lanzenave to exploit. It would save Roswitha and Sergius from moving to Ahrensbach. The same applies to your side; keep that stupid son of Magdalena on track so he won’t mess up again and throw a tantrum in front of us!”\n\n“While your comment about Hildebrand is very rude, it doesn’t deny that you care about Letizia and Sergius. Could you please be honest with yourself a little bit? Yet I hope you could be more open to the influence from Dunkelfelger rather than just being corrupted by Ditter.”\n\nThat was a very dangerous comment, thus Rozemyne’s cheek once again suffered.\n\n“ow ow ow ow ow ow…”\n\n“Huhm… cheeks are still better than ears…”\n\n“What does it mean?”\n\nFerdinand just smiled, satisfied, while enjoying Rozemyne’s 'puhi puhi' as he pinched her cheeks.\n\nRozemyne woke up with a very unsatisfied look on her face. Funnu! Just wait! I will pinch him very, very hard next time for revenge!!!\n\nAnd the first sentence she spoke in the morning to her retainers was: “I need to look for a very skilled artist!”\n\nDrawing, pictures, cardboard cutouts, standees, key chains, voice-recorded plushies...\n\nNo one can stop me from selling “Ferdinand merchandise” anymore. This time, I will dry up all the wallets of Dunkelfelger for revenge once I enter the Royal Academy!\n\n.\n\nSondern received Rozemyne’s instructions about the new direction of rice research and just shrugged, saying that her \"dreamy boyfriend\" was skilled. Of course, he immediately received a hit from Desdemona. Rozemyne did think about how to remove the suspicion from her retainers. She could meet Ferdinand only once a week in her dream, so there was no way she wanted to abandon this opportunity. However, Sondern’s reaction made Rozemyne worried, and she wondered whether she should pray to Ordoschnelli and Schafltraum to make some exception for her and Ferdinand to meet whenever they wanted.\n\nIt was very time-consuming and advanced skills required for this research, and in the end, Sondern involved Michelle and even ran to the castle to ask for more scholars to help them, but no one accepted. It was later that Fabiane told her Heinrich was the main reason why most scholars seemed uninterested in this project. To sum up, he didn’t want to shut down Rozemyne completely, but he also thought plant paper and rinsham were more than enough and lady-like for her to focus on, not “wicked weed”. With this answer, Rozemyne could only sigh.\n\nAt least the research started to show positive outcomes, as Sondern ran to report that they could now confirm the importance of the Life attribute in plantation. Michelle suggested that they should collect more feyplants to test and publish the results in next year’s Interduchy Tournament to contribute to Rozemyne’s winter debut.\n\nBut all the ideas came from Ferdinand, with the source of information being Seradina, and Rozemyne definitely didn’t want to steal it. However, Ferdinand consoled her in their weekly meeting, saying he welcomed Hauchletzte to publish this research to avoid Seradina being suspected. Ferdinand said Hauchletzte could publish the research about the Life element in cultivation, while he would push Dunkelfelger to focus on the ratio of elements needed to increase the purity of the materials gathered.\n\nTalking about their meeting in a connected dream, unfortunately, the circle could not be used outside of Earth day. Ferdinand suggested they could push for the research to be published at the same time during Rozemyne’s winter debut, and Ferdinand would find a chance to go to the Royal Academy that year so they could meet each other and use the research as an excuse for later letter exchange. Better to lay a little groundwork so that no one found it strange they were so familiar later in the Royal Academy.\n\n“When you enter the Royal Academy, we must avoid meeting in dreams, or else someone could connect the dots. My retainers have recognised my strange timetable already. It’s too bad we cannot delay our meetings until a later time at night because our bodies cannot handle it.” Ferdinand crossed his arms. “We better prepare so that when we exchange letters, no one becomes suspicious. At that time, we can use disappearing ink. No one will suspect, and being students could help us avoid being checked by our parents.”\n\nThat was another problem. Rozemyne would be fine using disappearing ink, but Ferdinand was not. There are five other Omni beside him in Dunkelfelger, and no one could know whether the letter Rozemyne sent could accidentally fall into their hands. Due to the last incident of exchanging letters with Anastasius, even if no one said anything, Rozemyne understood that all her letters were now screened by Kreszentia before sending. She never faced this problem in Ehrenfest, but she couldn’t be certain because she was now unbaptized, and information management during the civil war might be stricter.\n\nGiven how big Ferdinand’s rampage was recently, maybe every letter of his was pre-scanned too.\n\nSince Ferdinand had prepared a good plan, Rozemyne just needed to focus on her side. New season came and the first batch of rice had been harvested—not much, but enough to make a proposal to Aub Hauchletzte. After eating the grilled eel rice bowl, Sondern never questioned any new ideas from Rozemyne anymore. It was indeed annoying to hear him praise eel every time they met, but at least for Rozemyne, he was easier to control just by using eel. Now, the mystery of her ‘Rice’ had been solved, there was no way she would allow her beloved Japanese cuisine to pass her by.\n\nAs much as Heinrich used to be annoyed with the fact his granddaughter loved the wicked weed so much, he finally accepted that he must treasure that ‘weed’ now because Rozemyne just invited all her guardians to a dinner and fed them a small banquet with all rice dishes.\n\n“I’m sorry, Aub Hauchletzte. I know you don’t like my rice, so from today onwards, there will be no rice served for you, and it will be forever banned from your dining table.” Rozemyne smiled, puffing out her chest smugly.\n\nOh, the face of Grandpa is indeed a nice sight to see...\n\nAs expected of an experienced Aub, Heinrich showed a perfect noble smile to thank Rozemyne for such a wonderful meal. He tried his best to avoid the temptation of the food and leave the dining room with noticeable speed, but Rozemyne had prepared her trap properly. She ordered that every meal of hers must now use rice as an ingredient, so other people who shared meals with her but were not on the list of \"approved people\" would have to eat their hard, plate-like bread while watching her enjoy her beloved rice.\n\n“Aub Hauchletzte, Princess Rozemyne sent me to deliver some of her new inventions for everyone working in the office. Please enjoy! This dish is my new favourite dish, a rice bowl topped with grilled eel, and don’t worry, Aub Hauchletzte, this is not for you but for everyone else.”\n\n…The pen in Heinrich’s hand was broken!\n\n“Aub Hauchletzte, I came to deliver the progress report on paper making. Have you tried the new rice balls? They come with dozens of stuffing flavors to choose from. Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot that milady has banned all rice products from your dining table. Okay, everyone, I brought some samples for you guys, come on, enjoy!”\n\n…The wooden board in Heinrich’s hand had a crack!\n\n“Ah, such a nice smell. Aub Hauchletzte, please stop staring at me; I’m just following milady—also your own granddaughter’s—order. I came to deliver the new curry rice to Engraulios to thank him for his help in researching Karyda and Koryth.”\n\n…Engraulios was as pale as a ghost!\n\n“May I be excused, Aub Hauchletzte? It’s time for me to eat, and today Princess Rozemyne granted me the chance to try her new dish, a steamed bun stuffed with seafood. Ah... the smell of Aminos braised Tunfisk is so attractive, but the salted and spicy braised veggie is nice, too.”\n\n…How many pens had already been broken?\n\nWell done, Sondern! As expected of the weirdo of Hauchletzte, the only one who dared to provoke the Aub of the duchy!\n\nA week later, Heinrich invited her for a tea party and tried his best to probe for a share of any new meal. He actually asked to buy the recipe first, but there was no way Rozemyne could just agree to sell them to him. Her goal with all these traps was not money.\n\nFinally submitted to the pressure, the mighty Aub Hauchletzte agreed to read Rozemyne’s proposal about the future plantation of rice and Karyda. As for Koryth, Rozemyne decided to leave it out of her plan because those trees were very essential for fishermen, and new products from Karyda would be more than enough.\n\nAfter a whole day of back-and-forth discussion, Heinrich gave permission for building a special greenhouse to cultivate rice and continue the research on supplying the Life attribute to Karyda. At this moment, with suggestions from Ferdinand, Sondern and Michelle successfully explored the final ratio of different transient elements supplied for rice plantation. It was recommended that high-purity Life and Dark materials would be required. The sowing must be at the end of Spring to reduce the Water elements in the environment as much as possible, then the Life element would be supplied in the middle of Summer to push for the reproduction stage. Depending on random tests of elements in the plant, other elements might be required, such as Dark to balance Light, Water and Life or early injection of Wind for harvesting. All the mana would be spread inside the closed greenhouse via magic circles carved in the wall. The first plantation would be next year, and depending on the results, they would continue to see which Giebe land would be considered for the rice industry.\n\nHowever, due to the limited source of mana supplies, plus the dozen tools and machines needed, the newly harvested rice grains were put under a very high cost. Rozemyne wanted to protest, but this time even her retainers opposed.\n\n“Hauchletzte is very active in trading; thus, there are dozens of slots for trading. Every new trend needs to be solidified inside the duchy first to adapt to the trade required from greater duchies and the Sovereignty. There must be at least three years for this rice plant to provide a sufficient amount. Then, if the research about those elements needed to cultivate feytrees is correct as you guys proposed, soon all the fey specialities of each duchy would be no more special. As long as they can get the seedling, they could just cultivate it by themselves and all the benefits would fall into the hands of greater duchies. We have to secure our benefits first before the greater duchies get involved.”\n\n“I suddenly feel relieved that due to the lack of this wisdom, middle and lesser duchies have things to exchange, actually.” Engraulios sighed.\n\nThe way he spoke indeed sounded blissful, but the reality was not as honourable as they thought. That knowledge was hidden all because those higher ranks wanted to keep secrets and benefits for themselves.\n\n“I do not agree! If I can guess about it, soon there will be other people who find it out. Rather than waiting passively, wouldn’t it be better to publish this knowledge and gain the exchanges we want first? At least we are at the forefront of this. And this is my research, actually, conducted under my direction by my retainers. Either Hauchletzte does it and gets its share, or it will belong to me all along. As you said, I have the seedling already, which means I can plant it on my own and anywhere in the country.”\n\nFerdinand had assured her that Dunkelfelger would publish the research about the modification of elements in mana supplies in cultivating feytrees next year. Rozemyne had no idea how he would push for it, but she needed to make Hauchletzte publish it at the same time.\n\nUnder her threat, Heinrich had no choice but to agree to all her conditions except the price of rice. But he promised that once the rice industry was secured and stable in Hauchletzte, plus if they found another, easier, and less costly way to supply Life elements, he would consider lowering the price to what Rozemyne suggested.\n\nVaitiare sighed that the operation of the mana circle for supplying Life elements in the greenhouse was too costly for such a low-price and wide-spread product as wheat and other cereal grains. She lamented that if they could grow Karyda inside the greenhouse, it would be more cost-effective.\n\nActually, they just need to supply Life via foundation and Spring Chalice.\n\nIt turned back to the problem at the beginning: no one else has Life in their mana except her. However, Rozemyne felt that she could hint at the temple rituals first, and it got rejected once again.\n\n“Engraulios and Sondern told me that after the subjugation, the blue priests from the temple would perform the healing ritual by the Flutrane Staff. That ritual is counted as the Spring ritual, right? Michelle told me about the dance of Dunkelfelgerian Lords and Ladies performed before Ditter with a spear, so that is a Summer ritual.” Rozemyne tried to persuade everyone, “There must be a similar ritual related to Autumn or Winter. How about looking at the temple records to see if there are any rituals that were lost?”\n\nThe Archducal couple glared at those scholars when their names were mentioned.\n\n“I see your point here. I will appoint Engraulios to investigate.” Heinrich waved his hand dismissively, “However, Rozemyne, never ever repeat what you just said in public. We know you did not mean any harm, but the way you spoke made it sound like you were grouping the rituals of the Dunkelfelger Archducal Family with those from the lowly temple. This is highly disrespectful and insulting.”\n\nThere is definitely a long way to rectify everyone's perspective on the temple…\n\nRozemyne sighed inwardly. From the time she re-weave until now, she had never stopped appreciating Sylvester’s skewed perspective and his bias toward allowing Ferdinand and her to do anything they wanted.\n\n“Okay, Rozemyne, it was a good discussion today. Let your grandfather handle the business and the greenhouse. You should focus more on your baptism and winter debut next year.” Vaitiare changed the topic, “We will need two dresses for you, and they will need to be tailored carefully.”\n\n“Speaking of that, it was decided that Lady Magdalena will be escorted by your uncle this year at the Graduation Ceremony, signaling their match. She will visit Hauchletzte next summer for the engagement ceremony and will also attend your baptism. Dunkelfelger will use this event to secretly send escort knights to protect you during the winter performance at the Royal Academy,” Kreszentia informed. “Rozemyne, you should focus more on polishing your socialization skills. You seem fine until something you care about is involved. Sudden praying to give blessings out of nowhere or rushing your retainers forward for books or new food ingredients are absolutely - unacceptable - for - a - princess!” The last part was pronounced with heavy stress.\n\nOops…\n\n“Indeed, we saw that your emotional state was not good last winter, so we decided to let you be free of your studies and enjoy yourself for a while,” Vaitiare smiled. “Compared to many children your age, you excel in Math, Literature, Theology, Music, and even Magic, but the Art of Grammaratur is something you still need to practice.”\n\n“Maybe we should start with the art of naming first.” Sondern shrugged, “Milady, your food is delicious, but its name is bloody difficult to say.”\n\n“That is also a start,” Engraulios nodded. “It would be good to hide the real name of the plant we use in the dish to keep it secret from spies from other duchies. We still have to be cautious about Kirschnereit.”\n\nMichelle suggested that ingredients like “fish sauce” or “rice” could be kept because they were condiments and cooking ingredients, not standalone dishes, so even if anyone knew about them, no one could suspect anything. “Aminos” was also a nice name to keep since no one could relate it to salted fermented Karyda juice. As for Coconut sugar, okay, Rozemyne admitted she wanted to use a name that could show her Coconut sugar was much more premium than Lanzenave sugar.\n\nLet’s see, coconut sugar was originally made from coconut sap harvested from the flower. After concentrating the sap, you got coconut nectar - a thick, syrupy liquid that was also the starting form of sugar.\n\nFlower, Sap, Nectar… Ah!\n\n“Let’s call it Efflorelume’s Nectar!” Rozemyne clapped her hands and beamed with pride.\n\nWhat a beautiful name suited for the noble dining table! Come on, someone praise me for such improvement in using noble euphemism.\n\nPUU!\n\nCRACK!\n\nBANG!\n\nCLANG!\n\nUrg… What happened?\n\n“You guys don’t like Efflorelume because she is a subordinate goddess?” Rozemyne tilted her head. Maybe this was the reason; after all, Efflorelume was mostly used in neutral to negative euphemisms. “How about… Flutrane’s Nectar? Or Flutrane’s Water? Or Flutrane’s Sweetener?”\n\nWait a minute, why do I suddenly feel like I’ve heard this term before? Whoever had told me?\n\nNah, never mind!\n\n“Although it comes from the juice of the fruit, it is used as a sweetener, so I think relating it to nectar would be better,” Rozemyne continued, explaining her ideas. “Since we need to avoid mentioning Karyda to keep it a secret, I still think it should be either Efflorelume or Flutrane.”\n\nThe entire room remained frozen.\n\nFerdinand is now in Dunkelfelger, so how could his \"processing error\" spread here?\n\n“Karyda tree is a secret tree that needs Life to grow, so how about ‘Ewigeliebe’s sweetener’?” Rozemyne immediately shook her head. “No, Ewigeliebe could be misunderstood as something negative. How about… a tree of course needs to grow on the soil… Geduldh’s nectar? Geduldh’s sweet treasure? Geduldh’s…”\n\n“PLEASE STOP TALKING!!!” The whole room burst out.\n\nThe next day, Heinrich ordered Engraulios to lead an army of “scholars” to her bookroom and review every book in it, while Rozemyne was stuck with the two grandmothers in a hidden room to check her “knowledge.”\n\nShe was luckily not grounded because everyone found it was just a “mere coincidence.” No one dared to suggest Rozemyne give new names anymore, and funnily enough, the term “Coconut sugar” was immediately accepted since it was still better than any beautiful noble names Rozemyne suggested.\n\nAs for the little bookworm princess, after being ambushed, she cradled her head and covered herself inside the blanket in her hidden room just to hide from all the secondhand embarrassment.\n\nI’m sorry, Lieseleta! I’m sorry, Leonore! I’m sorry for forgetting all your “bride lessons”!!!\n\nAnd curse whoever first thought about using not only winter but also spring vocabulary for 18+ content!\n\n."
