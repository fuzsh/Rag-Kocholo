        "text": "The Wings of Fire series is wildly popular and ever since I did this post about books to read if you’ve loved Harry Potter and this one about Percy Jackson read alikes, I’ve gotten a flood of DMs asking for one for the Wings of Fire books.\n\nI asked on Instagram for suggestions and there are SO many good books like Wings of Fire to jump into once you’ve finished that series (transparently, I haven’t read the Wings of Fire series, but I know enough about it to know what books would make good readalikes).\n\nI’m sharing the ones that our family has loved and then I’ll share the recommendations from other families that we HAVEN’T read at the bottom so you’ll have even more ideas for books similar to Wings of Fire!\n\nbooks like wings of fire\n\nEragon Series by Christopher Paolini\n\n5 book series\n\nAfter finding out his destiny of a Dragon Rider, teenage Eragon and his loyal dragon must navigate a dangerous world of magic and power as they struggle to overthrow the evil King Galbatorix. Bart read this whole series years ago when it came out and it’s been fun to see my kids enjoy it now!\n\nThe Unwanteds by Lisa McMann\n\n7 book series\n\nThe book starts on the day of the sorting and Alex knows he’ll be an Unwanted, because of his interest in creative endeavors. He’s already been reported for a number of infractions, including scratching images in the dirt with a stick, so it’s no surprise to him when he’s named as one who will be sent to die in the Lake of Boiling Oil. (Full review here)\n\nDragon Masters by Tracey West\n\n27 book series\n\nThis fantasy adventure is perfect for any child who loves dragons, kings, wizards, and magic! My girls have listened to this series a million times over the past few years – it’s definitely on the younger side (the books are more like 100 pages), so they’re perfect for a child to read solo if they’ve been listening to Wings of Fire or for a child who wants to be like an older sibling!\n\nDealing with Dragons by Patricia C. Wrede\n\n4 book series\n\nPrincess Cimerone is terribly bored. Being a princess is bad enough. Being the SEVENTH daughter in a royal family is worse. Naturally, there is nothing to do but run away from home and face a dangerous dragon. Because dangerous is better than boring. (Full review here)\n\nFablehaven by Brandon Mull\n\n5 book series\n\nThis is a great series about two kids, Seth and Kendra Sorensen who go to spend a few weeks with their grandparents on their very remote property. It doesn’t take them long to figure out not everything is as it appears. The butterflies and dragonflies in the garden are actually fairies! That is only the beginning of the magical creatures that inhabit Fablehaven. These have been wildly popular in our house this year. (Full review here)\n\nDragonwatch by Brandon Mull\n\n5 book series\n\nThis is the companion series to Fablehaven where the adventures of Seth and Kendra continue as they try to save the world from Dragons who want to overturn the sanctuaries and destroy the world. The two precocious teenagers really come into their own in this series and learn more about themselves and their own unique powers.\n\nDragon Slippers by Jessica Day George\n\n3 book series\n\nAfter being orphaned Creel’s aunt tries to sacrifice her to the local dragon, instead, Creel befriends him and unknowingly inherits an object that will either save or destroy the kingdom.
