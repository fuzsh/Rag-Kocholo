        "text": "Jack Morgan: The Leader\n\nJack served in the Marines, where he saw action in Afghanistan and was involved in a helicopter crash that killed most of his squadron. After returning from duty, he took over and rebuilt Private, the agency founded by his father, Tom. Jack restored the first-class reputation Private lost after Tom’s Incarceration and death, opening up offices all around the world.\n\nJack has a twin brother, Tommy, who takes after his father and with whom he has an intense rivalry. Tommy enjoys tormenting Jack and even has gone as far as to threaten to kill him.\n\nWith his cool demeanor and good looks, Jack is a ladies’ man who has trouble settling down due to his inability to share his innermost thoughts and feelings with others.\n\nJustine Smith: Second-in-Command\n\nJustine is number two at Private. A psychologist by trade, she uses her smarts, training, and determination to solve cases.\n\nFormerly, Justine and Jack dated seriously. They even went as far as to buy a house together, though she moved out when the relationship ended.\n\nRick Del Rio: Investigator\n\nRick served in the Marines with Jack and is the only other survivor of Jack’s helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Rick got into some trouble upon his return home from the service, but after a four-year prison term during which he spent his time studying criminal law, he accepted Jack’s offer to come work for Private.\n\nWith a quick temper, Rick has the tendency to get himself into hot water when on a case.\n\nEmilio Cruz: Investigator\n\nEmilio is an investigator at Private. Once a world-ranked prizefighter, he stepped out of the ring and became a police officer. Eventually he left the force and worked as a private investigator for the District Attorney’s office before joining Private.\n\nHe has a bulldog-like tenacity when it comes to getting the truth, and long hair that he usually keeps in a ponytail."
