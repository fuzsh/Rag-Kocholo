Dragons are the current dominant species of both Pyrrhia and Pantala, and the main perspectives of the Wings of Fire books.

Dragon species are known as tribes, and there are currently eleven known tribes. The Pyrrhian tribes consist of IceWings, MudWings, NightWings, RainWings, SandWings, SeaWings, and SkyWings. The Pantalan tribes consist of HiveWings, LeafWings, SilkWings, and the now-extinct BeetleWings. LeafWings and BeetleWings formerly lived on Pyrrhia, but fled to Pantala due to an unknown trouble.[1]

Biology and anatomy[]

Dragons are sentient and sapient species capable of speaking both the dragon and human languages,[2] constructing tools, composing literature, and complex thought. The BeetleWings and LeafWings spoke the Pantalan language prior to Clearsight's arrival on the continent, calling Dragon 'the old language.'[3]

Dragons are quadrupedal. Pyrrhian dragons, as well as LeafWings, possess six limbs, consisting of two wings and four legs. HiveWings and SilkWings have eight limbs, consisting of four wings and four legs. Dragons have five toes on both forelimbs, accompanied by five claws. Dragon hindlimbs have four toes, accompanied by four claws and a dewclaw. Some dragons, such as Six-Claws, may be born with polydactylism. Dragon bones are difficult to break, as they are described to be almost as hard as diamonds,[4] but they can be dislocated.[5] All tribes are roughly the same size except for MudWings, who are larger and stronger than dragons from the other tribes,[6] and SeaWings, who are considered to be shorter than dragons from other tribes.[7] Additionally, SkyWings have notably larger wings than most tribes.[8] Dragons do not have sexual dimorphism.[event 1]

They have lengthy natural lifespans, but are susceptible to injury,[9] illness,[10] and poison.[11] The longest average dragon lifespan is said to be roughly one hundred and fifty years,[event 2] but the oldest dragon known to live without the use of magic was Tapir, at one hundred and ten years.[12] Dragons reproduce via eggs that take a year to hatch.[13] Eggs may contain twin dragonets.[14] Dragonets can speak within a day of hatching,[15] and a one-year-old dragonet is capable of speaking in full, if broken, sentences. Most dragons at three years of age can fly, but cannot fly for long periods without stopping to rest.[16] SkyWing dragonets can fly at one year old,[17] and are known to molt their scales upon growth.[18] Dragonets stop growing rapidly at seven years old, which is considered adulthood or maturity in most tribes.[19] Dragons grow rapidly for the first eight to ten years of their life, but continue to grow at a much slower rate for the remainder of their lives,[event 3] as demonstrated by Grandeur, Morrowseer, and Darkstalker. Older dragons are typically the largest.

Wings are attached to a dragon's shoulders and have a slightly transparent wing membrane stretched between five small bone digits, each of which has one small claw on the tip. A larger claw is attached to the front of the third digit. All dragons are capable of flight, but SilkWings hatch without wings and cannot fly until their wings grow in during their Metamorphosis. Dragons require their tails for flight, and severe tail injuries may ground a dragon for life.[20] Pyrrhian dragons are known to have a vulnerable spot at the tip of their tails.[21]

Dragons have overlapping scales that vary in color and shape from tribe to tribe. Some dragons hatch with freckles, splotches of color, or other unusual patterns on their bodies or wings. They can also have birthmarks, and in the case of SeaWings, Aquatic birthmarks.[22] Dragons have skin underneath their scales.[23][24]

Dragons can faint,[25] sweat,[26] and cry.[27] Dragons can also have allergies[28] and become intoxicated.[29] They can have seizures,[30] hiccups,[31] as well as other medical conditions including deformities,[32] tumors,[33] mental illnesses,[34][35] or eye conditions.[36][37] Most dragon tribes hate getting wet,[4] except for SeaWings, RainWings, and sometimes IceWings[38] and LeafWings.[39]

Dragons have a hoarding instinct, preferring shiny or brightly colored objects.[40] Pyrrhian dragons typically barter with gold, gems, and other treasure,[41] but they also have coins that are used as currency.[42] Pantalan dragons use a currency called scales.[43]

Hybrids[]

Hybrids are dragons with parents from different tribes. They have a mix of physical features from both of their parent tribes. Many of them look unique among other dragons, while some can blend in with one of their parent tribes.[44] Burn may have had several stuffed hybrids in her collection.

Diets[]

Most dragons are omnivorous, but many have primarily carnivorous diets. SilkWings prefer a plant-based diet.[45] RainWings are primarily vegetarian, but can eat meat if they choose to do so so.[46] Dragons of non-vegetarian or non-herbivorous tribes may choose to be vegetarian.[47] Most dragons can survive for up to a month without food.[48]

Dragons sometimes drink beverages such as milk,[49] tea,[50] and coffee,[51] and eat sweets such as chocolate,[52][53] cookies,[50] honey drops,[54] and ice cream.[55]

Specialization[]

Each tribe has specialized structures and abilities that differentiate them from other tribes.

Pyrrhian abilities[]

Tribe Abilities IceWings IceWings can withstand subzero temperatures and very bright light.[56] They have serrated claws for gripping ice, which can also be used offensively in battle.[57][58] They have sharper eyesight than the other Pyrrhian dragon tribes.[59] IceWings can exhale a freezing weapon called frostbreath, which appears as a cloud of sparkling smoke.[60] MudWings MudWings can breathe fire if their bodies are warm enough.[61] They can hold their breath for up to an hour and blend into mud. They are usually physically strong. MudWings hatched from blood-red eggs have fireproof scales.[62] NightWings NightWings can breathe fire and blend into dark shadows.[63] They have a strong sense of smell[64] and powerful night vision.[65][66] NightWing dragonets hatched under one full moon have the power of mind-reading or prophecy, and those hatched under two full moons have both. Dragonets hatched under three full moons have both powers, which are further enhanced by the third moon. RainWings RainWings have prehensile tails which are used for climbing trees and swinging through the rainforest.[67] They are capable of absorbing sunlight, which gives them energy and makes their scales become more vibrant. RainWings can manipulate their scales to be any color they wish to blend into their surroundings or express their emotions,[68] and they can also change the color of their eyes.[event 4][69] They can spit a corrosive venom that dissolves organic materials.[70] Some are capable of mimicking bird calls.[71] SandWings SandWings have scales that radiate warmth.[72] They can breathe fire, bury themselves in the desert sand for camouflage, and survive on very little food and water.[73] They also have sharp hearing and smell,[74][75][76][77] and barbed tails which capable of injecting venom that can kill a full-grown dragon.[78] SeaWings SeaWings can breathe and see underwater, and are strong swimmers.[79] They have exceptional night vision[80] and powerful tails.[81] SeaWings have bioluminscent stripes on their bodies which are used to converse underwater[82] and attract partners.[83] They can control when the stripes on their bodies glow and can light up each one individually. Different combinations of stripes indicate different words in Aquatic. SkyWings SkyWings have enormous wings[84] and are capable of flying long distances due to their stamina.[85] They can breathe fire and are considered powerful fighters.[86] They can see farther than other dragon tribes.[87] A SkyWing dragonet in a twin egg may develop firescales, a condition where their scales are incredibly hot to the touch and can ignite anything flammable by merely making physical contact with it.

Pantalan abilities[]

Tribe Abilities HiveWings HiveWings powers vary from dragon to dragon. Abilities include deadly stringers that can extend from their wrists to stab targets, venom in their teeth or claws,[88] a paralyzing toxin known as nerve poison[89] that can immobilize targets, or spraying a boiling acid from a stinger on their tails.[90] They can also emit a horrible stench.[91][88] HiveWings have a precise internal clock that keeps their days on schedule and warns them when the rainy season is coming.[92] SilkWings SilkWings can spin silk from glands on their wrists to create webs and other woven articles such as tapestries.[93] They can detect and sense vibrations with their antennae to assess threats.[94][95] SilkWings have a precise internal clock that keeps their days on schedule and warns them when the rainy season is coming.[92] They are also great climbers.[96] Some SilkWings have the power to produce flamesilk. LeafWings LeafWings can absorb energy from sunlight and are accomplished gardeners.[97] Some possess leafspeak, which allows dragons to talk to plants and can be used to convince plants or seeds to grow at an accelerated rate.[98] BeetleWings BeetleWings were rumored to have antennae and the ability to shoot venom.[1] Some could use flamesilk.[99]

Dragon fire smells different from normal fire.[100] The average dragon is physically strong enough to rip a tree from the ground and throw it across a short distance.[101] Some dragon tribes, notably the IceWings, NightWings, SeaWings, and SkyWings, have animus magic, which allows the user to enchant inanimate objects, plants, animals, and other dragons as they please.

Society[]

Dragons live in a matriarchal society where each tribe is, in most cases, ruled by a queen. Typically, tribes live in separated kingdoms; after the events of the NightWing Exodus, the NightWing tribe is now ruled by Queen Glory, and after the events of The Flames of Hope, the SilkWing tribe now resides in the LeafSilk Kingdom along with LeafWings and some HiveWings, and are governed by the SilkWing Assembly. In most tribes, queens are hereditary and decided through the royal challenge or other means. The SandWing tribe uses the Eye of Onyx which chooses the best queen for the job, and may choose a commoner over a royal. No male dragon had ruled a tribe since the time of the Scorching.[102]

Most dragons feel strong loyalty to their tribes, and loyalty to dragons outside the tribe is considered unnatural.[103] They view their tribe as extremely important to their identity and consider acting against others of their tribe or their queen to be traitorous. Some tribes, notably the NightWings, IceWings, HiveWings, and SkyWings, see their tribe as superior to other tribes. In formal settings, it is common for dragons to use their tribe as a title, i.e. "Prince Arctic of the IceWings."[104]

Some dragon keep pets, such as scavengers, sloths, foxes, cats, or birds. Pets do not do well in dragon communities, as they often get eaten by forgetful relatives or even by its owner.[105] Dragons are careful not to eat pets belonging to important dragons.[106]

Each dragon tribe has their own religious beliefs.[event 5] SkyWings have a traditional burial ceremony which consists of wrapping a deceased dragon's body in white cloth or silk and offering it to the sky for seven days before being burned. It is said to allow the dragon's spirit to fly free and reincarnate into a SkyWing instead of a dragon from another tribe.[107] IceWings swear by the Great Ice Dragon, and have several temples dedicated in its honor. IceWings believe in snow monsters[108] and spirits under the ice.[109] Dragons may believe that the world hatched from eggs.[110][40] The Pantalan dragons see Clearsight as a divine being of guidance and wisdom.

Body Language[]

Dragons use body language to communicate with each other. Dragons may raise their wings in a shushing gesture,[111] and they spread or wave their wings to catch attention. Flicking one's tail at someone is another way to get another dragon's attention and can also be used to indicate something of interest[112] or signal to other dragons. Flicking wings at one another indicates an argument. A dragon lashing their tail is a sign of anger or impatience.[113] SeaWings may flare their gills when angry,[114] and RainWings flare and color their ruffs when angry or indignant.[115][116] Drooping one's wings or tail are typically signs of tiredness, sadness, or hopelessness.[117]

The Talons of Peace have a signal for greeting one another, consisting of tilting one's wings to catch the sunlight. Dragons can use their claws to indicate numbers.[118]

Nudging or brushing another dragon's wing or twining tails together is a sign of affection and closeness.[119] Wrapping wings around one another, hugging, and pressing snouts together are also signs of affection.[120][121] Dragons also kiss to express affection.[122] Dragons tent their wings over others as a way to comfort or embrace them in a protective gesture.[123][124]

Technology[]

Dragons use armor[125][126] and handheld weapons such as spears[127][128] and swords.[129][130] They also use throwing weapons such as throwing discs,[131] chakrams,[132] and throwing knives.[133] SkyWings use dragonflame cacti as bombs, igniting them to explode and spray sharp seed pods.[134][135]

Dragons are skilled at building and can construct large, impenetrable palaces, such as the SandWing stronghold and the SkyWing Palace. Some of these palaces may be constructed with the assistance of animus magic, such as the Summer Palace and the IceWing palace. They can also build structures such as huts and construct entire towns such as Possibility. Dragons are also capable of constructing prisons. The SeaWings used a waterfall prison featuring electric eels strong enough to kill a full-grown dragon, which could be turned on or off with a switch.[136] The SkyWings had specifically constructed prisoner traps[130] and restrained prisoners with wing clamps,[137] snout clamps,[138] and chains.[138] HiveWing wrist cuffs could inject venom into a SilkWing when activated remotely.[139]

Dragons are particularly skilled in the arts. They can carve statues,[140][141] create glass art[142] and murals,[143] weave woven articles such as tapestries,[144] and paint.[145][146] They are also skilled in making jewelry such as earrings,[147] armbands,[148] bracelets,[149] and rings.[150] Some dragons have tattoos[151][152] or jewels embedded in their bodies.[125][151] Dragons enjoy reading and writing literature. They are capable of singing and dancing,[153] and playing instruments such as drums, mbiras, shakers, harps, stringed instruments, and didgeridoos.[154] The SkyWings have orchestras who perform music during celebrations.[155] According to Sunny, the SandWings are a surprisingly musical tribe.[156] The NightWings once put on theatrical performances, evidenced by the abandoned theater in the lost city of night.[157]

The NightWing tribe in particular places great emphasis on research and study. This attitude was especially prominent during the War of SandWing Succession when the tribe had a research and experimentation program on RainWings and their venom. NightWings also study geology, metalworking, biology, chemistry, genetics,[158] and calculus.[159] NightWings can predict when an egg will hatch using their foresight ability.[160] SandWings study astronomy by making telescopes, copying down star charts, and tracking the phases of the moons.[161] Lady Scarab is known to own the only telescope in Cicada Hive.[162]

Dragons are also knowledgeable about medicinal uses of herbs and dragon anatomy such as blood vessels.[163] RainWings create blow darts using poison from poisonous frogs.[164] LeafWings, particularly the PoisonWings, demonstrate extensive knowledge of plants and insects, and constructed the PoisonWing village to keep out dangerous plants and animals.[165] Both Pyrrhian and Pantalan dragons have knowledge of ophthalmology through the ability to construct eyeglasses.[166][43]

Pantalan dragons have more advanced technology than Pyrrhian dragons. Pantalan dragons predominantly use books instead of scrolls,[167] grow plants in terrariums and greenhouses,[168] work with sugar to create confections,[169] and have plumbing.[170][171]

History[]

Pyrrhia[]

The earliest known event in Pyrrhian history is the Scorching. Before the Scorching, humans dominated Pyrrhia, and dragons lived solitary lives.[40] There were three known major settlements: Cottonmouth's empire, the Diamond Empire, and the Jaguar Empire. After humans began stealing dragon eggs, a dragon known as the first Dragon Queen recruited an army to take back their treasure and land.[172] After the Scorching was complete, dragons became the dominant species of Pyrrhia.[172] Following the events of the Scorching, there was 500 years of war between the Pyrrhian dragon tribes.[173]

As evidenced by the scroll Ancient Wars of Pyrrhia, many wars have occurred through Pyrrhia's history. The most long-standing conflict was the NightWing-IceWing War, incited by Foeslayer running away with Prince Arctic to the Night Kingdom.[174] There was no formal end to the war as the NightWings fled due to Clearsight's warning about Darkstalker.[175] When Darkstalker was released after the events of Escaping Peril, he reignited the conflict by creating the IceWing plague and instigating the Battle of Jade Mountain. The conflict is on pause after the events of Darkness of Dragons.[176]

Another notable conflict in Pyrrhia's history was the MudWing Succession Crisis, where the Mud Kingdom dissolved into chaos and was pillaged by other dragon tribes, who took territory, prey, and treasure.[177] It was resolved by Olive, who offered her eggs to Prince Sawgrass to serve as future heirs while she ruled as queen in the meantime.[177]

The most recent known war was the War of SandWing Succession, a succession war between Queen Oasis's daughters Blaze, Blister, and Burn. The war ended after the Eye of Onyx chose Thorn to be queen.[178]

Pantala[]

The earliest known Pantalan event is the settling of Pantala, which was chronicled in the Legend of the Hive. After an unidentifiable amount of time, Clearsight arrived on Pantala. Her visions, which were recorded in the Book of Clearsight, described several events that took place before the Tree Wars, such as droughts,[179] forest fires,[180] and the formation of the HiveWing tribe.[181] Scarab states that the BeetleWing tribe split into the SilkWing and HiveWing tribes around 4,500 AS.[182]

The only known war to take place on Pantala was the Tree Wars, taking place about fifty years prior to the events of The Lost Continent. The war was incited by Queen Wasp, who attempted to bring the SilkWing and LeafWing tribes under her rule. She justified her actions using the Book of Clearsight, claiming that it said the tribes must be united under Queen Wasp.[50] Monarch yielded to Wasp, but Queen Sequoia demanded to see the book,[50] resulting in the Tree Wars and the LeafWing tribe's near-extinction. Wasp ordered HiveWing-controlled areas to be deforested to prevent the LeafWings from coming back. HiveWings lied about the war, claiming that the LeafWings had tried to wipe out the HiveWings and SilkWings.[183]

Trivia[]

Tui supports dragons having unique colors amongst their tribes.[event 6]

In addition, Tui approves the graphic novel pages, thus making odd-colored dragons official.[event 7]

Dragons can be LGBT+.[citation needed]

The dragon tribes are intentionally not written with accents or details based on real-world human culture.[event 8] However, the audiobooks depict NightWings with British accents and RainWings with Australian accents, which are considered to be non-canon by Tui.[event 9]

Dragons celebrate the day they were hatched, calling it a hatching day instead of a birthday.[184]

Some dragons could knit in the time of Darkstalker.[185]

Bars and taverns exist in Pyrrhia.[114][186]

According to Fierceteeth, dragons always assume that the dragonet inside an egg is a female.[187]
