A homeowner in the nearby mountains says he's lucky to be sleeping in his home after a fire came too close for comfort Sunday afternoon.

I thought I was prepared for it," said Ted Ruiz, who lives in Shaver Springs Community. "You really can't prepare for something like this and making that call to my wife that I was evacuating, that was a tough call.

It was a tough call Ruiz had to make, deciding if he was going to try and protect his home or grab his dog and go.

"My realtor texted me and said, hey, you have a fire right behind your guys' cabin," he said. "So I got on my deck, and lo and behold, back over there, the flames were jumping over the mountain, coming our way... and it was kind of unnerving."

With flames creeping over the hill, he wanted to make sure sparks weren't flying too close for comfort.

I really thought we were going possibly lose our home and the homes in the neighborhood when the flame jumped the hill," said Ruiz. "The wind was coming our way, and I was standing on my deck and it was it was too late to even continue wetting anything down.

When he was about to lose hope, CAL FIRE swooped in.

"If it wasn't for the fire crews, I don't think we would have had 20 minutes to get out of here," said Ruiz.

He watched fire crews contain the fast-moving wildfire at just eight acres.

"It was an amazing feeling when we saw them put it out," said Ruiz.

A battalion chief with CAL FIRE told FOX26 fire crews try to put all wildfires out this quickly.

CAL FIRE said crews would remain on the scene overnight at Tollhouse Road and Highway 168 to keep an eye on hot spots.
