Angela Davis, one of the nation’s leading advocates for prison reform and abolition, gender equity, and racial and economic justice will be their guest. The social justice activist’s topic will be “Freedom is a Constant Struggle”.\n\nThe free event will be held on Tuesday, November 15th in the Brown & Williamson Club at Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium on Floyd Street. All seating is first come, first served basis for the 6:00 p.m. talk.\n\nDavis is an accomplished author and lecturer with engagements all over the United States, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America. She’s published eight books including an anthology of her writings and speeches: “Freedom is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine and the Foundations of a Movement.”\n\nFollowing the talk, there will be a book signing.\n\nThis educator and a vocal activist in the Civil Rights Movement draws upon her own experiences in the early seventies as a person who spent eighteen months in jail and on trial, after being placed on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted List.\n\nYou may remember that Davis was a visiting professor with the University of Louisville in 2002. She taught women’s and gender studies course.\n\nDavis, a longtime friend of the late Anne and Carl Braden, wrote the foreword to the biography “Subversive Southerner: Anne Braden and the Struggle for Racial Justice in the Cold War South,” written by institute director and UofL professor Cate Fosl.\n\nThis lecture series and institute are named for the Bradens who were active in the civil rights movement in Louisville\n\nTo learn more about the 10th annual Anne Braden Memorial Lecture Series go to www.louisville.edu/braden.\n\nYou can also follow me on Twitter @Sherlenemediapr and Instagram @Sherlenemediapro."
