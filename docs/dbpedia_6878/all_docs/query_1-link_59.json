        "text": "Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research\n\n\"The Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research, a program within the University of Louisville College of Arts and Sciences, was founded to honor the work and legacy of longtime racial justice organizer, educator and journalist Anne Braden. We seek to advance public understanding of the U.S. civil rights movement, both its powerful history and its unfinished agenda of racial and social justice. The Institute was established in November 2006 by the University of Louisville Board of Trustees.\"\n\nAnne Braden Oral History Project\n\n\"This project focuses on the life of Anne Braden, an anti-racist activist, organizer, and journalist. These interviews were conducted by Cate Fosl for her oral history based biography on Anne Braden, Subversive Southerner: Anne Braden and the Struggle for Racial Justice in the Cold War South (2006). Interviewees include Anne Braden, as well as her coworkers, mentees, and friends. Specifically discussed is Anne's life growing up, her career as a writer, particularly at the Louisville Times, and her marriage to Carl Braden. Other topics include the Braden's involvement in the civil rights movement, their association with the Wade family, and their sedition trial in 1954. Interviews also contain discussions about the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and the Ghandi Corps.\""
