All are The bill lists 27 organizations in which the Bradens allegedly were active; four \"Communist publications\" which allegedly articles written by them; and 43 items of \"Communist, Communist-front and seditious\" literature and other material seized from the Bradens. Zollinger's motion to suppress the evidence states that books and papers, now in possession of the Commonwealth \"illegally taken by raids made upon the residence of the defendants without their knowledge and consent and in their absence from the said residence .\n\n\"They (the Bradens) state that all material seized therein consisted of matters legally: in possession of the defendants and private to them. They state that publication of such material and its possession to divers organs public information has been without, their consent or approval.\" The motion asks that the material be returned to the Bradens. The material was seized by members of the Commonwealth's attorney's staff while the Bradens were in jail after being indicted for advocating sedition. They have since been released on bond. Judge Curtis overruled motions by Zollinger to: 1 .\n\nDismiss the indictments against the Bradens on the ground the bills \"have not alleged an offense recognizable at law.\" 2. That trial dates for all persons indicted in the so-called \"Wade case\" be assigned immediately. So far only Braden, of seven persons charged in the case, has been assigned a trial date. Called Part of Conspiracy The charges against the seven came after a County grandinvestigation of an explosion that damaged the home of Andrew Wade, IV, a Negro contractor who moved into a white neighborhood near Shively.

Overhaul of Western College Business Setup Advised President Hails Report; Says Action Taken By ANNE PARDUE The Courier-Journal Frankfort Bureau Frankfort, Nov. State Budget Division has recommended a complete overhaul of Western Kentucky State College's business practices .\n\nMost of the recommendations have been put into effect, President Paul L. Garrett wrote Governor Wetherby and the college's board of regents. Garrett's letter, released today, termed the Budget Division's financial study an \"outstanding contribution to Western.\" \"By making an intensive analysis of and a general revision in our plan of expenditures and in- Dodge has done it Flair and alive with beauty!

The Budget Division team that made the study, Garrett said, \"are highly trained and skilled in the analysis of financial management of public institutions of higher learning. \"This group did not make just another quick, superficial survey, leave a staggering bill for their services, back to New York or Chicago.\" College Asked for Study Western requested the study because it anticipates increased enrollment and wants to be prepared for it. Further, there was the need for tighter control over its budget. For the past few years, Western's expenditures have exceeded its receipts .\n\nBut surplus funds from the years of World War II have enabled the school to keep operating in the black. Western also realized that a revision of its internal business affairs was necessary because it was unable to know from time to time exactly where it stood financially. A modern accounting systema change from the manual-ledger method to the machine-posting method -will correct this. Budget Director Took Part The study was begun July 1 by L. Felix Johner, director of the budget; Gerald L .\n\nMaguir, assistant director; James L. Miller and Walter Gattis, budget analysts, Smith, assistant derector of accounts. The Team recommended: 1. An internal operating budget to be made an integral part of day-to-day administration of the college. The team recommended that Western operate on a $1,263,500 budget this year .\n\nOf this amount, $669,550 is the State's appropriation. Included in Western's budget, unlike many other colleges, is the college athletic fund of around $100,000. The total also includes a $76,000 surplus from last year. 2. Installation of an adequate accounting system should be among the first changes .\n\nThe machine-posting method should replace the handwritten method of keeping books. Classification of accounts should be studied thoroughly to achieve uniformity. Maintenance Costs Noted 3. Functions and services of the business office need to be clearly defined and delegated. 4 .\n\nBetter co-ordination of maintenance department. The study recommended that $35,000 be designated as a maintenance New 55 DODGE at your dealer's now! For months the word has been getting around: \"Dodge has done it!
