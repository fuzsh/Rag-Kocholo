        "text": "Rally and march for improved Medicare for All.\n\nSat. July 24, 2021, at 11 AM\n\nMazzoli Federal Bldg., 600 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Pl.\n\nWe will begin at 11 AM in the park in front of the Federal Building where we have permission from the city to use the site. We will set up under the trees near the corner of 7th & Chestnut so speakers and participants alike will be in the shade.\n\nWe will have speakers (brief) and music then march and/or caravan to Breewayy, the square at 6th between Liberty and Jefferson.\n\nThere we will place flowers in honor of Breonna Taylor, to connect with her profession as a healer, and to link the struggle for health care with the fight to end systemic racism. We will return to where we began and share refreshments and socialize.\n\nWe will also be celebrating Medicare’s 56th birthday. We hope you will join with us in demanding that Congress take action by passing a national single payer, improved Medicare for All plan. Such a plan would end the tragic denial of care that causes so much suffering and unnecessary loss of life.\n\nCosponsors: (list in formation)\n\nKentuckians for Single Payer Health Care, Physicians for a National Health Program-KY, Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Greater Louisville Central Labor Council, Independence Seekers, Movement for a People’s Party-KY, Clifton Universalist Unitarian Church, Kentucky Alliance for Retired Americans, Metro Disability Coalition, UAW Local 862, Central Kentucky Council for Peace and Justice, Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research, Carl Braden Memorial Center, Association for the Study of African American Life and History, La Casita Center, Louisville Fellowship of Reconciliation, Fairness, Louisville Showing Up for Racial Justice, Kentucky State AFL-CIO, LIUNA Local 576, Lexington DSA, Sowers of Justice, Louisville State Chapter of the National Action Network\n\nNational Events list.\n\nThe national website is here\n\nFurther info: Kay Tillow (502) 636 1551, nursenpo@aol.com\n\nPrint the flyer"
