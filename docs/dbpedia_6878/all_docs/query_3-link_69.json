        "text": "By Kelsey Westbrook\n\nI first saw Dan Canon at an emotionally charged Black Lives Matter rally and march in August at the Carl Braden Memorial Center in West Louisville. The rally took place just after the atrocious “Unite the Right” rally that turned violent and deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia — one of the largest white supremacist events in recent US history. People from all walks of life gathered in solidarity to hear activists and community members from various organizations speak on making change, becoming better allies and accomplices, and holding one another accountable — particularly white people, and our friends and families. Dan was introduced as a civil rights attorney running for Congress in Indiana’s 9th district as he approached the Braden Center’s front porch and was handed a megaphone.\n\nAdmittedly, at first glance, I thought to myself, “oh, joy, another white guy running for office. That’s just what we need,” yet as he spoke to the crowd, his impassioned words cut through the sweltering heat. He was humble yet fervid. He spoke frankly about racism deeply entrenched in our systems and white supremacists’ goal of the “eradication and subjugation of black bodies.” I soon found out that he’d represented the plaintiffs in Kentucky’s same-sex marriage case, one of five states that made up the Supreme Court’s historic marriage equality ruling in June 2015. He’s been an outspoken advocate and voice for the oppressed time and time again through his career as a civil rights attorney. Dan Canon’s magic has begun permeating through our communities, and folks from all paths want to get involved to ensure his seat in Washington as a representative of Indiana.\n\nThese folks include, but aren’t limited to, burlesque dancers, drag queens, fire eaters, sideshow artists, and more. So how can these artistic performers and creatives put their talents to use to raise funds and awareness for Canon’s campaign? For them, it’s all about owning their power and Dawn Howard, Canon’s finance director, has an unconventional birthday celebration in the works to do just that.\n\nOn January 12th, Zanzabar will host the “Flip the House Party” from 8PM-2AM as a celebration for Howard’s 39th birthday doubling as a fundraiser for Canon’s campaign. Howard teamed up with Camila Jasis-Wallace, a brilliant sideshow performer and creator of “Brunchlesque”, to curate an incredible evening of entertainment and imaginative mayhem. In addition to the burlesque oddling and fire performance stylings of Camila’s Artemesia de la Miel, The Flip the House Party will feature members of Octo Claw’s Bizarre Bazaar, the Va Va Vixens, Hashtag Productions (the drag creation of #Sofawnda Peters-Cumming, Gag the Mermaid, and several other drag performers based in Nashville), The Winchowskers Experiment (a duo of sideshow/clown/burlesque lovers from Bardstown), and more.\n\n“Camila knows Dan through the theater community and had offered to coordinate a burlesque fundraiser for him,” said Howard, “Mark at Vectortone had previously offered up a (Zanzabar) night for free and Alex Smith (AKA musical artist, Howell Dawdy) had previously offered to donate a karaoke roulette night,” thus the Flip the House Party was born through colliding her birthday celebration with these generous and talented donors for an evening benefitting the campaign. Howard adds that karaoke roulette is her “absolute favorite thing in Louisville.” Tickets are $15, however, you can also purchase a “Happy 39th Birthday Dawn” ticket for $39, to wish her a special day of birth and contribute a greater gift to the campaign.\n\n“I’m a huge fan of Dan and Dawn and the changes they are trying to bring to the White House,” says Jasis-Wallace. “Many of us feel powerless against this current political juggernaut we are facing, and we are resisting with what we have: vaudeville . . . drag, burlesque, sideshow, clowning.” Jasis-Wallace explains that these creative expressions were once all political, and that it’s important right now to bring the strength and threat of politicized art back into our communities and daily lives.\n\nJasis-Wallace and her comrades have felt the profound and deliberate moves made by the administrations (Trump & Bevin) to erase and debase queer folks, people of color, women and femmes, the disabled, Muslims and more. “We use our own bodies in response,” she added. And, it seems as though drag and burlesque performers aren’t the only ones using what they have to make change, as the world watched the women (and men) of Hollywood don black attire in solidarity at the Golden Globes on Sunday and proclaim “Time’s Up” on tolerating discrimination, harassment and abuse. These political acts fostered and executed within our own realms are validation that we can reclaim our power — an inertia that’s been suppressed or robbed from us for far too long — and use it to create change.\n\n“This isn’t a conventional fundraiser, or a conventional campaign,” said Congressional candidate, Dan Canon, “I am fortunate enough to know a lot of talented people from all walks of life. It’s very gratifying to see so many of those people willing to lend their talents to make our country a better place. Our message in holding events like this should be clear: everyone is welcome at this great table we are trying to build.” In addition to the message Canon promotes with this event, I believe there’s another takeaway to procure: 2018 will be a year of resistance, in every way imaginable, and folks will begin using what they have — our own personal power ranges from skill sets to talents to attending events whilst drinking bourbon — to dismantle the system, dissent and resist."
