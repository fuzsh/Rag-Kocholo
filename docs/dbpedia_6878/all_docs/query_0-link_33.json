        "text": "Anne Braden was remembered at a special church service at St. George Episcopal Church, Louisville, KY. Over 50 years, Anne worked for justice for all. She was known throughout the South and was a noted figure in Louisville. With her husband Carl, they purchased and sold on the \"Wade House\" to the African-American Wade family, who were simply seeking a home in south-western Louisville, outside of the \"red lined\" West End of Louisville. The home was dynamited within weeks. The Branden's were arrested for sedition and Carl was convicted and imprisoned for over a year before the Supreme Court overturned the conviction on the grounds that sedition was a federal issue, not one for the state of Kentucky to be involved in.\n\nCarl died in 1975. Anne continued her work until she passed in 2006.\n\nTurns out that Angela Davis has some history with UofL, having been a visiting scholar in the early 2000's. She returns to deliver the 10th Anne Braden Memorial Lecture. The venue is a larger hall in one of the several stadiums on the UofL campus. Even so, the turn out is HUGE and even with people standing in the back, late comers had to be turned away! And the crowd was a mix of older and younger, of color and white, even children brought by parents to hear a voice from history that is still speaking out for justice.\n\nLight levels and the distance I ended up standing from the podium result in some softness in these photos. The interior images were taken using ISO 6400. I only use this high an ISO on this camera when I have no choice. Most images are at a focal length near the 300mm maximum of my long zoom, equivalent to 450mm on a 35mm sensor/film. Shutter speeds are around 1/50 second. This totally violates the normal rule of thumb for shutter speed versus focal length. However the lens has stabilization and I leaned against a wall as much as possible."
