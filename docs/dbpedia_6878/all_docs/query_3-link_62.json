        "text": "West Louisville apparently is not interesting enough to recommend to people who visit Louisville.\n\nThe Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureaus visitors guide fails to include the neighborhood in its feature, The Boroughs of the Ville, and on an accompanying map.\n\nReally?\n\nIn an email responding to LEOs questions, Stacey Yates, vice president of marketing communications, said West Louisville is not in the story because it did not meet the criteria: a neighborhood that had at least 10 points of interest in the Eat, Shop and Discover categories.\n\nBy that measure, St. Matthews, Anchorage and many other neighborhoods were omitted, Yates said.\n\nI will say we probably need to add some more copy on this new neighborhoods section that explains that these are not all of the neighborhoods in Louisville. Perhaps that would help eliminate some confusion, Yates said.\n\nAs for other listings in the magazine, the bureau includes only its partners, so, for example, the American Legion  Shawnee Post is in, but the The Kentucky Center for African American Heritage is out, Yates said. In my search of our partner database, I could find no West Louisville restaurants, she said, adding that personally she would have put Jays Cafeteria in bold if it still existed.\n\nIf you go to the bureaus website, you might find West Louisville treated differently than are many of the other neighborhoods, listing the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage and Muhammad Alis Boyhood Home  but no places to eat or shop.\n\nYates said information is still being added to the website, which was recently rebuilt. Our hope is to add other neighborhoods in the future that have a high concentration of visitor experiences, Yates wrote, adding that the East End and downtown website entries also do not list places to eat.\n\nWell, then...\n\nWe know West Louisville has more than 10 points of interest, but here is a shorter list, just in case you are relying on only the visitors guide and website. It is drawn from a 2014 LEO story by Dana Duncan.\n\nOh, yes, we would have given you a list of places to visit and see in St. Matthews, but we couldnt think of any. (JK-ing!)\n\nEat\n\nBig Mommas 4532 W. Broadway | 772-9580 A Louisville legend, you might want to call ahead to make sure they didnt run out of your favorite.\n\nForty Acres & A Mule 1800 Dixie Highway, (just north of Algonquin Parkway) | 776-5600 Soul food done well, featuring prepared and fresh selections.\n\nSweet Peaches 1800 W. Muhammad Ali Blvd. | 356-0232 Pamela Haines serves up breakfast all day, including breakfast sandwiches, baked goods and waffles. Coffee, tea, soups and other items are also available. Combo meals including a side and drink make this spot another great lunch option for the downtown crowd.\n\nRoof Top Grill 708 Louis Coleman Jr. Drive | 785-4069 Excellent, reasonably priced Jamaican food and very friendly folks.\n\nShop\n\nBetter Days Records (West) Lyles Mall, 2600 W. Broadway | 774-9909 Another branch of the locally-owned record store.\n\nDiscover\n\nBraden Home 4403 Virginia Ave. The former home of local civil rights legends Anne and Carl Braden, and a meeting place for countless activists from every corner of the globe.\n\nCarl Braden Memorial Center 3208 W. Broadway | 778-8130 Dedicated in memory of the local activist and husband of the equally-remarkable Anne Braden, the center has served community groups, progressive organizations and youth working against racism and for progressive social change locally, nationally and internationally since 1969.\n\nMuhammad Alis Childhood Home 3302 Grand Ave. | 890-5995 alichildhoodmuseum.com Newly opened, the home has been lovingly restored to its original condition, which required a bit of forensic architecture. Look for the historic marker out front.\n\nKentucky African American Heritage Center 1701 W. Muhammad Ali Blvd. | 583-4100 A beautiful repurposing of the citys former trolley barn, it is open for special events and available for rentals."
