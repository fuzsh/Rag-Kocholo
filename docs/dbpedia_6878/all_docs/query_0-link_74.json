        "text": "The two organizations often get confused, but the Anne Braden Institute for Social Justice Research, publisher of this tour, is at the University of Louisville, and the Carl Braden Memorial Center is here at 32nd and Broadway. This building has been used as an activist headquarters since Anne and Carl Braden purchased it in 1969, when they became directors of the New Orleans based civil rights group SCEF and moved its national headquarters here. SCEF stands for Southern Conference Educational Fund. The organization worked closely with Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and was a leading proponent of integration and civil rights in the South. The Braden’s were both journalists as well as radicals and staunch white allies to the civil rights movement, and they edited SCEF’s newsletter, The Southern Patriot for many years after they were unable to get jobs in Louisville (for reasons we tell you about when we get to the Braden home). This site is longtime home to the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, and it remains a hub of local antiracist activism. The building became the Carl Braden Memorial Center after his death in 1975, and Anne worked here until her death in 2006."
