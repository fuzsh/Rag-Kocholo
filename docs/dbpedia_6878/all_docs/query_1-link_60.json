However, we, as well as the entire social justice community in Louisville, KY, work everyday through our programming to combat violence by educating, informing and training our community about the systemic issues that plague us.\n\nWe make sure that we address and agitate those at the policy level (making the city accountable and calling on transparency from local/state government), showing up and showing out (protesting), or providing programming that fuels our community with the tools they need to make peace with their neighbors; grassroots initiatives of to build the change we want to see. We invite those within the community to join us in building a larger coalition to achieve these goals. We invite those from the social justice community to join us as we condemn the attack of black bodies, minds, and spirit. We call on you to assist in the liberation of all people by the liberation of black lives.\n\nStand Up Sundays Coalition Partners"
