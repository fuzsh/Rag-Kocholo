        "text": "Heading into college football's conference championship weekend, here's each team's simplest path into the top four with a win and possible avenue with a loss.\n\nThere's a scenario where this year's College Football Playoff doesn't include the champion of the SEC.\n\nHere's all that would take: Alabama beating Georgia, Michigan beating Iowa, Washington beating Oregon, Florida State beating Louisville and Texas beating Oklahoma State.\n\nIn this case, the top four would begin with the unbeaten Wolverines, unbeaten Huskies and unbeaten Seminoles. While this would be a judgment call by the playoff selection committee, the fourth spot could very well go to Texas, thanks to the Longhorns' non-conference win in Tuscaloosa earlier this season.\n\nWhile on the hold-onto-your-butts end of the spectrum, that's just one of dozens of scenarios that could unfold during conference championship weekend.\n\nHere's how things could play out for the eight teams still in playoff contention, with each team's simplest path into the top four with a win and possible avenue with a loss:\n\nGeorgia\n\nHow the Bulldogs get in:\n\nBeat Alabama.\n\nGeorgia has lost all three previous SEC championship game matchups with the Crimson Tide. Winning this one would lock the Bulldogs into the top seed.\n\nHow the Bulldogs get in with a loss:\n\nLouisville beats Florida State.\n\nOklahoma State beats Texas.\n\nThis would leave Michigan as the No. 1 seed and Washington the No. 2, should the Huskies beat Oregon. (Alabama could rise as many as six spots to No. 2 should UW lose, though the Crimson Tide would match up with the Ducks either way.) With Florida State and Texas also eliminated, Georgia would be in competition for No. 4 with Ohio State, and that's a comparison the Bulldogs would win.\n\nMichigan\n\nHow the Wolverines get in:\n\nBeat Iowa.\n\nThe Wolverines would be the No. 2 seed if Georgia beats Alabama.\n\nHow the Wolverines get in with a loss:\n\nGeorgia beats Alabama.\n\nWashington beats Oregon.\n\nLouisville beats Florida State.\n\nOklahoma State beats Texas.\n\nThis would leave a field of Georgia, Washington and two teams from the Big Ten in the Wolverines and Buckeyes.\n\nWashington\n\nHow the Huskies get in:\n\nBeat Oregon.\n\nWashington could be the top seed if Alabama beats Georgia and Michigan loses to Iowa, but the Huskies are guaranteed to be no lower than No. 3.\n\nHow the Huskies get in with a loss:\n\nGeorgia beats Alabama.\n\nIowa beats Michigan.\n\nLouisville beats Florida State.\n\nOklahoma State beats Texas.\n\nThe key result is Iowa beating Michigan, since that would make Ohio State the third-place team in the Big Ten; that should eliminate the Buckeyes, though the committee could decide otherwise. With the Tide, Seminoles and Longhorns also out of the mix, the teams left standing would be Georgia, Oregon, Washington and Michigan. While the Huskies would have the better résumé, they'd be dropped to No. 4 in this scenario to avoid a third scheduled matchup with the Ducks.\n\nFlorida State\n\nHow the Seminoles get in:\n\nBeat Louisville.\n\nDon't buy into the theory that Florida State could be left out with a win against Louisville. Unbeaten Power Five champions have been and will continue to be locked into the four-team field, so the Seminoles really have nothing to worry about.\n\nHow the Seminoles get in with a loss:\n\nNo chance.\n\nIf Georgia, Michigan and Washington win, one-loss Florida State gets bounced by Texas. If Georgia, Michigan and Texas win, the Seminoles lose the comparison to Oregon. If all four unbeaten teams lose, the playoff would consist of Alabama, Oregon, Georgia and one of Michigan, Ohio State or Washington. Basically, there are guaranteed to be enough one-loss teams still standing after Saturday to keep the Seminoles out of the field with a loss in the ACC championship.\n\nOregon\n\nHow the Ducks get in:\n\nBeat Washington.\n\nOregon could be the No. 1 seed with wins from Alabama and Iowa. Importantly, though, the Ducks would likely move ahead of unbeaten Florida State and avoid a semifinal matchup with Georgia. (Unless the Ducks would rather play the Bulldogs than Michigan, in which case that's not a good thing.)\n\nHow the Ducks get in with a loss:\n\nNo chance.\n\nThat would be Oregon's second loss. Even the fact that both came to an unbeaten Power Five champion and even if both losses are by a single possession won't be enough for the Ducks.\n\nOhio State\n\nHow the Buckeyes get in:\n\nGeorgia beats Alabama.\n\nMichigan beats Iowa.\n\nWashington beats Oregon.\n\nLouisville beats Florida State.\n\nOklahoma State beats Texas.\n\nYeah, the Buckeyes need help. Specifically, Ohio State must get Oregon, Florida State and Texas out of the equation. As you can see, this scenario demands something very uncomfortable from the Buckeyes' fan base: rooting for Michigan to beat Iowa.\n\nOPINION: Texas could be a major snub when College Football Playoff field is announced\n\nTexas\n\nHow the Longhorns get in:\n\nBeat Oklahoma State.\n\nGeorgia beats Alabama.\n\nLouisville beats Florida State.\n\nFirst and foremost, Texas needs FSU to lose in order to open up a spot in the field. While wins by Texas and Florida State, in conjunction with an Alabama win, do create the environment where the SEC does not reach the playoff, this also sets up the scenario where the Longhorns are in competition for the fourth spot with the Crimson Tide and Bulldogs. Even if the committee continues to place huge value on the head-to-head win against the Tide, this is a scenario the Longhorns would want to avoid. So to be safe, the easiest way into the top four also includes an Alabama loss.\n\nHow the Longhorns get in with a loss:\n\nNo chance.\n\nTwo-loss Texas is out of the picture.\n\nAlabama\n\nHow the Crimson Tide get in:\n\nBeat Georgia.\n\nIn this scenario, Alabama would come in ahead of Florida State and meet the Pac-12 champion in the semifinals. As mentioned, the Tide could be the No. 2 seed if Oregon beats Washington and might end up No. 1 if the Ducks win and Iowa tops Michigan.\n\nHow the Crimson Tide get in with a loss:\n\nNo chance.\n\nTwo-loss Alabama has no shot."
