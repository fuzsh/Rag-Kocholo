        "text": "An 85-year-old Huntingdon County man has lost his appeal to a 10- to 20-year prison sentence imposed on him last year for the attempted homicide of a woman living in his neighborhood.\n\nState police arrested Gary G. Harbst of Foster Road, Union Township, on June 6, 2022, and charged him with setting fire to a nearby home in which his intended victim — an 81-year-old woman — was living with a relative. He was 83 at the time of the incident.\n\nA Huntingdon County jury eventually convicted Harbst of attempted homicide, two counts of arson, aggravated assault, criminal mischief and recklessly endangering another person.\n\nSenior Judge Carol L. Van Horn of the Franklin-Fulton County Court of Common Pleas sentenced Harbst to a prison term of 123 to 246 months.\n\nHarbst is incarcerated in the State Correctional Institution, Houtzdale, Clearfield County.\n\nHarbst, through State College attorney Wade Bradburn, appealed his conviction, contending there were no witnesses who saw him setting fires that day in a car and boat in the yard as well as the house.\n\nThe fires destroyed the home.\n\nThe prosecution in the case charged that Harbst fired a .22-caliber rifle into the home in an attempt to block any escape route, but the intended victim was able to flee after seeing Harbst leave the area.\n\nThe defense argued the evidence used to convict Harbst was insufficient to prove his guilt.\n\nHe, for instance, at the time used a walker to get around, which the defense claimed “made it impossible for him to go to the (home) and set multiple fires.”\n\nPolice found a rifle along the side of a road that they believe was used to fire shots into the burning home.\n\nBut, the defense emphasized, Harbst’s DNA was not found on the gun and no gun residue was found on his person.\n\nA Superior Court panel that included Judges Judith F. Olson, Deborah A. Kunselman and Correale F. Stevens stated it disagreed with the defense that the evidence was insufficient to convict Harbst.\n\nThe victim in the case testified she saw Harbst driving a utility task vehicle used for transporting items while outside the home,\n\nShe said that he was wearing a Superman T-shirt, and saw him drive around the house to where her car was parked.\n\nThe victim later saw the UTV under the back porch of the home.\n\nHer testimony indicated she then heard noises in the basement of the home where a fire was also set.\n\nAfter the fires were started, she saw Harbst with a rifle.\n\nPolice also found a lighter on Harbst’s possession, noted he smelled of gasoline, and that he was “clammy and sweaty” when arrested.\n\nPolice also noted the Superman T-shirt Harbst was wearing.\n\nAt the scene, investigators discovered an empty gas can.\n\nThree additional gas cans were found in the UTV.\n\nA note was found in the UTV that linked Harbst to the victim.\n\nIt was also pointed out that the victim had a protection from abuse order against Harbst.\n\nThe note stated, “Thank You Judge …” referring to the judge who had issued the PFA, not the trial judge.\n\nThe Superior Court panel in its Tuesday opinion concluded that while no one saw Harbst setting the fires, the evidence was enough to convict him.\n\nHe did however admit to writing the letter found in the UTV.\n\nThe opinion pointed out that in the three months prior to the incident Harbst, who was known as a “gentle, generous, family-focused” man who rarely said an angry word, was experiencing a breakdown."
