        "text": "DACULA, Ga. (WANF/Gray News) – A USPS mail carrier accused of stealing and dumping mail in Georgia has been arrested.\n\nThe Gwinnett County Police Department said USPS contacted them last week about a mail carrier named Marcus Gregory.\n\nUSPS said several complaints were filed about people not receiving their mail on Gregory’s route.\n\nPolice launched an investigation and said undercover officers followed Gregory while he was working. They witnessed him dump mail in the woods and saw him use illegal drugs in his mail truck, police said.\n\n“He was delivering the mail to one house, he would skip over a bunch of houses, deliver a little bit more mail to another house and then skip over a whole lot more houses,” said Sgt. Collin Flynn with Gwinnett County police. “Until he eventually just walked out of the vehicle, walked over to a wood line and dumped a bunch of mail in the woods.”\n\nOfficers pulled Gregory over and placed him under arrest.\n\nDuring a search of his mail truck, officers said they found more illegal drugs and a handgun.\n\nGregory’s personal vehicle was also searched, where officers found an additional 215 pieces of stolen mail inside, the department said.\n\nOn Saturday, officers said they searched Gregory’s home and located even more stolen mail.\n\nGregory is facing more than 50 felony charges in the case, including DUI drugs, possession of a Schedule I narcotic, possession of a firearm during a crime, theft of stolen mail, and theft by taking and obstruction."
