        "text": "PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Gray News) - A father on vacation with his family in Florida died after being hit by a car while he was protecting his loved ones, according to his family.\n\nTroopers with the Florida Highway Patrol said the crash took place just after 9 p.m. Friday night.\n\nThey said a group of people were walking across Front Beach Road west of Kelly Road outside of a marked crosswalk. In this group were 29-year-old Thomas Lyon and his family.\n\nAs the group crossed, a 2024 Nissan Altima was speeding in one of the eastbound lanes of Front Beach Road, WJHG reported.\n\nAs the car passed, it hit and killed one of the pedestrians, who was later identified as Lyon.\n\nTroopers took 39-year-old Casey Austin Rattan into custody.\n\nInvestigators said Rattan, of Panama City Beach, was found to be under the influence and was taken into custody on charges of driving under the influence manslaughter and vehicular homicide.\n\nOfficials said the family of Lyon, who was from Brumley, Missouri, has been notified.\n\nAuthorities are continuing to investigate the accident.\n\nLoved ones of Lyon created a GoFundMe to help pay for his funeral expenses.\n\n“To know Thomas was to love him. He just had that personality, he would do anything to help anyone and loved fiercely,” the GoFundMe post reads. “His girls are what made his world go round.”\n\nAccording to Lake Expo News, Lyon and his wife had just celebrated their first wedding anniversary on July 31 at the same location where they had been wed.\n\nThey also had just found out they were expecting their third child.\n\n“Thomas will never get the chance to meet their unborn baby due to a selfish, senseless man who took everything from him and us,” the GoFundMe post said. “We want to do everything in our power to make sure that the man who did this gets everything that’s coming and then some.”\n\nLyon was the sole provider of the family, and any extra funds from the GoFundMe will be used to help support the family.\n\nLoved ones said the money would be used to pay for Lyon’s funeral expenses, as well as lawyer fees and to help cover bills for the family.\n\n“The last thing a widow and her children need to worry about is how to bury their loved one and get the justice that Thomas deserves,” the post said. “We are eternally grateful for the outpouring of love and support. Please keep the Lyon family in your prayers!”\n\nAs of Thursday, the GoFundMe has raised more than $36,000 of its original $9,000 goal."
