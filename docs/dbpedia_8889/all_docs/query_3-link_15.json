Dogs may be taken by leash out to the front where our adoption viewing pens are located. There you will be able to interact with the dog before making your decision to adopt. Cats may be handled inside the cattery, with doors closed of course, to enjoy the cat snuggled up in your arms.\n\nMaintaining our kennels and cattery is a continuous process. The runs and cages are cleaned and disinfected each day, and all the animals are fed before the doors open for public view. The kennel runs and cat cages are cleaned throughout the entire day to keep our animals healthy and living in a suitable and clean environment.\n\nOur animals are cared for in this manner seven days a week including holidays. A day does not go by without attention given to our animal population. Equally as important, virtually everyday an animal is brought into the shelter, subsequently the population changes somewhat daily.\n\nIf you’re interested in helping out our shelter with supplies, please check out our Amazon Wishlist: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2IB5F719KWJZN?ref_=wl_share\n\nField Service\n\nAnimal Control Officers respond to a variety of calls for service. Officers enforce municipal codes as well as State and Federal laws pertaining to animals. Officers handle a variety of both domestic and wild animals. They patrol our city streets looking for dogs running at large, dead animals, injured animals, and aggressive animals. In addition, they handle reports dealing with animal cruelty or neglect, animal welfare concerns, animals in distress, noisy animals and animal attacks. Officers also have the ability to issue citations and assist in investigations.\n\nAdoptions\n\nYou may choose to adopt from a large population of animals from our shelter. All animals adopted that are two (2) months of age or older are sent out to a veterinary hospital to be surgically altered prior to the new owner taking possession of the new pet. The new pet owner then goes directly to the animal hospital to collect their animal and no additional fees are owed unless they make prior arrangements for additional services. The City of Redlands pays any cost above the deposit paid by the adopter to cover the total cost of the surgery. You may choose to pay by cash, check, credit card or debit card for your adoption.\n\nView Animals Available for Adoption or Lost and Found Pets\n\nhttps://24petconnect.com/\n\nAdoption fees for dogs\n\nAll dogs regardless of age adopt out at the following rate\n\nAdoption\n\n$15\n\nVaccination\n\n$30\n\nSpay/Neuter deposit\n\n$85\n\nMicrochip\n\n$25\n\nTotal Cost for Adoption $155 Senior Citizen (55+) Cost $110 Military (with ID) Cost $135\n\nAdoption fees for cats\n\nAll cats regardless of age adopt out at the following rate\n\nAdoption\n\n$10\n\nVaccination\n\n$15\n\nSpay/Neuter deposit\n\n$55\n\nMicrochip\n\n$25\n\nTotal Cost for Adoption $105 Senior Citizen (55+) Cost $85 Military (with ID) Cost $100\n\nReclaims\n\nIf your pet should happen to be impounded at the shelter, unfortunately there will be fees associated with the reclaim of your animal.

Phone: 909-798-7544\n\nMailing Address: City of Redlands, Revenue Division, PO Box 3005, Redlands, CA 92373.\n\nDog License Application – Single\n\nDog License Application – Multiple\n\nIf you reside inside the City limits and own a dog, you must secure a City dog license for your pet per Municipal Code 6.04.020. Your dog is required by law to be licensed by four (4) months of age, within 30 days of moving to the City or within 30 days of acquiring a dog.\n\nYou must obtain a State approved rabies vaccination for your dog that must be administered by a licensed veterinarian. The vet will provide you with a rabies certificate. This certificate must be presented to the Revenue Division office as proof of vaccination when you purchase your dog’s license.\n\nThe first vaccination will be good for a 12-month period. The license will also be good for one year. When the dog is re-vaccinated, the vaccine will protect your pet for a three-year period per Municipal Code 6.04.140.\n\nA City license must be purchased yearly. The license fee for a one-year period is $32 for unaltered and $20.00 for altered as long as presented within the 30-day period; otherwise, penalties will apply per Municipal code 6.04.090. In order to obtain the altered rate, the certificate of alteration/sterilization must be presented to the Revenue Division. For replacement dog tags, due to lost or stolen, a replacement fee of $23.00 will be required.\n\nYour rabies vaccination protects your pet against the deadly rabies virus. The State of California is still considered a rabies state. The City of Redlands has had ten (10) bats test positive in a three-year period. This is reason enough to abide by vaccination laws. Your City license assists in providing proof of vaccination and is a great way for shelter staff to identify your animal should your dog be impounded. Shelter staff will be able to trace the license number directly to you and will be able to notify you immediately that your dog has been picked up. You then can be reunited with your animal quickly.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhere are you located?\n\nThe shelter is located at 504 N. Kansas Street (on the corner of Park and Kansas).
