        "text": "Paths of Possession is a melodic death metal band from Tampa, Florida, United states. Formed in 1999 as Swollen, the band is a solid mix of traditional heavy metal with influences of Swedish melodic death metal. The band independently released their first CD-r demo, Legacy in Ashes, in 2000. Soon after, they was approached by Keith Suchland better known as “Splattergod” about releasing their next CD. It was mutually decided that they and Dark Faith would release a split EP, with each band contributing six songs.\n\nAs their then vocalist, Bill, had relocated to New York, Buttman asked his friend, George “Corpsegrinder” Fisher (vocalist of Cannibal Corpse) to take over the vocal position. The result was entitled The Crypt of Madness and released on Splattergod Records, limited to 1000 copies. Plans were then made between the band and Splattergod to release their full length CD in late 2004 / early 2005. Now it features George “Corpsegrinder” Fisher in a more melodic environment, with song structures that have much more in common with early Bay Area Thrash than the Tampa death metal scene.\n\nOther Information\n\nOrigin: Tampa, Florida, United States\n\nGenres: Melodic death metal, Death metal\n\nYears active: 1999–present\n\nLabels: Metal Blade Records\n\nAssociated acts: Cannibal Corpse, Monstrosity, Silhaven, Lunar Reign, Dark Faith\n\nWebsite: http://www.pathsofpossession.com\n\nMembers:\n\nGeorge “Corpsegrinder” Fisher – vocals\n\nJay Fossen – guitar\n\nJack Goodwin – guitar\n\nRandy Butman – bass\n\nNick Goodyear – drums\n\nVideos\n\nAlbums\n\nLegacy in Ashes (2002)\n\nThe Crypt of Madness (2003) – Split\n\nPromises in Blood (2005)\n\nThe End of the Hour (2007)\n\nLinks\n\nPaths of Possession – Official Site\n\nPaths of Possession – MySpace\n\nPaths of Possession – Metal Blade Records\n\nPaths of Possession – Wikipedia"
