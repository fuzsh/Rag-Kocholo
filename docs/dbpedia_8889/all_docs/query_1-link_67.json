        "text": "Navigating the Path to a Green Card through Marriage to a U.S. Citizen\n\nNavigating the journey towards obtaining a U.S. Green Card through marriage can be a complex and intricate process. As an experienced immigration attorney at Zavala Texas Law , our aim is to simplify and clarify this pathway. This blog post provides an overview of what a Green Card is and the steps involved in securing it through marriage to a United States citizen.\n\nWhat is a Green Card?\n\nA Green Card, officially known as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document that grants an individual the legal right to live and work permanently in the United States. It is a crucial step for those seeking to make the U.S. their long-term home and can be a pathway to U.S. citizenship.\n\nEligibility for a Green Card through Marriage\n\nTo be eligible for a Green Card through marriage, you must be legally married to a U.S. citizen. This includes same-sex marriages. The marriage must be bona fide, meaning it is genuine and not entered into just for the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits.\n\nStep-by-Step Process\n\nFiling a Petition: The U.S. citizen spouse must file Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This form establishes the marital relationship.\n\nAdjustment of Status or Consular Processing: If the foreign spouse is already in the U.S., they can file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. If outside the U.S., they will undergo consular processing in their home country.\n\nBiometrics Appointment: The foreign spouse may need to attend a biometrics appointment for fingerprinting and photographing.\n\nInterview: Both spouses typically attend an interview with a USCIS officer to confirm the marriage’s authenticity.\n\nGreen Card Approval: If the application is approved, the foreign spouse will receive a Green Card, valid for two years if the marriage is less than two years old, or ten years if the marriage is older.\n\nImportant Considerations\n\nEvidence of a Genuine Marriage: Applicants must provide evidence of a genuine marriage, such as joint bank statements, lease agreements, or photographs together.\n\nFinancial Support: The U.S. citizen spouse must file an Affidavit of Support, proving they can financially support their spouse.\n\nLegal Challenges: It’s essential to navigate legal complexities, such as immigration status or prior visa violations, which can impact the process.\n\nWhy Choose Zavala Texas Law? At Zavala Texas Law, we specialize in helping couples navigate the complexities of immigration law. Our experienced attorneys provide personalized guidance and support throughout the Green Card process, ensuring all legal requirements are met efficiently and effectively."
