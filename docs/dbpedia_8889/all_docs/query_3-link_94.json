        "text": "ARCATA – On Dec. 7, 2023, a Humboldt County jury found 25-year-old Gregory N. Mattox guilty of voluntary manslaughter of 36-year-old Joshua Gephart, as well as being a felon in possession of a firearm, and providing false information to law enforcement with the intent to evade justice.\n\nOn July 31, the Honorable Judge Cockrum sentenced Mattox to serve 21 years and 8 months in prison for his crimes.\n\nDuring the morning hours of July 2, 2023, Mattox shot and killed Gephart after the two briefly interacted outside the front gate of a business on Boyd Road in Arcata.\n\nMattox fled the scene on a bicycle. Detective Victoria Johnson of the Arcata Police Department led the criminal investigation into Gephart’s death, with the assistance of many others, including APD Evidence Technician Taron Brown, and local businesses who provided video surveillance, which proved critical to identifying Mattox as the shooter.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Candace Myers, with the assistance of District Attorney Investigator Greg Hill and Victim Witness Advocate Michala Pelren, prosecuted Mattox. Local defense attorney Paul Gallegos represented the defendant.\n\nDistrict Attorney Stacey Eads stated,“ I am grateful to the members of the jury for their service, and truly hope the aggravated prison sentence imposed by Judge Cockrum today provides at least some degree of closure for Mr. Gephart’s loved ones.”"
