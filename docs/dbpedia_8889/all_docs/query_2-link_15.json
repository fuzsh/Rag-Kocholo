        "text": "EVERETT, Mass. (TMX) -- A Massachusetts man was arrested Tuesday night after allegedly stealing $13,000 worth of chips from a gaming table at the Encore Boston Harbor casino in Everett, authorities said.\n\nMassachusetts State Police said they were contacted by Encore Boston Harbor’s Security Control Center at around 6 p.m., and they reported that a patron grabbed a stack of chips from a dealer tray at a table game and fled the premises.\n\nWitnesses said the suspect, later identified as 35-year-old Gary Hunt, was at the table but not playing the game, and got up multiple times to use his phone. When he returned to the table, he allegedly announced that someone had won a large sum of money, which distracted the other patrons at the table.\n\nWhile the other patrons were distracted, police say Hunt reached over the table and stole 13 orange chips worth $1,000 each from the dealer’s tray and fled out the emergency exit.\n\nHunt’s description was relayed to nearby officers, including local Everett Police, and he was quickly located in a nearby parking lot.\n\nWhen Hunt was arrested, he was allegedly found to be in possession of “several” orange chips, but not all 13. Police say security video revealed Hunt had allegedly dropped a chip while fleeing the casino, and discarded another two chips outside the casino.\n\nHunt was charged with larceny over $1,200 and larceny from a building."
