        "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT/Gray News) - A student in Tennessee has been critically injured after being hit by a car while she was waiting for her school bus.\n\nAccording to the Knox County Sheriff’s Office, a female student was struck by a vehicle while she was at a school bus stop Thursday morning.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with this student and her family. We can’t emphasize enough how important it is that drivers take care in the early morning and afternoon when students are walking to and from bus stops,” said Knox County Schools Superintendent Dr. Jon Rysewyk.\n\nKnox County authorities said the crash that turned into a hit-and-run occurred around 7:30 a.m. at the intersection of Thorton and Hughlan drives.\n\n“A passerby noticed the female lying on the ground at about the same time the school bus arrived,” Kimberly Glenn, with Knox County Schools, said. “The victim was taken to the University of Tennessee Medical Center.”\n\nThe girl, who is a minor, suffered critical injuries in the collision and remains hospitalized, according to school officials.\n\nThursday was also the school district’s first day of school.\n\n“I want to call on the entire community to aid us this year in keeping students safe during their commute to and from school,” Rysewyk said.\n\nThe Knox County Sheriff’s Office urged anyone with further information to contact them at 865-215-2243."
