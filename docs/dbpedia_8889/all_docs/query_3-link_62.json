        "text": "Claire Hammill scored twice as the Rocks won their first district championship in 25 years.\n\nLikely no girls soccer team in Michigan was as motivated on Saturday as Salem, which blanked Kensington Lakes Activities Association champion Livonia Stevenson 3-0 to win its first Division 1 district title since 1999.\n\nSince Kyle Karns took over as coach eight years ago, the Rocks (13-5-5) have lost in the district final five times, which is saying something because that also counts the 2020 season canceled because of the pandemic. So, essentially, they are 5 of 7 making it to district championships in that time span.\n\nEvery single loss but one has been by one goal, including losing in overtime to rival Canton twice.\n\nSo you don't need to tell this year's senior class what breaking a 25-year drought means. The past three seasons, with trophies on the line, they've seen their seasons end 2-1 to Canton in 2001, 1-0 to state runner-up Northville in 2002 and 3-0 to the Chiefs, once again, last year.\n\nThey're excited to face Ann Arbor Skyline in Tuesday's regional semifinal.\n\nMore: KLAA champions! Livonia Stevenson girls soccer's tough defense edges Hartland, 1-0\n\n\"It's hard to win with the districts we normally get,\" said Karns, who took Salem's boys team to the state semifinal in 2019 and 2022. \"Playing our Park teams (Plymouth-Canton Educational Park rivals Canton and Plymouth) for the third time in a season is always tough, and Stevenson has been playing great all year. So it's never an easy road. We've been on the other side of this game a lot, despite making quite a few finals. But we haven't been able to get over that hump, so it feels good to be on this side of it.\"\n\nIt's also hard to get through the KLAA-West, which usually includes two or three teams ranked in the top 10 of the Michigan High School Soccer Coaches Association polls every season. Like, hello, the division includes state powers Northville and Novi, among others.\n\nThey actually beat division champion Hartland 2-1 in the season opener, but tying five other league opponents ultimately cost them a chance at earning a berth in the KLAA championship game on May 16.\n\nSo it was the Eagles representing the West against East champion Stevenson, which got a penalty kick from Tiffin University signee Kelsey Ware to win its first league title under coach Ken Shingledecker over Hartland.\n\nMissing out on a chance to play Stevenson in the KLAA championship definitely motivated the Rocks, who scored twice in the opening eight minutes of play against the host Spartans, in the district final.\n\n\"We beat Hartland at the beginning of the season, so not being able to end our regular season how we wanted to, we were just happy we got a whole new run at it at (in the postseason),\" said senior Lauren Driscoll, who toed in a corner kick from Cali Schwartzenberger 3 yards out to put Salem ahead 2-0 early. \"It just means so much because we've worked so hard for it this season, and I think we deserve it.\"\n\nTo be fair, we might not have gotten Stevenson's best showing.\n\nFor one, Stevenson High School held its graduation the night before, so there was the excitement that came with 12 Spartans walking across the stage to receive their diploma.\n\nMore: 'Emma is a star:' Johnson, Plymouth girls soccer fight back against rival Salem\n\nAnd, for two, there was the all-night senior party afterward. While the soccer players weren't up all night, it's safe to say the Spartans were a step slower against Salem.\n\nSo it wasn't surprising to see the Rocks win most 50-50 balls and drum up several scoring opportunities. They controlled the possession for about 80% of the match.\n\nSalem played more relaxed and in control and, in turn, they're the district champions because of it.\n\n\"It really just was playing how we play and not getting stuck on how they're playing and what they've been doing,\" said senior Claire Hammill, who scored twice. \"It was more about sticking to what we do as a team and not being rattled by any situations.\""
