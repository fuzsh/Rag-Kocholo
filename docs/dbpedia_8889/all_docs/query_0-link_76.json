        "text": "The Import Permit Program (IPP) uses a secure electronic information system, eIPP, to conduct all program business. This two-way portal, accessible by both the program and those seeking import permits, is used to submit and share information. As of September 2018, the only way to apply for a CDC import permit is by using this system. Additional information can be found here.\n\nAll potential applicants are required to have a SAMS (Secure Access Management Services) account – which protects the security of the information by requiring users to enter a user ID and password, or other secure credentials, before providing access to the system – in order to access the eIPP system to apply for a permit. If you do not yet have a SAMS account but would like to establish one in order to submit a new application, please contact us.\n\nOnly applications submitted via eIPP will be accepted.\n\nIf your facility will receive multiple agents, select “Add Infectious Biological Agent & Add Template” to include the scientific name of all known/suspected infectious biological agents in Section D, items #5-11. Currently, there are no limits on the number of agents/vectors that can be entered.\n\n“Infectious biological agent” is defined as a microorganism [including, but not limited to, bacteria (including rickettsiae), viruses, fungi, or protozoa] or prion, whether naturally occurring, bioengineered, or artificial, or a component of such microorganism or prion that is capable of causing communicable disease in a human.\n\nYes. The novel H7N9 Influenza A virus has caused infections in both humans and birds. APHIS and CDC have authority over the importation of all microorganisms which cause, or have the potential, to cause disease in animals or humans respectively, and so both agencies will issue permits for the novel H7N9 influenza A virus. For further information, please contact APHIS at 301-851-3300 (Option 1) or CDC at 404-718-2077.\n\nCDC will not issue a permit for Asian lineage H7N9 low path avian influenza until a USDA/APHIS permit has been obtained. Please see https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/organisms_and_vectors/newasian-lineage-h7n9-requirements.pdf for more information. Please upload a copy of your approved USDA/APHIS permit into eIPP.\n\nInfectious biological agent – A microorganism [including, but not limited to, bacteria (including rickettsiae), viruses, fungi, or protozoa] or prion, whether naturally occurring, bioengineered, or artificial, or a component of such microorganism or prion that is capable of causing communicable disease in a human.\n\nInfectious substance – Any material that is known or reasonably expected to contain an infectious biological agent.\n\nVector – Any animals (vertebrate or invertebrate) including arthropods or any noninfectious self-replicating system (e.g., plasmids or other molecular vector) or animal products (e.g., a mount, rug, or other display item composed of the hide, hair, skull, teeth, bones, or claws of an animal) that are known to transfer or are capable of transferring an infectious biological agent to a human.\n\nAnimals – Any member of the animal kingdom except a human including an animal product (e.g., a mount, rug, or other display item composed of the hide, hair, skull, teeth, bones, or claws).\n\nArthropods – Any living insect including crustaceans, spiders, scorpions, etc. capable of being a host or vector of human disease.\n\nSnails – Any freshwater snails (phylum Mollusca, class Gastropoda) capable of transmitting schistosomiasis.\n\nBats – All live bats. See below for further information on obtaining an import permit for live bats. Bats may also require a permit from the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service. For additional information, see https://www.fws.gov/permits/?ref=topbar.\n\nNon-human primate material – All non-human primate material (e.g. blood, plasma, tissue, urine, feces) requires an import permit, unless it has been specifically treated and rendered non-infectious.\n\nPlease note that the described material may require a permit from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) or be prohibited from importation under the USDA regulations. Information on USDA transport or import permits is available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/importexport.\n\nIn most cases, an import permit may not be required. Diagnostic specimens that are not known by the importer to contain, or suspected by the importer of containing, an infectious biological agent and is accompanied by an importer certification statement confirming that the material is not known to contain or suspected of containing an infectious biological agent, or has been rendered noninfectious would not require a CDC import permit.\n\nIt depends. Nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any infectious biological agent would require a CDC import permit. For example, viral genomes which consist of positive sense RNA are infectious when the purified viral RNA is applied to permissive cells in the absence of any viral proteins. In some cases, viral genomes which are composed of double-stranded DNA are also infectious [e.g., genome of Cercopithecine Herpesvirus 1 (Herpes B virus)].\n\nNucleic acids that cannot produce infectious forms of any infectious biological agent and are accompanied by an importer certification statement confirming that the material is not known to contain or suspected of containing an infectious biological agent would not require a CDC import permit.\n\nYes. Any sample known, or suspected by the importer of containing, an infectious biological agent would require a CDC import permit. This product would not meet the exemption because the product is not approved or cleared by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.).\n\nHowever, if the material is not known to contain or suspected of containing an infectious biological agent, or has been rendered noninfectious, it would not require a CDC import permit. The material must be accompanied by an importer certification statement confirming that the material is not known to contain or suspected of containing an infectious biological agent, or has been rendered noninfectious.\n\nA permit to import, or receive through subsequent transfer, is valid only for the time period indicated on the issued permit. The issuance and expiration dates located on the import permit pertain only to the dates that the importer is allowed to import into the United States the infectious biological agents, infectious substances, and vectors listed on the import permit. The conditions for importation and continued possession listed on the permit remain in effect until the importer is no longer in possession of the imported material.\n\nPlease note that all requests for renewal of an existing import permit require the submission of a new application and current signature of the permittee. To prevent lapses in the import permit status, it is recommended that permit renewal applications be submitted at least 30 days prior to the expiration date on the current permit.\n\nNo. The issuance of an import permit is not an authorization to hand carry the imported material into the United States. The shipment of infectious biological agents, infectious substances, or vectors of human disease into the United States must be packaged, labeled, and shipped in accordance with all federal and international regulations. When traveling by air, the biological materials must be declared to the airline and cannot be concealed in checked luggage. Contact the airline and U.S. Customs in advance to ensure compliance with their policies and procedures.\n\nNo person may carry a hazardous material in the cabin of a passenger-carrying aircraft or on the flight deck of any aircraft, and the hazardous material must be located in a place that is inaccessible to persons other than crew members. Hazardous materials may be carried in a main deck cargo compartment of a passenger aircraft provided that the compartment is inaccessible to passengers and that it meets all certification requirements for a Class B aircraft cargo compartment in 14 CFR 25.857(b) or for a Class C aircraft cargo compartment in 14 CFR 25.857(c).\n\nThe facility should use a scientifically supportable method. The method used to cause permanent loss of biological activity must be reliable and based on the agent’s sensitivity to the inactivating method. An acceptable method may consist of traditional methods that have been generally recognized in the scientific community and published in the scientific literature or a method developed in-house, but that method should be validated as applied. While there is no requirement to notify CDC prior to rendering an agent non-infectious, the facility should incorporate a practice of maintaining records on file in support of materials being non-infectious.\n\nAn applicant who wishes to make an appeal would have 30 calendar days after receiving the denial to submit the appeal in writing to the CDC Director. The appeal must state the factual basis for the appeal and provide any supporting documentations to justify the appeal (e.g., documents that demonstrate the facility has the appropriate biosafety measures in place for working safely with the requested imported material). CDC will issue a written response, which would constitute final agency action.\n\nThe applicant can submit the appeal to the CDC Director through the CDC Import Permit Program by email (importpermit@cdc.gov), fax [(404) 718-2093] or mail:\n\nCDC Import Permit Program\n\n1600 Clifton Rd, Mailstop A-46\n\nAtlanta, GA 30329\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is not a select agent identified in the select agent regulations. Therefore, the possession, use and transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is not regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP).\n\nOn February 11, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced that taxonomically, what has previously been referred to as 2019-nCoV should now be referred to as SARS-CoV-2. The “Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: The species and its viruses – a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group” https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862v1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is not a descendent of SARS-CoV (a select agent), but is genetically closely related.\n\nThe select agent regulations currently govern the possession, use and transfer of viruses identified as SARS-CoV, not viruses identified as SARS-CoV-2. The positive strand RNA genome of SARS-COV is also a select agent because this genomic material represents nucleic acids capable of generating infectious virus.\n\nAs the Federal Select Agent Program gains more information about the SARS-CoV-2, we will reassess the select agent status as needed. Any changes in the select agent status of SARS-CoV-2 will be published in the Federal Register.\n\nYes. CDC limits the importation of bats under the authority of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 264) based on the significant public health risks associated with bats. Specifically, bats are known carriers of infectious biological agents that cause communicable and other diseases in humans. The most significant of these infectious biological agents are Nipah virus and viruses that cause communicable diseases such as Ebola, Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever, Sudden Acute Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and rabies.\n\nIf the bat is a native species of the United States, no permit is required to transfer the live bats. However, the CDC Import Permit Program requires a permit for the transfer of live bats within the United States if the bat was previously imported from outside of the United States. This requirement is listed as a condition indicated on the issued permit. To initiate the process for a permit, the facility would need to submit the “Application for Permit to Import or Transport Live Bats” through eIPP.\n\nThe Import Permit Program (IPP) uses a secure electronic information system, eIPP, to conduct all program business. This two-way portal, accessible by both the program and those seeking import permits, is used to submit and share information. As of September 2018, the only way to apply for a CDC import permit is by using this system. Additional information can be found here.\n\nAll potential applicants are required to have a SAMS (Secure Access Management Services) account – which protects the security of the information by requiring users to enter a user ID and password, or other secure credentials, before providing access to the system – in order to access the eIPP system to apply for a permit. If you do not yet have a SAMS account but would like to establish one in order to submit a new application, please contact us.\n\nOnly applications submitted via eIPP will be accepted.\n\nRequirements for All Infectious Substances\n\nThe DOT regulations (49 CFR 171.15 and 171.16) require each person in physical possession of a hazardous material, including an infectious substance, to report specific types of transportation incidents that involve these materials. Immediate reporting by telephone to the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802 is required for incidents where fire, breakage, spillage, or suspected contamination occurs that involves the shipment of infectious substances other than a patient specimen or regulated medical waste (See 49 CFR 171.15(b)(3)). In addition, a written report to DOT is required within 30 days of the discovery of the incident for any unintentional release of hazardous material from a packaging during transportation, including those covered under 49 CFR 171.15 (See 49 CFR 171.16(a)). DOT regulations also require packages that contain infectious substances to be accompanied by several forms of hazard communication, as applicable, as well as labeled to indicate the infectious hazard (See 49 CFR 172.432 for a depiction of the required label). This label currently includes a statement for reporting a damaged package.\n\nImported infectious biological agents, infectious substances, and vectors classified as a Category A infectious substance must be packaged in accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s) Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180), and be accompanied by a shipping paper, marking, labeling, and note the appropriate emergency response information. Please see the Guidance for Completing the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods for more information.\n\nLabeling of Packages\n\nThe outer container of all Category A infectious substance packages must display the following:\n\nSender’s name and address\n\nRecipient’s name and address\n\nInfectious substance label\n\nProper shipping name, UN number, and net quantity of infectious substance\n\nName and telephone number of person responsible for shipment\n\nCargo Aircraft Only label (when shipping quantities of infectious substance over 50 ml or 50 g by aircraft)\n\nClass 9 label, including UN 1845, and net weight if packaged with dry ice and identified as Carbon Dioxide, solid, or Dry ice"
