        "text": "American death metal vocalist\n\nThis article is about the vocalist. For other people, see George Fisher.\n\nMusical artist\n\nGeorge Fisher (born July 8, 1970),[1] better known by his stage name Corpsegrinder, is an American death metal vocalist who is the lead singer of Cannibal Corpse, Paths of Possession and the supergroup Serpentine Dominion.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1991, Fisher made his first official studio appearance on Suffocation's Effigy of the Forgotten. His vocals can be heard on the songs \"Mass Obliteration\" and \"Reincremation\".\n\nFisher recorded two albums with Florida's Monstrosity before leaving and joining Cannibal Corpse in late 1995, replacing vocalist Chris Barnes.\n\nFisher has also provided guest vocals for California deathcore band Suicide Silence on the song \"Control\" from their fourth album, You Can't Stop Me. Fisher also performed guest vocals on Job for a Cowboy's 2014 album Sun Eater on the song \"The Synthetic Sea.\" In 2021, Fisher performed guest vocals for Boston metalcore band Ice Nine Kills on the song \"Take Your Pick\" from the band's album The Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood.\n\nFisher does occasional guest appearances in the animated series Metalocalypse where he voices the Metal Masked Assassin. He was also the inspiration for the character Nathan Explosion, the lead vocalist for Dethklok, who has a similar physical appearance and performance style to Corpsegrinder.\n\nFisher released his debut solo album, Corpsegrinder, on February 25, 2022.[2]\n\nSinging style and appearance\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a death metal vocalist, Fisher employs the \"death growl\" extended vocal technique. Fisher has also gained much popularity through the size of his neck. He has explained multiple times that the size of his neck is due to a combination of headbanging and lifting weights when he was younger.\n\nPersonal life and interests\n\n[edit]\n\nFisher was born in Baltimore, Maryland.[3] He is married and has two daughters. Prior to joining Cannibal Corpse, Fisher worked as a driller's assistant in the Baltimore area.\n\nFisher is a fan of metal bands such as Death, Slayer, Morbid Angel, Napalm Death, Sodom, Dark Angel, Judas Priest, Dethklok, Black Sabbath, Motörhead, Autopsy, Deicide, Dio, Mercyful Fate, Kreator, Megadeth, Iron Maiden and Metallica.[4][5][6] He said, \"I am a fan of live records. Unleashed in the East by Judas Priest is probably one of the all-time greatest live records ever put out. I also like the Sodom live disc they put out a while ago, and of course Iron Maiden's classic Live After Death. I also think the live Deicide disc When Satan Lives is great too. Glen Benton's vocals are so powerful.\"[7] \"I listen to a lot of straight edge stuff, you know, from the eighties.\"[6] He is a fan of the Washington Wizards and the Denver Broncos.[8][9] Fisher is apolitical and has never voted in an election;[10] however, he expressed support to NFL players taking the knee.[11]\n\nFisher is a noted fan of the online role-playing game World of Warcraft; he has a tattoo representing the Horde, one of the factions in the game, on his right forearm and added the phrase \"Fuck the Alliance\" to the liner notes of the 2006 Cannibal Corpse album Kill.[12][13] He also made an appearance at BlizzCon 2011 where he performed alongside Level 90 Elite Tauren Chieftain, a band made up of Blizzard Entertainment employees. Fisher was referenced in the game when Blizzard inserted a non-player character named \"Gorge the Corpsegrinder\" into the Wrath of the Lich King expansion in 2008, who was later renamed to \"Annihilator Grek'lor\" in 2021 after allegedly homophobic remarks about the Alliance faction by Fisher reemerged.[14]\n\nContrary to the subject matter of his music, Fisher's personal life, viewed largely through his Instagram page, has been noted to be \"wholesome\",[15] showing him as a father with his children at Walt Disney World and with large plush toys; he himself has noted an affinity towards winning plush animals from claw machine games, which he then often donates to charity.[16]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nCorpsegrinder\n\nCorpsegrinder (2022)\n\nCannibal Corpse\n\nVile (1996)\n\nGallery of Suicide (1998)\n\nBloodthirst (1999)\n\nGore Obsessed (2002)\n\nThe Wretched Spawn (2004)\n\nKill (2006)\n\nEvisceration Plague (2009)\n\nTorture (2012)\n\nA Skeletal Domain (2014)\n\nRed Before Black (2017)\n\nViolence Unimagined (2021)\n\nChaos Horrific (2023)\n\nMonstrosity\n\nImperial Doom (1992)\n\nMillennium (1996)\n\nPaths of Possession\n\nThe Crypt of Madness (2003)\n\nPromises in Blood (2005)\n\nThe End of the Hour (2007)\n\nVoodoo Gods\n\nAnticipation for Blood Leveled in Darkness (2014)\n\nThe Divinity of Blood (2020)\n\nSerpentine Dominion\n\nSerpentine Dominion (2016)\n\nDethklok\n\nThe Doomstar Requiem (2013) – voice of Metal Masked Assassin\n\nSuicide Silence\n\nYou Can't Stop Me (2014) – guest vocals on track \"Control\"\n\nJob for a Cowboy\n\nSun Eater (2014) – guest vocals on track \"The Synthetic Sea\"\n\nSuffocation\n\nEffigy of the Forgotten (1991) - guest vocals on tracks \"Mass Obliteration\" and \"Reincremation\"\n\nEktomorf\n\nAggressor (2015) - guest vocals on track \"Evil by Nature\"\n\nHeaven Shall Burn\n\nWanderer (2016) - guest vocals on track \"Prey to God\"\n\nTransmetal\n\nMéxico Bárbaro (1996) - guest vocals on tracks \"México Bárbaro\" and \"Ceveline\"\n\nIgorrr\n\nSpirituality and Distortion (2020) - guest vocals on track \"Parpaing\"\n\nDeeds of Flesh\n\nNucleus (2020) - guest vocals on track \"Ethereal Ancestors\"\n\nDee Snider\n\nLeave a Scar (2021) - guest vocals on track \"Time to Choose\"\n\nIce Nine Kills\n\nThe Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood (2021) - guest vocals on track \"Take Your Pick\"[17]\n\nRevocation\n\nNetherheaven (2022) - guest vocals on track \"Re-Crucified\"\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
