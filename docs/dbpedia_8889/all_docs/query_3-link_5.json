Self-proving Wills eliminate the need for witnesses.\n\nDisposition of Property\n\nProperty owned solely in the name of the decedent passes by Will.\n\nProperty owned by the entireties (husband and wife), jointly or in a trust does not pass by Will.\n\nAdvice as to what specific property does or does not pass by Will and what property is or is not subject to Pennsylvania Inheritance Taxes should be obtained from your attorney."
