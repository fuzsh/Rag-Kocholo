        "text": "Directions to athletic facilities\n\nFrom I-81, take exit 26. If travelling south on I-81, turn right at the top of the exit ramp. If travelling north on I-81, turn left at the top of the exit ramp. Campus is less than 1 mile from the interstate. Buses may not travel through the center of campus due to construction. All buses should proceed to the second campus entrance at Itta Bena Road (see below).\n\nThere is a gravel road on the right that is a temporary road for construction traffic only. You will pass this construction entrance BEFORE you get to the main campus entrance. The main entrance to campus has two large stone pillars on either side. Go past this main entrance unless you are going to the tennis courts.\n\nTo get to all athletics venues other than tennis courts--Go PAST the construction road and the first campus entrance which is just past the golf course, proceeding under the RR trestle that is ahead. Continue around the sharp curve to the right and go past Macado’s and the Emory post office. Turn right just past the post office onto Itta Bena Road. The King Center is the first building on the right and the football, baseball and softball facilities are all adjacent to the building.\n\nTo get to the tennis courts--Take the first campus entrance through the stone pillars which is just past the construction entrance and the golf course. Take the first left turn after you enter campus and the tennis courts will be approximately .25 mile on the right.\n\nThe physical address of the King Center is: 12228 Itta Bena Road, Emory VA 24327.\n\nVisiting bus parking\n\nVisiting buses should always enter campus at Itta Bena road. Buses may unload by King Center entrance and should proceed to park beside the power plant which is located directly across from the football/soccer stadium. There is ample room to back the bus beside the power plant across from Brooks Field House.\n\nEmory & Henry has a strict ‘no idling’ policy for buses which will be enforced by Campus Security.\n\nVisiting teams\n\nVisiting staff should contact the E&H coach in advance of the contest to relay estimated time of arrival, or any special needs. E&H will have a Game Manager on duty to meet the visiting team and provide instructions as to locker room accommodations, parking, etc. Visiting football teams may provide four complimentary admissions to each player and coach. A pass list should be provided to the E&H game manager upon arrival at the site.\n\nFor information on Athletic Training, go to: http://gowasps.com/information/athletic_training/Visiting_Team_Letter.pdf\n\nFor information on Sports Information, go to: http://gowasps.com/information/sid/index\n\nImportant Phone Numbers\n\nCampus Security 276-944-6222\n\nKing Center 276-944-6233\n\nDirector of Athletics, Anne Crutchfield 276-944-6674\n\nSports Information, Joe Matthews 276-944-6830\n\nAthletic Training, Melissa Davis 276-944-6786\n\nGeneral parking\n\nFor most athletic events other than football, there is ample parking available near the King Center.

Make sure your player knows to list you on the pass list prior to the game. Pass list additions are not allowed on game day.\n\nTailgating\n\nTailgating is a long-standing tradition at E&H, particularly on football game days. An “alcohol-free” tailgate area is located beside the Institutional Advancement House. There are other tailgate lots on campus where alcohol is permitted. Use of any tailgate lot where alcohol is permitted requires either a day-use fee of $10 per car or an advance reservation for the entire season. Emory & Henry regulations and statutes of the Commonwealth of Virginia regarding drug and alcohol consumption will be strictly enforced. College policy and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia prohibit public intoxication and the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by individuals under the age of 21. Hosts who furnish alcohol to underage individuals may be subject to criminal prosecution and personal civil liability exposure. Anyone found consuming or possessing alcohol younger than 21 years of age is subject to arrest and to charges of underage consumption or possession. Driver’s licenses will be checked. Those under 21 must be accompanied by a parent in order to access the Tailgating Areas where alcohol is permitted. Careful use of small propane grills is allowed.
