        "text": "Definition and Administration\n\nLake Forest College explicitly and emphatically prohibits hazing. A student is responsible for hazing when they take any action and/or creates a situation on or off College premises which may produce mental or physical harm, discomfort, harassment, embarrassment, ridicule, or abuse as part of any activity and/or event related to membership and/or participation in an organization.\n\nSuch activities and situations include but are not limited to paddling in any form, creation of excessive fatigue, physical or psychological shocks, morally degrading and humiliating games and activities, late work sessions that interfere with academic goals, the coerced use of alcohol/other drugs, and any other activities that are not consistent with the guidelines and/or policies of the College.\n\nAdministration\n\nHazing violations will be addressed by the Collegeâ€™s conduct system. In addition to those sanctions included in the conduct system, the Student Affairs staff may administer sanctions that include, but are not limited to, warnings, suspensions, or disbandment of organizations.\n\nExplicit violations of this policy will warrant the consideration of a minimum sanction of suspension for at least one year. This policy acknowledges the role that peer pressure and acceptance play in new member programs.\n\nWith this stated, it is important to understand that consent of a new member to given activity does not necessarily imply that the activity in question is appropriate.\n\nThe following are some examples of hazing divided into three categories: subtle, harassment, and violent. It is impossible to list all possible hazing behaviors because many are context specific. While this is not an all-inclusive list, it provides some common examples of hazing traditions."
