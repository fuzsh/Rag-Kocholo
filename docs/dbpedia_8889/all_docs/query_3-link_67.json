You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nI was called into full-time ministry of The Church of Pentecost when Apostle Dr. Michael Kwabena Ntumy assumed the chairmanship position of the Church and was posted to Kete Krachi, his hometown. Each time he returned home, as the then District Overseer, I became his personal assistant, running errands for him and looking after his welfare.\n\nI am truly distraught to hear about the passing of my bosom kinsman, Apostle Dr. M. K. Ntumy. It is with a somber heart and a reflective mind that I remember the profound legacy he leaves behind. His life was a testament to the values of selflessness, humility, and kindness that he embodied every day.\n\nDr. Ntumy was a close collaborator to all, though a chairman. His visits to Krachi were not merely official trips; they were homecomings filled with warmth and the shared joy of being among his people. There, he was a friend, a mentor, and a beacon of hope for the youth, especially in Osramanae, his native land. He had a down-to-earth persona, never placing himself above others but rather walking alongside them. His selfless nature was evident in his commitment to service, always prioritizing the well-being of the community over his own comfort.\n\nEven though I was like an errand boy to him, he most often called me \"Mr. President\"; he did so not to belittle me but to honour the relationship we shared. In his words were echoes of respect and fondness, recognizing the effort and dedication I brought to his assignments. Sometimes, we had to cruise on the Volta Lake in a canoe to places like Nkomi, Atigagorme, etc., with the family to fraternize over a bank.\n\nHis kindness was not selective; it was a universal language he spoke fluently and with a genuine smile. He treated everyone with the utmost respect, and his heart was always open to those around himâ€”traits that became hallmarks of his leadership.\n\nMoreover, Apostle Dr. Ntumy's kind heart touched the lives of many. He had an innate ability to empathize with others and lend a helping hand whenever needed. Whether it was through his charitable works or his genuine concern for the well-being of the townsfolk, he embodied compassion and generosity in their purest forms. Countless individuals can testify to his acts of kindness and the positive impact he made on their lives.\n\nIn mourning his passing, we do not just remember the respective roles he played so well; rather, we celebrate the man he was. For those of us touched by his life, let us carry forward the torch of his legacy, illuminating our paths with the principles he lived by. Dr. M. K. Ntumy's presence will be deeply missed, but his impact will continue to be felt for generations, especially among the Krachi Nchumuru communities."
