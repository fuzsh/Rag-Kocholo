        "text": "Most drugs are illegal throughout the United States. This includes drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and acid. Other substances like marijuana, prescription painkillers, or prescription amphetamines, are illegal under certain conditions. The legal system is tasked with handling drug-related cases in the United States. Any number of things involving drugs or even alcohol can result in legal action.\n\nSelling illicit substances often results in automatic legal action. Drug distribution of any kind is a serious offense. But getting caught while buying, possessing, or taking drugs often leads to legal action as well. Anyone involved with drugs in any of these manners will likely find themselves at least ticketed, if not arrested. Operating a motor vehicle while under the influence is grounds for severe legal repercussions, too.\n\nThe specific charges a person receives for their drug-related actions depend on a few factors. The type or types of drugs, the amount, the town or state where the person is, and any existence of previous charges all play a role. If ordered to appear in court, sentencing could be as simple as community service or a fine, or as severe as doing time in jail or prison.\n\nUsing jail time as a go-to line of defense against people using drugs isn’t the best way to take on many of these cases. Sure, some who run into substance-related trouble aren’t regular drug or alcohol users. They ended up getting caught in the one-off time they were involved with drugs. This isn’t the case for most people with legal troubles stemming from substance use, though. Most of them have existing substance or alcohol use problems.\n\nRelying on the jail and prison system to handle people with drug problems isn’t the most effective approach. Drug addiction is a deep-seated issue. It’s not easy to stop and people can’t “just quit using,” as some may believe. Drug rehab is a much better alternative to jail time for many people struggling with addiction. Comparing the benefits of rehab vs. jail time is crucial when looking at those in the system for drug offenses.\n\nRelying on the jail and prison system to handle people with drug problems isn’t the most effective approach. Drug addiction is a deep-seated issue. It’s not easy to stop and people can’t “just quit using,” as some may believe. Drug rehab is a much better alternative to jail time for many people struggling with addiction. Comparing the benefits of rehab vs. jail time is crucial when looking at those in the system for drug offenses.\n\nPeople who struggle with substance abuse and addiction are more likely to end up with drug charges. Once someone is charged with a drug-related crime they quickly find themselves wrapped up in the legal system. For some individuals, the cycle of addiction also involves an extensive cycle in the court system. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, 1 out of 5 people incarcerated is doing time for a drug-related offense.\n\nPeople who carry a record have a harder time meeting their basic needs. For example, looking for housing or finding a job often involves a background check. Seeing drug-related criminal charges will likely make a potential landlord or employer hesitate. Someone trying to escape the cycle of addiction and rebuild their\n\nAdditionally, there are very few resources in terms of treatment within the jail and prison systems. People who come into jail under the influence have little access to proper medical attention. They often end up spending the course of their detox period without much medical support for their drug withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThe American Public Health Association revealed that only 11 percent of those struggling with addiction receive treatment while behind bars. If little to nothing is done to address their reason for arrest in the first place, how will that keep them from ending up in jail again?\n\nSending individuals with substance use disorders to jail does little to help them get or stay clean. Jail isn’t the best environment for someone who is trying to quit using drugs. There are still ways to find most drugs behind bars. Most people with addiction problems will simply find their substance of choice while in jail and continue using.\n\nConvicting someone on drug-related charges also leaves them with a criminal record that makes post-lockup life more difficult. Overcoming addiction is challenging enough; adding a record will only make it more difficult to reintegrate into society. Adding more barriers to finding things like employment and housing makes it harder to quit.\n\nJail sentences are more likely to keep people trapped in the cycle of addiction rather than get them out of it. On the other hand, court-ordered treatment programs are another option for those facing drug-related charges. Instead of incarcerating individuals with substance use disorders, sending them to a drug rehab program is a far more effective solution.\n\nDrug rehab programs exist for the sole purpose of helping people separate from drugs and alcohol. Treatment facilities are equipped with the appropriate resources to aid those looking to leave substances behind and develop a new way of life.\n\nIf a person is truly interested in trying to quit using drugs, they’ll make use of their time in an addiction treatment program. Sending them to a rehab facility rather than jail or prison is a more proactive solution. They’ll be surrounded by the support that will set them up on the track to a life of recovery.\n\nAnother reason rehab is a more effective alternative is the difficulty of finding adequate employment upon release. A criminal record deters many employers from offering someone a job. Offering first-time offenders the option to attend treatment rather than spend time in jail reflects better on their record. They’re more likely to find employment after leaving a treatment center rather than an institution like jail or prison.\n\nAdditionally, jails don’t usually provide much of a bridge between time behind bars and reintegrating into the real world. Treatment facilities make a point of helping people transition from the controlled environment of rehab to the chaotic reality of everyday life. Case managers work with clients to provide a clear path to follow after release.\n\nSending individuals to drug rehab is a much more positive approach to rehabilitation than locking them up in a correctional facility. They’re more likely to graduate from an addiction program with life skills that will encourage them to reintegrate into society. Treatment teaches people with substance use disorders about the nature of their addiction. Jail does not.\n\nOffering drug-related offenders the option to attend rehab promotes recovery for those most at risk. Rather than pushing them into a system that will more than likely lock them deeper within a cycle of addiction, rehab will provide them with an effective escape from it.\n\nOffenders can use their time in rehab to lay a solid foundation for long-term recovery. They receive the time, support, and resources that give them an adequate opportunity to learn to live sober. They return to society with the ability to support themselves and their families.\n\nIf those struggling with substance abuse are immediately incarcerated, their chances of getting sober are slim. But if those individuals receive the chance to attend drug rehab, they’ll find themselves on a path to recovery and away from the chains of addiction.\n\nThe best way to avoid the problem of rehab vs. jail time is to seek sobriety before reaching that point.

Through a combination of counseling, therapy, holistic wellness, and sober activities, these facilities show addicts how to live life drug-free.\n\nAre you looking for drug rehab in Pennsylvania?
