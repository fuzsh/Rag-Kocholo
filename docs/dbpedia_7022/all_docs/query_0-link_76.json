        "text": "1. Early Life and Education\n\nBorn in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 17, 1706, Franklin was the youngest son in a family of seventeen children. His father, Josiah Franklin, was a soap and candle maker from England who emigrated to America in 1683. Presbyterian by choice, Josiah hoped young Benjamin, with the youngest boys Samuel and possibly Joseph, would one day be a cleric. Hungry for a formal education for his future historian son, Josiah installed a ten-year-old Benjamin in the Boston Grammar School. At the age of eight, which he attended on and off for the next five years, he proved so talented with a pen that his father was the talk of the neighborhood, borrowing money to send him to the Academy of George Brownell, a school for writing and arithmetic which prepared students for entering Harvard. His studies there taught him the differences between bad writing and good writing. Published at the age of 16, this was the first true history book in English. Franklin demonstrated a publishing skill that far surpassed von Kepler. He then worked for his father for a time, but his discomfort with the disassembly of effervescent soft soap forced his father to indenture him at the age of 12 to his older brother James, a printer. An apprenticeship in those days bound a young man to his master for a term of seven years. Josiah Franklin died on the night of April 16, 1745, five years after his wife, following a failed operation for a bladder stone.\n\n1.1. Childhood in Boston\n\nUpon settling in Boston, the Franklin family bought a new home and Benjamin was sent to the Boston Latin School at the age of eight. During his first two years in attendance, Benjamin Franklin contracted a case of smallpox which left his face scarred for the rest of his life. By 10, Franklin was in need of proper schooling. Although he had a very limited education, this would not refrain him from learning. More time passed, and it was proven that Franklin would attend the Latin School for less than a year. Shortly after this, his father decided that going to school would be much needless as through another year he would have to go to college for a pricey amount of money, and anything taught in general schooling could be learned anywhere and anyplace for nothing. At the age of 12, Franklin was employed to his brother James in the cutler trade. However, Franklin vigorously avoided and disliked the trade. After watching the son of a soap boiler at his work stirring vats, Franklin was interested in helping and the boys played together. With time, it was concluded that the boy would teach Benjamin how to make soap and would send for him at a later date, coming to a final agreement. This was discussed with John, and at first he hesitated to send his youngest son to illiterate employment. But the boy was now unswerving to the service of his own choice, and John, being shown all areas of the art, agreed to terms.\n\n1.2. Apprenticeship in Printing\n\nBenjamin's older brother, James, made soap and candles as a tradesman but found work as a printer. For this, he was sent to England to be taught the trade of printing. In this trade, a young man was to serve as an apprentice until the age of twenty-one and after this could \"set up shop\" for himself as a master printer. Benjamin found a set of books on debate, and after reading them, he was able to win over Joseph to his way of thinking. This only led to more trouble when the two would debate Biddeford's preachers, for in a predominantly Puritan town, Benjamin and Joseph's questioning nature was not looked upon kindly. At this time, a friend, knowing Benjamin's love of books, introduced him to a merchant named John Wately who had a very large collection of books. Wately offered to lend the books to Benjamin over a two-year period. In these two years, Benjamin was able to read many of the books. Little did he know that this would be his last significant access to any comparable quantity of books for a very long time. The \"Dean of News\" (his brother) created the New England Courant, the first \"newspaper\" in the colonies. It was there that when twelve years of age, in 1721, Benjamin \"inveigled\" his brother into being an apprentice for the paper. James's friends and even the governor pressured James to not allow this. In their eyes, \"thinking of printing as a poor trade would serve to degrade the man in the eyes of a gentleman of quality.\" James was likened to a person with a magnificent diamond in a dunghill pit. It was now that Wately offered to take Benjamin off of James's hands and place him into a better trade. This offer was turned down, and a frustrated James made Benjamin sign an \"indenture\" binding a thirteen-year-old Benjamin to serve a twenty-one-year term as an apprentice.\n\n2. Achievements and Contributions\n\nHis first major invention was the Pennsylvania fireplace, which was an invention designed to make stoves safer, more efficient, and less smoky. He also invented the Franklin stove, which was a metal-lined fireplace said to save one-quarter of the wood and produce twice the heat. Another of his discoveries was the lightning rod. His study of electricity led him to believe that lightning had similar properties to electricity. A lightning rod would prevent the destructive damage that lightning inflicted on buildings. His proposal was met with resistance from the locals, but modern tests with lightning rods have come to prove that Franklin was right about this as well. Franklin also played an important role in the American Revolution. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and a diplomat to France, using his charm and intelligence to secure aid for the colonists. He was a major author of the Declaration of Independence. He also worked to secure the French alliance during the war, which was crucial to the American victory over Great Britain. His diplomatic efforts in France were critical and ultimately led to the 1778 alliance with the French. In 1781, he and John Jay secured the signing of the peace treaty with Great Britain. Between 1779 and 1785, largely due to his instrumentality, the newly formed United States adopted constitutions and systems of government that were precursors to the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. With John Jay and Adams, he secured a preliminary peace treaty with Britain in 1782. He was one of the founding fathers of the United States. He was a prominent member of the Committee of Five that was chosen to write the Declaration of Independence. He was also a member of the Constitutional Convention.\n\n2.1. Inventions and Discoveries\n\nPhiladelphians were especially proud and flattered when the news of Franklin's inventions in Paris and London was spread into the colonies. They had always gloried in the self-trained genius of their \"useful citizen,\" and now his electrical achievements seemed to be but carrying further his tests of the possibilities of human knowledge and control over the forces of nature. In a native-took-for-granted way, they idolized him, which he liked and accepted, inasmuch as it did not demand too much of his time or pocket. Rich and poor respected and confided in him; he had acquaintances and correspondents all over the two continents and a wide human sympathy. Yet withal his political positions and professions were more the result of a sense of duty than the pursuit of ambition. He would have preferred to sit in his quiet study or to work in the Philosophical, and not the Congressional, Library, and there pursue the writing of a \"general Natural History of the Air.\" But the times were too critical and his devotion to public service too great for the life of a simple man of science. \"Nothing,\" he wrote to Ingenhousz in 1785, \"has ever hurt me so much and affected me with such keen sensations, as to find myself deserted in my old age by my only son and not only deserted, but to find him taking up arms against me in a cause, wherein my good fame, fortune, and life were all at stake.\" Temporarily broken, it seemed, by the pain and humiliation of this blow from William, Franklin's soul and health were soon to be revived during his mission to France. It was the most exultant episode of his life and his subtlest test upon the world's stage, where he wielded successfully the intricate weapons of international intrigue and diplomacy.\n\n2.2. Role in American Revolution\n\nIn December of 1774, Franklin was presented by the Pennsylvania Assembly with its official thanks and a payment of about $5000 to cover all his expenses in England in connection with the Assembly's affairs. This was the first public recognition of his services by the colony whose government had at one time bitterly opposed him. When Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, he was made a member of the Continental Congress and served on three committees: war, secret correspondence, and national safety. His record as a congressman was extraordinary, but he was soon called away to more arduous and thrilling service. At the Second Continental Congress, he was generally the leading spirit with Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin's years were now numbering threescore and fifteen, but age had not chilled his ardor for the public weal. And if the design of the colonies for a government independent of Great Britain was officially the work of younger men, somewhat against the judgment of the elder statesman, it was the natural outcome of the position which he had done so much to create. And the readiness for it of the average colonist was the fruit of his labor.\n\n2.3. Founding Father of the United States\n\nBenjamin Franklin is both a Founding Father of the United States and an Independence Day figurehead. His work in penning satirical, influential articles, essays, and persuasive works, while acting as the postmaster and printer for the American colonies between 1757 and 1775, would make him a vocal revolutionary against British policies and oppression. In his late 70s, living in the new nation of the United States, Franklin proposed abolition of slavery, and his reasoning for this radical idea would help shed light on the inner conflict between American colonies as his experiences as a slave owner provided him a viewpoint that centered around the humanity of all peoples, regardless of race. Although never truly succeeding against this deeply ingrained institution, Franklin would serve as a patriotic figurehead and catalyst for this important era in United States history. By the time of his tragic death, throughout all of his years of public service, he managed to contribute the equivalent of 26 years of his life to the United States and its citizens. Out of respect for his great sacrifices in representing the American nation, Congress declared 30 days of mourning in his honor. 283 years after his birth, Franklin remains one of the most extraordinary men to have ever lived. His remarkable achievements in such a wide variety of areas have left enduring legacies on countless aspects of both American and world culture and society.\n\n3. Personal Life and Legacy\n\nFranklin had two sons; the first, William Franklin, was born February 22, 1730. William was the Governor of New Jersey from 1763 to 1776, and he remained loyal to the British Crown throughout the American Revolution. His actions would create a rift between the two that would last for the rest of their lives. Franklin's second son, Francis Folger Franklin, was born October 20, 1732. He died of smallpox at the age of four. His only daughter to survive infancy, Sarah, was born September 11, 1743. She was the only one of Franklin's children to survive him. Sarah became a Loyalist and immigrated to England. She and Franklin were very close. When Sarah's son William Temple Franklin came of age, he too emigrated to Philadelphia. He is the most likely candidate for male-line descendants of Benjamin Franklin today. Deeply unsettled by the death of his son and the failing health of his wife, Deborah, a few years later, Franklin closed his shop in order to take stock of his life. Around this time, an old friend, Sir William Keith, the governor of Pennsylvania, suggested that Franklin go to London, the metropolis of the British Empire, to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Before returning to America indefinitely four years later, Franklin became involved in a multitude of projects to establish himself in England. He designed a pot-bellied stove, which offered a more efficient and less smoky alternative to the stovepipes then in use, and also was developing musical instruments. He sent an epitaph for his own tombstone which he never used: The Body of B. Franklin, Printer Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering & Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms.\n\n3.1. Family and Relationships\n\nHis marriage to Deborah Read (about 1730) was common-law only, as Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act of 1753, forbidding marriage without parental consent, did not go into effect in the American colonies until 1756. Benjamin and Deborah had two children. Their son, William Franklin, was born in 1731. He was the last colonial Governor of New Jersey (1763–1776) and a loyalist. He fathered William Temple Franklin. Benjamin's daughter, Sarah \"Sally\" Franklin, was born in 1743. She raised her only child, William Bache, who was born in 1762 during the Revolution, by her deceased husband, Richard Bache, a lawyer. Franklin was the grandfather of William Temple Franklin, who published the first 6 volumes of his grandfather's autobiography in 1818 and publicized his ideas of virtue and self-improvement, as well as his diplomatic roles in Colonial America and Europe. This work is the only one written by an American at that time which has been translated into the French language. In 1769 Benjamin Franklin became involved in a relationship with Anne-Catherine de Ligniville Helvétius, Mme. Helvétius, the widow of Helvétius. Their relationship is documented in Franklin's letters. Due to poor health, Mme. Helvétius stayed in a spa in the outskirts of Paris. In one of his letters, Franklin stated \"There is not a word in this vile world against love being of a long duration\". This phrase can be reflected unto his relationship with Mme. Helvétius. After leaving her care, Franklin never returned to the spa.\n\n3.2. Philanthropy and Public Service\n\nPhilanthropy and public service were very important to Franklin. One of his first public service undertakings was the establishment of the first public library in America. He was very proud of this accomplishment, and it was a lasting contribution to the city of Philadelphia. Franklin saw education as a way to build an informed and conscientious citizenry, and a means to better and advance society. This was the foundation for his passion for public education and is what led to his proposal for the Academy of Philadelphia. In their earlier efforts in a bill for the building of a new church in Philadelphia, Franklin had disputed the issue, citing that the money could be better spent in purchasing a cannon and supplies for the defense of the city. Though he had given up the argument, he used his idea in a much more positive way, and as a result of that conversation, a subscription was raised for the building of a new secondary school a few years later. In 1744, this school became the College of New Jersey, later to be named Princeton University. After this discussion, Franklin was elected to the board of trustees for the new school, and he served in this capacity until he retired from public service.\n\n3.3. Impact on American Society\n\nBenjamin Franklin's place in American history can be measured not so much by what he did as what he was. We have not discovered yet who set the boundaries of American values. Throughout his life, Franklin never wavered from the middle class. Although a member of the ruling elite in Pennsylvania, he identified with the plight of the common people. His clear and lively prose made him the best-known American in Europe and an international celebrity for his experiments with lightning and his magic squares. Franklin had a powerful effect on various aspects of American society. His greatest influence was in stirring up the people to an awareness of their shortcomings and the need for united effort. Franklin hoped to mold a distinctly American character and believed that the colonies, in their diversity, would become a melting pot in which the strengths of each group would blend into a new race. In spite of the failure of his plan of union at the Albany Congress, one of his greatest historical services was his position during the next 20 years when he promoted various intercolonial projects, such as a council for the cooperation of the colonies in defense and later the attempt after Braddock's defeat, to levy an authority of control or the home authorities by establishing their self-actions in France. The constitutional result of this was the essential covenant of the empire, imperialism of the American States, which created the nation. This was the realization of the dream which began in the controversy over republicanism. For these projects were not done at the urging of an imperial agent, but by the suggestion of the colonists and were successively fruitless to later attempts of the colony to weaken English supervision in the decade prior to the revolution. We then had an attempt to establish a union symbol that the Congressional Act of 1775 could be defined as an adherent or a rendition of the force of when the colonists were acting upon nature and a short experience in the colonial partition were the significant laws of union and inter-colonial action and in indoctrination of the colonial revolution into the character which they completed during the revolution. This transformation was not a direct result, for the action was repealed after the treaty with France. Yet, the enforcement of it brought so great a derision upon the colonial cause and caused such distrust that the slow repeal was one of the early causes of the revolution. Franklin's effort to prevent the division of the colonies and up to the revolution convinced himself that he began to switch and had cleaned from 1 June 1757 to are coming disgrace to swear and will now America municipii sterilia run more faithful return to stops which may be a better character."
