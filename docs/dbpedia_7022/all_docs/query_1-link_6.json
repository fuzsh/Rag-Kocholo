        "text": "So on my sick day today I was looking around the internet and I found out that Benjamin Franklin and his wife Deborah had a son, Francis Folger who was born in 1732 and died in 1736 of smallpox right before he was too be inoculated. Being the only legitimate son of Benjamin Franklin, I’m sure his survival would have somewhat of an impact on history and that he would have a pretty good career. So what’s in store for a surviving Franklin? From what I read his parents dotted on him, so maybe he would become Governor of New Jersey instead of william? Please put any thoughts! Thanks\n\nPolitics, presumably.\n\nThat’s what I thought but what exactly. I was thinking maybe he’d get the position as governor of New Jersey instead of his brother and actually resign when his dad asked."
