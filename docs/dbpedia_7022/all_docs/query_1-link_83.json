        "text": "Benjamin Franklin has a long list of contributions to science and medicine, from bifocals to the lightning rod.\n\nAlthough he didn’t invent a vaccine, he did become a strong proponent of variolation.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Regretted Letting His Son Die of Smallpox\n\nWhy?\n\nHis son Francis Folger Franklin died of smallpox when he was just four years old.\n\nTragically, he hadn’t been inoculated against smallpox yet.\n\nBenjamin Franklin later wrote in his autobiography that:\n\n“In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.”\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nLike Roald Dahl‘s letter following the death of his daughter from measles, it is a good reminder to get your kids vaccinated and protected against vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nMore on Benjamin Franklin and Vaccines\n\nParents Who Regret Not Vaccinating Their Kids\n\nDo Anti-Vaccine Parents Ever Change Their Minds?\n\nVaccinated vs Unvaccinated – Smallpox Edition\n\nShould I Be Worried That My Kids Didn’t Get the Smallpox Vaccine?\n\nLife, Liberty and the Pursuit of Vaccines\n\nEpidemiologist Benjamin Franklin\n\nLast Updated on May 25, 2024"
