Abiah Folger Franklin was born on August 15, 1667, on Madaket Road, Nantucket Island, to farmer and surveyor Peter Folger. She became the second wife of Josiah Franklin of Boston and had eight children, the youngest of whom was Benjamin. Josiah's first wife (the mother of his first 10 children) died, so Abiah raised all 18 Franklin children. There is a monument with flowers growing in it to honor Abiah on the right side of Madaket Road at the site of the Folger Farm, now owned by the Nantucket Historical Association."
