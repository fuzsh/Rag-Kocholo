        "text": "Franklin and his common-law wife, Deborah, lived simply and frugally. Only after Franklin had established himself with a dependable income did they buy more extravagant possessions, often from Europe. Many of these objects are still owned by Franklin’s descendants.\n\nFranklin and Deborah’s relationship was affectionate and loyal, if not particularly romantic. Deborah was involved in all aspects of the daily business, keeping the shop and its accounts. She raised William, Francis, and Sally in a crowded home typical of 18th-century artisans, sharing their space with Deborah’s mother and the family servants and slaves.\n\nThough William was Franklin’s illegitimate son, Deborah brought him up as part of the family. Francis, their first child together, contracted smallpox as a toddler and died, which caused his parents deep and lasting grief. Their youngest child Sally was only 14 when Franklin was dispatched to London by the Pennsylvania Assembly, but she adored him and looked after him when he returned to Philadelphia as an old man. She would ultimately bear all but one of the Franklins’ eight grandchildren.\n\nOver the course of their marriage, Deborah and Benjamin Franklin shared their house with Deborah’s mother Sarah Read their children, grandchildren, and an evolving mixture of relatives, houseguests, boarders, slaves, and servants.\n\nThe Franklin family moved several times before settling in “Franklin Court” on Market Street, Philadelphia, in 1765. References to the house and a few rough sketches in Franklin’s papers portray some details, but in the 1970’s the National Park Service decided that not enough was known to reconstruct it accurately."
