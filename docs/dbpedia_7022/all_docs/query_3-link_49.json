        "text": "The second of seven children, Deborah Read was born about 1707 to John Read, a British carpenter, and his wife Sarah White Read. It’s said that she received little formal education. Almost nothing else is known about her childhood.\n\nHer mother, Sarah White Read, made medicines. The evidence for this comes from Benjamin’s August 19, 1731 issue of The Pennsylvania Gazette, in which he advertised her “well-known ointment for the itch, with which she has cured abundance of people in and about this city for many years past.” To historians of dermatology, the itch was scabies, the infection caused by the parasite sarcoptes scabiei.\n\nContinuing in her mother's footsteps, Deborah Read made several of these medicines over the years... ointments and salves sold at the Franklin shop.\n\nThe two met in 1723 when Benjamin ran away from his apprenticeship to Philadelphia and eventually ended up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While in Philadelphia, Franklin became a boarder in the Read household, and soon found work as an apprentice printer.\n\nOn September 1, 1730, the couple entered into a common law marriage, agreeing to live together as husband and wife without formal approval by religious or civil authorities. He and Deborah were still teenagers.\n\nDeborah Franklin gave birth to two children. Their first child, a boy named Francis Folger Franklin, died in 1736 at age four of smallpox... a contagious disease that causes fever, vomiting and skin eruptions. Their daughter Sarah was born in 1743.\n\nShe also agreed to take in Benjamin’s older son, William, whom she and Benjamin raised from the time that he was a baby.\n\nWhen Franklin began his frequent absences on government business, Deborah managed their businesses and sold such items as soap, medicines, chocolate, tea, cloth, feathers and lottery tickets.\n\nAround 1773, Deborah began experiencing health problems. She died of a stroke on December 19, 1774.\n\nOn Christmas Eve William Franklin wrote to Ben, “I came here on Thursday last to attend the funeral of my poor old mother who died the Monday noon . . . She told me . . . that she never expected to see you unless you returned this winter, for she was sure she would not live till next summer. I heartily wish you had happened to come over in the fall, as I think the disappointment in that respect, preyed a good deal on her spirits.”\n\n---\n\nLike this post? Stop by and read ”Helena Rubinstein: The Polish Eagle of the Beauty Industry” In the early 1900s, women entrepreneurs were few. At the age of the 24, Helena set off to Australia aboard the Prinz Regent Luitpol with a parasol, twelve jars of face cream and twelve talismans. Helena opened her first beauty institute in Melbourne in 1902, capitalizing on women's burgeoning independence and turned equal rights into a marketing opportunity for her products. She sold the company to Lehman Brothers in 1928 before the Great Depression. She bought back $1.5 million in stock and increased its valuation to $100 million."
