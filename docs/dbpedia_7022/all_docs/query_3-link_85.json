        "text": "\"All that I am or ever hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.\"\n\nâBenjamin Franklin\n\nâ\n\nAbiah Folger Franklin may not be a household name like that of her renowned son Benjamin, but her impact on colonial America and the man who would become a Founding Father merits deep study by historians.\n\nBorn in Nantucket, Massachusetts, Abiah came of age in a time of great upheaval for Puritans seeking religious freedom in the New World. After an arranged marriage, she and husband Josiah Franklin embarked on the arduous journey across the Atlantic with their young children to forge a new life in Boston.\n\nAs a mother of seventeen in pioneer society, Abiah faced constant hardship and loss with steadfast faith and resolution.\n\nMost critically, she molded her brilliant son Benjamin from an impressionable child into a paragon of the American enlightenment through her devotion to both moral grounding and intellectual curiosity.\n\nThe full breadth of Abiahâs influence becomes clear through accounts of her tenacity, her central role in Benjaminâs upbringing, and her shaping of early colonial culture as wife, mother, and community leader.\n\nThough abstraction has obscured her legacy over two centuries, the contributions of this woman were indispensable in setting the stage for the American revolution. Any telling of our founding era would be incomplete without acknowledging Abiah Folger Franklinâs imprint upon it.\n\nâ\n\nABIAH FOLGER FRANKLIN WAS ONE OF 17 CHILDREN\n\nâ\n\nShe was born into the large, bustling household of Peter and Mary Folger, two devout Puritans who would go on to have 17 children in total, of which Abiah was but one.\n\nThe Folger clan made their humble living as candle and soap makers, working tirelessly to earn their daily bread.\n\nYoung Abiah would have grown up observing her parents' steadfast work ethic, Puritan values, and devotion to family. Surrounded by so many siblings, she likely had to fight for her fair share of food, clothing, and parental affection.\n\nThe crowded family home would have had a certain chaotic warmth to it, full of rambunctious children, bubbling pots of soap, and puritan sermons.\n\nFrom her parents, Abiah would gain a pious, prudent and principled outlook that would guide her throughout her life. By the time she reached maturity at 16, Abiah was conditioned through her upbringing to face life's trials and make her own way in the world.\n\nLittle did she know, her world was about to expand dramatically when her family decided to embark on a perilous journey across the Atlantic to seek religious freedom.\n\nâ\n\nSHE MARRIED JOSIAH FRANKLIN & GAVE BIRTH TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\nâ\n\nIn the year 1683, at the tender age of 16, Abiah was wed to an enterprising young candle and soap maker by the name of Josiah Franklin.\n\nThough certainly nervous and apprehensive about leaving her childhood home, Abiah was ready to embark on this new chapter of her life as Josiah's wife. The couple were united in the Puritan faith and in their skilled trades, both coming from hardworking families of candle makers.\n\nWhile still in her teens, Abiah rose to the difficult task of running a household and helping Josiah's business thrive. She became well-versed in the soap boiling and candle dipping trade.\n\nThe early years of marriage saw Abiah standing dutifully by her husband's side, establishing their name and livelihood in the village.\n\nBy the time she turned 20, Abiah was already a mother several times over. Bearing child after child, she became a pro at managing a bustling home and caring for little ones.\n\nHer greatest pride and joy came in 1706 at the birth of her 15th child, a boy named Benjamin.\n\nThough Abiah could not know Benjamin's destiny at the time, she sensed he was special, and doted on him amongst her many other offspring.\n\nBenjamin would be the child that inherited Abiah's intellect and curiosity, going on to make the Franklin name known.\n\nâ\n\nSHE INFLUENCED BENJAMIN'S LIFELONG LOVE OF READING & WRITING\n\nâ\n\nIn the absence of formal schooling in Boston during the late 1600s, the instruction of the Franklin children fell chiefly to Abiah.\n\nThough Josiah worked long hours at his trade, Abiah made the time to impart the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic to the young ones crowding her humble home.\n\nShe took this maternal duty quite seriously, drilling her offspring relentlessly and keeping a strict, disciplined household focused on education.\n\nBenjamin proved a particularly eager and quick study from a very young age. Abiah nurtured her son's insatiable hunger for books, guiding him through the family's small library and the Bible first and foremost.\n\nShe saw how he devoured every printed word he could get his hands on.\n\nAs he grew older, she made sure to discuss and debate aspects of religion, philosophy, and the natural sciences that captivated Benjamin. His abundant questions about the world and its workings did not go unanswered thanks to Abiah's teachings.\n\nShe spurred his experimental side as well, letting him dabble in inventing and improvements around the house. Abiah understood early on that Benjamin had a brilliant and restless mind.\n\nShe did her utmost to ground him in Puritan faith while fueling his desire for knowledge in all forms.\n\nThough Josiah thought Benjamin should train as a clergyman, Abiah assured her husband the boy was destined for other pursuits.\n\nâ\n\nSHE STEPPED IN TO RAISE BENJAMIN MORE THAN HIS FATHER DID\n\nâ\n\nBy all accounts, it was Abiah who took the most hands-on role in raising and nurturing Benjamin from infancy through adolescence, far more so than the boy's father Josiah.\n\nEver the busy businessman and breadwinner, Josiah was rather absent in his parenting, completely consumed by his candle and soap making concerns.\n\nYoung Benjamin instead turned to his mother Abiah for affection, instruction, and support in his many intellectual pursuits. Mother and son shared a profoundly close bond.\n\nAbiah was Benjamin's teacher, mentor, and champion early on.\n\nIn his later published autobiography, Benjamin would pay warm tribute to Abiah's instrumental influence, crediting her for his love of reading and thirst for knowledge. He affectionately recalled sitting by her side as she went about her household duties, sharing stories from the Bible or testing his spelling.\n\nAbiah made sure her busy, brilliant son was looked after, keeping him on a wholesome path and encouraging him to develop his gifts. She recognized his potential and subtly molded him into both a pious Puritan and an inquisitive thinker.\n\nWhen Benjamin reached adulthood and found success, he always remembered the mother who made his ascent possible through her faith in him. More so than any other family member, Abiah deserves credit for nurturing Benjamin Franklin's genius.\n\nâ\n\nABIAH FOLGER FRANKLIN WAS KNOWN FOR BEING INTELLECTUALLY SHARP\n\nâ\n\nContemporary accounts of Abiah Franklin paint a picture of a woman who was as mentally sharp as she was physically resilient.\n\nThough burdened with the endless tasks of raising children, keeping house, and helping her husband's business, Abiah maintained an engaged and active mind.\n\nShe took a keen interest in theological matters, educating her children in Puritan teachings as well as reading, writing, and arithmetic. Abiah engaged meaningfully with her bright son Benjamin in conversations about morals, science, philosophy, and religion, helping to nurture his budding genius.\n\nShe displayed cleverness and wit even as she went about her daily chores and child-rearing.\n\nBeyond her intellectual talents, Abiah possessed legendary stamina and fortitude.\n\nDespite giving birth to a whopping seventeen children, she maintained the energy and strength of someone half her age.\n\nFriends marveled at how she could work from dawn to dusk, accomplishing in one day what most people could not do in a week. Her physical vitality was mentioned by many who knew Abiah.\n\nShe appeared to thrive on hard work and have unlimited reserves of strength to draw from.\n\nWhether tending the home and family, assisting Josiah with his business, or joining in with parish activities, Abiah attacked every task with an almost supernatural vigor while maintaining her warm, virtuous spirit.\n\nâ\n\nSHE OUTLIVED HER HUSBAND & MOST OF HER CHILDREN\n\nâ\n\nAfter more than six decades living in the colony of Boston, Abiah found herself an elderly widow and matriarch in the mid-18th century.\n\nThough she had survived her husband Josiah and buried ten of her seventeen children, Abiah remained in decent health and sound mind into her 80s.\n\nHer prodigal son Benjamin had long since moved away to Philadelphia and become one of the American colonies' most prominent statesmen, scientists, and thinkers. Despite the distance between mother and son, they kept up a regular correspondence.\n\nIn 1752, at the venerable age of 84, Abiah Franklin finally passed away, having outlived almost all her contemporaries.\n\nIt was said she retained her intellectual faculties till the very end.\n\nUnfortunately, news traveled slowly in those days.\n\nBy the time word reached Benjamin of his mother's death, she had already been laid to rest.\n\nRegretting that he could not pay his last respects in person, Benjamin wrote movingly of feeling Abiah's loss deeply. Though she had led a long and fulfilled life, he lamented being absent at the time of her death.\n\nFor the rest of his days, Benjamin would remember Abiah Franklin as the mother who, more than anyone else, cultivated his curious mind and made him the historic figure he became.\n\nâ\n\nSHE HELPED SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THE NATION\n\nâ\n\nThough she lived a humble colonial life as wife and mother, Abiah Franklin had an outsized impact on history through the influence she wielded over her son Benjamin.\n\nAs Benjamin Franklin went on to become one of the most acclaimed Founding Fathers, a leading author, scientist, inventor, and statesman of the Revolutionary era, Abiah's role as his primary educator and moral guide cannot be understated.\n\nShe set the course of his intellectual development from the very start by nurturing his insatiable curiosity and providing the tools to mold him into an eminent thinker.\n\nHad Abiah discouraged Benjamin's scientific tinkering or stifled his independent spirit, the world may have been deprived of his invaluable contributions to physics, engineering, political philosophy, literature and more.\n\nThe thirst for knowledge, drive for discovery, and ethic of self-improvement that Abiah instilled in her son were the seeds that sprouted into a paradigm-shifting career improving society across many fronts.\n\nThough she did not live to see the American Revolution wonâAbiah directly influenced the man who helped bring the nation into being through his diplomacy, scientific advancements, and progressive values.\n\nEvery life she touched as wife, mother, and stalwart Puritan woman strengthened the fledgling society around her. But it was through Benjamin Franklin that Abiah Franklin left her greatest mark on history."
