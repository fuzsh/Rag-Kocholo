        "text": "Benjamin Franklin and his future wife, Deborah Read first saw each other in 1723 on his arrival in Philadelphia, when they were only teenagers. By then, the Read family was well established in the community, where Deborah was a parishioner at Philadelphia’s Christ Church. Benjamin rented lodging from her parents, which led to a brief courtship with Deborah until he left for London in 1724. After his return to Philadelphia and after each had seen other relationships wither, they rekindled their romance and entered into a common-law marriage in 1730.\n\nIn time, Deborah bore them two children, Francis (Franky) and Sarah (Sally), and also agreed to take in Benjamin’s older son, William, whom she and Benjamin would raise from the time he was a baby. Deborah managed the household and worked with her husband to keep the shop stocked and the businesses running—selling goods of her manufacture and doing the bookkeeping. “We throve together,” Benjamin wrote in his autobiography, “and have ever mutually endeavour’d to make each other happy.”\n\nBeginning in 1757 with Benjamin’s first long trip to London, the Franklins kept extensive correspondence across the Atlantic; their letters were both practical, with business and bits of information to be passed along, and full of affection, calling each other by pet names and discussing the challenges of their time apart. Still, though we know it was her preference to remain in Philadelphia, Benjamin’s absence wore on Deborah. After suffering a major stroke, her health took a turn during his final years in London. She wrote to him of her illness—her shaky handwriting betraying her failing health—but he would not return to her before she passed away.\n\nWilliam Franklin was Benjamin’s first child and his only son to survive into adulthood. His exact birthday is unknown, as is the identity of his mother, but he was born sometime around 1730, and Benjamin and Deborah Franklin raised him together in their Philadelphia home. Benjamin, who by the time of William’s early childhood was a man of means and stature in Philadelphia, made a point to avail his son of the education and opportunities for advancement he had not had in his Boston youth.\n\nBenjamin and William were a remarkably close pair. A friend reported that Benjamin was more than William’s father, he was also “his friend, his brother, his intimate, and easy companion.” William assisted in the kite experiment, making him the only person to witness his father’s successful demonstration that lightning is electricity. In the 1750s, the two of them traveled to London, where William practiced law and together the Franklins promoted their family’s interests within the British Empire. Father and son attended the coronation of King George III in 1762, and the following year, William, though only in his early thirties, was appointed Royal Governor of New Jersey.\n\nLike his father, William had his own son out of wedlock, William Temple Franklin. Unlike Benjamin, William did not raise Temple. Unaware of his paternity, Temple grew up with a foster family in England. Benjamin eventually brought him back to America and introduced him to his father and his stepmother, William’s wife Elizabeth, who accepted Temple with open arms.\n\nAs Britain and the Thirteen Colonies split apart, so did William and Benjamin Franklin. While his father was in London representing several colonies before the King and Parliament, William was the King’s man in New Jersey, and they began to view the growing crisis from opposing perspectives. When war came, William remained a Loyalist, and his father became one of the most ardent Revolutionaries. While Benjamin was working in the Continental Congress to produce the Declaration of Independence, William was arrested by rebel soldiers and held as a political prisoner. He would spend years in jail, including eight months in solitary confinement. William’s sister Sally appealed for leniency on his behalf, but his father did not lift a finger to help him. While William was imprisoned, his wife, Elizabeth grew dangerously sick. William pleaded with his captors for the opportunity to visit her in her illness, but was denied parole. She died without seeing her husband in 1778. William was released from captivity later that year and went to British-occupied New York City, where he coordinated Loyalist raids against the United States in New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York.\n\nAfter the war, William settled in England. He saw his father once more, at Southampton, but Benjamin was not interested in a reconciliation. He treated the meeting as a business engagement and had William turn over his North American properties to his son, Temple. William died in 1813 and was buried in the graveyard at London’s St Pancras Church. When the grounds were later renovated, his body was moved and his grave lost.\n\nThe youngest Franklin child, Sarah Franklin, called “Sally,” was born in 1743, just as her father was beginning his political career. Benjamin was often gone on business, including the three long trips to Europe that kept him an ocean away from his daughter for twenty-five years. Though they discussed having her join Benjamin’s last sojourn in London, as her brother William had on the previous stay, she remained in Philadelphia with her mother, Deborah. Sally married Richard Bache in Philadelphia, while her father was gone, and the two of them took care of Deborah after her stroke. Sally had her first two children before Benjamin returned. She named them for her father and brother—Benjamin Franklin Bache (or “Benny”) and William Franklin Bache (“Willy”).\n\nWhen the war came, Sally was briefly reunited with Benjamin in Philadelphia, where he served in the Continental Congress until he left for his diplomatic mission to France. Unlike her older brother, Sally sided with the United States in the American Revolution, distributing clothes and actively fundraising for the Continental Army. When the British occupied Philadelphia in 1777, Sally and her family were forced to evacuate the city mere days after she gave birth to another child. “I never shall forget nor forgive them,” she wrote of her experiences as a refugee, “for turning me out of House and home.” The Baches returned to Philadelphia after the occupation, and as the war wound down, she hoped William and Benjamin could reconcile. “I should despise the Person who could not make a distinction between a Political difference and a Family one,” she wrote, “I ever held those People cheap, who were at varience with their near connections.”\n\nAs her mother had when she was alive, Sally and Richard managed the Franklins’ affairs in Philadelphia while Benjamin was abroad. In the eight and half years her father was in France, Sally gave birth four times. She wrote him letter after letter describing the children and expressing their mutual yearning for the family to be united again. “When Betty looks at your picture,” Sally wrote, “she wishes her Grand Papa had teeth that he might talk to her, and has frequently tried to tempt you to walk out of the frame to play with her.” Sally welcomed her father home in 1785 and was with him when he died five years later.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s line continues through Sally, his only child with known surviving descendants. Sally died in 1808.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s mother and father, Abiah and Josiah Franklin, settled in Boston in the late 17th Century. Josiah had moved from Ecton, England, to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1683. His first wife, Anne, died giving birth to their seventh child. He then married Abiah Folger of Nantucket, and they had ten children together. Benjamin was the eighth—and the youngest son. The Franklins, who made candles and soap professionally, were deeply religious. They attended South Church, one of the town’s three congregations of Puritans. Though Benjamin left Boston in 1723, he kept in touch with his parents and paid for their gravestone, which noted that “They lived lovingly together in Wedlock Fifty-five Years; And without an Estate or any gainful Employment, By constant Labour, and honest Industry, With GOD’s Blessing Maintained a large Family Comfortably.”\n\nJane Franklin Mecom was Benjamin Franklin’s youngest sister and his only true lifelong correspondent. He encouraged her to learn to read and write, and the two of them exchanged letters until his dying day. She wrote to him about her twelve children in Boston, and Benjamin employed one of them, Benjamin Mecom, as a printer’s apprentice. Jane wrote war letters to her brother during the early battles around Boston in the American Revolution. Her son, Josiah Mecom, fought for the Patriots and died; one of her in-laws died fighting for the British. “O how horrible is our situation,” she wrote to Benjamin, “that relations seek the destruction of each other.” Jane lived as a refugee for much of the war, leaving Boston to live for a time in Rhode Island and Philadelphia. She eventually moved back to Boston and continued to exchange mail with her brother. “He while living was to me every enjoyment,” Jane wrote about Benjamin after his death in 1790, “Whatever other pleasures were, as they mostly took their rise from him, they passed like little streams from a beautiful fountain.” Jane died in Boston in 1794."
