        "text": "This portrait of William Temple Franklin is one of five miniatures painted by John Trumbull in preparation for The Treaty of Peace, an unexecuted painting commemorating the 1783 accord signed in Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. Shortly after publicly announcing his plans for the subject in 1790, Trumbull began to take portraits of the prominent figures involved in the negotiations: Henry Laurens, John Jay, and John Adams, the three American peace commissioners deputized by Congress, as well as George Hammond, who served as the secretary to the British delegation, and William Temple Franklin, grandson of Benjamin Franklin. The nonmarital child of Benjamin Franklin's son William, William Temple Franklin was adopted by his grandfather and later appointed secretary to the American delegation at the treaty talks."
