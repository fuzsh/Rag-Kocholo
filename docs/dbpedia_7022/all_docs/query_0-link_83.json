        "text": "This story was originally published November 27, 2014.\n\nWho was Lee of Fort Lee, Votee of Votee Park and Merritt of Camp Merritt? The Name-Dropper gives you the lowdown on some of the people whose names you see on public statues, memorial plaques, park signs, highways and even some local streets around North Jersey. Have suggestions? Email them to features@northjersey.com and put Name-Dropper in the subject field.\n\nEverybody knows that Franklin Turnpike was named for the grand old man of the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin, right?\n\nYou remember Ben, the heavyset guy who flew that kite in the electrical storm, who invented bifocals and the concept of the lending library. Ben, who told us: \"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"\n\nCaution: Don't bet on Ben. Truth is that the turnpike, an important north-south route through parts of Bergen County, was not named for Ben, not for Aretha, not for FDR and certainly not for Moe, who played 61 games for the Detroit Tigers in the early 1940s.\n\nThe Franklin in question was Ben's illegitimate son, William, whose politics were far removed from his dad's. Ben was part of the Colonial revolution. William was a staunch loyalist and, in fact, the Colonial governor of New Jersey for 13 years, appointed in 1762 by no less than King George III. It was during this period that the turnpike was developed and named for William. Franklin Lakes is also named for the former governor.\n\nWilliam made no secret of his loyalist leanings and his devotion to the king. And in William, King George clearly had a man he could trust. In William's appointment, the king granted remarkable authority to his new governor: \"We do hereby give and grant unto you full power and authority to suspend any of the members of our said council from sitting, voting and assisting therein if you shall find just cause for so doing.\"\n\nLater in the appointment document George said: \"And you shall and may likewise from time to time as you shall judge it necessary adjourn, prorogue [discontinue] and dissolve all general assemblies as aforesaid.\"\n\nTranslation: No trial, no hearing, no appeal, no dissent. For the king's colonial councils it would be William's way or the highway.\n\nAs it turned out on July 4, 1776, Ben, age 70, put his life on the line by picking up a quill and signing the Declaration of Independence – \"We must all hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately,\" he famously said – as William, age 46, stewed in a jail in Connecticut.\n\nDespite his authority, William was known to be on fairly friendly terms with New Jersey colonists. But this changed after the first shots of the great fight were fired. William was strictly George's man. And that's what landed him in trouble; he was imprisoned after colonial forces discovered sensitive correspondence linking him to British intelligence.\n\nBefore friendships and father-son relationships dissolved, William was the 13th, and last, to hold the position of Colonial governor of New Jersey. Among his accomplishments was his support in the founding of Queen's College (later called Rutgers) and the introduction of lotteries, with entry fees used to pay for bridges, highways, turnpikes, and other infrastructure, according to proprietaryhouse.org, a website devoted to the mansion of the same name in Perth Amboy that was the official residence of New Jersey governors.\n\nThe Revolution revealed many points of contention between Benjamin and William. Possibly recalling that it was George himself – by the grace of God! – who named him governor, William was not enamored of representational government. Benjamin of course could have been hanged for his belief in it.\n\nFreed in a prisoner swap after two years in prison, William spent time in New York, where he was president of the Board of Associated Loyalists, whose name reveals its interests, and was active in other loyalist causes.\n\nAfter his activities were made public, William sailed to Britain where he lived until his death in 1813. He never returned to America but wrote to his father to ask for a meeting.\n\n\"Dear Son,\" Ben responded, \"I received your letter of the 22d and am glad to find that you desire to revive the affectionate intercourse that formerly existed between us.\"\n\nBut when they met, in 1785, the freeze had moderated only slightly, and four years later Benjamin Franklin wrote a new will, in which he never mentioned William except for leaving him a piece of real estate in Canada. Ben had two other children, Francis Folger and Sarah.\n\n\"In his father's eyes, William had committed not one act of disloyalty when he chose to support the English side during the American Revolution. He had committed two,\" writes Sheila Skemp, a Franklin biographer who teaches at the University of Mississippi. \"He had abandoned the American Colonies, his own country. And he had rejected the 'natural duties' a son owed to a loving devoted father, duties that preceded any political allegiance.\"\n\nBen Franklin, who died five years later, never reconciled with his son."
