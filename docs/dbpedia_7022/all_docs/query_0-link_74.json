He was 8 years old when he began. This is the only formal education Ben had. He became a writer, inventor and polymath through his own reading and studies later on.\n\nFirst Occupation\n\nFranklin's father wanted him to be a clergyman but was not able to afford to send him to many years of religious schooling. Instead, young Benjamin was apprenticed to his older brother James who owned a printing shop. There Ben learned the skills of printing, writing and typesetting. Typesetting was the method used in those days to print paper where letters were placed tightly together, covered with ink and pressed onto paper. As an adult these skills would make Franklin famous as an author, publisher and printer when he opened his own printing shop some years later.\n\nOccupations\n\nBriefly indentured as a cutler, which means he made and repaired knives and other cutting tools - 1717\n\nApprenticed to his brother James as a printer - 1718\n\nHired in the shop of Samuel Keimer as a journeyman printer in Philadelphia - 1723\n\nWorks for printers Samuel Palmer and John Watts in England, teaches swimming lessons in the River Thames - 1724-1726\n\nWorks in clothing and hardware store of merchant Thomas Denham in Philadelphia as a bookkeeper and shopkeeper - 1726\n\nWorks for printer Samuel Keimer in Philadelphia - 1727\n\nEstablishes his own printing shop with Hugh Meredith - June, 1728\n\nPurchases The Pennsylvania Gazette from Samuel Keimer - 1729\n\nElected Official Printer for the colony of Pennsylvania - 1730\n\nFranklin buys out his printing partner Hugh Meredith, becoming sole owner of the printing firm - 1730\n\nFranklin becomes a franchisor by buying the printing press and types for a partner in South Carolina in return for one third of the profits over a six year period, the first of many franchise arrangements - 1731\n\nFranklin started printing America's first German-language newspaper, Philadelphische Zeitung.

(William's mother is not known for sure) William became the last Royal Governor of New Jersey. This put him on the opposite side of his father during the American Revolution. William and his father were never reconciled and he fled the colonies with the retreating British army.\n\nFrancis Folger Franklin - born October 1732, died 1736 from smallpox.\n\nSarah Franklin (known as Sally) - born September 11, 1743, died October 5, 1808. Sarah married Richard Bache in October 29, 1767. She was a strong patriot during the Revolutionary War, raising money for the Continental Army, supervising the creation of shirts for the soldiers during the winter at Valley Forge and hosting her father's political gatherings. Sally also cared for her father Ben Franklin in his old age\n\nFamous relatives\n\nBen Franklin's mother was Abiah Folger. She was born on Nantucket, Massachusetts into a large family in 1667. Another Folger descendant was James Folger who founded the Folgers Coffee Company in 1860. James was the great-grandfather of Abigail Folger who was murdered in 1969 by the Charles Manson family, along with her friend Sharon Tate and others.\n\nFacts about Benjamin Franklin - The Revolutionary War\n\nHow he got involved in the independence effort?\n\nOne reason Ben Franklin became so determined to fight for liberty was a result of something that happened in his youth. Ben's older brother James, to whom he was apprenticed as a printer, was a tyrannical and unjust employer. In fact, in his autobiography, Franklin made the following statement, [James'] \"harsh and tyrannical treatment of me might be a means of impressing me with that aversion to arbitrary power that has stuck to me through my whole life.\"\n\nIn 1757, Benjamin Franklin went to England to represent the citizens of Pennsylvania in their grievances against the Penn family, who were the Crown appointed governors of Pennsylvania since its inception. Franklin ended up staying in England for nearly twenty years, eventually becoming the representative of Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Jersey and Massachusetts to the Royal Crown. Over the years, Franklin thought the British government's treatment of the colonists was growing more and more tyrannical. In 1772, Franklin's patience finally came to an end. He anonymously received some letters that were written by Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts. In the letters, Hutchinson urged the British Crown to send troops to Boston to quell the increasingly agitated citizens. Franklin viewed this as a horrible violation of the rights of British citizens and he sent the letters back to America to have them published publicly. Franklin eventually confessed publicly that it was he who had exposed the letters and was publicly reprimanded by the British government. Later that year he left England for good and joined the independence effort back in Philadelphia.\n\nDid he see military action during the war?\n\nFranklin did not see military action during the war.\n\nAccomplishments during the war\n\nBen Franklin was appointed by the Second Continental Congress to the \"Committee of Five,\" which was given the task of drafting the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson wrote the original draft, but with strong input from the other members who also revised Jefferson's original draft when it was complete. The other three members of the committee were John Adams, Robert Livingston and Roger Sherman.\n\nFranklin voted to accept the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, famously saying, \"We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.\" He signed the document along with the other members of Congress in August.\n\nBen Franklin served Congress in various important positions, including as Commissioner to Canada, Ambassador to France and as a member of the Committee of Secret Correspondence dealing with spying and foreign intelligence. While serving as Ambassador to France, Franklin was responsible for persuading the French to give large amounts of money, supplies and manpower, including ships, soldiers and experienced military leaders to the American war effort. This was probably Franklin's most significant contribution to the war effort.\n\nFranklin was one of three commissioners appointed by Congress to negotiate the terms of peace with Britain at the end of the war. The Treaty of Paris, as the peace treaty was known, was signed on September 3, 1783. The other commissioners were John Jay and John Adams.\n\nThough not during the period of the Revolutionary War, but still a significant moment in the founding of the United States, Ben Franklin was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and a signer of the United States Constitution in 1787.\n\nFacts about Benjamin Franklin - Offices He Held\n\nWhich government offices did he hold?\n\nClerk of the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly, October 15, 1736 - 1751\n\nDeputy Postmaster at Philadelphia, October 5, 1737 - 1753\n\nCommon Council of Philadelphia, October 4, 1748\n\nJustice of the Peace for Philadelphia, June 30, 1749\n\nRepresentative from Philadelphia to the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly, May 9, 1751 - 1764\n\nAlderman of Philadelphia - October 1, 1751\n\nDeputy Postmaster General of North America, August, 10 1753 - January 31, 1774\n\nCommissioner to Albany Congress from Pennsylvania, June-July 1754\n\nPennsylvania Assembly's Representative to the Crown in England, February 3, 1757 - 1762\n\n23rd Speaker of the House of the Pennsylvania Assembly, May 26, 1764 - October 1, 1764\n\n2nd time Pennsylvania Assembly's Representative to the Crown in England, October 26, 1764 - March 1775\n\nColonial Agent to the Crown from Georgia, April 11, 1768 - May 2, 1774\n\nColonial Agent to the Crown from New Jersey, November 8, 1769 - March 1775\n\nColonial Agent to the Crown from Massachusetts, October 24, 1770 - March 1775\n\nPennsylvania Representative to Second Continental Congress, May 6, 1775 - 1776\n\n1st United States Postmaster General, 1775 - 1776\n\nCommittee of Secret Correspondence (dealing with foreign intelligence and espionage) - November 29, 1775\n\nCommissioner to Canada, 1776\n\nServed on Committee to write the Declaration of Independence, June 1, 1776\n\nDelegate from Philadelphia to Pennsylvania state convention, July 8, 1776\n\nPresident of Pennsylvania convention July 16, 1776\n\nDelegate to Congress from Pennsylvania Convention, July 20, 1776\n\nUnited States Minister to France, September 26, 1776 - 1785\n\nNamed One of the Commissioners to Negotiate Peace with Great Britain, June 8, 1781\n\nUnited States Minister to Sweden, 1782 - 1783\n\n6th President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, October 18, 1785 - December 1, 1788\n\nWhich party was he in?\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War was over, two main political forces developed in the United States, the Federalists who advocated a strong central union of the states, and the anti-Federalists who advocated for a weaker central government.

The design had thirteen linked circles and the statement, \"We Are One,\" on one side and a compass with the sun shining down on it with the word, \"Fugio\" (Latin for \"I flee\") and the statement, \"Mind Your Own Business,\" on the other side.
