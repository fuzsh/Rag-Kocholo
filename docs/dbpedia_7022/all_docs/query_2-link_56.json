        "text": "Benjamin Franklin was a statesman, publisher, and inventor during the American Revolution. He was born on January 17, 1706. He also founded Philadelphia's first fire station and served as a diplomat to France. Benjamin even invented the first swimming flippers, originally intended for hand-wear. Benjamin Frankin married Deborah Read in 1730. The two had three children together; William Franklin (1730 - 1813), Francis Folger Franklin (October 20, 1732 - November 21, 1736), and Sarah Franklin Bache (September 11, 1743 - October 5, 1808). He is most well known for discovering electricity with his kite experiment on September 2, 1752. In 1774, after aiding in drafting and signing the Declaration of Independence, Franklin's studies in electricity advanced to some great breakthroughs. One such breakthrough was how to harness electricity. This discovery eventually took the form of the first electric light bulb. Franklin first presented his invention to the public soon after the revolutionary war ended in 1789. This achievement made Franklin famous and advanced American technology far ahead of any other nation. Franklin died at age 84 on April 17, 1790."
