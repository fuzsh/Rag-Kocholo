Francis Folger Franklin was born to Franklin and Deborah Read on October 20, 1732, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Called “Franky” by his parents, Francis was described as a “precocious, curious and special” child. Tragically, Francis died in 1736 at the age of four after contracting small pox. His tombstone read: “The delight of all who knew him.”
