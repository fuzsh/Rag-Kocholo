        "text": "Catherine Pavlovna´s first offer of marriage was received [when she was 14]. Tsar Alexander I´s wife, the Empress Elisabeth Alexeievna, had a sister by the name of Caroline who was the wife of the Elector of Bavaria. Her stepson, the future King Ludwig I, was 18 and looking for a wife. However, Tsar Alexander was not anxious to lose his sister and the Bavarian ruler´s new alliance with Emperor Napoleon served as an excuse to decline the offer. Years later, he was introduced to her at the peace conference in London and remarked at the narrow escape that he had had.\n\nA third and far more important suitor was to appear four years later. He was the Emperor Franz II of Austria, often referred to as the best of husbands and the worst of widowers because of his haste to replace a dead wife. By the time he died in 1835, Franz had married four times. His second wife, the Empress Maria Theresa, had just died in 1806 while in her thirteenth confinement. Emperor Franz wrote to the Empress Mother of Russia who was a sister of his first wife. At first the Empress Mother was favourable to the prospect, saying that he had been a good husband to her sister. Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna was thrilled at the thought of becoming an empress and wrote to Alexander,”... the Emperor made two women of quite different characters happy and from that point of view is most respectable... has a record as a good husband and that is much.” Tsar Alexandra then wrote to his mother relating gossip of peccadilloes commited when Emperor Franz was a young single man. The Empress Mother and Catherine Pavlovna laughed at the tales. All else having failed, Alexander then brought up the age difference, Franz being 19 years older than Catherine. Alexander´s sister replied, “My brother find him old but people are not old at 38. He is ugly but I shall never trouble about a man with a handsome face.” She added in another letter: “He is upright and kind... I want it...all is in the hand of providence. What will happen will happen.” Finally, a discouraged Franz abandoned the idea and married an Italian cousin, Archduchess Ludovika of Austria-Este."
