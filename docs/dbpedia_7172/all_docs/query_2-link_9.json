It's original name and origins are unknown, but it is believed to be the same apple referred to in Russia as 'Borovinka' or 'Borowitsky', renamed to honor Emperor Alexander's sister, Grand Duchess Catherine Plavnova, wife of Duke George of Oldenburg.\n\nThe apple quickly became an important apple in America due to its cold hardiness and was popular on homesteads across the west and is still widely available. While the date of introduction in Montana is unkown' it was noted as bearing in 1878 at the Pine Grove Farm in Stevensville, MT, one of Montana's first commercial orchards.\n\nAdditional Photos\n\nReferences\n\nApplename.com, 'Duchess of Oldenburg'.
