        "text": "BECAUSE THE LOVE NEVER DIE\n\nHistory of the King Wilhelm and Queen Catherine Pavlovna\n\nKing Fridrich held for the first time the throne of Wurttemberg, after his military help sending troops to fight alongside Napoleon finally as a currency was proclaimed the first king of Wurttemberg, and Stuttgart was his royal residence. His son Wilhelm, who pretended to be his successor, was married to Princess Charlotte of Bayern, daughter of King Maximilian, a totally political marriage and a woman he never wanted, to whom his first words were - our marriage is a victim of politics -\n\nIn Russia, King Fridrich de Wurttemberg's sister, Maria, was married to Tsar Paul, a marriage that had as a princess the young Catherina, an emotional, humble young woman with many illusions of being a great woman, she was pretended by Napoleon as wife only for political benefits, because at that time in Russia there was a lot of wealth and the struggles against them were not favorable. Catherina never wanted it, she was married to her cousin, Duke Jorge Von Holstein-Oldenburg, a noble man who lived in Saint Petersburg with whom he had two children. Duke Jorge in the middle of the Russian war against Napoleon, undertook his humanitarian work helping the returning soldiers, the road was difficult and thousands died on the way. Unfortunately Duke Jorge dies in the infected mission of a respiratory illness in the hospital, thus widowing Princess Catherina.\n\nCatherina Pavlovna\n\nKing Wilhelm I from Wurttemberg\n\nDevastated by the news, many historians highlight the great pain that Catherina suffered at the time, even cataloging her as having a depressive nature, so that her family tried to help her by looking for a new prospect to re-make her life, including the Emperor of Austria, which rejected the proposal by the Russian Orthodox religion of Catherina, but Catherina's family also helped motivate her to travel the world and know beyond its borders.\n\nDuring one of those trips he met in London with his cousin, Wilhem de Wurttemberg, with whom they began a friendship, gradually strengthening their relationship, even traveling together, letters were written and then met at a congress in the Vienna city, by then the rumors and expectations of their relationship was great, it was commented that an alliance between the future king of Wurttemberg and the princess of Russia could lead to a strategic alliance for Germany, become a strong state and even reach Being an Empire, for Catherina's ears that had her ambitions, as for the young prince, these ideas were very positive and motivating. After the fall of Napoleon and the loss of influence in international politics, Prince Wilhem finally managed to annul his marriage even by both the evangelical church and Orthodox Russia to finally be able to marry the woman he really wanted as a wife.\n\nThe wedding was held in Saint Petersburg in 1816 and the honeymoon was spent in Russia. It was the month of March when Prince Wilhelm finally arrives in the city of Stuttgart with his new wife Catherina and you are two children, in a caravan with several carriages full of riches, jewels and lots of money, the people received them in the square of castle with much joy and hope for the poor state that at the time did not pass a good social and economic situation. Initially it was thought that the small and poor city of Stuttgart would not be liked by the princess, since she was used to the riches of Russia, but her long journeys and the loss of her first husband at such a young age had developed in the princess a personality with greater openness with other priorities. The princess was granted the opportunity to build a Russian Orthodox chapel that was her religion since she was a child, the couple lived in the princes' palace in what is now King's Street a few meters from the castle square, La Queen Catherina had two daughters with King Wilhelm.\n\nâ€‹Catherina liked to spend the days in the BadCannstatt area in a small palace next to the Neckar River, which is now the Stuttgart Wilhema Zoo, in addition to her favorite place the ruins of the Wurrttember Castle, as well as a great significance historical, she was always part of the dynasty of the Wurttemberg house and such an emotional place made them feel more entrenched in those lands, besides that the panoramic view is impressive.\n\nFinally in 1816 King Fridrich dies and Prince Wilhem at 35 becomes King Wilheml 1st and Catherina at 28 years in the Queen of Wurttemberg. That same year was known as the year without summer, as the eruption of a volcano in Indonesia affected the global climate hitting that year to agricultural production in Europe causing more poverty and food shortages. So when he comes to power he finds a weak, poor state, with many debts inherited from King Fridrich, many needs that helped Queen Catherina feel much more useful and motivated to work for her people, because she always thought that wealth of Russian lands should be the conditions of the people of Stuttgart and Wurttemberg. Many are the works that were developed during his time, the construction of the Hospital that bears his name, a School for girls, the creation of the first Bank, the first festival in Bad Canstatt Volksfest that originally was exclusively for the promotion of the Agriculture.\n\nPaint of the Old Castle of Wurttemberg.\n\nUnfortunately in 1819, at the young age of 30, with only two years of having been crowned as the queen, Catherina dies suddenly, many rumors about her death have been ruled out, but it is said that it was caused by pneumonia and an infection of a Badly treated wound in your mouth. But the reality is that the news was devastating not only for the King, but for the entire population, many of the works she started never saw them finished.\n\nIn his memory King Wilhem ordered to build a beautiful chapel where his remains are now in one of the queen's favorite places, on the ancient ruins of Wurttemberg Castle, with a neo-classical style and inspired by the Pantheon in Rome , the small chapel is one of the most representative symbols of love in the city, where the manifesto \"Love never dies\" is taxed. King Wilhem lived for more than 45 years, he married Queen Puilina again, with whom he had his first male son and future King of Wurttemberg, but he never forgot Queen Catherina so it was his special request that At the time of his death, he was also buried next to her in this beautiful chapel.\n\nView inside the Grabkapelle"
