Never as Georg Prinz von Hohenzollern because only their South-German cousins use that title and surname. That damages the credibility of that Instagrammer indeed.\n\nAs was mentioned in a message above, this occurred months ago.\n\nI know the person who runs that particular Instagram page. They are Brazilian and very knowledgeable about royal history; they have at least one article published in Royalty Digest Quarterly some years ago. However, they can be a bit disrespectful and déclassé in their comments about royals from time to time.\n\nAs someone who has also had interactions with Princess Victoria, I can only say that she has always been extremely kind and helpful. I believe that we should treat others as we want to be treated. Victoria Romanovna is an extremely intelligent and talented person. She will and already has been a great asset, in my view, to the Russian Imperial Family.\n\nI am curious to see how this develops. Rebecca in no way is compatible with the rules Maria herself adhered as one of the pilars of her claim plus she is going to become 40 years old.\n\nThat Maria did not create the traditional House title Grand-Princess of Russia (\"Grand-Duchess\" in lousy English translation) but just a personal style HSH Princess Romanoff shows her mingled feelings about this union.\n\nBut having said that: contrary to so many others, bending House Laws into their direction (the Castros and the Savoias for an example) Maria kept the rules with which she desavoued others, so no \"conveniently weak knees\" here.\n\nAs a mother Maria looked very happy. As head of the House she had another position, so it looks.\n\nThe grand duchess has always adhered to the House Laws of the Russian Imperial House, which she took an oath to uphold when she succeeded her late father in 1992. Maria Vladimirovna's position about the marriage is clear: the bride is now HSH Princess Victoria Romanovna Romanoff (Romanova in Russia). Of course, there is always the possibility that the Fundamental Laws, which are extremely rigid, might be relaxed in the future. For the time being, however, Grand Duchess Maria acted in accordance with these laws.\n\nPersonally, I hope that someday Grand Duke George's marriage will be regarded as equal, and that his wife will be accorded the style and title HIH Grand Duchess of Russia. All of the reigning houses, and most of the non-reigning, have abandoned or changed the house laws that governed their dynasties.\n\nIt is simply a matter of modernity. We must adapt with the changing times.\n\nIn that case we can rest assured that this branch did adapt to modern times. Weren't those supposedly rigid laws bended before when it suited this line of the family? The laws were bent again and again for this branch, starting from the wedding of GD Kirill. They were bent for the wedding of GD Wladimir and later on they were bent yet again for his dauhgter Maria to succeed.\n\nConsidering the remarkable flexibility that this branch ahd before when it suited them I can't see why the Grand Duchess can not change the rules for her daughter-in-law and eventual descendants. If it does not happen I suppose that after her death the family will be extinct in the eyes of GDss Maria?\n\nWhen the Castros, the Savoias, the Romanias had a son, they never would have amended the rules. But ow eh... no little boy in sight? We conveniently bend the rules. Pas de problème!\n\nMaria Vladimirovna could have done the same: \"My son can not find an Ebenbürtige partner? No problem, we just bend the rules. It is 2021, isn't it\". How conveniently...\n\nIt speaks for Maria that she herself did not make a twist to make her own position totally unreliable. (This -of course- leaves it to Georgy Mikhailovich himself, the future Chef, to create Rebecca a Grand-Princess of Russia with the style of an Imperial Highness).\n\n(They were spinning it a bit by calling Rebecca and her father Nobile, which they are not at all. It is a honorific \"abused\" after granting them former a former imperial House Order. (Spinning it so that Rebecca really, really, really is not that \"commoner\" at all: she is a Nobile, folks!).\n\nI suppose an explanation for not having much flexibility on this particular subject is that Maria's claim is based on the fact that other branches of the family were excluded from succession due to their morganatic marriages. To change the rules for her son she would undermine her own position vis-a-vis the descendants of GDss Xenia & GD Alexander.\n\nIf the Grand Duchess were consistent in her approach to morganatic marriages she would have to exclude herself from succession too, due to the status of her mother's family..\n\nIt means Maria Vladimrovna should have to dismiss an Imperial Decree which was established way before she even was born:\n\nDecree of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. Grand-Prince Vladimir Kirillovich, on the recognition of the royal rank of the House of Bagration, 22 November/5 December 1946.\n\nHis Royal Highness Don Fernando María de Baviera y Borbón, Infante de España, Prinz von Bayern, asked me when his daughter, Doña María de las Mercedes de Baviera y Borbón, Infanta de España, Prinzessin von Bayern, was about to contract a marriage with Prince Irakly Georgievich de Bagration-Mukhraneli, whether, taking into account the independence of Georgia from 1918 to 1921 and the present position of its Royal Family, I could consider the proposed marriage to be an equal one.\n\nMy reply, which was conveyed to the Infante through the intermediary of the Spanish Minister in Berne, the Conde de Bailén, was in the affirmative, inasmuch as, after prolonged and careful study of the history of Georgia and of the Georgian question, and after consulting my uncle His Imperial Highness Grand-Prince Andrey Vladimirovich, brother of my late Father, and my advisers, and after correspondence with the historian, Professor M. Muskelishvili:\n\nI consider it right and proper to recognize the royal status of the senior branch of the Bagration family, as well as the right of its members to bear the title of Prince of Georgia and the style of Royal Highness. The present head of the family is Prince Georgy Alexandrovich.\n\nIf Almighty God, in His mercy, grants the rebirth of our great empire, I consider it right that the Georgian language should be restored for use in the internal administration of Georgia and in her educational establishments. The Russian language should be obligatory for general use within the empire.\n\nI have decided to draw up this Decree for the good of the Russian Empire and for the preservation of its territorial integrity in the future, and have deemed it right to affix my signature to it, in order to satisfy the legitimate national sentiments of the Georgian people and in the hopes of avoiding thereby a possible annexation of their fatherland by force of arms, in the event of its willful secession from the Russian Empire.\n\n(The original is signed in His Imperial Highness’s own hand\n\nV l a d i m i r\n\nSanlúcar de Barrameda,\n\n5 December 1946\n\nIt means Maria Vladimrovna should have to dismiss an Imperial Decree which was established way before she even was born:\n\nDecree of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H.

Had it not been for equal marriage laws, the morganatic Hohenbergs would have the more convincing claim."
