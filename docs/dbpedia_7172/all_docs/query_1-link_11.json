        "text": "A fascinating and informative interview was recently published in an international magazine out of Hungary known as “Gentleman’s Review.” The Grand Duke answered a number of important questions about his life, his history, his new life in Russia, and his upcoming marriage. One of the early questions is regarding his status not as a Prince of Prussia (his father’s family) but as a Grand Duke of Russia, and heir to the Headship of the House of Romanov:\n\n“I am glad that you ask this question because there is a lot of incorrect and misleading information online about this subject, and you give me the opportunity to clarify. I am first of all Grand Duke of Russia and my surname in my official documents is Romanov in virtue of the fact that before the marriage of my parents a dynastic agreement was drawn up, according to which my father converted to Orthodoxy, received the title and name of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia, and pledged to raise his children in the Orthodox faith and in the consciousness of belonging to the Russian Imperial House. The title of Prince of Prussia is also among my historical titles, but only after the Russian ones. It should be remembered that all the emperors of Russia, starting with Peter III, who reigned in 1761-1762, are Romanovs through the female line, and in the male line they belong to the Holstein-Gottorp line of the House of Oldenburg. But all of them were Romanovs. This is a common practice of all dynasties that allow inheritance through the female line. It’s the same principle that makes Prince Charles of Wales be a member of the Windsor dynasty and that prevailing upon the name of his father, Prince Philip, God rests his soul.”\n\nFor a link to the original article (in English) CLICK HERE."
