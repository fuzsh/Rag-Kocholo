GEDCOM Note

In 1816 the then crown prince Wilhelm von Württemberg in Petersburg married his cousin, Katharina Pawlowna, Grand Duchess of Russia. However, after only three years of marriage the beloved wife died at just 30 years of age. Just how great the esteem for and importance of the deceased Queen was, is shown by the willingness in 1819 to pull down the family seat of the Württembergs to make room for her sepulchral chapel (Grabkapelle). Queen Katharina had brought an unusually modern social structure to the state. She founded the first Württemberg savings bank, created schools with modern curricula, hospitals, children's homes and institutions for feeding the poor, which she paid for partially from her immense Russian dowry. As the Russian Grand Duchess she was a member of the Russian-Orthodox Church and remained so (an indispensable condition for the marriage of a Russian princess to a member of a Western dynasty of princes) when she wed the Lutheran Crown Prince Wilhelm. Every Whit Monday a church service is held in the Sepulchral Chapel in her memory.
