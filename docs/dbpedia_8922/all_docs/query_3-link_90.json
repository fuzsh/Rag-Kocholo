        "text": "About the program\n\nISC provides funding to First Nations child and family services agencies, which are established, managed and controlled by First Nations and delegated by provincial authorities to provide prevention and protection services. In areas where these agencies do not exist, ISC funds services provided by the provinces and Yukon but does not deliver child and family services. These services are provided in accordance with the legislation and standards of the province or territory of residence. As of January 1, 2020, service providers delivering child and family services to Indigenous children must comply with the national principles and minimum standards set in An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis children, youth and families.\n\nFunding for child and family services in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories is provided by the Department of Finance Canada through transfer payment agreements with the territorial governments, which make up a portion of their annual budgets. These governments decide how and where to spend the funds.\n\nISC uses a prevention-based funding model to support early intervention and alternatives to traditional institutional care and foster care, such as the placement of children with family members in a community setting.\n\nThe program provides 3 streams of funding:\n\nOperations: core and operational funding for protection services (such as salaries and overhead)\n\nPrevention: resources for enhanced prevention services\n\nMaintenance: direct costs of placing First Nations children into temporary or permanent care out of the parental home (such as foster care rates and group home rates)\n\nTo better support First Nations children's access to the support services they need to transition to adulthood, the program now provides funding to extend services for up to an additional 2 years after the youth:\n\nhas reached the age of majority in their province or territory, or\n\nis no longer eligible for extended care services as per the provincial or territorial legislation\n\nAs a result of the agreement-in-principle on long-term reform, on April 1, 2022, these supports will be made available until the youth turns 26 years of age.\n\nIn January 2016, in response to a 2007 complaint by the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found the FNCFS Program to be flawed, inequitable and discriminatory under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The tribunal ordered the department to cease its discriminatory practices and to reform the program and the1965 Agreement in Ontario (PDF, 1.37 MB, 182 pages) to reflect the findings in their decision.\n\nFurther orders were made in:\n\nApril 2016\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nMarch 2017\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nAugust 2020\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nAugust 2021\n\nNovember 2021\n\nThe Government of Canada has accepted the rulings and is working to fully implement the orders. In response to the February 2018 ruling, Canada immediately began to cover the actual costs of prevention, intake and assessment, legal fees, building repairs, child service purchase and small agency costs (in all areas), as well as actual costs of band representatives and mental health for First Nations youth, in Ontario, retroactively to January 26, 2016, and going forward until an alternate funding system is in place. ISC will continue to work closely with the Consultation Committee on Child Welfare to fully implement the orders.\n\nISC is also:\n\naccelerating Budget 2016 funds to meet the immediate service delivery needs for First Nations children and families\n\ncontinuing to support engagements and tripartite tables including\n\nEngagement on potential legislation co-developed with Indigenous communities on child and family wellness\n\nEngagement on improving child and family services in First Nations communities\n\nTripartite tables, technical working groups and regional advisory committees comprised of representatives from First Nations, ISC, all provinces and Yukon are in place:"
