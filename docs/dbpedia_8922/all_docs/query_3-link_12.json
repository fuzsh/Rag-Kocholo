Learn more about Carson City and Nevada’s history and the timeline of major milestones here in Carson City. See the right side navigation for more information and categories about Nevada’s history.\n\nThe History of Nevada – Dates and Events\n\n1844 Explorer John C. Fremont travels through Western Nevada, including the future site of Carson City. He names the river flowing through the valley, the Carson River, after his scout, Kit Carson.\n\n1851 Frank and Joseph Barnard, George Follensbee, Frank and W.L. Hall, and A.J. Rollins open a trading post at what today is the intersection of Thompson and Fifth streets. It is called “Eagle Station.”\n\n1854 Admitted as part of Utah Territory.\n\n1858 Abraham Curry, John J. Musser, Franklin Proctor, and Benjamin F. Green purchase 865 acres in Eagle Valley for $500 and a herd of horses. The four soon begin laying out a community, which Proctor names Carson City.\n\n1861 Nevada Territory is created and Carson City is designated the territorial capital.\n\n1864 Nevada gains statehood on October 31 and Carson City is selected as the state capital.

It includes the area around Wheeler Peak and Lehman Caves in eastern Nevada.\n\nNevada Facts\n\nFirst Settlement | A friendly debate exists between the towns of Dayton and Genoa, both near Carson City, and both settled in 1851. Dayton is the site of the first gold discovery in 1849.\n\nName | Adopted in 1861 when territory was established; from Spanish meaning “snow-capped.”\n\nState Capital | Carson City, selected 1864.\n\nState Flag | On a cobalt blue background; in the upper left quarter is a five-pointed silver star between two sprays of sagebrush crossed to form a half wreath; across the top of the wreath is a golden scroll with the words, in black letters, “Battle Born.” The name “Nevada” is beneath the star in gold letters. Design adopted March 26, 1929, revised in 1991.\n\nState Seal | Adopted February 24, 1886. The seal has the words “The Great Seal of the State of Nevada” around the outer edge. Within this, is a composite picture showing the mining, agriculture, industry and scenery of Nevada, under which is the state motto, “All For Our Country.”\n\nState Animal | The Desert Bighorn (or Nelson) Sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) is smaller than its Rocky Mountain cousin but has a wider spread of horns. The bighorn is well-suited for Nevada’s mountainous desert country because it can survive for long periods without water. The large rams stand about 4-1/2 feet tall and can weigh as much as 175 pounds.\n\nState Artifact | The Tule Duck was created by early Nevadans almost 2,000 years ago. Discovered by archaeologists in 1924 during an excavation at Lovelock Cave, the 11 decoys are each formed of a bundle of bullrush (tule) stems, bound together and shaped to resemble a canvasback duck.\n\nState Bird | The Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides) lives in the Nevada high country and destroys many harmful insects. It is a member of the thrush family and its song is a clear, short warble like the caroling of a robin. The male is azure blue with a white belly, while the female is brown with a bluish rump, tail, and wings.\n\nState Colors | Silver and Blue\n\nState Fish | The Lahontan Cutthroat Trout (Salmo clarki henshawi), a native trout found in 14 of the state’s 17 counties, is adapted to habitats ranging from high mountain creeks and alpine lakes to warm, intermittent lowland streams and alkaline lakes where no other trout can live.\n\nState Flower | Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) grows abundantly in the deserts of the Western United States. A member of the wormwood family, sagebrush is a branching bush (1 to 12 feet high) and grows in regions where other kinds of vegetation cannot subsist. Known for its pleasant aroma, its gray-green twigs, and pale yellow flowers, sagebrush is an important winter food for sheep and cattle.\n\nState Fossil | The Ichthyosaur (Shonisaurus) fossil was found in Berlin, east of Gabbs. Nevada is the only state to possess a complete skeleton (approximately 55 feet long) of this extinct marine reptile.\n\nState Grass | Indian Ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), once a staple food source for Nevada Indians, now provides valuable feed for wildlife and range livestock. This tough native grass, which is found throughout the state, is known for its ability to reseed and establish itself on sites damaged by fire or over grazing.\n\nState Metal | Silver\n\nState Motto | “All For Our Country”\n\nState Precious Gemstone | Among the many gemstones found in Nevada, the Virgin Valley Black Fire Opal is one of the most beautiful. The Virgin Valley in northern Nevada is the only place in North America where the Black Fire Opal is found in any significant quantity.\n\nState Semi-precious Gemstone | Nevada Turquoise, sometimes called the “Jewel of the Desert,” is found in many parts of the state.\n\nState Reptile | The Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), the largest reptile in the Southwestern United States, lives in the extreme southern parts of Nevada. Its hard, dome-shaped shell ranges from tan to black in color. This reptile spends much of its life in underground burrows to escape the harsh summer heat and winter cold. The desert tortoise can live to be more than 70 years old.\n\nState Rock | Sandstone, in its more traditionally recognized form or as quartzite, is found throughout the state. In areas such as the Valley of Fire State Park and Red Rock Canyon Recreational Lands, both near Las Vegas, it provides some of Nevada’s most spectacular scenery. The State Capitol, and the former United States Mint, are built of sandstone.\n\nState Song | “Home Means Nevada,” by Mrs. Bertha Raffetto of Reno, adopted February 6, 1933. “Home” means Nevada, “Home” means the hills, “Home” means the sage and the pines. Out by the Truckee’s silvery rills. Out where the sun always shines. There is a land that l love the best, Fairer than all I can see. Right in the heart of the golden west, “Home” means Nevada to me.\n\nState Trees | The Single-Leaf Pinyon (Pinus monophylla) is an aromatic pine tree with short, stiff needles and gnarled branches. The tree grows in coarse, rocky soils and rock crevices. Though its normal height is about 15 feet, the single-leaf pinyon can grow as high as 50 feet under ideal conditions. The Bristlecone Pine (Pinus aristata) shares the state tree designation. The Bristlecone Pine is the oldest living thing on Earth, with some specimens in Nevada more than 4,000 years of age. The tree can be found at high elevations. Normal height for older trees is about 15 to 30 feet, although some have attained a height of 60 feet. Diameter growth continues throughout the long life of the tree, resulting in massive trunks with a few contorted limbs.\n\nDid You Know? The combined city/county of Carson City is 146.9 square miles. The elevation of Carson City is 4,697 feet above sea level. Carson City is the only combined city-county government in Nevada. The population of Carson City is 55,274. The tallest point in Carson City limits is Snow Peak in the Sierra Nevada range, which rises 9,274 feet. Carson City’s first newspaper was the Territorial Enterprise, which had been started in 1858 in Genoa, then moved to Carson City a year later. In 1860, it moved to Virginia City, where it gained its greatest fame. Carson City’s first telephone line was strung in 1888. Carson City has an average yearly rainfall of 11.8 inches. Carson City has an average of 266 days of sunshine each year. The highest recorded temperature in Carson City was 103 degrees, reached on August 8, 1972. The lowest recorded temperature in Carson City was minus 18 degrees, reached on December 11, 1972. Major William Ormsby opened Carson City’s first commercial store in 1858.\n\nCinematic History\n\nMovies Made in Carson City Historians believe that the first film shot in Carson City was footage of the “Gentleman” Jim Corbett vs. Bob Fitzsimmons prizefight in March 1897. During the next century, more than a dozen other movies have been at least partially filmed in the Capital City, including the following:"
