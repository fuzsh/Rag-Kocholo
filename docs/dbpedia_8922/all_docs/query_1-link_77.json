        "text": "Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia was the son of Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia from the Přemyslid dynasty. His grandfather, Bořivoj I of Bohemia, was converted to Christianity by Cyril and Methodius. His mother, Drahomíra, was the daughter of a pagan tribal chief of the Havelli, but was baptized at the time of her marriage. His paternal grandmother, Ludmila of Bohemia, saw to it that he was educated in the Old Slavonic language and, at an early age, Wenceslaus was sent to the college at Budeč.\n\nIn 921, when Wenceslaus was about thirteen, his father died and his grandmother became regent. Jealous of the influence that Ludmila wielded over Wenceslaus, Drahomíra arranged to have her killed.\n\nLudmila was at Tetín Castle near Beroun when assassins murdered her on September 15, 921. She is said to have been strangled by them with her veil. She was at first buried in the church of St. Michael at Tetín, but her remains were later removed, probably by Wenceslaus, to the church of St. George in Prague, which had been built by his father.\n\nDrahomíra then assumed the role of regent and immediately initiated measures against Christians. When Wenceslaus was 18, those Christian nobles who remained rebelled against Drahomira. The uprising was successful, and Drahomira was sent into exile to Budeč.\n\nWith the support of the nobles, Wenceslaus took control of the government. He “…reined in the dependent dukes who had become restive under the regency and used Christianity to strengthen his state.”\n\nAfter the fall of Great Moravia, the rulers of the Bohemian Duchy had to deal both with continuous raids by the Magyars and the forces of the Saxon and East Frankish King, Heinrich I the Fowler, who had started several eastern campaigns into the adjacent lands of the Polabian Slavs, homeland of Wenceslaus’s mother.\n\nTo withstand Saxon overlordship, Wenceslaus’s father Vratislaus had forged an alliance with the Bavarian duke Arnulf, a fierce opponent of King Heinrich at that time. The alliance became worthless, however, when Arnulf and Heinrich reconciled at Regensburg in 921.\n\nEarly in 929, the joint forces of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and King Heinrich I the Fowler of East Francia reached Prague in a sudden attack that forced Wenceslaus to resume the payment of a tribute first imposed by the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia in 895.\n\nHeinrich had been forced to pay a huge tribute to the Magyars in 926 and needed the Bohemian tribute, which Wenceslaus probably refused to pay after the reconciliation between Arnulf and Heinrich. Another possible reason for the attack was the formation of the anti-Saxon alliance between Bohemia, the Polabian Slavs, and the Magyars.\n\nWenceslaus introduced German priests into his realm and favoured the Latin rite instead of the old Slavic, which had gone into disuse in many places for want of priests. He also founded a rotunda consecrated to St. Vitus at Prague Castle in Prague that was the basis of present-day St. Vitus Cathedral.\n\nAssassination\n\nIn September 935, a group of nobles allied with Wenceslaus’s younger brother Boleslaus plotted to kill him. After Boleslaus invited Wenceslaus to a celebration of the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian in Stará Boleslav, three of Boleslaus’s companions (Tira, Česta, and Hněvsa) fell on the duke and stabbed him to death. As the duke fell, Boleslaus ran him through with a lance.\n\nAccording to Cosmas of Prague, in his Chronica Boëmorum of the early 12th century, one of Boleslaus’ sons was born on the day of Wenceslaus’s death. Because of the ominous circumstance of his birth, the infant was named Strachkvas, which means “a dreadful feast”.\n\nThere is also a tradition that Wenceslaus’s loyal servant Podevin avenged his death by killing one of the chief conspirators, an act for which he was executed by Duke Boleslaus I the Cruel of Bohemia, brother and successor of Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia.\n\nThe Assassination of Wenceslaus has been characterized as an important turning point in early Bohemian history, as the rule of Boleslaus I saw him renounce the Franks, centralize power in Bohemia and expand the territory of the polity.\n\nWenceslaus was considered a martyr and saint immediately after his death, when a cult of Wenceslaus grew up in Bohemia and in England. Within a few decades, four biographies of him were in circulation. These hagiographies had a powerful influence on the High Middle Ages concept of the rex justus (righteous king), a monarch whose power stems mainly from his great piety as well as his princely vigor.\n\nAlthough Wenceslaus was only a duke during his lifetime, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I the Great posthumously “conferred on [Wenceslaus] the regal dignity and title”, which is why he is referred to as Good “king” Wenceslaus in legend and song.\n\nFrederik Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (September 28, 1765 – June 14, 1814 ) was a Danish prince and feudal magnate.\n\nFrederik Christian II was born the eldest son of Frederik Christian I, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1721–1794), by his wife and cousin Princess Charlotte of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön (1744–1770), daughter of Frederik Charles, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön and his wife Countess Christiane Armgard von Reventlow.\n\nUntil his father’s death, he was styled “Hereditary Prince of Augustenburg”.\n\nHe was a prince with an exceptionally high level of Danish blood in his ancestry: his maternal grandmother, paternal grandmother, and paternal great-grandmother having been born, respectively, Countess of Reventlow, Countess of Danneskiold-Samsøe, and Countess of Ahlefeldt-Langeland.\n\nHe was closely related to all important families of the Danish high nobility of the time. The negative side was that his ancestry was rather too much “comital” and too little royal. Instead of including royal princesses and duchesses of small and large German states, as was customary with the Oldenburg royal family, their marriage connections had been mostly with the nobility (chiefly of Denmark).\n\nThus, although they were undoubtedly the senior cadet line of the Royal House of Denmark (Oldenburg), the family was regarded as a bit lower than the Ebenbürtige which the rulers of small Germany principalities thought to be the standard.\n\nBy marriage, however, Frederik Christian drew closer to his cousins, the Danish Royal Family. In 1786, the twenty-year-old hereditary prince married his distant cousin, the fourteen-year-old Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark and Norway (1771–1843), purported daughter of Christian VII of Denmark by his wife, the late Queen Caroline Matilda, the youngest and posthumous daughter of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, by Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, Caroline Matilda was raised in a secluded family atmosphere away from the royal court of her grandfather King George II of Great Britain.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, she was married to her first cousin, King Christian VII of Denmark and Norway, who suffered from a mental illness and was cold to his wife throughout the marriage. She had two children: the future King Frederik VI of Denmark and Louise Augusta; the latter’s biological father may have been the German physician Johann Friedrich Struensee.\n\nLouise Auguste’s father, the king, was a man with mental disabilities and, throughout his reign, effective control was in the hands of other people (ranging from his step-mother to his wife to his half-brother to various courtiers).\n\nThe king’s mental condition, and his unharmonious relationship with his wife, gave rise to speculation that Louise had been sired by someone other than him, and rumour awarded fatherhood to Johann Friedrich Struensee, the king’s court physician and de facto regent of the country at the time of Louise’s birth.\n\nIndeed, she was at times referred to as la petite Struensee. The truth of the matter cannot be definitely ascertained.\n\nThe story of antecedents of Prince Frederik Christian’s marriage goes as follows: In February 1779, the nation’s foremost statesman, Chief Minister Count Andreas Peter Bernstorff, hatched an ingenious plan for the young princess, something that often has been customary with a royal child suspected of not being sired by its nominal father but in its mother’s illicit liaison: to marry such a child to another member of the royal house.\n\nSince a male child of hers could inherit the throne some day, it would be advantageous to arrange a marriage early, and to marry the “half-royal” back into the extended royal house, to the Hereditary Prince of Augustenburg.\n\nThis plan had the positive effect of more closely connecting the Danish royal house’s two lines, the ruling House of Oldenborg and the cadet House of Augustenburg, thus not only discouraging any breakup of the kingdom but also forestalling the possibility of a foreigner gaining influence into Danish affairs through marriage with her.\n\nThis would certainly happen, for instance, if Louise were to marry her closer relations, the Swedish royals. The danger of Louise Auguste marrying into the Swedish royal house (the latter danger was rather low, however: at that time, there were Swedish princes only twenty years or more her senior, and her first cousin, the future King Gustaf IV Adolph of Sweden, had just been born when she already was seven).\n\nBinding agreements were made as early as in 1780, when Frederik Christian was 15 and Louise was only 9 years old. Five years later, in the spring of 1785, the young Frederik Christian came to Copenhagen. The engagement was announced then, and a year later, on May 27, 1786, the wedding was celebrated at Christiansborg Palace.\n\nThe couple lived at the Castle for many years until the Christiansburg Palace fire of 1794 and the death of his father, the Duke of Augustenborg Frederik Christian I, at which point the prince inherited the estate and the duchy. After 1794, the couple lived during the summer on the island of Als and in Gråsten.\n\nDuke Frederik Charles died on June 14, 1814. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Christian August II, then but sixteen years old. Louise Auguste took control of the Augustenburg estates and the children’s upbringing. The estates were turned over to the son and heir on his return from an extended foreign tour in 1820.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm II (September 25, 1744 – November 16, 1797) was King of Prussia from 1786 until his death in 1797. He was in personal union the Prince-elector of Brandenburg and (via the Orange-Nassau inheritance of his grandfather) sovereign prince of the Canton of Neuchâtel.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm was born in Berlin, the son of Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia and Duchess Luise of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, daughter of Ferdinand Albrecht II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his wife Duchess Antoinette of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Duchess Antoinette Amalie was married to her father’s first cousin and was the youngest of four daughters born to Ludwig Rudolph of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his wife Princess Christine Louise of Oettingen-Oettingen.\n\nAntoinette Amalie’s older sister was Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttle, was the mother of Empress Maria Theresa, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI. Her other surviving sister Charlotte Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttle was the daughter-in-law of Emperor Peter I the Great of Russia, through marriage to his son and heir, Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich of Russia. Charlotte Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel was also the great aunt of Queen Marie Antoinette of France.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm’s father, Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, was the second son of King Friedrich Wilhelm I in Prussia and his wife Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, the only daughter of Georg Ludwig , Prince-Elector of Hanover, later King George I of Great Britain, and his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Celle. She was detested by her elder brother, King George II of Great Britain.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm II’s aunt; his mother’s elder sister, Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, was the wife of Prince August Wilhelm’s brother King Friedrich II of Prussia (“Frederick the Great”).\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm became heir-presumptive to the throne of Prussia on his father’s death in 1758, since Friedrich II had no children. The boy was of an easy-going and pleasure-loving disposition, averse to sustained effort of any kind, and sensual by nature.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm’s first marriage with his cousin Princess Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel*, was the seventh child and third daughter of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Princess Philippine Charlotte of Prussia, daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm I in Prussia and his wife Sophia Dorothea of Hanover.\n\nThe marriage was contracted July 14, 1765 in Charlottenburg, and was dissolved in 1769.\n\nOn July 14, 1769 also in Charlottenburg, Friedrich Wilhelm then married Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibrücken. She was born in Prenzlau. She was the sister of Grand Duchess Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, whom married duke (later grand-duke) Charles August of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach; as well as brother of Grand Duke Ludwig I of Hesse.\n\nAlthough King Friedrich Wilhelm II had seven children by his second wife, he had an ongoing relationship with his mistress, Wilhelmine Enke (created Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau in 1796), a woman of strong intellect and much ambition, and had five children by her—the first when she was still in her teens.\n\nPleasure-loving and indolent, he is seen as the antithesis to his predecessor, King Friedrich II the Great of Prussia. Under his reign, Prussia was weakened internally and externally, and he failed to deal adequately with the challenges to the existing order posed by the French Revolution.\n\nHis religious policies were directed against the Enlightenment and aimed at restoring a traditional Protestantism. However, he was a patron of the arts and responsible for the construction of some notable buildings, among them the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm I’s interventions in European affairs were of little benefit to Prussia. The Dutch campaign of 1787, entered into for purely family reasons, was indeed successful, but Prussia received not even the cost of her intervention.\n\nAn attempt to intervene in the war of Russia and Austria against the Ottoman Empire failed to achieve its objective; Prussia did not succeed in obtaining any concessions of territory, and the dismissal of minister Hertzberg (July 5, 1791) marked the final abandonment of the anti-Austrian tradition of Friedrich II the Great.\n\nMeanwhile, the French Revolution alarmed the ruling monarchs of Europe, and in August 1791 King Friedrich Wilhelm II, at the meeting at Pillnitz Castle, agreed with Emperor Leopold II to join in supporting the cause of King Louis XVI of France and Navarre.\n\nHowever the king’s character and the confusion of the Prussian finances could not sustain effective action in this regard. A formal alliance was indeed signed on February 7, 1792, and Friedrich Wilhelm II took part personally in the campaigns of 1792 and 1793, but the king was hampered by want of funds, and his counsels were distracted by the affairs of a deteriorating Poland, which promised a richer booty than was likely to be gained by the anti-revolutionary crusade into France.\n\nOn November 16, 1797 King Friedrich Wilhelm II died in Potsdam. He was succeeded by his son, as King Friedrich Wilhelm III who had resented his father’s lifestyle and acted swiftly to deal with what he considered the immoral state of the court. King Friedrich Wilhelm II is buried in the Berliner Dom.\n\n* Not to be confused with Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel wife Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI or Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern, the wife of King Friedrich II of Prussia.\n\nOn Sunday 26 March 1854, around 4:00 p.m, Charles left the Riserva Palace to take a walk on the streets of Parma, as he used to do every afternoon. He was accompanied only by an aide-de-camp, Count Bacinetti. During his walk, he saw his wife, Duchess Louise, who was sitting in a carriage, listening to an open-air concert in a square of Parma. They waved to each other politely.\n\nAt 5:45 the Duke was returning to his palace; while he was passing by the Church of Santa Lucia, he stopped for a moment to ask about the identity of a pretty girl whom he had just seen in an upper window across the street. He was making the inquiry and saluting two soldiers, who walked by him, when he was attacked from behind by two men who were trailing him.\n\nOne of them knocked the Duke violently and stabbed him deep in the stomach with a triangular blade. Everything happened so fast that Charles initially did not realize what had just transpired and seconds later gasping he said, “My God, I’m done for. They have stabbed me”. In the confusion, the two assailants escaped running in opposite directions and mixing with the crowd.\n\nThe wounded Duke fell on the ground in a pool of blood with the blade still in his stomach. He was lifted up, and held by his arms and legs. He was carried back to the palace. He made no complaints as his doctors treated his wound, which was deep. He asked if they thought his life was in danger.\n\nThey lied assuring him that it was not and he passed out. In moments of lucidity, the Duke, realizing the seriousness of his condition repeated: “I am preparing myself for a long journey”. The Duke received the last rites and was able to see his wife and their children for a last time. After atrocious suffering, which he endured bravely, he died the following evening, March 27 at 5:30 p.m. He was thirty-one years old.\n\nCharles’s body was buried in the Cappella della Macchia near Viareggio. His heart was placed in an urn in the crypt of the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata in Parma.\n\nWhen her husband was murdered Louise Marie Thèrésa served as regent for their young son, the new duke, Robert I. Like the other rulers of the Central Italian states, she and her son were ousted during the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, and they retired to Austrian protection in Venice.\n\nVarious schemes following the war, either for her and her son’s restoration in Parma, or territorial swaps which might leave them ruling over Tuscany, Modena, or the Romagna, came to nothing, as the whole of central Italy was annexed by Piedmont in March 1860. Louise Marie Thèrésa lived out the remainder of her life in exile.\n\nDeath\n\nLouise died on February 1, 1864, aged 44, in the Palazzo Giustinian in Venice. She was buried in her grandfather Charles X’s crypt at the Franciscan monastery Kostanjevica in Görz, Austria (now Nova Gorica, Slovenia).\n\nOther members of the French Royal Family buried there include her brother Henri, Count of Chambord, her aunt Marie Thérèse of France, and her uncle Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême.\n\nLouise Marie Thèrésa had been described at that time as a pretty blonde, fair complexioned with golden hair and blue eyes, but not very tall. She was reserved, cold, insensitive and lacked charm.\n\nHer son, Robert I, Duke of Parma, (July 9, 1848 – November 16, 1907): married his cousin Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies on April 5, 1869. She was the daughter of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and his wife, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, the eldest daughter of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Luisa of Spain. Her maternal grandparents were Friedrich Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg and his wife Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg.\n\nRobert I, Duke of Parma, and Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies had twelve children.\n\nDuke Robert remarried Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal on October 1884, daughter of the deposed King Miguel I of Portugal and his wife, Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Maria Antonia was his second cousin once removed, as her paternal grandmother (Charlotte of Spain) and Robert’s paternal great-grandmother (Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain) were siblings, both being children of Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma.\n\nDuke Robert and Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal also had twelve children.\n\nPrincess Zita of Bourbon-Parma was the seventeenth child of Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his second wife, Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, and thus a granddaughter of Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa d’Artois, Duchess of Parma.\n\nPrincess Zita married the then Archduke Charles of Austria in 1911. Charles became heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary in 1914 after the assassination of his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and acceded to the throne in 1916 after the elderly emperor’s death.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1832, King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, brother of Carolina of the Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry, had proposed to marry his younger brother, Prince Antonio, Count of Lecce who was 16 years old, to Louise Marie Thérèse d’Artois who was then 13. The plans fizzled.\n\nPrince Antonio quickly became known for his restless behavior. By age sixteen in 1832, he was already a consummate womanizer. The marriage negotiation failed as Princess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême opposed the union.\n\nPrincess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême also discarded the idea of marrying her niece to any Austrian Archduke. She was adamant that Louise Marie Thèrésa should marry a Bourbon. As there were very few princes to choose from, Louise Marie Thèrésa reached twenty-five still unmarried and at an advanced age for a single Princess of her time.\n\nFinally in 1845, Princess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême arranged her marriage to Hereditary Prince Charles Louis of Lucca, the future Duke Charles III of Parma.\n\nA few years younger than Louise Marie Thèrésa, Charles Louis used to spend some summers near Froshdorf and they had met when they were still children.\n\nCharles III, Duke of Parma, was born at the Villa delle Pianore near Lucca on 14 January 1823, the only son of Charles Louis, Prince of Lucca, (later Duke of Lucca, and Duke Charles II of Parma) and his wife Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy (daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and his wife, Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este herself the daughter of the daughter of Archduke Ferdinand Charles of Austria-Este, and Maria Beatrice d’Este, Duchess of Massa.\n\nHe was given the baptismal names Ferdinand Charles Victor Joseph Maria Baldassarre. Until his accession as Duke of Parma in 1849, he was called Ferdinand Charles or Ferdinand. His family called him Danduccio.\n\nAt the death of his grandmother, Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca, on March 13, 1824, Ferdinand Charles became the Hereditary Prince of Lucca.\n\nHereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca, the future Duke Charles III of Parma was a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian Dynasty and earlier a descendent of the Robertians.\n\nDuke Charles III’s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.\n\nOn November 10, 1845, at Schloss Frohsdorf in Austria, Louise Marie Thèrésa married Hereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca.\n\nThe Duchy of Lucca was incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and she and her husband became known as Hereditary Prince and Hereditary Princess of Parma.\n\nIn December 1847, at the death of Empress Marie Louise, his father became the reigning Duke Charles II of Parma. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill-received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution.\n\nEmpress Marie Louise was the eldest child of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. She was also the second wife of was Napoleon Bonaparte , Emperor of the French, and as such was the Empress of the French and Queen of Italy from their marriage on April 1, 1810 until his abdication on April 6, 1814.\n\nIn August 1848 the Austrian army entered Parma, and officially restored Duke Charles II. Ferdinand Charles and his wife Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa and family, however, remained in England, since hostilities continued between the Austrian and Piedmontese armies. For several years Charles II had considered abdicating in favor of Ferdinand Charles, but he delayed in the hope that when he did so things would be more secure for his son.\n\nOn April 9, the regency transformed into a provisional government. Only four months after regaining the throne of his ancestors, Charles II was forced to flee from Italy, finding refuge in the castle of Weistropp in Saxony. On April 19, 1848, Charles abdicated in favor of his son, living in exile in Great Britain.\n\nDuke Charles III owed his throne to the support of Austrian troops. He placed Parma under martial law, inflicted heavy penalties on the members of the late provisional government, closed the university, and instituted a regular policy of persecution. His authoritarian policies made him unpopular.\n\nHis arbitrary decisions destroyed the respect that his subjects had for him and his dynasty and he became unpopular. By 1853 there were rumors of plots to remove him from power.\n\nHis personal life was also in turmoil. He grew apart from his wife, Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa, Duchess of Parma who became exceedingly fat. The Duchess was a sharp-tongued woman who liked having her way through intrigues and the force of her personality.\n\nThe rift between husband and wife grew when Charles III openly began an affair with Countess Emma Guadagni (1829–1866), a sister-in-law of the Austrian general governor of Trento. They met in Florence in February 1852, while Charles III was a guest of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nIn a semi-official visit to Queen Isabella II of Spain in December 1853, Charles III took his mistress with him, bringing about the final breakdown of his marriage. In mid February 1854, Charles III returned to Parma.\n\nChristian the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (September 20, 1599 – June 16, 1626), a member of the House of Welf, titular Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt, was a German Protestant military leader during the early years of the Thirty Years’ War, fighting against the forces of the Imperial House of Habsburg, Royal Habsburg Spain, and the Catholic League.\n\nChristian was born in 1599 at the Gröningen Priory near Halberstadt (in today’s Saxony-Anhalt), the third son of Duke Heinrich Julius of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1564–1613) with his second wife Elisabeth of Denmark and Norway (1573–1625), who was the eldest daughter of the late King Frederik II of Denmark and his spouse Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, the daughter of Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Elizabeth of Denmark, the elder daughter of King Frederik I of Denmark and his second spouse Sophie of Pomerania.\n\nScottish ambassadors had at first concentrated their suit on Elisabeth of Denmark as a prospective wife for King James VI of Scotland, but King Frederik II betrothed Elisabeth to Duke Christian of Brunswick-Lüneburg, promising the Scots instead that “for the second daughter Anne, if the King did like her, he should have her”. King James VI of Scotland eventually married King Frederik II’s second daughter Anne in a proxy ceremony in Copenhagen in August 1589.\n\nThere were also other suitors for the princess. In addition to James VI of Scotland, Archduke Matthias of Austria (later Emperor Matthias) also had plans for a marriage to her, and during a visit to Denmark in February 1587, he had spoken to King Frederik II of Denmark about this, but nothing came of it, unknown for what reason. Presumably there have been religious concerns about this.\n\nPrince Heinrich Julius was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg as well as the ruling Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel from 1589 until his death. He also served as administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt from 1566 and of the Prince-Bishopric of Minden between 1582 and 1585. Duke Heinrich Julius died on 30, July 1613.\n\nAfter his father’s death, the new Duke Christian of Brunswick-Lüneburg was educated by his maternal uncle, King Christian IV of Denmark, and attended the University of Helmstedt.\n\nAfter the death of his brother Rudolph in 1616, Christian, at the age of 17, was elected his successor as Lutheran administrator of the Halberstadt bishopric. Though he did not obtain any confirmation by Emperor Ferdinand II or the Catholic Church, this position provided him the necessary finances to start a military career.\n\nIn 1620 Christian joined the army of Prince Maurice of Orange and fought in the Netherlands against a Spanish army. Later he raised his own army and, in liege to Friedrich V, Prince-Elector Palatine of the Rhine he carried out three significant battles: the Battle of Höchst (1622), the Battle of Fleurus (1622), and lastly at the Battle of Stadtlohn (1623).\n\nDuke Christian participated in a number of plunderings and burnings along the France-Holy Roman Empire border and throughout the Netherlands. Christian fought alongside the Count of Mansfeld in the first two engagements, and suffered two losses to the Count of Tilly: an arguable one at Höchst, and his final one at Stadtlohn.\n\nChristian’s major success was at Fleurus, where his actions directly led to the relieving of the Protestant stronghold of Bergen op Zoom.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years War there was a plan that involved Duke Christian, Count of Mansfeld, and King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway, pushing from the United Provinces and from Denmark-Norway, Duke Christian found himself with ample financial backing.\n\nOrdered to advance on the Rhineland, he undertook this mission but quickly found himself checked by Tilly in Hesse, and opted this time to retreat rather than fight. Ill from the outset of the campaign, he died childless from wounds sustained in battle at Wolfenbüttel on June 16, 1626 at the age of 26.\n\nThough both England and Scotland recognised Anne as their queen, only the Parliament of England had settled on Sophia, Princess-Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive. The Parliament of Scotland (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession question for the Scottish throne.\n\nIn 1703, the Estates passed a bill declaring that their selection for Queen Anne’s successor would not be the same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies.\n\nAt first Royal Assent was withheld, but the following year Queen Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the Act of Security 1704.\n\nIn response the English Parliament passed the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession.\n\nEventually, in 1707, both Parliaments agreed on a Treaty of Union, which united England and Scotland into a single political entity, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and established the rules of succession as laid down by the Act of Settlement 1701. The union created the largest free trade area in 18th-century Europe.\n\nWhig politicians believed Parliament had the right to determine the succession, and to bestow it on the nearest Protestant relative of the Queen, while many Tories were more inclined to believe in the hereditary right of the Catholic Stuarts, who were nearer relations.\n\nIn 1710, George announced that he would succeed in Britain by hereditary right, as the right had been removed from the Stuarts, and he retained it. “This declaration was meant to scotch any Whig interpretation that Parliament had given him the kingdom [and] … convince the Tories that he was no usurper.”\n\nGeorge’s mother, the Princess-Electress Sophia, died on May 28, 1714 at the age of 83. She had collapsed in the gardens at Herrenhausen after rushing to shelter from a shower of rain. Prince-Elector George Louis of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, was now Queen Anne’s heir presumptive.\n\nHe swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council that would take power after Queen Anne’s death, as it was known that Anne’s health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power.\n\nShe suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak, and died on August 1, 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and George was proclaimed King of Great Britain and King of Ireland.\n\nPartly due to contrary winds, which kept him in The Hague awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until September 18. George was crowned at Westminster Abbey on October 20. His coronation was accompanied by rioting in over twenty towns in England.\n\nJacobites attempted, but failed, to depose George and replace him with James Francis Edward Stuart, Anne’s Catholic half-brother.\n\nDuring George’s reign the powers of the monarchy diminished, and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister.\n\nTowards the end of his reign, actual political power was held by Robert Walpole, now recognised as Britain’s first de facto Prime Minister. King George I died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried. He is the most recent British monarch to be buried outside the United Kingdom.\n\nGeorge I (May 28, 1660 – June 11, 1727) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from August 1, 1714 and ruler of the Prince-Electorate of Hanover within the Holy Roman Empire from January 23, 1698 until his death in 1727. He was the first British monarch of the House of Hanover as the most senior Protestant descendant of his great-grandfather James VI and I.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrince George Louis of Brunswick-Lüneburg was born on May 28, 1660 in the city of Hanover in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in the Holy Roman Empire. He was the eldest son of Ernst August, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and his wife, Sophia of the Palatinate of the Rhine, born a princess to Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate of the Rhine and his wife, Princess Elizabeth of England and Scotland the daughter of King James I-VI of England, Scotland and Ireland. This gave George a distant claim to the the English, Irish and Scottish crowns.\n\nIn 1679 another uncle died unexpectedly without sons, and Ernst August became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, with his capital at Hanover. George’s surviving uncle, Georg Wilhelm of Brunswick-Celle had married his mistress, Eléonore Desmier d’Olbreuse (1639–1722), Lady of Harburg, a French Huguenot noblewoman, in order to legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Sophia Dorothea of Brunswick-Celle appears to have grown up in a carefree and loving environment.\n\nUnder Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682 the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory and not have to share it with his brothers.\n\nIn December 1680 Prince George of Brunswick-Lüneburg arrived in London for a three month visit, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between George and his cousin the future Queen Anne. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle as part of a scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance.\n\nGeorge married Sophia Dorothea of Brunswick-Celle thereby securing additional incomes that would have been outside Salic laws. This marriage of state was arranged primarily to ensure a healthy annual income, and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle.\n\nHis mother at first opposed the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea’s mother, Eleonore (who came from lower nobility), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea’s legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.\n\nPrior to the marriage to Prince George of Hanover, Sophia Dorothea’s suitors included August Friedrich, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel; Friedrich Charles, Duke of Württemberg-Winnental; Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria; and King Cark XI of Sweden.\n\nAt first, her parents agreed to marriage between Sophia Dorothea and the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who was the eldest son of their distant relative Anthon Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who had supported the love affair between Georg Wilhelm and Éléonore from its beginning. The betrothal was signed on December 20, 1675, but the prospective groom was mortally wounded at the siege of Philippsburg on August 9, 1676.\n\nElevation of birth status and marriage\n\nAfter the death of his daughter’s fiancé, Georg Wilhelm sought to negotiate an agreement on the inheritance of the Duchy of Lüneburg. He initially approached his younger brother Ernst August, Prince-Elector of Hanover and Brunswick-Lüneburg, to arrange a marriage between Sophia Dorothea and Ernst August’s eldest son George Louis, the future King George I of Great Britain. However, both his brother and his sister-in-law, Sophia of the Palatinate of the Rhine, had misgivings about the proposed match because of the circumstances of Sophia Dorothea’s birth.\n\nAfter the rejection of his daughter, Georg Wilhelm decided to improve the status of Sophia Dorothea and her mother. By contract signed on August 22, 1675, and in open violation of his previous promise never to marry, Georg Wilhelm declared that Éléonore was his lawful wife, and a second wedding ceremony was held at Celle on April 2, 1676. Ernst August and Sophia stayed away from this second wedding. Twenty-two days later, on April 24, Eléonore began to be addressed at court as Duchess of Brunswick and Sophia Dorothea became legitimate.\n\nAlbrecht IV of Austria (September 19, 1377 – September 14, 1404) was a Duke of Austria.\n\nAlbrecht IV of Austria was born in Vienna, the son of Duke Albrecht III of Austria and Beatrix of Nuremberg, a member of the House of Hohenzollern and a daughter of Friedrich V, Burgrave of Nuremberg and his wife Elisabeth of Meissen (a Saxony Princess of the House of Wettin).\n\nHe was the Duke of Austria from 1395 until 1404, which then included roughly today’s Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria, as the other Habsburg dominions were at that time ruled by his relatives of the Leopoldinian Line of the family. Albrecht’s rule was characterized by quarrels with that part of his family and with members of the Luxemburg dynasty, Wenceslaus of Luxembourg and Sigismund of Luxembourg.\n\nWenceslaus was King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia from 1378 until his death and King of Germany/King of the Romans from 1376 until he was deposed in 1400. As he belonged to the House of Luxembourg, he was also Duke of Luxembourg from 1383 to 1388. Wenceslaus never held the title of Emperor.\n\nSigismund of Luxembourg was a monarch as King of Hungary and Croatia (jure uxoris) from 1387, King of Germany/Romans from 1410, King of Bohemia from 1419, and Holy Roman Emperor from 1433 until his death in 1437, as well as Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (1378–1388 and 1411–1415). He was the last male member of the House of Luxembourg.\n\nDuke Albrecht IV of Austria died at Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria, in 1404. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in the Stephansdom in Vienna. He was succeeded by his son as Duke Albrecht V of Austria.\n\nThrough his maternal grandmother, Elisabeth of Meissen, Albrecht IV descended from Babenberg Dukes of Austria.\n\nElisabeth of Meissen was the daughter of Friedrich II, Margrave of Meissen and Mathilde of Bavaria.\n\nThe House of Babenberg was a noble dynasty of Austrian Dukes and Margraves. Originally from Bamberg in the Duchy of Franconia (present-day Bavaria), the Babenbergs ruled the imperial Margraviate of Austria from its creation in 976 AD until its elevation to a duchy in 1156, and from then until the extinction of the line in 1246, whereafter they were succeeded by the House of Habsburg, to which they were related.\n\nThe male line of the Babenbergs became extinct in 1246, when Due Friedrich II of Austria was killed in battle (the Henneberg branch of the Franconian Babenbergs lived on until 1583 when its lands were divided among the two branches of the Wettin family).\n\nFriedrich’s heir general was Gertrude of Austria, the only child of his late elder brother, Heinrich of Austria by that man’s wife, Agnes of Thuringia. However, neither her husbands nor her son succeeded in settling the Babenberg inheritance under their power. Gertrude’s only surviving child, Agnes of Baden, tried to reclaim at least part of her inheritance through her third husband Ulrich II of Heunburg, but was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter some years of struggle known as the Austrian Interregnum, or War of the Babenberg Succession (1246–1256/78/82), the Duchies of Austria and Styria fell to King Ottokar II of Bohemia and then to Count Rudolph I of Habsburg and later German King.\n\nCount Rudolph I (May 1, 1218 – July 15, 1291) was the first King of Germany/King of the Romans from the House of Habsburg. The first of the count-kings of Germany, he reigned from 1273 until his death.\n\nRudolph’s election as King marked the end of the Great Interregnum which had begun after the death of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Friedrich II in 1250. Originally a Swabian count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of Austria and Styria in opposition to his mighty rival, the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld.\n\nThe Austrian territories remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the Habsburg monarchy and the present-day country of Austria. Rudolph played a vital role in raising the comital House of Habsburg to the rank of Imperial princes.\n\nDuke Leopold V of Austria, a member of the House of Babenberg and he was known for his involvement in the Third Crusade where he fought in the Siege of Acre in 1191 and of his imprisonment of King Richard of England I in 1193 at Dürnstein Castle.\n\nFamily and children\n\nDuke Albrecht IV of Austria was married in Vienna April 24, 1390 to Joanna Sophia of Bavaria, daughter of Albrecht I, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing and Margarete of Brieg. Their children were:\n\n1. Margarete (1395 – 1447), married in Landshut 25 November 1412 to Duke Heinrich XVI of Bavaria.\n\n2. Duke Albrecht V (1397–1439).\n\nBefore discussing the next heir to the Russian Throne after the fall of the monarchy I’d like to address the Pauline Laws that governed, or still govern, the succession to the Imperial Throne.\n\nThe Pauline Laws are the house laws of the Romanov rulers of the Russian Empire. The name comes from the fact that they were initially established by Emperor Paul I of Russia in 1797.\n\nEmperor Paul I abolished Emperor Peter I the Great’s law that allowed each reigning Emperor or Empress to designate his or her successor and substituted a strict order of succession by proclaiming that the eldest son of the monarch would inherit the throne, followed by other dynasts according to primogeniture in the male line.\n\nPaul thus implemented a semi-Salic line of succession to the Russian throne, which would pass to a female and through the female (cognatic) line of the dynasty only upon the extinction of all legitimately-born male dynasts (in this case, only the descendants of Paul I himself, not the Holstein-Gottorp line which were 3rd cousins).\n\nThe House of Holstein-Gottorp or Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp is the historiographical name, as well as contemporary shorthand name, for the parts of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, also known as Ducal Holstein, that were ruled by the dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, a side branch of the elder Danish line of the House of Oldenburg. Other parts of the duchies were ruled by the kings of Denmark.\n\nIn the Great Northern War, the duchy sided with Sweden and was defeated after Danish troops occupied the northern portions of Holstein-Gottorp. Following the peace settlement of 1721, Duke Charles Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp fled to the court of Emperor Peter the Great of Russia, and for some time, the Russians intrigued to restore Charles Friedrich to his lands in Schleswig.\n\nCharles Friedrich himself was married to Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, Peter’s daughter. From his marriage was born Charles Peter Ulrich, who succeeded to Holstein-Gottorp in 1739, and became an heir to the Russian throne according to the will of Empress Catherine I and especially upon the accession of his childless aunt Empress Elizabeth in 1741. As such, Charles Friedrich is the progenitor of the Russian imperial House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov and the patrilineal ancestor of all Russian emperors starting with Peter III, except for Catherine II the Great.\n\nCharles Peter Ulrich, acceded to the Russian throne as Emperor Peter III in 1762, his wife was Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg. Her mother was Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Her father, Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, belonged to the ruling German family of Anhalt. In a coup orchestrated by Peter III’s by his wife, he was overthrown in 1762 and his wife acceded to the throne as Empress Catherine II. Peter III’s son, Paul, the new Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, was a minor under the regency of his mother, the Empress.\n\nOfficially, Paul he was the only son of Peter III and Catherine II the Great, although Catherine hinted that he was fathered by her lover Sergei Saltykov.\n\nAll subsequent Russian Emperors were also Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp until the end of the Russian Monarchy.\n\nThe next two claimants were:\n\n1918–1938: Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia (After the murder of the Emperor and the Tsarevitch in 1918, the title passed to the surviving senior male branch of the Romanov family).\n\n1938–1992: Vladimir Kirillovich, Grand Duke of Russia (Grand Duke Vladimir died with only female issue, and so the title should pass to the senior male member of the House of Romanov-Holstein-Gottorp. To whom is a contested issue)\n\nOne view is that the heir to the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp is the non-dynastic son of Grand Duke Dimitri, only son of Grand Duke Paul, himself the youngest brother of Alexander III. This heir is non-dynastic in the Russian sense, of the Pauline Laws but the Danish branch of the House of Oldenburg had no declared ban against unequal marriages (but against non authorized marriages in Denmark), as Schleswig, where the (once sovereign) Schloss Gottorf is located, was never part of Holy Roman Empire or under its jurisdiction. These heirs live in USA and have not staked a public claim to titles.\n\nThat brings me to the next aspect of the Pauline Laws, namely to be a dynast and eligible to be in line for the Imperial Throne one had to be the offspring of an equal marriage.\n\nA “dynastic marriage” is one that complies with monarchical house law restrictions, so that the descendants are eligible to inherit the throne or other royal privileges.\n\nTo be considered the offspring of an equal marriage both parents need to be from an aristocratic family that is of equal social status, or rank, meaning from a princely or royal family or a mediatized family.\n\nThe type of marriage or a union that is not considered of equal social status, is called a Morganatic Marriage which in the context of royalty or other inherited title prevents the principal’s position or privileges being passed to the spouse, or any children born of the marriage. The concept is most prevalent in German-speaking territories and countries most influenced by the customs of the German-speaking realms.\n\nWith Emperor Paul coming from German royalty the concept of a Morganatic Marriage and its effect on dynastic marriages became part of the rules controlling the succession to the Imperial Throne with the implementation of the Pauline Laws. However, even Morganatic Marriages were eventually eliminated from the Pauline Laws.\n\nOver time, the house laws were amended, and in the late Russian Empire, the laws governing membership in the imperial house, succession to the throne and other dynastic subjects were divided, with some being included in the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire and others in the Statute of the Imperial Family (codification of 1906, as amended to 1911).\n\nIn 1820 a new law also stipulated that only children of Romanovs born of marriages with persons of equal status, i.e., members of a “royal or sovereign family”, could transmit succession rights and titles to descendants.\n\nEmperor Alexander III forbade Romanov morganatic marriages altogether by issuance of ukase #5868 on March 24, 1889 amending article #63 of the Statute on the Imperial Family in the Pauline Laws.\n\nBy ukase #35731, dated August 11, 1911, Emperor Nicholas II amended the amendment, reducing application of this restriction from all members of the Imperial Family to Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses only.\n\nThis decree allowed marriages of the princes and princesses of the Blood Imperial with non-royal spouses, on the conditions that the emperor’s consent be obtained, that the dynast renounce his or her personal succession rights, and that the Pauline Laws aws restricting succession rights to those born of equal marriages continue in force.\n\nAn early victim of the Pauline laws was Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, grandson of Catherine the Great, and viceroy of Poland. On 20 March 1820 his marriage to Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was annulled to allow him to morganatically wed his longtime mistress, Countess Joanna Grudna-Grudzińska, in Warsaw on May 24, 1820, who was elevated to the title “Princess Łowicza” upon marriage, which produced no children.\n\nThe problem with the Pauline Laws today is the fact that since the monarchy was abolished at the end of the Russian Revolution they have been unable to be legally amended or replaced. This has caused a considerable amount of confusion and controversy in deciding who is or is not a dynast or the legal heir to the vacant Imperial throne."
