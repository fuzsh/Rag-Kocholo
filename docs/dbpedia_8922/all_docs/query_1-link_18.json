In 1692, in return for lavish promises of assistance to the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburgs, the emperor Leopold I granted him the rank and title of elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg (i.e., Hanover), which became the ninth electorate of the empire. Indignant protests followed this proceeding. A league was formed to prevent any addition to the electoral college; France and Sweden were called upon for assistance. This agitation, however, soon died away, and his son was confirmed as elector by the imperial diet.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFit for a King (or Queen): the British Royalty Quiz\n\nErnest Augustus took a step of great importance in the history of Hanover and Great Britain when, in 1658, he married Sophia, daughter of the elector palatine Frederick V and granddaughter of James I of Great Britain; for their son became, by the terms of the Act of Settlement of 1701, king of Great Britain and Ireland in 1714.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
