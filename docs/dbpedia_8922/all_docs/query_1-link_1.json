        "text": "The Duchy of Brunswick (German: Herzogtum Braunschweig) is a small duchy located in the continental Europe and holds territories throughout the rest of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. It is a duchy within the heart of Germany.\n\nThe Duchy of Brunswick is a constitutional monarchy. It is governed by the Duchess of Brunswick and her Ministerial Cabinet at the seat of government in Braunschweig, the capital. The Duchess and her Ministerial Cabinet are kept in check by the People's Council of Brunswick, who also meet in the capital. The Duchy’s government is described in detail within the Constitution of the Duchy of Brunswick.\n\nIt is a member state of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons and a former member state of the German Empire, the Republic of Aquisgrana, Nueva Vida, and Colossus.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPower had been held by several competing members of the Welf family since the 13th century. These family members were rulers of several territories in the northwestern sector of Germany. The territories were neither compact nor indivisible so when in the event a family lost power or their line went extinct, the lands were divvied up between the remaining members. What unified this ruling class was the fact they were governed by male-line descendants of Duke Otto I.\n\nIt took several divisions to result in the unification of Brunswick-Lüneburg under Duke Magnus II. Upon the death of Magnus II, his three sons controlled the duchy. When one of the three brothers was murdered, the two brothers divided the land and one brother, named Henry, receied Wolfenbüttel. Power changed hands between the House of Brunswick, House of Dannenberg, and the House of Brunswick-Bevern until the Congress of Vienna recognized the Duchy as a sovereign state in 1815. The House of Brunswick-Dannenberg assumed power after this declaration and held power over the Duchy until 1884.\n\nThe Duchy of Brunswick was established on February 28, 2009, and crowned Princess Victoria as the Duchess of Brunswick.
