        "text": "Fredericton’s history dates back thousands of years. Originally home to the Wolastoqiyik People, the French and British followed. Today, newcomers from around the world are arriving to call this scenic bend on the river home.\n\nLong before the founding of Fredericton in the 1780’s, the Wolastoqey (Maliseet) and Mi’kmaq peoples made the region a seasonal stop for hunting, fishing and farming.\n\nThe land continues to be part of the traditional Wolastoqey territory, as recognized in treaties to establish an ongoing relationship of peace, friendship and mutual respect between equal nations.\n\nFrench fur traders arrived in 1692, establishing Fort Nashwaak, where the Nashwaak River and the Wolastoq (Saint John River) meet. In 1732, French Acadians fleeing from the British expulsion, formed another settlement called St. Anne’s Point. This community was located near the site of the current Government House.\n\nIn 1783, United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution arrived at St. Anne’s Point. In 1784, the Province of New Brunswick was formed separate and apart from Nova Scotia.\n\nOn April 25, 1785 Governor Thomas Carleton wrote to the colonial minister recommending St. Anne’s Point become the capital of New Brunswick and be given the name of Frederick’s Town, in honour of Prince Frederick, Duke of York, second son of King George III and Queen Charlotte. The name was soon shorted to Fredericton.\n\nIn 1845, although the population of Fredericton was not large enough to be a considered a city, Queen Victoria made Fredericton a Cathedral City, so Christ Church Cathedral could be built. Fredericton was incorporated as a city on March 30, 1848, by an Act of the Provincial Legislature.\n\nThe community continued to thrive and serve as home to several military regiments. The Infantry School Corps (later the Royal Canadian Regiment) was born here in 1883.\n\nThe city became a centre for industry, education and culture. It also grew, both in size and population.\n\nIn 1945, the community of Devon (originally known as Gibson), was amalgamated into Fredericton.\n\nIn 1973, Fredericton’s population and area doubled with the amalgamation of several communities. This included Nashwaaksis, Marysville,\n\nBarker’s Point, Silverwood, and parts of Douglas and Lincoln.\n\nIn 2023, as part of Local Governance Reform in the province, Fredericton grew again by an estimated 4,300 people and a land mass of 48% to include the surrounding communities of Saint Mary’s, Douglas, Pepper Creek, Estey’s Bridge, as well as part of Lincoln.\n\nToday, in addition to being a centre for government and education, Fredericton is home to the largest concentration of knowledge-based businesses in the province and is one of the fastest growing cities in Atlantic Canada.\n\nImage\n\nThe City of Fredericton has had a long association with its namesake ship, His Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS) Fredericton. There have been two vessels named Fredericton in the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\nThe first, HMCS Fredericton (K245) was a Flower Class corvette and was commissioned on December 8, 1941 at Sorel, QC. She served during World War II in several capacities and locations. After undergoing a major refit, she spent the remainder of the war as an ocean escort. She was sold in 1948.\n\nThe second, HMCS Fredericton (337) is a Halifax Class frigate and was commissioned on September 10, 1994, in Saint John, NB. She is based in Halifax, NS and has carried out various missions on behalf of the Canadian Forces. She underwent a refit in 2004 and continues to conduct operations in support of Canada’s domestic and international policies.\n\nImage\n\nThe Ship’s badge features a Bengal tiger, on a field of green representing the forests of New Brunswick. straddling a wavy blue line representative of the Wolastoq (Saint John River), which divides the City of Fredericton in half. The ship’s motto is “Stalker of the Seas.”\n\nFor more, visit the HMCS Fredericton page"
