        "text": "Our original heritage.\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the region for thousands of years; the Mi’gmaq in northern and eastern New Brunswick, the Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) along the Saint John River Valley, and the Peskotomuhkatiyik (Passamaquoddy) in the St. Croix River watershed. The three nations are part of the Wabanaki Confederacy, which also includes the Penobscot and Abenaki nations of Maine. Wabanaki, meaning \"Land of the Dawn”, designates a large area including Maine and the Maritime provinces.\n\nThe 15 First Nations communities in New Brunswick are a vital part of our heritage. There are more Indigenous names used for rivers, towns, and other landmarks in New Brunswick than in any of the other Atlantic provinces. For example, Madawaska comes from a Wolastoqey word meaning “land of the porcupines”, Escuminac was a look-out place in the Mi’gmaw language, and Shippagan comes from the Mi’gmaw word Sepaguncheech, meaning “duck road”.\n\nFor a unique look at each First Nation, you can attend one of the many powwows taking place during the summer. Everyone’s welcome to join in those celebrations of songs, dances, ceremonies, and vendors with authentic food, artwork and crafts.\n\nExperiences at Kouchibouguac National Park, Metepenagiag Heritage Park, Elsipogtog First Nation, Red Bank Lodge and with SP First Nations Outdoor Tours or Wabanaki Tree Spirit offer the opportunity to sample traditional food, participate in a craft workshop or smudging ceremony, listen to aboriginal stories and folklore, or even sleep in a teepee."
