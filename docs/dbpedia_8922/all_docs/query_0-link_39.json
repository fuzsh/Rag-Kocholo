        "text": "The founder of the claim on the domain of Braunschweig was Henry the Lion from the House of the Guelphs. In 1142 the he received the city of Braunschweig and the Duchy of Saxony as fiefs, and the latter was greatly enlarged in the years that followed as a result of an intensive colonization to the east. He chose the city of Braunschweig as the center of his domain, which he had converted into his residence. After Henry the Lion was appointed duke of Bavaria in 1154, he was considered one of the most powerful princes in the Holy Empire. When a conflict between Henry and the Emperor Barbarossa came to a head in 1180, the Reichsacht (Imperial Ban) was finally imposed on Henry. Following the subsequent army tour against Henry, he was left only the possession of the cities of Braunschweig and Lüneburg as well as some smaller inherited property (allodial property).\n\nOnly the grandson of Henry the Lion, Otto I the Child, was able to partially restore the lost influence. In the course of the Hohenstaufen-Welf reconciliation, he transferred his rights to Emperor Frederick II in 1235. In return, the Duchy of Braunschweig-Lüneburg was founded from the transferred goods and other large territories of the empire, and Otto was enfeoffed\n\nAs early as 1269, the Duchy was divided into individual principalities. In the southern part of the Duchy, the Principality of Braunschweig with possessions around Braunschweig, Wolfenbüttel, Einbeck and Göttingen was established. In the northern part of the Duchy, the Principality of Lüneburg was founded with properties in the Lüneburg area. Both principalities, however, continued to form the Duchy of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, which thus continued to exist undivided under imperial law. It was also a hallmark of continued existence that all the princes and male princes of the various lines bore the title \"Duke of Braunschweig and Lüneburg\". In the further history there were still several divisions within the Duchy and its principalities, from which the Principality of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel also emerged in 1291. This remained largely unchanged and became the predecessor of the Duchy of Braunschweig. The other principalities gradually merged again until the Electorate of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, better known as the Electorate of Hanover, was established in 1692.\n\nAll these principalities were crushed by the Napoleonic campaigns against Prussia and the subsequent peace of Tilsit. By decree, Napoléon Bonaparte founded the Kingdom of Westphalia, to which the various Braunschweig and Hanoverian possessions were subordinated. This division was only reversed at the Congress of Vienna after the defeat of Napoleonic France. Thus, on 8 June 1815, the German Confederation was initially founded as the successor organization to the Holy Roman Empire. Member States included the Kingdom of Hanover and the Duchy of Braunschweig.\n\nIn 1813 Duke Friedrich Wilhelm was restituted. After the Vienna Congress, the Duchy of Braunschweig was established in 1814 in the old borders of the Principality of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel. During the congress, efforts were still being made on the Brunswick side to incorporate parts of the former prince-bishopric of Hildesheim into the Brunswick territory. The Dukes of Wolfenbüttel ruled these areas as early as the 16th and 17th centuries, and such an increase could have ended the territorial fragmentation of the state. But that was opposed by the interests of Prussia and above all Hanover. The entire Hildesheim area finally came to the Kingdom of Hanover.\n\nAfter Friedrich Wilhelm's death in 1815, he was succeeded by eleven-year-old Charles II as Duke of Braunschweig. Until Karl's legal age in 1823, however, his uncle, George IV of Great Britain and Hanover, reigned. In 1830 unemployment, hunger and great dissatisfaction prevailed in the state of Braunschweig after a failed harvest. Charles II had long been upset by his clumsy style of government and his absolutist demeanor, which culminated in a popular uprising under the impression of the July Revolution in France: the aforementioned Graue Hof was stormed by petty bourgeoisie, artisans and workers in 1830 and urned down. Karl II had to flee to Switzerland - in his luggage works of art of inestimable value. In Braunschweig, law and order could only be maintained by the vigilante founded by Councilor Wilhelm Bode. The absent Duke Karl II was declared incapable of governing.\n\nThe regency was transferred to his younger brother Wilhelm (who was the last member of the Welfish Line). On1 12 October 1832, the New Landscape Ordinance (Landsschaftsordnung) was enacted, a hereditary monarchist representative state constitution with one chamber and a fixed budget for the ruling prince of 230,900 thalers. Under this unmarried ruler, Braunschweig went through a phase of neutrality as a small state that was not allied with Austria or Prussia. The country formed a tax union with Hanover in 1834 as a customs union, but joined the German customs union in 1841. With the founding of the Reich in 1871, the Duchy became a federal state of the German Empire."
