        "text": "The DAISY Foundation was established in 1999, after the death of J. Patrick Barnes. Patrick died of ITP (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura) so DAISY is an acronym for Diseases Attacking the Immune System. During Pat's eight-week hospitalization, he and his family were awestruck by the care and compassion his nurses provided not only to Pat, but also to everyone in his family.\n\nThe DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses was created by the Barnes family as a way to say thank you to nurses around the country. They believe nurses are truly \"unsung heroes.\"\n\nPresbyterian Hospital has chosen to partner with the DAISY Foundation because we believe it is extremely important to recognize the wonderful work our nurses do every day. We believe the DAISY Award honorees personify Presbyterian's goal to provide each patient with an exceptional experience. These nurses demonstrate excellence through their clinical expertise and extraordinary compassionate care. They consistently put people first, focusing on the \"whole\" patient - body, mind and spirit. These nurses strive for high performance through excellence, innovation, teamwork and trust."
