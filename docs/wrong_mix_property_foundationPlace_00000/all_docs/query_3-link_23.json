Michelle Lujan Grisham. “This year’s recipients come from every corner of the state, showcasing the immense possibilities of the arts across New Mexico. These artists are musicians, authors, sculptors and designers who push the boundaries of telling stories about the state and their lives through art. I am proud to recognize and show off such talent to the rest of the world.”\n\nIt’s the 49th year for the awards which were created to celebrate the extensive role artists and their work play in New Mexico. This year’s recipients represent not only the extraordinary diversity of New Mexico’s rich cultural traditions, but the depth and generosity such diversity encourages. The artists work in a variety of forms and materials, ranging from visual art to writing to music to sculpture, while the major contributors work tirelessly in their communities to support the arts.\n\nThe artists, musicians, and contributors to the arts who earned the award represent the entire state: Paula Castillo of Belen, J.C.
