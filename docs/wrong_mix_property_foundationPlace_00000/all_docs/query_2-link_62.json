        "text": "Women Special Care\n\nOverall, I am very thankful for everyone who was involved with my care. Being UNM ER, I've been in ER with family and I see a lot of changes for the better. Other patients were also being tended to. Area was clean, security handled homeless professionally.\n\nUH Endoscopy\n\nEveryone I encountered in pre-op, operating room, and recovery was very kind, patient, and professional. I felt like I was very well cared for by all the nurses, doctors, and other staff.\n\nBehavioral Health\n\nArt therapy gave us something fun to do and it was wonderfully distracting. Music was a big help and I loved the peer groups it makes you feel like you are not the only one who has ever been in this situation and that it can get better.\n\nSRMC Family Practice\n\nJohnelle Montoya is an exceptionally caring and professional PA. She is a treasure. As a PhD prepared nurse and professor, I have a very high standard of patient care. Johnelle always exceeds those standards. We are blessed to have her care for my us\n\nSRMC\n\nAll my doctors from my care team to surgery team, entered my room explained processes and plans, never rushed and always answered questions. Doctors Fotouhie even called to check on me after a week out of hospital to make certain I had all appointment scheduled and to see if I needed anything.\n\nCenter for Development and Disability\n\nThe Doctor interacted with Jayden very well. She gained his trust quickly and he was willing to let her accomplish the physical without any problems. She was very informative and answered questions. I feel like we got excellent care from her."
