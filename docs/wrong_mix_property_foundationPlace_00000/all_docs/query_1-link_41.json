        "text": "ABOUT THE 48 HOUR FILM PROJECT\n\nThe 48 Hour Film Project is:\n\nAn exciting creative weekend\n\nFilmmakers making short films\n\nA global event that happens in more than 100 cities\n\nThe 48 takes place on different weekends in different cities throughout the year. In each city local Film Teams—from beginners to pro's--compete to make a short film in only a weekend! Do you and your friends have what it takes to make a film on the fly?\n\nIt all begins with the Friday night Kickoff event when you and teams in your city draw genres out of a hat and receive the required elements for your film. Then it is off to the races—writing, shooting and editing and doing whatever it takes to submit your short film on Sunday night. The big payoff is seeing your masterpiece in the big screen at a local theater. Every film, both on-time and late, will screen. There is nothing better than seeing your film with an audience and seeing firsthand how they react to your movie.\n\nAt the city awards event, the winning films—as determined by local judges—are announced. More than a dozen awards are given—from Best Acting to Best Directing to the top prize: Best Film."
