        "text": "Goodyear crowned United Autosports driver Filipe Albuquerque with the 2023 Wingfoot Award in Bahrain, the 2023 FIA WEC season-closer.\n\nThe Portuguese driver won the award after an incredibly consistent season, narrowly beating Robert Kubica to take the overall season award.\n\nMeanwhile, Albert Costa from Inter Europol Competition took the top Wingfoot Award prize for the Bapco Energies 8 Hours of Bahrain, with a stint average lap time of 1:56.96, 0.172 quicker than Albuquerque.\n\nThe Wingfoot Award recognises the consistent performance of Goodyear drivers in the FIA WEC. It celebrates the art of maximising performance and executing a consistent pace. After each round, the award is given to the LMP2 driver who achieves the fastest stint average, measuring their average lap time over two consecutive stints.\n\nAs a result of Albuquerque’s Wingfoot Award triumph, his United Autosports team received three sets of Goodyear LMP2 tires for the end-of-season rookie test which took place on Sunday after the race.\n\nThe Wingfoot Award will continue in WEC next season with the exciting arrival of the LMGT3 category which will see Goodyear as the tyre supplier. It will remain the sole supplier for LMP2 in the European Le Mans Series.\n\nThe origins of the Wingfoot\n\nThe idea of speed inspired Goodyear’s selection of the Wingfoot symbol soon after the formation of the company 125 years ago. Goodyear’s Wingfoot symbol is derived from the famous god of mythology known to the ancient Romans as Mercury, and to the Greeks as Hermes. Mercury was known as a swift messenger for all the gods of mythology, making it a perfect fit for Goodyear’s ethos of performance."
