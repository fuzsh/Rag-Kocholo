        "text": "A Microsoft software development hub in northern Virginia will create as many as 1,500 new jobs. It’s a $64 million project supported by a state grant estimated at $22.5 million, and beyond the Microsoft operations, the site plan also includes retail space for engaging directly with customers.\n\nThat customer-engagement component is an important part of the project, according to company officials. Customer feedback is expected to weigh in on and improve technology development. The Reston Town Center development adds to the company’s existing Virginia presence, which also includes corporate locations in Reston and Richmond, plus an enterprise data center in Mecklenburg County.\n\nTerrell Cox, general manager at Microsoft, noted the facility “will allow Microsoft to deliver even more solutions from a region known for its innovation and passion for technology.”\n\n2021 Gold Shovel Awards: The Winning States\n\nTexas (12+ Million Population)\n\nNorth Carolina (8 to 12 Million Population)\n\nMichigan - Manufacturing (8 to 12 Million Population)\n\nArizona (5 to 8 Million Population)\n\nIndiana - Manufacturing (5 to 8 Million Population)\n\nUtah (3 to 5 Million Population)\n\nAlabama - Manufacturing (3 to 5 Million Population)\n\nKansas (Under 3 Million Population)\n\n2021 Silver Shovel Awards\n\n12+ Million Population Category\n\nFlorida\n\n8+ to 12 Million Population Category\n\nGeorgia\n\nOhio\n\nVirginia\n\n5+ to 8 Million Population Category\n\nMissouri\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTennessee\n\n3+ to 5 Million Population Category\n\nArkansas\n\nConnecticut\n\nLouisiana\n\nUnder 3 Million Population Category\n\nIdaho\n\nMississippi\n\nSlideshowTop 2020 Projects By State\n\n2021 Gold & Silver Shovel Awards: Projects Of The Year (2020)\n\nMANUFACTURING Company City/County # Jobs Inv.
