        "text": "We’re proud to announce that Bohannan Huston has been awarded a Top Workplaces honor by the Albuquerque Journal. BHI ranked #9 in the midsize business category (140-499 employees). In addition, BHI received a special Benefits Award due to our outstanding scores regarding employee benefits.\n\nThe award winners and rankings were formally announced in a special section of The Albuquerque Journal. The list is based solely on employee feedback gathered through a third-party survey several months ago. More than 130 employees participated (a 78% response rate), and we are thankful for the positive feedback! Achieving Top Workplace status is truly an honor — only 55 companies made this year’s list. The survey uniquely measures 15 drivers of engaged cultures that are critical to the success of any organization including alignment, execution, and connection to name a few.\n\nBHI President/CEO, Bruce Stidworthy, had the following comments about receiving the honor: “We work on great projects, we work with great people, and we have the privilege of making a lasting and positive difference in the communities we serve–for all of those reasons and more, I’ve always known that BHI is a great place to work, but it is really exciting to be independently and formally recognized as a Top Workplace!”\n\nCongratulations to all Top Workplace award winners!"
