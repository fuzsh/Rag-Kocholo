Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Albuquerque Involved are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

If Albuquerque Involved elects to seek arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your membership account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Albuquerque Involved, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). If Albuquerque Involved and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Albuquerque Involved may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Albuquerque Involved or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\n\nYou and Albuquerque Involved agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Albuquerque Involved agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n\nCHOICE OF LAW AND CHOICE OF VENUE\n\nThese Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, U.S.A. without regard to conflict of laws provisions.\n\nIf any provision or provisions of these terms shall be held to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or in conflict with the law of any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and shall remain in full force and effect.\n\nAny dispute claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to your membership in Albuquerque Involved shall be resolved in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement set forth above.
