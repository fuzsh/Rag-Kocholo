They will be recognized during the 37th annual New Mexico Spirit of Achievement Award Dinner at Hotel Albuquerque at Old Town.\n\nThe event will honor the Cinco Amigos: Jason Harrington, William Lang, Steve Maestas, Jerry Roehl, and Kevin Yearout; and Ambassador Ed L. Romero.\n\nSince 1980, National Jewish Health has presented the prestigious Spirit of Achievement Award to citizens in and around Albuquerque who have built a legacy of contributing their time, talents and resources in all areas of life – personal, business and civic – to the community.\n\nThe Spirit of Achievement Award Dinner is an annual mainstay among business, philanthropic and political leaders in the area, and has raised more than $1 million since its inception. The funds raised at the event benefit patients in New Mexico and around the country who receive care from National Jewish Health for respiratory, cardiac, immune and related diseases.\n\nThe chair for the 2019 Spirit of Achievement Award Dinner is Sherman McCorkle. The event committee includes: Harold Albert, Dale Dekker, Joe DiGregorio, Bob Feinberg, Joanne Fine, Harris Hartz, Terry Huertaz, Debbie Johnson, Tom Jones, Lori Lambelet, Georgie Ortiz, and Jim Rogers Jr. Past honoree Pat Vincent-Collawn will be the master of ceremonies.\n\nThe event begins with a reception at 6p.m. with dinner and the award presentation at 7 p.m. Sponsorship opportunities and tickets are still available by calling Janna Fisher at 303.728.6576 or emailing her at FisherJ@njhealth.org.\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation. Founded 125 years ago as a nonprofit hospital, National Jewish Health today is the only facility in the world dedicated exclusively to groundbreaking medical research and treatment of children and adults with respiratory, cardiac, immune and related disorders. Patients and families come to National Jewish Health from around the world to receive cutting-edge, comprehensive, coordinated care. To learn more, visit the media resources page."
