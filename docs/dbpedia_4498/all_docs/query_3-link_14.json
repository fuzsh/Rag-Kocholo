        "text": "Brandon Hobson's remarkable, moving novel, Where the Dead Sit Talking, follows 15-year-old Sequoyah as he becomes the foster child of Harold and Agnes Troutt, a middle-aged couple already fostering 13-year-old George and 17-year-old Rosemary. Sequoyah bonds with Rosemary over their shared Native American heritages—he is Cherokee, she Kiowa. Sequoyah also learns of Harold’s illegal sports bookie business from his foster siblings, and the lure of Harold’s hidden sacks of rolled hundred-dollar bills, tucked safely in a backyard shed, tempt all three children with the possibility for trouble, excess, and freedom. Hobson, a member of the Cherokee Nation Tribe, picks 10 essential Native American novels.\n\nThe 10 essential Native American novels I’ve listed here are in no specific order. I’ve chosen 10 novels I love, but there are plenty of others I would consider essential, many of which are written by the people on this list. While these writers are important to me as a reader, a writer, and as a Cherokee, I should add that there are also many short story collections, books of poetry, and memoirs that represent an active campaign for the traditions and values of Native American culture. And while this list contains such well-established writers as Momaday and Erdrich, there are newer, younger Native American writers out there right now creating amazing works of art—people like Layli Long Soldier, Terese Mailhot, and Tommy Orange, whose names and works will become (are already becoming) a powerful and constructive force in Native American literature."
