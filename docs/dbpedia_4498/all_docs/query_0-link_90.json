        "text": "A boat trip to Dyer Island and surroundings with Marine Dynamic’s expert shark cage diving crew and Marine Biologist researchers is probably your best bet for a once in a lifetime, intimate and enticing encounter with the mysterious Great White Sharks. There are only an estimated 5 000 (or less!) of these endangered Apex predators left in the world.\n\nThe Gansbaai coastline boasts the biggest concentration of Great Whites in a relatively small area. If anyone can show them to you in their natural environment, it is our team . . . If they are around, we will find them! That said, we must admit that we cannot (always) predict or control the weather or the sharks’ moods and daily endeavours. We can, however, guarantee to try our utmost to find them and to give you the ultimate WOW experience of a lifetime!\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the chances of seeing quite a number of Great Whites during our winter months are extremely high. This is also the time when the Southern Right Whales visit our shores to mate, calve and raise their young. On the other hand, the Cape’s winters go hand in hand with wind, rain and stormy weather and this can prevent us from going out to sea. For your own safety, boat trips are dependant on weather conditions and it is advisable to have more than one day set aside for shark viewing.\n\nThe weather in Autumn and Spring is as moody and changeable as the sea and can vary from hot to cold in a day. Since we have a 99% success rate throughout the year with shark viewings, the change of seasons will at most only influence the amount of sharks one encounters during a trip. In perfect conditions, up to 18 sharks have been seen, while the average sightings are 4 to 5 at a time. Never knowing when and where to expect the sharks is part of the adventure. Some of the best sightings have occurred in Autumn – especially when the large (4m+) females arrive in the shallows!\n\nWeather-wise, these summer months are the best for a boat trip at sea in the Gansbaai area! We often have warm, sunny days, clear skies, no wind or rain and nearly perfect sea conditions . . . Ironically, the Great Whites do not necessarily share our view of “good weather” and often take off to “cooler pastures”! Having said that, nothing in nature is cast in stone and sightings can vary daily from very good to below average, and there is still a 90% chance of seeing sharks. With wildlife there are no guarantees, but you can always be assured of a most enjoyable boat trip along our scenic coastline and meeting other members of our extraordinary marine wildlife – penguins, seals and various pelagic birds. Encountering pods of dolphins may just be an unexpected bonus!\n\nThe water temperature can be anywhere between 12º C and 20º C.\n\nVisibility is usually 0.5 m, but it can go up to 1 – 5 m on a good day.\n\nIn order to attract the sharks to the boat it is necessary to lay down a scent trail for them to follow. Our “chumming” consists out of a bait bag (chumsicle) containing only fish products. This makes a very light scent trail for the sharks to follow. Fish is attached to a bait line to lure the sharks to the boat. The sharks are not fed as the bait is kept away as they approach"
