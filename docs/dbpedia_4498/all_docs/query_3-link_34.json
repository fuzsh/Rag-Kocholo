        "text": "Planet Earth is blessed with over five-hundred species of shark, and South Africa enjoys the biggest share of all. Here in the waters of False Bay and Cape Point, we are blessed with Bronze Whaler sharks, Sevengill sharks, Mako sharks, Blues sharks, and, of course, the iconic Great white shark ‚Äì not to mention an abundance of other marine life, including inquisitive Cape fur seals, comedic African penguins, thousand-strong pods of Common dolphins, plus the magnificent Southern Right and Brydes Whales.\n\nApex Shark Expeditions operate licensed, eco-friendly cage diving trips, focused on introducing people to these incredible animals and providing an understanding with a strong conservation message.\n\nApex‚Äôs ethos is simple ‚Äì to share the love of wildlife in a friendly, educational and professional environment. We value our guests highly; every effort is taken to ensure your comfort, and with longer trips than any other operator conducted with the smallest group sizes in the industry, we are proud to have gained an unparalleled reputation in giving our guests the ultimate experience with personal attention and insight conveyed by our experienced guides.\n\nOur aim ‚Äì to ensure you get the absolute most from your time with us aboard. And with forty-percent of our clientele being repeat guests, the figures speak for themselves.\n\nMany of our longer expeditions are led by some of the world‚Äôs most respected scientists and biologists, and Apex continues to be leaders in shark research, lectures and collaborations on scientific papers. So, by stepping aboard with us, you will not only be in the company of pioneers, but ground-breakers too, in shark education and conservation.\n\nApex Shark Expeditions is on the cutting edge of marine wildlife photography giving photographers, both amateur and professional alike, fantastic opportunities to capture the best shots without compromising the animals. This is why we have been the first-choice shark diving company for many of the world‚Äôs top wildlife photographers and film crews ‚Äì including BBC‚Äôs Planet earth and Discovery Channels Air Jaws series, plus the makers of over forty other documentaries have all been exclusively or partially facilitated by Apex Shark Expeditions.\n\nIt is our passion to provide you with a life-changing experience and new appreciation of the wildlife we are fortunate enough to encounter. While the sharks are our primary focus, our trips are much like going on an African safari, and should not be rushed, but cherished and savoured, hence being longer than any other operators. Weather conditions and shark behaviour can be unpredictable, so shark sightings are not always guaranteed. However, with our years of experience and knowledge of the waters, we will do our utmost to show you these majestic creatures.\n\nFrom the whole Apex team ‚Äì we look forward to welcoming you aboard soon."
