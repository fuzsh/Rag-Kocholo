        "text": "In the making of “Jaws,” the three mechanical models of the shark, collectively known as Bruce, earned a reputation for being notoriously unreliable.\n\nBruce was a temperamental star of the 1975 Steven Spielberg film, and prolonged breakdowns were a common occurrence.\n\nBut the title for most unpredictable shark — mechanical or real — might have just been wrested by another great white, this one named Katharine.\n\nKatharine, all 2,300 pounds and 14 feet 2 inches of her, was tagged with a tracking device on Aug. 20, 2013, off the coast of Cape Cod by a crew from Ocearch, a nonprofit that travels the world facilitating ocean and fish research.\n\nFor years, Katharine, who is named after Katharine Lee Bates, the writer of the verses to “America the Beautiful,” delighted the public, especially when she drew near coastlines, as reports of her whereabouts appeared on Ocearch’s online tracking map.\n\nHer Twitter account (“misunderstood but sassy girl just tryin’ to get some fish”) gained more than 61,000 followers.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
