        "text": "There are a number of questions (about the ending, explanations, other spoilers, etc.) that get asked pretty frequently about this book, so I thought I’d just answer them here.\n\nFor the full review and a detailed summary of the plot, see the Summary and Review for Where the Crawdads Sing.\n\nWhere can I find a full plot summary of Where the Crawdads Sing?\n\nRight here! Summary and Review for Where the Crawdads Sing. There’s a short/quick version and a longer, more detailed version.\n\nWhat is the meaning of the title of the book “Where the Crawdads Sing”?\n\nThe meaning of the title “Where the Crawdads Sing” comes from Delia Owens’s childhood experiences (something her mother used to say). It’s also a phrase that the character of Tate says in the book.\n\nIn Chapter 17, when Tate and Kya are looking for a place to hang out, Tate suggests that they go somewhere “where the crawdads sing.” He explains to Kya that it means “far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters.” In other words, he’s suggesting they go off somewhere far from other people, deep into nature.\n\nFrom the book: “Well, we better hide way out there where the crawdads sing. I pity any foster parents who take you on.” Tate’s whole face smiled.\n\n“What d’ya mean, where the crawdads sing? Ma used to say that.” Kya remembered Ma always encouraging her to explore the marsh: “Go as far as you can—way out yonder where the crawdads sing.”\n\n“Just means far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters.”\n\nThroughout out the book, Delia Owens’s writing shows a great fondness for the natural world. Her past work (as a wildlife scientist in Africa), as well as the title of this novel, are a reflection of this.\n\nDelia Owen discusses the origins of this phrase and how it relates to her life in an interview with Hello Sunshine. “When I was a young girl growing up in south Georgia, my mother encouraged my girlfriends and me—whether we were exploring on foot or riding our horses—to venture as far into the oak forests as we could go. She wanted me to experience true nature, to find that place where the deer and foxes still behaved as they always had in the wild. She’d say, “Go way out yonder where the crawdads sing.” And we did.”\n\nHow is Kya able to contact Chase to lure him to the fire tower?\n\nIt’s not really stated how exactly she lures him to fire tower. We know that she does because it’s referenced in her poem, the Firefly (reproduced below).\n\nAs one of the commenters below (thanks Lindsay!) points out below, it may have been via phone because during the trial, the hotel manager, Mr. Lang Furlough, mentions that she was oddly unfamiliar with how to use the telephone. That seems to indicate she may have asked him how to use it in order to contact Chase.\n\nOtherwise, she could have left Chase a note or something.\n\nWhy did Kya keep the shell necklace?\n\nThe book does not explicitly state Kya’s reasons for keeping the shell necklace. Presumably though, she saw it as some symbol of her relationship with Chase, possibly a representation of her “taking back” something (her dignity, her pride, her sense of safety, her sense of self worth, etc.) from him.\n\nIt’s important to remember that it was originally a gift from Kya to Chase, and it only ends up back in Kya’s hands when she murders him. In killing him, she likely wanted revenge, but also to reclaim some sense of power or something like that. So, you could see it as her taking something back from him when she killed him. At that point, it becomes a symbol of Kya taking herself back or taking back the power in their relationship (or her dignity or something else) which could be the reason she would want to keep this symbol of her reclaiming something she feels he took from her.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that it’s a memento of an experience that shaped her as a person for better or for worse, so she wanted to keep it.\n\nOf course, another perfectly legitimate explanation is that she keeps it because it was a necessary literary device to provide affirmative evidence of what happened at the end of the story. :)\n\nIs the town of Barkley Cove, North Carolina a real place? What city was it based on?\n\nWhere the Crawdads Sing is set in the fictional coastal fishing town of Barkley Cove in eastern North Carolina. (See the map at the end of this post.) From the trial in the book, we know that it is a 1 hour and 35 minute bus ride away (when traveling in the middle of the night with presumably no traffic) from Greenville, NC.\n\nIt unknown what city Barkley Cove was based on. (If you google this question, the city of Asheville sometimes comes up as the answer, but that is not accurate. Asheville is not a coastal town; it’s simply a large city that gets mentioned a few times in the book. Incidentally, it’s also the city where Delia Owens lives.)\n\nWhat is the poem (The Firefly) at the end of Where the Crawdads Sing?\n\nThe full text of The Firefly is below.\n\nThe Firefly\n\nLuring him was as easy\n\nAs flashing valentines.\n\nBut like a lady firefly\n\nThey hid a secret call to die. A final touch,\n\nUnfinished;\n\nThe last step, a trap.\n\nDown, down he falls,\n\nHis eyes still holding mine\n\nUntil they see another world. I saw them change.\n\nFirst a question,\n\nThen an answer,\n\nFinally an end. And love itself passing\n\nTo whatever it was before it began. A.H.\n\nIs Where The Crawdads Sing based on a true story?\n\nNo, Where the Crawdads Sing is a work of fiction.\n\nDelia Owens may have been indirectly involved / associated with a murder in Africa, but it is unrelated to the story in Where the Crawdads Sing. The incident in question is only very tenuously connected to Delia Owens, but if you are curious, feel free to read the discussion of Slate’s Delia Owens expose.\n\nLet’s talk about actual science. Do Crawdads Sing? Like the actual animals?\n\nYes! Well, sort of. Crawdads don’t exactly sing, but they make noises if you want to count that. According to this aquarium, “Crawdads (also known as Crayfish) make produce sounds through their scaphognathite, which is a thin appendage that draws water through the gill cavity. They move the scaphognathite and produce sound and air bubbles.\n\nThey will produce a series of pulse trains that is believed to signal an individual’s presence to other crayfish. It is also believed that they produce sounds to alert other crayfish to predators, or to attract a second predator to prey upon the predator.”\n\nWhat is the “Marsh Girl” / Kya’s full name in Where the Crawdads Sing? Why is Kya called the “Marsh Girl”?\n\nKya’s full name is Catherine Danielle Clark. She is nicknamed the “Marsh Girl” because she lives in the nearby swampy marshes on the outskirts of town.\n\nWhat race is the character of Kya in Where the Crawdads Sing? Is Kya black or Native American?\n\nKya is not black or Native American. Kya refers to herself as “white trash” at one point, so I think we can safely assume that she and her family are white.\n\nAlso, commenter Si Aspen adds: On pg 222, there is a conversation between Kya and Jumpin. It states, “In another time and place, an old black man and a young white woman might have hugged. But not there, not then.” So that confirms that Kya is white.\n\nIs there a Where the Crawdads Sing movie or film adaptation?\n\nA movie adaptation of Where the Crawdads Sings is in active development. For all the details, see Everything We Know about the Where the Crawdads Sing Movie.\n\nWhere can I find the map of (the fictional town of) Barkley Cove?\n\nRight here! This map of (the fictional town of) Barkley Cove, North Carolina is from the e-book version of Where the Crawdads Sing.\n\nStill confused over something? Drop a comment below and I’ll try to answer if I can! :)"
