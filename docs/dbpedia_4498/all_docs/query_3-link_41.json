Some areas of the trail were also burned, as was a large portion of Glenwood Canyon. Public safety continues to be the priority, and there is a long-term risk of post-fire flooding and debris flow. The White River National Forest has worked with a number of stakeholders including the Colorado Department of Transportation on short and long-term mitigation measures. Hikers holding permits to use the trail will receive detailed information regarding emergency procedures.\n\nThe Forest Service won’t know for a while what long-term impacts will be because the health of Hanging Lake is directly tied to hydrology of the area. Fire-related erosion and runoff getting into the fragile lake ecosystem is a major concern. The Forest Service is working with experts on mitigation efforts to protect the area. For donations to help with trail maintenance in Glenwood Canyon check out the Glenwood Canyon Restoration Alliances:\n\nDonate to the Glenwood Canyon Restoration Fund!\n\nHow long is the Hanging Lake trail?\n\nThe hike to Hanging Lake is a moderate to difficult hike up into a narrow drainage for 1.2 miles with over 1,000 feet of elevation gain.

Over the years, water flowing over Bridal Veil Falls has deposited dissolved carbonates to build up the fragile lake edge. Because of its uniqueness, the area was designated a National Natural Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior in 2011.\n\nOver the years the popularity of the area has increased leading to vegetation and trail damage and overcrowding. A management plan was put in place in 2018 to protect this natural wonder into the future. A percentage of the fees collected for reservations will be reinvested into the long-term stewardship and sustainability of Hanging Lake. The implementation of the permit system, environmental education and interpretation program will help visitors play an active role in protecting the ecological health of Hanging Lake, improve the visitor experience and support the local tourism economy.\n\nCare for Colorado Principles\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nThis land really is your land. Our state and federal agencies manage 42 percent of Colorado’s majestic landscape, and our cities and counties maintain even more. Learn about and respect the spaces we all own, share and sing about.\n\nStay back from the pack. Find your way to less-visited and off-peak destinations to minimize down time and maximize your connection with special places.\n\nBring along reusable water bottles or hot drink tumblers to limit waste and stay hydrated in our dry climate.\n\nStick To Trails\n\nWith 39,000 marked trails and 13,000 designated campsites, there’s no need to venture beyond. By sticking to these areas and camping at least 200 feet from lakes, rivers and streams, you’re helping natural areas stay natural.\n\nEven though shortcuts can be tempting, please don’t take them. A few extra strides on the path will protect plants and the homes of the true locals.\n\nTrash the Trash\n\nPack it in, pack it out. Or pick it up to leave a place better than you found it. Put litter, even crumbs, peels and cores in your nearest waste/recycling bin.\n\nWash yourself, your dog or whatever else needs cleaning at least 200 feet from waterways, and use biodegradable soap. A bubble bath is no treat for fish.\n\nLeave It As You Find It\n\nLeave plants, rocks and historical items as you find them so others experience the joy of discovery.\n\nAny of our 750 different species of wildflowers will live forever in a photo. Snap away, but only with a camera.\n\nColorado is beautiful all on its own. Building structures or campsites on public land isn’t cool. Keep it pristine for everyone to enjoy.\n\nTreat all living things with respect. Carving or hacking plants and trees may kill or disfigure them.\n\nBe Careful With Fire\n\nColorado’s low humidity has perks, but can create dry, dangerous conditions. Keep campfires small and manageable to avoid sparking wildfires.\n\nWhen putting out a fire, water it until you can handle the embers. Never let a fire burn unattended.\n\nUse care when smoking in Colorado’s dry climate. Always put cigarettes out completely and don’t leave your butts behind.\n\nAlways check for local fire restrictions.\n\nKeep Wildlife Wild\n\nColorado is home to tens of thousands of furry, scaly and feathered creatures. To keep them – and you – safe, don’t approach them.\n\nIt is not adorable to feed wild animals. You could alter natural behaviors, exposing them to predators or even euthanasia.\n\nKeep your furry buddies leashed when enjoying dog-friendly trails, and pack out their waste. All the way to a trashcan.\n\nShare Our Trails & Parks\n\nChances are you’re not out in nature to people watch, so try out the lesser-known paths and sites.\n\nSilence your cell phone before stepping into nature and speak softly without using the speaker function.\n\nBe considerate when passing others on the trails and yield to the uphill hiker and biker – they need the momentum.\n\nListen to nature. Keep your voice and music soft so all can enjoy the peace of Colorado.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\nWe are committed to answer all questions & concerns!Please make sure to check out the FAQs above before calling or emailing:\n\ninfo@hanginglaketrail.com\n\n970-384-6309\n\nHanging Lake Express is provided by H2O Ventures.\n\nALL THE OTHER WONDERS OF GLENWOOD SPRINGS\n\nHanging Lake a Colorado Wonder! Preserved with care. Enjoyed for generations. And it’s just the beginning! There is so much more to the Land of Water:"
