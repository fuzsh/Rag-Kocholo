        "text": "During my grade school years in the early 1970s, I read everything. Books, of course — books about dogs and teen detectives and gruesomely martyred saints — but also the morning newspaper and the evening newspaper, a long-dead relative’s ancient encyclopedias, my father’s Reader’s Digest, my mother’s Southern Living. In the time-honored tradition of nerds everywhere, I read the backs of cereal boxes with the same rapt attention that I devoted to “Old Yeller” and Nancy Drew. If there were words before me, I read them.\n\nBy sixth grade, I had exhausted the school library’s appealing options and moved on to the county bookmobile. When children’s books proved too short to hold me through the long, unoccupied days of summer, I started choosing books from the adult sections, too — just to have enough to read until the bookmobile came back. The driver, unsure how to manage this wondrously ecumenical but often wildly inappropriate range of titles, asked my mother to sign a form that gave me permission to check out anything I cared to read.\n\nMy mother didn’t hesitate to sign it and then paid no attention to the books I chose. If she had, she would have discovered that tucked among books like “Dracula” and “All Creatures Great and Small” and “The Complete Poems of Edgar Allan Poe” were titles like “The Stepford Wives” and “Valley of the Dolls” and “Jaws.” I doubt Mom would have been thrilled to discover that in learning about great white sharks, I was also picking up some unexpected information about what adults in the midst of an extramarital affair could do with their hands in the front seat of a moving car, but the subject never came up."
