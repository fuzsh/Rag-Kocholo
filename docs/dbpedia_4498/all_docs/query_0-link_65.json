        "text": "Length: 4 miles\n\nThe highlight of this trail is the Gazebo, at about 1900 feet in elevation, where there are magnificent panoramas of Skytop Lodge, the Lake, Camelback Mountain, the Delaware Water Gap and an endless stretch of forest. This is an excellent vantage point from which to watch migrating hawks and flaming foliage in autumn, or to just relax and enjoy the beauty of nature at any season. It’s not necessary to hike the entire trail at once – many people walk to the Gazebo via one route and return by another. The trail is also challenging for cross-country skiing in winter but steep sections are also used by downhill skiers who the right-of-way."
