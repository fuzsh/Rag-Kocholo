        "text": "At 2.4 miles, this moderately difficult trail is the most popular loop in North Parkâ€™s South Ridge. Park at the far end of the Pie Traynor lot. Look for the soccer field sign at the end of the lot. Follow that gravel path to the right. At the end of the path make a left turn onto the white blazed trail. The trail descends into the valley, away from the busy South Ridge area and passes through a rocky woodland. Cross over a few small streams and pass through shaded pine forests before ascending back out of the valley along former service roads. The second half of the trail closely follows the South Ridge Loop Road but stays tucked back far enough to offer a nice respite from busier park areas. As you wind your way back to the parking lot, pass beneath a large canopy of towering oak trees."
