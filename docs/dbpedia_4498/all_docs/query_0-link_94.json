        "meta_description": "The first part of this loop trail is a level walk over the remains of the railroad tram built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to bring in steel and lumber from Cotter to construct Bull Shoals Dam. Once the trail crosses the paved road, it goes up the hillside to an area overlooking the White River, Bull Shoals Dam, and the Ozark hill country. The trail then leads through cedar glades, mature deciduous forests, and across streams. These areas provide excellent habitat for colorful Ozark wildflowers.",
