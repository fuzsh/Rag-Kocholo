        "text": "One of the most special experiences in my life has always been hiking by myself in the great outdoors. Enter: my picks for the best hiking books to read this year (the all-time top books about hiking).\n\nSpending time in nature has been some of the best therapy I can get—and I know therapy, lol. That’s why hikers like me often feel the call back to the great outdoors when we’re in need of being grounded. And whether it’s a short hike in Yosemite or a maxed out limit-pushing backpacking trek, the end result is always the same for me—a deep sense of fulfillment and reconnection with myself.\n\nWhether you’re a beginner hiker, seasoned adventurer or just shopping for thoughtful hiking gifts for your favorite hiker—hiking books are a great way to supplement real-world hiking experience. Hiking books have several benefits for hikers of all stripes, including:\n\nEducating you on best practices for hiking in a particular region\n\nInspiring your next adventure (picking a destination)\n\nEntertaining you with stories in a subject matter you love\n\nThese benefits (and more) are why I’ve compiled this list of my picks for the absolute best hiking books to read in 2023. So, without further ado, let’s quickly dive into our list of the top books for hikers, shall we?\n\n16 Best Hiking Books to Read (Books About Hiking) in 2023\n\nInto the Wild by Jon Krakauer\n\nThru-Hiking Will Break Your Heart by Carrot Quinn\n\nInto Thin Air by Jon Krakauer\n\nWild by Cheryl Strayed\n\nOn Trails: An Exploration by Robert Moore\n\nHow to Suffer Outside: A Beginner’s Guide to Hiking and Backpacking by Diana Helmuth\n\nShe Explores by Gale Straub\n\nWalks in the Wild: A Guide Through the Forest by Peter Wohlleben\n\nMedicine for the Outdoors: The Essential Guide to First Aid and Medical Emergencies by Paul S.

Are you looking for a hiking book to motivate your next hike and awaken the adventurer inside you?\n\nHere are some of the best books for hikers that’ll help you do just that. With a mix of preparation tips, wisdom from those experienced on the trail, and much more—you can’t go wrong with these classic hiking books.\n\n1. Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer\n\nInto the Wild sits hands down at the top of my list of the best hiking books of all-time, for good reason. It’s the tragic story of 24-year-old adventurer Christopher McCandless. The tale follows his journey after renouncing all his worldly possessions and disappearing down a snowy track in Fairbanks, Alaska in 1992. All he had with him was a light backpack and meager equipment.\n\nSadly, his remains were discovered in an abandoned school bus in Alaska, five months later.\n\nInto the Wild is Jon Krakauer’s eulogy to young Chris. Pieced together from Chris’ journal, family testimony, and eye-witness accounts, this hiking book highlights the challenges of surviving in the harsh Alaskan wilderness. This hiking book was also adapted into a fantastic 2007 film of the same name, starring Emile Hirsch. More than anything else though, the most important lessons to be taken away from this gripping and chilling tale of a naive adventurer, is the importance of proper preparation for every hike and knowing your limits—whether you’re on a quick day hike in Yosemite, or trekking for weeks through the Himalayas.\n\n2. Thru-Hiking Will Break Your Heart by Carrot Quinn\n\nWhether you’re planning a hike on the Pacific Crest Trail or simply looking for a book that shares first-hand experience on the trail, then this book is for you.\n\nIn Thru-Hiking Will Break Your Heart, Carrot shares her journey as she hiked the famous trail from Mexico to Canada. Unlike most hiking books written in novel format, this one reads more like a journal, sharing the author’s daily experiences on the trail.\n\nThe book gives readers a look into the physical and mental challenges the author went through. From loneliness to dehydration to blisters to the people she meets along the way and everything else to be expected on such a long hike, Carrot reveals it all. Thankfully, the book is written in a humorous way, making it a fun read.\n\n3. Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer\n\nThis is another classic hiking book by renowned author Jon Krakauer. Into Thin Air tells the personal story of Krakauer’s Mount Everest summit attempt that went terribly wrong.\n\nThis real life tale adventure takes place in 1996 and tells the story of a group of hikers that got stranded at high altitudes when a storm hit. Jon Krakauer just happened to be a part of that group and documented the events during and after the storm—which sadly included the deaths of eight climbers, the biggest loss of life in a single day on Mount Everest.\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway from this gripping hiking book is just how much can go wrong on a hike. However, it also depicts the importance of determination, grit and creativity needed to ensure that every hike, even those that go wrong, can recover.\n\nInto Thin Air will appeal to hikers of all types, but those who love strenuous mountain trails will especially love this epic book about hiking.\n\n4. Wild by Cheryl Strayed\n\nHailing as one of the most popular hiking books to come out in the past decade, Cheryl Strayed’s Wild is a personal account of her journey hiking a thousand miles of the Pacific Coast Trail by herself, at age 22. It’s a beautiful, fun and deeply personal exploration of her life after the death of her mother and the end of her marriage.\n\nEmbarking on her hike with no experience or training on one of the most legendary (and strenuous) hiking trails in the US—the Pacific Coast Trail—Strayed set out to cover more than a thousand miles from the Mojave Desert in California up through Oregon and into Washington.\n\nPacked full of the terrors and pleasures of how Strayed pushed herself through a challenging adventure that sometimes drove her mad, this hiking book is special to me, because it ends with how she was ultimately strengthened and healed through the inner journey that came along the way. To top it all off, this book also earned itself a great 2014 film adaptation featuring Reese Witherspoon.\n\n5. On Trails: An Exploration by Robert Moore\n\nOn Trails: An Exploration is a best-selling hiking book that should be on every avid hiker’s bookshelf (or Kindle). It’s a beautiful culmination of Moore’s experience hiking different trails over the course of decades. Surprisingly though, it doesn’t focus just on the trails themselves.\n\nInstead, Moore takes a different approach and focuses on the history of the trails, why each is so appealing, and how they connect us to the natural world. This is more of a hiking book about the psychology, philosophy and science behind the world of hiking.\n\nBe warned that this book about hiking does not take a linear route as many readers expect. Instead, it meanders through different ideas, questions and lessons… like the trails it uses as a vehicle for the exploration. However, this hiking book is a fascinating read with a central theme—how trails are an excellent way to unwind and build a closer relationship with nature.\n\n6. How to Suffer Outside: A Beginner’s Guide to Hiking and Backpacking by Diana Helmuth\n\nIf you’re looking for an easy-to-read beginner’s guide on hiking, then this is one of the best hiking books for you. How to Suffer Outside explores modern hiking culture and its weaknesses while guiding beginner hikers on how to enjoy their newfound love—without burning a hole in their pockets.\n\nDiana offers real-world practical advice based on her experiences on various trails. Like an open book, she fearlessly (and humorously) shares her fails, wins and opinions about all things hiking. Featuring equally humorous illustrations, this is a light read that’s truly worth its weight in gold thanks to the valuable insights contained within this very special book for hikers of all ages and experience levels.\n\n7. She Explores By Gale Straub\n\nWhile this hiking book is tailored more toward female hikers, its adventures will be enjoyed by anyone, trust me. She Explores features the stories of 40 different women and their experiences in nature. The stories are as diverse as the women themselves, with some hiking in the wild, others living in vans & vintage trailers, and some sleeping under the stars.\n\nOften described as “beautiful, exhilarating, and empowering,” this makes my list of the best hiking books because it’s a worthy celebration of female bravery that shares the personal narratives of each contributor—all accompanied by breathtaking photos. Aside from personal narratives, She Explores also offers practical tips and advice for women planning their own solo trips into nature.\n\n8. Walks in the Wild: A Guide Through the Forest by Peter Wohlleben\n\nA list of the best hiking books for hikers of all stripes can’t be complete without this gem from Peter Wohlleben.\n\nWalks in the Wild is a short hiking book for anyone who wants to learn more about navigating hikes through forests. The book offers a lot of bite-sized tips that include:\n\nMaking the most of your time in the woods\n\nHow to navigate yourself in the forest\n\nTips on how to spot wild animals (and what to do in an encounter)\n\nThe relationship between flora, fauna and the humans who hike through forests\n\nWalks in the Wild is packed with many interesting short stories, insights and interesting facts. The advice and inspiration in this hiking book is designed to give beginner hikers something to think about as they prepare for their adventure into the wild.\n\nBest Hiking Books to Equip You to Be a Better Hiker\n\nFor the avid hiker who wants to be better equipped for any situation on the trail, here are some of the best hiking books you can read to (mentally) prepare yourself.\n\n9. Medicine for the Outdoors: The Essential Guide to First Aid and Medical Emergencies by Paul S. Auerbach\n\nFirst published in 1986, Medicine for the Outdoors is one of those essential hiking books that’s been a staple in many a hiking backpack across the world.\n\nThis book is one of the best manuals on first aid in the wilderness. Don’t be deterred by the old publishing date, though. The updated version is packed with step-by-step instructions for the modern-day hiker to respond to most medical emergencies you’re likely to encounter in the wilderness.\n\nFeaturing a lot of illustrations to make it easier to follow the procedures, this hiking book will show you that saving a life in the wilderness doesn’t have to be complicated. This is definitely a top book to add to your library, particularly if you love backpacking and will be making extended stays out on the trail.\n\n10. Wilderness Navigation: Finding Your Way Using Map, Compass, Altimeter & GPS by Bob and Mike Burns\n\nNavigation is an essential skill every hiker should at least take time to learn the basics of. That’s why no list of the best hiking books could be complete without a seminal book on navigation. And it doesn’t get better than Wilderness Navigation.\n\nWilderness Navigation is one of the foremost, best-selling hiking books on navigation of all-time. It’s even used as a textbook in outdoor education courses across the United States.\n\nThis book teaches map, compass, altimeter and GPS skills to help readers travel safely in the wilderness. It also lists recommended websites, apps and other resources that provide useful navigational information. Wilderness Navigation is updated regularly, to ensure current declination maps for the US. With helpful features like mini-quizzes, practice problems and more, you’ll be a navigation pro with this hiking book in no time. And it’ll help you better judge your own limits, taking into account crucial information like the best time to visit Yosemite National Park if you’re planning a big trek and the weather’s looking questionable.\n\n11. The Backpacker’s Field Manual by Rick Curtis\n\nThe Backpacker’s Field Manual is a thoroughly researched yet easy-to-read backpacking guide for backpackers of every level. This hiking book explores everything from how to plan a trip, to select the right gear (like the best hiking boots for your trek) to emergency procedures, and first-aid care in the field.\n\nHailed as one of the most comprehensive manuals on backpacking, The Backpacker’s Field Manual is an indispensable guide for trip planning. It also works as a quick reference on the trail for various situations, including:\n\nTips for packing light (always a struggle for me)\n\nWilderness skills like forecasting the weather, bear-proofing your camp and more\n\nTips for safe and satisfying hiking from an experienced backpacker\n\nPacked with so much knowledge and practical advice, this is one of those few hiking books you should carry with you whenever you hit the trail for an adventure.\n\n12. The Ultimate Hiker’s Gear Guide by Andrew Skurka\n\nEvery hiker knows that the gear you take on a hike can make or break the experience. The right gear can even save your life (I’ve learned this, myself).
