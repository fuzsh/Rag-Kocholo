Trail criteria were developed to ensure the Great American Rail-Trail would provide safe, nonmotorized travel on a route that is entirely walkable and bikeable. These trail criteria specify that:\n\nThe Great American Rail-Trail be one contiguous route that is reasonably direct between Washington, D.C., and Washington State, and across each of the states it traverses.\n\nIt will be separated from vehicle traffic—a minimum of 80 percent initially and ultimately entirely separated when the trail is complete.\n\nIt will comprise existing trails to the extent possible and will represent trail priorities of the states and local jurisdictions that will host it.\n\nIt will follow the most feasible route with regards to topography, geography and political priorities.\n\nIt will serve as a catalyst for local economic development, including providing services for long-distance travelers.\n\nStates on Route\n\nThe Great American Rail-Trail is a trail for everyone—separated from vehicle traffic, with gentle grades and an unparalleled experience. Key to the process of defining the preferred route of the Great American Rail-Trail was confirming a route across the country that would provide the highest-quality experience for all types of trail users—from long-distance cyclists and runners to casual daily explorers and everyone in between.\n\nRTC worked in close partnership with dozens of state agency representatives and hundreds of trail partners from across the country to assess and define the preferred route for the Great American to ensure a contiguous and reasonably direct route as well as one that complemented state priorities.
