        "text": "âBeguilingâ¦ Habeckâs setup allows her to grapple with big questionsâ¦ [and] imbues the smallest interactions and moments with poetic weightâ¦ Surprising and pleasurably uncategorizable. Shark Heart is wild, in every sense of the word.â\n\nâNew York Times Book Review\n\nâA tender story about the endurance of a married coupleâs loveâ¦ Vulnerable and devastating.â\n\nâPopSugar\n\nâRaw, powerful, and delightfully unusualâ¦ [Shark Heart] is structurally and lyrically daring, so much so that its pages quickly envelop readers in its emotional challenges and magicâ¦ While it begs readers to contemplate what it means to be human, it also challenges them to look at their circumstances carefully and reminds them to be grateful for what they have at hand rather than dwelling on what they may have lost. Shark Heart is an unforgettable and much needed love story for a new, uncertain, and rapidly changing era.â\n\nâSouthern Review of Books\n\n\"a sweet and heartbreaking tale highlighting the hiccups of marriage, motherhood, and grief.\"\n\nâCosmopolitan, \"The 19 Summer Books That Are Must-Brings for Your Next Beach Vacay\"\n\n\"A highly original, heart-rending story about abiding love that transcends trauma, griefâand even metamorphosis.\"\n\nâWashington Post, \"10 Noteworthy Books for July and August\"\n\nâSurprisingly moving, oddly heartwarming, and deeply contemplative.â\n\nâBookpage\n\n\"Habeckâs debut explores the nature of grief through deft and beautiful writingâ¦ Poetic interludes and play-like vignettes punctuate the lyrical proseâ\n\nâBooklist (Starred Review)\n\nâA bit Shakespeare, a bit Kafka, and a bit Disneyâ¦ [this] debut stands out from the pack.â\n\nâKirkus Reviews\n\nâA poignant tale of grief and change.â\n\nâTown and Country\n\n\"Shark Heart is a fantastical, original, and beautifully-written novel of abandonment, love, and Ovidian transformation. It explores illness, caretaking, devotion, magical thinking, and lossâand of course great white sharksâin ways that are funny, sad, and surprising. Every page bursts with heart.\n\nâAnthony Doerr, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of All the Light We Cannot See and Cloud Cuckoo Land\n\n\"In Shark Heart, Emily Habeck doesnât shy away from the agony of goodbyes, or the torture that can accompany unexpected freedom. With an otherworldly tenderness, she reminds us that life will always demand that we give over to its momentum and adapt. The fact that these lessons are thrilling, hilarious, and effortless to read are the miracle of the book. I suspect I will ponder this book over and over; so rich with fantasy yet as frank and real as anything Iâve ever read.\"\n\nâMary Louise Parker, author of Dear Mr. You\n\n\"Shark Heart is one of those rare books that reaches right into you and reflects lived experience so exactly, and so poetically, that it feels like you're being seen. It wears its heart openly and unapologetically on its sleeve. Equal parts tenderly comedic and tragic, the book was a difficult one to read, but I'm so glad I did.\"\n\nâMarianne Gordon, author of The Gilded Crown\n\nâA stunning debut which grabs you with its unique style, holds you within its vulnerability and leaves you with a bittersweet aching. This is not just a story of love, itâs a story of goodbyes. Habeck delivers an innovative and inspirational story that emotionally captures its readers until the end.â\n\nâFantasy Hive\n\n\"A beautifully written, heart-wringing story about love and change, about moving forwardâas a shark always mustâand what is lost and what gained as we do so. Habeck has an extraordinary command of her writerly instrument, crafting sentence after sentence that feel effortless and yet are eloquent and penetrating and superb. This is the highlight of my reading-year so far.\"\n\nâAdam Roberts, international bestselling author of Salt and The This"
