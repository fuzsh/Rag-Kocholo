        "text": "GENTLEMAN\n\nShe speaks much of her father, says she hears There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart, Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection. They aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts, Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.\n\nGENTLEMAN\n\nShe talks often of her father, and says she’s learned there are deceptions in the world, and coughs, and beats her chest, and takes offense at little things, and says things that don’t make sense. Her words are meaningless—yet those who hear her babbling attempt to understand its meaning. They patch up the gaps within her words, and end up hearing what they want to hear. And the winks and nods and gestures she makes while speaking imply—without being at all clear—that she’s hinting at some terrible deeper meaning.\n\nGERTRUDE\n\n[To herself] To my sick soul—since sin is actually sickness—each little detail seems like a sign of coming disaster. Guilt fills you up with suspicions that are so hard to hide, that you give yourself away by trying so hard not to reveal them.\n\nOPHELIA\n\nPray you, let’s have no words of this, but when they ask you what it means, say you this: [sings] Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be your Valentine. Then up he rose, and donned his clothes, And dupped the chamber door. Let in the maid that out a maid Never departed more.\n\nOPHELIA\n\nPlease, let’s have no words about that, but when they ask you what it means, say this:\n\n[Singing]\n\nTomorrow is St. Valentine’s Day\n\nAnd early in the morning,\n\nI’m a girl waiting at your window\n\nWaiting to be your valentine.\n\nThen he woke and put on his clothes\n\nAnd opened his bedroom door.\n\nHe let in the girl, who when she left\n\nWasn’t a virgin anymore.\n\nOPHELIA\n\nIndeed, without an oath I’ll make an end on ’t: [sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie, for shame! Young men will do ’t, if they come to ’t. By Cock, they are to blame. Quoth she, “Before you tumbled me, You promised me to wed.” He answers, “So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun, An thou hadst not come to my bed.”\n\nOPHELIA\n\nYes, I’ll get to the end soon:\n\n[Singing]\n\nBy Jesus and Saint Charity,\n\nAlas, what a shame!\n\nYoung men will do it if they get a chance:\n\nBy God, they’re the ones to blame.\n\nShe said, “Before you took me to bed,\n\nYou promised to marry me.”\n\nHe answers:\n\n“And by the sun, I would have done just that,\n\nIf you hadn’t gone to bed with me.”\n\nOPHELIA\n\nI hope all will be well. We must be patient, but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of it, and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet ladies. Good night, good night.\n\nOPHELIA\n\nI hope everything will be all right. We must be patient, but I can’t stop crying when I think of how they laid him in the cold ground. My brother will learn of this. And so I thank you for your good advice. Come, driver! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet ladies. Good night, good night.\n\nCLAUDIUS\n\nOh, this is the poison of deep grief. It springs All from her father’s death, and now behold! O Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies But in battalions. First, her father slain. Next, your son gone, and he most violent author Of his own just remove. The people muddied, Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For good Polonius’ death, and we have done but greenly In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts. Last—and as much containing as all these— Her brother is in secret come from France, Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father’s death, Wherein necessity, of matter beggared, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death.\n\nCLAUDIUS\n\nOh, her terrible grief has poisoned her mind. All a result of her father’s death—look at her! Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude, when troubles come, they don’t come one at time like spies, but all at once like an army. First her father was killed. Then your son had to leave because of the violent thing he did. The people are stirred up and confused—thinking up dark theories and whispering about Polonius’s death—while we recklessly buried him in secrecy, without an official state funeral. Poor Ophelia has been split from her sanity—without which we’re just pictures, or even beasts. Last, and as bad as all of the rest of these, her brother has secretly returned from France. His questions about his father’s death are answered by vicious gossipers who fill his ears with nasty stories, and who—without knowing what really happened—blame it all on me. Oh, my dear Gertrude, I feel as though I’m being murdered many times at once.\n\nMESSENGER\n\nSave yourself, my lord. The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impiteous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O’erbears your officers. The rabble call him “lord” And—as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, The ratifiers and props of every word— They cry, “Choose we! Laertes shall be king!” Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds: “Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!”\n\nMESSENGER\n\nSave yourself, my lord. Not even the ocean, when it floods and devours the lowlands, is as ferocious as Laertes. He now leads your officers in rebellion against you. The commoners call him “lord” and—as if they were starting the world from scratch and had forgotten all the traditions and customs that are the bedrock of what we are–they shout, “we choose Laertes to be king!” They throw their caps in the air, applaud, and shout, “Laertes will be king! King Laertes!”\n\nCLAUDIUS\n\nWhat is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?— Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person. There’s such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will. —Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed. —Let him go, Gertrude.— Speak, man.\n\nCLAUDIUS\n\n[To LAERTES] What is the cause of this rebellion, Laertes?\n\n[To GERTRUDE] Let him go, Gertrude. Don’t worry that I’ll be hurt. God protects the king, so that while traitors can see what they want to do, they cannot make it happen.\n\n[To LAERTES] Tell me, Laertes, why you are so angry?\n\n[To GERTRUDE] Gertrude, let him go.\n\n[To LAERTES] Tell me, man.\n\nLAERTES\n\nHow came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with. To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand That both the worlds I give to negligence. Let come what comes, only I’ll be revenged Most thoroughly for my father.\n\nLAERTES\n\nHow did he die? I won’t be lied to. To hell with my oaths of allegiance! Vows can go to hell! Conscience, too! I don’t care if I’m damned. I swear that I don’t care about what happens to me in this world or the next. No matter what happens, I’ll get revenge for my father’s murder.\n\nLAERTES\n\nOh, heat, dry up my brains! Oh, salt in my tears, burn the vision out of my eyes! By heaven, I’ll get revenge equal to the depth of your madness! Oh, you rose of May, dear maiden, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! Oh God, is it possible that a young woman’s mind could die as easily as an old man’s life? Human nature is made spiritual by love. And when it is spiritual, it gives itself to the one it loves—just as Ophelia has given her sanity to her father, whom she loved.\n\nOPHELIA\n\nThere’s fennel for you, and columbines.—There’s rue foryou, and here’s some for me. We may call it “herb of grace” o’ Sundays.—Oh, you must wear your rue with a difference.— There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. Theysay he made a good end [sings] For bonny sweet Robin isall my joy—\n\nOPHELIA\n\nHere’s fennel for you, and columbines . And here’s rue for you, and some for me. We call it the merciful Sunday flower, though you should wear it for a different reason. Here’s a daisy. I’d give you some violets, but they all dried up when my father died. They say he had a good death. [Singing] For good sweet Robin is all my joy.\n\nOPHELIA\n\n[sings] And will he not come again? And will he not come again? No, no, he is dead, Go to thy deathbed. He never will come again. His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll. He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan, God ha’ mercy on his soul. — And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi’ ye.\n\nOPHELIA\n\n[Singing]\n\nAnd won’t he come again?\n\nAnd won’t he come again?\n\nNo, no, he’s dead.\n\nGo to your deathbed.\n\nHe’ll never come again.\n\nHis beard was white as snow,\n\nHis hair was all white too.\n\nHe’s gone, he’s gone,\n\nAnd we moan our useless grief.\n\nGod have mercy on his soul.\n\nAnd on the souls of all good Christians, I pray to God. God be with you.\n\nCLAUDIUS\n\nLaertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right. Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will. And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me. If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touched, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours, To you in satisfaction. But if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labor with your soul To give it due content.\n\nCLAUDIUS\n\nLaertes, let me share in your grief, or else you deny me my right. Go and choose your wisest friends, and they will sit in judgment of us. If they find me at all responsible for your father’s murder, directly or indirectly, then I’ll give up my kingdom, my crown, my life, and everything I call my own to you. But if they find me innocent, then be patient, and I’ll work with you to ensure that your soul gets what it desires."
