The White Rocks Trail is a gem of the South Mountain region. It features a 1.3 mile climb from the base of the trail at Kuhn Road to where it intersects with the Appalachian National Scenic Trail just south of Center Point Knob on South Mountain. The blue-blazed trail is well marked as it meanders from the parking area to the base of the mountain. As the trail begins to climb, hikers will encounter increasing amounts of rocks and have plenty of opportunities for rock scrambling as the trail ascends. At the summit, hikers are treated to a sprawling view of the valley below.

This valley was initially slated for housing developments, but was eventually purchased by the National Park Service at a cost of just over three million dollars so it could be preserved and maintained as valuable open space. The 850 acre purchase successfully preserved the land surrounding the White Rocks Trail and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, as well as the phenomenal viewshed from the top of the White Rocks Trail. In 2013, the White Rocks land acquisition was recognized by the Keystone Recreation, Park & Conservation Fund as an “exemplary Keystone Fund project, offering exceptional value and lasting benefits to the communities it serves.” It was given the distinction of being named the best project in the 20 year history of the Keystone Fund. The White Rocks Trail is maintained by the Mountain Club of Maryland.
