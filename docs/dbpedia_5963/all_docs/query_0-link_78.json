Established in 2019, Link is committed to making golf affordable and accessible for all.\n\nWith six venues across the UK, the company aims to breaks down traditional barriers to entry, offering inclusive and budget-friendly golfing experiences. Their mission is to create a welcoming environment for both seasoned players and newcomers, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the game of golf.\n\nLink is taking on the operation of the golf course for a period of 50 years, ensuring a sustainable future for the course.

Our priority was to find an experienced operator to look after the courses and the clubhouse to ensure they are preserved for the benefit of people in Derby, and we’ve found that in Link.\n\n“Their ethos is to break down barriers and make golf inclusive for all sections of the community, which is exactly what we want to do. They will work in close partnership with Derby Golf Club and keep the courses and clubhouse to a high standard, while their investment plans promise an even better experience for everyone.\n\n“I’d also like to thank Sheffield City Trust for their management of the course since 2015.”\n\nSinfin Golf Course has an 18-hole parkland golf course and a 6-hole footgolf course/academy course. Other facilities include a practice area, practice putting green, pavilion clubhouse and greenkeeping complex. The site also includes Cotton Farmhouse, situated close to the clubhouse, which Link hopes to bring back into use.\n\nLink Golf UK directors Andrew Terry and Joe Jackson said they were thrilled to take over the operation of Sinfin Golf Course.
