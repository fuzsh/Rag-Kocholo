These include passenger transport, traffic control, traffic engineering, parking services, Cycle Derby, highways development management, sustainable travel and transport planning. We are looking for a flexible individual to help lead our highways development management function and increase our transport planning skill base.\n\nThis is a key post that primarily requires experience in highways development management. The position requires an individual with a balanced approach, who can protect the interests of the highway authority but also build relationships with developers to find solutions to problems. The open structure that Traffic and Transportation operates provides the opportunity to take on projects from other functions within the Section. As such, experience in other areas such as transport planning and traffic engineering would be useful.\n\nYou will need either a degree in a relevant subject, or significant experience that demonstrates a thorough knowledge of highways development management and transportation issues. You will have good communication skills, team leader skills and be able to meet deadlines.\n\nFor an informal discussion please contact Andrew Gibbard on 01332 641756\n\nPlease be aware that where there are staff within the organisation who are 'at risk' of redundancy, requirements to redeploy to another suitable role will apply and take priority"
