        "text": "Fences and boundaries\n\nFrom general maintenance and wind damage, to boundary issues and responsibilities, this article should tell you what you need to know and clarify what’s your responsibility.\n\nBoundaries\n\nUntil a property is sold, all boundaries belong to Derby City Council. If a boundary is between two properties managed by Derby Homes, the tenants have a shared responsibility for maintaining the boundary.\n\nWhere a boundary lies between a Derby Homes managed property and a private property, we will speak with Derby City Council to find out who is responsible for the boundary.\n\nFences\n\nIn most cases, you are responsible for repairing and replacing fencing.\n\nWhat will Derby Homes do?\n\nAny fence that is deemed dangerous will be made safe, but will not be repaired or replaced. There are some exceptions where we may repair and replace fences, for example:\n\nin communal areas\n\nwhere properties adjoin public spaces. For example where a rear garden adjoins a park\n\nwhere there is a safety risk, such as a change in ground levels that creates potential trip or fall hazard.\n\nIn all exceptional cases, we will carry out an individual assessment to inform our decision.\n\nWhere there is a boundary dispute, we will separate two properties using a post and rail fencing.\n\nThere will be some situations where the fencing layout or location is not clearly defined enough to fit within the above guidelines. In these cases, our staff will work with you to make that judgement.\n\nHow long do fencing repairs take?\n\nDangerous fencing Will be 'made safe' within 24 to 48 hours of being reported.\n\nAll other fencing is classed as specialist, non-urgent work and will be completed within 60 working days (approximately three months). Even though the majority of this work is external and may not require an appointment, it’s best to let us know in advance if there are any issues with access as this may delay any work.\n\nNote: Where we experience high levels of reported works, for example due to storms and severe weather, timescales in some circumstances may exceed the stated response times above.\n\nPainting, staining and treating fences\n\nAs our new timber fencing is pre-treated and protected, it will usually not be necessary to paint it when it is installed. This will not reduce the lifespan or the physical appearance of the fencing. Whilst it’s not essential, treating the fence every five years, can increase the lifespan, if you decide to treat your fences, make sure the treatment is water based.\n\nSevere weather events\n\nThere are times when uncontrollable events occur that are not the fault of any party.\n\nDerby Homes are not liable for any damages caused by a severe weather event. If you have any specific concerns, we will work with you on a on a case by case basis as we acknowledge each instance is different.\n\nDamage to neighbouring properties is not the responsibility of Derby Homes. Those individuals will need to deal with incidents through their own insurance.\n\nGates\n\nOur responsibility:\n\nGates separating front and rear gardens.\n\nYour responsibility:\n\nGates you’ve installed yourself.\n\nDriveway gates.\n\nDefinitions\n\nMaintain – Fix broken panels, reset posts, rehang gates, treat/stain wood\n\nMake Safe – Removing any affected and dangerous panels or posts"
