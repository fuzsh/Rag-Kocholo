        "text": "The East Midlands route for stage four of Britain’s biggest professional cycle race, the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men, has today been announced, that will take the race from Derby to Newark-on-Trent, through Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire on Friday 6 September.\n\nFor the first time in the 20-year history of the modern race, the city of Derby will welcome the race, with the stage getting underway at 11am from outside of the Derby Arena.\n\nElvaston, Borrowash, West Hallam and Heanor all feature as the Tour heads through the roads of Derbyshire for the first time since 2015, crossing into Nottinghamshire at Eastwood and continuing through Hucknall, Ravenshead, Blidworth, Southwell and Tuxford, before crossing the River Trent to race south to the finish alongside Sconce and Devon Park in Newark-on-Trent.\n\nCommenting on the announcement, Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men Race Director Rod Ellingworth said: \"After three tough days of racing, stage four could be the first chance for the sprinters, and having seen the likes of Fernando Gaviria and Olav Kooij win in Newark-on-Trent in the past, we know it is a route and finish that suits the fast men, and also an area of the country where the race always enjoys great support from the community.\n\n\"While the roads of Nottinghamshire will be very familiar to the peloton, we are delighted to be able to showcase the Derby Arena with our start, and then head through parts of Derbyshire and west Nottinghamshire that haven't seen the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men for several years. Our thanks go to the East Midlands Combined County Authority and to our partners at Derby City Council, Derbyshire County Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, and the boroughs across the route for their support of the stage.\"\n\nCouncillor Ben Bradley, Leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, said: \"We are delighted to see the race come back to Nottinghamshire this year, thanks to our partnership with the East Midlands Combined County Authority.\n\n“It's a huge honour that the race will go through most of our county and a testament to the success of the previous four editions of the race hosted by the county council, which have attracted hundreds of thousands of spectators and generated millions of pounds for our local economy. The Tour of Britain is a fantastic opportunity to showcase the beauty and diversity of Nottinghamshire to a global audience, as well as to inspire more people to take up cycling and enjoy the health and environmental benefits of active travel. We look forward to welcoming the world's best cyclists and their fans to Robin Hood County for a fifth time and making it another memorable event for everyone involved. The county has clearly proven itself as a Tour destination, creating lasting memories and a legacy that is hard to beat.”\n\nRegional Mayor, Claire Ward, who launched her ambitions for a Visit East Midlands strategy at Derbyshire’s iconic Chatsworth House last week, said: “Those of us who live and work here know what a superb place the East Midlands is to visit, we need to tell the rest of the country and the world, hosting the Tour of Britain is a huge coup for us.\n\n“The visitor economy supports local businesses, creates jobs and wealth, but we know we can attract even more visitors, creating more opportunities across our counties, towns, villages and cities for people of all ages.\n\n“My mission is to drive inclusive growth across the region and the Visit East Midlands programme is a key part of those ambitions. The Tour of Britain is a great way to showcase what we’ve got.”\n\nAccording to latest figures from Marketing Nottingham & Nottinghamshire, the Peak District, Derbyshire and Derby, nearly 75 million visitors came to the region in 2022/23, supporting over 50,000 jobs and creating an economic impact of across the area was worth £5bn.*\n\nCouncillor Ndukwe Onuoha, Derby City Council Cabinet Member for Streetpride, Public Safety and Leisure said:\n\n“We’re delighted to mark Derby as the starting city for the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men for the first time ever. Launching from Derby Arena and traveling through Elvaston, Borrowash, and Heanor, this milestone event highlights our city’s growing prominence and offers a unique chance to showcase Derby’s commitment to promoting sports and healthy living.”\n\nCouncillor Barry Lewis, Leader of Derbyshire County Council said: “We’re delighted that the Tour of Britain is coming to the East Midlands, travelling through Derbyshire as it makes its way from Derby to Newark.\n\n“We last welcomed the Tour in 2015, and it will be good to have riders back with us in September. The Derbyshire section passes next to our wonderful Elvaston Castle Country Park, and then heads out through Borrowash, up to Risley, Dale Abbey, West Hallam, Stanley Common, Smalley and then through Heanor and Langley Mill before it crosses the county border into Nottinghamshire.\n\n“It is a wonderful opportunity to see some of the world’s finest cyclists close up and experience the thrill of the race. We hope that local people and visitors to Derbyshire will enjoy it alike.”\n\nCouncillor Paul Peacock, Leader of Newark and Sherwood District Council, commented on the announcement, saying; “Last year we were delighted to host both the start and finish for stage four of the Tour of Britain. This year we are delighted to see the Tour return to our district and to once again host the finish of the stage. Last year we saw crowds lining the streets all along the route, with local communities stepping up and decorating the way with some very creative ideas. The Coddington farmer, who managed to get his flock to create a penny farthing was a particular highlight.”\n\nCouncillor Susan Crosby, Portfolio Holder for Health, Wellbeing and Leisure at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: “But, as well as being a chance to have fun, there’s a tangible economic benefit for us as well. The event itself attracted 182,500 visitors to Nottinghamshire, with 62% coming from outside the area bringing a £4.69million boost to the County’s economy.”\n\n“More than half of the people surveyed said that the Tour of Britain has inspired them to cycle more and with there being so many health benefits associated with cycling, as well as being a greener way to travel, I am delighted to see the Tour of Britain return to our district. There are so many wonderful trails and routes to explore, it is fantastic to shine the spotlight on our area again. The route takes in the whole district from west to east, from Blidworth to Southwell and Egmanton to Coddington before returning to Newark for the finish. I’m really looking forward to seeing our residents cheering on the race and getting into the spirit again this year.”\n\nThe 86 mile (138.5-kilometre) route will include an intermediate sprint, with time bonuses and points towards the sprints jersey available, in the closing kilometres of the race at Collingham.\n\nThis year will be the third time that Newark-on-Trent has hosted a stage finish of the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain, with previous winners being Fernando Gaviria (2017) and Olav Kooij (2023). This year’s stage is expected to finish between 2.13pm and 2.52pm on the Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men begins in the Scottish Borders on Tuesday 3 September followed by stages in the Tees Valley and South Yorkshire. Following the East Midlands stage the race continues in West Northamptonshire before concluding in Suffolk on Sunday 8 September after six days of racing.\n\nMore details of the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men, including the detailed stage timings and competing teams will be announced in the coming weeks."
