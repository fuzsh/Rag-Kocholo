This election also marked a change in the electoral pattern for the city council. Prior to this election a third of the council was elected at a time three years out of every four. From this election onwards the whole council would be elected together every four years.[2]\n\nPrior to the election the council was under no overall control, being run by a Conservative minority administration. The council remained under no overall control after the election but Labour overtook the Conservatives to become the largest party.[3] Labour group leader Baggy Shanker was appointed leader of the council at the subsequent annual council meeting on 24 May 2023, leading a Labour minority administration.[4]\n\nWhile some have reported Reform Derby as being synonymous with Reform UK, the parties are in fact distinct but affiliated entities.[5][6][7]\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nElection result\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the results, the council remained in no overall control, with Labour becoming the largest party.[8]\n\n2023 Derby City Council election Party Candidates Seats Gains Losses Net gain/loss Seats % Votes % Votes +/− Labour 51 23 4 0 7 45.1 41.2 64,982 +5.1 Conservative 37 15 0 0 3 29.4 26.4 41,622 –6.0 Reform Derby 51 6 0 0 11.8 11.7 18,472 +3.7 Liberal Democrats 51 4 0 4 4 7.8 14.7 23,276 –2.2 Independent 8 3 0 0 5.9 3.4 5,322 +0.7 Green 11 0 0 0 0.0 2.7 4,228 –1.1\n\nWard results\n\n[edit]\n\nAsterisks denote incumbent councillors who sought re-election.[9]\n\nAbbey\n\n[edit]\n\nAbbey (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 24.8 Labour gain from Liberal Democrats Labour hold Labour hold\n\nAllestree\n\n[edit]\n\nAllestree (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 43.1 Conservative hold Conservative hold Conservative hold\n\nAlvaston North\n\n[edit]\n\nAlvaston North (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 26.9 Reform Derby win (new seat) Reform Derby win (new seat) Reform Derby win (new seat)\n\nAlvaston South\n\n[edit]\n\nAlvaston South (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 29.5 Reform Derby win (new seat) Reform Derby win (new seat) Reform Derby win (new seat)\n\nArboretum\n\n[edit]\n\nArboretum (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 29.6 Labour hold Labour hold Labour hold\n\nBlagreaves\n\n[edit]\n\nBlagreaves (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 40.8 Labour gain from Liberal Democrats Labour gain from Liberal Democrats Labour gain from Liberal Democrats\n\nChaddesden East\n\n[edit]\n\nChaddesden East (2 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 30.4 Conservative win (new seat) Conservative win (new seat)\n\nChaddesden North\n\n[edit]\n\nChaddesden North (2 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 24.1 Liberal Democrats win (new seat) Labour Co-op win (new seat)\n\nChaddesden West\n\n[edit]\n\nChaddesden West (2 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 22.9 Labour Co-op win (new seat) Labour Co-op win (new seat)\n\nChellaston & Shelton Lock\n\n[edit]\n\nChellaston & Shelton Lock (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 33.5 Independent win (new seat) Independent win (new seat) Independent win (new seat)\n\nDarley\n\n[edit]\n\nDarley (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 37.0 Labour hold Labour hold Labour hold\n\nLittleover\n\n[edit]\n\nLittleover (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 40.9 Liberal Democrats hold Liberal Democrats hold Liberal Democrats hold\n\nMackworth & New Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nMackworth & New Zealand (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 29.7 Conservative win (new seat) Labour win (new seat) Labour win (new seat)\n\nMickleover\n\n[edit]\n\nMickleover (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 42.0 Conservative hold Conservative hold Conservative hold\n\nNormanton\n\n[edit]\n\nNormanton (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 33.7 Labour hold Labour hold Labour hold\n\nOakwood\n\n[edit]\n\nOakwood (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 34.0 Conservative hold Conservative hold Conservative hold\n\nSinfin & Osmaston\n\n[edit]\n\nSinfin & Osmaston (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 24.7 Labour Co-op win (new seat) Labour Co-op win (new seat) Labour Co-op win (new seat)\n\nSpondon\n\n[edit]\n\nSpondon (3 seats) Party Candidate Votes % Turnout 32.8 Conservative hold Conservative hold Conservative hold"
