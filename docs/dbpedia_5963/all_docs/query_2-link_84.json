        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - A major member of Mayor Craig Greenberg’s staff is no longer with the mayor’s office. Deputy Chief of Staff Keisha Dorsey is no longer part of the mayor’s team.\n\nShe joined the Greenberg administration in January 2023. WAVE Troubleshooters received a warning letter Deputy Mayor David James sent Dorsey on Tuesday.\n\nThe letter claimed Dorsey tried to hide a conversation between her and a metro council member about a proposed ordinance. It says Dorsey’s actions were unethical and unprofessional.\n\nThe mayor’s office did not say if this was the exact reason why Dorsey is no longer Deputy Chief of Staff. Greenberg’s press secretary sent the following statement.\n\n“The Mayor and his leadership team are committed to helping Metro employees succeed in the important work they do on behalf of the people of Louisville. Public service is a calling and most Metro employees are working tirelessly to help our city grow and succeed. At the same time, the Mayor and all Metro employees are stewards of taxpayer dollars and are expected to be professional and perform their work with integrity.”\n\nOn Thursday, WAVE Troubleshooters went straight to the mayor and Dorsey to get answers. The mayor did not get into specifics, other than all city employees are stewards of the taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn a letter of reprimand, the city accused Dorsey of lobbying a council member on an issue they did not describe. When WAVE talked to Dorsey directly, she did.\n\nShe said she had talked to Councilman Jeff Hudson about a program she works with to help disabled veterans. Dorsey says it had nothing to do with city government.\n\nShe told WAVE she has filed her own ethics complaint for a hostile work environment and feels she’s been targeted for being a female minority and for being on FMLA or medical leave. Dorsey said if the mayor thinks she has abused FMLA, he needs to prove it.\n\nGreenberg told Troubleshooters he cannot talk about why she was let go, but she is one of his top-ranking officials. The move to fire her was not something we’ve typically seen in Louisville government.\n\n”We all should be held accountable,” he said. “I am held accountable, to the entire community and everyone who works in metro government. I have a responsibility to hold accountable. We are all stewards of taxpayer dollars, and we have the responsibility to be professional, and to excel at our work.”\n\nKeisha also said that she has not spoken with anyone from the Mayor’s office about this, and that she did not even know that she had been fired until the media called her about it.\n\nWAVE is filing open records requests to try to get more specifics about what happened. It seems that Dorsey is not going down without a fight.\n\nWAVE Troubleshooters spoke to Councilman Jeff Hudson, who said he will wait to comment while the mayor’s office works things through. He also added that he respects the Ethics Commission and Dorsey’s right to due process."
