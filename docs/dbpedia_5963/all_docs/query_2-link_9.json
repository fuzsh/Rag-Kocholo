The Mayor presides over City Council meetings, serves as spokesperson for the community, facilitates communication and understanding among elected officials, assists the City Council in setting goals and policies by participating in its deliberations, and serves as an ambassador and defender of the community.\n\nWith approval of the City Council, the Mayor makes appointments to fill vacant City Council seats and appoints members of city advisory boards and commissions. The Mayor also makes proclamations and serves as a key representative in intergovernmental relations.\n\nThe Mayor votes on employment matters of the city manager and municipal judge, charter ordinances, and matters prescribed by state law (i.e., zoning changes). On regular ordinances and other matters, the Mayor votes only to break a tie."
