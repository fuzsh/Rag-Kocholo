        "text": "Derby City Council has appointed Link Golf UK to manage and operate Sinfin Golf Course in Derbyshire.\n\nThe course was previously run by Sheffield City Trust (SCT), under a lease agreement with the Council. SCT indicated it wished to surrender the lease this year, so the Council launched a process to find a new operator.\n\nFollowing a lengthy selection process, Link Golf UK was identified as the preferred new operator and took over the running of the club from August 1.\n\nWith six venues across the UK, Link Golf UK was set up in 2019 and aims to breaks down traditional barriers to entry, offering inclusive and budget-friendly golfing experiences. Their mission is to create a welcoming environment for both seasoned players and newcomers, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the game of golf.\n\nLink is taking on the operation of the golf course for a period of 50 years, ensuring a sustainable future for the course. The company plans to make a significant investment in the site over the next three years, with plans to improve the course and the clubhouse. The firm also hopes to create a new driving range.\n\nCouncillor Nadine Peatfield, Leader of Derby City Council, said: “We’re delighted to welcome Link Golf UK as the new operator of Sinfin Golf Course. Our priority was to find an experienced operator to look after the courses and the clubhouse to ensure they are preserved for the benefit of people in Derby, and we’ve found that in Link.\n\n“Their ethos is to break down barriers and make golf inclusive for all sections of the community, which is exactly what we want to do. They will work in close partnership with Derby Golf Club and keep the courses and clubhouse to a high standard, while their investment plans promise an even better experience for everyone.”\n\nSinfin Golf Course has an 18-hole parkland golf course and a 6-hole footgolf course/academy course. Other facilities include a practice area, practice putting green, pavilion clubhouse and greenkeeping complex. The site also includes Cotton Farmhouse, situated close to the clubhouse, which Link hopes to bring back into use.\n\nLink Golf UK directors Andrew Terry and Joe Jackson said: “We extend our thanks to Derby City Council and Sheffield City Trust for their support during this transition. We’re excited about our new plans for the course and look forward to getting to know all the members and visitors.”"
