Along with fishing, Cub Scouts will also be able to participate in many other events such as, BBs, archery, crafts, science experiments and so much more!\n\nWe encourage our Packs to come out and camp with us for the weekend but you are more than welcome to just come to the event for a day!\n\nAll Cub Scouts will receive a patch, a mess kit and a weekend full of fun adventures!\n\nREGISTER HERE\n\nTo reserve your campsite, please contact Rebecca Skees at r.skees87@gmail.com"
