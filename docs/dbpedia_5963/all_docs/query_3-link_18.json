        "text": "Family Owned and Operated\n\nWhen you partner with Derby City Environmental, you never have to worry about how your waste is handled or where your waste will end up when we pick it up. We own and operate private wastewater facilities where we process and recycle the raw materials we collect. Because water is a critical and increasingly rare resource, we do our part by reusing or recycling nearly every drop of water that we manage. Some of the renewable raw materials that are collected will then be used to create biodiesel fuels, feeds, or compost.\n\nAbout Derby City Environmental\n\nDerby City Environmental has been family-owned and operated since inception. We started with just a single location moving Fifty Thousand Gallons (50,000 gal.) a week and have organically grown that to servicing 5 states in the Mid-south and Midwest with a fleet of state-of-the-art trucks and equipment moving more than One Hundred Million Gallons (100,000,000 Gal) through our facilities each year. If you are looking non-hazardous liquid solutions, we have you covered. We offer comprehensive non-hazardous liquids services specializing in grease traps, used cooking oil, leachate, and disposal services for many types of materials. We offer comprehensive drain line maintenance services including preventative jetting programs and blockage clearing services. We also offer large scale municipal wastewater hauling and disposal in most of our coverage areas."
