        "text": "At the City of Derby Academy, our vision is to improve the life chances of all students.\n\nWe aim to achieve this vision through the 3Ps:\n\nProvide, Promote and Prepare.\n\nOur vision and our aims are underpinned by our core values, the 3Rs:\n\nRespectful, Responsible and Ready to Achieve.\n\nAll members of the school community are expected to demonstrate and promote these values. The 3Rs are therefore the foundation of our culture and ethos: “this is how we do it here, every day”.\n\nWhilst we strive for 100%, we acknowledge that students don’t always get it right. That’s why our minimum expectation is 95% for attendance, behaviour and effort.\n\nStudents who meet the 3Rs 95% of the time qualify for praise and rewards."
