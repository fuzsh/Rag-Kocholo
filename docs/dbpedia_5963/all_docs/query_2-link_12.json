Cornish is the chief operating officer for Closing the Gap Consulting, LLC and also worked for Norton Healthcare.\n\nâTo serve as Chair of an organization that is committed to bringing the community together prior to one of the most iconic events in America is humbling,â Cornish said. âKDF, its exceptional board members, leadership team, staff, volunteers and sponsors are the best in creating and executing annually over 70 world-class events.â\n\nCornish, a Maryland native, was first elected to the Derby Festival Board in 2014 and has served on its Executive Board since 2018. He has served on several committees and worked on countless KDF events and programs including the Derby Equity & Community Initiative, Tour de Lou, the miniMarathon and Marathon and the Theyâre Off! Luncheon.\n\nJoining the 75-member Board as newly elected directors are: William âMauriceâ Brown (American Printing House for the Blind); Joe Simoneit (Courtesy Cadillac); Caroline Clark (LG&E); Brittney Monteith (Park Community Credit Union); Dean Schlader (GLI); Alfred Smith (PNC); Hank Mangeot (AT&T); Allison Martin (GE Appliances, a Haier Company); Alyssa Upton (Meijer); Dior Cotton (Humana); Jenni Schelling (Louisville Water Company); and Joanne Hurst, who is the 2025 president of The Fillies Inc.\n\nHere are the 2025 dates of some of KDFâs most popular events:"
