A chance to network with other Head teachers at a cost of Â£32 per place per meeting.\n\nWe will require places to be pre-booked so that we can ensure the meeting is meeting the minimum number required to make it financially viable to go ahead and also to allow us to give access to materials on the Schools' Information Portal to those pre-booked schools.\n\nPlaces can be pre-booked by emailing specialistsupport@derby.gov.uk. Please confirm if you would like to book for all 6 meetings in advance or individually.\n\nHandouts and Presentations\n\nHandouts, presentations and all relevant materials will be available on the Schools' Information Portal to download the day before every heads meeting, as agreed.\n\nPlease see attached HSLM welcome pack for information on entrance to the stadium, car parking and wifi etc.\n\nDates for your diary"
