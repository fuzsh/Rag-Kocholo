I have always found Baggy to be bright, thoughtful and diligent and he has grown into a first-rate politician. After close to 40 years as your MP I have no hesitation in stating that I will be voting for Baggy to be my replacement and Labour's Candidate for Derby South and I urge you to do the same."
