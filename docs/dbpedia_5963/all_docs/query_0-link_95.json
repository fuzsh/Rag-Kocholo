        "text": "Derby City Council nurtures future leaders\n\nWhen Derby City Council needed a new breed of leaders to champion their transformation agenda, they asked us for help revising their leadership development programme.\n\nThe brief\n\nTo promote its new ‘one Derby, one council’ agenda – a transformation programme to help make the organisation more unified and efficient – Derby City Council needed a group of focused leaders, who were:\n\npeople-orientated\n\ninspirational, and\n\nable to adapt to the complex environment of public sector change by innovating and nurturing talent.\n\nOur solution\n\nDesigned in very close collaboration with the Council, the new programme was built around the organisation’s leadership competencies and gave learners a Postgraduate Certificate.\n\nIt was delivered through a series of workshops, as well as evening masterclasses led by Derby City Council’s in-house experts and our team.\n\nPersonal learning was guided and supported by an online learning portal and personal tutor.\n\nEncouraging peer support and collaboration was important to the Council and so we included co-coaching elements as well as a work based project. This project enabled managers from different teams or directorates to work together and to make an immediate impact on the organisation, by applying their learning to a real leadership issue.\n\n“The leadership programme by its structure, content and delivery had enabled a group of Derby City Council managers, who were, in the main, strangers to each other, to come together and develop into a passionate, powerful, collaborative group who want to help shape the future of their organisation.”\n\nAnonymous quote from a learner during the programme evaluation\n\nFind out more"
