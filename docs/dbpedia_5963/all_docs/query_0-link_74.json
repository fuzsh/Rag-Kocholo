        "text": "The previous Conservative government committed £300 million to establish family hubs and deliver the Start for Life programme in half of English local authorities between autumn 2022 and March 2025. By May, there were around 400 family hubs in 75 local authority areas with more set to open over the next six months.\n\nHowever, uncertainty about funding levels from next April is causing concern among some family support experts that gains made by hubs could be lost.\n\nSpecial report: Developments in family support and family hubs\n\nFeature: Inside a family hub\n\nSpeaking on the latest edition of the CYP Now Podcast, Matthew Dodd, head of policy and public affairs at the National Children’s Bureau, called for the government to make a quick decision about continuing the hubs programme.\n\n“We and many others would advocate extending it beyond the 31 March 2025,” he said. “It’s still emerging, it’s not the finished article, but we don’t want to see really good work that local authorities and their partners have put in go up in smoke on 1 April.”\n\nClaire Meek, deputy director of services and innovation at Family Action, said the uncertainty over future funding was creating insecurity among her practitioners working in family hubs.\n\n“I’m already getting questions from these very skilled staff about ‘do I need to look for another job now?’ There’s a team of people over the next three or four months who we may lose,” she said.\n\nFamily hubs, which bring together early child help, parenting programmes and wider family support services under one roof, have largely replaced Sure Start children’s centres, a key policy of Tony Blair’s government in the early 2000s.\n\nAccording to recent research by public services union Unison, the number of children’s centres run by English councils has fallen 38% - more than 1,100 sites – since the 2010 peak of around 3,100. The union said this is because of cuts to local authority funding over that period and called for more investment to reverse the decline.\n\nDodd urged policymakers not to get side-tracked over the name given to services.\n\n“Whatever we call them, the model of the one-stop-shop, based in communities and looking at families’ needs in the round is right,” he said.\n\nMeek added that the family hubs approach may need to be adapted to ensure it reaches all families that need support.\n\n“We’re in a tricky political place - we don’t know whether family hubs will be extended,” she said. “Children’s centres funding was protected and as a centre manager I understood how I needed to use data to match the services to those families who didn’t traditionally come into settings. That’s something family hubs need to think about.”\n\nSpeaking at a visit to a family hub in Derby last month, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson praised the work of frontline staff.\n\nShe said: “I saw first-hand the impact supportive environments and family hubs can have on shaping young lives and heard directly about the challenges facing the sector. I am committed to breaking down the barriers to support to ensure every child across the country has the start in life they deserve.”"
