        "text": "Experiential in its simplest form means learning through doing or learning through experience, a key part being people’s reflection on those experiences. At GRA, we include practical exercises, simulations, and team challenges into our programmes to create more memorable training experiences and to help participants integrate their knowledge more successfully back in the workplace.\n\nTo find out more about our experiential approach, go to our why choose us page.\n\nAt GRA, our aim is to get to know your business like it’s our own so that we can see things through your lens. We do this by taking the time upfront to listen to your development needs and to get a full and rounded picture of your values, culture, goals, and key measures of success.\n\nOnce we’re confident we know what you’re looking for, we’ll go away and put together a proposal that details a unique training solution for you, whether that be through tailoring existing GRA products or by creating a completely new and bespoke programme that’s more specifically for your organisation or team. We not only tailor our training through content design but also in our delivery method, so whether you’re looking for a face-to-face, virtual or blended approach, we can adapt to suit your requirements.\n\nWe also recommend conducting ‘day in the life’ interviews with a selection of people from your organisation to establish hopes and concerns about upcoming training and to allow us to take a deeper dive into people’s day-to-day roles, responsibilities, and individual needs.\n\nLike our training, we tailor our evaluation strategy to the requirements of each of our customers and like to work in partnership with you to ensure we select the best metrics to evaluate the performance of our delivery team, delegate experience, learning transfer and overall service, to ensure we provide maximum ROI for your organisation. We also want to ensure that the metrics being assessed are consistent with your values and objectives.\n\nIn addition to quantitative metrics, we also believe in providing delegates with the opportunity to explore their observations and reflections in more detail and therefore recommend incorporating qualitative feedback in the review process.\n\nShould you have one, we can also work with your existing evaluation systems following the training to manage the performance of our delivery team.\n\nGRA has worked with organisations in a number of industries over the last 30 years, from manufacturing and pharmaceuticals to public health, technology, banking and insurance, local authority and more.\n\nBut even if we haven’t worked in your industry before, we take the time to listen to and learn from our clients and to tailor our training programmes to your specific needs. We may be the experts when it comes to training, but we fully recognise that you are the experts when it comes to knowing and understanding your business.\n\nWe use a range of trusted learning and development models that we really believe in and that have stood the test of time. During our 30 years of designing and delivering training, we have also developed some of our own unique models which sit within our branded training programmes.\n\nWell known models we use are, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n70-20-10 for L&D\n\nTuckman’s Stages of Group Development\n\nHerzberg’s Two Factor Theory\n\nKolb’s Cycle of Experiential Learning\n\nBelbin Team Role Theory\n\nSLII Model\n\nMBTI Four-Factor\n\nHoney & Mumford Learning Styles\n\nThomas Kilmann Conflict\n\nCovey’s Circles of Influence\n\nHeartMath Coherence\n\nHeartMath Domains of Resilience\n\nPlatinum Rule\n\nJohari Windows\n\nMcGregor’s X & Y Theory\n\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\n\nBaddeley & James’s Political Intelligence\n\nSMART Goals\n\nSWOT & Pestle\n\nYes, some of our training programmes do include the use of psychometrics or behavioural assessments and 360-degree tools, such as Belbin, MBTI, GPI, and insights.\n\nWe know that there can be a stigma around psychometrics, and therefore always want to assure our clients and delegates that those we include as part of our training are ones in which we have had many years of experience and wholeheartedly trust in their theory.\n\nWe would also never assume the narrative that these tools exclusively define anyone’s personality or behaviour and are only ever used as additional training aids. At no point is anyone made to complete something they don’t understand or made to share the results of an assessment with someone they don’t wish to.\n\nThis completely depends on the method in which we’re delivering your training and what type of training we’re delivering for you.\n\nTypically, our face-to-face training programmes can hold numbers anywhere from 5 to 30 delegates in a single classroom. Any number above 20 will usually require multiple facilitators, as will programmes that include outdoor activities. Groups over 30 will typically be delivered to in cohorts, but this is dependent on the type of face-to-face training we’re delivering for you.\n\nOur online/virtual training classes are slightly smaller and tend to accommodate anywhere from 5 to 15 delegates in a single classroom. Numbers above 15 would typically require us to deliver in cohorts, but again, this is subject to the type of online training we’re delivering for you. Most of our virtual training sessions include both a facilitator and a moderator as a minimum, more facilitators are likely to be required for higher numbers.\n\nFor Team Building events, we can accommodate anywhere from 5 to 200 delegates at any one time, location and schedule permitting. See our Team Building FAQs for more information.\n\nAll our training is either delivered by our experienced in-house training team or by one of our equally experienced and trusted associate training teams. We will never take on any training that we don’t have the capacity to facilitate within these teams. If we can’t accommodate what you’re looking for, we will always be upfront and honest about it and will point you in the direction of other providers that may be able to help you if we can.\n\nOur cancellation policy is clearly outlined in our T&Cs when forming an agreement with you, so please check this to see how you would be affected if you were to cancel. Rest assured that we will be as flexible as possible when it comes to rearranging and rescheduling dates for training and we have a fantastic administration team who would be happy to talk to you.\n\nIf you need to talk to us about cancelling or rescheduling your training, please give us a call on 01962 571005.\n\nOur Covid-19 protocols are constantly changing and evolving in line with government guidelines. Click here to see our most up to date protocols. If you have training already booked with us, our administration team will clearly outline anything you need to know about safeguarding against Covid-19 prior to your arrival at either of our Outdoor Centres.\n\nIf you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us on 01962 571005 or email us via enquiries@gra.uk.com"
