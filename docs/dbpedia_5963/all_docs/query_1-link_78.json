        "text": "DDSCP Training Courses and Events\n\nThe Derby and Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Partnership provides general and specialist courses to help build staff skills, knowledge, values and confidence when working with children, young people and families.\n\nThe training offer consists of a blended approach of events (virtual and classroom based), e-learning courses, videos and briefings. Training is co-delivered by the DDSCP Training Officer and a multi-agency pool of specialist facilitators.\n\nMulti-agency training is available for volunteers and practitioners working across Derby and Derbyshire only. Any organisations or agencies outside of Derby and Derbyshire who would like to access our training should contact the Partnership via DDSCPTraining@derby.gov.uk\n\nView our Training Offer\n\nClick here for more information on our multi-agency training and e-learning courses.\n\nCourse Booking\n\nTo book on any course you will need to register and create an account.\n\nPlease register or log in here to access the booking system.\n\nPlease use the How to create a training account guide on setting up your account. Once you have done this, you will be able to:\n\nManage your own bookings\n\nDownload course materials\n\nAccess course evaluations\n\nDownload your certificate of attendance (a course evaluation must be completed first)\n\nAccess your training history\n\nUpdate your own details if you change role or organisation\n\nReset your own password\n\nImportant: Delegates must create their own individual account. The account is linked to the email address you provide and certificates will only be issued in the name on that account. Please also see Information for delegates.\n\nNot sure what training you need?\n\nIf you are not sure what training you require, please speak to your organisation in the first instance. Agencies are expected to provide safeguarding training for their staff relevant to their role. It is not the DDSCPâ€™s responsibility to provide assurance of staff.\n\nPlease ensure that you have carefully read the Multi-Agency Training Pathway document before booking onto a multi-agency course.\n\nTo support you, please follow these steps:\n\nFirst step\n\nConsider your specific work role with children, young people and their families and reflect on your learning needs.\n\nSecond step\n\nDecide which courses are relevant to your role. Discuss and agree with your line manager which training course is appropriate to attend.\n\nThird step\n\nApply for a course through our online booking system.\n\nAn automatic email will be sent to you and your line manager confirming your booking. If you do not receive a booking confirmation, then you have not been successful in securing a place and should not attend training.\n\nAutomatic emails will also be sent if you cancel your booking or fail to attend. These emails will also be sent to your Line Manager. For all staff working for the Statutory Partners, non-attendance will be followed up by your agency."
