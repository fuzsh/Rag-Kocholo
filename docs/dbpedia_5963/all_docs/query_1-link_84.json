        "text": "Thanks to Cherokee Service, Block Portrait Studios, and Inver Grove Ford for their support.\n\nWest St. Paul City Council Member Lisa Eng-Sarne is featured in a documentary about Minnesota Roller Derby that premiered this weekend at the Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival.\n\n“I love hitting people,” Eng-Sarne told CBS News last week.\n\nFilm: Minnesota Mean chronicles the Minnesota Roller Girls in their quest for the Women’s Flat Track Roller Derby championship.\n\n11: Number of years Eng-Sarne skated with the Minnesota Roller Derby under the moniker “Diamond Rough.”\n\nRetired: Eng-Sarne retired from roller derby in 2019 when she was appointed to the West St. Paul City Council (she was later elected in 2020).\n\n“I’m tough, and that’s my reputation on the track. But I have a big heart, and I care a lot.”\n\nLisa Eng-Sarne (Jan. 17, 2019 Pioneer Press)\n\nMore West St. Paul\n\nEng-Sarne isn’t the only West St. Paul resident in Minnesota Mean. The documentary frequently features a shirtless Chad Eng, Lisa’s partner, who is a loud and proud fan.\n\nStick around for the credits for a special body makeup how-to from Chad.\n\nAlways supportive, Chad also frequently appears at West St. Paul City Council meetings to cheer on Lisa—though not quite as loud and usually without the body paint.\n\nJuly 2, 2024 Update: Now Streaming\n\nMinnesota Mean is now streaming on Amazon and Apple TV."
