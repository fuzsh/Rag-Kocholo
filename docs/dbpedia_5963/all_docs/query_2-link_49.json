        "text": "Growing your team from Performance Improvement Plans into Team MVPs\n\nGrowing your team from Performance Improvement Plans into Team MVPs\n\nI learned everything I know about leadership from roller derby. And, aside from the broken bones and bruises, the fundamentals of mentorship, coaching, and teamwork seamlessly translate into leading design teams.\n\nRoller derby. I know. Stay with me.\n\nBefore my entrance into the tech and design worlds, Gotham Girls Roller Derby was a full-time, actual real 40+ hour a week job. I helped bring what started as group of 6 women skating around in a parking lot and build it into a half a million dollar per year NY NFP that sells out arenas, has 9 international championship medals, and is currently 200 active members strong with Recreational leagues and an all-star Junior league for girls from 6–17 years old. And yes — I also skated under the name Ginger Snap after I busted my wrist in practice and traveled the world getting paid to coach derby skills — both on and off the track for skaters and league founders alike.\n\nAt Gotham Girls, one of our greatest challenges was learning how to bring our diverse skills together to empower our fellow league-mates to be their best. Convincing volunteers to show up and do their jobs, guiding new skaters, keeping veteran skaters challenged — how do you build a successful team from a group of people that have nothing in common, other than the fact we like to skate and hit each other?\n\nI’ve had the privilege of managing design teams for the past 5 years, creating space that allows not only teams to grow, but individuals as well. It’s my job to clear the way for their growth — to provide design mentorship and serve as a champion for both craft and career development. I create operational space and organizational cover to help designers focus on executing their best work.\n\nThe fundamentals for design and derby leadership aren’t that different — aside from the skates, speed, and bone crushing hits, of course. I see it as my duty to provide the team with some basic things to help them grow. To lead a team, I try and empower designers by providing them with the following:\n\nRoom to find and own their personal strengths\n\nFeedback that turns qualitative into something more quantitative and actionable\n\nSpace and time to practice their skills\n\nNot only permission, but enthusiastic encouragement to fail\n\nTo grow a great derby (and design) team, you have to keep everyone growing — no matter if you’re having to create a Performance Improvement Plan or if you’re trying to keep one of your superstars challenged.\n\n1. Provide space to diagnose real opportunities for improvement, and help them find and own their core strengths —\n\nFind where their power lies and train for stability so they can take smart risks and not get wiped out by blockers (on skates and otherwise) that come their way before they are ready to take the hits — mentally, emotionally, and with their hard craft skills.\n\nOf course it’s important to have weekly 1:1s to talk about project updates and the boring stuff, but the main thing I strive for is to make our weekly time be more impactful than going through a checklist of tasks completed. Sure — you can show up for practice and do the drills but if you don’t know why, you stunt your own progress (as well as hold the team back.) The big questions that make the most impact are “what did I learn last week” and “what do I need to learn this week” — you can design 100 screens, launch features, and sketch out new homepages but if you aren’t doing it to learn something meaningful, you’re just wasting your time.\n\nFormulating that question productively is the only way to map your way to answers. Taking the time to craft the right questions helps direct what you focus on personally to take careers to the next level.\n\nIf available, I’m kind of a nag about getting my team use their education stipends. We diagnose what it could be used for in our 1:1s and I am known for hounding the team until they spend every last dime. We look at what’s on the roadmap for the next couple quarters, see what they’d be interested in learning more about that lives in or outside those plans, and find extra curricular activities to enhance their knowledge. They then bring it back to the team and everyone benefits.\n\n2. Create measurable milestones out of qualitative feedback and draft action plans —\n\nThe core of teamwork is made of soft skills which always has a danger of being too subjective. Without measurable milestones, it’s hard to make decisions when it’s time to evaluate level and compensation changes.\n\nI make 360s, critiques, and feedback as quantitative as possible — in derby, you have to have the ability to skate 25 laps in 5 mins to pass your skills test. It’s a tangible thing that someone can work towards and feel accomplishment for when they make it happen.\n\nThe key is to make their action-ables quantitative, even if it’s a more “soft skills” problem. For example, a report of mine had gotten feedback included “being negative and difficult to work with.” They really enjoyed the role and thought they were acting in a way that was positive and supportive. Together, we thought about why the team might feel this way when they felt otherwise and brainstormed on different ways she could demonstrate her enthusiasm for the team, the processes, and the work that was not being communicated previously. One seemingly minor goal we set was to increase the actual number of times they says “yes and…” in a workshop instead of “no, but…” Her team saw her making the effort of trying to contribute in a more constructive way and ended up supporting her growth. Identifying a skill that be can practiced and measured in a quantifiable way (decrease the amount of time you can get up from a fall) makes everyone get on board with the group’s progress.\n\n3. Provide space to exercise —\n\nIt’s important to have time set aside each week to practice your craft. I insist that the design team is given space to work out — give ourselves 1 hour a week to break out of the normal product worries and constraints. During this time, we sketch or collage, explore topical design issues, read books as a group, critique “trends.”\n\nAside from designers in danger of being put on a PIP, another challenge is when senior members of your team start feeling unchallenged. As a leader, there’s a real problem they might turn into a flight risk, endangering the cohesiveness of your team. But just like skaters, designers who get bored and complacent can always do something faster, slower, lower, and with more power, etc.. It’s my job to find ways they can push themselves — more than just giving them a link to a YouTube video of someone skating, or an online webinar on Figma tricks.\n\nFor example — sometimes doing things slow is even harder than doing them quickly. Doing a skating drill in slow motion is often more difficult because your balance is challenged in a different, more intense way. Designers sometimes need to take things back to the basics as well. I suggest returning to exercises like sketching, revisiting personas, or create some paper prototypes. It’s always great to skate against new people to test your skills or to run your designs by a new group of people. Is there a new hotness tool out in the market that could improve processes? Have them do the exploration and report back to benefit the entire team.\n\nThese sessions are not going to catapult someone into a new career trajectory, but it’s a safe place to explore things outside your comfort zone that could lead to a new track of work for the organization, keeping them engaged and helping keep your team growing as a unit\n\n4. Teach them how to fall because they will and should be falling —\n\nIn derby, we literally teach people to fall. Over and over again. You will fall — it’s just a fact of the game, and we spend a huge amount of time learning how to fall “correctly” to avoid injuries and get up quicker. We all design things that fail, or at least we should be.\n\nI’ve been lucky to work at some high-growth startups — we have theories, assumptions, and run tests against all sorts of ideas. And yes — much of the work might end up in the _archive files. Those in Growth Design (and any design for that matter) know it’s not about avoiding that failure — it’s about how you learn from them and how fast you get back up again to try another approach. Every 2 mins is a new jam to score more points — every sprint is a different chance to learn something new.\n\nIt’s my job as team leader to not only help my reports live their best life at their current company, but also set them up for success in their next lives as designers, wherever that may be. It’s important to give teammates (of every level) room to find their strengths, feedback that turns qualitative into something more quantitative and actionable, space and time to practice their skills, and not only the permission, but the assurance that they will fail.\n\nThat’s what it takes to grow a team of empowered designers that inspire each other and can become champions of their craft. Together."
