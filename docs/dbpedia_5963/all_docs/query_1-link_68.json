Please share with your Scouts as you feel appropriate. 2025 Leaders Guide Coming Soon!\n\nEvent Update\n\nEach scout should have a 4-6 ft rope, wear a Class A scout shirt, have a neckerchief & slide, and a cup (for hot chocolate). Each sled needs a patrol flag attached to a pole.\n\nWebelos do not need to use a Square Lashing to attach the crossbar to the flag pole. They can use duct tape, etc.\n\nUnits can be set up around the parade ground used for opening, Flag Station, and Sled Race. If they prefer to use a campsite with a fire pit, thatâ€™s okay.\n\nWe will be using Lawrence Lodge (the one with the Flag Pole) as our HQ. Units can use any parking lot available.\n\nIf interested in camping either Friday or Saturday night, please reach out to Marjorie Ramirez at the Council Office.\n\nFor Registration"
