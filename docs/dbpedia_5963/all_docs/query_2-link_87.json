        "text": "Derbies are limited events that occur in neighborhoods from experience level 18 onwards.\n\nEvery week, a derby (a horse race) starts between neighborhoods and give them the opportunity to win prizes. The derby stand unlocks as the player repairs the neighborhood house.\n\nDuration\n\nDerbies last 6 days, from 8am UTC on Tuesdays to 8am UTC on Mondays. During the 24-hour cool down period members can opt out, opt back in or participate in the next derby with a different neighborhood.\n\nMatching\n\nA maximum of 15 random neighborhoods compete against each other in the same league. A neighborhood is matched only with those with the same number of players who opted in to play derby, regardless of the total number of players in the neighborhood. Matching begins at the moment the first task is selected.\n\nLeagues\n\nLeagues determine the number of tasks players can complete and, consequently, the number of rewards they can get. One extra task, purchased with 10 diamonds, is available in every league.\n\nThere are five leagues:\n\nTasks\n\nMain article: Derby Tasks\n\nCompleting a task gives players derby points. There are 12 different types of tasks.\n\nTime limited tasks:\n\nFeeding animals\n\nPlanting and harvesting fields\n\nCollecting one type of animal goods\n\nMaking and collecting a specific product\n\nFilling truck orders\n\nNon-time-limited tasks:\n\nHelping other farmers with their boat orders and their dead trees and bushes\n\nExtracting ore from the mine\n\nFilling boat orders\n\nFishing with lures\n\nFully serving any type of town visitors\n\nFully serving a specific type of town visitors\n\nServing town visitors in a specific service building\n\nCombo tasks and mystery tasks\n\nCombo tasks (or basket tasks) are exactly the same types of tasks as mentioned above but less specific. For instance, instead of serving one type of town visitors 10 times, players will have to serve three types of visitors three times each. Depending on whether the original task is time-limited, the combo task will either be time-limited or not.\n\nDuring mystery derbies, some tasks remain unknown until players pick them.\n\nManaging tasks\n\nEach player can only choose one task at a time. Failing to complete a chosen task does not result in a penalty but still counts toward the player's task quota.\n\nNeighborhood leaders, co-leaders, and elders can discard any non-selected task; a new task then replaces the discarded one 30 minutes later.\n\nA player's list of completed or failed tasks is shown below the task board.\n\nNeighborhood leaders can also display the neighborhood task log in the chat panel. It ranks members according to the number of tasks they have completed and the number of points they have earned. When a neighborhood competes It also displays the total number of trashed tasks for players in the Champions League.\n\nPoints and horseshoes\n\nDerby points are won by completing tasks. Usually, tasks can give from 50 to 320 points. Players in higher leagues have more chances of getting high-value tasks on their boards (see the table below). During thematic derbies, some tasks can be worth up to 400 points.\n\nWhen a neighborhood has reached a certain number of points - or flag, they win a horseshoe (see the table below).\n\nFlags and points are displayed on the racetrack tab, which shows all neighborhood competing in the race.\n\nHorseshoe rewards\n\nRewards are won by reaching horseshoes. Each horseshoe gives players the possibility to pick one reward out of three. Players who do not complete any tasks do not get any derby rewards.\n\nRewards can be one or more supplies, products, vouchers, boosters, expansion permits, puzzle pieces, exclusive decorations or diamonds.\n\nDuring some thematic derbies, players can get better rewards or additional rewards.\n\nPlayers can use the reshuffle button to try and win different rewards by spending 5 diamonds.\n\nPlayers who did not complete at least one task during the derby cannot claim their rewards.\n\nTop 3 rewards\n\nReaching the end of the derby in first, second or third place within your league gives the neighborhood a gold, silver or bronze trophy and additional random rewards. During some thematic derbies, top 3 neighborhoods get exclusive rewards instead.\n\nLeague ladder\n\nNeighborhoods finishing a race in the top three are promoted to a higher league for the next derby.\n\nNeighborhoods ranking in the bottom three and neighborhoods which did not reach the first horseshoe checkpoint move down to a lower league.\n\nOther neighborhoods stay in their current leagues.\n\nWhen all neighborhood members have opted out of a derby, the neighborhood is automatically demoted to the lower league.\n\nChampions League leaderboard\n\nMain article: Leaderboard\n\nTop neighborhoods competing in the champions league are ranked in a global leaderboard. Scores are based on the neighborhood's average champion league points in the previous four weeks of competition. If a neighborhood is demoted to the expert league, they lose their leaderboard points.\n\nOpting out\n\nPlayers can opt out of the derby, or opt back in, at any time by (un)checking the appropriate option in their settings.\n\nPlayers who have been inactive for a while are automatically opted out.\n\nNeighborhood leaders and co-leaders can opt out members of their neighborhood. Members can opt back in if they want to. Co-leaders cannot opt leaders out.\n\nAchievements\n\nMain article: Achievements\n\nAchieving tasks contributes toward the Taskmaster achievement.\n\nAccumulating points contributes toward the Diligent Neighbor achievement.\n\nParticipating in Champions League derbies contributes toward the Derby Champ achievement.\n\nStrategy tips\n\nComplete the task first, or go through the task midway, then select your event to save time.\n\nCoordinate with other members so you can help each other out.\n\nNeighborhoods with less than 4 members opting in cannot reach some horseshoe flags even if every member only picks 320-point tasks. This is a known limitation.\n\nNeighborhoods with 3 members opting in and completing ten 320-point tasks can reach the 8th horseshoe. Note that usually the 9th horseshoe reward usually does not include anything special such as expansion permits, puzzle pieces, boosters or special decorative items.\n\nIt appears that horseshoe rewards currently follow this pattern. If a puzzle piece is included, it would appear at the 3rd and 6th horseshoes. Boosters are likely to appear at the 4th and 7th horseshoes. If an expansion permit is included, it would appear at the 5th and 8th horseshoes. So if you were interested in only expansion permits and puzzle pieces, you do not need to have more than 3 members opt in as the 9th horseshoe will not give you what you are looking for.\n\nDepending on your neighborhood's initial size and the league you're in it might be easier to move up the league ladder with more opted-in players, or oddly enough, less of them. Opted-out players can help opt-in players with some tasks (providing items for town, truck and boat orders, setting plants to be revived, making specific vistors available for pick up, etc.).\n\nTutorials\n\nTable of task probabilities\n\nLeague Easy\n\n(50-90) Medium\n\n(120-190) Hard\n\n(230-320) Rookie 30% 30% 40% Novice 20% 30% 50% Professional 15% 25% 60% Expert 10% 20% 70% Champion 0% 0% 100%\n\nTable of derby checkpoints\n\nThis table lists the number of derby points neighborhoods must reach in the Champions League at each checkpoint according to their size.\n\nNo. of members Flag #1 Flag #2 Flag #3 Flag #4 Flag #5 Flag #6 Flag #7 Flag #8 Flag #9 1 450 792 1,134 1,476 1,818 2,160 2,502 2,925 3,186 2 900 1,584 2,268 2,952 3,636 4,320 5,004 5,850 6,372 3 1,350 2,376 3,402 4,428 5,454 6,480 7,506 8,532 9,558 4 1,800 3,024 4,248 5,472 6,696 7,920 9,144 10,368 11,520 5 2,250 3,735 5,220 6,705 8,190 9,675 11,160 12,645 13,950 6 2,700 4,482 6,264 8,046 9,828 11,610 13,392 15,174 16,740 7 2,835 4,851 6,867 8,883 10,899 12,915 14,931 16,947 18,900 8 3,240 5,544 7,848 10,152 12,456 14,760 17,064 19,368 21,600 9 3,645 6,237 8,829 11,421 14,013 16,605 19,197 21,789 24,300 10 4,050 6,930 9,810 12,690 15,570 18,450 21,330 24,210 26,550 11 4,455 7,623 10,791 13,959 17,127 20,295 23,463 26,631 29,205 12 4,860 8,316 11,772 15,228 18,684 22,140 25,596 29,052 31,860 13 4,680 8,424 12,168 15,912 19,656 23,400 27,144 30,888 34,515 14 5,040 9,072 13,104 17,136 21,168 25,200 29,232 33,264 36,540 15 5,400 9,720 14,040 18,360 22,680 27,000 31,320 35,640 39,150 16 5,760 10,368 14,976 19,584 24,192 28,800 33,408 38,016 41,760 17 6,120 11,016 15,912 20,808 25,704 30,600 35,496 40,392 44,370 18 6,480 11,664 16,848 22,032 27,216 32,400 37,584 42,768 46,980 19 5,985 11,457 16,929 22,401 27,873 33,345 38,817 44,289 49,590 20 6,300 12,060 17,820 23,580 29,340 35,100 40,860 46,620 52,200 21 6,615 12,663 18,711 24,759 30,807 36,855 42,903 48,951 54,810 22 6,930 13,266 19,602 25,938 32,274 38,610 44,946 51,282 57,420 23 7,245 13,869 20,493 27,117 33,741 40,365 46,989 53,613 58,995 24 7,560 14,472 21,384 28,296 35,208 42,120 49,032 55,944 61,560 25 7,875 15,075 22,275 29,475 36,675 43,875 51,075 58,275 64,125 26 7,020 14,508 21,996 29,484 36,972 44,460 51,948 59,436 66,690 27 7,290 15,066 22,842 30,618 38,394 46,170 53,946 61,722 69,255 28 7,560 15,624 23,688 31,752 39,816 47,880 55,944 64,008 71,820 29 7,830 16,182 24,534 32,886 41,238 49,590 57,942 66,294 74,385 30 8,100 16,740 25,380 34,020 42,660 51,300 59,940 68,580 76,950\n\nReferences\n\nSupercell FAQs about derbies\n\nSupercell Player Support: Leagues: Derby Task Probability\n\nSee also"
