        "text": "AI assistants\n\nThe council has already been working with ICS.AI on two AI assistants: Darcie for the council’s customer service centre, and Ali for Derby Homes housing enquiries. These digital assistants will be upgraded and expanded, and the council will also use AI to answer emails quickly, or flag them with colleagues to deal with.\n\nThe council will also use AI to support debt recovery by allowing it to gather and analyse information from across all of its systems in a more timely manner than staff can currently achieve.\n\nWith this AI assistance, the council will be able to identify where it needs to offer support to minimise debt, and maximise income collection, it said.\n\nThe first phase is expected to be in place in four months, with plans to roll out phases two and three across other services once it is running successfully. The priority then will be widening its adoption further, the council said, before adding that a human would always be involved when it came to decision-making.\n\nThe new contract with ICS.AI is expected to generate £3.925m in savings during the 2024/25 financial year, and this figure is expected to rise to a minimum of £12.25m annually once the project is fully delivered.\n\nSimpson said after seeing the potential to use GenAI across the wider council with Darcie and Ali, it commissioned ICS.AI to conduct a number of discovery workshops, which helped to find more specific business cases where AI could help enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs and deliver cumulative cost savings.\n\nRead more about tech at local government level\n\nCanterbury, Dover and Thanet Councils in Kent have all been struck by simultaneous cyber attacks knocking systems offline, with indications of a link between all three.\n\nAmazon Web Services is seeking to accelerate the pace of cloud adoption by local authorities across the UK, Ireland and Spain by offering them a three-month free trial of its infrastructure and software services.\n\nIn all, 261 AI opportunities were identified at the discovery workshops, of which 54 AI offerings have now been proposed to deliver significant savings. The plan to deliver the AI transformation programme is 18 months, split across the three phases.\n\nDarcie and Ali have already proved to be a success for the council.\n\nWhile inbound phone calls account for more than 60% of residents’ contact with the council, most of those calls ask similar questions or are requests about a small number of services. Many calls often have a straightforward answer.\n\nThe council has already handled over half a million telephone and web queries with these assistants, resolving 43% of enquiries without input from staff – double the initial target for the project – and saving the council £200,000. More than 4,000 of these queries were handled outside of normal hours.\n\nPreviously, the phone system used a recorded message that gave callers a list of numbered options.\n\nThe AI assistants introduced in April last year instead try to understand the query, and if there is an online answer, it’s able to send it in a text, or otherwise redirect the call to one of 40 different departments.\n\nHowever, these copilots will not be the only option for people who want to contact the council, as people will always be able to speak to a member of staff, or see someone face-to-face, during business hours if they prefer.\n\nReducing demand on operators\n\nSimpson said that as well as the cost savings, the digital assistants have reduced demand on human operators, releasing time for them to spend with residents with more complex needs. Meanwhile, the intelligence the council gets from the digital assistants, which it did not have access to before, has helped it change and adjust the services it’s providing for citizens.\n\nThe council is still developing the digital assistants based on customer feedback. For example, where people have had a less-than-positive experience with using the AI, it has found that sometimes the questions asked are too complex for the AI to deal with, and needed a human instead. He said it’s important for the council to continue to get the message across about what the assistant is designed to do.\n\n“We are one of the first in the local government sector to begin this journey, so are pioneering, finding the way and dealing with the emerging challenges,” said Simpson. “However, the upside is that we will see the benefits before anyone else, and be able to share that learning with the sector.”\n\nHe said the overall reaction from the public so far has been like a microcosm of the wider debate around the use of AI. “There is interest in its potential, but also cautiousness about the unknown, which is understandable,” said Simpson.\n\n“For us as a council, use of generative AI presents huge opportunities at a time when the government is calling on the public sector to increase productivity, and local authorities continue to face financial challenges. We are however aware of the risks and will work to mitigate these. It’s vital that we bring our customers and colleagues on this journey with us.”"
