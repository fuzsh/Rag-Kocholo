They informed expenditures of approximately $70 million in federal, state, local and international robot procurements.\n\nS&T transitions the Reverse Velocity Jet Tamper (ReVJeT) to all U.S. public safety bomb squads. The counter-improvised explosive device tool has a more precise and concentrated propellant stream that disrupts explosives to keep them from detonating and causing harm or damage. ReVJeT improves upon existing platforms by a conservative 300%.\n\nS&T announces both the launch of the $1.55 million Opioid Detection Challenge—a multi-agency effort to develop rapid, nonintrusive detection tools that track illicit opioids being trafficked into the U.S. through international mail—and the prize-winning technologies.\n\nS&T’s groundbreaking Rapid DNA technology is used in the aftermath of the Camp Fire wildfire in Paradise, California, and the Conception boat fire off the coast of Santa Cruz Island, California, to help agencies identify victims of the mass casualty events.\n\nThe DHS Small Business Innovation Research program awards its 1,000th contract, signifying the Department’s commitment to and investment in the nation’s small businesses and innovators. Under S&T’s leadership, the program has invested more than $380 million to-date to foster economic growth while addressing homeland security technology needs.\n\nS&T’s Team Awareness Kit (TAK) technology was used by the Coast Guard to rescue 46 ice fishermen on Lake Erie. The mobile TAK app allows agencies to securely exchange data, take and disseminate photos and video, map personnel deployment, and improve overall real-time situational awareness to inform tactical decisions. TAK has also been used to support response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Dorian, secure Super Bowls, and strengthen border security.\n\nS&T supports the Department’s—and the nation’s—pandemic response, developing research-based, mission-driven tools for decision makers and frontline workers. S&T releases and continues to update the COVID-19 Master Question List (MQL), curates resources for first responders, develops interactive online virus survivability calculators, and publishes scientific studies that continually shape how the virus is categorized.\n\nS&T releases the Resilient Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Conformance Framework, used to inform the design and adoption of PNT systems and to help our nation’s critical infrastructure become more resilient to disruptions like GPS jamming and spoofing.\n\nS&T launches Hacking for Homeland Security, an entrepreneurship program that engages students from leading universities to develop innovative solutions to mission-critical homeland security challenges. Undergraduate and graduate student teams work closely with DHS, business mentors, and trained faculty in a semester-long course, applying an entrepreneurial approach to their project-based courses.\n\nS&T transitions next-generation explosives trace detection (ETD) technology to DARPA. The mass spectrometry ETD technology’s initial use case was for security operations, including aviation checkpoints and border crossings, but the program team soon realized it could easily be modified to keep warfighters and the nation safe from weapons of mass destruction threats.\n\nS&T successfully field-tested prototype technologies for early detection of wildfires. The effort by S&T’s Smart Cities Internet of Things Innovation Labs, in partnership with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and The Nature Conservancy, as well as the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Fire Administration, will arm response agencies with sensor technology that will significantly reduce the time it takes from detection to response.\n\nS&T publishes groundbreaking COVID-19 environmental studies that demonstrate the effects of heat, humidity, and sunlight on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. S&T also joins a multiagency wastewater-based epidemiology coalition to gather virus data from sewer systems and standardize the science to better understand and contain community spread.\n\nS&T develops and releases new Master Question Lists for African Swine Fever and Synthetic Opioids. Like the COVID-19 MQL released in 2020, these documents summarize what is known about both issues so experts can quickly find knowledge gaps and identify solutions.\n\nTwo award-winning, next-generation checkpoint screening technologies are licensed for commercialization—the Shoe Scanner and the High Definition-Advanced Imaging System. The two represent significant S&T investments in aviation security, enhancing the passenger screening process and reducing false alarms.\n\nS&T, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and NYC transit and emergency response partners begin an air sampling study that will impact how urban areas prepare for and recover from chemical or biological incidents. Results will help refine and verify airflow and dispersion models to inform response protocols and protect citizens and critical infrastructure. Related studies also help to determine the most effective measures to reduce the spread of viruses, including COVID-19, on public transit.\n\nDr. Dimitri Kusnezov is confirmed as the fifth Under Secretary for Science and Technology.\n\nTechnologies developed by S&T and Homeland Security Investigations lead to the arrest of traffickers and several children rescued in the Philippines. The tools and algorithms allow agents to streamline investigations, aggregate huge amounts of data, and build cohesive cases.\n\nS&T and the U.S. Army partner to open the new, experimental Chemical Security Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground. The facility will help CSAC and military experts take a holistic approach to validating scientific data and produce findings that are essential to national readiness.\n\nS&T transitions an advanced, compact carry-on baggage screening system to the Transportation Security Administration. The Reduced Form Factor-Computed Tomography system, developed via S&T’s Screening at Speed Program, delivers the benefits of CT to smaller, regional airports that may not be able to fit conventional scanning systems.\n\nS&T launches the sweeping Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Research program, leveraging $157.5 million in funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
