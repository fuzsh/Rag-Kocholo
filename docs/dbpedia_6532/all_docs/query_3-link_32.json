        "text": "Learn how societies and cultures of the past help us understand present day events\n\nWe are all historians. From remembering your name to where you parked your car, your sense of what has occurred in the past makes it possible for you to find the right words and make well informed personal and work decisions.\n\nThe value of history cannot be overstated. Without it you cannot understand a culture, a country or the world. Not to mention yourself.\n\nInterested in becoming a teacher? Take a look at our B.S./M.S. Dual Degree Program which allows students interested in the teaching profession to earn both a bachelor's and master's degree at an accelerated pace.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming an English teacher, you are already part way there, students who major as undergraduates in English may receive certification in Secondary Education, Childhood Education or Early Childhood Education.\n\nStudents who choose to minor in the history concentration must complete:\n\nStudents must take 4 courses at the 200 level and above slotted under the five fields of study: United States, Europe, Asia, Atlantic World and Ideas, Theories and Practices.\n\nIn addition, History Minors are required to take HIST 220: \"Method in the Madness\" : An Introduction to Historical Research, a course focused upon historical methodology. This requires successful completion of ENGL 111. History minors are not required to take HIST 320 or HIST 495.\n\nHistory majors planning on pursuing a career in teaching Social Studies at the Middle Childhood and/or Adolescence Education level may apply to the Four-Plus-One Program, offered jointly by the School of Education and the School of Liberal Arts. The program is designed to allow majors to begin their Graduate Education coursework during their upper junior year. These courses will be counted jointly toward their undergraduate and graduate degrees. For specific program eligibility and requirements, please refer to the School of Education of this catalog."
