        "text": "Sign up for the daily newsletter, Jay's Plays of the Day, to get sports betting recommendations for the top games of the night and the week ahead.\n\nGolden moments\n\nThe Olympics are awesome; the contests have had me from the start. But I did not have to swim in the Seine. Yuck.\n\nI have even stopped my \"NCIS\" binge-watching to keep up with the Paris Games. Let's go to the highlights.\n\n› So this was from the weekend and not Monday, but I think it deserves more discussion. Should winning an Olympic Gold be considered a major? Heck, Scottie Scheffler has multiple majors — and a coveted Green Jacket — and the only time I have seen him cry was winning Gold for the ol' USA over the weekend. Thoughts?\n\n› Simone Biles won a medal. Yawn. Kidding, of course. Question for the group: Simone Biles doing this — all of this — at age 27 in gymnastics > TB12 winning a Super Bowl as QB1 at 44? Discuss.\n\n› Noah Lyles is him. Period. And yes, I think someone needs to do a commercial about him running to the mailbox and Amazon or FedEx or UPS getting there before he does. Wait, crap. I could make way more money in marketing.\n\n› The US won gold in surfing Monday. I watched. I have no opinion on the efforts. Congrats, young lady. Surfing is not a sport and has no place in the Games.\n\n› OK, we discussed the balance beam as being the hardest thing out there. Where does the pole vault land in those rankings? I could try the beam, but I have zero chance to even pick up the pole. Shut up, Spy.\n\nRules, rules\n\nSo Kentucky cheated. In football and in swimming.\n\n(Side question: Why do you cheat in swimming? Moreover, how do you get caught cheating in swimming? \"Hey, recruit, here's $20K in your Speedo.\")\n\n(Side question, part II: If you are going to cheat, why are you fighting to get to eight wins? Cheat to be great, right?)\n\nHere's the thing. What is cheating these days? Look back at Bruce Pearl at UT about the lies about a backyard BBQ and the coverup. Compare that to today. We're thinking Uncle Bruce is a congenial host, right?\n\nWhether we realize it or not, this may be the biggest threat to the future of college sports as we know it.\n\nNot the NIL. Not the portal. Not Title IX.\n\nWhen the rulers become completely meaningless and when there is no one there to try to apply those meaningless rules, the system becomes clear.\n\nBigger and richer > everyone else.\n\nThoughts.\n\nHall of mirrors\n\nSo we touched on the NFL Hall of Fame inductions on Monday.\n\nClear caveat, even being in the Hall of Fame discussion — in anything — is great praise. Not to go all Susan Lucci, but even being nominated is an honor.\n\nBut the NFL Hall process is broken. I am not even referring to the excellent observation from BackupQB about Steve McMichael getting inducted from his bed. (Side question on True or False Tuesday: BackupQB should be referred to as QB2 from this point forward. Discuss.)\n\nThere are too many worthy candidates waiting in the wings. There are too many mediocre candidates getting preferential treatment. There are too many ...\n\nForget all of that. Make it right.\n\nRight now.\n\nThis and that\n\n› Buckets, did we just hit a 3-0 night on Jay's Plays? Wait. Don't answer that. The first rule of Fight Club is ... You know.\n\n› Good thing we are — wait, Fight Club — but the markets are in free fall. Yikes.\n\n› You know the rules. Here's Paschall on the UT offensive line, which figures to be a strength for the crew in the 865.\n\n› Great back and forth on Monday, even though I was late to the party. Work, and all. Will say this: It was flat-out dumb for Trump to pick a fight with Brian Kemp. I saw it bubble up on social media when UGA football fan noted that Kemp is a UGA grad and diehard Dawg. If Trump thinks his supporters are going to eschew their college football fandom, then he is misinformed. (Insert Chas comment here.)\n\nToday's questions\n\nTrue or false, it's Tuesday. Morning, Ernie.\n\nTrue or false: Oregon will be in the college football playoff.\n\nTrue or false: If you had a vote in the preseason poll, you would vote UGA 1.\n\nTrue or false: The Olympics should be considered a golf major.\n\nTrue or false: Aaron Judge is an absolute beast.\n\nYou know the drill. Answer some T or Fs. Ask some T or Fs.\n\nAs for today, Aug. 6, let's review.\n\nDang, one of the Spice Girls is 52 today. That makes you feel old.\n\nWell, on this day in 1945, we dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.\n\nRushmore of \"bombs\" in all measures.\n\nYou guys and gals are great."
