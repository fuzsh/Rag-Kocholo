        "text": "Matias Moellenbach, an emerging furniture and interior design brand from Copenhagen, strives to produce unique and durable items. The brand is known for its diverse range of interior objects, reflecting a commitment to exploring beyond a single medium. This approach is clearly visible in the studio's product lineup. In that past year, textiles have has notably become a focus of intense interest, marking a significant theme in the studio's latest releases. This exhibition will naturally showcase new textiles, alongside furniture and lighting pieces.\n\nThe centre of this year exhibition will be the release of the multi-material Assembly Furniture Series. \"The Assembly Side table earns its name due to its ability to be assembled without requiring additional components. Its joints firmly lock together, providing structural integrity and optimal functionality. Its minimalist design allows for quick and effortless assembly, all without sacrificing stability and durability.\" Matias Moellenbach will open his brand new showroom in the beautiful and historical settings at Frederiksgade.\n\nSince its inception in 2013, Signe Byrdal Terenziani has facilitated the growth of the design community in her role as Managing Director. It all began as a small design event held in an old warehouse in Nordhavn, a harbour area overlooking Copenhagenâs waterfront. Four Danish brands launched the event as a joint initiative: Montana, Erik JÃ¸rgensen (now owned by Fredericia Furniture), Anker & Co, and Kvadrat. At that time, Copenhagen lacked a proper design festival, since the previous annual furniture fair at Bella Center closed down some years before.\n\nToday, the 3daysofdesign festival extends to the entire city of Copenhagen and is considered the most significant annual design festival in Scandinavia.\n\nâ\n\nPack your bags, book a hotel and come to Copenhagen! 3daysofdesign is open to the general public and everyone is invited to visit the showrooms, exhibitions, workshops and design talks.
