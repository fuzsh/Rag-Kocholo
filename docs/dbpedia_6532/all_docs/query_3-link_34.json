As an associate research scientist at Yale University from 1995 to 1998 he carried out precision measurements of muonium hyperfine structure at Los Alamos National Laboratory and of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). He was a research scientist at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, from 1998 to 1999 and then through 2007 a Fellow at the joint Japanese-American RIKEN-BNL Research Center (RBRC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. He joined the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois in 2002.\n\nAt RBRC and Illinois Professor Grosse Perdekamp has studied the physics of the strong interaction and the spin-structure of its bound states through high energy scattering experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL on Long Island, NY and the B-Factory at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. Most recently, he has joined the COMPASS experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN (2012) and the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva Switzerland (2016).\n\nProfessor Grosse Perdekamp and his group at UIUC have developed and built instruments for the detection of ionizing radiation for the PHENIX experiment at RHIC and the COMPASS experiment at CERN. Currently the group carries out R&D for an upgrade of the Zero Degree Calorimeter in ATLAS. Grosse Perdekamp studies possible applications of this instrumentation for the detection of fissile materials. He has been teaching a course on Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control since 2012 and is a member of the core faculty of the UIUC program for Arms Control, Disarmament, and International Security (ACDIS).\n\nOther Professional Employment\n\nRIKEN Fellow, Brookhaven National Lab, 2000-2002\n\nSelected Articles in Journals"
