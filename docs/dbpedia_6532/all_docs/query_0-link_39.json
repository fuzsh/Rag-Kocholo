It seems like the full process is something like:\n\nCreate new column.\n\nCreate new item and set new a new label with a ‘create_labels_if_missing: true’ option.\n\nUse ‘change_multiple_column_values’ to create the rest of the labels.\n\nDelete the new item from step 2.\n\nThe problem with this is that I still have the existing labels that are created by default with the column. I haven’t found a way to delete them or just change them rather than creating new ones. If there’s no way to do this it’s a major problem and please consider this a feature request!\n\nHello there,\n\nMatias here!\n\nAs of today there is no way of deleting specific labels via API.\n\nI have added your vote for this request\n\nIf it gets implemented, it will be announced in our changelog.\n\nCheers,\n\nMatias\n\nGreat, looking forward to that. In the meantime can I change the index of the existing labels. or can I assign the index as I create them? The idea here would be to put the newly created labels at the top of choices. Thanks for all your help.\n\nHello again @Janssen,\n\nWhen you create a new Status label, it will follow the default index value and its index will not change. You can not change the index of existing labels or assign the index when you create them.\n\nI will add your vote for this request as well!\n\nCheers,\n\nMatias\n\n@Matias.Monday It started as a joke , but now I think this could be a great idea. On the vote system you could add a button to identify how many people would be willing to pay for a new feature, and then your commercial could list leads and compare development costs and share it among the people who want it. Monday would pay for a X percent and the rest by the community. Like a “Monday GoFoundMe”. What do you think?"
