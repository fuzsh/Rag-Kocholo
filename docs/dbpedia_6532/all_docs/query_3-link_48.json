        "text": "I have imported over 1000 contacts to the platform with all the information from the previous CRM, it is a quite completed data base up to date that we have spent weeks sorting in preparation to the migration.\n\nI am using the CRM template. I imported all the contacts from a CSV, and I have added each of them to an exisiting account from a separate board from the CRM template.\n\nOn the “Contacts Board” I can see all the contacts added to the accounts, but on the “Accounts board” I can’t see the contacts added although those two columns are connected.\n\nThere must be a way to see existing contacts linked to the organization as they are already linked on the Contacts board. If there isn’t, is there a way to link over 1000 contacts to existing organizations in bulk to visualize known contacts of a given account?\n\nThank you\n\nHi there! I understand that you’re facing an issue where the contacts added to the accounts are not visible on the Accounts board, even though the columns are connected.\n\nTo ensure that the contacts linked to an organization are visible on the Accounts board, you need to make sure that the boards are properly connected and the necessary columns are set up correctly. Here’s what you can check:\n\nDouble-check the Connection: Verify that the connection between the Contacts board and the Accounts board is established correctly. Ensure that the connection is set up to display the linked contacts on the Accounts board.\n\nVerify Column Configuration: On the Accounts board, check if the column that displays the linked contacts is properly configured to show the related information. If necessary, adjust the column settings to display the linked contacts.\n\nCross-Board Linking: Ensure that the linking between contacts and accounts is set up correctly. Each contact should be linked to the corresponding account on the Contacts board. Make sure that the linking is done consistently for all contacts.\n\nIf the above steps don’t resolve the issue, there might be a need for further investigation. Our team specializes in custom monday.com integration and development services and can help you troubleshoot and find a solution to ensure that the contacts linked to organizations are visible on the Accounts board.\n\nRegarding your question about linking over 1000 contacts to existing organizations in bulk, monday.com does not have a bulk linking feature by default. However, with our custom monday.com development services, we can explore the possibility of creating a custom solution to streamline and automate the process of linking multiple contacts to existing organizations.\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out if you would like to discuss your requirements in more detail or if you have any further questions. We’re here to assist you and help you visualize the known contacts of a given account.\n\nHey Glenn,\n\nThanks for raising this! If I am understanding your situation correctly, can you please try adjusting the recipe so that it instead of overwriting the matched value, it adds a new matched item? I have tested this on my end and was able to connect multiple contacts to the one account through a matched value.\n\nLet me know how you go\n\nBianca, this was super helpful. I am having one more level of complexity that I cannot figure out.\n\nSo lets say multiple prospects are uploaded to the leads board. They happen to be from the same company, each individual lead is its own task. A lead then has been contacted and moves to qualified and becomes an opportunity.\n\nhow do i identify the prospects/leads that are in the same company after contact has been made? I have the identifier formula column, but I cannot figure out what the TRIGGER is to continually check that connection?"
