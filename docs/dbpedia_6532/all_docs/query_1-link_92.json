I use it several times a week.\n\nAnother week goes by, and another week that the taco sauce isn’t available to purchase online. I’ve been checking every week for months, what’s taking so long???\n\nOrtega just isn’t the same, I need this sauce in my life again!!\n\nLike others have said, I found and tried this sauce loved it bought 2 more jars and never saw it again. I would pay shipping to have these mailed to me. I really hope the sauce is not discontinued I really think its the best I've tried. If discontinued, could I have the recipe?\n\nHave been eating this for a few years now but can't always find the Cantina style that my wife loves. Not an issue, just order it directly from their site.\n\nPlease don't change a thing...everything I find something so good \"they\" try and improve it...and don't....this is from a ketchup only white boy....now it is all about the Mateo's....my favorite salad dressing\n\nI have never found a salsa I liked because I do not like salsa until Mateo's. I have practically bought and tried every salsa in the store and they basically all tasted the same - bland. Mateo's is totally different. Main problem is that once I open the jar, I have to pour a liberal amount in a bowl, or I would not stop until the jar is empty. I switch what kind I purchase. The most recent WAS (it's gone) the mild.\n\nI used to make my own salsa, & I came across Mateo’s & now I do not have to dirty up my kitchen. Thank you foe making the best tasting salsa! ❤️\n\nPlease come out with a variety pack! My husband really likes the yellow label because he can get it at Costco but he’s willing to try the other ones but he doesn’t want to be stuck with 6 jars of the same thing if he doesn’t care for the other flavors\n\nThere are several salsas I like but this one is by far my favorite.
