        "text": "PEPPERS - for processing or fresh market\n\n1/2 lb/227 gr of seed is required for an acre of transplants\n\n3,500 - 4,000 seeds per oz/28 gr\n\nGREENHOUSE: Sow in hot beds, greenhouse benches or flats from Feb. to Mar. 15th. Germinate in Jiffy Mix or sterilized soil @ 70°F/20°C soil temp. for 14 days. Sow seed about 0.25 in/6 mm deep @ 8 seeds per in/25 mm, cover and firm lightly. Sow as thinly as possible for healthier seedlings. Cover seed flats or benches with plastic to conserve moisture, remove covering as soon as germination occurs. Always use tempered water when watering. Transplant seedlings into benches or flats when the true leaves are about 3/8 in/10 mm in diameter. Grow seedlings @ 70°F/20°C, reduce moisture slightly to harden off. Keep peppers in a well ventilated area and maintain a night greenhouse temp. of above 62°F/17°C. Never let the plants wilt! Root systems are sensitive and rather slow growing so any check in growth will cost you dearly in total yields. Keep the plant warm and encourage growth with liquid fertilizer feedings every 2 weeks.\n\nTRANSPLANT into the field 12-18 in/30-45 cm apart in 30 in/75 cm rows after June 15th. Early cold June nights cause blossoms to drop off before pollination, producing huge bushy plants without peppers. Control cutworms before planting."
