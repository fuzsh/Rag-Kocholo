        "text": "Roma has certainly seen her fair share of magical players over the years. From speed demons like Mohamed Salah to the creative but combustible Antonio Cassano to latter-day playmakers like Henrikh Mkhitaryan and, of course, the ultimate fantasista Francesco Totti, the Giallorossi have proudly boasted some of the game's most creative talents over the years.\n\nWhile his Roma career hasn't officially begun yet, Matías Soulé, the 21-year-old Argentinian whiz signed from Juventus last month, seems poised to join that lineage already. Although he's only been in Trigoria a short time, Soulé's magic has been on full display in Roma's pre-season. Whether on the training pitch or in Roma's pre-season tour of Europe, Soulé has dazzled fans with an array of clever dribbles, precisely placed through balls, his sublime first touch, and an almost extrasensory connection with Paulo Dybala.\n\nWe can't make definitive judgments based on a handful of pre-season friendlies, but Soulé is already making his mark under Daniele De Rossi and should loom large in his plans for the season ahead. To gain some additional insight into what Soulé brings to the table, we turned to our friend and Juventus expert Danny at Black, White & Read All Over. Danny was kind enough to lend us his time and shed some light on what type of player Roma recruited.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSoule didn’t feature much for Juve over the years but tell us where he settled into the club’s long-term plans before the sale. Was he a genuine building block, or was he always likely to be transfer fodder?\n\nIt’s hard to say where Soulé fit into the long-term plans because he joined the club at a time in which the front office that signed him are very much not the front office that sold him. And maybe more important than that, Soulé came to Juventus at a time in which the club’s finances are, pardon my French, in the absolute shit. Because of that, Juve barely did anything last summer, and it’s always been assumed that they’re going to need to both shed some salary and sell players if they want to buy some of the bigger targets this summer.\n\nWhere Soulé fit into this was always going to be a giant question mark. The world of football these days is so much about profits on the books as well as what’s going on the field. So, because Soulé was signed for next to nothing back when he was a teenager coming over to Italy from Argentina, they were going to make a huge profit on the books no matter how much they sold him for. And with his season at Frosinone, it was the perfect audition to either show he’s ready for a chance at Juventus or to be flipped to another club this summer. We clearly know how that turned out — and Juve got a nice €22.4 million profit on the books because of it.\n\nBased on what you have seen of Soule, what would you say are his strengths and areas for improvement? Was there a role available for him under Motta this season?\n\nEasy — it’s his dribbling and creativity. That is what made his big first half of the 2023-24 season at Frosinone so effective. He started like gangbusters and basically became the go-to guy for Frosinone to try and make things happen. For a large portion of the season, Soulé did just that. Admittedly, he couldn’t keep that up and certainly faded — as Frosinone also did on their way to getting relegated to Serie B — as the second half of the season went on.\n\nSo the thing I would say improvement-wise for him is if he can keep that kind of impressive form going for more of the season rather than falling off like he did. You would think being on a better team like Roma would give him a better chance of that. As well as playing of the likes of Paulo Dybala — still miss u buddy — and the other attackers that Roma are building their attack around would make you think that’s possible. But again, he’s actually gotta go out and do it because we all know the kind of reception he got at the airport in Rome is going to create some massive expectations.\n\nIn addition to selling Soulé, we’ve heard rumbles all summer of a Federico Chiesa sale, but why was Juve so eager to get rid of two young and impactful players? Was this all about funding the Teun Koopmeiners purchase?\n\nThe Chiesa situation is a little bit like Soulé in that his potential sale would fuel some other business, but it’s also very different for one big reason. That would be Chiesa’s contract situation. We’ve talked a whole lot this summer on the podcast about how Chiesa’s contract situation has to have played a big role in Juventus being very much open to selling their No. 7 and probably best attacking player. Chiesa has one year left on his current deal and Juve and Chiesa’s agent seem to be at a standstill in terms of a potential salary. Chiesa wants a raise and to be paid close to what Dusan Vlahovic makes. Juventus clearly don’t agree. That means Juve would rather sell him for some sort of profit and transfer fee rather than take a huge risk of potentially seeing him sign on a free transfer somewhere else in January.\n\nLike Soulé, the money that comes with selling Chiesa would allow Juve to do other things on the transfer market — at least in theory. But if Thiago Motta wants to play with wingers, then selling your best winger just to sign somebody who might cost just as much seems a little perplexing, I guess. Then again, it’s not like I ever expected Juve to be in the position of ever thinking about selling Chiesa a couple of years ago, so what am I to think anymore\n\nGoing along with that, between Soule and Dean Huijsen, Juve sold two promising players to land Koopmeiners. Is there any chance they’ll live to regret that, or is he that important for Motta’s plans?\n\nI feel like there would be more regret amongst the fan base rather than from Motta or those in the front office because that’s just the general nature of how things are these days. Juventus were always going to be in a position where there had to be a few sacrificial pieces so that they could remake a large portion of the roster, and it turned out that the likes of Soulé, Huijsen and others like Chiesa are going to bring in money to do business.\n\nIt was good to see that Juve got important business on the transfer market done early. They made the Douglas Luiz deal done before the month of June ended for multiple reasons. They signed Michele Di Gregorio and Khephren Thuram early in July as well. It was an early wave of business in which we thought could translate to a lot of the business being done early. But because of the limited funds available, selling players to finish the work on the market was a must. So now, a lot of the players Juve want like Koopmeiners have been held up until sales were made. We’ll just see if Atalanta agrees to things since they know Juve are rather desperate to sign Koop.\n\nFinally, are there any other young Juve players Serie A fans should keep an eye on this season? Are there any new Huijsens or Soules ready to make their mark?\n\nIt’s hard to say right now because so much of the roster seems uncertain. I wouldn’t be surprised if a few players from the Next Gen squad bounce between the senior team and Serie C simply to provide some depth. But if there’s one to focus on, it’s probably Vasilije Adžić, an 18-year-old attacker from Montenegro who finally welcomed this summer after essentially agreeing to a deal for him back in January. He’s reportedly been very impressive in training and Motta is already thinking that his time with the Next Gen squad could be a short one. And knowing that depth in attack is quite thin at the moment, that could very well be a forced move rather than by choice."
