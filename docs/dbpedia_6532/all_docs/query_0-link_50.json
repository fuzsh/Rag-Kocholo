        "text": "Every week I take my son to Chik-fil-A. For those who never heard it, it just a fast food restaurant. What it amazes me every time I go is their effort to please their\n\ncostumers. From spotless bathroom to friendly and caring staff, fast service, goody bag for kids, small but safe playground for the little ones, food delivery to the table so\n\nyou don't need to juggle between holding your food tray, pocket book and your kids hands and so many other advantages . Today for instance because they delayed the\n\norder by 3 minutes and they gave us free sandwich to use at my convenience. For this reasons they always make me overstay and wanting to come back. I always have a\n\nGOOD EXPERIENCE. But why am I saying all of that?\n\nBecause that is exactly what I strive to achieve to every single one of my clients\n\nIts not just delivering images\n\nFrom the minute a potential client contact me to the actual booking and delivery of the images I make sure to put all my heart to satisfy them in every step of the way.\n\nMy clients can chat with me and exchanges ideas and concerns every time of day.\n\nI will help with wardrobe choices , not only for the moms specially to be able to take that concern off their shoulders but I also want the images to look timeless for the family.\n\nBefore during and after the photoshoot I prepare and educate my client very well. I do not put a time length on my sessions because I just want the family to relax and enjoy\n\nthe experience to be there with their loved ones!\n\nkids are allowed to be kids !! yeah that's right !! Why would I want to have a child to look at me and say cheese !! how boring is that? I want them running , hugging, kissing\n\nand playing! That is how the parents want to remember them!!!\n\nWhy do I do all of this ?\n\nBecause I care!! I love to bring all sort of emotions to my clients eyes when they see their gallery and the only way I can provoque that is providing an AMAZING\n\nEXPERIENCE.\n\nBROWSE MY PORTFOLIO to get to know more of my work\n\nDo you want to feel special and taken care of?"
