        "text": "Matias Simons studied medicine in Heidelberg, Germany and then moved into nephrology after performing his MD thesis in renal research. “During this time I realized that it is really difficult to handle both research and clinical work simultaneously, said Matias Simons. Therefore I decided to focus only on research.”\n\n“In my first post-doc, I discovered a link between cystic renal diseases and a pathway that commands planar polarity in epithelia,” said Matias Simons. Mutations of a protein called inversin cause nephronophthisis type II, an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease characterized by extensive renal cysts, situs inversus and renal failure. They showed that inversin acts as a molecular switch between different Wnt signaling cascades.\n\nHe then used Drosophila in his second post-doc and with his own research team to study planar polarity in more detail. In 2013, he heard about the creation of a new institute in Paris dedicated to genetic diseases: Imagine Institute. ‘It was a real opportunity to bring back my research to genetic diseases, he says. The institute was on the site of Necker, a famous and unique place in the world of pediatric diseases, and it brings together specialists from various organs - kidney, bones, brain… - all working on genetic diseases. The critical mass of scientists dedicated to rare genetic diseases was very appealing”.\n\nApart from using Drosophila as a tool for the functional validation of candidate genes, he also collaborated with Prof. Corinne Antignac, a physician and researcher specialized in rare kidney diseases at Imagine institute. He got involved in diagnostic activities and identified many patients with a mutation in a gene called cubilin (or CUBN) leading to loss of proteins into the urine or “proteinuria”. Proteinuria is usually associated with a bad prognosis for the kidney. However, in this particular case the proteinuria does not lead to any renal pathology or dysfunction, which is a real surprise. Moreover, by population-based studies they found that CUBN variants associated with a potentially improved renal function in cohorts of patients with chronic kidney disease. Therefore, Simons suggested that inhibition of cubilin-mediated protein uptake in the proximal tubules of the nephron could be a renoprotective strategy."
