        "text": "For the sweet potato puree\n\nBake sweet potatoes by wrapping them in baking sheet and baking them at 200 ° C for as long as needed (about 1 hour).\n\nPierce them with a fork to see if they are cooked, then peel them, mush them up and keep them warm.\n\nBoil the milk and cream along with the leaves of sage over low heat, remove the leaves and add the sweet potatoes. Then season well, taste it and correct the seasoning.\n\nMix and after you remove it from the fire, add the butter.\n\nFor the Roast Beef\n\nBand the fillet with a string or ask the butcher to do it.\n\nGrind in the multi the dried mushrooms, peppercorns, herbs and some salt. Preheat the oven to 200 ° C and in a hot saucepan sauté the fillet on a very high heat.\n\nWhen it gets a nice color from all sides put it on a roasting grill and below it put a baking pan.\n\nBrush the fillet with butter and spread the mushroom-herb mixture evenly.\n\nBake the fillet in the lower shelf of the oven for about 50 minutes at 200 ° C, for a medium baking. If you want your fillet well done, continue for about 15 minutes. For rare, cook it for only 35 minutes.\n\nOnce you remove the fillet from the oven, wrap it well with foil, leaving it to rest for at least 40 minutes before serving.\n\nFor the gravy sauce\n\nSoak the mushrooms in the stock for as long as possible.\n\nIn a thick bottom pot, place the butter and once it is melted, add the flour, by stirring continuously until it gets an amber color, then lower the heat to the minimum.\n\nAdd the broth after removing the mushrooms and all other ingredients.\n\nStir continuously until the sauce thickens, taste it and, if necessary, add more salt.\n\nServe the sliced roast beef, with sweet potato puree and gravy on top.\n\nEva Monochari"
