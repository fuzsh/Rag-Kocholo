Here are some tips.\n\nDust and sweep: Wipe bathroom surfaces with a damp rag including the back of the toilet and sink areas. Sweep the floor, then wipe with cloth and disinfectant cleaner.\n\nToilet: Apply the toilet bowl cleaner and let it sit for a few minutes while doing other tasks. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the outside of the toilet bowl, seat, lid, and top with disinfectant cleaner. With a toilet brush, scrub the inside of the bowl and flush.\n\nShower: If you ignore cleaning the shower, you’ll only have to scrub harder in the future. Apply disinfectant cleaner, let it sit for about 15 minutes, and then clean with a scrub pad and rinse. Once a month, remove the shower curtain and wash in the washing machine. Hang while wet—do not dry in dryer.\n\nSink and counter: Apply disinfectant cleaner on fixtures and counters, wipe with damp cloth.\n\nMirror: Spray glass cleaner on the mirror, wipe away with a rag or paper towel.\n\nIn general, the more often you clean, the quicker it will be each time. Letting dirt build up creates an environment where germs and bacteria thrive, so put on some gloves and keep it clean! We recommend doing this once a week.\n\nBring these helpful cleaning products\n\nRubber gloves\n\nDisinfectant cleaner\n\nGlass cleaner\n\nToilet bowl cleaner and brush\n\nRags or soft cloth\n\nScrub pads\n\nSponge\n\nBucket\n\nBroom\n\nScrewdrivers and brushes are available to disassemble and clean the drain, ask your custodial coordinator.\n\nIf something in the bathroom is broken, fill out a fix-it request on your My Housing account.\n\nYasui Hall\n\nResidents living in Yasui Hall (formerly known as the New Apartment-Style Residence Hall) have a few notable differences when it comes to What to Bring and What Not to Bring, including a larger full size mattress and additional approved kitchen appliances. Please review the New Apartment-Style Residence Hall Addendum in the Residence Halls Standards and Expectations section of the My Housing resources page for more information."
