        "text": "A very close trip from Medellin, Don Matias is about an hour and 20 minutes from Bello just outside of Medellin where our tour offices are located. Giradote is only about 30 minutes away. This trip is a little different compared to others. This is an excellent trip for families who want to get out of Medellin and relax by a beautiful waterfall and eat lunch on a river of sandy beaches. Yes, the surrounding area has river beaches, and they are sandy like an actual beach. For lunch, you will have A traditional Colombian dish called Sancocho and will be made on site while you sunbathe, take photos, or play in the water. There are also two other waterfalls on this trip. The first waterfall you will take a very short hike to, you can swim in, but you need to be a very good swimmer. Here, you can also take photos and relax a bit before you move on to your VIP waterfall for lunch. The final waterfall is an easy trail and easy walk to the waterfall, but can be a little more difficult on the way back as much of it is uphill. The waterfall doesn’t have an abundance of water, but it is a beautiful natural place."
