        "meta_description": "3rd Avenue is an electronic music imprint which operates under the Sound Avenue umbrella. As the Belgian imprint continued to grow and diversify its output 3rd Avenue was created to focus on the more traditional progressive house sounds which ultimately spawned Sound Avenue’s beginnings. The labels initial releases from Blusoul, Lautaro Varela, Matias Chilano and Progress Inn forged a strong blueprint which still holds true today. Now six years since the labels inception 3rd Avenue has built a healthy artist roster which includes Nicolas Rada, Hot Tuneik, Eric Lune, Paul Angelo & Don Argento, Mir Omar, Namatjira and Michael & Levan and Stiven Rivic. The label’s ‘We Are The Future’ compilation series has long been one of the best showcases of new and undiscovered artists. Released quarterly these exclusive collections are now revered industry wide for not only developing new talent but for featuring some of the freshest most cutting edge music around. 2020 holds even more promise for this flourishing imprint with a bevy of exciting releases and an ever expanding artist roster.",
