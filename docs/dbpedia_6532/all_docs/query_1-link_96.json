        "text": "nah, an A&R is:\n\nWhat does A&R stand for?\n\nArtist & Repertoire. The term was coined to describe the function of people at record labels who are in charge of finding and developing new talent.\n\nDevelopment typically includes finding the right material for the artist to perform if they don't write their own songs, hooking them up with the right producer, engineer, studio, etc., deciding which of their songs are the most viable, and shepherding the making of the record.\n\nAfter the record is done, it's not unusual for the A&R person to be responsible for getting the other departments such as retail sales and radio promotion excited about the record so that they do their jobs well. If all the parts of the record company \"machine\" work well together, the act just might have a hit.\n\nToday, A&R people seem to concentrate less on developing artists, and often look for artists that have \"developed\" themselves. It's not unusual for the boards of directors to look more at the bottom line and less at talent development. Hence, A&R people are under pressure to find hits, rather than finding potential hits and nurturing them until they bear fruit."
