        "text": "Yosilin Mendoza has a plan. A few years after immigrating from the Todos Santos region of Guatemala, the 23-year-old Oakland resident wants to become a nurse at one of the region’s top hospitals, preferably working with patients inside emergency rooms on the toughest cases. And while she has a passion for helping everyone who is sick, she wants to help Mam speakers the most.\n\nMendoza is part of a three-person cohort that recently graduated from a local educational program as the country’s first certified Mam health care interpreters. Mam is a Mayan language indigenous to Guatemala whose speakers number, by some estimates, in the tens of thousands in Oakland.\n\nMendoza has seen her family members’ helplessness in health care situations and noticed their deep emotional reactions and gratitude when she began learning English to translate for them.\n\n“My mom struggles with basic language tasks. She understands Spanish but it’s not great,” Mendoza said. “The other day, she had an accident with her hand, and [I was able to describe] what was happening.”\n\nImmigrants are familiar with the compounding pain of showing up sick or hurt at an American hospital without knowing how to communicate what’s wrong in English. The situation can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses and a slowdown of care in an environment where quick decisions must be made.\n\nIn Oakland, where over 125 different languages and dialects are spoken, providers have tried to improve conditions by hiring interpreters. But as populations from different countries arrive, interpreter needs also change. Mam Guatemalans first began showing up in Oakland in significant numbers in the 1980s, refugees from a civil war in which they were being openly massacred by U.S.-trained Guatemalan soldiers. Recently, the demand for Mam-language interpreters has grown as more and more Guatemalans have fled the ongoing humanitarian crisis in their home country. Doctors from Oakland’s Children’s Hospital have worked with the school district and educators from City College of San Francisco to find a solution: creating a certificate program to fast-track new Mam interpreters. The program seeks to help doctors provide better care and give low-income Mam-speaking residents a faster path to a new career.\n\n“Sometimes we [in the health care industry] communicate with Mam speakers through Spanish, but that is often their second language. That’s not equitable and not what our families deserve,” said Dr. Emily Frank, the UCSF Children’s Hospital pediatrician who manages the partnership.\n\nIndeed, students who received Mam interpretation certificates last year told The Oaklandside they didn’t speak Spanish until coming to Oakland, learning it alongside English at public schools.\n\nThe pilot partnership is funded by UCSF’s Center for Science, Education, and Outreach (CSEO), a Pediatric Department Diversity and Inclusion grant, and a grant from the Haas Foundation to Oakland United School District, whose staff identifies students on a health care career track who might be interested in taking the interpreter course.\n\nFrank said that the need for Mam interpretation in Oakland is acute. Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland gets more than 1,000 requests a year for in-person interpretation, with a quarter going unfilled because of a lack of adequate personnel. Frank said hospitals contract with tele-interpretation companies such as Language Line Solutions, but they’re also often not staffed with Mam speakers.\n\nAlameda Health System’s acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and health and wellness centers received twice as many Mam requests with 1,996, according to a spokesperson.\n\nMendoza said one of the benefits of having Mam interpreters in local hospitals is that it encourages Mam-speaking residents of all ages to seek professional health care. Many avoid the doctor because they can’t talk to anyone. She had the same access problem when she arrived in Oakland, going to La Clinica de La Raza in East Oakland or UCSF’s clinic on Telegraph Avenue, both with limited Mam help. The Native American Health Center in Fruitvale offers Mam translation but only for pregnant women, new moms, and children up to five years old.\n\n“Thank God I didn’t have any serious health issues,” Mendoza said.\n\nEnter CCSF’s Healthcare Interpreting certification program. The 17-unit multiple-class course involves classwork and on-site education at a health care facility. Students learn medical terms and standards of practice; they learn how to communicate properly between patients and doctors, nurses, and administrators.\n\nCCSF added Mam to its list of certificate options this year, joining Spanish, Cantonese, Japanese, Arabic, Vietnamese, and others. After several tests and applications to get in, three women from Oakland, including Mendoza, went through what Frank called a “rigorous” full-year educational and training program. It included a summer internship, health care mentorship, and an externship at San Francisco’s and Oakland’s Benioff hospitals, where they shadowed doctors and other personnel.\n\nHow the program developed\n\nAbout two years ago, Frank, a pediatrician who is also a high school teacher, noted that the language gulf between doctors and their patients was growing. Even though she speaks fluent Spanish as a second language, Frank realized there was still a gap in accuracy between what patients were describing as their symptoms and what was happening to them.\n\nShe reached out to UCSF Children’s Hospital’s interpreter services office and started working on a program that could develop Mam interpreters.\n\n“Our best resources to fix this were in our communities. We are lucky to have trilingual individuals living here,” Frank said.\n\nHilda Diaz, the manager of the hospital’s interpretation services in Oakland, and Rosa Arce and Ruby Quesada, the managers at the Benioff Hospital in San Francisco, met with Frank, and together they shaped the contours of what a five-week summer internship and an additional externship could look like. For example, the students would have to learn how to work in inpatient and outpatient services as well as how to work in an emergency room.\n\nThey also looked at financially sponsoring students. Eventually, the budget for the program came to about $6,000 per interpreter, which included stipends for tuition, food, and transportation.\n\nThen UCSF Children’s Hospital had to work with an educational partner. Gayle Tang, a registered nurse and the pioneering founder of the health care interpretation program at CCSF, was the best option available in the Bay Area.\n\nTang created the certification program in 1997 because, she told The Oaklandside, she noticed how medical providers’ communication with non-English patients was poor and led to delayed care. Some feared even going to the doctor because they were embarrassed.\n\n“The business case I made to City College was around patient safety, quality of care, and costs. If a patient goes into a health care facility and doesn’t get the right kind of services, organizations end up spending more money than they need to,” Tang said. She gave credit to her then-employer, Kaiser Permanente, for providing her with seed money to build the program.\n\nEach interpreter cohort program is customized for each language and incorporates veteran health care interpreters who specifically know the subtleties of each culture. The Mam language brings special challenges. It is an internally diverse language, with several different dialects. Moreover, it is not easily converted to ways of life that are totally outside its indigenous context. (An example offered by Berkeley’s Tessa Scott, who has studied Mam language revitalization, is the language around cardinal directions. “Instead of being centered on the poles of the earth,” she said, “the words in Mam are centered around a mountain located nearby the speaker.”) For the new Mam course at CCSF, she said students needed nuanced training around health care concepts because many English words do not exist in Mam.\n\nThe usual structure of the course centers on lectures provided in English. This is where students learn medical terminology around diseases and diagnostics. Students also attend a language-lab course specific to their language concentration.\n\nTang said that the on-site hospital experience gained by the students through the UCSF Children’s Hospital partnership allowed them to fast-track their learning.\n\n“They get familiar with how a hospital works and how patients are taken care of. That’s the kind of knowledge that needs to be [a permanent part] of the program. Because students without in-person health care experience will have a harder time learning the human body,” Tang said.\n\nFrank said she next wants UCSF Children’s Hospital and CCSF to work on a partnership to offer other new languages, including Yemeni Arabic.\n\nBeyond interpretation\n\nLike Mendoza, Flora Cruz Ramos, a fellow interpreter program graduate, immigrated to Oakland from Todos Santos. She came by herself after her parents encouraged her to leave to further her education. She said schools back home failed to offer pathways to professional careers. Working at a pharmacy, she saw the relief that medicine and care would bring to sick folks, and she’s wanted to work in health care ever since.\n\nCruz Ramos credits Oakland public schools, especially Roots International Academy, for welcoming her when she didn’t know how to speak English or Spanish. Roots closed as part of an OUSD budget shortfall decision in 2019.\n\n“I was never discriminated against there and it allowed me to grow my language skills [naturally],” she said.\n\nThe CCSF interpreter program made her to want to do more in health care. Cruz Ramos found the curriculum a little limiting and wished it would have pushed students into even more difficult terminology. But now she wants to become a nurse to provide more specific services. She’s currently studying at Merritt College to do just that.\n\nAt the moment, Cruz Ramos is also looking to get a full-time job as an interpreter and is working part-time as an office assistant. The heavy work and time management needed to get all of her tasks done don’t bother her.\n\n“If I can help the community,” she said, “I will do it.”\n\nAndrea Martin, who received a CCSF coaching certificate while also coaching the cohort,, has lived in Oakland since she was 13, having also arrived from Todos Santos. Working the front desk at La Clinica de la Raza, she became a sort of unofficial translator. Because of her experience already translating medical terms, she served as Gayle Tang’s language expert and on-site coach for other Mam speakers in last year’s class while also working to gain certification herself. The CCSF program offers native speakers the ability to gain an additional credential as a coach once they graduate from the main program. This keeps native language speakers involved, Tang told The Oaklandside, and helps recruit new interpreters.\n\nMartin, who loves working with kids at her job in the local YMCA Head Start program, said the coaching certificate has made her even more confident about working with and translating Mam-speaking family’s special needs.\n\n“When I tell them I speak Mam and English, they’re happy and feel confident,” the 33-year-old said.\n\nIt was harder for Mam speakers to get help 20 years ago in Oakland. It was a struggle to get vaccinated, receive dental exams, or even enroll in school.\n\n“I could not communicate with other people. I learned both English and Spanish at the same time, and it took me a long time to become fluent,” Martin said. Eventually, she was able to get a bachelor’s degree from UC Irvine, and now she wants to get a master’s in social work or nursing.\n\nLearning how languages can provide access to new opportunities has also given Martin the idea that a larger organization is needed to help her Mam-speaking community in other aspects of their lives. She wants to start a nonprofit that provides a full range of key services, including advice for housing and health care. She called Gayle Tang a major inspiration.\n\n“Her story is impactful,” Martin said. “She was young, saw there was a need in the community, and worked to make a difference. I can begin that work, too.”"
