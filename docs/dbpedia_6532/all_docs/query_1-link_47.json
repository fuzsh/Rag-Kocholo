        "text": "After a busy start to the summer, the fast-paced Juventus summer has slowed down a little bit. That is, in part, because Juve’s first handful of summer signings have officially put pen to paper on their new deals and been announced with fancy graphics, but also because you feel like there needs to be some departures to happen to provide a little bit of cash.\n\nThat might mean a move or two that we don’t want to see happen.\n\nThat certainly is the case when it comes to Matias Soulé, who is being linked with a move to Premier League side Leicester City or even Roma (if they can find the money to do it). After getting his first regular playing time of his career in Serie A last season and impressive while on loan at Frosinone, the young Argentine returns with a lot of potential expectations.\n\nIf he stays, of course.\n\nBut, as of now, his future is far from certain in Turin — and that’s true for a lot of players, too.\n\nOn this week’s episode of The Old Lady Speaks Podcast, we discuss:\n\nJuventus are in talks over potentially selling Matias Soulé. So what gives?\n\nWould Juve selling Soulé be a little easier to absorb if it means further transfer targets can be secured because of the injection of funds?\n\nKhéphren Thuram’s move to Juventus is now official. How does he fit into this Juve squad?\n\nThe Thiago Motta era officially got underway last week with the start of preseason training and we have a few thoughts to share about the small clips we’ve seen.\n\nTwitter questions — including just how many players might actually be up for sale, if Federico Chiesa deserves one more chance to make it work at Juventus, if Federico Gatti has become somewhat of a forgotten man the last few months, and how might Kenan Yildiz and Fabio Miretti fit into Thiago Motta’s system next season.\n\nYou can listen to Episode 239 of the Old Lady Speaks Podcast on your preferred podcasting platform or through the media player below:\n\nTo our dear listeners: During these summer months, please look for the latest episode of The Old Lady Speaks Podcast to drop every Monday morning/afternoon for those of you who live in the United States. (Please adjust your time zone according if you live outside of the U.S.)"
