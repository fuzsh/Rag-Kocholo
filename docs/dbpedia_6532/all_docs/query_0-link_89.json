This not so subtle tactic is just a small sign of how easy it is to perpetuate a dehumanized view of your staff as \"resources\" framed in a setting of delivering results at any cost. I love how Susan David highlights that these organizations \"fail to recognize that employee wellbeing is integral to overall organizational success.\" To keep organizations healthy, thriving and creative, skills such as emotional regulation, authenticity and compassion are ones that should be utilized regularly; without them, we are impeding the overall success of the organization. What I have learned over my years in coaching is that the power of helping my staff, students or clients to be aware of and strengthen these \"human skills\" has led to positive impacts in their relationships at work and in life. Leaders, let's keep encouraging this skill and modeling the same."
