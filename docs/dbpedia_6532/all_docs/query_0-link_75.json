        "text": "This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).\n\nMatias Téllez (artist name Matias Tellez) is a Norwegian songwriter, producer, musician, artist and sound engineer.\n\nMatias' parents, both from Chile, moved to Norway as political refugees, and his style is influenced by South American sounds, bossa nova, tropicália and artists such as Os Mutantes, Los Gatos, Jorge Ben Jor, and Caetano Veloso. His music contains elements of pop, rock and tropicália. He is one of the many artists that the press have called the Bergen Wave.\n\nMatias started playing violin at the age of six and piano aged seven, but found what would become his preferred instrument when he picked up his father's guitar at twelve. At the age of thirteen Matias entered the Eggstock battle of the bands with his band, Frustration to Creation, where he placed second, winning the opportunity to record a demo at Tinitus Studios in Bergen. The demo was heard by HP Gundersen and Kato Ådland, who had discovered Bergen artists such as Sondre Lerche, Nathalie Nordnes and Real Ones; they worked with Matias over the following years. Tellez released his first single \"Singing La La La La La\" at age 14 and released his first full album Tamias Mellez in 2007. He released music under his own name until starting the band Young Dreams, for which he is a principal songwriter and producer.\n\nTéllez previously ran Skogen Studio in the Bergen Kjøtt building.[1] Currently runs Blanca Studio[2] and Blanca Records,[3] and is part of LEKK Music[4] and Furō.[5] He was awarded the Spellemannprisen 2020 (producer of the year) for his work with Girl in Red, Sondre Lerche, Kakkmaddafakka and others. He was nominated for the same prize again for the years 2021 and 2022.[6]\n\nWorks with AURORA[]\n\nSongs co-written and produced by Matias[]\n\n\"A Little Place Called the Moon\"\n\n\"Echo Of My Shadow\"\n\n\"To Be Alright\"\n\n\"Earthly Delights\"\n\n\"Invisible Wounds\"\n\nReferences[]"
