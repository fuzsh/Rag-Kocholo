        "text": "A Rose Without Thorns? Please, nobody let Bret Michaels know.\n\nUnbelievable news: A rose has been grown without any thorns. American scientists say the breakthrough could lead to new products in supermarkets.\n\nAre Scientists Trying To Protect Us?\n\nRed roses first appeared in Greek Mythology when Aphrodite pricked her foot on a thorn, spilling blood on a white rose. And tell me, what poet has not used the thorn at once or another?\n\nThorns Have Been In Our Sides For Ages\n\nIt’s more than roses that have caused us pain for all these years. Many plants have dangerous spikes, technically known as prickles. Prickles have evolved independently in species across the plant kingdom, and their main function is to ward off Plant-eating animals and bugs.\n\nHow Did Scientists Fix The Problem?\n\nThe research team, whose findings were published in the Journal of Science, wondered if related genes are responsible for prickles on multiple plants over millions of years.\n\nThe team worked with the New York Botanical Garden to examine specimens with and without prickles.\n\nResearchers at Cornell University used genome editing to eliminate prickles, which takes all the fun out of giving flowers to that special someone.\n\nWhat Is Going To Happen When Bret Michaels Finds Out?\n\nReleased in 1988 a beautiful power ballad by Bret Michaels of Poison, “Every Rose Has It’s Thorn.”\n\nIt was released in October 1988 as the third single from Poison’s second album, Open Up and Say… Ahh! The band’s signature song, it is also their only number-one hit in the US, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks on December 24, 1988.\n\nIn an interview with VH1’s Behind the Music, Bret Michaels said the inspiration for the song came from a night when he was in a laundromat in Dallas waiting for his clothes to dry and called his girlfriend on a pay phone. Michaels said he heard a male voice in the background and was devastated; he said he went into the laundromat and wrote “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” as a result.\n\nEditor’s Note: At press time, Bret Michales did not return our calls for comment.\n\n8 Stunning Colors That Are Actually Song Titles\n\nBorn in Mt Clemens, Screamin’ Scott has been a part of the Detroit airwaves for 30-plus years. With 40 years of experience in radio. When he’s not out on the streets for WCSX, you can find him devoting time to local charities with his, “Screamin Angels”; and for 16 years with Rock 4 Tots charity. And last 10 years with his local band, \"Chit!.\" Screamin Scott likes to write about nostalgic Detroit area memories, classic rock, and local metro Detroit topics."
