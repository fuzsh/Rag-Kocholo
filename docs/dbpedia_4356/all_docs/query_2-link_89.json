        "text": "This is my confession that I thought Monster was good and well made even if it felt lazy, I understood why it was massive while watching and Niecy’s Emmy was deserved.\n\nIt was engrossing and inclusion of Nash character as audience POV and someone to root for was a stroke of genius. I know how much I identified with her. IMO, it was easier to watch his crimes when I knew that Nash was suspicious of him from the get go, was actively trying to prove he was up to no good and would eventually be his downfall.\n\nmurphy’s obvious awardbait bios still get Emmy noms. I kinda don’t see that happening for a Kim Kardashian “sexy procedural,” regardless of the other names attached.\n\nOn paper, they aren’t too keen on nominating crossovers from the first, second try (by crossovers I mean reality stadom-to-acting, singing-to-acting) but it really depends on the role and performance.\n\n\"The spice must sweep.\" - Paul Mua'Sweep\n\n#DUNCSweep2025\n\nOn paper, they aren’t too keen on nominating crossovers from the first, second try (by crossovers I mean reality stadom-to-acting, singing-to-acting) but it really depends on the role and performance.\n\nOn paper, they aren’t too keen on nominating crossovers from the first, second try (by crossovers I mean reality stadom-to-acting, singing-to-acting) but it really depends on the role and performance.\n\nI think they’re probably most open to comedians (Wong being the most recent example)\n\nI might be blanking but I actually can’t think of a single actress who has crossed over from reality and gotten awards contention.\n\nSingers happen, but generally infrequently and the Emmys are usually the most resistant (not including people who did something like Dancing With The Stars when they were already actors), both Selena and Mandy Moore happened on their third try.\n\nI would be interested to see if some of the people doing talk show hosting can transition back (i.e Drew Barrymore).\n\nPeople from modelling backgrounds haven’t had great luck historically but they’ve been significantly more open (HoYeon and Camila Morrone notably) to this recently (and vice versa, I think I’ve seen more actors involve themselves in (as oppose to just attend) fashion shows in the last 5-6 years than I have ever. It has taken Caitriona Balfe a long time to get an industry nom.\n\nI might be blanking but I actually can’t think of a single actress who has crossed over from reality and gotten awards contention.\n\nExcluding talent competitions (Jenifer Hudson on Idol, Ariana DeBose on SYTYCD etc) where the reality stigma obviously still here but the transferable skill set is enough to overcome it, Laverne Cox (4x Emmy acting nominee) is the only one I can recall whom was in personality based reality tv and transitioned into acting. She only appeared on two one season wonders on VH1 from 2010-2012 (as a contest on “I Wanna Work for Diddy” and host of “Transform Me”) but was already a semi prominent actor as well with a dozen or so credits on short films and network procedurals and Orange was such a cultural saturating moment I’m sure 90% of the people who saw it had no recollection of Cox’s prior reality work.\n\nI think overall it’s just hard to judge how the industry takes to any instances of reality personalities making the transition to the full time acting careers because it just doesn’t happen that often. Again, excluding competition shows with transferable skill sets, or America’s Next Top Model (Yaya DeCosta, Annaleigh Tipton, Isis King), which as yourself already brought up, the Hollywood entertainment industry has always been far more responsive to models-turned-actors, the only actual personality based reality star to successful transition into a stable acting career (unless I’m missing someone) is Jamie Chung, a former Real World cast member and winner of The Challenge."
