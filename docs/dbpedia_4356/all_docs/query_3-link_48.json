Television and movies use descriptive video when they employ a Secondary Audio Program (SAP), when the images and actions on screen are described during natural pauses in the dialogue.\n\nIn addition to descriptive video, audio description includes live performances where a narrator describes the actions on stage, as well as tour guides who are trained to describe visual elements.\n\nThe Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) requires that ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC television affiliates in the top sixty markets of the United States provide fifty hours of described prime time and/or children’s programming per quarter. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission began the process of changing that requirement to approximately eighty-two hours of descriptive primetime and/or children’s programming per quarter. Descriptive video for cable television, movie theaters, DVDs, and streaming video services is also becoming widely available.\n\nThis guide provides sources of descriptive video for television, film, DVDs, and web-streaming services, as well as information on audio-described live performances and tours. The guide includes information about the CVAA, the technology and training behind descriptive video, and vendors who provide descriptive services on demand. The contact information for each organization mentioned in the guide and a bibliography for further reading can be found at the end of the document.\n\nContents\n\nSources of Descriptive Video\n\nBroadcast and Cable Television\n\nFeature Films\n\nHome Video\n\nStreaming and Web-Based Video\n\nFurther Reading on Audio Description\n\nDescriptive Video Technology, Training, and Vendors\n\nPerforming Arts, Museums, and Tours\n\nTwenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act\n\nBibliography\n\nContact Information\n\nSources of Descriptive Video\n\nBroadcast and Cable Television\n\nABC: Audio Description\n\nABC\n\nhttps://abc.com/audio-description External\n\nCurrent list of ABC programing with audio description.\n\nAccessibility at USA Network\n\nUSA Network\n\nhttps://www.usanetwork.com/general/pages/accessibility External\n\nIncludes information on accessing video description for content on the USA Network and a schedule of descriptive content.
