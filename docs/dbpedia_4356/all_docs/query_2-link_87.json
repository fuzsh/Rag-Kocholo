        "text": "Swifties, the time has come. Taylor Swift has officially released her Speak Now (Taylor's Version) album. The highly-anticipated re-release drew much support from fans after Taylor revealed that she would be dropping the project during a stop on her Eras Tour in Minneapolis this past June. \"Dear John\" was one of the 2010 album's most talked about songs, largely because fans believed the song's lyrics alluded to Taylor's rumored relationship with singer John Mayer.\n\nDon't remember the tea about their brief ship? Here's a recap. Taylor was 19 when she allegedly dated the 32-year-old singer from December 2009 to February 2010. The song's lyrics about a devastating breakup, references to Tay's age, the inclusion of a guitar that sounds similar to the ones John often uses in his music, and the fact that his name was used in the song's title fueled fan theories that the song was inspired by their short-lived relationship.\n\nOn June 24, the Grammy winner asked her fans for \"kindness\" ahead of the album's release. \"I'm 33 years old. I don't care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote,\" she said, \"So what I'm trying to tell you is that I am not putting this album out, so you should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I wrote a song about 14 million years ago.\"\n\nCheck out \"Dear John (Taylor's Version)\" below if you haven’t yet (tbh, it's been on repeat since midnight), and if you’re still not convinced about the message behind the song, keep scrolling for the full lyrics to Taylor’s \"Dear John (Taylor's Version).\"\n\nLyrics provided by Genius.\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nLong were the nights\n\nWhen my days once revolved around you\n\nCounting my footsteps\n\nPrayin' the floor won't fall through again\n\nAnd my mother accused me of losin' my mind\n\nBut I swore I was fine\n\nYou paint me a blue sky\n\nThen go back to turn it to rain\n\nAnd I lived in your chess game\n\nBut you change the rules every day\n\nWonderin' which version of you\n\nI might get on the phone tonight\n\nWell, I stopped pickin' up\n\nAnd this song is to let you know why\n\nTaylor uses the first verse to look back on the heartwarming highs and devastating lows she experienced throughout her relationship. She also talked about how her former lover made her feel good about herself but the confusion she felt by the games they played.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone\n\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?\n\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\n\nI shoulda known\n\nThe chorus reveals the clarity Taylor feels after the split, the questions she has for her ex, and the red flags she ignored just to be with them.\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWell, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame\n\nOr maybe it's you and your sick need\n\nTo give love and take it away\n\nAnd you'll add my name to your long list of traitors\n\nWho don't understand\n\nAnd I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said\n\n\"Run as fast as you can\"\n\nTaylor uses the second verse to discuss possible causes for their doomed relationship. Not only does she call out her ex's habit of giving love and taking it away, but she also wonders if he'll refer to her the same way he does to the lovers of his past. She also expresses remorse for ignoring the red flags people warned her about.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone\n\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?\n\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\n\nDear John, I see it all now, it was wrong\n\nDon't you think nineteen's too young to be played by\n\nYour dark, twisted games when I loved you so?\n\nI shoulda known\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge]\n\nYou are an expert at \"Sorry\" and keepin' lines blurry\n\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\n\nAll the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes\n\n'Cause you burned them out\n\nBut I took your matches before fire could catch me\n\nSo don't look now\n\nI'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town\n\nOh"
