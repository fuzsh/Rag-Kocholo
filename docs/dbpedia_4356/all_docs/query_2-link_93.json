        "text": "If you're thinking about leaving cable behind, a live TV streaming service may be a good option for you. Contract-free pricing, wide channel selections and the ability to watch on multiple devices are all factors that can make these services competitive compared to traditional TV or cable. You can stream sports, premium channels or prime-time TV, and not only do these platforms offer a broader lineup of channels compared with antennas, but they also provide the convenience of watching on your computer or mobile device.\n\nRight now, there are six main services to pick from (we're not including smaller ones): YouTube TV, Hulu Plus Live TV, Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, Fubo and Philo. But what really counts is the variety of channels they offer, right? We've analyzed their primary channel lineups to help you decide which one may fit your needs.\n\nRead more: Best Sports Streaming Service for 2024\n\nThe Big Chart: Top 100 channels compared (updated August 2024)\n\nThe main difference between the services is their channel selection. All of them offer different lineups of channels for various prices.\n\nBelow you'll find a chart that shows the top 100 channels across all six services, but note that not each service has a worthy 100. There are actually seven listed because Sling TV has two different \"base\" tiers, Orange and Blue. And if you're wondering, I chose which \"top\" channels made the cut. Sorry, AXS TV, Discovery Life, GSN and Universal HD.\n\nRemember that Philo now offers a new package for newcomers that costs $28 per month and bundles in AMC Plus. If you're a current customer, you can keep your current plan and still pay $25.\n\nFubo now offers the YES Network at no extra charge for baseball. And Hulu's live TV offering now includes the MLB Network. We'll also note Fubo's big loss of Warner Bros. Discovery channels such as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, HGTV, Food Network, OWN, TLC, Magnolia Network and Cartoon Network may make it less appealing.\n\nBut if you want to get rid of cable, there are numerous live TV streaming choices available. Sling TV's basic packages are $40 in most cities. But costs continue to go up. Fubo's price for its basic plan is $80, which is the same price as DirecTV Stream's base plan. YouTube TV costs $73 per month, and Hulu's live offering is currently $77. Beware that Hulu plus Live TV will go up in price in October, making its basic package the most expensive at $83 per month. Those changes are reflected in the chart below where applicable.\n\nSome more stuff to know about the chart:"
