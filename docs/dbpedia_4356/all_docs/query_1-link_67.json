FROM IMUS TO INDUSTRY: THE BUSINESS OF STEREOTYPES AND DEGRADING IMAGES ---------- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007 House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in room 2123 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Bobby L. Rush (chairman) presiding. Members present: Representatives Schakowsky, Butterfield, Barrow, Markey, Towns, Gonzalez, Hooley, Weiner, Stearns, Fossella, Radanovich, Pitts, Bono, Terry, Myrick, Burgess, and Blackburn. Staff present: Consuela Washington, Christian Fjeld, Valerie Baron, William Carty, and Chad Grant. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOBBY L. RUSH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Rush. The committee will come to order. The Chair recognizes himself for 5 minutes for an opening statement. I want to begin by thanking our witnesses who have come from far and near to be a part of this hearing, and I want to assure everyone present that this hearing is not a head-hunting hearing. This hearing will be a positive hearing. I hope to come away from this hearing on this day with a foundation to move forward in our Nation. This is not the end. This is just the beginning. We have a crisis in our communities throughout this Nation. There is a culture of death that permeates our society. It is the responsibility of this Congress as it is the responsibility of each and every one of you to be a part of the solution as opposed to being part of the problem. So I am looking forward to developing and to engaging in a coalition of concern and compassion and commitment to address the issue of violence, hate, degradation that has reduced too many of our youngsters to automatons, those who don't recognize life, those who don't value life, and those who don't look forward to a future of hope in this life. I have heard too many of our young people looking and expressing a future that ends before they are 25 years old. They don't think that they will live to be 25 years old, indeed some say as early as 22. They don't expect to see 22 years of age. The statistics according to the Department of Justice bear them out. The greatest cause of death for youngsters 18 to 24 years old is homicide in our communities. I am not blaming anybody. We all are part of the problem, and we all must be part of the solution. This hearing is not anti-hip hop. Let me be real clear. I am a fan of hip hop. I have got children who love hip hop. I admire and respect the hip hop artists who have created an art work, an industry, and an environment where they can employ thousands of people who might not have received employment opportunities were it not for them. I respect the first amendment, and I know that great art is always controversial, but we must also take responsibility in our freedom of expression. I want to conclude by saying and stating the obvious, that the pendulum is beginning to swing, and I am convinced that so- called gangster rap and misogyny is on its way out of the hip hop culture. This committee has a profound responsibility, immense jurisdiction, and it is within the purview and the power of this committee and has to be within the purpose of this committee to make sure that we engage in a conversation that deals with this issue that confronts the fabric of this Nation and threatens the fabric of this Nation, its families, its communities, its institution, indeed its foundation. We can do no more or nothing greater than to open up this discussion, remove the biases, the hypocrisies, and the hype. We have got to have an honest discussion. Our future depends on it. I yield now to the ranking member, my friend from Florida, Mr. Stearns, for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CLIFF STEARNS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Mr. Stearns. Good morning. And, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to echo your sincere comments that you speak from the heart. We all have interest in this subject, and I want to thank you for calling this hearing. Looking at the witness list on panel 1, and looking at all these CEOs, we can certainly appreciate how much their hourly rate together would be for their time, so we appreciate you taking your time to come to speak to us this morning. The chairman talked about the violence, the hate, and the degradation that exists, and why it continues to flourish. I think it is worthwhile to discuss this in light of some of the entertainment we see in a very small segment but an important segment, and obviously it is disappointing for Members of Congress to have to have this issue brought before us in terms of decency in our civil society, and to see how it continually profoundly affects our country. But this committee has jurisdiction in this area. We should be looking at this. I had a hearing when I was chairman of this subcommittee dealing with the video game industry and how it impacted our children, and many of you will note at that time that Grand Theft Auto was the subject of that hearing, and in particular a segment of that video game dealing with hot coffee which a portion of that was imported into the Grand Theft Auto to create pornography. And I note that because of our hearing the video game industry seemed to respond to the pressure we provided and the outrage from the public and from this committee. In the wake of hearings I held in the Congress last session the rating board has strengthened its review process and the industry is offering many new tools to parents to help them. Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission has found that the video game industry is policing itself from production to the retail stores. So I commend them for their good work, and I note, Mr. Chairman, that these hearings do provide pressure in themselves. Sometimes we look to perhaps legislate. Perhaps we look sometimes to influence, and perhaps this hearing will bring influence into this vital area. Music and images can be powerful influences on our children's mind, and I think Congress has been down this road many times debating regulation of speech and commerce. Many of us wonder whether it would be appropriate for Congress to issue a legislative solution. I am not sure we are able to do it to this difficult problem. We are a nation founded on the principle, as you mentioned earlier, Mr. Chairman, of freedom of speech, and we are usually united in our efforts to export that core principles to countries and governments that censor their people and their media. So obviously we don't want to ban the liberty and freedom-- the idea of liberty of freedom of speech. We want to be able to have people to express themselves, particularly in oppressive regimes perhaps like China. But, however, there is today a lot of vulgarity in both the entertainment and the video game industry that we are concerned about which has a major influence on our children, and the problem is often a decision of what is package and what is market, but that primarily is determined by what sells, so a lot of what we see in our culture is perhaps something that these companies and other companies are providing because that sells. Whenever it sells quickly it is imitated, and across the industry other people come up with new favorites. I don't necessarily believe there is a conscious decision to determine the content companies will sell before market analysis shows what is popular, and that is perhaps a key question of this hearing. Numerous examples demonstrate that consumers in the United States have certain tastes that the entertainers cater to. Content that does not sell usually disappears. However, there are other forms of entertainment that still survive and sell well. Nursery rhyme books, animated movies, and religious books all have their audiences and are produced precisely because publishers and producers know they will sell. It is rate that a successful business is set up solely to satisfy a market niche without some indication first that the product will sell and will be well received. Business failures are often attributable to poor planning and poor research that never finds its market as big as it hoped. The successful ones are often the businesses that either know their market beforehand or readily adapt to it. So in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I, like yourself, have some serious objections to much of the content that is sold and concerned about the effects it has on our society. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and obviously asking them some pertinent questions on their opinions. Obviously, American consumers can make their own decisions, but they need information first, and perhaps the biggest thing to do is provide transparency for the consumer so that certainly the parents know beforehand the product they are getting. There is obviously another concern this committee has always had, and that is privacy and protection of the individual's privacy. And in many universities they provide broadband Internet for their students. Now a lot of these universities do not set up privacy safeguards so the music can't be stolen. I am happy to say that the University of Florida, that I represent in my district, works actively with the recording industry to stop piracy on their broad band networks so I hope more universities that university's indication and recommendation. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Rush. Thank you very much. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for 5 minutes for opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAN SCHAKOWSKY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILINOIS Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I too want to thank you for your opening statement both in its tone and its substance. I want to focus particularly on the treatment of women in our communities, and the role of corporations and the media and the entertainment industry and consumers in that treatment. Like everyone else, I am sure I want my granddaughters to be brought up in a society that values their worth and teaches them to be confident and empowered members of our community. I want them to grow up free from physical and verbal abuse. Unfortunately, we have not yet created a society in which that is guaranteed. Girls and young women of color in particular are faced with repeated onslaughts of disrespect and bigotry. As we saw so dramatically with Don Imus' remarks even those who accomplish great things are not immune. All of us have a responsibility to work to end racism and sexism and bigotry in all forms. And I am glad that industry representatives, artists, academics, and women's advocates have gathered here today to begin a productive dialog. I believe that all parties at this hearing bear a special responsibility to insure that the culture in which our children and grandchildren grow up is a tolerate one. There are several fundamental questions here. What kind of culture do we want for our children? How do we determine whether certain words and pictures and values are appropriate? What is the Government's role? None of these questions is easy, which is why this discussion is so important, not just here but more importantly in communities and in homes across the Nation. The sexist and racial stereotypes in much of today's media are culturally poisonous. Many of us see its effects in our neighborhoods every day. But the hallmark of an open society is the right to speak and to create art without governmental interference. Like Chairman Rush, I respect the first amendment, and I am wary of interfering in a way that stifles free expression. Censorship of media that we find offensive is a dangerous game. Who decides what music or movies merit fines or restrictions? Why, for instance, does Wal-Mart ban the sale of explicit music with parental advisory warnings and yet continues to sell Grand Theft Auto in which players are encouraged to stomp on and rape women? Government censorship would be equally arbitrary and it is a slippery slope down which I don't want to go. This hearing recognizes the power of entertainment and culture in our lives. I believe art both reflects and influences society. Artists and corporations need to understand that role and take it seriously. I don't believe in censorship, but I also don't believe that corporations should reap financial rewards by promoting intolerance and bigotry. Consumers too need to take responsibility. Consumers, we have seen, can have a major impact, as we saw on the pressure that resulted in the firing of Don Imus, with the growing demand for more positive lyrics and less violent videos. I want my four grandchildren to grow up in a society that treats all of its members with respect but I am equally concerned with protecting their freedom of creativity. This is why I thank the chairman for calling this hearing and giving all stakeholders here the opportunity to start a dialog that can achieve both goals. I don't think that is impossible. I take this issue very seriously, and I look forward to the discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Mr. Rush. I want to thank the gentlelady. The gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Terry, is recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement. Mr. Terry. Thank you, and I will waive. Mr. Rush. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Butterfield, is recognized for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA Mr. Butterfield. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and I thank the ranking member for arranging this hearing today. I understand that you had some difficulty in getting it arranged. You told me a few months ago that you were going to do it, and finally the day has come. And so thank you very much for your work in this area. In reading the material that we received in our offices a couple days ago, I noticed that the title of this hearing is ``From Imus to Industry.'' I am not sure that that is the best title for this hearing. I wish we had had some discussion about that. We probably could have come up with another title that would have been less antagonistic to the industry, but having said that we are here today and hopefully we will have a productive hearing. Mr. Chairman, Americans have forever enjoyed being entertained whether through music, movies or video games. These devices have made their way into the homes of nearly all Americans where music lyrics are mimicked, movie lines are quoted, and video game characters are emulated. Through these various media outlets stereotypes of exaggerated and women are at times degraded, and that is most unfortunate. Are these lyrics and images a sign of the times? Are the producers of these products merely responding to society's status quo or is our increasingly tumultuous society causing these offensive trends in entertainment. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this is a cyclical problem. It raises larger societal issues than what is being addressed with this hearing. Music is playing a larger part than ever in American society. It is without question that the artists who perform these songs with questionable lyrics or suggestive themes pull from the personal experiences that they have had in their lives in order to arrive at their final product. Whether we like it or not, this is the culture that we find ourselves in today. I attended a hip hop summit a few weeks ago at A&T State University in my home State of North Carolina, and just on a few days notice there were thousands of students attending this hip hop summit. Some of those could not even enter the coliseum. And so, Mr. Chairman, I fully believe in the first amendment. Certainly we all do. I have been in the legal profession for many years, many years as a judge, and years before that as a lawyer, and so I for one certainly believe in the first amendment right that we have under our Constitution. And so the chairman is correct, we must uphold the first amendment rights that we have in this country. Our society is nothing without the first amendment. With that said, however, I think the artists, and two of those artists are here today and perhaps more, they are here and they have the knowledge that millions of Americans would idolize them and imitate them and emulate them. And so they have an obligation. Yes, they have an obligation to record music and to make their movies and to make their videos in a responsible fashion. The artists need to know that their positions are power and they have positions of power. If you think Members of Congress have positions of power, I want you to know that the artists have profound positions of power. They are attractive to our youth so their influence should be positive. The artists whose music we are exposed to on a daily basis are driven by powerful record labels and they too have a fiduciary responsibility to their stockholders to produce what sells. That is basic corporate law 101. Corporations are in the business of producing a profit for their stockholders, and none of us want to diminish that. But the record labels have a large responsibility and they have a responsibility to our society that they not sit idly by and allow these lyrics and the music video images from invading impressionable minds. Studies suggest that exposure to media violence increases levels of aggression leading to increased crime in music and movie and video games that promote gang activity and crime and degradation of women have a direct impact on the way impressionable individuals lead their lives. The entertainment industry as a whole, the artists and the actors and the record labels and video game designers and large media conglomerates must work together. I have a daughter who is a hip hop executive, and I have told her on numerous occasions we all have a responsibility and an obligation to society, and so we must all continue to work together to try to solve the problem that we are facing today. But the responsibility does not terminate with the industry. Parents and children and consumers must be vigilant about what they are buying for themselves and their families. The only way to solve this problem of stereotypes and degrading images in the media is to work together. That is the message that I am delivering today. We must all work together and not engage in a confrontation. I am going to yield back, Mr. Chairman. I will submit my remaining statement for the record. Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The gentlelady from Tennessee, Mrs. Blackburn, is recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the hearing. We appreciate this, and want to welcome all of our witnesses who are here from media, entertainment, academia. We appreciate your time. I especially want to give a welcome to Dr. Tracey Denine Sharpley-Whiting. She is from Vanderbilt University and will be with us on one of our panels today. Today's topic, as you are hearing, is extremely sensitive. Many people have strong feelings regarding the lyrical and visual content portrayed in popular music, and these are not altogether positive. As a mother for my children as they were growing up, and I understand and share many of the concerns that you are hearing expressed here today. However, there are equally passionate voices on the other side of the issue that cherish the purity of the creative process and view today's proceedings as an assault on a artist's first amendment rights. So I anticipate that we are going to hear from both sides of this before the day is done, and my hope is that we are going to have a better understanding and probably a bit more nuance perspective as we look at the issue going forward. After all, I cannot and will not begin to read back many of the lyrics written by the two gentlemen that are going to be on the second panel. They are obscene regardless of when they were written and to what audience they were directed. And in my opinion they do not deserve the dignity of this committee's time. It raises a good question though for these individuals. Where and how did society fail you to the point that you would choose to write such filth? I find it very sad. I find it very, very sad that there would be such a societal failing that you would choose to write such filth. Yet, no matter what I think of the lyrical quality, I cannot and will not begin to consider legislative remedies that put on the slippery slope of silencing our Nation's creators. But that does not absolve policymakers, community leaders, and families from taking an active role in combating the pervasive influence that perverse misogynist and racially insensitive pop culture content plays in our society today. We must do our part in explaining to our children that what they see on TV and hear on the radio may not always reflect reality. And the job doesn't stop there. Our friends and partners in the corporate entertainment industry must remain actively involved in the fight to promote artists and entertainer who carry a positive image. One of the things we have to remember is that as corporate executives--and you work with the understanding that choices have consequences. You also understand that your standards reflect the core values for your company. We will be interested in talking about those core values. I do not pretend to fully understand the pressures that the recording industry faces today from epidemic piracy to the transition to the digital platform but I do understand that corporate leaders in the music business are our partners in helping to build a better community. They are rising to the challenge. We will be interested to know what you are doing for charities and with charities and with education on how to properly use entertainment products. I also understand that much of the world forms their perception of America by what they see on the screen and stage and what they hear across the air waves. In this regard, you do hold the world in your hands. My hope is that you are going to handle it very carefully, and remember that with our great Nation perception is many times reality in the eyes of those beholders. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your diligent work. I look forward to visiting with our witnesses as we proceed through the day. I welcome them all, and I yield the balance of my time. Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Barrow, is recognized for the purposes for an opening statement for 5 minutes. Mr. Barrow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and Ranking Member Stearns for calling this hearing. I want to thank you for taking this subject on. There are some problems where the only thing worse than talking about the problem is not talking about the problem, so I commend you for your willingness to take this subject on. I can't think of anything I could add to your statement, Mr. Chairman, to set the stage for this, so in the interest of time, I am going to yield the balance of my time. I want to thank you once again for calling this hearing. Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The gentleman from California, Mr. Radanovich, is recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Radanovich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your efforts and Ranking Member Stearns, and appreciate the fact that you are holding this hearing today. As the parent of a 9- year-old daily interaction with my son, with people he meets, and things he sees and hears are constant influences on his development. Children are particularly impressionable and often do not understand the difference between fact and fiction, the real and surreal. Naturally I want to make sure that my son is not exposed to that which he is either not mature enough to understand or content that is just simply inappropriate for his age. To be honest, some of the content available today whether in music, video games, TV or movies can be downright disgusting, and in my view is inappropriate for any age group. Certainly I don't enjoy it, and I also understand that there are things that I enjoy that other people do not. However, whether I like the content or not, we live in a country where the very foundation of our society rests on the freedom to express ourselves and that is something I hope we all keep in mind during today's discussion. Fortunately, we also live in a time when there is an abundance of tools, technology, and messaging designed to keep the public informed of content and enable parents to control what their children are exposed to. TV shows now have a rating system that is prominently displayed during the show. Also, technology such as V chip are available through cable and satellite companies that allow parents to block certain shows that they may not want their children watching based on the show's rating. At the end of the day, no matter how many tools are available to control content the responsibility ultimately lies with the individual or the parent. I recognize that there is room for almost every interest in the market place, and diversity makes it easy to filter who is exposed to what. One of my favorite public service announcements was created by the Ad Council in conjunction with industry leaders and broadcasting cable satellite as well as other consumer electronics community. The commercial starts with a model who walks into her living room with a Soprano-like character sitting in front of her, and mom says, ``Remember last week when you hit Vinnie on the head with a shovel? Well, it was pretty graphic, too graphic for my kids, so I am going to have to block you.'' The TVboss.org ad is a perfect example of how the system should work with the tools that are provided to parents. All the industries represented here today, and some that aren't, have made great strides and have gone to great lengths to address the concern of inappropriate content. My son loves to play video games. The gaming industry through rating systems and the ability to block certain games from being able to be played on my son's device has made my job as a parent more doable. I know that with a few clicks of a button I can insure only games with an ``E'' for everyone can be played on his machine. Whether it is the ability to block programs, producing edited versions of CDs or the diversity of having channels that you know all content will be acceptable for certain viewers, I commend the industry's foresight and innovation. The only thing I would ask is that as the market evolves, that technologies improve, keep giving parents more tools to make their job easier because I think we can all agree that raising a child in today's world is not an easy task. Mr. Chairman, I thank you and the ranking member for holding what I think will prove to be a productive discussion between industry leaders, artists, lawmakers, and parents on how we can all work to continue to produce and improve the best controls possible that make my life as a parent more manageable. Thank you. Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentleman. I want to just make a point. There is a fine line between the jurisdiction of this subcommittee and the jurisdiction of the subcommittee that Mr. Markey chairs, the Telecommunications Subcommittee. I want to remind Members that this subcommittee's jurisdiction rests with the content and the interstate commerce which includes products, CDs, video games, et cetera. The public airwaves are under the jurisdiction of Mr. Markey's subcommittee, the Telecommunications Subcommittee. Please be mindful of that. Ed is my friend and we don't want to battle over jurisdiction. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Weiner. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ANTHONY D. WEINER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Weiner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I too want to thank you for holding the hearing and the tenor of your opening remarks. There is almost no doubt that we are experiencing a coarsening of discourse in our country, an increase in the amount of violence and sex and degradation that is going on in our public consciousness and our public debate, and in the media that goes along with it. There is no doubt that for whatever reason the music industry is not creating and rewarding acts like Tribe Called Quest, and Grand Newby, and De La Soul, and acts that once upon a time celebrated a different type of conversation in the communities of our country. There is no doubt that Dance Hall is also affected and other parts of music, and there is no doubt that the traditions of Studio One that created the Barrington Levys of the world and the Bob Marleys of the world have given way to the Buju Bantons of the world, the misogyny and homophobia that they communicate. There is no doubt that when you look at the artists that are being celebrated in the market place today, extraordinarily successful artists like 50 Cent, you see the promotion of records like Get Rich or Die Trying in some of the communities most ravaged by handguns, giant posters with the artist holding a handgun in his hand extended outward clearly sending a message and communicating a message that is a violent one. But this is also the extension of a debate we have been having in this country for generations and generations. The names might be different but it is no different than the conversation we had about sex on television and curse words on television. I remember being shocked when I was a young kid and Alan Alda on MASH said ``son of a b * * * *'' during a MASH episode. You would probably not be able to get through a Sopranos episode without hearing a curse word in every other scene. It is no different than the conversations we have had about all forms of communication and conversation. I don't know who is going to solve the problem. I don't know to what degree it represents a problem or the natural outgrowth of a vibrant market place of ideas. I can tell you we aren't. I can tell you Congress isn't. It is good that we are having this hearing to continue the discussion because it is important that we understand. Only when lines are egregiously broken and crossed like they were in the case of Don Imus do we really engage in this conversation. We go long periods of time before we are shocked at the consciousness and start thinking about it again. I can tell you that we, an institution of 435 members of America's elite, most of us white, most of us well-to-do, most of us not exactly the creators of art, we are not going to be solving the problem. It is good for us to have the conversation. Ultimately it is going to most likely begin with the artists and their customers. I would have liked to see the first panel be the artists. I would like to hear a little bit about what are in the thoughts and minds of someone who creates are that is so violent, that is so misogynistic, that is so angry and coarse. I can tell you that most likely, and I take some exception and disagreement with Mr. Butterfield, I think this is ultimately going to be a business decision. I think when Chamillionaire makes a decision on his second record not to use the ``N'' word and not to use curse words to some degree it is a business calculation. To some degree he is saying what, the market place is pretty well occupied with people cursing and yelling and saying nasty things. Chamillionaire, who is clearly a very shrewd businessman, is saying, you know what, I am going to try to occupy a different place and see if there is a market place for people who want to exhale a little bit, let their shoulders slump because there is finally some music that doesn't say these things. He is clearly making a political statement, and this is what artists have done through generations. I can tell you that it is going to be very easy for us to say, well, maybe if Universal didn't promote something or Warner didn't promote something or maybe if Viacom didn't put it in a video on MTV, although I must admit I haven't seen a video on MTV in forever, maybe then we will be able to solve this problem. But, there was an article in today's the Daily Swarm, which is a blog online that talks with the music industry, about Amazon's new service it is going to sell, MP3s. It had a remarkable statistic. It said they are going to have 2 million songs from 180,000 artists represented by 20,000 major and independent labels. So if you think that Mr. Morris or Mr. Bronfman or anyone can say, you know what, I think this is so violent, that is it, you are done, I am taking you off of my label, there are only 19,999 other places for those artists to go. And we all are familiar with the idea that now one of the most important ways to promote your music is not to have a label at all, just go to the clubs with your CD. You get an influential enough DJ to play your music. Before you know it, you don't need a label at all. So it is probably not going to be Congress to solve this coarsening of society problem. It is probably not going to be the suits that represent the labels. I believe ultimately we need to have a conversation that includes the artists and their customers about why these messages are becoming so popular, why it is that it is so much the popular message. When the artist Shinehead, during the explosion of the crack epidemic, put out a record that was almost entirely devoted to the idea that crack was killing their communities. It sold. Maybe that will begin again. Maybe the Shineheads will emerge again. Thank you. Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Burgess, for the purposes for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Burgess. Mr. Chairman, I thank you also for holding this hearing. I agree this is an extremely important discussion that we need to have. The discussion needs to be in the board rooms. It is appropriate to discuss it in Congress, and quite honestly it is a discussion that needs to be had within the family, but I thank you for bringing it to the forefront of this committee. Now the topic of today's hearing, the business of stereotypes and degrading images, affects communities throughout the country. This past weekend back in my district at Fort Worth, TX, I had the honor of hosting an economic development summit in my district. It really didn't take long for the conversation of this committee's hearing to come up. A civic leader in Fort Worth, Mr. Eddie Griffin, who frequently engages me in conversation on a variety of subjects, he is, as he pointed out, a member of the Afrosphere Bloggers Association, we talked about this at some length and about the impacts that the art is having on his community. He sent me an e-mail yesterday knowing that this hearing was going to be happening, and I found his statement to be really very simple and very profound. He said, ``We will use our collective powers to negatively impact the profitability of those companies who cross the line.'' Mr. Chairman, the Constitution wisely limits what we in Congress can do legislatively regarding what we may consider objectionable material in art or media, but consumers, and as a nation of consumers, we hold tremendous power and we can stop buying the degrading music and video games. We all know that if there weren't a profit, if people weren't buying into the line of products then they would no longer be on the shelves in our local stores for purchase. As Mr. Griffin said, we, everyone in this room and everyone watching this hearing on television can collectively use our power of our individual purse to no longer make this a profitable business for anyone including the companies represented in this room. Some of the artists who are here with us today who pen the lyrics are the retailers who sell the depravities that come into our homes disguised as a simple CD or video game. It is really the most powerful recourse that we have. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Griffin also said in his e-mail that there is only so much that we as African Americans or other Americans can take. I personally don't think that we as Americans should take this type of performance art any longer. It is up to us as citizens to put an end to it. Mr. Chairman, it is my hope this hearing will help us do just that. I thank you for your leadership on this essential issue, and I will yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentleman for the brevity of his opening statement, and now recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Towns, for 5 minutes for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Mr. Towns. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank you and Ranking Member Stearns for bringing us together and indicating that we must work together to find the proper balance, and I am a strong supporter of the first amendment. I am glad that these fine witnesses are willing to engage us in a discussion of the negative effects of degrading images and stereotypes in our culture. We all should have taken some responsibility to help combat the negative effects as we respect important freedoms. I believe this hearing will serve as an important function in that regard. I am especially pleased to see the video game industry represented here today as it continues to provide consumers with innovative technology and products. Over the course of my years on this subcommittee, I have come to know the video game industry well. I know publishers like you, Mr. Zelnick, have contributed a great deal to the industry's overall success in building parents trust and the industry's voluntary rating. In fact, this very subcommittee, as the gentleman from Florida indicated earlier, commissioned a report by the Federal Trade Commission on the practices of the industry. In that report released in April of this year the agency applauded a number of measures taken by the industry to increase parental awareness, retail enforcement and advertising best practices, and I salute you for that. The agency found that nearly nine in 10 parents are aware of the rating system that cut the number of minors who could purchase M-rated games nearly in half. These findings support my view that the industry is taking responsibility for the product it makes and gives parents the supportive tools they need to make informed decisions about what games come into their homes. Regarding the media industry as a whole, there has been an explosion of options available to consumers. We have gone from three networks at PBS to hundreds of channels of diverse content. The main complaint these days is that there is too much to choose from rather than not enough. However, among all of the available content options there are definitely things that I don't care for. I am pleased that the industry has created a rating system that offers parents more information so that they can block degrading images from their kids. There should be a far greater effort to teach parents how to use these controls on their televisions. There is surely something for everyone among the hundreds of channels and iPods and satellite radio programs and DVDs so watch what you like, and don't watch what you don't like. That is a pretty simple theory. As far as lyrics and adult content are concerned, it is a cultural conversation, and we need to be careful not to look like we are advocating censorship of artists whose creative expression reflects their lives and experiences. Those things are what shapes our young people's lives that experiences have forced them to think. I am pleased that we have two successful artists here today to tell their stories. Let us make certain that we respect those important freedoms. This is a complicated subject matter, and the most important thing we can do is convene these forums and engage in a serious, civil conversation that heightens everyone's sensitivities to the problem, not the problem of rap music but the problems facing our community each and every day. This is not about legislating or pointing fingers at anyone. It is about a serious thought for dialog, and I thank you all for furthering the national debate in this forum, and it is really about working together to see in terms of what we might be able to do because you admit, and I admit, that there is a problem. On that note, Mr. Chairman, I almost yield back but I am out of time so I can't yield anything back. Mr. Rush. I want to thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Pitts, is recognized for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. PITTS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA Mr. Pitts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will submit my entire statement for the record but I would like to make a few points. First of all, thank you for holding this important hearing, and thank you for your leadership on this issue. It is very much appreciated. A number of the images and actions, profanity, and overall messages promoted by the music and entertainment industries today are deeply disturbing. Violence, devaluation of life, the degradation of women permeate much of the visual and vocal products circulating in our market place. What people see and hear absolutely does affect them, and that is why marketers spend billions of dollars every year on media advertising. They know that people, particularly kids, internalize what they see and hear, especially when they see and hear it over and over. Companies are in business to make a profit. That is clear, but is it only when there is a public outcry, for example, over lead tainted toys, that companies make changes? Or look at cigarette production. It took a long time for cigarette companies to admit that nicotine was addictive despite a plethora of cited evidence because they did not want to admit the health risk associate with their lucrative products. In terms of degradation in music videos and other forms of entertainment sadly profanity and violence do seem to sell well. Tragically when a product promotes violence it does impact individuals' lives and community lives, even our Nation's life. Take Columbine, for example. We know that the young men who took other students' lives listened to very violent music. One of the songs they listened to repeats six times in one song, ``If I had a shotgun, I would blow myself straight to hell.'' If a child listens over and over and over to lyrics of a song the message begins to sink in and becomes part of the perspective through which he or she views life. In addition to violence in general, a deeply disturbing message promoted by certain songs and videos treats women as objects, not people. These images foster an environment that can be permissive in terms of attitudes of domestic violence against women. Domestic violence statistics in our Nation are horrible, and incidents of violence across all sectors and economic levels of society. According to the University of Minnesota's human rights library, ``Domestic violence also contributes to other forms of violence against women. Women who experience violence at home may be more willing to look for and accept an uncertain and potentially risky job abroad placing them in danger of being trafficked.'' In 2004 there was a briefing in Capitol Hill focusing on domestic trafficking and sexual exploitation. The main panelists were not adult experts, but were five young women from various backgrounds who had lived through years of abuse both at home and on the streets from pimps, police officers, foster care, and others. Even after receiving assistance, the girls were afraid to testify against the pimps who had caused such great harm in their lives because the men would only get 6 months in prison. The girls all knew of others who had testified but who had been beaten up afterwards or even killed. Basically, pimps are sex traffickers. Unfortunately, the music messages we are discussing today promote domestic violence and trafficking in humans. Mr. Chairman, I strongly believe that the responsibility for messages promoted in a particular music album, music video, video game or the like lies at all stages of development and production. Artists, managers, producers, sales representatives, upper level management, and CEOs all bear culpability for the messages that are promoted and affect our youth. There are those performers who are taking a stand to help stop promoting negative messages to our youth. I applaud them. I also commend our distinguished witness, Mr. Percy Miller, on his efforts to produce albums with positive message. We need more individuals like these. I look forward to hearing from our distinguished witnesses, and I yield back. Mr. Rush. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey, for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS Mr. Markey. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I commend you for this most welcome inquiry and discussion. Whether it is rap or hip hop or any other musical genre, it is vital that artists can freely express their talent and convey their messages. This is true of any art form, the spectrum of what it is to be human, what the experience may be for a particular person at this time in history, and whatever circumstances they find themselves discovers following an expression in art. This should be celebrated and revered even if such art or messages occasionally make people uncomfortable. What our popular mass media does, however, is to take certain artists' works and essentially put them on steroids. Quite often the art that is marketed and sold reflect the personal experiences of artists, their neighborhoods, and their understanding of the world in which they have grown up. On the other hand, some of the art that is chosen by large commercial companies for marketing back into such neighborhoods has the power to reinforce messages and bestow acceptability upon themes, actions, and words that no parent and no community leader would ever deem to endorse. Such products can be mean and degrading, and repeated over and over again represent an incessant undermining of human dignity. It was brought into focus most recently for me by comments made by former NBA star Isaiah Thomas. In a taped video Isaiah Thomas said that if a white male referred to a white female by a vulgar term it would be highly offensive. If a while male referred to a black female by the same term it would also be highly offensive. But if a black male referred to a black female by the same vulgar term, Isaiah Thomas said it wasn't so bad. That is repugnant because he is such a role model for so many young people in our country. What a hideous double standard he is promoting. This hearing is tapping into something that is long overdue. Like Isaiah Thomas' comments the subjects for this hearing indicate a moral failing. What responsibility do media companies exercise when they select artists and songs and videos to promote and to mass distribute. I remember when BET was launched. It was supposed to be the black sophisticated educational and entertainment channel full of high-minded fare invoking the best of the Harlem renaissance and the great diversity of the community. Instead it became the lowest common denominator of cheap and tawdry music videos and other questionable programming. I was encouraged to see today's article about some of the new programming BET will be putting out. That is wonderful. But, frankly, it has a long way to go to make up for such a long history of previous programming. And I understand that the music industry is prepared to make its rating system more useful to parents by implementing a mechanism whereby parents can block inappropriate songs. This is something that warrants much further exploration and implementation. In short, I hope that today's hearings result in a dramatic reassessment by media companies as to their overall responsibility and as to the criteria they use to select what they choose to promote and to air. I want to again commend Chairman Rush for calling this hearing, and I thank our witnesses for joining us here today. Mr. Rush. The gentlelady from California is recognized for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARY BONO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mrs. Bono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your holding this hearing today on this very important topic. As you know, I have a connection to, and an affinity for, the entertainment industry, but as a mother and as a Member of Congress, I also have concerns about some of the entertainment products that are delivered to our families in the form of games, television shows, movies, and music. As a result, I believe the industry has a responsibility to provide parents with easily identifiable information and access to the best technology available so they as parents can decide what is seen in their households. In many respects, the industry is addressing its responsibility through available technologies and parental notifications. It seems to me though that the true challenge is continuously connecting parents to this information. For that reason, I am pleased that you have convened this hearing. It is important that the subcommittee be a part of the national conversation about whether artistic expression can go too far and what too far is or said another way whether there are additional actions that entertainers and industry should consider in order to insure that they can continue to innovate, freely express themselves, and provide ample notice to consumers, particularly parents about the products being sold. Of course, this debate has been going on for as long as there has been music or even teenagers for that matter. I remember a while back after a controversial appearance by Two Live Crew a conservative Republican senator from Florida made news and turned heads when he said, ``Under our form of freedom of speech words are protected. Once we begin selectively defining which words are acceptable, we enter a slippery slope where freedom is compromised.'' And that senator had it exactly right. Last night when I was reviewing the panel's testimony, I was pleased to see that some of you made similar points. I was also pleased to notice that you all seem to take this issue seriously and that you take your responsibilities just as seriously. Our founders understood that we are healthier as a nation if we don't silence words that offend or provoke but instead use them to encourage the very dialogs and discussions like we are having today. I share this belief and am glad you are all engaged in a dialog with us, with your colleagues throughout the entertainment industry, and most importantly with parents. I would like to thank our panelists for being here today. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. I am just going to take prerogative right now. There are two people in the audience that I really have to recognize. One is my friend, Mr. Dick Gregory. He is in the audience. I want to thank you, Dick, for being a part of this hearing. And another struggling entrepreneur from this city, Mr. Anton Mohammed. Mr. Mohammed, thank you for your participation in this hearing. Now the Chair recognizes the witnesses. Again, I want to thank you for the generous use of your time. You have been very, very patient with us, and we certainly thank you. And the Chair now recognizes Mr. Philippe Dauman. He is the president and CEO of Viacom, Incorporated. As we all know, Viacom is one of the largest media companies in the world and owns MTV network and Black Entertainment network, both of which feature music videos along with original programming. Mr. Dauman, you are recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement. Thank you for your presence. STATEMENT OF PHILIPPE P. DAUMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, VIACOM INTERNATIONAL INC., NEW YORK, NY Mr. Dauman. Thank you, Chairman Rush, and Ranking Member Stearns. My name, as you said, is Philippe Dauman. I am president and CEO of Viacom, home to some of the world's most iconic television entertainment brands including MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Spike, Logo, and BET, as well as Paramount Pictures, which produces and distributes motion pictures across the globe. The success and popularity of these and our other entertainment brands is rooted in the innovative spirit of our organizations. Viacom has two of the most experienced, well-respected leaders in the business running our TV programming divisions, Judy McGrath, chairman and CEO of MTV Networks, and a 20-year veteran of the company, and Debra Lee, who has spent the past two decades at BET Networks, and today serves as chairman and CEO, each a trail blazer in her own right. Judy and Debra oversee diverse executive teams that are the stewards shaping the content of our channels. We understand that with influence comes responsibility and we take our responsibilities seriously. We have a responsibility to entertain. If we fail to fulfill this most basic responsibility we don't have a business. We have a responsibility to speak authentically to our viewers. Our entertainment has to engage the audience. Believe me, this is no simple task. Boomers, generation X, progressives, conservatives, parents, children, and every race and ethnic background, we cover a lot of ground. The fact is that none of these distinct audiences is monolithic. That is why we spend a lot of time, effort, and money researching what our audiences want. A one size fits all approach cannot succeed. That explains why ``Juvies'' a real-life portrayal of the juvenile criminal justice system, aired on MTV along side ``The Hills'' a show about affluent young adults living the good life in LA. While on BET, you will see Sunday Best, a search for the next great gospel singer, as well as Baldwin Hills, a reality series focused on the lives of upper middle class African American high school students. Rather than stifling creativity in pursuit of consensus, we seek balance, a balance of content that entertains and reflects the full spectrum of our diverse audiences' interests but every show is not for every audience. This is why we have standards and practices that govern all of our programming and guide our ratings. Every show and every music video are reviewed by a diverse group of employees before they are seen on a lot of our networks. We play no role in producing or creating videos. That is within the exclusive purview of the artists and record labels. We do, however, take a very proactive role, which is why some videos are edited and some are rejected. Once programming meets our standards it is given a rating. Videos are rated in blocks. Parents and viewers can then rely upon these ratings to make informed decisions and use existing technology to block programming they don't want or simply turn off the TV. That brings me to an equally important responsibility, the responsibility to engage, educate, and empower our viewers. We continually strive to make a positive difference in our lives and in our world. This commitment is part of our DNA, and I am proud to say we do it very well. Some of our most successful efforts include Viacom's worldwide KNOW HIV/AIDS initiative, VH1's Save the Music Foundation, BET's HIV/AIDS Rap It Up campaign, mtvU's fight to raise awareness about the genocide in Darfur, and an exciting new venture Think.MTV, an online site designed to encourage and enable young people to get involved in public service, which launched just last week with the generous support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Finally, we have a responsibility to listen to both fans and critics, and engage in a constructive dialog that will help us fulfill all of these missions. That is why I am here today. And we don't just listen to our audiences and our critics, we provide a platform for their voices to be heard. That is why tonight BET will premiere the first of a three-part news special, Hip Hop vs. America, a wide-ranging, insightful discussion of the impact of hip hop on our culture. For nearly three decades, Viacom has created compelling, entertaining and, yes, sometimes controversial programming. But as you will see in this clip from Hip Hop vs. America, we intend to continue to engage our audiences in a productive dialog and create programming that reflects our dynamic popular culture. [Video clip shown.] [The prepared statement of Mr. Dauman follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Rush. Our next witness is Mr. Edgar Bronfman, Jr., president and CEO of Warner Music Group. Warner Music Group recently separated from Time Warner, Inc., and owns the hip hop label Asylum Records under the independent label group. Mr. Bronfman, thank you for coming. You have 5 minutes for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF EDGAR BRONFMAN, JR., CHAIRMAN AND CEO, WARNER MUSIC GROUP, NEW YORK, NY Mr. Bronfman. Thank you, Chairman Rush, and Ranking Member Stearns, and members of the subcommittee, on behalf of the men and women of Warner Music Group, I want to thank you for inviting me to testify here today. We at Warner recognize that we have a responsibility for the content we distribute and present to the public. Mr. Chairman, we welcome your convening this hearing and we hope it will allow us to engage in a thoughtful approach, a dialog among artists, media companies, community leaders and public officials, that is best able to examine an issue of importance and civic interest. How we grapple with issues of humanity, including race and gender, ultimately comes to define what we, as a nation, stand for and who we, as a people, are. The history of our country is, in one sense, the unfolding story of how we have dealt with these issues. Often, artists who deal with the topics of race and gender in their works are seen as not only casting a spotlight on those issues but sometimes as being part of the problem themselves. Creative works in any medium, not just music, can be controversial. In fact, they are often intentionally controversial in order to shed light on a social problem and to try to bring about much needed change. Protest art, whether music, literature, or the visual media has played a long and distinguished role in the history of our country. But we also recognize that some creative expression is capable of being more than controversial. Some creative expression can be offensive. At the same time, we recognize that sensibilities are individual by their very nature and what may be offensive or inappropriate to some is important and necessary to others. As a result, when evaluating the content we release the balance we have to strike requires us on the one hand to protect and defend an artist's freedom of expression. That is an activity we see as supporting not only our own business but also our Nation's principles. At the same time, we know that we must consider and very carefully consider the impact on our society of the content that we are offering to the public. Striking the appropriate balance among these often conflicting values, interests, and concerns is a complex and ongoing challenge, and it is also a moving target. In the 1950s many people were deeply offended by Elvis Presley, and a decade later many more were scandalized by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. At various points in time, even entire musical genres such as Rock and Roll, Rhythm and Blues and Jazz were branded as the work of the devil. Thankfully, as years have gone by, those perceptions have been altered. Public tastes and distastes wax and wane, which is why it is impossible to apply a uniform standard to any form of creative expression. However, to try and maintain our obligation as a responsible corporate citizen while dealing with these very complex challenges, we have developed and continue to evolve a set of practices to guide us. I would like to give you a brief overview of our practices regarding content. They begin with the creative process itself. The executives at our record labels maintain an ongoing relationship with our artists and their music. Our aim is not to create art or to censor it, but rather to assure that our artists are aware of the potential impact of what they have created. We are very careful to consider any potentially offensive content, including matters of race, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation or physical or mental disability. We also evaluate the societal context, cultural value and artistic merit of the creative work, as well as the reputation, background, personal history, and intent of the artist, as well as how the work relates to, and compares with other works. We label our content as explicit using RIAA guidelines to alert the public, especially parents and guardians of young people to the presence of explicit content. Additionally, we offer edited versions of label product to our retail, broadcast and digital partners, so as to broaden the choices available to consumers. But reviewing our content is not a simple job for many reasons, not the least of which is that there are no absolutes. Every day we grapple with finding the right balance. Different people draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable in different places. What is acceptable when it comes to creative expression is often determined by our age or class, our education or religion, our cultural surroundings, perspective or profession to name but a few of the influences on our individual attitudes, and the line keeps shifting. As I mentioned earlier, it is abundantly clear that what is deeply offensive to some people at a given moment in history can become with the passage of time not only acceptable but in some cases revered. So the message I with to convey to you today is this, we recognize our responsibility with respect to our content. It is one we do not take lightly. Meeting that responsibility requires a delicate balance of many complex and difficult issues, one that only be achieved through a constructive dialog among artists, the industry and the communities we live in and serve. And we are committed to being a strong and thoughtful partner in that dialog. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bronfman follows:] Statement of Edgar Bronfman, Jr. Chairman Rush, Ranking Member Stearns and members of the subcommittee, on behalf of the men and women of Warner Music Group, I want to thank you for inviting me to testify here today. We at Warner Music Group recognize that we have a responsibility for the content we distribute and present to the public. Mr. Chairman, we welcome your convening this hearing and we hope it will allow us to engage in a thoughtful approach--a dialogue among artists, media companies, community leaders and public officials--that is best able to examine an issue of importance and civic interest.

We label our content as ``explicit'' using RIAA guidelines to alert the public--especially, parents and guardians of children and young people--to the presence of explicit content. Additionally, we offer edited versions of labeled product to our retail, broadcast and digital partners, so as to broaden the choices available to consumers. But reviewing our content is not a simple job. For many reasons. Not the least of which is that there are no absolutes. Every day we grapple with finding the right balance. Different people draw the line between ``acceptable'' and ``unacceptable'' in different places. What's ``acceptable'' when it comes to creative expression is often determined by our age or class, our education or religion, our cultural surroundings, perspective or profession to name but a few of the influences on our individual attitudes. And the line keeps shifting. As I mentioned earlier, it is abundantly clear that what is deeply offensive to some people at a given moment in history can become, with the passage of time, not only acceptable but revered. So the message I wish to convey to you today is this: we recognize our responsibility with respect to our content. It is one we do not take lightly. Meeting that responsibility requires a delicate balance of many complex and difficult issues, one that can only be achieved through a constructive dialogue among artists, the industry and the communities we live in and serve. We are committed to being a strong and thoughtful voice in that dialogue. ---------- Mr. Rush. The Chair thanks the gentleman. Now we will recognize the president and CEO of the Universal Music Group, Mr. Doug Morris. The Universal Music Group owns Interscope Records, one of the most prominent, ground breaking hip hop recording labels in the world. And at the conclusion of Mr. Morris' opening statement, we will have to recess because there is a vote on the floor, and we will reconvene--there are four votes on the floor, and we will reconvene immediately at the conclusion of those four votes. I thank you for your patience as we go over to vote upon the conclusion of Mr. Morris' statement. Mr. Morris, you are recognized. Thank you and welcome. STATEMENT OF DOUG MORRIS, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP, NEW YORK, NY Mr. Morris. Thank you, Chairman Rush. Thank you, Congressman Stearns. Thank you, Congressmen and women who are present here today. My name is Doug Morris, and I am chairman and CEO of the Universal Music Group. Thank you for this opportunity to be part of a national dialog on the impact of music in our lives and on our society. I certainly am not a stranger to the subject matter of this hearing. Lyrics and contents of songs are something that I have discussed with artists and media executives a great many times over too many years. I remember talking about it with my own parents and then with my kids as part of the inevitable tug between parents and teenagers. There are problems in our communities, and it would be disingenuous to act as if music and the media have no influence on our culture. The question that my colleagues and I regularly wrestle with is what we should do when an artist chooses to push the envelope. How can we balance the artist's right to express himself or herself with our responsibility to parents, employees, and society at large? These are really important issues, and we thank the chairman for providing such a prominent forum to further this conversation. First some context. My company's music catalogue covers everything from Motown and Mozart to U2, Pavarotti, Reba McEntire, and Common. We distribute titles that range from High School Musical to Cornel West's recent CD about contemporary society. Rap is but a small part of Universal's total release schedule each year. Universal's mission, my mission, is to offer music fans around the world a selection of voices and sounds from as diverse and dynamic a group of artists as possible, knowing full well that not everyone will like or appreciate every artist or every work by every artist. The reason I like working with artists is because they look at the world a little differently than you and I. Their unique perspective pushes us to consider things we might not otherwise even consider. From its inception rap has always been one of the most reflective genres in our culture. Perhaps it is the artist's willingness to hold up for review and scrutiny the more disturbing elements of the human condition. There has been a great deal of discussion about three particularly incendiary words sometimes used in rap, the B, H, and N words. I should point out that the overwhelming majority of the music in the Universal catalogue does not contain those words. Some rappers do use highly charged words, and that of course has led to this debate. From rappers themselves--like Chamillionaire in his new song which is quite funny, it is called the Hip Hop Police-- discussions on Oprah and BET, to op-eds, the words used by some are prompting a very important dialog that will tell us some things about ourselves, our society now, and the future of our society. While I am the chairman of my company, the artists' words are certainly not my words. I have not lived their lives. I did not grow up in their homes or neighborhoods, and I certainly do not wish to control their emotions or their opinions. Much of the music is made by young people, many struggling to find their way. Like many young people their age they are rebellious, angry, filled with testosterone. Unfortunately, many of us grew up to be our parents. Maybe not unfortunately, but that is a fact. Their words reflect this. Often times the words are the most incisive commentaries on the problems plaguing our communities. I don't take credit for the observations and expressions made in the songs that we love, nor for songs that contain lyrics that you and I may find offensive, but I do have a compact with every artist that we sign that I will support their art and I will support their right to express themselves. Importantly, this commitment extends to the public as well. Whether it is parents, fans or critics, if artists choose to use explicitly highly charged words, we will sticker the song with a parental advisory label. We are committed to insuring that music buyers get a heads up when a song contains words or themes that might not be suitable for all audiences. The people at our record labels who reviewed the lyrics come from different walks of life. Their decisions are not made in a vacuum. Context is important. The cultural climate has an impact. There are regular conversations with retail outlets, radio programmers, and TV executives. And if the labels decide to sticker a song, edited versions are typically made available for retail as well as radio and television. If a work contains a parental advisory sticker our record companies follow the RIAA guidelines that limit when and how we market our music. In other words, we do not market explicit lyrics anywhere near young people. We believe we mostly get it right through the sticker process and by making available edited editions, sanitized versions that address the feedback that we get from consumers and our distribution partners. I opened my remarks today by talking about the national discussion taking place about the impact of music in our culture and our responsibilities to the company. I think it is really a healthy one for all concerned. As we debate this issue, I am mindful of an important principle. Mr. Rush. Mr. Morris, you have exceeded your time. Please conclude your comments. We do have to go vote so we have got just a couple more--as a matter of fact, the time is up for us to go vote. We got to run over there before they bang the gavel, so would you please bring your comments to a close, please? Please bring your comments to a close. Mr. Morris. Certainly. I will just finish. I have one last paragraph. We pay a price for the first amendment. The price includes allowing highly charged words and images in our music even if they sometimes offend and cause pain. But consider the alternative. We pay a price but it is insignificant compared to the ability to speak our minds. I thank you today for inviting us. [The prepared statement of Mr. Morris follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Rush. Thank you. The subommittee stands in recess until the conclusion of the last vote. We have got four votes. We will begin again immediately after the conclusion of the fourth vote. [Recess.] Mr. Rush. This subcommittee is called to order again. Let me first of all remind the witnesses that your full written statement will be entered into the record. If you can summarize your statements in a matter of 5 minutes, then that would be good. We have not had a problem so far. I think that we have been very good as it relates to not going over the 5 minutes, and I really respect and acknowledge that. I want to call now to testify before the subcommittee Mr. Alfred C. Liggins III. He is the president and CEO of Radio One. Radio One is a minority-owned radio station and it is the seventh-largest radio broadcaster and largely targets African- Americans with urban-based programming. Welcome, Mr. Liggins, and please take 5 minutes for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF ALFRED C. LIGGINS III, PRESIDENT AND CEO, RADIO ONE, INC., LANHAM, MD Mr. Liggins. Thank you, Chairman Rush and Ranking Member Stearns and members of the subcommittee for allowing me to testify here today. For those of you who I have not met, let me formally introduce myself. I am Alfred Liggins III, chief executive officer of Radio One Incorporated. Radio One Incorporated is currently the largest media company in the United States that primarily targets African-Americans. Our media platform includes radio, print, satellite, Internet and our nationally distributed cable channel, TV One. Our Radio One network currently consists of 60 radio stations and can be found in 19 mostly large cities around the Nation. Three of our stations serve the Detroit market with music and talk formats including the first nationally syndicated black talk network. Five of our stations in Dallas and Houston provide music formats including our innovative contemporary inspirational format, which can now be heard on 12 FM radio stations across the country including Charlotte and Augusta. However, those numbers do not really paint the full picture of who Radio One is. Radio One takes its responsibility to serve its communities very seriously. For this reason, the content broadcast on Radio One stations is a product and reflection of the audiences we serve. We at Radio One pride ourselves on our close-knit relationships with our listening audience, and we and view them as members of our extended family. This causes us to be responsive to and engaged in the many public affairs issues facing the local communities where we broadcast. Just within the last week, two of our popular radio DJs who host shows with a hip hop format, one of whom can be heard in Dallas and Augusta and one of whom can he heard in Detroit, played an instrumental role in bringing national attention to the issues faced by the six black teenagers known as the Jena 6. We are proud to say that the efforts of many of our local radio stations to raise awareness of the Jena 6 case and organize bus caravans helped lead thousands of citizens, I think 50,000 citizens, to journey to Louisiana and played a pivotal role in making the rally for justice in Jena such a resounding success. Also last week in response to the senseless violence that is currently plaguing Philadelphia and causing the city to lead the Nation in homicides, our local station there, Praise 103.9, organized a sold-out gospel concert featuring Yolanda Adams and Les Brown at Sharon Baptist Church, focusing on the theme, black life has value. We broadcast the concert live and also had personalities from our hip hop station in attendance to show their support for this important message. I mention these events because they represent Radio One's commitment to our audience and are important to truly understanding who we are as a company. I applaud the subcommittee and Chairman Rush in particular for tackling this important topic. Throughout the course of our Nation's history, there have been many debates and differing opinions regarding musical content, freedom of speech and what constitutes art. Some have claimed the Bible is too violent, that Mark Twain is too racist, and I am willing to bet 100 years from now we will still be debating these important issues. When it comes to hip hop music, some may choose to focus on particular artists or music that they found objectionable and I believe that that sort of debate is healthy and ultimately good for our society. However, it should be noted that hip hop music is not representative of the bulk of the content that we at Radio One provide. Only a small minority, 14 out of 60 total radio stations, have an urban contemporary format and they play hip hop music which often reflects the realities that many of these audiences face and observe in their daily lives. Radio One is also not in charge of creating content or in the business of censorship or determining what is in good or bad taste. However, while other media platforms do not have public interest obligations, as the members of this subcommittee know and are well aware, we are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Radio One has always taken great care to comply with FCC guidelines and standards in regards to content. In fact, it should be pointed out that of all the music platforms available to listeners today, only broadcast radio is required to take steps to protect our listeners. It is Radio One's policy that no song can be broadcast over the radio until it is listened to and the content is reviewed. Also, every Radio One station has a program director who is directly responsible for the music that is broadcast on that station. Each of our radio stations receive radio edit versions of songs which if necessary are further edited consistent with FCC regulations and local community standards. Our program directors participate in a conference call every other week moderated by our senior vice president of programming to discuss the content of music playing on our radio stations. Part of the success of Radio One is based on the fact that we as a company respond to the variety and diversity of musical tastes of our audiences. If Radio One did not play hip hop music, we would not be serving our audience. Radio in many ways is a reflection of its community and what its listeners want to hear. We pride ourselves on being local broadcasters with the emphasis on ``local.'' It is broadcasters that offer the localism that communities need and deserve. While hip hop music is many different things to many different people, it is important to remember this revolutionary art form has created a multitude of opportunities and economic benefits for those who may not otherwise have had such an opportunity. For example, Snoop Dogg's success has allowed him to create a football league intended to attract inner city youth to football and not gangs, and David Banner has successfully used his star power to raise funds and increase visibility for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, which we participated in. We at Radio One are proud of our track record and are committed to serving the needs of our diverse audience and being responsible broadcasters. Again, I thank you for allowing me to testify before the subcommittee today and I look forward to answering any questions that you might have.

Again, thank you for allowing me to testify before this subcommittee today and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. ---------- Mr. Rush. Thank you very much. Our next and final opening statement will come from Mr. Strauss Zelnick, who is the chairman of the board of Take-Two Interactive Software Incorporated. Take-Two owns Rockstar Games, which makes the popular and controversial Grand Theft Auto video game series, and I might add, other kinds of products also. Mr. Zelnick, welcome and please take 5 minutes for an opening statement. STATEMENT OF STRAUSS ZELNICK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, NEW YORK, NY Mr. Zelnick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Stearns. I have submitted my testimony to the record so if I may, I am going to speak somewhat less formally to the committee. Chairman Rush, in the beginning you talked about forming a coalition of concern, compassion and commitment, and I think from everyone's comments today, I think it suggested we see the world very much as you do. In fact, there is not a lot of diversity of comments here. I am the chairman, as you said, of Take-Two Interactive, one of the world's largest independent publishers of interactive entertainment. Before that, I was the chief executive of a big record company, BMG. Before that I was the president of a big movie studio, 20th Century Fox, and I started my career in television at Columbia Pictures. As Representive Stearns said, our job is to make hits. That is what I have had to do my whole career, and we make hits by paying attention to what our consumers want and delivering them a product that most people like. So in my career, my companies have not only put out products like Grand Theft Auto but my companies have released movies like ``Home Alone'' and been responsible for artists like Whitney Houston. This is a committee that is partially focused on commerce. This is a big business. While the music business has faced some declines of late and the movie business has basically been flat, interactive entertainment has been growing rapidly. Today it is an $18.5 billion industry. It is bigger than the box office in America and around the world and we employ about 250,000 people. My own company, which some people probably have never even heard of, does over $1 billion a year in sales and we employ over 2,000 people around the world. I take this topic really seriously. Like many others here, I have children; I have three kids. My oldest took the subway to school this morning in Brooklyn. I am really concerned about my kids' safety, their opportunities, violence that they see around them and that might affect them, and a culture of civility which seems pretty stressed right now. So I agree that this shouldn't be a discussion about finger pointing. In fact, the evidence and common sense suggests that entertainment doesn't create values and certainly doesn't create behavior. As the interactive entertainment business has grown in the last 17 years, in fact per capita violence in America, as stunning as it still is, is actually down 50 percent in those 17 years. What is also pretty remarkable is all the entertainment we produce is worldwide. It is a worldwide phenomenon but many of the issues that we are discussing today are uniquely American problems. So why are we so special? Well, the first is, sadly, there is ready access to guns in America. Thirty-five percent of American households have firearms. Despite our enormous wealth in this country, there is inadequate educational opportunity. There is domestic abuse, there are drugs, there is gang activity and the list goes on. I am also pleased that today's discussion isn't about the first amendment. Everyone here agrees that the first amendment must be protected. It seems to me that everyone here is proud that we live in a country that guarantees freedom of speech, even speech we don't like. So I think the discussion should be about what are "
