        "text": "Portable Compact HD Switcher\n\nThe V-1HD makes it easy to connect and switch video cameras, smartphones, computers, tablets, Blu-ray players, and other HDMI video sources with a simple push of a button or slide of the T-Fader.\n\n4 HDMI inputs\n\nSupports up to Full HD 1080p\n\nEasy-to-use interface\n\nFull 12-channel audio mixer included\n\nEasy to operate with hardware controls\n\nTwo HDMI outputs\n\nPicture-in-picture and split functions\n\nTwo EFFECTS knobs deliver genuine visual performance\n\nRemote control via USB or MIDI connection\n\nSoftware control using V-1HD RCS Application for Mac, PC, and iPad\n\nSystem Program Version 2.0\n\nSystem Program Version 2.0 is a free update for the popular V-1HD HDMI video switcher including the companion Remote Control Software version 2.0 for Windows & macOS. Version 2.0 expands picture-in-picture effects with a new 1/3 sizing option. Turn on Auto Scan for hands-free switching. Numerous user interface improvements include the ability to view audio level meters on the multi-viewer, panel lock, and quickly reset system values by holding the WIPE button.\n\nDownload Current Version\n\nA Standard That Set the Standard\n\nThe V-1HD has set the standard in 4-channel HDMI video switching. The highly successful V-1HD is used to create webcasts, live performances, sports production, presentations, conferences, house of worship services, and training curriculum. With a variety of HDMI sources, the V-1HD seamlessly mixes cameras, computers, tablets, media players, and game consoles in 1080p HD.\n\nV-1HD Connectivity\n\nThe V-1HD includes all HDMI connectivity to keep workflows economical, simple, and flexible. Nearly all modern cameras and digital video devices use HDMI—the most common A/V connector on the planet. The V-1HD seamlessly mixes four HDMI sources, video cameras, action cameras, PC/Mac, and more with Full HD support, even when the sources are mismatched, interlaced, or progressive.\n\nOn-screen display of the Preview Out.\n\nSimple Interface\n\nThe V-1HD sets a new benchmark in simple-to-use interfaces for setup and control. Connect an HDMI monitor to the multi-viewer preview output. Basic operation requires just a few buttons and the T-Fader, the most recognizable video switcher interface for amateurs and professionals alike. Large broadcast-style back-lit buttons ease video switching in low light conditions. Meanwhile, output fade dials in smooth, fast fades to black or white.\n\nVisual Effects\n\nVideo effects, layers, and graphics add polish and excitement to any production. The V-1HD has a three-layer effects engine, so you can create picture-in-picture composition and split screen function. Plus, combine Chroma/Luminance keying with visual effects like silhouette, colorpass, and negative to keep audiences engaged and entertained.\n\nAudio\n\nThe V-1HD might be small, but its powerful 12-channel digital audio mixer fits effortlessly into any live production environment. Mix embedded audio from all four HDMI channels with a stereo line-level or mic level input. Each audio input channel features delay, EQ, reverb, and mastering effects on all outputs, including both HDMIs and stereo RCA connection. Therefore, the V-1HD replaces many standalone sound processing racks.\n\nMastering function adjusts the sound balance of each frequency band.\n\nAutomated Video Switching\n\nThe V-1HD makes your job easier with two technology-assisted automatic switching modes. Input Scan switches sources in a range of 1–120 seconds in sequence. Beats Per Minute (BPM) Sync is also available, automatically switching Preview and Program at a specified song tempo.\n\nTwo Video Outputs\n\nTwo independent HDMI outputs are available. One output can be assigned to display one of three different video busses, providing the versatility needed for professional production. For example, use one as the main program output for a projector/monitor, recorder, or livestream. The second output may be used to split the main program output, turn any HD video monitor into an “up-next” input preview display, or show a four-way multi-viewer preview screen.\n\nV-1HD Remote Control\n\nThe dedicated V-1HD remote control app turns an iPad into an efficient touch interface. You can also use the PC/Mac Remote Control Software to run essential switching functions, mix audio with virtual faders, change settings and effect parameters quickly, and create up to eight custom scenes for fast, efficient setup changes.\n\nPanel Design\n\nFront\n\nRear\n\nVideo\n\nVideo Processing\n\n4:2:2(Y/Pb/Pr), 8-bit\n\nInput Connectors\n\nHDMI INPUT 1-4: Type A(19pins)x 4 *HDCP Supported\n\nOutput Connectors\n\nHDMI OUTPUT: Type A(19pins) / HDMI PREVIEW: Type A(19pins) *HDCP Supported\n\nInput Formats\n\nHDMI: 720/59.94p,720/50p(FORMAT switch = 720p)\n\nHDMI: 1080/59.94i,1080/50i,1080/59.94p,\n\n1080/50p(FORMAT switch = 1080i or 1080p)\n\n*The input interlaced video signal is converted to progressive video signal by internal processing.\n\n*The video signal frame rate is selected by SETUP parameters (59.94 or 50).\n\nOutput Formats\n\nHDMI: 720/59.94p,720/50p(FORMAT switch = 720p)\n\nHDMI: 1080/59.94i,1080/50i(FORMAT switch = 1080i)\n\nHDMI: 1080/59.94p,1080/50p(FORMAT switch = 1080p)\n\n*The video signal frame rate is selected by SETUP parameters (59.94 or 50).\n\nVideo Effects\n\nTransition: CUT, MIX (DISSOLVE/FAM/NAM/MOSAIC), WIPE (30 types),\n\nTRANSFORMER(11 types)\n\nEFFECTS: NEGATIVE, EMBOSS, COLORIZE, COLORPASS, POSTERIZE, SILHOUETTE,\n\nMONOCOLOR, FINDEDGE, FLIP, WH-LUMIKEY@, BK-LUMIKEY@,\n\nGR-CHROMAKEY@, BL-CHROMAKEY@, PinP(1/4)@, PinP(1/3)@, PinP(1/2)@,\n\nSPLIT(H-STRETCH)@.
