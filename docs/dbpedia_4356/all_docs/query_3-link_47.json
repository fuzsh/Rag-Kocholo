        "text": "WHAT ARE THE BEST DIGITAL MARKETING CONFERENCES IN 2024 THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ATTEND?\n\nMeet new people, learn new things, spot new business opportunities - what’s not to like about marketing conferences?\n\nThe problem is that not all conferences are created equal. Nor do all of them cater to agencies and marketers.\n\nThis is why we’ve put together this comprehensive list of the world’s top marketing conferences in 2024. All the events listed here focus (either directly or indirectly) on agencies and the people who work in them - creatives, marketers, and managers.\n\nTo make it even easier to stay on top of your favorite events, we’ve also created a printable calendar. Grab your copy below and print it out so you never miss an event again.\n\nGrab your FREE copy of our printable marketing events calendar so you never miss an important event again. Click here to download your PDF.\n\nThe conference industry is booming.\n\nEvery month, there are a handful of marketing-focused events around the country. These can range from glitzy, 50,000-attendee-strong extravaganzas to intimate 500-person workshops.\n\nWhat kind of event you choose to attend will depend on what you hope to get out of the experience. The kind of broad exposure you can get at SXSW or Adobe Summit can’t be matched by a small-scale event.\n\nAt the same time, your learning will be richer, deeper, and more intimate at smaller events.\n\nTo help you out, we’ve included both small and large-scale events in this list. Everything is organized by month to make navigation easier.\n\nDo note that in the case of some conferences, the exact event dates haven’t been announced yet, so we have to go by their dates from last year.\n\nA note about prices: Unless otherwise specified, the event registration prices mentioned below are for a comprehensive pass (or all-access pass) paid at a regular (not early bird) rate. The prices are indicative only; the conference can change them at their discretion.\n\nCONFERENCES IN MARCH:\n\n1. SXSW\n\nLocation: Austin, TX\n\nDates: March 8 -16\n\nPricing: $1,990 for an all-access pass\n\nFocus: Content creation and technology\n\nWebsite\n\nAs an event, SXSW needs no introduction. One of the largest events of its kind, SXSW brings together musicians, filmmakers, technologists, and creatives across industries in a weeklong celebration of creativity and culture.\n\nWhile not an obvious fit for agencies, attending SXSW should still be on your agenda in 2024. The networking opportunities are great, but you’ll also get to know what’s happening on the cutting edge of creativity.\n\n2. Win Without Pitching Miami Workshop\n\nLocation: Online\n\nDates: March 18-21\n\nPricing: $2,795 for an all-access pass\n\nFocus: Agency owners\n\nWebsite\n\nHow exactly do you win clients without any pitching?\n\nThat’s exactly what this conference aims to answer.\n\nFocusing exclusively on agency leaders, this event brings together successful agency owners and veterans to share strategies and insight to win new business. Highly focused and intensive, this hands-on workshop will teach you actionable tactics to start getting valuable clients without the lengthy task of pitching and RFPs.\n\n3. Adobe Summit\n\nLocation: Las Vegas or online\n\nDates: March 26-28\n\nPricing: $2,095 until March 28 for a regular pass. The online pass is free.\n\nFocus: Marketers, creatives, and agencies\n\nWebsite\n\nAs an agency, Adobe sits at the heart of your creative operations. New entrants have tried wrangling away its crown, but Adobe’s creative suite remains the default toolkit for working with images, illustrations, and videos.\n\nSo you can imagine that Adobe’s flagship event, the Adobe Summit, would be a massive event.\n\n2024’s edition promises to be no different. With sessions from heavy hitters, it’s the go-to event for agencies and creatives looking to play in the big leagues.\n\n4.
