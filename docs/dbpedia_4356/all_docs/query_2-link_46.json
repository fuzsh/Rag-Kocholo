It often wonât connect to the Sling app on the first up to the fourth try. The TV apps stall and watching anything on Sling is awful. Thereâs constant stoppages and it will skip ahead to commercials and cut off parts of the shows. Iâve had the shows completely disappear half way through. It will stall and after the commercials that play, a new show is playing. Itâs not just the Sling app that constantly stalls. The commercials work perfectly, I wish the apps did. The adds for Disney+ and other apps come on frequently when I start the tv instead of the Home Screen on start up. The ads get stuck and it is difficult to get to the Home Screen. The surround sound wonât work with the tv. Iâve had support tell me to reset the tv which Iâve done many times, this takes so long! After the long reinstall, I have to go to all of my paid apps and reregister. This takes a long time and itâs so irritating that it doesnât fix anything. The router is next to this tv. The tv on the other side of the house made by another manufacturer works great. I wish I chose another product, Iâm patiently waiting until this tv dies to replace it. I bought a defunct ad machine, they should be paying me for having to view all of the none sense when I should be watching the tv.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nIn the event that an issue does happen, VIZIO strives to provide our customers with the award-winning service and support to ensure issues are handled as quickly and easily as possible.
