        "text": "July 26, 2024\n\nYes! The series adaptation on Prime Video just released and it’s so far freaking good, especially the songs ! And here’s my review for this legendary novel of TJR!\n\nDaisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a captivating and emotional story that explores the rise and fall of a fictional 1970s rock band named The Six, as told through the eyes of their lead singer, Daisy Jones.\n\nThe novel is written in an unconventional format, presented as a transcript of interviews with the band members, their friends, and family, as well as other individuals who were involved in the band's journey. This format is not only unique but also adds a sense of realism to the story, making the reader feel as though they are reading a true account of a band's rise to fame.\n\nThe characters in Daisy and the Six are incredibly well-developed, with each member of the band having their own distinct personality and backstory. Daisy, in particular, is a compelling character, with her raw talent and rebellious spirit causing both admiration and friction among her bandmates.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of the music industry in the 1970s is also fascinating, with the reader getting a glimpse into the excess and indulgence that came with fame during that era. The book's exploration of the band's creative process is also intriguing, as it delves into the complexities of writing and performing music.\n\nOne of the strengths of Daisy and the Six is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in the reader. The highs and lows of the band's journey are felt keenly, and the relationships between the characters are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.\n\nWhat makes Daisy and the Six such a compelling read is the way that Taylor Jenkins Reid captures the spirit of the 1970s music scene. The story is set against a backdrop of social and cultural change, and the author weaves these themes seamlessly into the narrative.\n\nThe book is a love letter to rock and roll, and Jenkins Reid's passion for music shines through in every chapter. She expertly captures the excitement and energy of live performances, and the way that music can bring people together.\n\nBut beyond the music, Daisy and the Six is also a deeply human story about love, loss, and the bonds that connect us. The relationships between the band members are complex and multifaceted, and the novel delves into the various conflicts and tensions that arise as a result.\n\nWhat's more, the book is also a commentary on the nature of fame and the toll that it can take on those who achieve it. The Six are catapulted to stardom almost overnight, and the pressure to maintain their success takes a heavy toll on the band members' personal lives.\n\nIn conclusion, Daisy and the Six is a beautifully written and emotionally resonant novel that will stay with readers long after they finish it. It's a must-read for anyone who loves music, drama, and unforgettable characters, and it's a testament to the enduring power of rock and roll.\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\nmedium blog\n\ninstagram\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nSeptember 20, 2019\n\nDaisy Jones & the Six is a masterpiece. Incredible. Intoxicating. Unforgettable. Truly one of the most remarkable stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The moment I finished, I had to immediately start from the beginning again. I refused to let go. And yes, I did read it twice in a row.\n\nCW: substance abuse/addiction, abortion\n\nSet in the mid sixties – late seventies, Daisy Jones & The Six transports readers to the most iconic age of rock n’ roll. The atmosphere and story composition create and authentic tale that I almost refuse to believe isn’t real! Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master of fiction – her characters possess an uncanny ability to charm readers and settle into their hearts. Her novels are multi-faceted and unlike any other books I’ve read, especially due to the oral history storytelling of Daisy Jones. (Side note – the audiobook? SPECTACULAR. If you have access to the audio version, you will not want to miss this experience) Full of timeless quotes, glamourous scandals, and heart-breaking loss, Daisy Jones & The Six has absolutely climbed to the top as one of my favorite books of all time.\n\nFUCK! THIS BOOK IS SO FEMINIST! The women in this book are all so powerful and dynamic. There are so many strong messages about women empowerment, taking no one’s shit, supporting other women, and demanding credit where it’s due. Even the smaller side characters are them much more layered than most supporting characters, as we explore their own storylines. Plus the relationships between all of the women, (Karen & Daisy, Karen & Camila, Camila & Daisy – even Daisy and little Julia made my heart swell!) are wholesome, unique, and authentic. Especially for a story with a bit of a love triangle, I could not be happier with the superb study of the experience of women.\n\nI also was left so touched by the exploration of addiction. It’s a disease very close to my heart and I’m so, so pleased with how Taylor Jenkins Reid captured the dark, devastating nature of it. The story of both Billy and Daisy’s respective addictions bring light to the glamorization of drugs of this time, while not glamorizing it themselves. This book exposes the truth about substance abuse while simultaneously carrying an air of hope and recovery for those who may be in a similar situation. I’ll stand by this novel my grave as one of the greatest fictional stories of addiction ever told.\n\nAnd oh gosh, THE MUSIC! I just have to give a shout out to the author for writing so many superb original songs with their own distinct voice and sound. I cannot WAIT for the series to come out so I can finally hear these marvelous lyrics sung the way they should be. Again, I REFUSE to believe this isn’t a real band.\n\nI have so few complaints about this book, and honestly, they are so minuscule compared to the novel’s countless strengths. I felt the main plot twist wasn’t all that shocking and the ending could have been stronger compared to the rock-solid build up, but I’m so enchanted by this book that I’m totally unbothered.\n\nIn sum, read Daisy Jones & The Six. Prepare to have your mind rocked by the story of a band that wanted to change the world, so they did.\n\nMarch 19, 2019\n\nI know many people loved this book, and it's not as if I don't see why, but this choice of narration just really didn't work for me. I found Reid's The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo absolutely riveting from the very first chapter, but I thought the decision to write this book entirely in interview transcripts made it really boring and emotionless.\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six is essentially a band documentary transcript. I'm sure most of you have seen a band documentary before. Former band members, their managers, and their friends are all interviewed, and the screen switches between them speaking and images/footage of the band in their prime. This is like that, but without the images to accompany it. Members of The Six, their acquaintances, and Daisy herself, recount the history of the band's rise and fall.\n\nI just… nothing interested me. I didn’t care when they were bickering about how song lyrics should go. Or when they were talking about the sex and drugs lifestyle. They just fly around, play gigs, do drugs, all while Daisy is being a brat and Billy is cheating on his wife. They are the only two characters of interest and they both irritated me.\n\nPerhaps it is because this is a perfect example of what they say a writer shouldn't do: all tell, no show. I mean, that's the nature of having it be an interview transcript. The characters just talk about their experiences, and it all felt very cold and detached. I wasn't immersed in the story; I wasn't experiencing it.\n\nI actually kept reading because the book seemed like maybe it was building to something good. It all feels like its leading up to a shocking climax at their last concert, but even the mystery surrounding that was unsatisfying for me. I was expecting something more juicy and exciting.\n\nOh well. I do think it had a bit of a cool 1970s LA music scene vibe going on. The whirlwind of sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and all that. But it wasn't enough for me. I think the story would have been far more compelling written in the author's usual style. She seems quite good at writing about strong feisty women who get caught up in a vicious industry, but that didn't come across as well here.\n\nBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\nAs someone who is a big fan of oral histories of pop culture things, and as someone who gives a rousing “sign me the hell up” to Taylor Jenkins Reid writing about historical Hollywood in any way: This book is a dream.\n\nWhen I am not reading books, I spend a lot of my time reading in-depth articles. Sometimes these are on subjects I have little to no outside interest in: rich people bickering over preschool traditions, incels getting plastic surgery, whether Taylor Swift’s Fourth of July parties were a mainstay relic of her obsession (and fleeting brush) with the Kennedy family. (All of these are articles I read in the past week.) Alternatively, sometimes these articles are on things I care very much about, like certain comedy podcasts or cult-classic ’90s movies.\n\nThis book is like a combination of both of those, but written by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and also it is 368 pages long.\n\nYou have no idea of the joy its existence brings me.\n\nAnd that’s even before I knew it contained sentences like THIS ONE:\n\n“I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else's muse.\n\nI am not a muse.\n\nI am the somebody.\n\nEnd of fucking story.”\n\nI mean honestly, you guys, come on. What am I supposed to do with that other than love and cherish it and read it in a sitting?\n\nI hope I wasn’t supposed to do anything else. Because all I did was those things.\n\nWell, this book wasn’t perfect. Sure, maybe the oral history format is a little more used to being a lengthy Vulture article than a full-length historical novel, and yes, you could argue that those growing pains are evident more than a handful of times, but it more than makes up for it with the DRAMA.\n\nOh, man, you guys, the DRAMA. Another reason I read a lot of random articles is that I love gossip, but I don’t love it so much when it’s people I know, because then I have to do annoying things like “empathize” and “feel bad” and it ruins my fun. But when I get my drama from celebrities - and, even better, FICTIONAL celebrities - no guilt necessary.\n\nIt’s just so much fun.\n\nThat’s my bottom line!\n\n(lowered to a 3.5 upon reread)\n\n-----------------\n\nreread updates\n\nthe old \"reread a book before the adaptation comes out so you feel like the best bookworm in the world\" trick\n\n------------------\n\npre-review\n\nReese Witherspoon: \"I devoured Daisy Jones & The Six in a day, falling head over heels for it.\"\n\nme: hmm...crazy that i AM reese witherspoon...that we are one and the same...\n\n(this book was really good and i would like for the music in it to be real now, thank you please.)\n\nreview to come\n\nAugust 22, 2023\n\nHave you ever felt like there were two versions of a book out there? There's the version everyone you know reads. The one with the raving reviews. The one that everyone loved. Then there is the version you read. The one that is underwhelming and dry and was nothing at all like what you expected it to be. Have you ever felt that? Because I feel that sometimes.\n\nThis is one such time.\n\nSeriously though, did I read the same book as everyone else?\n\nI was hoping beyond all hope that this would be my first 5-star book of 2019. Yeah, that's right, it's officially April, the FOURTH MONTH OF THE YEAR, and I have yet to read a book that blows me away. And with all the hype around this one, I was really hoping this would be it.\n\nIt was not!\n\nSo, maybe I'm heartless. Maybe I'm just uncool and don't understand what the cool kids are into these days. Maybe this book has some deeper meaning that my immature mind just could not comprehend. Maybe I just suck. Maybe this book secretly sucks too.\n\nMaybe it just wasn't for me.\n\nIt was probably that last one.\n\nBut also maybe not.\n\nFirst of all, these characters. I disliked them all. And I know that they aren't supposed to be likable. They are actually all supposed to be total a**holes. I get that. But even horrible people need to be likable, or at least interesting for the book to work. I personally didn't care for any of them.\n\nDaisy was a total brat. She was mean and spoiled and I just wanted someone to slap some sense into her. She was also the most special of all the snowflakes. It was always mentioned how she was just naturally better than everyone else, how everything came easy to her, and how she was just so absolutely amazing.\n\nBilly was also a jerk, although he was written to be a bit sympathetic. He's a crappy husband and a terrible friend and just overall controlling and kind of annoying.\n\nAll the other characters feel only half-developed and kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nOverall, I didn't like this. Obviously.\n\nI thought I would love it. I didn't. Many of you would like it, I think. It's obvious by the hype that a lot of you do.\n\nThe book is told through interviews and is very character-oriented, meaning that there is basically no actual objective to the plot. That said, I didn't like the characters so this book was not a good match for me.\n\nI hope you like it if you do read it though! Maybe you will have better luck with it!\n\nTW: excessive drug use and addictions, alcoholism, abortion, divorce, toxic marriages\n\nAugust 15, 2024\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six chronicles the rise to superstardom of the fictional band that came to define rock 'n' roll in the late 1907s, as well as the troubles that subsequently led to the band splitting up seemingly overnight and its members never playing together again.\n\nGoing in, I was a little bit wary that I wouldn't connect with this story. I wasn't alive during the 1970s and rock 'n' roll isn't my preferred music genre, so I don't have much in common with the book's settings. But this is Taylor Jenkins Reid, so of course I was hooked right from the start.\n\nTold via interview transcripts of band members and various friends and family, it reads like an intimate first person account. I know some readers felt this interview format made the book feel a bit impersonal, but it had the opposite effect for me. When you can see into so many characters, it automatically makes all them feel real and fleshed out, with their individual personalities, quirks, and baggage.\n\nThe story is raw and evocative, filled with sweet, complicated characters I can't help but connect with. There's complexity and nuance in the way Reid captures the relationships between the band members, each flawed in their own way. With their every success, I cheered for them. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see what happens next.\n\nFor me, the only small letdown was the ending. To be fair, I can't quite separate out if my disappointment is just that I wish the band had stayed together forever, making music and being happy, instead of splitting up. I wanted certain things to happen with the story, but they obviously didn't, and that left me with an unfinished feeling.\n\nTaylor Jenkins Reid is the sort of author who can write about anything, even a topic that I have no interest in or knowledge of, and still make it riveting and poignant. Even though this is an account of a fictional group, I found myself wishing they were real so that I could bask some more in the magic of this band.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSee also, my thoughts on:\n\nThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\n\nCarrie Soto Is Back\n\nMalibu Rising\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧\n\nThis was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

The Rock genre took the world by storm, selling out arenas and gathering heretofore unheard of crowds of obsessed fans.\n\nGroups such as The Who, Led Zeppelin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, AC/DC, and Queen were living large with lifestyles infused with sex, drugs and rock and roll.\n\nThis novel is a fictional profile of one such band, Daisy Jones & the Six.\n\nTold via a highly creative interview format, Daisy Jones & The Six is an exceptional example of that format done wisely. This felt like an episode of VH1's Behind the Music on steroids!\n\nWe follow the band from its inception, through the process, ups-and-downs and the dynamics between the various members of the group.\n\nI have to admit that Daisy was a frustrating character for me. I found her to be selfish and frequently wished I could shake some sense into her.\n\nMy favorite character by far was Karen. I really connected with her and could read an entire novel with her as the main focus.\n\nI started my read of this switching back and forth between my hard copy and the audiobook.\n\nRoughly 35% in, it was clear that the audiobook is absolutely the best way to inhale this story. I highly recommend that experience.\n\nThe full cast truly draws you in. I felt like these people were real.\n\nI was left wanting to hear their songs, buy their album and hang their posters on my wall. Billy had me fangirling like I was in Junior High School again.\n\nThis was my first Taylor Jenkins Reid and I was definitely impressed. She writes with such skill. I cannot wait to pick up some of her other books.\n\nObviously, Evelyn Hugo will be next. I just hope the hype for that holds up as well as this one did!\n\nOctober 22, 2019\n\ni finally got my hands on the audio of this and it is everything i thought it would be - the authenticity, the intrigue, the drama, the rock n’ roll, the emotion. this is a masterpiece and the six are the life and soul of this story. i CANNOT wait for the day when their songs become streamable on spotify.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nthere has been some sort of mistake. this book is labelled as fiction, but that cant be right. there is no way these people arent real and nothing you say will convince me otherwise. daisy jones & the six were the greatest rock ’n roll band of the 70s and thats the tea, henny.\n\nbut in all seriousness. TJR is taking this genre of faux-biographies/interviews and really making it a thing; but more specifically, her thing. between this and ‘the seven husbands of evelyn hugo,’ there is proof that fiction will forever be more appealing than nonfiction. no real life event could be told like the way TJR tells her stories. i am just in awe of her capabilities as an author.\n\n‘daisy jones & the six’ is so unique, so edgy, so sexy, so daring, so raw. its everything i could want and hope for from a story about a rock ’n roll band. and if i had such an amazing experience reading this, i cant even imagine what listening to the audiobook will be like (i kind of wish i had done that first, just because of how the story is presented as a compilation of commentary from interviews) - its gonna blow my tiny little mind! i honestly cant wait!\n\n↠ 5 stars\n\nApril 9, 2022\n\n3.8 ⭐️\n\ni enjoyed most of this but i highly believe it was the best in the very beginning and at the very end. i read this with the audio book and honestly only recommend reading it with the audio book.\n\nit’s a whole ensemble of narrators that really hit the nail on the head with each character. i’m convinced i only enjoyed it because i had the audiobook along side me. for the way it’s written and the format it uses, it works.\n\nthe actual story was simply just ok. i wasn’t wowed away like i usually am with other TJR books. this one is definitely at the bottom but i don’t regret reading it. i was happy with the ending and was satisfied.\n\ni enjoyed most of the characters, tbh i only cared about Graham and Karen for most of it and then Daisy and Billy towards the end. i respect and admire the way addiction is written in this book. reading daisy’s and billy’s struggle with addition and how it affected all those around them was much appreciated.\n\ncan’t wait for the tv adaptation ☺️\n\nJune 15, 2019\n\nIS THIS AS GOOD AS THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO?\n\nThat was my main question when I picked up this book. Sadly, no.\n\nThere was a lot of potential but I felt like the story wasn't flesh out enough. I highly recommend listening to this one as an audiobook due to the format (interviews).\n\nReminded me a bit of A Star Is Born, but maybe less tragic and with a very confident main female character. The characters were definitely attaching but I felt like there should have been more. 300 pages of interview is quite short.\n\nOverall good, would recommend but not a favorite!\n\nAugust 24, 2019\n\nApparently I read a different book than everyone else. Or maybe my brain just thinks it's funny to make me hate hyped books idk.\n\nThis didn't touch me whatsoever. I was bored and the story and some actions of the characters felt repetitive to the point that I skipped some paragraphs. Everything was so predictable and dialogues even felt pretentious sometimes. Trying to be meaningful while actually being pseudo deep (like 80% of tumblr u know?).\n\nSure, this had some great quotes and some funny bits in it but.. that's about it.\n\nMarch 25, 2021\n\n4th read: march 2021 (audiobook)\n\n★★★★\n\n3rd read: april - june 2019 (physical)\n\n★★★★★\n\nyep this is my third time reading this book. i just adore it with my whole heart. this time i physically read it and annotated it, and it was everything.\n\n2nd read: 29-31 march 2019 (audiobook)\n\n★★★★★\n\nUGH I WILL NEVER GET OVER THIS BOOK\n\n1st read: 14-15 march 2019 (audiobook)\n\n★★★★★\n\ncw: drug use, alcoholism, addiction, abortion\n\nJanuary 8, 2023\n\nI enjoyed this one quite a bit! I feel like if I were to have read it physically I wouldn't have liked it as much due to the choppy writing style and the constant switching of perspectives. I definitely understand why this one is getting adapted and I'm excited to see how they execute it. I think my favorite thing about Taylor Jenkins Reid's books is her ability to write characters that feel incredibly real.\n\nJanuary 14, 2024\n\nReread in 2023: I listened to the audiobook and enjoyed it so much more than physically reading it back in 2019! The audiobook production and cast of narrators did a great job in making the characters come to life, and the drama got me gagged. As a physical book it was 3 stars, but as an audiobook I'm bumping it up to 5.\n\nJune 27, 2020\n\nUpdate: it is with a heavy heart that I must announce not a single tear was shed. I felt nothing. I did not actively dislike this book, and there are things I actually liked about it. I just did not care about any of it. The voice actors did a pretty good job, though.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to irreversibly devastated, how much will this book hurt?\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\nI REFUSE TO BELIEVE THIS IS A FICTION AND THESE PEOPLE DON'T EXIST.\n\nApril 19, 2020\n\nI expected this to be good because of the hype but this was truly one of the best things I've read in a long time. And it was MADE to be an audiobook. I'd love to write something like this someday.\n\nJanuary 23, 2022\n\nfighting the feminine urge to kill (almost) all the men featured in this book\n\nMarch 19, 2020\n\n5/5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n“I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else's muse.\n\nI am not a muse.\n\nI am the somebody.\n\nEnd of fucking story. ”\n\nOh fuck. I'm a mess. I'm such a hot mess. I feel like Daisy on crack. I'm a crying mess, I'm a screaming mess, I'm a heartbroken mess. How the fuck am I supposed to continue on with my life now after this book has happened? Could you people do it? I NEED A SEQUEL OR A MOVIE OR A SERIES OR SOMETHING! I'm literally on Youtube right now, trying to find a cover of these songs or anything. I'm so deep I'm gonna fall off. I'm supposed to watch the Oscars in a few hours, and here I am, crying over a fictional rock band.\n\nI have had such a weird history with this book from the get go. You can check out the date I started reading it, fucking March of 2019. You know it's February of 2020 now right? Yeah. I read a 100 pages of this book on March of 2019, in book format and then my book hiatus started. It wasn't because of this book, it just happens to me from time to time. I remember I actually bought it right after I started hearing all the buzz about it, and after having loved her previous work I knew I was gonna love this. But I couldn't have known it would change something in me.\n\nAnd then we come to today. I'm back from my book hiatus, ready to read some good things because it comes back again. And after I read 2 books this year, I saw that I had left this one behind. So, to make things easier for myself, I decided to listen to the audiobook. Which was so praised by everyone when it came out. I have never listened to an audiobook, I can't find myself concentrating to it. Maybe it's because I'm bilingual, or that my mind can't linger on to something for a very long period of time, idk. But I knew this particular audiobook would enhance my experience. Therefore, I started a 30-trial on audible, downloaded it and started listening while also reading it.\n\nIt's one of those books were you check if the band was real, if the people actually existed and you're so convinced it's true. You just know they do because this book feels like it. I feel like calling these people and hear their stories and struggles and worries. I feel like I want to meet them and talk to them. I feel like I want to be them, despite their flaws. That's how perfectly constructed most of these characters are.\n\nI don't know how this author does it with each of her books. How can she make up actual people who feel so like... actual people? So raw, and flawed and complex. Worlds were black and white doesn't exist... but grey does. Like the real world. This woman is a true talent and I will read everything she writes, I swear. I'm just so captivated.\n\nI love rock, I love metal, I love pop. I just love music and rock bands and old music and sometimes new and I just knew I would be drawn to the subject matter of this book. But I never thought it would much more than a rock band book. That it would feel so personal sometimes. That I would sympathize with those people that have nothing in common with me. But the God, named Taylor Jenkins Reid fucking DID THAT!\n\nOverall, read this motherfucking book. Or at best... listen to the audiobook while reading it, speed 2.0. I flew through it in 5 hours, I didn't even drink water. Trust me, don't even pick up this book without listening to the audiobook. K bye!\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nGreat audiobook but not as good as The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo....\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six is a historical fiction book which follows the band, The Six, and Daisy, as they find each other, their spectacular rise, and the end.\n\nThis is my third Taylor Jenkins Reid book, and I would rank them as follows: 1. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo 2. Daisy Jones & The Six 3. Malibu Rising. The audiobook was phenomenal, an incredible performance with an entire cast of characters. Whoever played Daisy had such an incredible voice, raspy, that it was just very unique and captivating. Additionally, it gave the depth and time that it needed. If I read [sigh], I read it super fast and move on, but it feels different when you actually hear a character perform it. The audiobook was definitely five stars.\n\nWhy didn't I rate this book 5 stars? There were a few too many characters. Even now, I am not too sure what value Warren, Eddie, and Pete brought to the story. I also found that this book dragged a bit especially after reading the true life story of David Grohl in The Storyteller. Some hard truth time: I thought Daisy Jones & The Six was real or at least based on a real life band. This is not entirely my fault though. The author put in an author's note that says, \"This book is an attempt to piece together a clear portrait of how the renowned 1970's rock band Daisy Jones & The Six rose to fame.\" Well, liar liar pants on FIRE! Because this is a fictional story. I felt like a sucker for thinking that I could rely on the Author's Note at the beginning of the book.\n\nOverall, an interesting read in an interesting format. This is one of the rare instances where I think that the audiobook is better than the printed format.\n\n2025 Reading Schedule\n\nJan A Town Like Alice\n\nFeb Birdsong\n\nMar Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De Berniere\n\nApr War and Peace\n\nMay The Woman in White\n\nJun Atonement\n\nJul The Shadow of the Wind\n\nAug Jude the Obscure\n\nSep Ulysses\n\nOct Vanity Fair\n\nNov A Fine Balance\n\nDec Germinal\n\nConnect With Me!\n\nBlog Twitter BookTube Insta My Bookstore at Pango\n\nDecember 20, 2022\n\n(Review from original 3/5/19 read-through): I listened to the audiobook and I gotta say, Taylor Jenkins Reid has knocked it out of the park again. I LOVED THIS SO MUCH. This audiobook was one of the best audiobooks I've ever listened to and I am SO GLAD that I decided to take in the story that way. It was narrated by a full cast and I just about died when my girl Judy Greer started speaking in my ear as the voice of Karen Karen. Seriously y'all, so fucking good. I WILL SAY, the reason I'm giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because the book as a whole ends a little unspectacularly. There's so much build up and tension throughout the course of the book and the ending just did not live up to what came before it. I do still HIGHLY recommend you check it out though, and 100% recommend the audiobook. What a wild ride.\n\nTW: copious drug use, alcoholism, addiction, abortion\n\nApril 18, 2019\n\nReally enjoyed this! The audio book was fabulous.\n\nAugust 12, 2021\n\ngonna pretend i didn’t spend 20 minutes searching Daisy Jones and The Six on google and spotify to see if they were real or not\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\n4,5 ⭐️\n\nkaren, conte comigo PRA SEMPRE.\n\nMay 2, 2021\n\nI have read my way through 315 books to bring you my Top 10 Books of the Year (video) .\n\nNow you know that this one made the cut, check out my video review to see the others!\n\nI had absolutely no interest in being somebody else's muse.\n\nI am not a muse.\n\nI am the somebody.\n\nEnd of fucking story.\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six were the hottest thing in the late seventies - and just when they were on the cusp of true fame they broke up.\n\nIt scared me that the only thing between this moment of calm and the biggest tragedy of my life was me choosing not to do it.\n\nDaisy Jones is the It girl of the seventies - her voice, her charisma and her beauty - it's the full package. Everywhere she goes, heads are turning and people are taking note.\n\nThe Six are the band led by Billy Dunne - and they are good in their own right but they just need that extra push to greatness.\n\nSo then a producer realizes...why not put the two together?\n\nAnd that's truly when something worthy of legends develops.\n\nBut just when everything is coming together - when their album, Aurora, is ready to come out...the band breaks up. Shocking millions.\n\nIt’s like some of us are chasing after our nightmares the way other people chase dreams.\n\nEven now, in modern times, Daisy Jones & The Six are still the best band that never was. The one that got away.\n\nAnd so, someone decides to write a novel about it - through interviews and memories - the public is able to watch the rise (and fall) of Daisy Jones and The Six.\n\nOh, my, gosh.\n\nThis one.\n\nIt was amazing.\n\nThis is the kind of book where you just have to set it down for a while and really revel in a story well-told.\n\nHow am I supposed to live my life knowing this band never existed???\n\nIt was SO immersive that I literally spent 10 minutes googling songs from their \"album\" just to double check that this band didn't exist.\n\nThis was told in a series of interviews and minor flashbacks. The way it was stitched together and the narrative that emerged was so incredible.\n\nThe audiobook was...truly a notch above all others.\n\nEach character had a different voice actor/actress and they were all truly perfect. They felt so real.\n\nThis one read like a miniseries and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\n\nYouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\n4.5 - this was so good on audio! Told in an interview format, so it's an interesting way to learn about the story. Really not a huge fan of books about music or bands, but this one was good! Also that twist at the end, did not see that coming at all!"
