        "text": "Did you know that there are over 70 pop songs in Moulin Rouge! The Musical? From Offenbach to Adele, Britney Spears to Sia, and David Bowie to Beyonce, the Moulin Rouge! The Musical score is a true musical theatre feat. Collectively, the songs bring turn-of-the-century France to life, and keep the red windmill spinning.\n\nMoulin Rouge! The Musical tells the story of Christian, a struggling American composer who seeks inspiration at the Moulin Rouge, a Parisian cabaret known for its luxury and splendour. There, he locks eyes with Satine, the dazzling performer who commands centre stage — and will eventually command his heart. Expect to hear the Moulin Rouge! film favourites in the stage adaptation, like \"Come What May,\" as well as dozens of newer, chart-topping hits to bring the story into the 21st century.\n\nFind out more about the songs in Moulin Rouge! The Musical, and get ready for a spectacular, spectacular for your ears and your eyes.\n\nBook Moulin Rouge! The Musical tickets on London Theatre.\n\n\"Lady Marmalade\" — Labelle\n\nHey sista, soul sista! \"Lady Marmalade\" was originally sung by Labelle, and first released in 1974. The song quickly became controversial due to its sexually explicit French lyrics; however the suggestive lines lend themselves well to the lascivious Moulin Rouge. The track was re-released for the 2001 film, sung by Christina Aguilera, Mýa, Pink, and Lil' Kim.\n\n\"So Fresh, So Clean\" — Outkast\n\nOutkast released \"So Fresh, So Clean\" as a single to support their fourth studio album, Stankonia, in 2004. The Outkast song is sampled in Moulin Rouge! The Musical, but the original hit uses samples too — \"Before the Night Is Over\" by Joe Simon features on the 2004 track.\n\n\"Rhythm of the Night\" — DeBarge\n\nThe dance-pop track \"Rhythm of the Night\" quickly became DeBarge's best-selling hit, and earned a spot on the 1985 Billboard Hot 100. Wherever you sit in the Piccadilly Theatre auditorium, feel the upbeat \"Rhythm of the Night\" in the opening moments of Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\n\"Because We Can\" — Fatboy Slim\n\nAudiences can't-can't-can't get the Moulin Rouge! The Musical songs out of their heads, and this song is the resident earworm. Fatboy Slim's 1998 song was first recorded for the Moulin Rouge! film. Twenty years later, a chorus of can-can dancers highkick to this song eight times a week onstage.\n\n\"The Sound of Music\" — Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein\n\nThe hills are alive... with the sound of Moulin Rouge! The Musical. The Sound of Music is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best-known musicals. The Sound of Music follows a woman who makes many life-changing decisions — kind of like cabaret performer Satine in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. Could you climb ev'ry mountain with Christian and Satine?\n\n\"I Don't Want To Wait\" — Paula Cole\n\nHave you ever watched Dawson's Creek? Well then you may recognise Paula Cole's 1997 song, \"I Don't Want to Wait\" in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. As well as being a television theme tune, the song was rated one of the top songs of the 1990s by VH1. Don't wait to see Moulin Rouge! The Musical in London.\n\n\"Every Breath You Take\" — The Police\n\nOnce the curtain falls on Moulin Rouge! The Musical, you'll be missing this show forevermore. Christian sings \"Every Breath You Take\" to himself when he first lands in Paris. It's not the only The Police song in the musical either, so keep reading to find out the other song.\n\n\"Never Gonna Give You Up\" — Rick Astley\n\nWe're not rick-rolling you, we promise. Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" is in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. The original 1987 song became so popular that it helped Rick Astley won Best Act Ever at the MTV Europe Music Awards. You can believe us, we're not gonna tell a lie and hurt you.\n\n\"Royals\" — Lorde\n\nLorde's 2013 debut single \"Royals\" put the New Zealander firmly on the musical map. Lorde won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year with \"Royals,\" and the song has sold over 22 million copies. It's the perfect song for bohemians Toulouse-Lautrec and Santiago to sing together in Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\n\"Children of the Revolution\" — T-Rex\n\nWelcome to the Moulin Rouge! The Musical revolution. Moulin Rouge is not just a physical place — it's a state of mind. \"Children of the Revolution\" debuted in 1972, and Elton John featured on the original recording.\n\n\"We Are Young\" — Fun\n\nMoulin Rouge! The Musical is a fun show. Add a song by Fun into the mix, and Moulin Rouge! The Musical is definitely the most fun night out you can have in London. Toulouse-Lautrec and Santiago sing Fun's 2011 song \"We Are Young\" to describe how they are still children at heart.\n\n\"Diamonds Are Forever\" — Shirley Bassey\n\nJohn Barry wrote \"Diamonds Are Forever\" for the 1971 James Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever. Shirley Bassey sung the original Bond theme, however the song has since been sampled in hip hop songs too, such as Kanye West's \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone.\" In Moulin Rouge! The Musical, \"Diamonds Are Forever\" showcases the club's sparkling diamond, Satine.\n\n\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" — Carol Channing\n\nCarol Channing sang this jazz melody in the 1949 musical, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Marilyn Monroe later popularised the song when she covered the track in the 1953 film of the same name. If diamonds are a girl's best friend, then sample cuts are a friend of Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\n\"Material Girl\" — Madonna\n\nAre you living in the real world, or a material world? Escape the real world when you hear the opening chords of \"Material Girl\" in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. \"Material Girl\" made Madonna a musical icon, and the song does the same for Satine as she sings centre stage.\n\n\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" — Beyoncé\n\nIf you like musicals, then put a ring on it by booking Moulin Rouge! The Musical tickets instead. Although the original \"Single Ladies\" choreography does not feature in the stage show, the 2008 track ends the \"Sparkling Diamond\" medley with a bang.\n\n\"Shut Up And Dance\" — Walk The Moon\n\nDon't you dare look back on this 2014 song. Walk the Moon singer, Nicholas Petricca, based the song \"Shut Up and Dance\" on an experience at a nightclub in Los Angeles. He was invited to dance by a stranger, which later sparked a love affair. Apply this story to Moulin Rouge! The Musical, and it's the perfect upbeat song to kick off a romantic medley.\n\n\"Raise Your Glass\" — Pink\n\nPink released \"Raise Your Glass\" in 2010 as a celebratory anthem to champion her fans who had followed her decade-long career. Now, \"Raise Your Glass\" is in Moulin Rouge! The Musical to say cheers to Christian and Satine's relationship.\n\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" — Whitney Houston\n\nYou'll be grooving in the aisles when you hear Whitney Houston's Grammy Award-winning dance hit. The 1987 dance-pop track is sung by the Moulin Rouge! The Musical company, and all the cabaret performers showcase their latest moves in the crowd.\n\n\"Firework\" — Katy Perry\n\nIn the Moulin Rouge! The Musical, Satine sings \"Firework\" as a heartfelt ballad, as she reflects on her life and trials. She trys to stay strong for her fellow performers, but also knows she will struggle more with each day. Hope you've got your tissues at the ready!\n\n\"Your Song\" — Elton John\n\nWe hope you don't mind that we've put down in words just how wonderful \"Your Song\" is in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. Elton John and Bernie Taupin collaborated to pen the 1970 ballad, which tells of a young man who reveals his true self to others, and himself. In the musical, Christian sings \"Your Song\" to share who he really is — and his true feelings — to Satine.\n\n\"Sympathy For The Devil\" — The Rolling Stones\n\nRock out at Moulin Rouge! The Musical as soon as you hear \"Sympathy for the Devil.\" The critically-acclaimed song was originally titled \"The Devil is My Name,\" and even though Mick Jagger voiced Satan in the original hit, it's still a devilishly good track.\n\n\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" — The Rolling Stones\n\nThe Rolling Stones's music continues with their 1969 hit. The track focuses on bohemian values: love, politics, and drugs. Rolling Stone magazine put the song in its \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list, but it's just one of over 50 chart-topping songs throughout Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\n\"Gimme Shelter\" — The Rolling Stones\n\nA song all about war, murder, and fear may not seem conducive to the glitz and glamour of Moulin Rouge! The Musical. However, the song's earthy feel lends itself beautifully to the stage show. The Rolling Stones themselves claim they've never made a better song, and Moulin Rouge! The Musical showcases the shining effects of \"Gimme Shelter.\"\n\n\"Nature Boy\" — Nat King Cole\n\nAmerican jazz singer Nat King Cole first sang \"Nature Boy\" in 1948, but songwriter Eden Ahbez wronte the song in honour of German-American hippie, Bill Pester. David Bowie covered \"Nature Boy\" for the 2001 Moulin Rouge! film.\n\n\"All You Need is Love\" — The Beatles\n\nLove is all you need in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. The Beatles's 1967 song \"All You Need is Love\" features in the show, kicking off the iconic \"Elephant Love Medley.\"\n\n\"Just One Night\" — McBride and Ride\n\nHeard of McBride and Ride? Neither have we. Seeing Moulin Rouge! The Musical may take place over one afternoon or evening, but the memories will stay with you forever. The 1992 country song topped the charts, and now it's part of the \"Elephant Love Medley.\"\n\n\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" — U2\n\nIn the name of love, we recommend seeing Moulin Rouge! The Musical at the Piccadilly Theatre. The U2 song, \"Pride\" has been sampled in many medleys, such as the Moulin Rouge! The Musical \"Elephant Love Medley,\" and the Roots's 2007 \"Pride\" medley.\n\n\"Can't Help Falling in Love With You\" — Elvis Presley\n\nElvis Presley's music catalogue stands the test of time. So when you hear his music in Moulin Rouge! The Musical, it'll sound just as current as the 2010s music. During this song in the musical, Christian is consumed by his love for Satine, however their relationship won't stay fiery forever.\n\n\"Don't Speak\" — No Doubt\n\nBefore Gwen Stefani had a solo career, she led the American rock band, No Doubt. Their most well-known hit, \"Don't Speak\" is in the \"Elephant Love Medley\" in the stage show. The original song was a breakup song to mark the end of a seven-year relationship. You won't get the seven year itch at Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\n\"I Love You Always Forever\" — Donna Lewis\n\nMany musicals are based on books, but songs based on books are rarer. Donna Lewis's 1996 song is inspired by a novel: H. E. Bates' Love for Lydia. Christian and Satine declare their love for one another to this song in the \"Elephant Love Medley.\"\n\n\"It Ain't Me Babe\" — Bob Dylan\n\nEver since Bob Dylan released the song in 1964, many artists have covered the folk hit. Johnny Cash sang it as a duet with June Carter, and Nancy Sinatra, Bryan Ferry, and Kesha have also sung \"It Ain't Me Babe\" live. Now, the Moulin Rouge! The Musical cast bring Bob Dylan back to the London stage.\n\n\"Love Hurts\" — Everly Brothers\n\nThe Everly Brothers recorded the song in 1960, but Boudleaux Bryant worked on the original song. Since then, Roy Orbison, Cher, and Jim Capaldi have covered the country track. \"Love Hurts\" for Christian and Satine throughout the musical, and you'll have to watch the show to find out why.\n\n\"Love is a Battlefield\" — Pat Benatar\n\nNavigating relationships is difficult for anyone. So when Christian and Satine face commitment worries, they're bound to struggle. This song acts as foreshadowing to their Act Two issues, and how their love will become an emotional battlefield.\n\n\"Play the Game\" — Queen\n\nCould you play hard alongside the Moulin Rouge! The Musical characters? It'd be difficult to live in turn-of-the-century Paris, but dancing underneath the twinkling lights would make up for it. Queen released \"Play The Game\" in 1980, and the band's frontman Freddie Mercury wrote the hit.\n\n\"Such Great Heights\" — The Postal Service\n\nNo, the Royal Mail did not write this song. \"Such Great Heights\" is by American indie band, The Postal Service, and gained popularity in the mid-2000s. \"Such Great Heights\" is all about the happy sensations you feel when you first fall in love with someone.\n\n\"Torn\" — Lis Sørensen\n\nEveryone knows \"Torn\" as Natalie Imbruglia's debut single, released in 1997. However, Lis Sørensen released \"Torn\" a decade earlier, and Danish band, Ednaswap, covered the song. \"Torn\" was the most-played song on UK radios in the 1990s, so it's no wonder audiences react positively to \"Torn\" in Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\n\"Take On Me\" — A-ha\n\nA-ha's best-known song \"Take On Me\" continues the aforementioned Danish theme in the \"Elephant Love Medley.\" In the musical, the song implies how the characters must lean on each other for emotional support.\n\n\"Fidelity\" — Regina Spektor\n\nEven though Regina Spektor has released eight albums, her 2007 song, \"Fidelity\", is her only song to make the Billboard charts. \"Fidelity\" is inspired by the movie, High Fidelity — another movie that has since been adapted into a musical.\n\n\"What's Love Got to Do With It\" — Tina Turner\n\nThis Tina Turner song currently features in two West End musicals: Moulin Rouge! The Musical and Tina: The Tina Turner Musical. \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" currently sits in the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Everlasting Love\" — Robert Knight\n\nMoulin Rouge! The Musical could be an everlasting hit in the West End. Its soundtrack definitely sticks in our mind, especially once we hear the 1967 soul hit, \"Everlasting Love.\" Since the original release, Gloria Estefan and Jamie Cullum have covered the song.\n\n\"Up Where We Belong\" — Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes\n\nJoe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes sung \"Up Where We Belong\" for the 1992 film, An Officer and a Gentlemen. Love definitely lifts the characters in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. Listen out for a snippet of this song towards the end of Act One.\n\n\"Heroes\" — David Bowie\n\nThe David Bowie song was released in 1977, however it gained a new-found popularity after David Bowie passed away in 2016. Music critics consider \"Heroes\" as an anthem that best embodies the human spirit. Be your own theatre hero and see Moulin Rouge! The Musical in London.\n\n\"Come What May\" — Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor\n\n\"Come What May\" was the only original song written for the 2001 Moulin Rouge! film? \"Come What May\" is also the musical's romantic love theme. Listen out for \"Come What May\" multiple times during the show.\n\n\"I Will Always Love You\" — Dolly Parton\n\nWhile you may assume that Whitney Houston first sung this ballad, \"I Will Always Love You\" is actually Dolly Parton's sung. Dolly Parton wrote \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"Jolene\" in one day! Houston's 1992 cover for The Bodyguard gave the song a newfound popularity.\n\n\"Bad Romance\" — Lady Gaga\n\nDo Moulin Rouge! The Musical characters want a good, or a bad romance? At the start of Act Two, there's an electrifying dance routine between Nini and Santiago to this Lady Gaga hit, performed as part of the \"Backstage Romance\" medley. Listen out for the French lyric in \"Bad Romance\" too — ideal for the iconic Parisian cabaret.\n\n\"Tainted Love\" — Gloria Jones\n\nYou may know the 1980s Soft Cell synth cover of \"Tainted Love,\" but \"Tainted Love\" was originally recorded as a Northern soul track. When the song first came out in the 1960s, it failed to gain any commercial traction. A decade later, the song became a hit at Northern clubs, and partygoers danced to it until the early hours.\n\n\"Seven Nation Army\" — The White Stripes\n\nThe \"Seven Nation Army\" bass guitar riff has been stuck in our heads for nearly 20 years, and Moulin Rouge! The Musical ensures the track will remain in musical history forevermore. The song gained its title due to White Stripes songwriter, Jack White, mishearing \"The Salvation Army\". But now, there's a legion of fans who'll subscribe to the Seven Nation Army, whether it's the original version, or this musical cover.\n\n\"Toxic\" — Britney Spears\n\nBritney Spears' \"Toxic\" could have been an original track for Moulin Rouge! The Musical. The song stresses how falling in love is like a drug — once you're wooed by someone, you're hooked by their every moment. \"Toxic\" is in the \"Backstage Romance\" medley.\n\n\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" — Eurythmics\n\nThe Eurythmics gained worldwide popularity thanks to their 1983 track, \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This.) But what is \"this\" for the Moulin Rouge! The Musical characters? Only time will tell in the musical, and you'll have to see the show to find out more.\n\n\"Only Girl (In the World)\" — Rihanna\n\nCould Satine be the Duke of Monroth's only girl in the world? That's what he'd like to think. Rihanna's anthem was originally a song to empower females, but the song is spun on its head in the show, as the Duke of Monroth sings for Satine's heart. The original track won Best Dance Recording at the Grammy Awards, so it's a great choice for a dance-heavy musical like Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\n\"Shake It Out\" — Florence and the Machine\n\nDo regrets collect for Moulin Rouge! The Musical characters? Possibly. They behave in questionable ways, but ultimately they're drawn to each other by love. The original Florence and the Machine gospel anthem charted worldwide, and was Grammy-nominated in 2012.\n\n\"Chandelier\" — Sia\n\nEven though \"Chandelier\" was the lead song from Sia's sixth album, the emotional song shot Sia to superstardom in 2014. The melancholy song is sung in Moulin Rouge! The Musical by Harold Zidler during an absinthe drinking session.\n\n\"Roxanne\" — The Police\n\nThe Police's \"Roxanne\" found new popularity in the early 2000s, thanks to the Moulin Rouge! film. The original song details a man who falls in love with a prostitute, but in the Moulin Rouge! The Musical, it's Christian's chance to let loose and really show what he's thinking. \"Roxanne\" has a stagey name too — the song title is inspired by Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\n\"Crazy\" — Gnarls Barkley\n\nWill Moulin Rouge! The Musical make you go crazy? Maybe. Come back to Earth with the powerful mashup, \"Crazy Rolling\". The 2006 Gnarls Barkley song \"Crazy\" set a new standard for 21st-century jazz, and was labelled the song of the 2000s by Rolling Stones Magazine.\n\n\"Rolling in the Deep\" — Adele\n\nMost of Adele's songs will make you cry, but \"Rolling in the Deep\" is an emotional powercharger of a song. In the \"Crazy Rolling\" medley, \"Rolling in the Deep\" details just how much has changed at the Moulin Rouge! club. The dark blues song came out in 2010, and Linkin Park and Aretha Franklin have covered the song.\n\n\"Hey Ya!\" — Outkast\n\nWhile wiggling a polaroid around is not recommended for using a Polaroid camera, you can shake it like a polaroid picture during the Moulin Rouge! The Musical encore. Outkast's 2003 dance track features at the end of the show to bring the party to the Piccadilly Theatre!\n\n\"Minnie the Moocher\" — Cab Calloway\n\nSay \"hi de hi de hi de hi\" to Moulin Rouge! The Musical when you hear this Cab Calloway ditty. The 1931 jazz scat was the first jazz record to sell over a million copies. The catchy scat is sung numerous times throughout the show — why not count how many times you hear it live.\n\n\"Don't You Want Me\" — The Human League\n\nThe Human League's \"Don't You Want Me\" continues the musical's trend to incorporate 1980s dance tracks. Satine may not be a waitress in a cocktail bar, but Moulin Rouge! The Musical does follow two people who meet in chance situations.\n\n\"Galop Infernal\" — Jacques Offenbach\n\nJacques Offenbach's 19th-century opera, Orpheus in the Underworld, follows the ancient legends of Orpheus and Eurydice. Their tales are dramatised in Hadestown, which is currently on Broadway. But if you're looking for an operatic flourish, listen out for the \"Galop Infernal\" in Moulin Rouge! The Musical. The Moulin Rouge in Paris adopted the opera into its cabaret shows from the late 1800s, and this tradition continues in the stage production.\n\nWhat songs are in Moulin Rouge! The Musical?\n\nThere are over 55 songs featured in Moulin Rouge! The Musical in the West End. Listen out for songs from the Moulin Rouge! film including \"Come What May\" sung by Christian. There's also the Act One closer, the \"Elephant Love Medley\" that uses 13 separate songs throughout the mix. Listen to all the Moulin Rouge!
