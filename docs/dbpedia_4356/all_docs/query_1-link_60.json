        "text": "Extension of TM2 inverts the response of Tar\n\nTo better understand the mechanism of transmembrane signaling in E. coli chemoreceptors, we constructed a series of Tar mutants where the TM2 helix was shortened by one or two amino acids or extended by up to three amino acids (Fig. 1a, b). Signaling properties of these receptors were characterized using a reporter based on Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET)54,55. This assay monitors the interaction between CheY fused to yellow fluorescent protein (CheY–YFP) and its phosphatase CheZ fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CheZ–CFP). Because this interaction requires CheY phosphorylation by CheA, increased CheA activity results in a stronger FRET signal and therefore a higher ratio of the YFP to CFP fluorescence.\n\nThese mutant receptors were first expressed from a plasmid in the strain VS18154 that lacks all endogenous receptors but contains CheR and CheB adaptation enzymes. Under our growth and induction conditions (see Methods), the expression of Tar is several fold higher than its native expression level55 and comparable to the total level of receptor expression in the wild-type E. coli. We observed that, except for TarTM2-2, all other constructs could still mediate responses to the amino acid ligand of Tar, α-methyl-d,l-aspartate (MeAsp) (Fig. 1b–d and Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). However, whereas cells expressing TarTM2+1I or TarTM2-1 showed an attractant response that was similar to the wild-type Tar, constructs that carried two or three isoleucine insertions in TM2, TarTM2+2I or TarTM2+3I, elicited an opposite, repellent response (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary Fig. 1c, and Table 1). Interestingly, the apparent cooperativity of the observed response, characterized by the Hill coefficient of the fit to the data54, was significantly lower for the inverted response (2.4 ± 0.3 for the wild-type Tar and 0.7 ± 0.1 for TarTM2+2I). This lower cooperativity might be related to the seemingly lower clustering efficiency of TarTM2+2I (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nThis response inversion was further confirmed in a microfluidic assay56 (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 3). The receptorless strain UU125057 expressing the wild-type Tar showed the expected attractant response to MeAsp, with fluorescently labeled cells drifting up the MeAsp gradient in the observation channel of the device and also moving from the sink pore into the observation channel (Fig. 1e). In contrast, TarTM2+2I mediated a repellent response, with cells drifting down the gradient of MeAsp and thus out of the observation channel into the sink pore (Fig. 1f).\n\nIn the adaptation-deficient cheRcheB background strain VH134, only the wild-type Tar and TarTM2+2I exhibited a response to MeAsp (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4), while other receptor mutants did not respond to MeAsp or to the established repellent NiCl229. The methylation system is thus apparently able to tune the modification state and thus activity of these receptors to an intermediate level, restoring their sensitivity to chemoeffectors. Importantly, however, changes in receptor methylation did not affect the sign of the response, since TarTM2+2I exhibited a similar repellent response in both backgrounds.\n\nTo verify that the observed sign inversion is not a consequence of incorporation of the bulk side chains of two isoleucines in TM2, we constructed another mutant with two alanines inserted at the same position (TarTM2+2A). Similar to TarTM2+2I, this mutant produced a repellent response to MeAsp (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Furthermore, TarV200IV201I where two TM2 residues were mutated to isoleucines still retained the attractant response to MeAsp (Supplementary Fig. 1e), confirming that it is the length of TM2 and not specific sequence that is important to reverse the signal.\n\nSimulations suggest mechanism of the response inversion in the TM2 mutant\n\nTo investigate how chemotactic responses can be inverted by the extension of TM2, we carried out MD simulations of the TM part of the wild-type and mutant Tar in lipid bilayers. Since the Tar dimer binds ligand with negative and half-of-the-sites cooperativity58, here we compared the conformations of the TM helices in the ligand-free state in which both periplasmic ligand binding sites are free (apo-apo or AA) with the ligand-bound state in which a ligand is bound to one of the two binding sites in a dimer (apo-holo or AH). Our simulations used the previously established structural model of the receptor fragment12, which combines the structure of a part of the periplasmic domain and the transmembrane helices of E. coli Tar with the structure of the HAMP domain of Archaeoglobus fulgidus receptor Af15039 (see Methods). Previous MD simulations of this model were consistent with experimental observations12, and Tar with the native HAMP being replaced with Af1503 HAMP retained signaling capability9, altogether suggesting that this truncated hybrid model can reproduce conformational changes within the full-length native Tar22. This structure was embedded into a lipid bilayer consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and simulated at 323 K, as widely applied for membrane proteins7,12,59. Notably, simulation time (800 ns) was apparently sufficient for the model structures of the wild-type and mutant Tar to equilibrate in either AA or AH states, as assessed by examining by the Cα root mean-square deviations (RMSD) from the initial structures as a function of time (Supplementary Fig. 5).\n\nWe observed that both the TM helices and the HAMP domain of the wild-type Tar adapted distinctly different conformations in the AA and AH states (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Conformations assumed by TarTM2+2I were also different between the AA and AH states, but distinct from the corresponding wild-type structure (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Because the rigidity change of the junction between TM2 helix and the HAMP domain was suggested to be crucial for signal transmission12,13,14,15,16, we calculated the average helicity of residues 211GIRRMLLT218 (all the residue numbers here and below correspond to the wild-type Tar) connecting TM2 and AS1 of the HAMP domain (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 7). These residues include the control cable16 (GIRRM) and the first three residues (LLT) of AS1. We observed that for the wild-type Tar the helicity increased from 55% for the AA state to 74% for the ligand-occupied monomer of AH state (Fig. 2c). This agrees with the previous simulation-based model suggesting that the piston motion from α4 helix of periplasmic domain upon ligand binding results in slight bending of TM2 and enhances the rigidity and helicity of the control cable12. We further observed that for TarTM2-1 and TarTM2+1I the simulated helicity of the junction region was only somewhat higher for the AA state compared to the wild-type Tar, and the helicity further increased upon transition to the AH state, apparently consistent with their wild-type like responses. In contrast, for TarTM2+2I the simulated helicity of these junction residues showed a marked decrease in the ligand-occupied monomer, suggesting that this junction becomes less α-helical and rigid upon ligand binding. Interestingly, the average helicity of the junction residues in the ligand-free monomer of the AH state also slightly increased in wild-type Tar while decreasing in TarTM2+2I as compared to the corresponding AA states (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that the ligand-free monomer may also be involved in signal transduction. We propose that the opposite change in helicity of the TM2–AS1 junction upon ligand binding might explain the response inversion in case of TarTM2+2I.\n\nTo ensure that these results are qualitatively independent the type of lipid, temperature, or on the length of the simulated receptor fragment, we repeated MD simulations for the wild-type Tar and TarTM2+2I fragments that contain additional MH bundle connecting the HAMP domain (see below), with another widely used lipid, phosphatidylcholine (POPC)25, and at 300 K (Supplementary Fig. 8). These simulations yielded qualitatively similar changes in helicity of the junction residues (Supplementary Fig. 9), confirming that our conclusions are indeed robust.\n\nWe additionally analyzed the time-evolution of secondary structure for the junction residues 211GIRRMLLT218 in detail using the DSSP program60 (Supplementary Fig. 10). For wild-type Tar (Supplementary Fig. 10a), residues G211, I212, and R213 of the control cable adopt more stable α-helix structures upon ligand binding. L216 of AS1 also shows an increased helicity in the ligand-occupied monomer, consistent with a higher helicity of its junction region (Fig. 2c). For TarTM2+2I (Supplementary Fig. 10b), ligand binding on the contrary largely decreases the helicity of these residues in the ligand-occupied monomer. Our results indicates that R213, R214, and M215 of the control cable generally favor helical structure, while stimulus input modulates helicity of most other junction residues, including G211 and I212 that were previously shown to be important for signaling in the control cable of chemoreceptor Tsr15. Interestingly, T218 adapted coil structure in all simulations, due to the kink on AS1 helix generated by P219. This might generally decrease the helicity of the residues L216 and L217, thus facilitating its modulation by stimulation both for the wild-type Tar and TarTM2+2I.\n\nTo further elucidate the details of the response inversion in TarTM2+2I, we analyzed the conformational changes of TM2 in the AA and AH states by calculating its bending angle12 (Supplementary Fig. 11a, Supplementary Table 1) and the time evolution of helix curvature profile using HELANAL module61 of MDAnalysis62 (Supplementary Fig. 11b). We found that the bending angle of TM2 in the AA state of TarTM2+2I is similar to the TM2 of the ligand-occupied monomer in the AH state of wild-type Tar. However, in the AH state of TarTM2+2I, the TM2 of the occupied monomer bends even further around the residue Leu205 near the end of TM2 (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 11b). The bending of TM2 breaks the helix structure around Leu205, which can be observed from the beginning of production simulations for TarTM2+2I. The respective bending angles of TM2 in the AA and AH states of wild-type Tar and TarTM2+2I (Supplementary Table 1) are consistent with the helix curvature profiles (Supplementary Fig. 11b).\n\nWe also calculated the average longitudinal distance of the residues in the control cable and AS1 to the mass center of all phosphorus atoms at the lipid–cytoplasm interface (interface C, Supplementary Fig. 12a) in the AA and AH states of wild-type Tar and TarTM2+2I. When compared with the AA state, the ligand-promoted asymmetric bending of TM2 of the occupied monomer in the corresponding AH state results in a inward displacement of the control cable and AS1 in wild-type Tar (Supplementary Fig. 12b, d). In contrast, the control cable and AS1 displacement in TarTM2+2I is outward (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d). The movement of control cable is smaller than that of AS1 because the aromatic anchor residues in TM2 (Fig. 1a) and the protein–lipid interactions (Supplementary Fig. 13) fix the position of TM2 and hinder the further displacement of the control cable. The sliding of these residues is consistent with the longitudinal position of the residue Ile220 on AS1 in the ligand-occupied monomer relative to Ile220′ on AS1′ in the ligand-free monomer (Supplementary Fig. 12a, Supplementary Table 2), where Ile220 shows inward movement relative to Ile220′ in the AH state of wild-type Tar while moving outward in TarTM2+2I. Consequently, whereas the movement of the control cable produces an inward sliding of AS1 relative to AS1′ in the wild-type Tar, it results in an outward relative sliding of AS1 in TarTM2+2I (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c). Similar results were obtained by simulating longer structure in POPC at 300 K (Supplementary Table 2). The sliding of AS1 from the occupied monomer might change the side-chain interactions at the AS1–AS1′ interface in the HAMP dimer. No obvious helix rotation was observed in the HAMP domain along with the sliding of AS1, which is different from several previous reports9,17 but consistent with other studies10,23.\n\nWe next specifically explored the role of protein–lipid interactions in signaling to the HAMP domain. Because electrostatic interactions make major contribution to the protein–lipid interactions, we calculated the average electrostatic interactions between the TM2–AS1 junction residues 210YGIRRMLLTP219 and the lipid bilayer in the AA and AH states of wild-type Tar and TarTM2+2I (Supplementary Fig. 13a). In the wild-type Tar, the inward displacement of the control cable and AS1 in the ligand-occupied monomer stabilizes the protein–lipid interactions and consequently the helical structure of these junction residues (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the outward displacement of the control cable and AS1 in TarTM2+2I changes the environment of the junction residues and destabilizes the protein–lipid interactions, thus decreasing the helicity of the junction region. Our simulations further suggest that changes of electrostatic interactions are mainly triggered by the interactions of residues R213 and R214 with the lipids. Moreover, the calculated electrostatic potential is consistent with the time average number of hydrogen bonds formed between these junction residues and the lipids, which increases in the AH state of wild-type Tar but decreases in the AH state of TarTM2+2I (Supplementary Fig. 13b).\n\nThese changes further influence the conformational dynamics of the control cable and HAMP domain, as indicated by the analyzed root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF, Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplementary Table 3). The control cable and AS1 in the AH state of wild-type Tar has lower RMSF than the AA state, and inverse is true for TarTM2+2I, indicating that ligand binding decreases the dynamics of the control cable and AS1 in wild-type Tar while increases their dynamics in TarTM2+2I. It is interesting that for the wild-type Tar simulations indicate an increased dynamics of AS2 in the AH state of wild-type Tar (Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplementary Table 3), which is opposite to the dynamic changes of AS1. Previous study proposed that the HAMP domain is stabilized in the kinase-off (ligand-bound) state, while it is destabilized in the kinase-on state20,23,24. Our study indicates that this stablization is limited to AS1. Finally, although chemotactic signals are initially triggered by the ligand-occupied monomer of Tar, the conformational dynamics of the control cable and AS1 in the ligand-free monomer change similarly to the ligand-occupied monomer (Supplementary Fig. 14), consistent with involvement of the ligand-free monomer in signaling.\n\nTo summarize, our results strongly suggest that the ligand-promoted bending of TM2 in wild-type Tar triggers an inward shift of the control cable and AS1 and strengthens the protein–lipid interactions, thereby stabilizing the helicity of junction region, decreasing the conformational dynamics of the control cable and AS1, and increasing the dynamics of AS2 (Fig. 2d). In TarTM2+2I, the further bending of TM2 instead triggers an outward shift of the control cable and AS1 and weakens the protein–lipid interactions, which decreases the helicity of junction region and increases the dynamics of the control cable and HAMP domain, thus eliciting an inverted response.\n\nResponse inversion by mutations after the HAMP domain\n\nWe next explored whether signaling could also be inverted by mutations in other regions of Tar, using the junction between the HAMP domain and the MH bundle as an example. To screen for such potential inversion mutants, we randomized five residues 267HVREG271 connecting AS2 and the first methylation helix (MH1) (Fig. 3a). This receptor library was subsequently used for the selection of constructs that mediated spreading down the gradient of MeAsp established on a soft agar plate (Supplementary Fig. 15). The selection yielded constructs with the linker sequences 267GVPQM271 (TarHAMP_GVPQM), 267TLPRY271 (TarHAMP_TLPRY), and 267VVPAY271 (TarHAMP_VVPAY), all of which were confirmed to respond to MeAsp as a repellent in both of the FRET (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Fig. 16a, b) and microfluidic assays (Fig. 3d). The apparent cooperativity of inverted response mediated by TarHAMP_GVPQM was again lower that of the wild-type Tar (Fig. 3c), although these receptors seemed to show normal clustering (Supplementary Fig. 16c).\n\nTo elucidate the mechanism of inversion, we carried out MD simulations to compare the conformations of the linker region and the MH bundle for the AA (ligand-free) and AH (ligand-bound) states of the wild-type and mutant receptors. Simulations were performed for the receptor fragment containing a part of the periplasmic domain, the transmembrane helices, the HAMP domain, and the MH bundle. The models were embedded in DPPC or POPC bilayer and simulated at 323 or 300 K, respectively. The results showed that the conformations assumed by the wild-type and mutant Tar were different between the AA and AH states (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Figs. 17, 18). Notably, in all of these mutants the third position of the linker (position e of the first a–g heptad of MH1) was changed to proline, which generates a kink in the α-helix. Ligand binding resulted in helix bending around the linker region (Fig. 3e). As previous studies indicated that structural dynamics of the cytoplasmic domains might play an important role in modulating kinase activity19,20,21,22,23,24, we analyzed the RMSF of the HAMP domain and MH bundle in both AA and AH states of the wild-type and mutant Tar receptors. The simulations using DPPC (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 17, Supplementary Table 4) or POPC lipids (Supplementary Fig. 18, Supplementary Tables 4, 5) gave similar results. In the AH state of the wild-type Tar, the RMSF of AS1 in the HAMP dimer decreases, whereas that of AS2 and the four-helix MH bundle increases compared with the AA state. This is consistent with the previously proposed destabilization of the modification region in the kinase-off state20,23,24. In contrast, although the AH states of TarHAMP_GVPQM, TarHAMP_TLPRY, and TarHAMP_VVPAY showed a decreased RMSF of AS1 and AS2 of the HAMP domain, the dynamics of the MH bundle decreased in these cases.\n\nWe further analyzed the distance distributions of the residues on the HAMP domain and the MH bundle in the AA and AH states of wild-type Tar and TarHAMP_GVPQM (Supplementary Fig. 19a). For the HAMP domain of TarHAMP_GVPQM and AS1 of wild-type Tar, the distance distributions of the residue pairs become slightly narrower in the AH state than the AA state (Supplementary Fig. 19b, d), consistent with its lower RMSF upon ligand binding. In contrast, the distance distributions of the residue pairs on the MH1 and MH2 change oppositely in wild-type Tar and TarHAMP_GVPQM, with wild-type Tar having wider distributions in the AH state while TarHAMP_GVPQM having narrower distributions (Supplementary Fig. 19c, e), in line with the higher RMSF data.\n\nWe propose that the linker region in the wild type and mutants propagate opposite conformational effects on the dynamics of the MH bundle, which might explain the response inversion in the mutants. The piston force from the periplasmic domain and TM2 upon ligand binding changes the AS1–AS1′ interface the dynamics of the HAMP domain. In the wild-type Tar, there is a support force from the linker region and MH1 to balance this piston force, which leads to the destabilization of MH1. In the mutant receptors, however, R269P substitution in the linker region generates a helix kink that breaks the balance between piston force and support force and results in stabilization of the MH bundle.\n\nTo test whether the R269P substitution alone is sufficient for signal inversion, we introduced this mutation into the wild-type Tar. However, TarR269P showed no response to MeAsp, possibly because P269 (position e) and G271 (position g) together broke the MH1 helix thus fully inhibiting receptor activity. We hypothesized that additional substitution of G271 at the helix–helix interface to hydrophobic residues Y or M, as observed in all three functional mutants (267GVPQM271, 267TLPRY271, and 267VVPAY271) might enhance helical packing and restore activity. Indeed, FRET measurements showed that TarR269PG271Y and TarR269PG271M recovered the ability to sense MeAsp as a repellent (Supplementary Fig. 20). This suggests that, besides the kink introduced by R269P, the inverted response also requires hydrophobic substitutions at G271 that stabilize helical packing.\n\nMapping sensory determinants for environmental stimuli\n\nMany bacterial chemotaxis receptors and sensory histidine kinases are able to respond to a variety of very different environmental factors, which are unlikely to be sensed by the periplasmic sensory domains. In most cases the mechanisms and even the respective sensory regions of receptors remain unclear. We hypothesize that mutants with an inverted response can be used to map the sensory elements of receptors that are responsible for detection of these stimuli. According to positions of the inversion sequences, Tar can be subdivided into three parts (Fig. 1a): (I) TM1, the periplasmic domain and a part of TM2; (II) the HAMP domain and its junction with TM2; and (III) the region below the HAMP domain. Assuming that conformational changes in the receptor that are elicited by all stimuli are similar, inverted response to a particular stimulus for both TarTM2+2I and TarHAMP_GVPQM indicates that this stimulus is detected by the region I. If only TarHAMP_GVPQM but not TarTM2+2I response is inverted, the stimulus is likely to be detected by the region II, and if no inversion is observed the response must be mediated by the region III.\n\nAs the control for this approach, we confirmed which sensory region is responsible for the detection of the external pH. Tar is known to mediate an attractant response to low pH and a repellent response to high pH, primarily through the periplasmic domain31,38. Consistent with this mode of sensing by region I, cells expressing TarTM2+2I or TarHAMP_GVPQM as a sole receptor both showed an inverted response to pH (Fig. 4a).\n\nWe next mapped sensing regions for a number of other stimuli. Divalent cations Ni2+ and Co2+ are established repellents for E. coli Tar29, but the mechanisms of their sensing remain elusive. While it was initially suggested that Ni2+ is sensed by the periplasmic domain of Tar via the periplasmic nickel-binding protein63, this mode of sensing was challenged by a subsequent study64. We observed that the response of TarTM2+2I to Ni2+ was similar to the wild-type Tar whereas the response of TarHAMP_GVPQM was inverted (Fig. 4b). This suggests that Ni2+ is detected by the region II, most likely by the HAMP domain, and not by the periplasmic domain. This could be further supported by the analysis of the Tar mutant that completely lacks the periplasmic domain (Tar°-T303I)65, which still showed a repellent response to Ni2+ (Supplementary Fig. 21).\n\nWe also investigated the sensing of aromatic compounds toluene and o-xylene, which are attractants for Tar (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 22a). Both TarTM2+2I and TarHAMP_GVPQM produced attractant responses to toluene and o-xylene (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 22a), suggesting that the main sensing determinant for these compounds resides within the region below the HAMP domain. Nevertheless, the response of TarHAMP_GVPQM was weaker than the wild-type Tar, indicating that other receptor segment(s), such as TM helices30 might also be involved in detecting these compounds.\n\nE. coli cells further show repellent responses to osmotic stress, which apparently enables them to avoid regions of high osmolarity36,37. Because all of the wild-type and mutant receptors showed repellent responses to non-ionic osmolytes betaine, sucrose, and l-proline (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 22b, c), we concluded that osmotic stress is primarily sensed by the region below the HAMP domain. In contrast, for the ionic osmolyte NaCl the wild-type Tar showed an attractant response in the tested range of concentrations, whereas both of the mutants produced repellent responses (Fig. 5a–c). These results suggest that Tar-mediated sensing of NaCl primarily occurs via the periplasmic domain and is thus different from the general osmotic response. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we performed MD simulations on the structure of the Tar periplasmic domain at 50 mM NaCl. The systems remain stable during simulations as indicated by low Cα RMSD values (Supplementary Fig. 23a). We subsequently performed the backbone-RMSD clustering for the conformations of final 800 ns with a cutoff of 2.0 Å and compared the structures of the two mostly populated clusters, 60.4% at 0 mM NaCl and 75.8% at 50 mM NaCl. This comparison shows that NaCl induces a distinct conformation of the periplasmic domain that includes a 3.8 Å inward sliding of the α4 helix relative to the α1 helix, as well as relative rotation of the two monomers for 25.5o (Fig. 5d). These two modes of the conformational change are in line with the rearrangement triggered by binding of aspartate5,6. We further hypothesized that other salt ions might elicit similar effects on the periplasmic domain of Tar. Consistently, the wild-type Tar showed an attractant response to KCl, while both mutants mediated the repellent response (Supplementary Fig. 22d).\n\nDespite bacterial chemotaxis pathway being one of the most conserved and best studied signaling systems in bacteria, many aspects of stimulus sensing and signal transduction through bacterial chemoreceptors remain enigmatic. In this study, we report that mutations in specific regions of E. coli chemoreceptor Tar can invert its response to ligands, illustrating striking plasticity of bacterial sensors. These results suggest that under selection bacterial sensors can easily change not only their ligand specificity but also the sign of their response. Furthermore, the obtained response-inverting mutations enabled us to better understand the mechanism of signal transmission through chemoreceptors and to map sensory determinants for unconventional chemotactic stimuli.\n\nFor conventional ligands that bind to the sensory domains of chemoreceptors, signal transmission is known to occur through conformational changes in individual receptor domains. Nevertheless, these conformational signals are very subtle and elucidating their transmission between domains remains a challenge. This is particularly true for the input and output signaling of the HAMP domain that has a central role in signal transmission in chemotaxis receptors, as well as in a wider class of bacterial sensory histidine kinases9,10,42,66,67. The mode of signaling by unconventional physico-chemical stimuli is even less clear. These stimuli are unlikely to all directly affect the sensory domain, and for most of them neither the sensory mode nor the mechanism of signaling have been established.\n\nMutagenesis has been previously extensively used to investigate the function of bacterial chemoreceptors, and multiple mutations in different receptor regions are known to have either activating or inhibitory effects on receptor activity13,14,15,16,23,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48. For example, a previous study showed that insertion or deletion of one residue in TM2 or the control cable of Tsr resulted in kinase-off or kinase-on output shifts14. Similar shifts were observed upon repositioning the Trp209/Tyr210 pair in TM2 of Tar47. However, none of these previously described mutations inverted the response to canonical chemical ligands. And although several mutations that invert responses to unconventional stimuli49, such as phenol30, temperature50,51, oxygen52, or cytoplasmic pH32,53, have been described, the molecular mechanism of signaling by these non-canonical stimuli has never been elucidated, and therefore the interpretation of the observed response inversion remained unclear. Moreover, these previously reported mutations did not invert the canonical ligand response, thus failing to provide mechanistic insights into receptor signaling.\n\nHere, we show that the response of bacterial receptor Tar to the canonical amino-acid attractants can be inverted by perturbing the sequences above or below the HAMP domain. Because signaling by canonical stimuli is much better understood, we propose molecular mechanisms explaining these inversions and thereby provide deeper insights into signaling through the native receptors. The mechanisms of the observed inversions could be explained by MD simulations, providing insights into signal transmission through the HAMP domain. For the response inversion by mutations above HAMP, our analysis suggests that TM2 extension further increases the bending angle of the TM2 helix. This in turn decreases the helicity of the TM2–AS1 junction region 211GIRRMLLT218 and elicits an outward shift of the control cable (GIRRM; part of this junction region) and AS1 helix of HAMP. Our explanation is consistent with the previous model suggesting that the rigidity change of the junction between the TM helices and the HAMP domain is crucial for the modulation of transmembrane signaling12,13,14,15,16. Our results also demonstrate that the region connecting AS2 and MH1 is crucial for the signal output of Tar HAMP domain. Mutations in this linker region apparently invert the dynamic changes in the MH bundle structure that are induced upon ligand binding, stabilizing the MH bundle rather than increasing its dynamics as for the wild-type receptor20,22,23,24. In these mutant receptors, the kink breaks the balance between the piston force and the support force from the linker and MH1, leading to decreased dynamics of the MH bundle. We show that substitutions R269P and G271Y or G271M in the mutated linker are sufficient for eliciting this opposite response, with R269P producing a kink in the helix and G271Y or G271M likely enhancing helical packing to stabilize receptor activity.\n\nOur results are thus consistent with the view that receptor domain segments have different dynamics in the kinase-on and kinase-off signaling states19,20,21,22,23,24 and provide experimental evidence to support these models20,23,24. Overall, ligand binding to the wild-type Tar generates the piston force from the periplasmic domain, which results in bending of TM212, reduces fluctuations of the HAMP domain and increases dynamics of the MH bundle20,22,23,24 (Fig. 2d). Importantly, our analysis enables several further refinements of this model of signal transmission. It suggests that, for the wild-type Tar, TM2 sliding induced by ligand binding promotes interactions of the junction residues, particularly of R213 and R214, with the membrane. Along with sliding of the control cable and AS1, these changes stabilize helical conformation of the junction residues and AS1 of the HAMP domain. In contrast, the dynamics of AS2 rather increases, possibly propagating this change to the MH bundle. Notably, similar conformation changes are observed for both the ligand-occupied and ligand-free monomers, suggesting the involvement of the latter in signaling. The proposed involvement of protein–lipid interactions in receptor signaling is consistent with signaling effects of mutations in I214 and K215 of Tsr, which are likely to affect electrostatic interactions of the control cable with lipids15.\n\nAs a side observation, we found that in both cases the inverted response was apparently less cooperative compared with attractant response mediated by the wild-type Tar. Although this finding requires further investigation, at least in case of TarTM2+2I lower cooperativity seems to be consistent with less efficient receptor clustering, which might weaken cooperative interactions between receptors. The effect of mutations in the linker region after HAMP on cooperativity of receptor interactions appears to be more subtle, since TarHAMP_GVPQM form clusters that similar in size to those of the wild-type Tar.\n\nBesides insights into receptor signaling, we used inversion mutants to determine Tar regions responsible for detection of unconventional tactic stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 24). Detection of Ni2+, and presumably of other divalent cations, is apparently mediated by the receptor region that includes HAMP domain and its junction with TM2. This contradicts to the earlier model of Ni2+ sensing through interactions between the periplasmic sensory domain of Tar and the nickel-binding protein NikA63, but it agrees with the subsequent study64 showing that the NikA, NikB, and NikC in the nickel uptake system are not necessary for Ni2+ detection. Our results suggest that Ni2+ acts intracellularly, being transported into the cell either by the NikABC or by other transport systems68.\n\nSensing of aromatic compounds is apparently mediated by both TM helices and the region below the HAMP domain. Although the involvement of the TM helices in phenol sensing was shown before30, our results suggest that the region below the Tar HAMP domain plays a dominant role in the detection of aromatic compounds.\n\nFinally, the response to hyperosmotic shock elicited by non-ionic osmolytes is mediated by the region below the HAMP domain. This is apparently consistent with the previously reported osmolarity-induced relative movement of Tar dimers within the trimer structure, which occurs around the cytoplasmic tip of receptors36. Nevertheless, osmolarity might also induce conformational changes in the region below the HAMP as suggested for the osmosensor EnvZ69. In contrast to this general osmotic response, sensing mechanism for ionic osmolytes NaCl and KCl involved the periplasmic domain of Tar. We propose that monovalent salts screen the coulombic interactions at the surface of Tar periplasmic domain, thereby reshaping its conformation and dynamics (Supplementary Fig. 23b). Similar mechanism of salt ion detection might be used by the two-component histidine kinases70."
