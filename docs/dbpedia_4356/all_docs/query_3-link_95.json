        "text": "Greetings, comm scholars! I'm co-hosting an NCA preconference, and would like to warmly welcome anyone who will be at the conference to attend! Details below! As you are making plans to register for the upcoming NCA convention, we would like to invite you to an exciting preconference, entitled, “Bridging Freedom and Inquiry: Taking on Tough Issues in the Classroom and Beyond,” held at NCA on Wednesday, November 15 from 8 a.m. - noon. This preconference will bring together scholar-teachers who are doing the pragmatic work of bridging divides in their classrooms and communities, using a public discourse and deliberation model. It features opportunities to network with other scholars in this space, as well as to hear practical suggestions on how to bring this into classrooms and universities in teaching, debate, and community-engaged work. This pre-conference uses a panel discussion format, with topics including best practices in teaching across differences, how to incorporate community-engaged learning in our classes to bridge differences, and using grants to fund debate and civil discourse work on college and university campuses. This preconference is for people interested in the public dialogue, discourse, debate, and deliberation space in one way or another, who would like to intentionally network with others and build their capacities to bring bridge-building work into their classrooms and communities, for the purposes of tackling wicked problems in our society today which impact freedom. For more information, contact April Chatham-Carpenter (axchathamca@ualr.edu), Justin Eckstein (ecksteja@plu.edu), or Jennifer Keohane (jkeohane@ubalt.edu).\n\nCRY PIETERMARITZBURG THE BELOVED CITY. In recent years, Pietermaritzburg has been facing a significant decline in the quality of higher education. This deterioration can be attributed to a number of factors, including a lack of funding, outdated facilities, and a shortage of qualified teachers. One of the main issues plaguing higher education in Pietermaritzburg is the lack of adequate funding. Many educational institutions in the city are struggling to provide students with the resources they need to succeed, leading to overcrowded classrooms, outdated textbooks, and limited access to technology. Without proper funding, these institutions are unable to attract and retain qualified teachers, further exacerbating the problem. Additionally, many higher education institutions in Pietermar ill-equipped to provide students with a modern and stimulating learning environment. This not only hinders the academic experience of students but also affects their overall well-being and success. Furthermore, there is a shortage of qualified teachers in Pietermaritzburg, particularly in specialized fields such as science and technology. This scarcity of skilled educators not only limits the academic opportunities available to students but also hampers the overall quality of education in the city. In order to address these issues and combat the decay of higher education in Pietermaritzburg, urgent action must be taken. This includes increasing funding for educational institutions, renovating and modernizing facilities, and recruiting and retaining qualified teachers. It is essential that the government, educational authorities, and the community come together to prioritize higher education and invest in the future of Pietermaritzburg's students. By taking proactive measures to improve the quality of higher education in Pietermaritzburg, we can ensure that students have access to the resources, opportunities, and support they need to succeed. It is crucial that we address the decay of higher education in the city and work towards building a strong and vibrant educational system for the benefit of all.\n\nThe Zinn Education Project is revolutionizing history education in classrooms across the country. Their approach introduces students to a more accurate, complex, and engaging understanding of history than is found in traditional textbooks and curricula. With over 150,000 registered users and growing by 10,000 new registrants each year, the Zinn Education Project is a leading resource for teachers and educators. By taking a more engaging and honest look at the past, we can equip students with the analytical tools to make sense of and improve the world today.

Outside the library, we asked students a simple, yet thought-provoking question: “If you did not have to buy a textbook, what would you do with the money?” The responses were as diverse as our student body, each one shedding light on the varied lives and dreams of our students. From the essentials like food and rent to the heartwarming—like buying a sweet treat or saving for a future without financial stress—each answer painted a picture of the hopes and day-to-day realities our students face. This event was not just about gathering responses; it was a powerful reminder of why we advocate for Open Educational Resources. Each dollar saved on textbooks is a step toward a more equitable and accessible education. It’s about real-life impacts, about futures made brighter, and opportunities made possible. As we continue to champion the use of OER, we are reminded that at the heart of our work are the students and their stories, their challenges, and their triumphs. Let’s keep pushing forward, making education open and accessible to all, one resource at a time.

The university received 76,792 applications from all 50 states and 74 countries.\" My reflexive response was: that's a very institution-centered statistic. I can see why a school might promote that information. And, what I really want to know is: What does that mean for their students? And also their employees? Is SDSU commensurately \"setting new records\" in their experiences of safety, access, dignity, belonging and thriving? How is their promise to \"dare you to learn more, do more, be more\" (SDSU) going for the entirety of their community? I'm not knocking the university. I'm wondering (once again) what is really worth bragging about in the \"competitive schools\" competition. What do students and families need and deserve to know? Because in addition to time and money, education is an investment of trust.\n\nOur scholarship application is open until March 5. Over 200 scholarship opportunities are available for high school seniors and college students. How it works: • Applicants complete an eligibility quiz after creating an account in the scholarship portal. • The system then matches students to available scholarships. • If an applicant is matched to one or more scholarships, the complete application becomes available to them (applicants only need to fill it out once).
