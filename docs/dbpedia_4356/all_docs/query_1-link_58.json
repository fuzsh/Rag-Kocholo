        "text": "Update 08/16/2021: We retested the Sony X900H with the latest firmware, PKG6.0466.0059NAA. Contrast with local dimming has improved a bit, but it's not a noticeable difference.\n\nThe Sony X900H has an excellent native contrast ratio, although contrast may vary between units. It's higher than that of the Sony X950H, as it doesn't have Sony's 'X-Wide Angle' layer, which has the side effect of lowering the contrast ratio. The local dimming improves the contrast a bit, but not by much. That said, blacks still look deep, making it a great choice for dark room viewing. If you want a TV with an even better contrast ratio, check out the Hisense H9G.\n\nUpdate 11/01/2021: We rechecked the peak brightness after updating to the final VRR firmware, v6.1534, but nothing changed.\n\nUpdate 10/26/2021: We retested the peak brightness with the latest firmware, in the new 'Enhanced format (VRR)' mode. It's less bright overall than our posted brightness measurements because local dimming isn't available in this mode. We compare the brightness in the VRR mode with the brightness in 'Enhanced format' with local dimming disabled and found that there's no difference at all.\n\nUpdate 08/16/2021: We retested the Sony X900H with the latest firmware, PKG6.0466.0059NAA. SDR peak brightness decreased a tiny bit overall, but it's not a noticeable difference. On the other hand, the TV isn't dimming small highlights as much anymore, so the 2% windows are closer to other scenes.\n\nThis TV has great SDR peak brightness. It's more than enough to fight glare, so you shouldn't have any issues using the TV in a well-lit room. However, the brightness varies depending on the content, and small areas are dimmer, as seen in the 2% and 10% windows.\n\nWe measured the SDR peak brightness after calibration, using the 'Custom' Picture Mode. Local Dimming and X-tended Dynamic Range were both set to 'High'.\n\nIf you want an even brighter image and don't mind losing accuracy, we reached 638 cd/m² in the 25% window using the 'Vivid' Picture Mode, with Local Dimming and X-tended Dynamic Range on 'High', and Contrast at max.\n\nUpdate 08/16/2021: We retested the Sony X900H with the latest firmware, PKG6.0466.0059NAA. Someone had reported that the latest firmware broke auto local dimming and that it was now necessary to toggle the local dimming feature between 'High' and 'Medium' for it to work properly again. We tried to reproduce this issue, but our unit doesn't appear to be affected by this bug.\n\nUpdate 06/22/2021: We've added two new videos demonstrating the local dimming feature with real content.\n\nThe full-array local dimming is good. It looks very similar to the Sony X950H, but with less blooming. There's a bit of dimming, though, and some small details are crushed in darker areas. It's good at making highlights in the background pop without being overly distracting; however, it doesn't handle highlights in the foreground as well as the X950H.\n\nUpdate 10/26/2021: We retested the peak brightness with the latest firmware, in the new 'Enhanced format (VRR)' mode. It's less bright overall than our posted brightness measurements because local dimming isn't available in this mode. We compare the brightness in the VRR mode with the brightness in 'Enhanced format' with local dimming disabled and found that there's no difference at all.\n\nUpdate 08/16/2021: We retested the Sony X900H with the latest firmware, PKG6.0466.0059NAA. With the latest firmware, the TV is slightly dimmer in HDR, but it's not a noticeable difference.\n\nUpdate 06/22/2021: We've retested the HDR peak brightness with Local Dimming set to 'Medium'. In that mode, the 2% and 10% windows aren't dimmed by the algorithms, resulting in a more consistent peak brightness across different content, but some scenes aren't as bright.\n\nUpdate 03/12/2021: We've retested the HDR peak brightness with the latest firmware (version PKG6.0414.0055NAA). There's a slight drop in the real scene brightness, from 556 cd/m² to 526 cd/m². Overall, the 2% windows are a bit dimmer, while all the other windows are slightly brighter. The ABL result increased from 0.050 to 0.053. The score has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe HDR brightness is adequate. It gets bright enough to deliver a fairly good HDR experience, especially if you're watching in a dark to moderately lit room, but it doesn't look as punchy in a bright room setting. The overall brightness of scenes is good, as the EOTF follows the target almost perfectly but rolls off toward the TV's peak brightness, meaning that highlights can't appear quite as bright as intended. The brightness also varies a lot depending on the content with Local Dimming set to 'High'. If this variation bothers you, setting it to 'Medium' results in less variation in peak brightness, but also a slightly dimmer image in some cases. If you want a TV with exceptionally high brightness in HDR, check out the Samsung QN85A QLED.\n\nWe measured the HDR brightness before calibration, using the 'Custom' Picture Mode, 'Expert 2' Color Temperature, and with Local Dimming and X-tended Dynamic Range set to 'High'.\n\nIf you find HDR content too dim, you can make it brighter by using the 'Vivid' Picture Mode, with Local Dimming, X-tended Dynamic Range, and Advanced Contrast Enhancer all set to 'High'. These settings result in a much brighter image, as you can see in this EOTF.\n\nUpdate 08/16/2021: We retested the Sony X900H with the latest firmware, PKG6.0466.0059NAA. With the latest firmware the TV is slightly dimmer in HDR, but it's not a noticeable difference.\n\nUpdate 03/12/2021: We've retested the HDR brightness in Game Mode with the latest firmware (version PKG6.0414.0055NAA). The real scene brightness dropped from 688 cd/m² to 669 cd/m². All windows are slightly dimmer but shouldn't be noticeable. The most notable changes are in the 2% peak and sustained windows, both losing roughly 50 cd/m². The ABL result increased from 0.030 to 0.035. The score has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn 'Game' mode, HDR is somewhat brighter. This is especially noticeable in real scenes. As with 'Game' mode turned off, the brightness varies quite a bit depending on the content.\n\nWe measured 'Game' mode HDR brightness after calibration, using the 'Game' Picture Mode with Local Dimming and X-tended Dynamic Range set to 'High' and the Color Temperature set to 'Expert 1'. All extra settings were turned off.\n\nUpdate 03/04/2022: Sony released an update to include full VRR support with firmware PKG6.1576.0180NAA. However, we couldn't get proper VRR input lag readings because the TV kept crashing. We experienced the same issue with some other TVs like the Sony X90J, and we're looking into it. We also removed the VRR input lag results from past tests since those are now incorrect.\n\nUpdate 10/19/2021: We retested the input lag without VRR after the latest update. We found that the input lag didn't change at all with the latest update, and our new measurements are within the margin of error of the test, so we didn't change anything in our review.\n\nUpdate 10/08/2021: The Sony X900H received VRR support after an update to firmware PKG6.1288.0155NAA. We measured the VRR input lag with our Radeon RX580 PC, but since we don't normally measure the input lag with that PC, we didn't include those results. Also, those results are incorrect as of the latest firmware update.\n\nThis TV has a remarkably low input lag. It's low as long as you're in 'Game' mode, and it's the lowest with 4k @ 120Hz games. PC users can be in either 'Game' or 'Graphics' mode to get the lowest latency. Input lag remains low even when playing at 4k @ 60Hz + 10-bit HDR, but it increases significantly if motion interpolation is enabled, so it isn't recommended.\n\nUpdate 10/08/2021: The latest firmware PKG6.1288.0155NAA that adds VRR support doesn't change the blurry image with a 4k @ 120Hz signal.\n\nUpdate 08/16/2021: We retested the Sony X900H with the latest firmware, PKG6.0466.0059NAA. Unfortunately, the blur issue with a 4k @ 120Hz signal still hasn't been resolved. We also did a side-by-side comparison with the Sony X950H, as we had received reports that the X900H is blurrier than the X950H, even with regular content. The X950H looks a bit better due to its higher peak brightness and better colors, but image clarity and blurriness is the same.\n\nUpdate 06/22/2021: We retested 4k @ 120Hz support, and unfortunately, the issue hasn't been fixed yet.\n\nUpdate 02/15/2021: We previously indicated that 1440p @ 60Hz is supported natively, it is not. It only works through a forced resolution. We've also retested 1440p @ 120Hz, and it still doesn't work. 1080p @ 120Hz works and is supported natively.\n\nUpdate 11/26/2020: We updated the TV to firmware version PKG6.0414.0055NAA and checked to see if it fixed the issues with chroma 4:4:4 at 4k @ 120Hz. Text looks a bit better, but it's still blurry, as seen in this photo.\n\nUpdate 10/27/2020: We updated the TV to the latest firmware (version 6.0384) and retested it with an HDMI 2.1 source.\n\nUpdate 09/30/2020: We've retested the X900H's ability to display proper chroma 4:4:4 with the latest firmware, as we've received reports that it functions in all picture modes. Unfortunately, the results haven't changed. Chroma 4:4:4 is only possible in 'Graphics' or 'Game' mode.\n\nThe Sony X900H supports most common resolutions, except for 1440p @ 120Hz. It properly displays 4k @ 120Hz and doesn't skip frames. Chroma 4:4:4 is supported at all resolutions, and only requires that you be in 'Game' or 'Graphics' mode. However, text looks a bit blurry with chroma 4:4:4 at 4k @ 120Hz, as you can see in this photo. For full-bandwidth signals like 4k @ 60 + 10-bit HDR, set HDMI Signal Format to 'Enhanced Format' for the input in use.\n\nUpdate 03/04/2022: After a firmware update (version PKG6.1576.0180NAA) the Sony X900H now has Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) support. It automatically switches into Game Mode when you launch a game from a compatible device like the Xbox, and there are no extra settings required.\n\nUpdate 01/28/2022: Some users have reported seeing stutter in some content after updating their TV to Android 10. We tried to reproduce the issue but didn't notice any stutter on our unit.\n\nUpdate 11/09/2021: We changed the 'PS5, Variable Refresh Rate' result, as the TV now supports VRR, but the PS5 doesn't.\n\nUpdate 11/01/2021: We retested the X900H with the latest firmware update, v6.1534. There are still issues with 4k @ 120Hz gaming, and it's still halving the resolution in games, displaying at 3840 x 1080.\n\nUpdate 10/08/2021: The Sony X900H received VRR support after an update to firmware PKG6.1288.0155NAA. We noticed with Destiny 2 on the Xbox Series X that the resolution is reduced to 3840x1080 and the 'Open Director' box flashes between white and gray, which you can see here.\n\nThe Sony X900H has two HDMI 2.1 ports (ports 3 and 4), and it supports most, but not all, resolutions for new gaming consoles. When setting the HDMI Signal Format to 'Enhanced Format', it can support a 4k @ 120Hz signal but not Dolby Vision, as you can see here. However, when it's set to 'Enhanced Format (Dolby Vision)', it can't support a 4k @ 120Hz signal, as seen here. This, unfortunately, means that users have to choose between 4k @ 120Hz or Dolby Vision when using the Xbox Series X. For VRR, you have to set it to 'Enhanced Format (VRR)', and that disables the local dimming and Dolby Vision."
