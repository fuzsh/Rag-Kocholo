        "text": "Twitter is art. Twitter is writing. It does feel a little bit corny to say that, but at the same time, it would be foolish to deny the literary merit of tweets and to deny the historical significance Twitter will have. When I say Twitter, I mean Twitter, but I also mean the internet as a whole. I think that memes, for example, are strange time capsules. Memes are a sort of thing that only make sense when you understand the technology surrounding it and when you understand the culture of the internet at the time.\n\nWhen you take, something like a âRick Roll,â for example, itâs the kind of thing that will be taught in history classes to show the genesis of internet humor. A âRick Rollâ is obviously something that relies on the technology of clicking on a link, something that might not exist in 200 years.\n\nThere will definitely be a section of history books, not only to teach people what memes are, but to teach people how the technology at certain points lead to specific types of humor.\n\nItâs fascinating to me. Itâs important to me now even though I might not be alive in the time itâs an important historical artifact. But there are people who are saying things like, âTwitter is stupidâ or âWriting on the internet doesnât matter,â and theyâre going to feel very foolish some day. Itâs the future of humor, of writing, of everything.\n\nWhen Iâm live-tweeting an awards show, itâs because itâs fun, and itâs entertaining, and Iâm sharing my worldview, about the Oscars, for example. Itâs a lot of fun, and also I do think that my commentary, during those moments on Twitter, is well in line with how I see the world, and the kinds of things that I want to write about.\n\nI often think of Twitter, especially when Iâm thinking through current events, like a sandbox. Iâm kicking around ideas. There are definitely times when I do latch onto something and think, this deserves the kind of thought and depth that writing an essay could bring about.\n\nMy tweets come from the ego, the part of my brain or self that wants to be witty or funny or prove something, whereas with the poems I try not to use my conscious mind at all. With the poems, in the initial draft, there is nothing to prove, nowhere to get, no one to impress, just a channel inside that is hopefully clear language and subconscious knowing.\n\nSome of the best tweets get born that way, tooâlike they are born whole almost. I would say, though, that my poems get better with edits, whereas if you have to edit a tweet a lot it might not be a good tweet. When I edit a poem I ask âis this true?â and what I mean by true is not truth in a reality sense, but true as in does it feel right in my bones. Whereas with a tweet Iâm mostly asking is this good or funny. And if you ask that too much about anything it turns to shit.\n\nAn example of this is the difference between my @melissabroder feed and my @sosadtoday feed. The @melissabroder feed has always been edited, honed, and carefully crafted, and thus has way less followers than the So Sad Today feed, which began out of desperation and sometimes still is me just shitting out whatever I need to get out so it doesnât eat me.\n\nEvery time I learn something, I want to share it. Itâs my hope that in these times when people are looking for an understanding of why black lives matter, my work can help illustrate those things or help find spaces for beauty that are still filled with revolution. I hope that my work can in some way be a resource to them.\n\nI think that a lot of times, especially to people who are really present in the media, at the end of the day, youâre just a medium for what people are trying to say. Thatâs something thatâs as old as academia, where people are looking to be able to illustrate what their points are. We want to be able to read ourselves into these kinds of spaces and into these worlds that can help us to better understand what weâre contesting with.\n\nI think a lot about those things. Thinking about Facebook, where itâs a space that you can find out so many things. You can find out about Hurricane Matthew. You can find out about your Auntâs cookout next weekend. When youâre adding to this noise, in what ways are you improving upon silence? Thatâs something that Iâm always thinking through. I want the information that Iâm sharing to be able to do that. To be able to help people in their pursuit of something else.\n\nI feel like so much of contemporary loneliness in motion is this compulsion to share my web browser. Itâs like thereâs a way of aesthetically stating your browser, which is kind of where you move and how you look and what you see. Even just breaking it up into close shots and long shots, and like whatâs at the center. Itâs not about a golden mean, but itâs a signature as poetryâwhich is how I see and how I move and what stops meâand putting them together.\n\nEven in the vocabulary of Instagram, itâs just like, Iâve talked to people and theyâve laughed because young people have sat them down and told them what you shouldnât do. You know, we donât like these different filters, or whatever those are called, those arenât cool, and all that. I think that one of the cardinal rules is not to repeat a picture or repeat too close of a picture, or kind of keep trying to fix something or do somethingâ¦ It seems to me, itâs very musical. The slight variations, just on top of each other, are really interesting. I suppose itâs a way in which, if anything it feels like film to me, or video, because itâs really documenting nextness in this way. Itâs like, okay, now Iâm looking at it over this way.\n\nI found my voice through [Twitter]. Writing things in that restricted way was helpful, and I needed the encouragement to keep doing things based on the reception to it, because I think if Iâm alone in my room doing something, Iâll have no confidence that I should keep doing it. The back and forth between people is helpful.\n\nAlso, you can use Twitter for so many different things. I feel like maybe no two people use it the exact same way, because it can just be a conversation tool or it can just be non-sequiturs or something. Itâs kind of weird if weâre all shouting into the void and then seeing what attracts us to it. Thereâs other art stuff going on, too. Twitter is writing, but Twitter is also performance.\n\nIâm sort of a slightly embarrassingly enthusiastic social media person. I do Facebook. I have yet not gone the route of Instagram. Everyone keeps telling me, âItâs so much better than Facebook.â I somehow feel afraid, like Iâll never do anything again if I also use Instagram. I do sort of participate a lotâfor better or worseâin Facebook. Thereâs a certain category of image where itâs a kind of, âHey, hey, check this out, look what I saw.â I like using it that way. I like walking around and looking at the world, sometimes, with the idea that maybe thereâs something interesting here I could show to other people."
