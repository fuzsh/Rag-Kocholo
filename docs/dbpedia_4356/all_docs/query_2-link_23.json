        "text": "Epik High just released their first mixtape. In previous interviews, you've defined 'Pump' as a mixtape because, sonically, it’s very different from your studio albums and EPs. Why are you exploring this format 20 years into your career?\n\nWe felt kind of lost as we were leading up to our 20th year, which is ironic. On the surface, it looked like we had it all together, because we were doing our 20th tour and we had a movie [showcasing the group's 20th anniversary concert] out, but it's a scary number. It was scary when we hit 10, but hitting 20 — when a human hits 20, they're like, I'm an adult. Now, what do I do with my life?\n\nEpik High turned 20, and we [started wondering], What would we do if we were back to our first year and no one knew us? If we didn't know how to make music the way we know now? What kind of album would we create? We [thought], A mixtape, just free flowing and doing whatever we want, and breaking all the rules. Not music rules, but Epik High rules, because we've developed some of them over the years.\n\nWhat are some of these rules?\n\nWell, it's not necessarily rules. What I said to my members was, \"I think our biggest weakness is that we know too much.\" Over the years, we've gained so much experience and our skill level has gone up to the point where we know exactly how to craft a hit, and we know exactly what kind of songs will speak to what kind of audience. Knowing all of this typically would be a good thing, but for us, it's our disadvantage — because we will immediately go to those decisions, instead of exploring something new or risky.\n\nIt took [the members] a while to accept that. I had to drag it in, and then they came to me, \"You know, you're right. We do feel like that.\" And I was like, \"Let's write these things down that we don't want to do.\" All of them were things that we usually do, like, let's not just go to a famous feature, because that's such an easy thing that we know how to do. Let's not make big melody hooks that we know will work. And then we just went with that, which in itself is very risky, because we didn't know how the audience would react.\n\nJudging by our streaming, usually hit songs spike like crazy in the first couple days, and then fall off because a lot of people only listen once or twice. And then there are songs where less people listen because it's not commercial or it's not catered to everyone, but they listen over and over again, and that's what we're seeing with this album. It’s a very interesting phenomenon, and something that actually makes us very happy.\n\nI noticed that 'Pump' is quite different from the music that you have been doing lately. You need to spend some time with it to understand what's going on and to find its magic. It's not an album of easy hooks, like you said. Do you think you guys were revisiting the Epik High of 20 years ago, or that you were rewriting that era, doing what you wish you had done?\n\nThere's both. We wanted to create like we were rookies again; we didn't want to think about the path too much, although we did make references to certain songs from early albums because it's fun.\n\nBut we don't ever regret things, or wish we could go back to a certain era, because there was a lot of good stuff, but there were also a lot of terrible things that we don't want to ever revisit. So, we're more focused from today on.\n\nThinking back to 20 years ago, what are some of the changes you witnessed, either in music or in yourselves?\n\nLiterally, the entire world has changed. When we started, people were still dropping cassette tapes. Now, cassette tapes are something fun that artists do as a collector's item. We didn't have streaming. We didn't have social media. I'm sure some people who are reading this interview can't even fathom, but we did live in a world without any of that.\n\nThe downside is that it was very, very difficult to get our music to audiences. To get one listener was almost an impossibility, so we were forced to go out and perform. Back then, hip-hop was not accepted at all [in Korea]; it was just not a genre that people liked. And because we didn't have any stages to go on, we performed at a zoo, we performed at clubs with 13 people in there, we just had to do that because that was the only way to get our music out.\n\nAnd the huge upside, though, is that, because we developed our skills performing to an audience that was either confused by us or didn't like us, we had to make them understand the music and make them vibe. We developed a very specific skill set that is really hard to attain. I think that's why, 20 years later, we're still able to headline festivals and to do these big tours, and people have a really good time at our shows.\n\nNowadays, a lot of times musicians will feel satisfied with their streaming numbers, or with their social numbers. They might not feel that it's necessary to get out there and to perform in front of 10 people. I'm sure none of them will perform at a zoo.\n\nThis mixtape’s single, \"Antihero,\" approaches people’s perceptions and misconceptions about Epik High. When someone gets famous, they are either idolized or demonized — we see that a lot in the Korean music scene, specifically in K-pop, where fans even call artists \"idols.\" What do you think about that? Is this related to the message you wanted to convey?\n\n\"Antihero\" is less \"I'm an antihero,\" and more \"You see me as an antihero,\" where you may like me, but you don't fully like me. There's always some flaw, or some weakness that you're looking for, and that's sort of the stance of the song.\n\nEpik High has had a lot of anti[fans] over the last 20 years, and at the same time, though, we provide a lot of entertainment to these antis. They would literally have nothing to do if we didn't provide them with something to get angry about, or to harass us about. In a way, we're sort of these twisted heroes to them as well.\n\nThat's why, if you look at the music video, [there is] a hero part, and then a villain part, because those are the two sides of an antihero. But that's also the two sides of any star, or any person, actually. Some people choose to see the good parts of you, but some people will choose to ignore all of that and see just the parts that seem dark. I think that the song is touching on all of that.\n\nThe lyrics to \"K-drama\" use Korean TV dramas' vocabulary — like \"dramatic reversal\" and \"OST\" — to talk about real life. What do you think about the image that South Korea displays in these shows?\n\nI'm a huge fan of K-dramas. It's just very fun, and always has you at the edge of your seat. I don't know if people outside [of Korea] think that, if you come to Korea, you're immediately stepping into a K-drama. A lot of people get deluded and think, like, all Korean men are perfect.\n\nBut just the same, a lot of people outside the U.S. think that, if you go to L.A., it's going to be like a Dr. Dre music video, or a Snoop Dogg music video. And that's just one depiction of one part of a very complicated, beautiful, and complex place.\n\nThere's always truth in fiction, so you will discover elements of K-dramas when you come here. But if life was a K-drama… A lot of K-dramas are really tragic, the plot twists. Although I will say, I've been embroiled in the TaJinYo scandal [Editor's note: Starting in 2010, Tablo was victim to a smear campaign that accused him of faking his bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford University. The school came forward multiple times to confirm his accomplishments, and eight TaJinYo members were sentenced to prison.], and there were actual directors, even overseas, who wanted to turn it into a drama or a movie. So, I guess I did live a life that's like a K-drama, true with heroes, villains, and victims. It was crazy.\n\nWhy hasn't it become a series or a movie yet? Do you plan on making something like that?\n\nWell, it's a very tricky story to tell. It's a timeless story, because it's about the internet, and it's about hatred and idolization, but it's not an easy thing to turn into a fictional story.\n\nDo you feel like it would be weird to see your life depicted on screen? Or do you already feel that, since a good part of your life has been public?\n\nI am very good at keeping myself and my family detached from our public persona. But I don't mean to say that Tablo or Epik High are not an actual version of ourselves. It's just that Epik High is different in that, when we come off stage, we don't experience that huge drop off.\n\nOn stage we have a very specific goal, which is to make the audience have a great time. Nothing else is on our minds. And because of that, when we come off stage, there's no high to come off. We finish the concert and we're home 20 minutes later, doing dishes and vacuuming. I’m not kidding. Epik High is notorious for not having after parties, and we will just come home after a huge stadium concert and watch YouTube with our kids, or take out the garbage.\n\nIt keeps your ego in check.\n\nYeah. When we first became famous, we probably did have a period where we thought, This is about us. But very quickly we realized that, if this was about us, we were not going to have longevity, because that fades. But if you keep it about the audience, as long as they're there, you know that it won't change.\n\nSince you talked about longevity, what are the most important things for a band to stay together and to still be relevant and innovative after 20 years?\n\nOver the last couple of years, a lot of huge brands in Korea have invited me to speak to their companies. I think they look at us as a case study on the longevity of a brand, or how to stay connected for a long time. And I've declined, because speaking is not something I wanted to do, but it made me think, What is it?\n\nFirst of all, you have to have no \"yes men\" around you.This is a very simple, but also extremely difficult thing to do, because people need an affirming environment, and that's not a bad thing, right? It's a very thin line between a supportive person, and a person who just tells you what you want to hear.\n\nEpik High has absolutely zero of those people in our rooms. In interviews and stuff, the three of us almost seem like we hate each other. We're never not fighting, and we're doing it on screen, so imagine what we're like off screen.\n\nAlso, our staff [is] a very dedicated group of people, and we're all very, very honest — from our engineer to our art guy. Most of the people that we work with have been working with us for a long time, and none of them are scared to tell me, \"Tablo, that outfit ain't it. Your hair ain't it.\" Or, \"Tablo, your voice sucks right now.\" Or, \"these lyrics are terrible.\" We're all very honest, and I think that's key to longevity.\n\nAn artist's career is sometimes destroyed by outside forces. But I tend to believe that, in a lot of cases, artists' careers get destroyed by the artists themselves. It's not their fault, but when you're constantly told what you want to hear, instead of what you need to hear, it's impossible to grow. If the people around you actually care for you, they will never prevent you from experiencing things, which is necessary for growth.\n\nLooking ahead to the next 20 years, is there anything you want to do that you haven’t done yet?\n\nWe actually had this conversation lately: Wouldn’t it be really cool if there was a Korean hip-hop group who stayed together until they were grandpas? And we’re on stage with gray hair, but we’re still super good. And people will see us on TV or so, and will be like, \"Those grandpas are dope!\"\n\nA lot of young artists tell us that they started music because they listened to Epik High. But later on, after they become big stars, they tell us that now we inspire them because we show that it’s possible to do [this] for over 10 years, 20 years, and still do what you want to do.\n\nWe never had that. We didn’t have anyone to look up to, any [groups] who stayed together and [kept making] music at the same level that they always did, so we were really scared. Hopefully, us becoming dope grandpas in the future will show people that it’s okay. It’s okay to just keep doing it.\n\nBreakdancing has been a huge part of hip-hop culture for many, many years — and it’s long overdue to be recognized on a global scale like the Olympics. What are your thoughts about seeing this movement that you started getting this kind of recognition?\n\nThis whole culture that we call hip-hop started back in the 1960s. With the Civil Rights movement, community organizers, and government officials all debating about something so basic: the right to all be seen as equal and free. It was a traumatic time, you know? But we had music that was so relevant to the whole movement.\n\nBy the time the late 1970s and early 1980s came along, everyone was trying to escape all of the traumatic racism that was still going on. And music became our escapism. That’s where breaking came in: everyone was just trying to mimic James Brown on the dance floor. You’d see one guy doing his thing, and everyone would form a circle around him. Pretty soon, someone else would join the circle and challenge him. And before you knew it, there was a whole competition — and whoever won became the most popular in the club.\n\nThat kicked it all off. To see it recognized on such a large scale just reaffirms, to me, that this hip-hop culture of ours was made with love.\n\nThere were breaking films such as 1985's 'Krush Groove' that were completely revolutionary in that it gave everyone — not just those within the culture — a view into the world of hip-hop, and suggested what it could become. At the time, you were becoming the first commercially successful rapper and one of the pillars of what would become the New York sound. Were you aware that you were on the precipice of something revolutionary?\n\nI don’t want to call myself a visionary or anything like that, but I did know that this was something special, because I saw how quickly it spread around different boroughs in New York City.\n\nFrom Harlem and the Bronx, and then over into Queens, Brooklyn, and even New Jersey, it was amazing to see everyone just gel around that whole hip-hop scene. As I said before, we all needed that escapism, you know? Forget about your troubles, just come and dance.\n\nWith me being in Harlem, right down the block from the Cotton Club and that whole mindset around dancing becoming America’s pastime — just coming from that era, where we had to go to the parties to have a good time — [I knew] that we had created something that would outlast us.\n\nNot only did you attend divinity school, but you are also an ordained minister. How do you bridge those two aspects of your life and how do you reconcile being a rapper with being a minister?\n\nThat is such a great question, and thank you for asking.\n\nIt’s very simple: God is the Creator. God created hip-hop. We have to start with that, right here. God gave us the talent to perform the music; he gave us the passion to want to spread the music to the masses. He gave us the desire to say, \"Hey, come take a look at me! God has blessed me with this — can you do this?\"\n\nNow, when you talk about the actual elements of hip-hop — that is, the emcees, and the message that we bring — it’s crucial to understand that we are commanded by God to uplift our community and to show them love. This is the actual essence of hip-hop: peace, unity, love, and just having safe fun.\n\nMy mission is to believe in the faith that God is real, and God is in the miracle business. I have seen nothing but miracles for the last 45-50 years in this thing called hip-hop. And it’s important to understand that God is in the mix, and we are all blessed by the common denominator known as hip-hop. It should be our mission to get that back.\n\nAs for what’s going on today — the nature of the lyrics, the gangster rap, and all the violence — it didn’t really start out that way, did it? And if we can inspire the future for our youth, then we’ve made a difference. Because the future is in their hands, and we need to inspire them.\n\nBut, as a counterpoint, times are different today. And what these men and women are speaking to may not necessarily be destructive — rather, there could be a case made where they’re merely being street poets, and telling the reality of life as they see it. What advice would you give to those people who are telling a different story than the one you told all those years ago?\n\nWe are called to be these soldiers, warriors, servants, and communicators. So I understand their reality is different, you know? The world is upside down. The kids out there are just telling it like it is. They’re communicating their reality.\n\nBut I think that we should not only communicate how it is, but how it could be. And how it should be.\n\nThink of how different it would be if they also gave some inspiration for a positive future: \"Yeah, we goin’ through this, we goin’ through that, but with God, you can overcome all of that. With prayer, you can have miracles, and blessings, come down.\"\n\nEven if you just understand the nature of the reality that we’re going into right now — things like mass incarceration, the drug epidemic, gun violence, the war profiteering off of Black and brown bodies — it falls upon the shoulders of the elders of this community, this hip-hop movement, to inspire and communicate the possibilities to the younger up-and-comers.\n\nThey need to understand that they are the product of royalty. They are the descendants of kings and queens of Africa. They need to honor themselves and honor their ancestors, accordingly.\n\nThe album’s 25 tracks include forays into Afrobeats, soca, R&B, country and, of course, hardcore dancehall. On the album’s first single, \"2085 Tea,\" Spice ingeniously adopts the persona of a gossip-mongering granny who’s spilling the \"tea\" on herself. \"I’ve gone through trauma, heartache, pain, betrayal, so I didn’t want this gossip to be about other people’s lives,\" Spice tells GRAMMY.com of the song. \"I wanted it to be about my experiences.\"\n\nBorn Grace Hamilton in Spanish Town, Jamaica, Spice came from very humble beginnings. She grew up singing in the church and developed a love of performing while still in school.\n\nIn 2000 Spice made her first appearance on a major Jamaican stage show, Sting, when Ninja Man, one of the greatest, most feared opponents in verbal clashes, spotted Spice’s talent. When Spice was handed the mic, she did not disappoint. A few years later, dancehall star Baby Cham introduced Spice to his mentor, maverick producer Dave Kelly, for whom she recorded her first hit single, 2005’s \"Fight Over Man.\"\n\nIn 2009, Spice’s career accelerated with her feature on Vybz Kartel’s \"Ramping Shop.\" With its catchy refrain, raunchy patois lyrics, and the undeniable chemistry between Spice and Kartel, \"Ramping Shop\" became one of the biggest and most controversial dancehall hits. Jamaica’s Broadcasting Commission issued a directive to halt its play on the island’s airwaves but the ban only increased its popularity; \"Ramping Shop\" spent 15 weeks on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart.\n\nSince then, Spice’s has released numerous explicit singles accompanied by imaginative videos including \"Sheet,\" \"Needle Eye\" and \"So Mi Like it\" — each of which can be viewed as liberated expressions of female sexuality or \"slackness\" (vulgarity). However, Spice’s music also addresses topical issues such as sexism, on \"Think Like A Man\", and corrupt policing on \"Po-Po\" inspired by Black Lives Matter and featuring an impressive verse from Spice’s teenaged son Nicho. Among Spice’s most impactful songs is \"Black Hypocrisy,\" prompted by a derisive social media comment about Spice’s dark complexion.\n\nSpice has survived poverty, homelessness and in 2022, a health scare that almost brought her remarkable journey to a premature end. Ahead of the release of Mirror 25, which she calls \"a raw open diary of her triumphs and tribulations\" Spice reflected on her life, career, and spilled a little more tea, with GRAMMY.com.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nCongratulations on your 25th anniversary. Does it feel like 25 years have passed since you started?\n\nIt feels like it was just yesterday; I can vividly remember each year as I struggled to make it to this point. I remember in 1999, when Bounty Killer handed me the microphone in my community so I could go onstage and showcase my talent; in 2000 when I did my first major performance on Sting in Jamaica and Ninja Man helped me make a name for myself by calling me onstage; when Baby Cham helped me to get my first hit song, \"Fight Over Man,\" by introducing me to Dave Kelly.\n\nBut I’m always reminded of my struggle, it has not been an overnight success. I’ve been through a lot to get to this point; to become a GRAMMY nominated queen of dancehall was not a walk in the park.\n\nTell me about the songs, the topics that you’ve written about on 'Mirror 25'?\n\nAs the queen of dancehall, I want to make sure that I represent the genre as authentically as possible, with that hardcore dancehall sound, so the listener will know that’s a girl from Jamaica. On tracks [such as \"Gangster\" with Chronic Law, featuring Ireland Boss] you can hear the sound system, the bassline, you can almost smell the ackee and saltfish and jerk chicken.\n\nI have a song that could go on the R&B chart. I have a song about what happened in my past relationship [\"Ex Boyfriend\"], which will be very relatable to women because that song asks, why do men do the things that they do to women? They can’t live without us but treat us in a manner that is degrading sometimes.\n\nThere are dancing songs [and] collaborations with Jamaican women; we’re singing about our power as women. My fan base has grown tremendously so there’s an Afrobeats collaboration and we are going into the Indian market. I give all praise to Him after my near-death experience, so there’s a little bit of worship, too.\n\nTowards the end of 2022 we heard rumors that you weren’t well and possibly were in a coma. Please explain what happened.\n\nI was in the Dominican Republic, I had breast augmentation. While I was there my hernia erupted and sent my body into a sepsis shock.\n\nI felt like I died because of what I went through. At one point, I had an out of body experience. I saw pictures of the sepsis that had eaten away at my skin; I shared the pictures with my fans. I was literally laying there with an open stomach, without skin. It was a traumatic experience but through the grace of God, somehow, he brought me back to normal.\n\nDid you fear that you wouldn’t be able to resume your career?\n\nOh, absolutely. This happened in November 2022 and for the rest of that year, and throughout 2023, I was in and out of the hospital. The sepsis also affected some of my organs. I did surgery to fix another hernia that they caused when they opened my chest up to save my life. By the grace of God, I completed my final surgery, and the hernia was repaired.\n\nWatching you perform on stage now, you twerk, \"wine up your waist,\"do splits. If we didn’t know what had happened, we would never guess you have been through such an ordeal.\n\nGod is good, I give Him all the praise.\n\nThe first single from 'Mirror 25,' \"2085 Tea\" is so cleverly written and delivered as you get your jabs in about certain people including your children’s father, \"Love and Hip-Hop Atlanta\" castmates and your back up dancer who allegedly had an affair with your now ex-boyfriend. How did the song come together?\n\nIt started when I figured out what I wanted to call my album. When I look in the mirror, I do a lot of self-reflection, thinking about my past, the things I’ve managed to overcome, and I wondered, what will I be doing when I get older? So, the album’s name, Mirror 25 birthed the idea of putting myself in 2085 and talking about what I’ve been through. And if I’m in the future, obviously, I’m going to be an older person, so I started talking in my granny voice and I thought, oh my God, that’s an idea.\n\nI love the way you are styled for your portrayal of a granny in the video: gray wig, pearls, long skirt, and the vintage TV set, the room’s décor looks like a grandmother’s home. Were all of the things we see in the video your idea?\n\nThe ideas are all me, but I have a team of people that execute them. I called my makeup artist, Nosworthy Creations and asked, \"How can I make my face look more wrinkled, like an older person?\" She said \"you can use a prosthetic, they do that in movies.\" So she reached out to someone who works on movie sets and they told her what to put on my face; that process took six hours to apply then dry on my face to make it appear wrinkled.\n\nJD Production and [director] Spex found the old TV and the place that looked like an older person’s home. Empress the Glam did my hair although I’m mad at her because I wanted a little blue in the gray hair because even when I’m old, I’m going to be wearing my blue. [Laughs.] I was so happy with the outcome, but it was a very long process.\n\nBusta Rhymes is featured on the country/dancehall/hip-hop track \"Round Round.\" In June 2023, the BET Awards celebrated hip-hop's 50th and honored Busta; he invited you to perform as part of the tribute segment. What was that experience like?\n\nI was excited to celebrate in that moment, it’s one of my greatest memories with Busta and within that segment with other Caribbean artists, I made sure I represented the Caribbean in a way that’s true to myself. Because it was BET, some people thought that I shouldn’t [dance] in the style that I usually do.\n\nI’m not sure if people understand that before you appear on TV, your song and performance have to be approved. It’s not like Busta called me up from the audience; anything I did on the stage that night was rehearsed, approved. There were mixed reactions to my performance, like oh my God, why did she dance like that? Because that’s the way I dance and as the queen of dancehall, I’m always going to authentically represent dancehall culture.\n\nTell me about recording \"Round Round.\"\n\n\"Round Round\" is a country western dancehall blend. [Jamaican producer] YowLevite, who put the riddim together said, \"There’s too much going on, the riddim sounds like country, it sounds like dancehall.\" I said, \"Give me the riddim, I’ll know what to do with it.\" I stayed true to myself as a dancehall artist, but I sound a little country, too. It’s unique and I thought, who else is that unique to bring the elements of hip-hop, country and dancehall together on one song? Busta was the only person who came to mind.\n\nI recorded my part, sent it to him, and he said \"Boss lady, it’s a big tune\"; that floored me because I didn’t expect that response, he loved the track. Working with Busta, an icon, is humbling to my spirit because he is such a sweetheart, always encouraging, always pushing our Jamaican culture. I’m very honored to collaborate with him on \"Round Round.\" People want to dance to it, it makes people happy and that makes it more fun for me.\n\nHow do you handle criticism like what you received about your dancing on BET, the disparaging comments on social media, even the bashing from other artists?\n\nI call my fans \"besties\" because I make them feel like they are my best friends; my besties say I don’t deal well with criticism, I need to leave certain things alone. But sometimes when these criticisms get too much, I will go live and say, \"Come besties, let’s talk about it.\"\n\nI address many things because if you leave many things, people will believe many things. If someone spreads a rumor about me, or if something comes out that I need to clear up, I will clear it up. It’s been 25 years, like I said, it wasn’t a walk in the park to reach here so I’m not going to sit back and let anybody tarnish my brand.\n\nRead more:The Women Essential To Reggae And Dancehall\n\nHow has dancehall changed in the 25 years you’ve been doing it?\n\nDancehall has evolved drastically: the creative process has changed, and new sounds were born. More people are discovering the genre on a larger scale. More artists, especially females, have a voice now.\n\nTechnology has modernized our releases, whereas in the past, I used to print CDs, walk around and hand them out to taxi and bus drivers to promote my music. Today, I’m on TikTok and Instagram with the touch of a button.\n\nHow have you changed as an artist?\n\nMy fans also know me as an entrepreneur, I’ve been a businesswoman for many years. I have my clothing company, Gracie Noir, which is leisure wear, specializing in track suits for travel. I recently released a book, The Navigational Yearly Planner; I’m trying to help my fans become more organized, more business savvy, learn financial literacy. That has helped me with my record label where I have to write out everything that has to be done when releasing music.\n\nI’ve also grown more spiritually, professionally, mentally. I’m a better person in a better state of mind, I have more knowledge on the business of music. I was stuck in a contract with VP Records for 10 of my 25 years, they didn’t release my album (hence, her debut album’s title, 10). My [2018] Captured mixtape addresses that, because I felt like I was captured.\n\nI’ve learned so much about publishing, releasing music, getting it out to the DSPs. That’s why I’m so excited about Mirror 25 because I’m releasing it on my own label, Spice Official Entertainment."
