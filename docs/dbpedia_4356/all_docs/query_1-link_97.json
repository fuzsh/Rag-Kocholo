        "text": "Having an issue with all of my standard def DVDs, particularly older TV shows and concerts playing in \"stretch mode\".\n\nThe flat screen TV is a Samsung LN 46B530 from 2009. My AV receiver is a Yamaha HTR 6290B.\n\nThe following are the players.\n\nSony Blu-ray Disc / DVD Player - BDP-S360\n\nSony Blu-ray Disc / DVD Player / SACD Player - BPD-S770\n\nSony Blu-ray Disc / DVD Player / SACD Player - BPD-S580\n\nPioneer Elite DVD-V / DVD-A /SACD Player - DV-46AV\n\nI can't find anything in the Samsung on-screen menu to change the aspect ratio. On one of the Sony players I found the aspect ratio option. I changed it from 16.9 to 4.3. That did nothing.\n\nTwo examples of DVDs playing in the \"stretch screen mode\" are:\n\nDavid Bowie - VH1 Storytellers - Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n\nThe Larry Sanders Show - Complete Series - Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n\nAny ideas? Thanks.\n\nThere will definitely be an aspect ratio option on your TV. Might be called \"picture size\" or something. Might even be a dedicated button on the remote for it.\n\nHowever, if you're using a device that upscales to 1080i/p then it won't help because that can only be 16:9, so it's up to your upscaling player to maintain the aspect ratio whilst upscaling. The player should have options for this, usually \"keep aspect ratio\" or \"normal\" instead of \"stretch\" or \"fill\".\n\nThere's a subcode setting in the DVD's authoring process that's supposed to set the aspect ratio depending on the screen shape being used. Some discs are poorly authored and it defaults to the wrong position, requiring that you manually go in and fix it. Crap happens.\n\nI have seen discs where the movie is in the correct aspect ratio, but then when you watch the extra materials, it defaults to widescreen and fattenizes everything. Looks horrible. I hate when this happens.\n\nTurns out it wasn't the TV setting. Didn't matter whether the Samsung was set to Screen Fit <> Move or 16:9. The standard def DVDs were still stretching to fit the 16:9 screen. So I decided to go back into the Sony Blu-ray player menu, where I'd been several times before.\n\nWent to Settings / Screen Settings / Screen Format\n\nThe player was on the Original option, which I guess is the default. I selected the other option, Fixed Aspect Ratio.\n\nSoon as I returned to the Bowie DVD, it was playing in 4:3 format. Then I tested the Larry Sanders DVDs and they are playing correctly as well. Thanks again for your assistance.\n\nYeah, I agree with that. Too many manufacturers think it's a good idea to fill the screen as a default, no matter what the source material, and as a result, too much stuff gets fattenized. I've seen 16x9 shows that look slightly fat to my eye, particularly on Samsung sets. I don't know who's responsible, whether it's the cable company or the set or the channel, but somethin' ain't right.\n\nThe other big problem with this is it can take you half a day just to try to figure out if it's the player, the disk or the TV causing the issue. There needs to be some sort of standard where the player is simply relaying the info to the TV then the settings on the TV control the image. That way you don't need to setup every box individuality. I have 5 different box hooked up to my TV it's a nightmare.\n\nI haven't had that issue yet on the Samsung unit.\n\nAfter I changed the screen setting on the Sony Blu-ray BDP-770 player to Fixed Aspect Ratio and tested the Bowie and Larry Sanders discs I put the Zeppelin O2 concert Blu-ray disc in. It played perfect. The correct screen size appeared. Next I'm going to try some \"wide-screen / letter-boxed\" DVD movies and concerts to see how they look now. Ones that previously had black on the top and bottom of our old Panasonic 4:3 27 inch TV such as Cream - Royal Albert Hall DVD set and Talking Heads - Stop Making Sense completely filled the Samsung screen the last time I played them through the Sony Blu-ray players.\n\nTotal crap. I was pretty sure I'd find the answer here quickly, and I did.\n\nAnd what's with the phrase Fixed Aspect Ratio. When I first saw it, I fixated on Fixed. My thought was if I selected that function then it would lock all the various discs to the same screen size. Turns out it was the opposite.\n\nI of course feel you pain. That day and half took me over 3 years.\n\nNow I will be changing the other 3 players, no wait, 4 players. I also have an OPPO DV-970HD all formats player (except Blu-ray) attached to my \"analogue\" system in another room.\n\nIs this term, \"Fixed Aspect Ratio\", used in all DVD and Blu-ray Players, or will I be looking for a different term in the OPPO and Pioneer Elite menus?\n\nIt's been happening with my cousins TV, it drives me nuts he has this huge plasma that most people can only dream about but totally ignores the fact that it looks like crap because nothing displays correctly.\n\nWhen i first made the HD switch over I spent about 3 days playing with settings and then figured out that I had just by chance gotten a set of disks that look terrible.\n\nIt means the aspect ratio is kept the same (or \"fixed\") during scaling.\n\nIt'll usually be something like that but can also be \"original\" or \"normal\", etc.\n\nWow. I have a Phillips TV, and there is a button on the remote called \"A. Ratio\" that easily changes the aspect ratio on the TV. I have a Sony Blu-Ray player, but I never have to mess with any screen settings in that. That player, and my cable box all go through my Marantz receiver which upscales anything that needs to be, so regular DVDs look great, and the player (due to being connected by HDMI) picks the best video and audio features automatically as it relates to my set up. There will be no stretched pictures on the TV in my house. It is forbidden!\n\nIt's a pet peeve of mine when people do the stretch with HD sets. A lot of restaurants and bars do it, and it drives me crazy! I have to look at something else. It gives new meaning to \"The camera adds a few extra pounds\"!!\n\nMy local gym does it for some reason -- adding letterbox borders to all the off-air pictures, which still makes people too fat. I have no idea why they think this is a good idea. I just ignore it and concentrate on my workout and whatever I'm listening to on my iPod.\n\nIgnoring it is the only way it doesn't make me want to fix it. I see that and am always so close to tracking down the remote and changing it to the correct setting.\n\nI'd like to see the end of 4:3 safe graphics. The BBC and ITV still do it for all of their sports broadcasts and it's really annoying to see scoreboards hovering near the centre of the image. Digital switchover was completed last year so there's nobody who cannot watch the full 16:9 broadcasts now (those with 4:3 TVs can set their digiboxes to letterbox). What's even more stupid is they even do it on their HD channels, which are obviously 16:9 only!\n\nI can understand it for source graphics (which get sent to multiple countries' broadcasters, some of which may not be 16:9 yet) but for broadcasters in exclusively digital countries to do it is absurd.\n\nNaaaa, I don't see TV graphics getting away from 4x3 safe for at least another couple of years in America. If there were two separate feeds (HD and SD), we could do it, but few networks have that luxury any more. They are tending to move their \"bug\" channel IDs off to the side for 16x9 safe action, and I think that's the best we can hope for for now."
