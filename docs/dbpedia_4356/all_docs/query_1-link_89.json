Major artists have fought legal battles over hit songs while others settle out of court.\n\nHere are 35 examples of hits songs that were at the center of accusations of plagiarism or lawsuits.\n\nAnjelica Oswald contributed reporting to an earlier version of this story.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.
