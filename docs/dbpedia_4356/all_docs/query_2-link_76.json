        "text": "\"I was absolutely baffled that he would lie about something so stupid. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.\"\n\nLadies, I think we can collectively agree that we've all been lied to before by a man. Obviously, any sort of lie from anyone sucks, but it sucks especially when it's an outlandish one that comes from a partner, spouse, or even someone you're hooking up with.\n\nHere's one of mine: a guy I met on a dating app stood me up and then told me later it was because his dog died the night before.\n\nCurious to hear some of these lies, I asked the BuzzFeed Community: what is the wildest lie, or most the ridiculous, a guy has ever told you? And how did you find out he wasn't telling the truth? Here's what you said!\n\n1. \"I was dating a guy who lived about an hour away so we didn’t see each other on a daily basis. I thought we had a great connection and was head over heels for this guy. One day on his Snapchat story there’s a video of him driving and the camera pans to a girl in the passenger seat. I ask him upfront who she is and he tells me it’s his cousin.\"\n\n\"Fast forward a week or so and I was at a Jonas Brothers concert. I went to Snapchat to take a video but accidentally swiped to the stories where I saw a picture of him and his 'cousin' kissing him on the cheek. Blocked him right then and there and went back to enjoying the Jonas Brothers.\"\n\n—liannerun8\n\n2. \"I spent my birthday with my boyfriend at the movies and I ended up paying for everything. It was hard to hide my disappointment and he became angry saying he had bought me an engagement ring which is why he didn't have money and that I was being selfish and ungrateful. He proposed two months later and I found out his mom bought the ring and she never saw a PENNY from him. I ended up breaking up with him for worse but damn. Gaslighting at its finest.\"\n\n3. \"My ex used to catfish me constantly. He would generate fake numbers to text me to ask questions about my relationship. It was so cringy, I always knew it was him and I would call him out for it every time. He would deny, deny, deny. The worst was YEARS after we broke up he started messaging me on Facebook pretending to be a friend of his that I had met way back when. I caught on pretty quickly that it was him.\"\n\n\"To make it worse, he was married at this time and telling me (as someone else) that he would leave his wife to be with me if I asked him to. WOW. I was still friends with his sister, I didn't even say anything, I just showed her the texts and she told me 'Don't worry about it, I will take care of it. He will never text you again.'\"\n\n—shelle1584\n\n4. \"When I pulled county records that showed he married a girl two years into our relationship and called him barely able to utter a word, his answer was, 'It is not me.' He simply was not aware of what info is available online.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 51\n\n5. \"My best friend dated this guy who was a pathological liar. The best story I remember is that he bragged about how much money he had and that he was saving for a house or something but my friend would pay for EVERYTHING. She was a single mom. She paid for all meals and dates. She suspected that he was lying about not having money so one day she talked him into taking her out to lunch just to see if he would do it and he went along with it even stopping by the bank and coming out of the bank with a money envelope.\"\n\n6. \"I had a C-section and I was staying with my parents for a few days after my daughter was born so they could help me take care of my newborn. My partner, on the other hand, was in our condominium in the city because he was working. He told me not to call him from 10 p.m. onwards because he was too sleepy and had to go to work early. The next day I checked my email and saw a Grab car receipt going to a bar. He used my Grab account to book a ride for his late-night shenanigans.\"\n\n7. \"About a year ago I was dating a man from Nepal. He seemed super nice and I liked dating someone from a different culture because he had a different perspective on life from me. One day, on a date, he told me his visa was denied and that he was going to be deported in a little over a month. It had only been a couple of months since we started dating, but I was extremely upset about it because someone as great as him shouldn’t have to go through something so unfair.\"\n\n\"Over a month later, I found out he lied about being deported because a friend of mine who was still following him on Instagram saw him post a picture with a new woman, still in the same country as me. I confronted him about it and he said he lied to me because he wanted to end things in a way that 'wouldn’t hurt my feelings.' In retrospect, he was either looking for a green card marriage or was just trying to save face. Either way, it was a selfish and hurtful thing to do.\"\n\n—itsyagirl36\n\n8. \"I was texting a stranger-turned-friend for over a year and started to grow fond of him. I decided that we should finally meet in person and have a date. Two days before the date, he admitted he lied about his name and said that he was no stranger but that we were acquaintances in real life. He refused to tell me who he was so I blocked him. Now I'm distrustful of my male acquaintances in case they were him all along.\"\n\n9. \"A guy who my friend brought to a party told me that his girlfriend had recently died of cancer. He showed me pictures, cried, and told me in depth about his grieving process, I gave him my whole evening and really felt for him. A few days later, I was told that it wasn't true, his girlfriend had just broken up with him a few months ago.\"\n\n\"And it had been a completely typical, fairly straightforward breakup. I was really angry and felt kind of violated. The next time I met the dude, he was surprised that I asked him to not sit at the table where I was sitting and told him to never get near me again. He said that it had just been a joke and that I was crazy. Luckily my friend gave him up after that.\"\n\n—hellefh\n\n10. \"When I met my now ex-husband, I was determined to not be dumped, having just gotten out of a bad relationship. While we were dating, we lived about five hours away from each other and would drive back and forth and have video calls and emails when we were apart. This guy seemed adventurous and outgoing and ready to try anything.\"\n\n11. \"I had an ex ghost me after two months of constant contact. I then received a random text from him that he had 'witnessed something bad' during his trip home and he was forced into the witness protection program. 🙄 A week later I saw his car three blocks away. He was shacked up with a friend of a friend.\"\n\n—generalbowen\n\n12. \"When I was in college, I met a nice guy who had just joined my class mid-semester. He explained he had been studying to become a Catholic priest and after several years, he decided he didn't want that life anymore, so returned to his hometown to get a degree. We eventually ended up dating. A couple of months later, after being apart during spring break, something felt off and I asked him about it. He confessed he wanted to go back to his studies to become a priest since he was feeling 'the call of God' and couldn't ignore it.\"\n\n\"Being dumb, young, and raised a Catholic, I totally thought I would go to hell if I tried to hold him up, so I told him to follow his calling, and I broke up with him. Lo and behold, two weeks later, while I was scrolling through Facebook, I saw a new post from him, saying HE WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP and he even tagged the new girlfriend. The 'call from God' was ANOTHER GIRL. I am married now and over it, but still, THE AUDACITY to blame GOD. I have won contests with this story.\"\n\n—Darcy, 29\n\n13. \"Hearing 'I love you' after barely having any contact.\"\n\n—gwenvee\n\n14. \"I was at an outside bar in LA and this guy who looked to be in his 40s, and was shorter than me, came up and told me he was a professional basketball player. I laughed thinking it was a joke but he was really trying to say he was in the NBA. He asked if he could buy me a drink and I said 'I’m not sleeping with you' and he suddenly lost interest.\"\n\n—beccaloni\n\n15. \"After cheating on me with his friend, he tried to tell me the scratches on his back were from our cat. I know what cat scratches look like. When I didn't believe him, he changed his story to say that he lied because he was embarrassed that he was running drunk and shirtless down the alley and tripped. And that's obviously why there were scratches on his back. 🙄\"\n\n16. \"I was dating this guy from an app and our first date was amazing. We planned a second one to a haunted forest. I spent $60 on nonrefundable tickets. Well, the night before he told me he wasn’t feeling well. I asked if he wanted to reschedule and he said he should “hopefully be feeling better by tomorrow.\" The next day he posts a screenshot of a four-mile run on his Instagram story. I ask him how he was feeling, and he said 'Still super under the weather. Gotta bail.' I texted back: 'Yeah, I bet that four-mile run didn’t help.' Blocked. Boy bye. ✌🏼\"\n\n—user28746368947725\n\n17. \"Money went missing from my bank account. When I called the bank and found out it had been withdrawn from our local bank with my debit card, I questioned my boyfriend. He told me he didn't steal from me, and that he had a sleepwalking disorder where he does things he doesn't remember.\"\n\n18. \"He was folding laundry and tossed a shirt at me. It was light blue with ruffles and it was an XS. I only wear neutral colors and at the time I was a size L. He spent two hours trying to convince me it was mine, saying he had seen me in it before and that I wore it on a specific date. I pulled up pictures of the date to show him I had worn a black blouse.\"\n\n\"He literally tried to convince me it was the same shirt. Soon enough I found an overnight parking pass in his car to the complex of his ex-girlfriend. He had been with her the whole time.\"\n\n—user28746368947725\n\n19. \"My first and worst kiss once told me he wanted to go out one night while we were at work, so I got all dressed up and waited by the door for him to pick me up. He confirmed plans mid-day after our shift, so when 6 p.m. rolled around and he wasn’t there, I texted him. No response whatsoever. It turns out he had completely forgotten and was taking his 30-year-old girlfriend for a drive instead. We were 20. I had no idea he was sleeping with someone else when he stole my first kiss.\"\n\n—Whitney, 24\n\n20. \"This was in high school but literally the one boy I dated in my life broke up with me because his 'mom told him to' and 'didn’t approve of our relationship.' I was on good terms with her. I, trying to be a respectful 15-year-old, tried apologizing to her for anything I might have done wrong or to offend her and she was so lost. She said she loved me and apologized for how her son acted toward me. Turns out he was just too chickenshit to break up with me normally. Thanks for that trauma, dude!\"\n\n21. \"When I was in college, a guy convinced me that he served the White House in secret intelligence and had to be gone for a few days to a week or more. Later I found out that he was married!\"\n\n—Anonymous\n\n22. \"I was struggling with endometriosis — surgeries, hospital visits, excruciating pain — when my boyfriend broke up with me. When I asked him why, he reached out a hand and placed it over my pelvic area. He said he cared too much to see me in pain and was worried it would lead to cancer and he just couldn't bear it. I found out later he was hooking up with a 16-year-old at his work and wanted to date her. He was 24.\"\n\n23. \"I was 19 when we first started dating and was a huge One Direction fan. I've been to both of their shows in Seattle and was heartbroken when they announced their break. His sister who was a few years younger was also a huge fan. He told me on one of our first dates that he took his sister to the same concerts I went to, and how it was 'so crazy we didn’t see each other.; Mind you, he was a Tinder match who lived in another state and I was only 14 or 15 at the very first concert, so this should’ve been my first red flag. Fast forward to staying with his family for a week. I asked his sister about her experience at the shows, trying to be friendly and she gave me the ugliest look saying she’s never been like I was an idiot for thinking so.\"\n\n\"I was absolutely baffled that he would lie about something so stupid, I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. And when I called him out on it, he dumped me and left me stranded in Idaho 50 miles from home! Thankfully I met my husband a few months later. He hates lying and is not a fan of One Direction but thinks Harry can 'carry a tune' — so no more worries on my end!\"\n\n—Casey, 24\n\n24. \"He pulled up in front of my house in a car and he said it was his mother’s. We drove around for some time and came back home to find the police in front of my house. He stole his neighbor’s car and drove it from Queens to my home in Nassau County, NY.\"\n\n25. \"I found lingerie in his hamper when I was doing his laundry and he told me it belonged to his sister. Why he thought I’d believe his sister would leave her lingerie at his apartment, I don’t know. Anytime I would find anything that would belong to a female in his apartment (like hair ties) he would say it was his sisters. He didn’t even live with his sister, she lived an hour away with her husband. I’m sure he’s telling whomever he’s with now the same exact thing whenever she finds female belongings in his apartment. Hopefully she’s able to see past the lies.\"\n\n—Anonymous\n\n26. \"My ex and I were on a break. We met up on a night out and he gave me his jacket, his phone was in his pocket, and against my better judgment, I read his messages. He had obviously been hooking up with someone else. When I questioned him, he told me she was a friend who had been diagnosed with HIV and he was supporting her. I felt awful at assuming the worst and told him that it was great what he was doing and if there was anything I could do. We ended up back together, two years later, and after a very acrimonious spilt, I find out that the HIV story was a lie and basically he had been sleeping with a mutual friend.\"\n\n27. \"I was in my freshman year at college trying to make a long-distance relationship work with my boyfriend back home. We agreed he would visit on weekends, which was about a 40-minute train ride to my school. The weekend rolled around, I bought his ticket and he was nowhere to be found. He ignored countless calls and messages the entire weekend. Finally, on Sunday night, I got ahold of him and he said, 'I'm sorry, I was in a bad car accident and I broke my leg.' Of course, my anger flew out of the window and I was very concerned about making sure he was ok. We rescheduled for the following weekend in which this idiot shows up perfectly fine without a broken leg. He had no choice but to admit he lied.\"\n\n—Jas, 30\n\n28. \"My ex-brother-in-law got caught cheating — but told my sister-in-law that she misunderstood the situation. They were only in bed naked and they weren't going to do anything.\"\n\n29. He told me that he was a Navy SEAL and couldn't tell me where he was going, how long he would be gone, or when he would be back. Coming from a Navy family, I didn't think this was odd, but later found out that he wasn't a SEAL, but it was a convenient way for him to keep three or four women rotating at one time. Unfortunately, this was during a time when there was no internet or social media platforms, so he managed to do this pretty often.\n\n—Katie\n\n30. \"He told me he was divorced and shared custody of two young daughters. Three months later he told me that he was still married, living with his wife but supposedly on separate floors of the house and that she was 8.5 months pregnant with a child that may or may not be his.\"\n\n31. \"I was in a long-distance relationship with a guy a few years ago. We were on and off for a number of years and something just felt off about it. There was just always so much drama around him but he always blamed it on other people. I knew he was separated, or so I thought. Found out he and his wife were still living together from, of all people, his girlfriend. This man was leading a triple life and he had no problem lying to me about it for YEARS!\"\n\n—katiel4c495e293\n\n32. My boyfriend of three months told me he missed our date because he fell and hit his head and had amnesia. Claimed he had no idea who I was. It was a pretty ridiculous statement to begin with, made more ridiculous when he tried to say they gave him a full meal in the hospital within hours. I broke up with him that weekend. A year later, I ran into his ex who he shared a house with. She had no idea what I was talking about. I was right: biggest lie after standing someone up ever.\n\n33. \"My ex-boyfriend indirectly told me he was Jewish on our third date. I asked him 'So what’s your mum like?' and he replied 'Oh, you know, a typical Jewish mother.' When I met his family and saw that they were quite clearly Catholic, I asked him why on Earth he had told me they were Jewish. He said, 'Oh because I thought you were Jewish.' I’m not.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 29\n\nHave you ever been told a ridiculous lie by a man? Vent about it in the comments below!\n\nShare This Article"
