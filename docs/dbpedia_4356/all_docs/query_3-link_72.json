        "text": "The Dogg can do dressage, too, with help from Martha Stewart.\n\nSnoop Dogg made an appearance on Saturday at the Dressage team grand prix special at the Chateau de Versailles on Saturday at the 2024 Paris Olympics. His equestrian-inspired look went viral, with photos dominating Instagram feeds and comments praising his outfit.\n\nThe rapper looked the part in a competition-ready black tailcoat featuring six-button fastening over a white polo and matching trousers. He accessorized with brown leather chaps, black Skechers sneakers, from his collaboration with the brand, and gloves by Munich-based label Roeckl. Adding a touch of Americana motifs and a nod to the Olympics’ host city, he wore Givenchy aviators emblazoned with stars as well as a helmet by French brand Shadowmatt. A gold S-shaped brooch completed the look.\n\n“Tunnel walks wit Martha Stewart dressage,” he captioned an Instagram photo alongside Stewart — the friends partnered in 2016 on the cooking series “Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party” on VH1.\n\nOn Friday, Stewart told NBC they collaborated on matching looks.\n\n“Snoop called me and said he knows I know horses, and he’s a little fearful of horses,” Stewart said. Snoop, who was tapped by the network as an Olympics correspondent, responded, “I’m still scared of horses.” “So we’re going to do dressage,” Stewart said."
