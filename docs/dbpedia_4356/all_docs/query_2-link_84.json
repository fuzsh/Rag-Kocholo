[Infographic]\n\nBy now, you must have already chosen a presentation topic idea. But you might still be wondering why your teacher assigned you this task in the first place.\n\nNo, your teacher is not out to get you by assigning a presentation you have to choose the topic for. There are a few reasons why teachers and professors assign presentations this way.\n\nChoosing a presentation topic idea inspires you to look inside themselves to find a topic of interest. Knowing about your interests helps give direction to your future life and career plans.\n\nSelecting topics to present about in school also helps you learn how to do research properly. You get more familiar with the practice of taking notes, creating an outline and prioritizing information.\n\nBrainstorming various topic ideas is also great for improving your creative performance. And finally, getting up on stage and presenting prepares you for public speaking in front of an audience.\n\nHere's a quick infographic to sum it all up.\n\nCreate an infographic of your own!Sign up. It's free.\n\nBelieve it or not, assigning a presentation is one of the best ways to teach a student how to learn on their own. It’s similar to asking a student to write an essay, but a lot more fun!\n\nHow to Pick the Right Presentation Topic\n\nIf you're overwhelmed by all the school presentation ideas above and aren't sure which one is right for your presentation, don't worry. We have tips to help you pick the right topic in no time.\n\nIf after this process you still aren’t sure, just browse through the list above and find a specific presentation subject idea that sparks your interest most.\n\nThe first step to figuring out what your presentation should be about is to ask yourself these questions:\n\nWhat are your hobbies?\n\nWhat type of books do you read?\n\nWhen you play Trivial Pursuit, which topic are you good at?\n\nWhat kind of TV shows do you watch?\n\nWhat would you like to learn more about?\n\nWhat Are Your Hobbies?\n\nIt’s easy to find a presentation topic by looking at your hobbies. The best part of this choice is that you’ll be passionate when presenting it to your peers.\n\nFor example, if you love woodworking, create a presentation about the history of woodworking or a step-by-step look at “How to make a wooden bowl by hand.”\n\nWhat Type of Books Do You Read?\n\nWhen looking for innovative topics for presentation, consider the style of books you’ve been reading lately. Have any of them made an impact on your life?\n\nIf you're having a difficult time coming up with a topic idea, you can create a presentation about a book that you found really special, or about an author you’ve read a few books by.\n\nWhen You Play Trivial Pursuit, Which Topic Are You Good At?\n\nIf you've ever played Trivial Pursuit or attended a Trivia Night, you must have noticed that some topics are easier for you to answer. That is your topic of interest and a great place to look for some ideas.\n\nFor example, if you always know the answer to the questions about classical music, you can create a presentation about your favorite composer.\n\nWhat Kind of TV Shows Do You Watch?\n\nWhat have you been binge-watching lately? Regardless if its Orange is The New Black or a documentary about the Sudanese civil war, you can find an interesting topic to work with.\n\nIt can be about history or current events. You could even do some kind of comparative analysis on how a specific show has affected you or the people who watch it.\n\nWhat Would You Like to Learn More About?\n\nAnother way to find the best topics for presentation is to think of things you want to learn more about. Take the opportunity to learn something new and then share it in your presentation.\n\nPresent the facts of what you learned or turn the presentation into a journal entry of your personal experience using the new information that you just learned.\n\nAdditionally, it’s important to remember that whatever topic you choose, it must also be appropriate.\n\nAs Allan Smith says,\n\nPresentation Tips for Students\n\nOnce you have chosen the perfect presentation topic idea, it’s time to create your presentation. Here are some tips for putting together a great presentation that will get you a good grade.\n\nPresentation Mistakes to Avoid\n\nFirst things first, let’s talk about some presentation no-nos. You want to avoid these mistakes in any presentation you give—from a presentation for a grade in your middle school class all the way up to a business presentation.\n\nKey presentation don’ts are:\n\nDon’t create slides full of text—your presentation is not a 30-page essay. Instead, create slides with just a few bullets and some type of visual to represent your content.\n\nDon’t just read off of your slides—you’ll bore your audience. Practice and rehearse your presentation or create index cards with speaking notes to make your presentation more engaging.\n\nDon’t use a new design, transition, animation, etc., on each slide—you’ll clutter up your design. Choose one single design, color scheme, font pairing, transition style, animation effect, etc., and use it throughout to create a cohesive presentation design.\n\nDon’t present on topics you don’t understand—you’ll sound like you don’t know what you’re talking about. Even if you’re choosing a “new to you” topic, you need to do enough research to have a firm grasp on the information you’re presenting.\n\nDon’t ramble and go over your allotted time—you’ll sound flustered and unorganized. Again, make sure you practice your presentation so that you can smoothly transition from slide to slide and cover all information in the time given.\n\nRegardless of the topic you're presenting, creating drafts shouldn't be a challenge. Utilize Visme's AI writer to generate high-quality content in seconds. Feel free to deploy it as a proofreading tool or an outline creator. Just describe what you want to write about and get content ideas or Power Point presentation topics and the tool will work out the details.\n\nUse Data Visualization in Your Presentation\n\nRegardless of which type of topic you’ve chosen, there’s likely some sort of data or information that would be better presented via visuals rather than written out numbers or text.\n\nMake sure you choose a presentation tool that makes it easy to visualize certain information. For example, Visme allows you to create a number of data visualizations that help make information pop on your slide.\n\nSome examples of data visualizations you can use within your presentation include:\n\nTimelines for historical information\n\nCharts and graphs for numerical data sets\n\nTables for organizing text\n\nMaps for sharing geographic information\n\nFlowcharts and diagrams for organizing information\n\nData widgets for visualizing standalone numbers\n\nAvoid Using Boring Layouts\n\nDon’t let your presentation look like a PowerPoint from the nineties with a blank white background and two columns of boring bullet points. Instead, take advantage of engaging presentation templates and spice up your slides.\n\nFirst, start with a template that’s going to make your information stand out. You can browse a few options that Visme offers below.
