        "text": "Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa\n\nThe comic vet (under a rich overall deal with Warner Bros. TV) punctuates his youth-skewing slate (The CW's Riverdale and Katy Keene and Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) with LGBTQ characters and storylines — including a transition arc on Sabrina, mirroring the life of genderqueer star Lachlan Watson.\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"A movie version of the musical Falsettos.\"\n\nTHE PERSON I THINK DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THEIR ACTIVISM \"My friend Tanya Saracho. She created the show Vida and is always fighting the good fight. And educating people. And challenging them. And advocating for underrepresented voices. She’s a superhero.\"\n\nGreg Berlanti\n\nHaving fought to put the first same-sex kiss between two men on network TV (Dawson's Creek), the megaproducer continues to represent the community in the many shows (he's juggling 19) he has across six platforms. His directorial work on Love, Simon marked the first major studio movie to center on a gay teen romance.\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"We have the kind of representation in big-budget studio films that we do on TV.\"\n\nTHE PERSON I THINK DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THEIR ACTIVISM \"I really believe Billy Eichner and his 'Glam Up the Midterms' made a real difference across the nation in the last election. I was so impressed with his tireless efforts, and we are going to need leaders like him to have success again in the fall.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"LGBTQ spy/action film.\"\n\nCasey Bloys\n\nSince taking the entertainment reins in 2016, Bloys has made it a mission to broaden inclusion efforts with YA hit Euphoria and period drama Gentleman Jack — both of which star queer characters. The out exec recently launched We're Here, a rare unscripted foray in which drag queens visit small towns.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"The 1992 TV movie Doing Time on Maple Drive.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"All members of the LGBTQ community feel represented. We are a wide and varied bunch.\"\n\nSteven Canals\n\nThe writer made history with Pose, which features the largest number of trans actors ever on scripted TV. His and Ryan Murphy's FX drama, renewed for a third season, is widely praised as the bellwether of boosted trans and person-of-color representation on and behind the camera.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Patrik-Ian Polk's Noah's Arc. I hadn't seen black and Latin queer men centered positively on TV until then.\"\n\nMY MENTOR IS \"Neil Landau (Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead), who has been a friend, a counselor and a lifeline since I wrote the first draft of Pose in his TV Drama Pilot workshop at UCLA.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"Every network has at least one series on air created by an LGBTQ person, centering an LGBTQ lead, played by LGBTQ talent.\"\n\nRuPaul Charles\n\nThe ambassador of drag just closed the 12th season of Drag Race on VH1, which has consistently topped Friday cable ratings and launched a host of drag careers. Sure, his foray into scripted TV, AJ and the Queen, fizzled after one season, but in a year that saw three iterations of Drag Race air, the multihyphenate — who has won Emmys four years running for best reality-series host — is clearly not \"fucking it up.\"\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Bugs Bunny outsmart the status quo with a wink and a witty remark.\"\n\nAndy Cohen\n\nAfter more than a decade of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, where he became the first openly gay host in American late night, Bravo's exec turned talent tackles all kinds of media (SiriusXM show Radio Andy, multiple books), while uplifting and advocating for the LGBTQ community.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Norman on The Real World season one.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"As much representation as there is, there are very few big gay love stories. I’d love one.\"\n\nI FELT MOST PROUD TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY LAST YEAR WHEN \"I was riding down Fifth Avenue on the Bravo float at World Pride.\"\n\nLaverne Cox\n\nThe groundbreaking performer followed her seven-season run on Orange Is the New Black (a role that earned her three Emmy nominations, a first for a trans performer) with appearances on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Awkwafina Is Nora From Queens. She'll next appear in Netflix's Inventing Anna and is an executive producer of the Sundance doc Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen, debuting June 19 on Netflix.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Candis Cayne in Dirty Sexy Money in 2007.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"Representations can facilitate changing the material conditions of LGBTQ folks on- and offscreen across the globe.\"\n\nI FELT MOST PROUD TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY LAST YEAR WHEN \"I got to stand beside Aimee Stephens on the steps of the Supreme Court of the United States last October.\"\n\nLee Daniels\n\nOn his Fox drama Empire, the creator infused broadcast TV with a rare portrayal of a queer African American man. On musical follow-up Star, Daniels cast the third openly transgender actor (Amiyah Scott) to play a major trans character in a U.S. TV drama. On the film front, the Precious director is completing his project about queer singer Billie Holiday.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Norman … Is That You? starring Pearl Bailey and Redd Foxx. It was a gay Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Way ahead of its time.\"\n\nMY MENTOR IS \"James Baldwin [drops mic]\"\n\nTHE PERSON I THINK DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THEIR ACTIVISM \"Raymond St. Jacques. He was a talented black, gay working actor who was paving the way for us in the '80s in the streets in Hollywood. He was an activist for the people and was fighting for our rights at a time when it was dangerous until he sadly succumbed to AIDS in 1990. It breaks my heart that people don't know of him.\"\n\nRussell T. Davies\n\nFrom Queer as Folk in 1999 through acclaimed dramas Bob & Rose, A Very English Scandal and 2019's Years and Years, LGBTQ stories have played a prominent role in Davies' award-winning TV projects. He'll double down on queer storytelling with HBO Max's Boys, set to explore the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Billy Crystal in Soap. Suddenly, a clever, funny, kind, hot gay man on TV, that's still rare.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"We get great big hot superheroes, please. Not sweet representations. But great big horny bastards, male and female.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"All of them. Romeo choosing Mercutio. Juliet and the Nurse. West Side Story with the Jets and the Sharks at it like knives. Batman on Superman. Gay it all up! Everything!\"\n\nEllen DeGeneres\n\nSince her landmark coming-out in 1997, DeGeneres has risen to the highest levels in Hollywood. She started her 2020 with the Golden Globes' Carol Burnett Lifetime Achievement Award — and her daytime talk show, credited with endearing much of America to LGBTQ persons, is in its 17th season.

Creator of the NBC sitcom One Big Happy and her own YouTube talk show This Just Out, Feldman recently made her Netflix comedy outright queer, as Dead to Me's sophomore season revealed a lead character to be bisexual.\n\nMY MENTOR IS \"I might be the luckiest little lesbian in the world, because one of my mentors was Ellen DeGeneres. She was my idol when I was growing up, and I quite literally dreamt about working for her one day. That day came in 2005 when I was hired to write for her talk show.

Harris\n\nDuring the 17-week Broadway run of his critical hit Slave Play, A-list audience members included Rihanna, but Harris spearheaded an effort to promote economic diversity in his audience — getting producers to price 10,000 tickets at $39. After co-writing A24 Sundance feature Zola and consulting on HBO's Euphoria, Harris signed a two-year first-look deal with the premium cable network, where he's setting up a drama pilot.\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"One that makes my blood boil with confusion and rage that I wasn't able to come up with it first, something completely unexpected and impolite.\"\n\nTHE PERSON I THINK DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THEIR ACTIVISM \"The 12-year-old black queer child in Texas who goes to school every day looking and speaking however the fuck they want — parents, teachers, friends or loneliness be damned.

Holland provides a massive stage for LGBTQ voices with inclusive shows like Sex Education, Feel Good, Special and Cheer, and the streamer has signed creators such as Janet Mock to overall deals.\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"Hollywood is just one of many places with LGBTQ representation.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"Bound 2.\"\n\nI FELT MOST PROUD TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY LAST YEAR WHEN \"I rode in my 11th AidsLifecycle from S.F. to L.A. to benefit the Los Angeles LGBT Center.\"\n\nNina Jacobson\n\nUnder her prolific banner, the producer has driven film and TV content that embraces a rich tapestry of characters — from FX's Emmy-winning Pose to Warner Bros.' $238.5 million-grossing Crazy Rich Asians.

Lee's sophomore film, period lesbian love story Ammonite, starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, is due out late 2020 from Neon.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"In 1987, I was about 18 and very much not out, living at home in Yorkshire before moving to London. My family were away on holiday, so I had the house to myself. On TV, Channel 4 had a season of late night queer programming and were screening Parting Glances. I stayed up until 12 a.m. to watch it. For the first time I saw representations of everyday queer lives in a way that felt like I might be able to lead a fulfilling life with the person I loved without hiding or being ashamed. I could have a job, friends, a life. It was revelatory.\"\n\nMY MENTOR IS \"I'm not sure I have a mentor, but Mike Leigh is a good friend and a constant source of inspiration.\"\n\nHoward Lee\n\nLee has cultivated one of the most inclusive schedules in all of TV, let alone basic cable. TLC standouts include transgender docuseries I Am Jazz and Lost in Transition, makeover show Dragnificent! and, for the first time, a same-sex couple on the popular 90 Day Fiancé franchise. Lee and the network are both involved in anti-bullying campaign \"Give a Little.\"\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Flower Drum Song, a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical from 1961, on TV.

Levy, who co-created the show with dad Eugene, earned legions of admirers in fans and critics alike for crafting a same-sex love story in a series that was free of homophobia.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"My So-Called Life. Watching Rickie Vasquez, a gay character played by an openly gay actor, Wilson Cruz, certainly felt like the most honest and respectful portrayal of a gay teen I had ever seen.\"\n\nTHE TOP OF MY QUARANTINE BINGE LIST \"Feel Good. My good friend Ally Pankiw directed it. And my fellow Canadian Mae Martin wrote and stars in it.

The exec gave RuPaul's Drag Race a bigger platform, moving it from Logo to VH1, also leading the charge to shift MTV's Movie & TV Awards and VMAs to genderless categories and launching VH1 Trailblazer Honors — an event that recognizes LGBTQ leaders and allies.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Mario Cantone host a TV show in the '80s called Steampipe Alley on a New York City channel.

Bayard fought alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. but was erased from much of history because he was gay. I’d love to see his Selma story be turned into a film.\"\n\nJanet Mock\n\nThe activist and best-selling author made history as part of the creative team of Pose, the series on which she cut her teeth as writer, producer and first-time director. Mock proved she was no one-hit wonder, signing an overall deal in TV and a first-look pact for films with Netflix — where she has since put her talents to work with mentor Ryan Murphy on his rewrite of industry history Hollywood and set out developing a slate of originals highlighting trans characters and people of color.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"My So-Called Life.

The prolific creator, who has two children with photographer husband David Miller, has devoted his career to telling the kinds of queer stories he never saw on TV growing up. From Glee to American Horror Story to Pose, Murphy has succeeded in building his own inclusive content universe — and he's continuing to add to it at Netflix, where he's dropped queer-centric shows like The Politician and Hollywood and has the upcoming movie The Boys in the Band.\n\nJim Parsons\n\nA year after wrapping CBS' The Big Bang Theory, Parsons has leaned into telling LGBTQ stories. On camera, Parsons has appeared in The Boys in the Band and Hollywood. As a producer, his That's Wonderful banner — which he runs with husband Todd Spiewak — was behind the Emmy-winning Netflix shortform dramedy Special.\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"When 'gay actor,' 'gay director,' 'gay writer,' 'gay story,' et cetera, are no longer labels even worth mentioning.\"\n\nTHE PERSON I THINK DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THEIR ACTIVISM \"Larry Kramer. He was the only honest-to-God activist with a capital A I have ever met. You could sense the fire and the mission within him. It was invigorating and a little frightening — well, frightening to this sweet, gay, Southern boy who shies away from confrontation.\"\n\nBen Platt\n\nSince receiving his 2017 Tony for Dear Evan Hansen, Platt has been on a meteoric rise. A starring role in The Politician brought him a Golden Globe nomination, and his debut album (Sing to Me Instead) inspired a Netflix concert special. In addition to speaking, and singing, publicly about his own gay relationships, Platt plays bi on The Politician — accounting for several of the series' many entangled LGBTQ romances.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Chris Colfer playing Kurt on Glee. I was in high school, which was an incredibly formative time to see myself reflected in media.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"There is a healthier variety of queer stories and characters whose queerness is not their defining factor. And when roles are cast across the board based solely on an actor’s ability and how right they are for any given role, regardless of their sexuality or the character’s sexuality.\"\n\nBilly Porter\n\nThe Pose star became the first openly gay black man to win the dramatic lead actor Emmy in 2019, the year he turned heads for debuting gender-neutral red carpet looks. With roles lined up in Greg Berlanti's Little Shop of Horrors film and as a genderless Fairy Godmother in the Cinderella remake, Porter next headlines New York City's televised Pride special on June 28.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Good Times and The Jeffersons.

Norman Lear truly pioneered the telling of our stories in the mainstream.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"The characters are three-dimensional human beings and not simply just clownin’ as the archetype, the magical queen sprinkling fairy dust all over the world.\"\n\nThe 'Queer Eye' Cast – Bobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Tan France, Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness\n\nAt this point — seven Emmys (including two for outstanding structured reality program) and a fifth season that drops June 5 on Netflix — it no longer seems fair to refer to them strictly as \"The Fab Five.\" Berk, Brown, France, Porowski and Van Ness have each developed his own side hustle while remaining committed to advancing causes of inclusivity, positivity and community in books and other TV projects.\n\nTHE PERSON I THINK DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THEIR ACTIVISM\n\nBERK \"Taylor Swift. To watch some of our community come after her for speaking up in support of equal rights was very sad and frustrating to me.\"\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW\n\nBROWN \"Sean Sasser on The Real World: San Francisco.

But Sciamma has been exploring queer identity in her work for years, notably in 2011's Tomboy. Behind the scenes, Sciamma is a staunch advocate for female directors and was a key organizer of the 2018 women's protest at Cannes.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"When Night Is Falling.\"\n\nI'LL FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD'S LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHEN \"It won't feel like saving lives.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"A Parisian lesbian nightclub in the '30s.\"\n\nJustin Simien\n\nNetflix series Dear White People, an adaptation of his indie film of the same name, is set to graduate with a fourth and final season. The show will leave a legacy of authentic depictions of sexuality — including scenes involving gay character Lionel (DeRon Horton), modeled after Simien himself. The creator has expanded his workload (and profile) with podcast Don't @ Me and Hulu horror comedy film Bad Hair.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"My character Lionel in Dear White People. I literally couldn't find myself in the culture.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"A depiction of black gay men that is neither tragic nor idealized. The 'gay black spirit' drives so much popular culture, through slang, music, fashion, meme culture, dance and all manners of 'the arts.' Yet, it is still all too rare to find — or produce in Hollywood — stories where the humanity of gay black men is not in question, but is a given and is central to the story.\"\n\nLilly Singh\n\nThe first late night show hosted by a bisexual woman of color, albeit one that airs at 1:35 a.m., Singh's A Little Late pulls 670,000 nightly viewers and recently scored a second-season renewal. Singh, who was tapped to emcee the 2020 GLAAD Media Awards, remains a digital force with 15 million YouTube subscribers — many of whom, says the Canadian import, followed suit after she came out of the closet in 2019.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Truthfully, being someone who identifies as bisexual and is also of South Asian descent, I haven't really seen much on television that I feel represents me.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"As someone who came out later in life, I'd love to see a story about learning/living your truth as an adult.\"\n\nJill Soloway\n\nThe Emmy-winning patriarchy toppler finally got to close out the groundbreaking Transparent with a musical finale after losing its lead, Jeffrey Tambor, to a 2018 sexual harassment scandal. With that chapter behind them, Soloway landed a plum writing and directing assignment for Red Sonja, a fantasy property ripe for a postfeminist reinterpretation from the first major public figure to come out as nonbinary.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"As someone who identifies as nonbinary, I’m realizing I don’t think I ever felt represented as a kid — especially because I thought of myself as cis and female at the time.

I've been making art with her for decades, and she is always raising the voices of the people in the room around her through her art, teaching and advocacy.\"\n\nLGBTQ STORY I'D LOVE TO SEE ONSCREEN \"The journey of a nonbinary person realizing they feel most stable when their own gender is constantly moving. Folks who feel male and female and both and neither in a constantly swirling whirl need their heroes, too.\"\n\nAmandla Stenberg\n\nWith lead roles in teen romance Everything, Everything and the socially minded YA adaptation The Hate U Give, Stenberg parlayed her prominence into activism via online platforms. Coming out as queer on Teen Vogue's Snapchat in 2016, the actor, who stars in Damien Chazelle's Netflix series The Eddy, uses social media to spotlight the POC LGBTQ community.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"The Watermelon Woman upon an intensive search for black dyke content.

The creator has fought to authentically portray everything from messy coming out stories to anal sex.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"I didn’t realize at the time but probably the original Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

Vachon's upcoming projects see her reteaming with director Todd Haynes for a documentary on The Velvet Underground, producing a Netflix mini­series about fashion designer Halston (starring Ewan McGregor) and delivering on a just-inked first-look deal with MGM.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"There was so little for so long for queer gals! I saw West Side Story when I was about 10 — there is a character called Anybodys, who is a kind of desperate tomboy who isn’t really accepted by anyone.

Featuring interviews with Ellen DeGeneres, Neil Patrick Harris and Lena Waithe, Visible: Out on Television became one of the new streamer's breakout hits.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW\n\nCRUZ \"Myself on TV on My So-Called Life. Almost every day I receive a message from someone who wants to communicate to me how important Rickie Vasquez is to them.\"\n\nWHITE \"Danny Roberts on The Real World: New Orleans.

Lana is prepping a new installment of the Matrix franchise, a huge tentpole for a trans filmmaker, while Lilly has taken to advocacy on Twitter and in queer Showtime comedy Work in Progress (starring and co-created by Abby McEnany).\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW\n\nLILLY \"Trans people are inclined toward imaginary spaces. We have to literally invent our worlds down to the language to describe ourselves. So in the same way I had to forge my identity in the dogmatic binary world that was thrust on me, I had to cobble my representation together in a media mosaic. Because I was at a loss for how I could even begin to explain my own trans-ness, I think I gravitated toward imaginary spaces in narrative: genre fiction, science fiction and fantasy. Through a trans lens, I could find myself in monster movies like Creature From the Black Lagoon or King Kong. When you think of these movies through a heteronormative mindset, the 'love story' aspect to them is kind of preposterous and outlandish. But if you put on your 'trans-o-vision,' King Kong and Fay Wray are not two separate identities, but one. The monster, in this case, longs for an unachievable feminine ideal in a world that won’t just 'not allow' it, it will eradicate it. It’s why I always am down with the monster. 'Yeah! Fuck shit up!'\"\n\nLena Waithe\n\nAfter her 2017 Emmy win for writing a semi-autobiographical coming-out story on Master of None, the multihyphenate wasted no time in creating series (The Chi) and features (Queen & Slim) that highlight Black America and the LGBTQ community — all while mentoring new voices and achieving milestones.

He's responsible for Netflix's substantial and still-growing collection of YA shows and has made a habit of shepherding projects — including Stranger Things, 13 Reasons Why, Special and Atypical — with inclusive casts and characters that explore themes of identity, self-discovery and representation.\n\nI FIRST FELT REPRESENTED WHEN I SAW \"Ryan Phillippe playing a gay teen on One Life to Live in 1992.

He's already made his mark on the show playing Kim Jong Un, Andrew Yang and Chinese economic official Chen \"Trade Daddy\" Biao.
