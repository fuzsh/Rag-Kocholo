        "text": "“Why would someone add their pronouns to their signature line?” and “I heard that they identify as queer, but I thought that was an offensive term?” are some of the complex and increasingly common questions we’re exposed to in the workplace.\n\nLGBTQ+ identity is not a monolith, and no one group or person’s experience is identical. Sexual orientation and gender identity are deeply personal experiences that exist on a spectrum. Although LGBTQ+ identities have always existed, some societies have shunned and shamed people with diverse identities to keep them from living authentically. As our world increasingly acknowledges, accepts and celebrates diversity, we learn more about and better understand sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nEvery person is on their unique journey, and we encourage you to share this resource kit on social media with your family, friends and communities to amplify LGBTQ+ voices and expand awareness."
