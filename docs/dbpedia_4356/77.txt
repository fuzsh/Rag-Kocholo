In this case, the video decoder 205 needs to perform decoding processing on all of the basic stream Cb and the extended streams Ch1, Ch2, and Ch3.

the transmission apparatus 100 in the transmission apparatus 100, information indicating the decoding order is added to the access units of the basic stream and the extension stream. Therefore, on the receiving side, the decoding processing of the access unit of the basic stream and the extended stream can be easily performed in the correct order by referring to the information indicating the decoding order, and the reception of the stream packet on the receiving side is decoded. Even when the order is not correct, it is possible to avoid that the decoding process is delayed.

the transmission / reception system 10 including the transmission device 100 and the reception device 200 is shown, but the configuration of the transmission / reception system to which the present technology can be applied is not limited thereto.

the configuration of the receiver 200 may be a set-top box and a monitor connected by a digital interface such as HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface).

the set-top box can obtain the display capability information by acquiring EDID (Extended display identification data) from the monitor.

EDID Extended display identification data

HDMI High-Definition Multimedia Interface

the container is a transport stream (MPEG-2 TS)

MPEG-2 TS transport stream

the present technology can be similarly applied to a system configured to be distributed to receiving terminals using a network such as the Internet.

the Internet distribution it is often distributed in a container of MP4 or other formats.

containers of various formats such as transport stream (MPEG-2 TS) or MMT (MPEG Media Transport) used in the digital broadcasting standard and ISOBMFF (MP4) used in Internet distribution are available as containers. Applicable.

this technique can also take the following structures.

a basic stream including encoded image data for each picture of basic format image data as an access unit and a predetermined number of extension streams each including encoded image data for each picture of high quality format image data as an access unit are included.

a receiving unit for receiving a container in a predetermined format A processing unit that obtains basic format image data or predetermined high quality format image data by processing part or all of the basic stream or the basic stream and the predetermined number of extension streams;

the encoded image data for each picture of the high quality format image data is obtained by subjecting the high quality format image data to a predictive encoding process referring to the basic format image data and / or other high quality format image data.

a receiving unit includes a basic stream including encoded image data for each picture of basic format image data as an access unit and a predetermined number of encoded image data for each picture of high quality format image data as an access unit.

a receiving step of receiving a container of a predetermined format including an extension stream Processing the basic stream, or the basic stream and part or all of the predetermined number of extension streams to obtain basic format image data or predetermined high quality format image data,

the encoded image data for each picture of the high quality format image data is obtained by subjecting the high quality format image data to a predictive encoding process referring to the basic format image data and / or other high quality format image data.

Information indicating the decoding order is added to the access unit of the extension stream,

a receiving method in which, in the processing step, the decoding process of the access unit of the extension stream is performed in an order based on the information indicating the decoding order.

the main feature of the present technology is that a predetermined number of extension streams each including encoded image data for each picture of high-quality format image data as access units are transmitted with information indicating the decoding order added to each access unit.

the decoding process of each access unit of the extension stream can be easily performed in the correct order with reference to the information indicating the decoding order (see FIGS. 5 and 6).
