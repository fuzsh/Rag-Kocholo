13. Benign Waters  DNV OS-C-102 - Structural Design of Offshore Ships - World-wide operation - Benign waters - Environments at which the required to hull girder capacity calculated according to the LRFD method is less than the minimum section modulus according to the ‘Main Class Requirements’. © Det Norske Veritas AS. All rights reserved 28 September 2011 Slide 13

14. Benign Waters  Alternative design procedures - Alternative 1 - Ship Rules - The hull scantlings are based on the “main class requirements”.No direct calculations of wave bending moments and shear forces are required. - Alternative 2 - LRFD method - The hull is designed according to the principles given in Ch.1. The midship section modulus may be less than the ”main class requirements”. When design Alternative 2, LRFD method, is applied, the minimum midship section modulus according to the ”main class requirements” may be reduced by maximum 25%. © Det Norske Veritas AS.

21. Monitoring - Coating Monitoring Tool  The Nauticus Coating Monitoring Tool takes advantage of 3D technology to visualise the coating status and calculate re-coating areas. The tool also supports a structured recording of coating inspection results referring to pre-defined cells/bays of the ballast tanks. Finally, it assists you in preparing the re-coating specification and estimates the costs.  When tool is used one has stop to take a risk of unpredicted situations in respect to mintenance or failure. © Det Norske Veritas AS.
