While most container vessels are berthed upon arrival, the port operator PSA has collaborated with liners to adjust arrival schedules where possible. When adjustments are not feasible, the average waiting time for container vessels is about two to three days.\n\nThe increased demand for container handling in Singapore results from several container lines discharging more containers in Singapore to catch up on their next schedules. Additionally, the number of containers handled per vessel has increased.\n\nBesides the increased demands, container lines are leveraging PSA's cargo handling capabilities to manage container stowage onboard vessels and facilitate quick cargo discharge for subsequent port calls. This reliance on PSA highlights the confidence container liners have in the port.\n\nSince late 2023, MPA, together with the Ministry of Transport (MOT), has been working with PSA and the industry to prepare for higher vessel arrivals. PSA has added more manpower and container handling capacity, reactivated older berths and yards at Keppel Terminal, and increased weekly container handling from 770,000 TEUs to 820,000 TEUs.\n\nThree new berths at Tuas Port will commence operations later this year, increasing overall port handling capacity. PSA plans to expedite these new berths to boost container handling capacity in the near term.\n\nMPA and PSA are closely coordinating with container lines and regional feeders to update them on berth availability and advise on arrival times to minimize berthing delays.\n\n\"There is no delayed berthing experienced for other vessels that call at Singapore, which constitutes about two-thirds of vessel arrivals,\" MPA stated. \"Currently, there is no crowding in the anchorages.\"\n\nMOT and MPA will continue to collaborate with PSA to optimize the port's capabilities and capacity to minimize berth wait times, including proactive planning with container lines on their arrival times versus berth availability.\n\nMeanwhile, MPA noted that tanker and bulk vessel segments, including resupply and bunkering activities within the anchorages, remain unaffected.\n\n​The maritime and offshore industry constantly evolves, necessitating robust and reliable solutions for various operational challenges.
