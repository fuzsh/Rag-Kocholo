        "text": "There are two main legislations with respect to ship recycling in the market, one is IMO Hong Kong Convention (HKC) SR/CONF/45 and the other one is the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EU SRR) EC No 1257/2013. HKC has in total 6 guidelines and MEPC.269(68) is the guidelines for the development of the inventory of hazardous materials (IHM) under IMO.\n\nThe HKC will enter into force in June 2025.\n\nHKC will apply to ships, operating in the marine environment, which are equal to or above 500 GT. Navy ships and domestic ships are excluded from the scope. The HKC has two key issues:\n\nInventory of hazardous materials (IHM)\n\nAuthorization of ship recycling facilities\n\nThe EU SRR has entered into force in 2013 and general application has started at the end of 2018. Same as the HKC, EU SRR is applicable for ships, operating in the marine environment, which are equal to or above 500 GT. Navy ships and domestic ships are excluded from the scope. The EU SRR has two key issues\n\nInventory of hazardous materials (IHM)\n\nEU List of approved ship recycling facilities\n\nAccording to the EU SRR;\n\na) New ships flying a flag of an EU member state, shall be delivered with a valid IHM which is certified;\n\nb) End-of-life ships going for recycling shall have a valid IHM certified and shall be sent to one of the recycling facilities in the EU List of approved ship recycling facilities.\n\nc) Existing ships flying the flag of an EU member state and third-party ships visiting EU ports and anchorages, from 31 December 2020, shall have a valid IHM on-board, which is certified.\n\n“New ship” means a ship for which either:\n\n(a) the building contract is placed on or after the date of application of this Regulation;\n\n(b) in the absence of a building contract, the keel is laid or the ship is at a similar stage of construction six months after the date of application of this Regulation or thereafter; or\n\n(c) the delivery takes place thirty months after the date of application of this Regulation or thereafter.\n\nIHM is a list that provides ship-specific information on the actual hazardous materials present on board, their location and approximate quantities. The IHM has following parts:\n\nI. Materials contained in ship structure or equipment\n\nII. Operationally generated wastes, and\n\nIII. Stores\n\nThe IHM Part I shall be prepared and certified for new ships and ships in operation and shall be maintained and kept up to date during the operational life of the ship, while the IHM Part II & III are only required to be prepared when the ship is decided to be sent for recycling. For the preparation of IHM Part I, hazardous materials set out in appendix 1 and 2 of the HKC or Annex I and II of the EU SRR shall be investigated.\n\nIHM Part I for new ships should be developed at the design and construction stage based on suppliers’ declarations on hazardous material content of the products. The determination of hazardous materials present on board existing ships should, as far as practicable, be conducted as prescribed for new ships. Alternatively, in case where documentation is not available, samples shall be taken from the ships to investigate on the hazardous materials.\n\nFor new ships all the hazardous materials listed in Appendix 1 & 2 or Annex I & II shall be investigated, while for ships in operation Appendix 1 / Annex I is a must and Appendix 2 / Annex II is to be investigated as far as practicable.\n\nBased on our newly published DNV Statutory Interpretation on IHM:\n\n“The study of documents for inspection of Annex II of EU SRR-listed hazardous materials is considered 'as far as practicable'. For testing of Annex II of EU SRR listed substances it is considered 'as far as practicable' using samples already taken for testing of Annex I of EU SRR listed substances.”\n\nFor instance, the cable samples already taken to analyse PCB (Annex I substance) can be analysed for PBB/PBDE; paint samples taken can be analysed for PCN; vinyl cover floor samples taken for asbestos and PCB can be analysed CSCCPs.\n\nAppendix 2 to the HKC or Annex II of EU SRR listed hazardous materials can also be identified through available documents or visual checks such as checking the label of the batteries for lead; or smoke detectors for radioactive substances. In case those materials are tested and analysed at a sister vessel, as long as visually proven, the analyses result of the sister vessel can be used for the inspected vessel, as a reliable document.\n\nEU SRR is implemented in Norwegian legislation through the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement – in Regulation 2018-12-06 No. 1813. (The Norwegian regulation is available at: https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2018-12-06-1813?q=forskrift%20om%20gjenvinning%20av%20skip)\n\nThe European Economic Area (EEA) unites the EU Member States and the three EEA EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) into an Internal Market governed by the same basic rules.\n\nWith the DECISION OF THE EEA JOINT COMMITTEE (No 257/2018) of 5 December 2018 amending Annex XIII (Transport), Annex XX (Environment) to the EEA Agreement shall be amended as follows:\n\n1. The following indent is added in point 32c (Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council):\n\n32013 R 1257: Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 (OJ L 330, 10.12.2013, p. 1).\n\n2. The following point is inserted after point 32fg (Commission Implementing Decision 2011/632/EU):\n\n32fh. 32013 R 1257: Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 (EU SRR) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on ship recycling and amending Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and Directive 2009/16/EC (OJ L 330, 10.12.2013, p. 1).\n\nThis Decision has been entered into force on 6 December 2018, provided that all the notifications under Article 103(1) of the EEA Agreement have been made.\n\nConclusion: EU SRR applies to Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland as well.\n\nFor new building ships, the ship yard is responsible for the IHM preparation. IHM preparation for new ships is based on documentation which is provided by the suppliers in the form of Material Declarations (MDs) and Suppliers Declaration of Conformity (SDOC).\n\nMany shipyards already have experience of IHM preparation by collecting declarations from suppliers. Regardless of the scope of the IHM, whether HKC or EU SRR, our recommendation to shipyards is that; to instruct the suppliers to fill in and submit the EU SRR material declaration forms for their products, which cover 15 substances instead of 13 as per HKC. Since EU SRR covers the HKC requirements, if the owner orders the IHM as per EU SRR, this will save the effort to collect extra declarations for the two additional substances.\n\nThe forms of declaration can be downloaded here.\n\nFor ships in operation, shipowner is responsible for the IHM preparation. To comply with the HKC and EU SRR for your fleet, please follow up below procedures:\n\na) IHM Part I preparation\n\nThe steps for IHM preparation are as follows:\n\nTo collect information about the ship;\n\nTo assess collected information\n\nTo prepare visual and sampling check plan (VSCP);\n\nOn board visual and sampling check,\n\nTo send samples for laboratory analysis and preparation of IHM and IHM inspection report.\n\nFor EU SRR compliance for EU/EEA flagged vessels, PFOS must be investigated and HBCDD shall be investigated as far as practicable.\n\nThe whole process requires close cooperation of several parties and at best it would need one month until the IHM inspection report is finalized, therefore an early planning is highly recommended.\n\nOnce the IHM and IHM inspection report is ready, shipowner shall submit the IHM report to DNV for approval, and verification.\n\nThe IHM preparation shall be carried out by qualified HazMat experts and expert companies approved by DNV. Equivalent qualifications may be accepted upon agreement. Please refer to this list for the DNV approved companies.\n\nb) DNV IHM Part I certification\n\nPlan approval engineers of DNV review and approve IHM and IHM inspection report;\n\nAfter successful approval, ship owner shall apply for an IHM initial survey on board ship done by a DNV surveyor;\n\nAfter successful completion of the IHM initial survey, IHM certificate or statement of compliance will be issued by the surveyor with maximum 5 years validity in harmonization with the ship’s main class renewal date.\n\nTherefore, shipowner should arrange above step a) first, and contact DNV to prepare a proposal for IHM certification accordingly.\n\nDNV implements approval schemes for individuals and companies involved in IHM services. The schemes are, approval of individual personnel, so called “HazMat Expert”, approval of inspection company, so called “HazMat Expert Company” and approval of chemical laboratories – “HazMat Expert Lab”.\n\nThe individual HazMat Expert is qualified through our four-days HazMat Expert course. See \"What is the Approved HazMat Expert course?\" for more details for the course.\n\nThe company approval is for the IHM inspection, sampling and reporting, and laboratory approval is for the analysis part. Both are carried out through a one-day company audit at client premises in style of ISO 9001.\n\nFor the company approval, the precondition is at least one staff shall be fully approved HazMat Expert. To achieve this, he/she should participate in our HazMat Course, pass the exam, and have one real project supervised by DNV.\n\nFor laboratory approval, the accreditation of ISO 17025 is required, also at least one staff should be Approved HazMat Expert.\n\nYes, based on the flag requirements, the Green Passport (GP) certificate shall be converted into an HKC IHM or EU SRR IHM.\n\nGP Certificate was issued based on IMO Resolution A.962 (23), which is now obsolete. To convert the GP into an IHM, the IHM certification procedure for ships in operation shall apply, please see: How to comply with HKC and EU SRR for existing ships?.\n\nIt is advised that the shipowner contracts a qualified HazMat Expert company to do a gap analysis of the existing GP and compares it with the EU SRR / HKC requirements. Based on the gaps, the HazMat Expert may require on additional documents and/or conduct sampling and visual checks on board to do an inspection according to EU SRR / HKC requirements. Once the IHM and IHM inspection report is prepared by the HazMat Expert, shipowner shall submit the IHM report to DNV for approval, and verification. An on board IHM initial survey is a must for issuance of the respective SoC or Certificate.\n\nIt is the owner's responsibility to keep the Inventory of Hazardous Materials Part I up to date. Part I of the Inventory shall be appropriately maintained and updated especially after any repair or conversion of a ship. An IHM maintenance procedure shall be implemented including the assignment of a designated person, by keeping records of changes.\n\nIf any machinery or equipment or component is added to, removed or replaced or the hull coating is renewed, the MD/SDoC forms provided by the suppliers shall be properly filed and Part I of the IHM shall be updated. Updating is not required if identical parts or coatings are installed or applied. During the IHM renewal survey updated IHM together with maintenance records will be checked by the surveyors.\n\nSee detailed requirement in subsections 4.1.2 to 4.1.4 of the IHM Guidelines (Resolution MEPC.269(68)) and Article 5 in EU SRR 1257/2013.\n\nShipowners may have implemented the procedure based on HKC and it is suggested to review and advance the procedure to EU SRR.\n\nYes, for the IHM maintenance shipowner should collect MDs and SDoCs for all the purchased items that are falling into the scope of IHM Part I.\n\nDNV follows what is written in the Hong Kong Convention (HKC) and EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EU SRR). HKC Reg 5.3 says that “Part I of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials shall be properly maintained and updated throughout the operational life of the ship, reflecting new installations containing Hazardous Materials listed in Appendix 2 and relevant changes in ship structure and equipment, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization”. It refers to the MEPC IHM Guidelines. And MEPC IHM Guidelines 4.1.4 say “The checking of materials as provided in paragraphs 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 above should be based on the Material Declaration furnished by the suppliers in the shipbuilding supply chain”.\n\nHong Kong Convention Regulation 11.8 reads as follows: “If a ship at the time when a certificate expires is not in a port in which it is to be surveyed, the Administration may extend the period of validity of the certificate but this extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be surveyed and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so. No certificate shall be extended for a period longer than three months, and a ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new certificate. When the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.”\n\nThe port state control shall be limited to verifying that either an IHM certificate or a ready for recycling certificate is on board, both supplemented by the verified IHM, which, if valid, shall be accepted for the inspection. A detailed inspection may be carried out where a ship does not carry a valid certificate or there are clear grounds for believing that:\n\nthe condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificate, and/or IHM Part I; or\n\nthere is no procedure implemented on board the ship for the maintenance of IHM Part I.\n\nA ship may be warned, detained, dismissed or excluded from the ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of a Member State in the event that:\n\nit fails to submit to the relevant authorities of that Member State a copy of the IHM certificate or the ready for recycling certificate; or\n\nnon-compliance with the control measures for Hazardous Materials listed in appendix 1 to the HKC / Annex I to the EU SRR are identified.\n\nA Member State taking such action shall immediately inform the administration concerned.\n\nFailure to update the IHM shall not constitute a detainable deficiency, but any inconsistencies in the IHM shall be reported to the administration concerned and shall be rectified at the time of the next survey.\n\nIf an owner decides to send his EU/EEA flagged ship for recycling, he has to send his ship to a ship recycling facility (SRF) which is in the EU List of approved ship recycling facilities and apply for a final survey to get the Ready for Recycling (RfR) certificate.\n\nTo get the ready for recycling certificate, first IHM Part II and III shall be prepared by the owner, and together with the updated IHM Part I, he should send the whole IHM to the agreed SRF for the preparation of the ship specific ship recycling plan (SRP). The SRP shall be tacitly or explicitly approved by the competent authority of the SRF in accordance with the requirements of the state where the ship recycling facility is located, where applicable.\n\na) During the plan approval following documents would be checked:\n\nIHM Part I, II and III will be checked with respect to locations and approximate quantities\n\nSRP (if applicable approved by the competent authority of the SRF) to confirm the following:\n\nThe information in the IHM is reflected in the SRP\n\nInformation concerning the establishment, maintenance and monitoring of the safe-for-entry and safe-for hot work conditions for the specific ship, taking into account features such as its structure, configuration and previous cargo, and other necessary information on how the ship recycling plan is to be implemented.\n\nAfter successful approval, ship owner shall apply for an IHM final survey on board ship done by DNV surveyor;\n\nb) During the final survey the following documents will be checked\n\nIHM Part I, II and III stamped by DNV engineers\n\nSRP, approved by the competent authority of the SRF, if applicable\n\nEU Listed SRF\n\nAfter successful completion of the IHM final survey, Ready for Recycling Certificate will be issued by the surveyor with maximum 3 months validity.\n\nFor ships built before 1 July 2002\n\nShips built before 1 July 2002 may contain asbestos, but it should be managed properly - further guidance is available in MSC/Circ.1045 Guidelines for Maintenance and Monitoring of On-Board Materials Containing Asbestos.\n\nFor ships built between 1 July 2002 and 1 January 2011\n\nFor all ships, new installation of materials which contain asbestos shall be prohibited except for:\n\nvanes used in rotary vane compressors and rotary vane vacuum pumps;\n\nwatertight joints and linings used for the circulation of fluids when, at high temperature (in excess of 350ºC) or pressure (in excess of 7 x 106 Pa), there is a risk of fire, corrosion or toxicity; and\n\nsupple and flexible thermal insulation assemblies used for temperatures above 1000ºC.\n\nFor ships built after 1 January 2011\n\nThe 2009 Amendments to SOLAS (resolution MSC.282(86)), further amended the text to prohibit all new installation of asbestos on board ships. These came into force on 1 January 2011;\n\nIMO MSC.1/Circ.1374, Article 13 reads as follows:\n\n“When asbestos is detected on board, in contravention of SOLAS regulation II-1/3-5, action should be taken to have it removed. The removal – assigned to professional asbestos removal companies – should take place within a time frame of 3 years from the date when the contravention is found and should be conducted in close consultation with and, where applicable, under the supervision of the flag State concerned. In such cases, a suitable exemption certificate should be issued by the flag State.”\n\nIf Asbestos is detected on board, it may affect Safety Construction Certificate of the ship according to SOLAS requirement. Shipowner shall notify the flag state, and flag state would either decide to issue an exemption certificate or would give a time frame to the shipowner to remove the asbestos according to MSC/Circ.1045. Flag has the final say."
