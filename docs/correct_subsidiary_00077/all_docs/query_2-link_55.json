        "text": "¹ sCO2 (supercritical carbon dioxide): The state of carbon dioxide when a temperature and pressure above the critical point are applied, resulting in properties of both liquid and gas simultaneously. sCO2 is a highly efficient working fluid for generating power. Unlike conventional nuclear and thermal power plants that generate electricity by turning turbines with steam made by heating water, sCO2 generators produce electricity by using CO2 that is subjected to heat and pressure. The sCO2 power generation system is attracting attention as a next-generation power generation system since it is more efficient than steam turbines, economically feasible, and can be miniaturized, making it easy to connect with new and renewable energy sources.\n\n² Green ships: Eco-friendly vessels outfitted with energy efficient, green technologies aimed at suppressing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting IMO emissions standards.\n\n³ LNG FPSO (LNG floating production, storage, and offloading): A complex offshore plant that processes natural gas extracted from beneath the sea floor, refines and liquefies it into LNG, and subsequently stores and offloads it.\n\n⁴ SCR (selective catalytic reduction): Selective catalytic reduction is an advanced active emissions control technology system that reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) to near-zero levels by converting them to nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O). To do so, a catalyst is sprayed on the exhaust gas flowing out of the combustion chamber which decomposes NOx, a harmful substance, into N2 and H2O. Urea solutions diluted with water, ammonia, aqueous ammonia, etc. are used as catalysts in this process."
