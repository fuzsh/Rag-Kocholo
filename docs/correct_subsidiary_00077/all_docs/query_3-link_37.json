Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F105, February 2006 Introduction – Page 3 Relationship to Rules under preparation Parts of this Recommended Practice should be read in conjunction with the following two documents: — DNV-RP-F110 \"Global Buckling of Pipelines\", and — DNV-RP-C205 - \"Environmental Conditions and Environmental Loads\". However, these two documents are currently under preparation at DNV. Readers are requested to contact: RP-F110: Leif Collberg, TNCNO714, Det Norske Veritas, Veritasveien 1, N-1322 Høvik, mailto: Leif.Collberg@dnv.com RP-C205: Arne Nestegaard, TNCNO785, Det Norske Veritas, Veritasveien 1, N-1322 Høvik, mailto: Arne.Nestegard@dnv.com for more information, if required. Motives The existing design code, DNV-RP-F105 for \"Free Spanning Pipelines\" from March 2002, can be effectively applied to deal with both single and multiple spans vibrating predominantly in a single mode. In the case where there is a combination of long spans and high currents, not only does the fundamental eigen modes become activated, but also the higher modes. Such a multimode response is not prohibited by the design code. However, no detailed guidance is provided in the present Recommended Practice (RP) about the fatigue damage from multimode vibrations. During the Ormen Lange project a strong focus was put on design procedures for long free spans in order to make this project feasible and in order to save seabed intervention costs. A relatively large R&D project on free span vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) was performed. The results of this project was synthesised into a project specific guideline issued by DNV, concerning the calculation procedures and design acceptance criteria for long free span with multi-mode response. The main objective of this proposal is to include the experiences gained from the Ormen Lange Project regarding multi-mode and multi-span response and incorporate the latest R&D work relating to Free Spanning Pipelines. This proposal has been worked out through a JIP with Hydro and Statoil. In addition to the multi-mode response aspects, a general update and revision of the DNV-RP-F105 has been performed, based on feedback and experience from several projects and users. Main changes The most important changes in this update are: — Computational procedure for multi-mode analysis, selection of vibration modes and combination of stresses. — Guidance on mitigation measures for vortex-induced vibrations. — Ultimate limit state criteria (over-stress) updated. — Recalibrated safety factors. — Detailed calculation procedure for pipe-soil interaction. — Practical guidance on various aspects based on project experience from several sources. — Update of response models for vortex-induced vibrations based on available test results. — Clarified limitations and range of application. — Added mass modification during cross-flow vibrations. This update strengthens the position of this RP as the state-ofthe-art document for free spanning pipelines. It allows longer spans to be accepted as detailed calculation procedures for multiple mode response is given.

General 1.1 Introduction 1.1.1 The present document considers free spanning pipelines subjected to combined wave and current loading. The premises for the document are based on technical development within pipeline free span technology in recent R&D projects, as well as design experience from recent and ongoing projects, i.e.: — DNV Guideline 14, see Mørk & Fyrileiv (1998). — The sections regarding Geotechnical Conditions and part of the hydrodynamic model are based on the research performed in the GUDESP project, see Tura et al. (1994). — The sections regarding Free Span Analysis and in-line Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) fatigue analyses are based on the published results from the MULTISPAN project, see Mørk et al. (1997). — Numerical study based on CFD simulations for vibrations of a pipeline in the vicinity of a trench, performed by Statoil, DHI & DNV, see Hansen et al. (2001). — Further, recent R&D and design experience e.g. from Åsgard Transport, ZEEPIPE, TOGI and TROLL OIL pipeline projects are implemented, see Fyrileiv et al. (2005). — Ormen Lange tests aimed at moderate and very long spans with multimodal behaviour, see Fyrileiv et al. (2004), Chezhian et al. (2003) and Mørk et al. (2003). The basic principles applied in this document are in agreement with most recognised rules and reflect state-of-the-art industry practice and latest research. This document includes a brief introduction to the basic hydrodynamic phenomena, principles and parameters. For a thorough introduction see e.g. Sumer & Fredsøe (1997) and Blevins (1994). 1.2 Objective 1.2.1 The objective of this document is to provide rational design criteria and guidance for assessment of pipeline free spans subjected to combined wave and current loading. 1.3 Scope and application 1.3.1 Detailed design criteria are specified for Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and Fatigue Limit State (FLS) due to in-line and cross-flow Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) and direct wave loading. The following topics are considered: — — — — — — — methodologies for free span analysis requirements for structural modelling geotechnical conditions environmental conditions and loads requirements for fatigue analysis VIV response and direct wave force analysis models acceptance criteria. 1.3.2 Free spans can be caused by: — — — — seabed unevenness change of seabed topology (e.g. scouring, sand waves) artificial supports/rock beams etc. strudel scours. 1.3.3 The following environmental flow conditions are described in this document: — steady flow due to current — oscillatory flow due to waves — combined flow due to current and waves. The flow regimes are discussed in 1.9. 1.3.4 This Recommended Practice is strictly speaking only applicable for circular pipe cross-section of steel pipelines. However, it can be applied with care to non-circular cross-sections such as piggy-back solutions as long as other hydrodynamic loading phenomena, e.g. galloping, are properly taken into account. Basic principles may also be applied to more complex cross sections such as pipe-in-pipe, bundles, flexible pipes and umbilicals. 1.3.5 There are no limitations to span length and span gap with respect to application of this Recommended Practice. Both single spans and multiple spans scenarios, either in single mode or multiple mode vibration, can be assessed using this RP. Unless otherwise documented, the damage contribution for different modes should relate to the same critical (weld) location along the span. 1.3.6 The free span analysis may be based on approximate response expressions or a refined FE approach depending on the free span classification and response type, see Sec.6. The following cases are considered: — single spans — spans interacting with adjacent/side spans. The stress ranges and natural frequencies should normally be obtained from an FE-approach. Requirements to the structural modelling and free span analyses are given in Sec.6. 1.3.7 The following models are considered: — response models (RM) — force models (FM). An amplitude response model is applicable when the vibration of the free span is dominated by vortex induced resonance phenomena. A force model (Morison’s equation) may be used when the free span dominated by hydrodynamic loads such as direct wave loads. The selection of an appropriate model may be based on the prevailing flow regimes, see 1.9. 1.3.8 The fatigue criterion is limited to stress cycles within the elastic range. Low cycle fatigue due to elasto-plastic behaviour is considered outside the scope of this document. 1.3.9 Fatigue loads due to trawl interaction, cyclic loads during installation or pressure variations are not considered herein but must be considered as a part of the integrated fatigue damage assessment. 1.3.10 Procedures and criteria for structural design or assessment of free spanning HT/HP pipelines have not been included within the scope of this Recommended Practice. Free spans due to uplift are however within the scope of this document. Note: For information concerning a reference document (currently in preparation), regarding procedures and criteria for structural design or assessment of HP/HT pipelines, contact TNCNO714, DNV, Høvik, Norway. 1.3.11 The main aspects of a free span assessment together with key parameters and main results are illustrated in the figure below.

However some limitations apply and these are discussed in Appendix C, C.2. 1.4.3 For a more detailed account of riser VIV, reference is made to the DNV-RP-F204 “Riser Fatigue”. 1.5 Safety philosophy 1.5.1 The safety philosophy adopted herein complies with Sec.2 in DNV-OS-F101. 1.5.2 The reliability of the pipeline against failure is ensured by use of a Load and Resistance Factors Design Format (LRFD). — For the in-line and cross-flow VIV acceptance criterion, the set of safety factors is calibrated to acceptable target reliability levels using reliability-based methods. — For all other acceptance criteria, the recommended safety factors are based on engineering judgement in order to obtain a safety level equivalent to modern industry practice. — Use of case specific safety factors based on quantification of uncertainty in fatigue damage, can also be considered. 1.6 Free span morphological classification 1.6.1 The objective of the morphological classification is to define whether the free span is isolated or interacting. The morphological classification determines the degree of complexity required of the free span analysis: — Two or more consecutive free spans are considered to be isolated (i.e. single span) if the static and dynamic behaviour is unaffected by neighbouring spans. — A sequence of free spans is interacting (i.e. multi-spanning) if the static and dynamic behaviour is affected by the presence of neighbouring spans. If the free span is interacting, more than one span must be included in the pipe/seabed model. 1.6.2 The classification may be useful in the following cases: — for evaluating multi-mode response of single and multispans — for evaluation of scour induced free spans and in application of approximate response quantities described in Sec.6.7. 1.6.3 The morphological classification should in general be determined based on detailed static and dynamic analyses. DET NORSKE VERITAS\n\n9. Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F105, February 2006 Page 9 Guidance note: When long segments of the pipeline are analysed in automated FE analysis tools, certain limitations can arise for identifying interacting spans. — isolated single span - multi-mode response — interacting multispans - single mode response — interacting multispans - multi-mode response. The following example illustrates the same: 1.7.2 In case several vibration modes (in the same direction) may become active at a given flow velocity, multi-mode response shall be considered. Two free spans which are separated by a distance of 1000 m and each with a span length of about 50 m. The FE analysis estimates that some of the response frequencies for these two spans are identical. Further, due to numerical approximations or due to round off errors, the results may be presented as single mode response at these two spans, i.e. it is a single interacting mode at these two spans. However, in reality these two spans are physically separated by a considerable distance, and not interacting. If isolated spans are incorrectly modelled as interacting multispans, it may also lead to significant errors in estimating the fatigue damage. The fatigue damage is dependent on the unit stress amplitudes, as discussed in Sec.4. The unit stress amplitudes are dependent on the normalised mode shape, which is related to the span length over which the normalisation is considered. When long multispans are analysed, the normalisation will not be same as for an isolated single span, within the multi-spanning system. This will in turn lead to errors. Experience has shown that in case of close frequencies for spans, the FE analysis may predict interaction even though the physical distance between the spans is quite long. In case of mode shapes with deflection in spans that seem to be physically well separated, use of appropriate axial pipe-soil stiffness and/or local restraints in between the spans should be considered to separate individual modes. Hence, caution should be exercised when using automated FE tools for identifying interacting spans. ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- 1.6.4 In lieu of detailed data, Figure 1-2 may be used to classify spans into isolated or interacting depending on soil types and span/span support lengths. Figure 1-2 is provided only for indicative purposes and is applicable only for horizontal supports. The curves are, in strict terms, only valid for the vertical (cross-flow) dynamic response but may also be used for assessment of the horizontal (in-line) response. Note that Figure 1-2 indicates that for a given span scenario the spans will tend to interact more as the soil becomes softer. However, given a seabed profile, a softer soil will tend to have shorter and fewer spans and probably less interacting spans than a harder soil. sand Interacting Rel. length of adjacent span, L a/L 1.0 stiff clay Isolated 0.8 0.6 very soft clay soft/firm clay 0.4 0.2 La Lsh L 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Relative span shoulder length, L sh/L 0.9 1.0 Figure 1-2 Classification of free spans 1.7 Free span response classification 1.7.1 The free spans vibrations can be classified and analysed under the following categories: — isolated single span - single mode response 1.7.3 The following, simple and conservative procedure can be used to check for single or multi-mode response: — Establish the lowest frequencies in both vertical (crossflow) and horizontal (in-line) direction for the free span to be considered. — Identify frequencies that may be excited by applying the following simplified criterion: VRd,CF > 2 for cross-flow VRd,IL > 1 for in-line Here, the reduced velocity may be calculated using the 1year flow condition at the pipe level, see Sec.3. — In case only one mode meets this criterion, the response is single mode. If not, the response is multi-mode. Guidance note: Normally the in-line and cross-flow frequencies are to be established using FE analysis. The approximate response quantities in Sec.6.7 can be used, if applicable. ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- 1.8 Free span response behaviour 1.8.1 An overview of typical free span characteristics is given in the table below as a function of the free span length. The ranges indicated for the normalised free span length in terms of (L/D) are tentative and given for illustration only. Table 1-1 L/D L/D < 30 1) Response description Very little dynamic amplification. Normally not required to perform comprehensive fatigue design check. Insignificant dynamic response from environmental loads expected and unlikely to experience VIV. 30 < L/D < 100 Response dominated by beam behaviour. Typical span length for operating conditions. Natural frequencies sensitive to boundary conditions (and effective axial force). 100 < L/D < 200 Response dominated by combined beam and cable behaviour. Relevant for free spans at uneven seabed in temporary conditions. Natural frequencies sensitive to boundary conditions, effective axial force (including initial deflection, geometric stiffness) and pipe “feed in”. Refer to 1.7 for free span response classification, which provides practical guidance for engineering applications, with respect to single and multi-mode response. L/D > 200 Response dominated by cable behaviour. Relevant for small diameter pipes in temporary conditions. Natural frequencies governed by deflected shape and effective axial force. 1) For hot pipelines (response dominated by the effective axial force) or under extreme current conditions (Uc > 1.0 − 2.0 m/s) this L/D limit may be misleading. DET NORSKE VERITAS\n\n10. Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F105, February 2006 Page 10 1.9 Flow regimes 1.9.1 The current flow velocity ratio, α = Uc/(Uc + Uw) (where Uc is the current velocity normal to the pipe and Uw is the significant wave-induced velocity amplitude normal to the pipe, see Sec.4), may be applied to classify the flow regimes as follows: α < 0.5 wave dominant - wave superimposed by current. In-line direction: in-line loads may be described according to Morison’s formulae, see Sec.5. In-line VIV due to vortex shedding is negligible. Cross-flow direction: cross-flow loads are mainly due to asymmetric vortex shedding. A response model, see Sec.4, is recommended. wave dominant – current superimposed by wave. In-line direction: in-line loads may be described according to Morison’s formulae, see Sec.5. In-line VIV due to vortex shedding is mitigated due to the presence of waves. Cross-flow direction: cross-flow loads are mainly due to asymmetric vortex shedding and resemble the current dominated situation. A response model, see Sec.4, is recommended. current dominant In-line direction: in-line loads comprises the following components: 0.5 < α < 0.8 α > 0.8 — a steady drag dominated component — an oscillatory component due to regular vortex shedding For fatigue analyses a response model applies, see Sec.4. In-line loads according to Morison’s formulae are normally negligible. Cross-flow direction: cross-flow loads are cyclic and due to vortex shedding and resembles the pure current situation. A response model, see Sec.4, is recommended. Note that α = 0 correspond to pure oscillatory flow due to waves and α = 1 corresponds to pure (steady) current flow. The flow regimes are illustrated in Figure 1-3. 6 Flow Velocity (U c+Uw) 3 current dominated flow wave dominated flow Guidance note: The key difference between these methods is not in the solution strategy, but the basis and validity range for the applied empirical parameters. Further, some tools vary in modelling flexibility and extent of user defined control parameters (bandwidth, selection of Strouhal no., etc.) to estimate fatigue damage. ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- 1.10.4 As a third option, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the turbulent fluid flow around one- or several pipes can in principle be applied for VIV assessment to overcome the inherent limitations of the state-of-practice engineering approach. The application of CFD for VIV assessment is at present severely limited by the computational effort required. In addition, documented work is lacking which shows that the estimated fatigue damage based on CFD for realistic free span scenarios gives better and satisfactory response, than the methods described above. 1.10.5 Particularly for VIV of special pipeline designs (pipein-pipe, bundled pipelines, piggy back pipelines, etc.) with limited experience, experiments should be considered. Experiments should also be performed when considering pipelines which use new designs for VIV mitigation devices. 1.10.6 Circular and complex cross-sections such as pipe-inpipe and bundles may be treated as an ordinary pipe as long as changes in structural response, damping and fatigue properties are accounted for. α=0.8 1.11 Relationship to other Rules 2 α=0.5 1.11.1 This document formally supports and complies with the DNV Offshore Standard “Submarine Pipeline Systems”, DNV-OS-F101, 2000 and is considered to be a supplement to relevant National Rules and Regulations. 1 0 1.10.3 Another method is based on semi-empirical lift coefficient curves as a function of vibration amplitude and non-dimensional vibration frequency. By use of the concept of added mass the stress response comes as a direct result from the analysis, see Larsen & Koushan (2005) 1.10.7 Non-circular bluff-body cross-sections such as piggy back solutions may be considered by applying a larger hydrodynamic diameter and considering the most critical cross-sectional orientation in the calculations. 5 4 1.10.2 This RP applies the so-called Response Models approach to predict the vibration amplitudes due to vortex shedding. These response models are empirical relations between the reduced velocity defined in terms of the still-water natural frequency and the non-dimensional response amplitude. Hence the stress response is derived from an assumed vibration modes with an empirical amplitude response. α=0.0 -1 -2 time 1.11.2 This document is supported by other DNV offshore codes as follows: — Recommended Practice DNV-RP-C203 “Fatigue Strength Analysis of Offshore Steel Structures” — Offshore Standard DNV-OS-F201 “Dynamic Risers” — Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F204 “Riser Fatigue\". Figure 1-3 Flow regimes 1.9.2 Oscillatory flow due to waves is stochastic in nature, and a random sequence of wave heights and associated wave periods generates a random sequence of near seabed horizontal oscillations. For VIV analyses, the significant velocity amplitude, Uw, is assumed to represent a single sea-state. This is likely to be a conservative approximation. In case of conflict between requirements of this RP and a referenced DNV Offshore Code, the requirements of the code with the latest revision date shall prevail.

Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F105, February 2006 Page 11 1.12 Definitions 1.12.1 Effective Span Length is the length of an idealised fixed-fixed span having the same structural response in terms of natural frequencies as the real free span supported on soil. 1.12.2 Force Model is in this document a model where the environmental load is based on Morison’s force expression. 1.12.3 Gap is defined as the distance between the pipe and the seabed. The gap used in design, as a single representative value, must be characteristic for the free span The gap may be calculated as the average value over the central third of the span. 1.12.4 Marginal Fatigue Capacity is defined as the fatigue capacity (life) with respect to one sea state defined by its significant wave height, peak period and direction. 1.12.5 Multi-mode Response, denotes response for a span where several vibration modes may be excited simultaneously in the same direction (in-line or cross-flow). 1.12.6 Multi-spans are spans where the adjacent spans have a influence on the behaviour and response of a span. 1.12.7 Non-stationary Span is a span where the main span characteristics such as span length and gap change significantly over the design life, e.g. due to scouring of the seabed. 1.12.8 Response Model is a model where the structural response due to VIV is determined by hydrodynamic parameters. 1.12.9 Span Length is defined as the length where a continuous gap exists, i.e. as the visual span length. 1.12.10 Single Span is a span which is an isolated span that can be assessed independent of the neighbouring spans. 1.12.11 Stationary Span is a span where the main span characteristics such as span length and gap remain the same over the design life. 1.13 Abbreviations CF CSF FLS FM IL LRFD OCR RM RD RPV SRSS TD ULS VIV cross-flow concrete stiffness factor fatigue limit state force model in-line load and resistance factors design format over-consolidation ratio (only clays) response model (VIV) response domain return period values square root of the sum of squares time domain ultimate limit state vortex induced vibrations 1.14 Symbols 1.14.1 Latin aκ parameter for rain-flow counting factor a Ae Ai characteristic fatigue strength constant in-line unit amplitude stress (stress induced by a pipe (vibration mode) deflection equal to an outer diameter D) ACF cross-flow unit amplitude stress Ap cross sectional area of penetrated pipe As pipe steel cross section area (AY/D) normalised in-line VIV amplitude (AZ/D) normalised cross-flow VIV amplitude b linearisation constant B pipe-soil contact width bκ parameter for rain flow counting factor Ca added mass coefficient (CM-1) Ca, CF-RES added mass coefficient due to cross-flow response CD drag coefficient CD0 basic drag coefficient CM the inertia coefficient 0 CM basic inertia coefficient CL coefficient for lateral soil stiffness CV coefficient for vertical soil stiffness CT constant for long-term wave period distribution C1-6 Boundary condition coefficients c(s) soil damping per unit length d trench depth D pipe outer diameter (including any coating) Dfat deterministic fatigue damage Ds outer steel diameter E Young's modulus EI bending stiffness e seabed gap es void ratio (e/D) seabed gap ratio fcyc frequency used for fatigue stress cycle counting in case of multimode response fc frequency used for fatigue stress cycle counting in case of multimode response fn n’th eigen frequency of span in-line (fn,IL) or crossflow (fn,CF) natural frequency (determined at no flow around the pipe) fcn concrete construction strength fs vortex shedding frequency AIL (Strouhal frequency) = S t F FL FV fv fw F() FX g gc gD gI G external cross-section area internal cross-section (bore) area DET NORSKE VERITAS U D correction factor for pipe roughness lateral pipe-soil contact force vertical pipe-soil contact force dominating vibration frequency wave frequency distribution function cumulative distribution function acceleration of gravity correction function due to steady current drag force term inertia force term shear modulus of soil or incomplete complementary Gamma function\n\n12.

Design Criteria 2.1 General 2.1.2 Vibrations due to vortex shedding and direct wave loads are acceptable provided the fatigue and ULS criteria specified herein are fulfilled. 2.1.3 In case several potential vibration modes can become active at a given flow velocity, all these modes shall be considered. Unless otherwise documented the damage contribution for every mode should relate to the same critical (weld) location. 2.1.4 Figure 2-1 shows part of a flow chart for a typical pipeline design. After deciding on diameter, material, wall thickness, trenching or not and coating for weight and insulation, any global buckling design and release of effective axial force needs to be addressed before the free spans are to be assessed. It must be emphasised that the free span assessment must be based on a realistic estimate of the effective axial force, and any changes due to sagging in spans, lateral buckling, end expansion, changes in operational conditions, etc. must be properly accounted for. Note that sequence in Figure 2-1 is not followed in all projects. Normally an initial routing will be performed before detailed pipeline design is started. As such a typical design process will be to follow this flow chart in iterations until a final, acceptable design is found. As span length/height and effective axial force may change significantly for different operational conditions, one particular challenge, especially for flow lines, becomes to decide the most critical/governing span scenarios. This will also depend on any global buckling or other release of effective axial force by end expansion or sagging into spans, etc. DET NORSKE VERITAS\n\n14.

These aspects are not covered in this document. Guidance may be found in Mørk et al. (1999) and Fyrileiv et al. (2000). 2.2.4 Changes in operational conditions such as pressure and temperature may cause significant changes in span characteristics and must be accounted for in the free span assessment. Guidance note: One example may be flowlines installed on uneven seabed and which buckle during operation. The combination of shut-down and lateral buckles may cause tension in the pipeline and several free spans to develop. The span length and span height may vary significantly over the range of operational conditions (pressure/temperature). In such cases the whole range of operational conditions should be checked as the lowest combination may be governing for the free span design. — Scour induced free spans caused by seabed erosion or bedform activities. The free span scenarios (span length, gap ratio, etc.) may change with time. — Unevenness induced free spans caused by an irregular seabed profile. Normally the free span scenario is time invariant unless operational parameters such as pressure and temperature change significantly. 2.2.5 Other changes during the design life such as corrosion must also be considered in the span assessment where relevant. 2.2.2 In the case of scour induced spans, where no detailed information is available on the maximum expected span length, gap ratio and exposure time, the following apply: Guidance note: Subtracting half the corrosion allowance when performing the span assessment may be applied in case of no better information. — Where uniform conditions exist and no large-scale mobile ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- DET NORSKE VERITAS\n\n15. Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F105, February 2006 Page 15 2.3 Screening fatigue criteria 2.3.1 The screening criteria proposed herein apply to fatigue caused by Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) and direct wave loading in combined current and wave loading conditions. The screening criteria have been calibrated against full fatigue analyses to provide a fatigue life in excess of 50 years. The criteria apply to spans with a response dominated by the 1st symmetric mode (one half wave) and should preferably be applied for screening analyses only. If violated, more detailed fatigue analyses should be performed. The ULS criterion in 2.5 must always be checked. Guidance note: The screening criteria as given in 2.3 are calibrated with safety factors to provide a fatigue life in excess of 50 years. As such these criteria are intended to be used for the operational phase. However, by applying the 10 year return period value for current for the appropriate season, Uc,10year, instead of the 100 year return period value, the criteria may be used also for the temporary phases (as-laid/empty and flooded). 2.3.5 If a fatigue analysis is required, a simplified estimate of the fatigue damage can be computed by adding the wave induced flow to the current long-term distribution or neglecting the influence of the waves for deepwater pipelines. If this criterion is violated, then a full fatigue analyses due direct wave action is required. 2.3.6 Fatigue analysis due to direct wave action is not required provided: U c,100 year 2 > U w ,1year + U c,100 year 3 and the above screening criteria for in-line VIV are fulfilled. If this criterion is violated, then a full fatigue analyses due to in-line VIV and direct wave action is required. Guidance note: Section 2.3.6 states that full fatigue analysis is required if the 1year significant wave-induced flow at pipe level is larger than half the 100-year current velocity at pipe level. It is also possible to apply the screening criteria in the same way as the traditional on-set criterion in order to establish conservative allowable free span lengths even though the above mentioned wave effect criterion is violated. If the flow is current dominated, the free span may be assessed by adding a characteristic wave-induced flow component to the current velocity as expressed in the in-line VIV screening criterion, i.e. 1-year return period wave induced flow. If the flow velocity is dominated by the waves, then generally a full fatigue analysis has to be performed. However, the in-line VIV screening criterion may still be used provided that a quasistatic Morison force calculation shows that the fatigue due to direct wave action could be neglected or is insignificant compared to in-line VIV fatigue. ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- 2.3.2 The screening criteria proposed herein are based on the assumption that the current velocity may be represented by a 3-parameter Weibull distribution. If this is not the case, e.g. for bi-modal current distributions, care must be taken and the applicability of these screening criteria checked by full fatigue calculations. 2.3.3 The in-line natural frequencies fn,IL must fulfil: f n , IL γ IL > ⎛ L/D⎞ 1 ⋅ ⎜1 − ⎟⋅ 250 ⎠ α ⋅D ⎝ U c ,100 year V IL R , onset where γIL α ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- Screening factor for in-line, see 2.6 Current flow ratio = 2.4 Fatigue criterion U c ,100 year 2.4.1 The fatigue criterion can be formulated as: U w ,1 year + U c ,100 year η ⋅ Tlife ≥ Texposure Minimum value of 0.6.

The fatigue life is the minimum of the in-line and the crossflow fatigue lives.

Marginal fatigue capacity against direct wave actions in a single sea-state characterised by (Hs, Tp, θ) using mean value of current, see Sec.5.2.2. 2.4.10 Unless otherwise documented, the following assumptions apply: — The current and wave-induced flow components at the pipe level are statistically independent. — The current and wave-induced flow components are assumed co-linear. This implies that the directional probability of occurrence data for either waves or current (the most conservative with respect to fatigue damage) must be used for both waves and current. 2.5 ULS criterion 2.5.1 Local buckling check for a pipeline free span shall be in compliance with the combined loading – load controlled condition criteria in DNV-OS-F101, Sec.5 or similar stress-based criteria in a recognised code. Functional and environmental bending moment, axial force and pressure shall be accounted for. Simplifications are allowed provided verification is performed by more advanced modelling/analyses in cases where the ULS criteria become governing. DET NORSKE VERITAS\n\n17. Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F105, February 2006 Page 17 2.5.2 Typically the load effects to be considered in the ULS checks shall be: in − line Vertical direction: — static bending (self weight, seabed profile, etc.) — cross-flow VIV — trawl gear interaction. where — in-line VIV — direct drag and inertia load effects from combined wave and current — trawl gear interaction. Note that different soil stiffnesses should be used for different load directions and load rates (static/dynamic). 2.5.3 For the operating condition the environmental bending moment shall be taken as the most probable 100-year return period value (10-2 annual exceedence probability). For temporary conditions the return period value depends on the seasonal timing and duration of the temporary period. 2.5.4 If more information is not available the following return period values may be applied: — A 100 year return period if the duration exceeds 6 months. — A 10 year return period for the actual seasonal environmental condition if the duration exceeds 3 days but is less than 6 months. — For temporary conditions with duration less than 3 days or operations which can be terminated within a 3 days window, environmental data may be based on reliable weather forecasts. 2.5.5 Environmental events with a given return period require information on joint wave and on-bottom current (and directionality) probabilities. If more detailed information is not available the following cases may be applied (assuming co-linear wave and current flow). (Hs, Tp) 100 year 1 year Uc 1 year 100 year 2.5.6 For extreme wave conditions, which can be assumed to cause large deformations on the span shoulders, detailed analyses of the soil stiffness at the shoulders may be required. In lieu of detailed documentation, the boundary conditions for the free span should be assumed as pinned-pinned (for direct wave load cases). 2.5.7 The maximum environmental bending moment due to in-line and cross-flow VIV or direct wave and current action may be found from the dynamic stresses: ME =σE 2⋅ I Ds − t where σE I Ds T ⎧ A ⎫ 1 max ⎨S IL ; 0.4 ⋅ S CF IL ⎬ + σ FM , max 2 ACF ⎭ ⎩ 1 = S CF 2 σE = cross − flow σ E Horizontal direction: Case 1: Case 2: 2.5.8 The maximum environmental stress, σE, is taken as: Maximum environmental stress given below Moment of inertia Outer diameter of steel pipe Wall thickness SIL In-line stress range, see Sec.4.3 SCF Cross-flow stress range, see Sec.4.4 σFM,max Maximum environmental stress due to direct wave loading, see below AIL In-line unit deflection stress amplitude due to VIV, see Sec.4.3 ACF Cross-flow unit deflection stress amplitude due to VIV, see Sec.4.4 For the cross-flow direction, the stress simply stems from the VIV induced amplitude. For the in-line direction, the dynamic stress range is taken as the maximum of: — the return period stress range for in-line VIV, SIL, defined in 4.3 — the stress from 40% of the CF induced VIV motion. All parameters are defined in Sec.4.4. 2.5.9 Two different methods can be applied to establish the maximum environmental stress, σFM,max (see DNV-OS-F201 for more information): — design based on response statistics — design based on environmental statistics. For free span analysis design based on environmental statistics is considered appropriate using: — a Design Storm approach with irregular wave analysis in time domain (TD) or irregular wave analyses in frequency domain (FD), or — a Design Wave approach using regular wave analysis in TD, i.e., with bending moment calculated from Hmax. 2.5.10 The Design Wave approach may use a set of appropriate design cases (in terms of wave height, wave period, current and directionality) likely to produce the extreme response with a chosen return period. This may be done using a return period value for Hs with a wave period variation covering a realistic variation range (e.g. 90% confidence interval) or using environmental contours. Guidance note: Cases with moderate Hs and large wave period are often governing. Hence more focus should be given to large Tp values. In case of a quasi-static and not dynamically sensitive pipeline response for the ULS condition, the 100-year Hmax value with an associated period could be used to generate the regular wave and corresponding quasi-static response. ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- 2.5.11 The maximum environmental stress, σFM,max, from direct wave loading can be established using a time domain Design Storm approach as follows: 1) Global time domain response analysis is performed for the actual stationary environmental condition. A typical storm duration may be taken as 3 hours. 2) Time histories for the dynamic stress are established 3) A 3-parameter Weibull distribution is fitted to the individual stress maxima between successive mean value crossings σFM(t).

Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F105, February 2006 Page 18 4) A Gumbel distribution is established for the extreme value for the largest individual maxima of σFM(t) for the 3 hour duration. 5) σFM,max is estimated as the p-percentile in the Gumbel distribution, i.e., the 57% percentile for the expected value or the Most Probable Maximum value corresponding to a 37% percentile 2.5.12 As a simplified alternative σFM,max may be calculated using: σ FM,max = kp ⋅ kM ⋅σs kp kM 2 ln(f v ∆T ) ⎤ 1⎡σ = 1 + ⎢ s − 1⎥ 2 ⎢ σ s ,I ⎥ ⎣ ⎦ = where kp is a peak factor where ∆T is the storm duration equal to 3 hour and fv is the vibration frequency. σs is the standard deviation of the stress response σFM(t) and σs,I is the standard deviation for the stress response without drag loading. σs and σs,I may be calculated from a time domain or frequency domain analysis, see Sec.5. kM is a factor accounting for non-linearity in the drag loading. A static stress component may be added if relevant. Guidance note: In case the ULS due to direct wave action is found to be governing, the effect of the axial force should be considered. ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- 2.5.13 For temporary conditions extreme environmental conditions, like a 10-year flow velocity sustained for a given time period, may cause fatigue damage to develop. To ensure the integrity of the pipeline and the robustness of the design, such extreme events should be checked. 2.6 Safety factors 2.6.1 The safety factors to be used with the screening criteria are listed below.

Selection criteria for this category are (but not limited to): — erodible seabed (scouring) — environmental conditions given by extreme values only — operational conditions change the span scenario and these changes are not assessed in detail, or — span assessment in an early stage of a project development. Well defined – spans where important span characteristics like span length, gap and effective axial force are determined/ measured. Site specific soil conditions and a long-term description of the environmental conditions exist. Very well defined – spans where important span characteristics like span length, gap and effective axial force are determined/ measured with a high degree of accuracy. The soil conditions and the environmental conditions along the route are well known. Requirements: — span length/gap actually measured and well defined due to span supports or uneven seabed — structural response quantities by FE analysis — soil properties by soil samples along route — site specific long-term distributions of environmental data — effect of changes in operational conditions evaluated in detail. 2.6.4 In case several phases with different safety classes are to be accounted for, the highest safety class is to be applied for all phases as fatigue damage accumulates. 2.6.5 The reliability of the pipeline against local buckling (ULS criterion) is ensured by use of the safety class concept as implemented by use of safety factors according to DNV-OSF101, Sec.5 D500 or Sec.12. 2.6.6 The relationship between the fatigue life, exposure time and fatigue damage is: High 0.25 1.30 D fat , RP − F105 = Texp osure Tlife ⋅η 2.6.7 As stated in DNV-OS-F101 Sec.5 D703, all stress fluctuations imposed to the pipeline including the construction/installation phase shall be accounted for when calculating the DET NORSKE VERITAS\n\n19.

This means that the total accumulated fatigue damage from different sources shall not exceed the allowable damage ratios of DNV-OS-F101. As the allowable damage ratio of DNV-OS-F101 is different from the one in Table 2-2 due to use of partial safety factors in RP-F105, the calculated damage ratio according to RP-F105 may be converted into a corresponding DNV-OS-F101 damage ratio by the following relation: D fat , RP − F 105 D fat ,OS − F 101 = ⋅ α fat η Where the αfat denotes the allowable damage ratio according to DNV-OS-F101. 3. Environmental Conditions 3.1 General 3.1.1 The objective of the present section is to provide guidance on: — the long term current velocity distribution — short-term and long-term description of wave-induced flow velocity amplitude and period of oscillating flow at the pipe level — return period values. 3.1.2 The environmental data to be used in the assessment of the long-term distributions shall be representative for the particular geographical location of the pipeline free span. 3.1.3 The flow conditions due to current and wave action at the pipe level govern the response of free spanning pipelines. 3.1.4 The environmental data must be collected from periods that are representative for the long-term variation of the wave and current climate. In case of less reliable or limited wave and current data, the statistical uncertainty should be assessed and, if significant, included in the analysis. 3.1.5 Preferably, the environmental load conditions should be established near the pipeline using measurement data of acceptable quality and duration. The wave and current characteristics must be transferred (extrapolated) to the free span level and location using appropriate conservative assumptions. 3.2.2 For water depths greater than 100 m, the ocean currents can be characterised in terms of the driving and steering agents: — The driving agents are tidal forces, pressure gradients due to surface elevation or density changes, wind and storm surge forces. — The steering agents are topography and the rotation of the earth. The modelling should account adequately for all agents. 3.2.3 The flow can be divided into two zones: — An Outer Zone far from the seabed where the mean current velocity and turbulence vary only slightly in the horizontal direction. — An Inner Zone where the mean current velocity and turbulence show significant variations in the horizontal direction and the current speed and direction is a function of the local sea bed geometry. 3.2.4 The outer zone is located approximately one local seabed form height above the seabed crest. In case of a flat seabed, the outer zone is located approximately at height (3600 z0) where z0 is the bottom roughness, see Table 3-1. 3.2.5 Current measurements using a current meter should be made in the outer zone outside the boundary layer at a level 12 seabed form heights above the crest. For large-scale currents, such as wind driven and tidal currents, the choice of measurement positions may be based on the variations in the bottom topography assuming that the current is geo-strophic, i.e., mainly running parallel to the large-scale bottom contours. Over smooth hills, flow separation occurs when the hill slope exceeds about 20o. Current data from measurements in the boundary layer over irregular bed forms are of little practical value when extrapolating current values to other locations. 3.2.6 In the inner zone the current velocity profile is approximately logarithmic in areas where flow separation does not occur: U(z) = R c ⋅ U(z r ) 3.1.6 The following environmental description may be applied: where — directional information, i.e., flow characteristic versus sector probability, or — omnidirectional statistics may be used if the flow is uniformly distributed. Rc z zr z0 (ln(z ) − ln(z 0 ) ) (ln(z r ) − ln(z 0 ) ) If no such information is available, the flow should be assumed to act perpendicular to the axis of the pipeline at all times. 3.2 Current conditions 3.2.1 The steady current flow at the free span level may have components from: — — — — tidal current wind induced current storm surge induced current density driven current. Guidance note: The effect of internal waves, which are often observed in parts of South East Asia, need to be taken into account for the free span assessment. The internal waves may have high fluid particle velocity and they can be modelled as equivalent current distributions. ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- reduction factor, see Sec.3.4.1. elevation above the seabed reference measurement height (in the outer zone) bottom roughness parameter to be taken from Table 3-1.

The flow (and macroroughness) is normally 3D and transformation of current characteristics should account for the local bottom topography e.g. be guided by numerical simulations.

It is assumed that the current velocity U(zr) in the outer zone is known, see Figure 3-1. The velocity profile U(z*) at a location near the measuring point (with zr* > zr) may be approximated by: (ln(z *) − ln(z m ) ) U(z*) = U(z r ) ln z * − ln(z m ) r (( ) ) The “macro-roughness” parameter zm is given by: ln(z m ) = ln(z ∗ ) − r (z ∗ r ) − zr + z∗ r zr (ln(z r ) − ln(z o ) ) zm is to be taken less than 0.2.

The wave theory shall be capable of describing the conditions at the pipe location, including effects due to shallow water, if applicable. For most practical cases, linear wave theory can be applied. Wave boundary layer effects can normally be neglected. 3.3.2 The short-term, stationary, irregular sea states may be described by a wave spectrum Sηη(ω) i.e. the power spectral density function of the sea surface elevation. Wave spectra may be given in table form, as measured spectra, or in an analytical form. 3.3.3 The JONSWAP or the Pierson-Moskowitz spectra are often appropriate.

Experience indicates that the turbulence intensity for macro-roughness areas is 20-40% higher than the intensity over a flat seabed with the same small-scale seabed roughness. The turbulence intensities in a rough seabed area to be applied for in-line fatigue assessment may conservatively be taken as typical turbulence intensities over a flat bottom (at the same height) with similar small-scale seabed roughness. 3.2.13 Detailed turbulence measurements, if deemed essential, should be made at 1 m and 3 m above the seabed. High frequency turbulence (with periods lower than 1 minute) and low frequency turbulence must be distinguished. 5 ϕ ≤ 3.6 ⎧ ⎪ γ = ⎨exp(5.75 − 1.15ϕ ) 3.6 < ϕ < 5 ; ⎪ 1 ϕ ≥5 ⎩ ϕ= Tp HS where Hs is to be given in metres and Tp in seconds.

However, moderate and low sea states, not dominated by limited fetch, are often composed of both wind-sea and swell. A two peak (bi-modal) spectrum should be considered to account for swell if considered important. 3.3.5 The wave-induced velocity spectrum at the pipe level SUU(ω) may be obtained through a spectral transformation of the waves at sea level using a first order wave theory: 3.2.14 The current speed in the vicinity of a platform may be reduced from the specified free stream velocity, due to hydro- DET NORSKE VERITAS S UU (ω ) = G 2 (ω ) ⋅ Sηη (ω )\n\n21.

Introducing the effect of directionality, the reduction factor, Rc becomes: Rc = sin(θ rel ) where θrel is the relative direction between the pipeline direction and the current flow direction. 3.4.2 In case of combined wave and current flow the apparent seabed roughness is increased by the non-linear interaction between wave and current flow. The modified velocity profile and hereby-introduced reduction factor may be taken from DNV-RP-E305. 3.4.3 The effect of wave directionality and wave spreading is introduced in the form of a reduction factor on the significant flow velocity, i.e. projection onto the velocity normal to the pipe and effect of wave spreading. 3.3.6 The spectral moments of order n is defined as: ∞ M n = ∫ ω n SUU (ω )dω 0 U W = U S ⋅ RD The following spectrally derived parameters appear: The reduction factor is given by, see Figure 3-4. — Significant flow velocity amplitude at pipe level: US = 2 M0 — Mean zero up-crossing period of oscillating flow at pipe level: Tu =2π M0 M2 US and Tu may be taken from Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3 assuming linear wave theory. π /2 RD = 3.4.4 The wave energy spreading (directional) function given by a frequency independent cosine power function is: ⎧ ⎪k cos s ( β ) w( β ) = ⎨ w ⎪ 0 ⎩ Tn = (h / g)0.5 USTn / HS 0.00 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 Tn / Tp 0.8 Reduction factor R D Tu / Tp 2 ; 1.0 1.3 γ = 5.0 γ = 1.0 0.6 1.0 s=2 s=4 s=6 s = 1000 0.4 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.00 else ⎛ s⎞ Γ⎜1 + ⎟ ⎝ 2⎠ kw = π ⎛1 s⎞ Γ⎜ + ⎟ ⎝2 2⎠ 1 ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e--- 1.4 1.1 π Guidance note: Cases with large Hs and large Tp values may have a lower spread.

The Weibull distribution is given by: where F(•) is the cumulative distribution function and α is the scale, β is the shape and γ is the location parameter. Note that the Rayleigh distribution is obtained for β = 2 and an Exponential distribution for β = 1.

Each short-term sea state may be characterised by Hs, Tp, and the main wave direction θ, measured relative to a given reference direction The directional (i.e. versus θ) or omni-directional significant wave height may be specified as follows: — A scatter diagram in terms of Hs, Tp, θ. The fatigue analysis is based on the discrete sea-states reflected in the individual cells in the scatter diagram. — A histogram in terms of (Hs, θ) versus probability of occurrence. The time between independent events depends on the environmental condition. For currents, this time is often taken as 24 hours, whereas the time between independent sea-states (described by Hs) normally may be taken as 3-6 hours. 3.6.2 For a Weibull distributed variable the return period value is given by: x c = α (ln(N )) 1/ β +γ 3.6.3 In case the statistics are given in terms of a scatter diagram, a long term Weibull distribution (α, β, γ) is established from 3.5.1 using statistical moments derived directly from the scatter diagram as follows: µ = ∑ (H s ) ⋅ PH S HS σ = ∑ (H − µ ) ⋅ P ∑ (H − µ ) ⋅ P 2 s HS HS 3 s δ = HS HS σ3 where PHs is the discrete occurrence probability. The same principle applies for current histograms. 3.6.4 The return period value to be used for directional data is taken as the maximum projected flow velocity, i.e.: max (x c,i ⋅ R D (θ rel,i ) / R D (θ rel = 0) ) i =1..n where RD is a reduction factor defined by 3.4.3, θrel,i is the relative direction between the pipeline direction and the flow direction for direction i.

Response Models 4.1 General 4.1.1 Amplitude response models are empirical models providing the maximum steady state VIV amplitude response as a function of the basic hydrodynamic and structural parameters. The response models provided herein have been derived based on available experimental laboratory test data and a limited amount of full-scale tests for the following conditions: — in-line VIV in steady current and current dominated conditions — cross-flow VIV induced in-line motion — cross-flow VIV in steady current and combined wave and current conditions. The response models are in agreement with the generally accepted concept of VIV. 4.1.2 In the response models, in-line and cross-flow vibrations are considered separately. Damage contributions from both first and second in-line instability regions in current dominated conditions are implicit in the in-line model. Cross-flow induced additional in-line VIV resulting in possible increased fatigue damage is considered in an approximate way. Cross-flow induced in-line VIV is relevant for all reduced velocity ranges where cross-flow VIV occurs. KS = where ρ ζT me Water density Total modal damping ratio Effective mass, see Sec.6.7.3. 4.1.9 The total modal damping ratio, ζT, comprises: — structural damping, ζstr, see Sec.6.2.11 — soil damping, ζsoil. For screening purposes ζsoil = 0.01 may be assumed. For details, see 7.3.1 — hydrodynamic damping, ζh. For VIV within the lock-in region, the hydrodynamic modal damping ratio ζh is normally to be taken as zero, i.e. ζh = 0.00. 4.2 Marginal fatigue life capacity 4.2.1 For cross-flow VIV, the marginal fatigue capacity against VIV in a single sea-state characterised by (Hs, Tp, θ) is defined by, see Sec.2.4: 4.1.3 In case of multi-mode response, i.e. when several vibration modes may be excited simultaneously in the same direction (in-line or cross-flow), the computational procedure given in Appendix A accounts for possible reductions in the response amplitude. 4.1.4 The amplitude response depends on a set of hydrodynamic parameters constituting the link between the environmental data and the Response Models: — — — — — — reduced velocity, VR Keulegan-Carpenter number, KC current flow velocity ratio, α; turbulence intensity, Ic, see 3.2.11 flow angle, relative to the pipe, θrel stability parameter, KS.

In addition, an onset safety factor is needed, see Sec.2.6. DET NORSKE VERITAS ---e-n-d---of---G-u-i-d-a-n-c-e---n-o-t-e---"
