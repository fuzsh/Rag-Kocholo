        "text": "The pile capacity refers to the maximum load that can be borne by a pile under load, to ensure that strength and stability of foundation soil and pile itself can be guaranteed and the deformation is within the allowable range.\n\nPile foundation has been widely used in offshore engineering due to its high strength, large bearing capacity, and good durability (Kellezi and Hansen 2003). Like other foundation systems, strength and deformation are the two most important aspects that should be considered in design. That is, the pile foundation should be designed with high enough bearing capacity to carry the loads and without having excessive deformations at the same time. In this entry, bearing capacity of the pile foundation under both axial and lateral loads in..."
