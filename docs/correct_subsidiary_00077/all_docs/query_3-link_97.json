        "meta_description": "Abstract. The need for cost-effective support structure designs for offshore wind turbines has led to continued interest in the\ndevelopment of design optimization methods. So far, almost no studies have considered the effect of uncertainty, and\nhence probabilistic constraints, on the support structure design optimization problem. In this work, we present a\ngeneral methodology that implements recent developments in gradient-based design optimization, in particular the use\nof analytical gradients, within the context of reliability-based design optimization methods. Gradient-based\noptimization is typically more efficient and has more well-defined convergence properties than gradient-free methods,\nmaking this the preferred paradigm for reliability-based optimization where possible. By an assumed factorization of\nthe uncertain response into a design-independent, probabilistic part and a design-dependent but completely\ndeterministic part, it is possible to computationally decouple the reliability analysis from the design\noptimization. Furthermore, this decoupling makes no further assumption about the functional nature of the stochastic\nresponse, meaning that high-fidelity surrogate modeling through Gaussian process regression of the probabilistic part\ncan be performed while using analytical gradient-based methods for the design optimization. We apply this methodology\nto several different cases based around a uniform cantilever beam and the OC3 Monopile and different loading and\nconstraint scenarios. The results demonstrate the viability of the approach in terms of obtaining reliable, optimal\nsupport structure designs and furthermore show that in practice only a limited amount of additional computational\neffort is required compared to deterministic design optimization. While there are some limitations in the applied\ncases, and some further refinement might be necessary for applications to high-fidelity design scenarios, the\ndemonstrated capabilities of the proposed methodology show that efficient reliability-based optimization for offshore\nwind turbine support structures is feasible.",

        "text": "Offshore wind energy is becoming an increasingly competitive alternative to the traditional land-based wind farms. However, there remains a level of additional cost which, together with some practical challenges, ensures that offshore wind is still a secondary consideration in many markets. Hence, the reduction of this cost is a primary objective in current research and development. Cost reduction is generally a multidisciplinary issue, including turbine components like rotor blades and the drivetrain, wind farm layout, the electrical grid and the design of the support structure (including the tower). Methods to derive cost-effective, optimal support structure designs â balancing minimal use of materials (and potentially other cost-driving design aspects) with the ability to safely withstand the loads required by design standards â have been an active area of research for many years. However, very few studies have taken into account the probabilistic, fundamentally uncertain aspects of the design process. This includes, for example, uncertainties in the environment and the modeling of the environment, affecting the loads experienced by the structure, as well as uncertainties about the details of the design itself, affecting the response to the applied loads. Taking such uncertainties into account generally requires the use of probabilistic mathematical methods that severely complicate the design optimization problem that needs to be solved, both formally and numerically. Hence, deterministic safety factors tend to be used. This is also true even for single design assessments. The present study aims to address these issues by proposing a methodology that allows the use of both state-of-the-art optimization methods recently developed for support structure design and probabilistic assessments of the structural response to both fatigue and extreme loads.\n\nDesign optimization of structures subject to probabilistic problem variables and parameters, sometimes called optimization under uncertainty, is in general a large field of research at the intersection of two larger fields, optimization and probabilistic design. One main distinction is between robust design optimization (RBO) (Ben-Tal etÂ al.,Â 2009; Zang etÂ al.,Â 2005) and reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) (Choi etÂ al.,Â 2007; Valdebenito and SchuÃ«ller,Â 2010a). The main difference between the two methods is that in RBDO the design is optimized normally but under specific probabilistic limits on structural performance (probability of failure), whereas in RBO the basic idea is to minimize the variance of a probabilistic objective function in order that the obtained (mean) solution is robust with respect to the uncertainties. We will generally restrict our discussion to RBDO and reliability methods but refer to studies on RBO and robust methods where necessary or appropriate. Furthermore, given the extensive research on more general applications of reliability analysis, optimization and RBDO (or optimization under uncertainty more generally), we will focus on previous studies concerning wind turbines. For a more expansive overview of structural reliability and RBDO applied to wind turbines than the one following below, the interested reader is referred to Jiang etÂ al. (2017), Leimeister and Kolios (2018), HÃ¼bler (2019) and Hu (2018).\n\nA substantial amount of the literature for both structural reliability analyses and RBDO of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) has focused on aspects other than support structure design. Areas such as blade design (Ronold etÂ al.,Â 1999; Toft and SÃ¸rensen,Â 2011; Dimitrov,Â 2013; Hu etÂ al.,Â 2016; Caboni etÂ al.,Â 2018), foundation design (Yoon etÂ al.,Â 2014; Carswell etÂ al.,Â 2015; Depina etÂ al.,Â 2016, 2017; Haj etÂ al.,Â 2019; Velarde etÂ al.,Â 2019), component design (Kostandyan and SÃ¸rensen,Â 2011; Rafsanjani etÂ al.,Â 2017; Lee etÂ al.,Â 2014; Li etÂ al.,Â 2017), system/wind farm aspects (SÃ¸rensen etÂ al.,Â 2008), inspection and maintenance planning, and probabilistic tuning/optimization of safety factors (SÃ¸rensen and Tarp-Johansen,Â 2005; MÃ¡rquez-DomÃ­nguez and SÃ¸rensen,Â 2012; Veldkamp,Â 2008) have all been studied. As for support structure design specifically, though most structural analyses of OWTs remain deterministic, there has been a number of studies incorporating reliability-based (or otherwise probabilistic) approaches. For the most part, the reliability-based analyses can be divided into two categories. Firstly, there are studies using simplified probabilistic models where the uncertainty in the response is assumed to be a product of the underlying stochastic variables and the deterministic response variable (e.g., ThÃ¶ns etÂ al.,Â 2010; SÃ¸rensen and Toft,Â 2010; Wandji etÂ al.,Â 2016; Yeter etÂ al.,Â 2016, as well as several of the previously cited studies). Note that the basis for this kind of factorization can be justified partially or entirely depending on both the type of response variable and the type of stochastic variable. For example, in the case of Yeter etÂ al. (2016), the stochastic variables are mostly either modeling or simulation errors, or directly originating within the analytical expressions for the response variable. Hence, the level of approximation involved in this kind of probabilistic modeling varies. While not strictly in the same category, studies where the fatigue calculation is based on crack propagation models and an assumption that the stress cycles follow a Weibull distribution, allowing exact limit state expressions to be derived, should be mentioned (e.g., Dong etÂ al.,Â 2012). Generally, these simplifications are done in order to be able to solve the reliability problem using first-/second-order reliability methods (FORMs/SORMs) in a computationally feasible way. In the second category of studies, the response itself is simplified, while generally no particular assumptions about the stochastic nature of the response are made. This has been done through static response modeling (e.g., Wei etÂ al.,Â 2014; Kim and Lee,Â 2015), but usually the response is replaced by surrogate models of some kind (e.g., Kolios,Â 2010; Teixeira etÂ al.,Â 2017; MoratÃ³ etÂ al.,Â 2019). The use of surrogate models is often done in order to be able to solve the reliability problem by sampling methods, generally requiring a large number of response evaluations, but surrogate models also make FORM/SORM more computationally practical. Note that this division of reliability methodology is not strict â ThÃ¶ns etÂ al. (2010) also makes use of surrogate modeling, for example â nor does it cover all approaches, but it is useful as an indicator for one of the fundamental struggles that all the aforementioned studies have reckoned with: the fidelity of the probabilistic modeling vs. the fidelity of the underlying structural analysis.\n\nOnly a limited number of studies applying RBDO to OWT support structure design have been made. In a series of studies, Yang and collaborators investigated optimization of a tripod support structure with probabilistic constraints. In Yang etÂ al. (2015), RBDO was performed, and in Yang and Zhu (2015), RBO was performed. In both cases, a Gaussian process (kriging) surrogate model was used for the response and Monte Carlo sampling was used for the reliability calculation. In Yang etÂ al. (2018), RBDO was once again performed with a Gaussian process surrogate model, but in this case the reliability calculation was done using a fractional moment method in order to reduce the number of system evaluations required. All three studies used the heuristic optimization method called the multi-island genetic algorithm, and the reliability calculations were done for each step in the optimization loop, creating a nested two-loop structure. As one might expect from a heuristic method, the number of iterations required to solve even the deterministic optimization problem (around 300 iterations) is rather large given the small number of design variables used, and this is much more pronounced in the case of the stochastic optimization (around 3000 iterations). This means that the method is rather computationally inefficient, especially considering the number of system evaluations required by the reliability calculation and the genetic algorithm at each iteration. However, due to the use of the surrogate model, this practical issue is overcome, if still apparent. Though not an application to OWTs, it is also worth mentioning the study of RBDO applied to offshore monopod towers in Karadeniz etÂ al. (2010b) and applied to jacket structures in Karadeniz etÂ al. (2010a). Here, the limit state functions are formulated analytically, and a nested two-loop approach using gradient-based optimization (in this case sequential quadratic programming, SQP) and FORM is used.\n\nThe previous work on RBDO for OWTs (for both support structures and otherwise) demonstrates that these methods can obtain optimal designs that are both more robust/safe with respect to uncertainties than designs optimized under deterministic criteria and more tailored to specific design conditions than deterministic designs using safety factors. However, so far (and this is particularly true for support structure designs), no studies have taken advantage of recent advances in deterministic structural optimization methodology. Optimization methods in general can be divided into gradient-based and gradient-free (often heuristic) methods. Both approaches have been applied to support structure design and other wind turbine components (both on- and offshore). With some exceptions (e.g., Negm and Maalawi,Â 2000 using an interior penalty method), gradient-free methods were the most common among earlier studies. Examples include Yoshida (2006) using a genetic algorithm, Uys etÂ al. (2007) with a Rosenbrock search and Zwick etÂ al. (2012) with a local scaling of sectional members. The advantages of these approaches are that no gradient information is needed for the optimization, which simplifies the calculations that need to be performed for each iteration and avoids the reliance on finite difference methods, which can be unstable in some implementations. On the other hand, these methods, at least when done at a similar level of detail, generally converge much slower than gradient-based alternatives, where the search for optimal designs can be more specifically guided by the information provided by the gradients. With this disadvantage of gradient-free methods in mind, and seeking to avoid the issues related to finite difference methods, some recent studies have demonstrated the viability and, in most cases, advantages of analytical sensitivities in gradient-based formulations. This has been shown for static (Sandal etÂ al.,Â 2018), quasi-static (Oest etÂ al.,Â 2017) and dynamic (Chew etÂ al.,Â 2016) loading conditions (see also Oest etÂ al.,Â 2018 for a comparison of these three approaches and a more thorough review of support structure optimization). In general, these approaches make the design optimization problem more efficient and stable, though, because of the added conceptual complications, these methods have yet to be applied in studies considering a more realistic and comprehensive set of loading conditions. A study founded on gradient-based optimization that does consider a more comprehensive set of loading conditions but does not utilize analytical sensitivities was performed by HÃ¤fele etÂ al. (2019). They used a Gaussian process surrogate model to simplify the response, thus making the analysis computationally feasible. This study also used a more complicated and (arguably) more realistic objective function, modeling the cost of the support structure in a more detailed way than the strictly steel mass-/volume-based approaches that are otherwise commonly used. However, it was seen that, at least with the particular cost formulations used, the solution was more or less the same as when a simpler mass-based objective function was used. Another recent study regarding deterministic support structure optimization was done in Couceiro etÂ al. (2019). Like the previous study, completely analytical sensitivities were not used. The plausibility of more comprehensive code checks for design optimization under dynamic loading was in this case demonstrated by a simplified fatigue extrapolation procedure and an aggregation of time-dependent stress constraints (for ultimate limit state analysis) into a single constraint per stress time series. All these studies have been focused on bottom-fixed structures (jackets in particular, though the methodologies are easily transferable to monopiles) and it is unclear what level of adaptation is necessary to extend these formulations to floating structures.\n\nAs seen in several of the cited studies above, the use of surrogate modeling to simplify the response analysis has become more common recently. For optimization and reliability analysis, and all the more so for RBDO, this is a natural way to make the problems more computationally tractable when faced with having to perform a large number of time-consuming simulations. However, surrogate modeling is increasingly also proposed for basic structural analysis due to the large number of environmental states that need to be checked for certification according to design standards (e.g., International Electrotechnical Commission,Â 2009). For example, Toft etÂ al. (2016a) used a response surface based on Taylor expansions, and Gaussian process regression was used by Huchet etÂ al. (2019) and Teixeira etÂ al. (2019) for fatigue design and by Abdallah etÂ al. (2019) for ultimate limit state (ULS) design. Though there are some challenges regarding the number of samples required to build an accurate model, this can be alleviated by efficient design of experiment and/or adaptive methods. The overall indication seems to be that surrogate modeling, and particularly Gaussian process regression, provides a viable strategy for simplifying the structural analysis in design problems.\n\nIn summary, while considerable work has gone into improving the various analyses and methods involved in RBDO for support structures, there is a very limited amount of studies that connect these pieces together. In particular, the work on analytical design sensitivities has not been implemented into RBDO, nor has it been combined with surrogate modeling approaches that make more comprehensive structural analysis and/or reliability analysis computationally feasible. These gaps are what we intend to explore in the present study. By a very particular formulation of the probabilistic constraints (limit state functions) used for the support structure design optimization, we demonstrate how these constraints can remain analytically differentiable with respect to the design variables while at the same time using a surrogate model for the stochastic variation of the response. By doing so, we retain the advantages of the state-of-the-art deterministic optimization formulations while ensuring that the uncertainties are propagated through the system in a way that makes less simplifications than the commonly used factorization approaches and without incurring substantial additional computational effort. By assuming that some kind of factorization of the response is valid locally in design space, a standard double-loop RBDO formulation can be applied together with a design-independent Gaussian process surrogate model that makes the inner loop used to solve the reliability problem computationally insignificant. Retraining the surrogate model and repeating the optimization a few additional times then leads to convergence and an optimal design that is feasible with respect to uncertainties in both the loads and the structural modeling. In addition to incorporating more advanced optimization methods to the RBDO problem than has been done previously for OWT support structure design, the current approach can also be seen as a natural middle ground between, on the one hand, the simplified analytical limit state formulations and, on the other hand, the completely surrogate-model-based limit state formulations, the two most commonly used approaches in reliability analysis and RBDO for OWTs previously.\n\nThe structure of the paper from this point on is as follows. In the first section (methodology), the general theoretical background is presented first, with focus on optimization, reliability analysis and RBDO, but some details about surrogate modeling are also included. The section is concluded with a motivation and presentation of the proposed method from a general point of view. The next section (testing and implementation details) describes the setup for how we have chosen to test the method in practice. This includes specific models and what kinds of loads are included, the type of constraints included in the optimization, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty modeling. Additionally, some particular practical details of how the method has been implemented are discussed. The remaining sections of the paper include a presentation and discussion of the results, in the results section; more detailed treatment of a few points of interest, in the further discussion section; and a summary and final thoughts, in the conclusions.\n\nIn the following, we present the basic framework of (deterministic) design optimization for OWT support structures. Then, some aspects of RBDO and surrogate modeling are explained. Finally, the synthesis of these aspects resulting in the proposed RBDO methodology is motivated and presented.\n\n2.1âDesign optimization of offshore wind turbine support structures\n\nFor the task of finding the minimum structural mass fmass of a topologically fixed design consisting of N circular cross sections, the following optimization problem can be formulated:\n\n(1) min x f mass ( x ) such that A lin x â¤ b x â¤ x u x â¥ x l c j ( x ) â¤ 0 â j â J .\n\nHere, x are the design variables, Alin and b give rise to a system of linear inequality constraints, xu and xl are upper and lower bounds, respectively, and cj represents a non-linear constraint function indexed according to some set ð¥. The design variables for this problem will be the diameters Di and thicknesses ti of each cross section iâ{1,â¦,N} . The total mass of all N cross sections is calculated as\n\n(2) f mass ( x = ( D ; t ) ) = Ï Ï â i = 1 N L i ( D i t i - t i 2 ) ,\n\nwhere Li represents the (constant) length of each structural element with cross sections given by Di and ti, and Ï is the material density (assuming a uniform density throughout the structure). Examples of the type of linear constraints that can be represented by Alinxâ¤b are limits on the ratio of each Di to each ti (the Dât ratio). The non-linear constraint cj typically corresponds to safety criteria for ULS and the fatigue limit state (FLS) but often also includes constraints on the first eigenfrequency of the structure.\n\nThe optimization problem in Eq.Â (1) can be solved either by gradient-based or gradient-free (heuristic) methods. All gradient-based methods require, as the name suggests, the calculation of the gradients of the problem. In a constrained problem like Eq.Â (1), that means estimating the gradients of both the objective function fmass and all the constraints. For an objective function like the one stated in Eq.Â (2) and for any linear constraints, this is a trivial problem. For non-linear constraints, the calculation of gradients (often called sensitivities in the optimization field) can be very difficult, especially when the value of these constraints depends on output from simulations, as is generally the case for support structure optimization. This difficulty can in principle be accommodated by the use of finite difference methods, where the function values around the current design point are used to get an estimate of the gradient. However, the use of finite difference methods can lead to inaccurate solutions or failure to converge, or will at least often require a larger number of function evaluations (computationally costly when simulations are needed for each such evaluation) to obtain the same solution as one would using the exact gradients (see, e.g., Chew etÂ al.,Â 2016). Additionally, the accuracy of finite difference estimates depends strongly on the chosen step size, the optimal value of which again depends strongly on the (possibly local) properties of the function in question (see, e.g., Press etÂ al.,Â 2007 for a general discussion and Oest etÂ al.,Â 2017 for a demonstration of this effect for support structure design). Hence, it is desirable to use analytical sensitivities whenever possible. Examples of common heuristic methods are genetic algorithms, particle swarm algorithms and random search. The reason that these methods might be used over gradient-based methods is that no estimation of sensitivities is necessary in that case, seemingly avoiding the problem described above related to gradient estimation. However, as a trade-off, these gradient-free methods generally require a much larger number of iterations to convergence to the solution, since the methodology is typically founded on some kind of loosely guided (possibly random) search of the parameter space. While being able to overcome some of the weaknesses of gradient-based optimization, for simulation-based problems, the resulting added computational expense of heuristic methods might not be acceptable in practice. Since the gradient-based methods using analytical sensitivities are able to avoid the numerical issues associated with finite differences and obtain accurate gradient information, these methods are consequently preferable. Hence, we shall focus our attention on gradient-based methods from this point onwards.\n\nIt is a well-known result (see, e.g., Kang etÂ al.,Â 2006) that when the displacements u(t) of the structural system under dynamic loading S(t) are found by time integration of the equation of motion, given as\n\n(3) M ( x ) u Â¨ ( t ) + C ( x ) u Ë ( t ) + K ( x ) u ( t ) = S ( t ) ,\n\nfor mass matrix M, damping matrix C and stiffness matrix K, then the sensitivities of the displacements can be found by time integration of the following equation:\n\n(4) M ( x ) d u Â¨ ( t ) d x + C ( x ) d u Ë ( t ) d x + K ( x ) d u ( t ) d x = d S ( t ) d x - d M ( x ) d x u Â¨ ( t ) + d C ( x ) d x u Ë ( t ) + d K ( x ) d x u ( t ) .\n\nHence, if the non-linear constraints can be expressed as analytical functions of the displacements, the sensitivities are obtainable via (possibly repeated) application of the chain rule and finally the solution of Eq.Â (4). It is presently assumed that the system matrices (M, C and K) are known analytical functions of the design variables, as is the case when the structural analysis is based on finite element modeling with beam elements defined according to Euler or Timoschenko beam theory. If this is not the case, the use of semi-analytical methods (where the gradients of the system matrices are estimated with finite differences) must be used. For OWT support structures, it was shown in Chew etÂ al. (2016) how the sensitivities of both ULS and FLS constraints could be obtained using the analytical approach described above.\n\n2.2âRBDO\n\nThe main distinguishing feature, with respect to the problem structure defined in Eq.Â (1), of optimization under uncertainty, is the addition of a new set of stochastic variables Î¸ that in general can enter both the objective function and the constraints. In fact, some or all of the design variables in x could be replaced (or depend on) variables in Î¸. However, in our case, we shall restrict the discussion to cases where all the design variables are deterministic. It follows that the only Î¸ dependence must then be in the so far to be determined non-linear constraints cj. In RBDO, the main idea is that we seek to constrain (and/or, in some formulations, optimize) the reliability of the system. The reliability of a structural system is a probabilistic measure of its ability to resist loads. In the most straightforward mathematical representation, this is expressed as the extent to which the load effect Q (usually depending on the response) does not exceed the resistance R (usually depending on the capacity or structural strength). In a probabilistic setting, this is quantified by the probability of failure Pf, defined as\n\n(5) P f = Prob ( Q - R > 0 ) .\n\nFormally, the reliability is the probability of non-failure, 1âPf, though commonly one tends to use Pf rather than the actual reliability in analysis and calculations. Furthermore, since the analogy of load effect and resistance is not always applicable, the notion of failure is usually represented by a limit state function g, encoding failure as positive function values, with the probability of failure as\n\n(6) P f = Prob ( g > 0 ) .\n\nIn general, g is a function of both x and Î¸, and to calculate Pf requires knowledge of the joint probability distribution hÎ¸ of all the stochastic variables in Î¸. An exact estimate of Pf is then given by the integral of hÎ¸ over the part of its domain where g>0, i.e.,\n\n(7) P f = â« g ( x , Î¸ ) > 0 h Î¸ ( Î¸ â² ) d Î¸ â² .\n\nThe general RBDO problem may then be formalized as\n\n(8) min x f mass ( x ) such that A lin x â¤ b x â¤ x u x â¥ x l c j ( x ) â¤ 0 â j â J det P f , j ( x ) â¤ P f , j max â j â J prob ,\n\nwhere ð¥det and ð¥prob represent the indices of deterministic and probabilistic constraints, respectively, and Pf,jmax are the desired upper bounds on the probabilities of failure Pf,j.\n\nHowever, for any but the most trivial limit state functions, the determination of the values of x and Î¸ giving g>0, and hence the determination of the integral in Eq.Â (7), cannot be done exactly. The most straightforward and robust way to accommodate this is through the use of sampling methods. In particular, the family of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods is typically used. These methods generally have the property that for a large enough sample size, the resulting estimate Pf^ tends towards the exact value of Pf. Unfortunately, large enough can be an intractable requirement. While the use of variance reduction techniques can speed up the convergence, as the dimensionality and complexity of the problem grows, the number of samples does too. This can be particularly problematic when one or more simulations are required for each sample. Furthermore, sampling methods do not naturally lend themselves well to gradient-based optimization due to the additional effort involved in the calculation of the gradients of a quantity estimated by sampling. In some cases, when the design variables are stochastic, the use of what is called score functions for the estimation of design sensitivity is possible, in which case no additional samples are needed (see, e.g., Hu,Â 2018). At the very least, no analytical gradients can be obtained. Hence, it is common to make use of first- and second-order approximations of the limit state function, making integration over the g>0 region feasible.\n\n2.2.1âFORM\n\nThe objective of FORM is to approximate the non-linear failure surface, the set of points such that g>0, by a linear function of independent standard normal variables v, derived from the original set of stochastic variables Î¸. Historically, there have been several versions of FORM and related methods (see, e.g., Choi etÂ al.,Â 2007 and Enevoldsen and SÃ¸rensen,Â 1994, where also more details about FORM in general can be found), but we shall restrict the discussion to the one most commonly used. The main idea is as follows: construct the set of independent standard normal variables v={vi} by applying the transformations\n\n(9) v i = Î¦ - 1 ( H Î¸ i ( Î¸ i ) ) â i â I ,\n\nwhere Î¦â1 is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), HÎ¸i is the CDF of Î¸i, and â is the set of all the indices for the stochastic variables in Î¸. This particular transformation assumes that the variables in Î¸ are independent, which is not always the case. For non-independent stochastic variables, a slightly more involved transformation (e.g., the Rosenblatt transformation; Rosenblatt,Â 1952) must be used. By substituting v for Î¸ in g, we obtain g(x,v). We want to linearize this function at the point on the boundary between failure and non-failure, g=0, that is closest to the origin in standard normal space, the most probable point (MPP) on the failure surface. This can be found by solving the following optimization problem:\n\n(10) min v â i v i 2 such that g ( x , v ) = 0 .\n\nWe denote the optimal point solving the above v*, and the corresponding minimal distance to the origin Î²=âi(vi*)2 is called the reliability index. The probability of failure is then estimated as Pf=Î¦(-Î²) . Some care must be taken in the application of FORM methods, since this representation is only exact in the case that g is a linear function. For a non-linear g, FORM is an approximation, but it is often good enough for many engineering applications. Beyond merely offering a tractable solution to Eq.Â (7), there are several properties that make FORM desirable for RBDO. Consider, for example, the behavior of the probabilistic constraints in Eq.Â (8). Pf will tend to vary over many orders of magnitude, which can be detrimental to the behavior of many algorithms for gradient-based optimization. The introduction of the reliability index means that we can replace the constraints involving Pf with equivalent ones involving Î², i.e.,\n\n(11) Î² j â¤ Î² j max = - Î¦ - 1 ( P f , j max ) .\n\nThis substitution has a further advantage when calculating sensitivities. Even without an explicit expression for the derivative of Pf with respect to x, we can make the following observation. In the two cases where the design x is such that the region g>0 is either very small (very safe designs) or very large (very unsafe designs), the change in Pf due to a small change in x is virtually zero. Hence, in these design configurations, the sensitivity vanishes, which has a detrimental effect on the optimization since most algorithms will struggle to find new candidate points that lead to measurable changes in the constraints. Using Î² as the constraint function instead gives the following, generally non-vanishing, expression (Enevoldsen and SÃ¸rensen,Â 1994):\n\n(12) d Î² d x = 1 d g d v d g d x .\n\nHowever, one problem with the definition of FORM given in Eq.Â (10), typically called the reliability index approach (RIA), is that it is not always possible to find a configuration v such that g=0 (within a sufficiently small tolerance). This can lead to slower convergence of the RBDO problem or in the worst cases a lack of convergence at all. To resolve this issue, it is possible to formulate an inverse problem where instead of calculating the reliability index for a given design, one finds the configuration of v giving the smallest exceedance of g>0 for a given (fixed) reliability index. This is called the performance measure approach (PMA) and will be explicated below.\n\n2.2.2âPMA\n\nThe main idea of PMA is to reverse the role of objective and constraint in Eq.Â (10). If we demand that âivi2=Î²max as a constraint, we can instead find the largest possible value of g for which that constraint is satisfied. In other words,\n\n(13) max v g ( x , v ) such that â i v i 2 = Î² max .\n\nIf we again call the solution point v* and term the corresponding value of g as g*, then, under the assumptions of the validity of FORM, it follows that Prob(g>g*)=Pfmax . Hence, by further demanding that g*â¤0 , we can guarantee that Pfâ¤Pfmax . The optimization problem in Eq.Â (13) always has a solution. Aside from the robustness provided by this, PMA has a few other advantages. For example, it can be shown that (see, e.g., Frangopol and Maute,Â 2005)\n\n(14) d g ( x , v * ) d x = â g ( x , v * ) â x ,\n\nwhich simplifies the sensitivity analysis. More generally, for applications to RBDO, PMA tends to perform better (Tu etÂ al.,Â 1999; Youn and Choi,Â 2003; Lee etÂ al.,Â 2002). An illustration of the difference between RIA and PMA is made in Fig.Â 1.\n\nThe RBDO problem using PMA can be stated as\n\n(15) min x f mass ( x ) such that A lin x â¤ b x â¤ x u x â¥ x l c j ( x ) â¤ 0 â j â J det g j ( x , v * ) â¤ 0 â j â J prob .\n\nwhere each gj solves Eq.Â (13) with Î²max=-Î¦-1(Pf,jmax) . One potential downside of PMA is that it does not provide a direct estimate of the probability of failure. This is fine for optimization, where being below the threshold is sufficient and where at least one constraint should be at the boundary where g*=0 for the final solution. However, if one wishes to compare the probability of failure of such an optimized design with the corresponding initial design or a design optimized by deterministic methods, then PMA does not immediately provide a quantitative answer. It only provides a qualitative assessment of whether or not the probability of failure is above or below the given threshold. To get a quantitative assessment in these cases, we can exploit the approximate linearity of g*, especially close to g*=0 . If we have solved the PMA problem in Eq.Â (13) once for a target reliability Î²t, obtaining the solution g*, we can then use the secant method to construct an estimate of Î²0â¡Î²(g*=0) as\n\n(16) Î² 0 = Î² t - Î² t - Î² â² g * - g â² * g * ,\n\nwhere gâ²* is the solution of a PMA problem for a target reliability Î²â²â(Î²t,Î²0) . If the initial g* is sufficiently small (close to 0) and/or sufficiently linear, then the above will provide a good estimate Î²0 and hence an estimate of the probability of failure as Pf=Î¦(-Î²0) . Otherwise, this procedure can be iterated (setting Î²t=Î²â² and Î²â²=Î²0 ). In such cases, unless the initial g* is very far away from zero and/or g is highly non-linear, only a few more iterations (1â3) should suffice to get at least two digits of accuracy for Pf.\n\n2.2.3âTwo-loop RBDO vs. single-loop RBDO\n\nAs is evident from Eq.Â (15), the current formulation of the RBDO problem consists of two nested loops. One outer optimization problem that solves the design optimization problem under the given constraints and one inner optimization that solves the (PMA) reliability problem to obtain the probabilistic constraints for each iteration. This can be computationally demanding, even when the convergence of the PMA subproblem is accelerated by the use of improved optimization methods like the hybrid mean-value algorithm (Youn etÂ al.,Â 2003). For this reason, several alternative solution strategies for RBDO have been proposed (Valdebenito and SchuÃ«ller,Â 2010b). This usually involves either decoupling the two loops into a sequence of deterministic optimization and reliability analysis, most prominently in the sequential optimization and reliability analysis (SORA) method (Du and Chen,Â 2004), or the use of reformulated single-loop approaches, most prominently in the aptly named single-loop approach (SLA) (Chen etÂ al.,Â 1997). All these methods involve some kind of approximation of the FORM-based constraint. While speeding up the convergence significantly compared to conventional two-loop strategies, this can also lead to lack of convergence for some problems (Aoues and Chateauneuf,Â 2010). On the other hand, SORA seems to be fairly robust, due in large to the fact that its reliability-based constraint is locally equivalent to the two-loop approach, meaning that as the changes in the design become small from one round of deterministic optimization to the next, the error in the approximation when using a fixed reliability estimate during the design optimization tends to zero.\n\n2.3âSurrogate modeling\n\nSurrogate modeling is generally a vast topic and the interested reader is referred to Wang and Shan (2006) and Marsland (2015) for more general overviews, as well as to Tunga and Demiralp (2005) for the high-dimensional model representation approach and Rasmussen and Williams (2006) and Santner etÂ al. (2018) for more detailed looks at Gaussian process regression (GPR). For applications to RBDO in general, Dubourg (2011) and Jin etÂ al. (2003) are instructive.\n\nFocusing our attention to wind turbine applications, it has been common for quite some time to use surrogate modeling due to the computationally demanding simulations required for time-domain analysis. This is especially true for reliability analysis, optimization and RBDO, due to the drastically increased computational effort involved. The most commonly applied types of surrogate models in wind energy have been response surface models (typically second-order polynomials), Taylor expansions and (especially more recently) GPR. GPR has many advantages, including the ability to capture non-linearities with higher fidelity and providing an estimate of its own uncertainty by default but generally requires a larger number of samples to gain a significant advantage over response surface methods (Kaymaz,Â 2005). We note that GPR is often referred to as kriging in the engineering literature. Although, for most practical purposes, the two terms can be used interchangeably, GPR is more general. Hence, to avoid specificity where it is not needed, we will use the term GPR.\n\n2.3.1âGPR\n\nThe essentials of GPR are quite similar to conventional regression methods. We wish to construct a model y(x) for the response y to some input x. However, instead of considering, for example, a multi-linear or polynomial model plus a simple noise term, one instead considers a more general expansion of the input in some basis B (which could be constant, linear, polynomial or otherwise) plus a realization of a zero-mean Gaussian process (GP):\n\n(17) y = Î³ B ( x ) + GP ( x ) ,\n\nwhere Î³ is a set of basis coefficients. The Gaussian process is determined by its covariance function, which is the product of the noise parameter Ï and a kernel function. The kernel function gives the covariance function its main structure by determining the correlation between points (x,xâ²) . Usually, these kernel functions are exponentially decaying with the Euclidean distance between the points. In addition to Ï, the covariance function is parameterized by one or more hyperparameters. All in all, GPR consists of fitting Î³, Ï and all the kernel parameters based on a set of training data {yi,xi}, where in general each input xi can be multi-dimensional. These parameters are fit using maximum likelihood estimation, though finding optimal parameters often requires the use of global optimization methods in order to fully consider the range of possible parameter values. The fitted covariance function of the GPR model, in particular the value of Ï, provides a natural estimate of the inherent uncertainty (or expected error) of the surrogate model, which can then be used to establish confidence/prediction intervals for predicted model responses to new inputs. An illustration of GPR is given in Fig.Â 2.\n\n2.3.2âDesign of experiment\n\nAs noted previously, GPR can require a large number of samples to attain its desired fidelity. For this reason, it is common to apply specialized sampling techniques, together usually referred to as the design of experiment (DOE), that sample the input space more efficiently and thereby require less samples than, e.g., uniform random sampling. Depending on the desired outcome, one could, for instance, opt for importance sampling (most useful in this case if it is known that only a certain region of the input space is of interest, e.g., for a reliability analysis where one mainly wishes to use the surrogate model around the failure surface) or a space-filling approach like Latin hypercube sampling or quasi-Monte Carlo sampling (these are most useful when as wide coverage of the input space as possible is needed, e.g., for optimization where the region of interest is likely to shift dynamically). A comparison between Latin hypercube sampling and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling was performed in Kucherenko etÂ al. (2015), where it was found that Latin hypercube sampling can give better or more efficient results for certain types of problems but that quasi-Monte Carlo sampling was otherwise equal or superior and generally more robust when the problem could not be classified a priori. Latin hypercube sampling has been more common for wind energy applications, but a quasi-Monte Carlo sampling method based on the Sobol sequence was used in MÃ¼ller and Cheng (2018).\n\n2.4âProposed RBDO framework\n\nIn the following, we will explain the details of our proposed framework for RBDO of OWT support structures. However, we begin with a few remarks that serve to motivate this approach.\n\n2.4.1âMotivation\n\nConsidering the state of the art for reliability analysis and RBDO for OWTs more generally, we can make a few summary observations based on the previous discussion. Firstly, the vast majority of studies make use of either simplified analytical limit state functions (allowing more easily the use of FORM and making the probabilistic constraints easier to combine with design optimization) or surrogate models that completely replace simulation output (usually combined with sampling-based reliability analysis). Secondly, when not based on heuristic optimization methods (as has been the case for all RBDO studies concerning the design of support structures specifically), gradient-based design optimization as part of RBDO has not utilized analytical sensitivities. Thirdly, little to no use of PMA for reliability analysis or more advanced RBDO methods like SORA or SLA has been made, despite their notable advantages.\n\nWhat can be concluded from this? Simply put, considerable progress could be made by making the state of the art for OWT RBDO, and for support structure design in particular, more in line with the general state of the art. However, this should be done in a way that maintains some of the OWT-specific developments made in previous optimization studies. Furthermore, by combining elements from all these sources, it could be possible to obtain a synthesized methodology that retains many of the individual advantages. However, this requires a new approach because of the ways in which the previous methods seem incompatible. It is, e.g., seemingly not possible to use analytical sensitivities if the simulation output is replaced by surrogate models.\n\n2.4.2âKey simplification\n\nSuppose that all relevant limit state functions gj can be written in the form gj=Q-R , which is generally the case for support structure design, with Q and R being the load effect and resistance as before. Furthermore, for simplicity (and since this is usually the case), assume that while both Q and R are functions of the design x and the stochastic variables Î¸, only Q is determined by simulations. We then make the following simplification:\n\n(18) Q ( x , Î¸ ) = Y ( Î¸ ) Q Ì ( x ) ,\n\nwhere Y is some arbitrary unknown function with the property that Y(Î¸â¾)=1 , with Î¸â¾ as the mean values of Î¸, and QÌ(x)=Q(x,Î¸â¾) is the mean response at the specific design x. A simple example of how such a factorization makes sense locally is shown in Fig.Â 3. What are the implications of this assumption? Firstly, note that this assumption is consistent with the common simplified limit state functions where the stochastic response is modeled as the product of the stochastic variables Î¸ and the design-dependent mean response. However, in our case, we make no assumption about the functional representation of this factorization. Hence, this should allow for a higher-fidelity representation of how stochastic variables input to the system are propagated through the response estimation. Secondly, while this is indeed a simplification which cannot in general be assumed valid, previous studies detailing how the fatigue damage distribution of OWT support structures changes when the design is modified (Stieng and Muskulus,Â 2018, 2019) indicate that this kind of proportional scaling is a reasonable assumption as long as the design does not change too much. Furthermore, it is not unreasonable to make a similar assumption for extreme loads. Thirdly, this factorization makes it possible to fit a surrogate model of the response to variations in the stochastic variables only, while the design-dependent part of the response remains as in a deterministic setting. On the one hand, this means that we can fix the design and fit our surrogate model as\n\n(19) Y ( Î¸ s ) = Q ( x , Î¸ s ) Q Ì ( x ) ,\n\nwhere for each sampled point Î¸s we estimate the total response Q and then factor out the design-dependent mean response. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the surrogate modeling problem, since we do not have to also sample different values of x. Since the fit is design independent given the underlying simplifications, we may then say that we obtain a quasi-global (in design space) surrogate model that can be used throughout a design optimization procedure, greatly reducing the computational effort of any reliability calculation. On the other hand, the separation of stochastic and deterministic response means that for the estimation of design sensitivities we have the property that\n\n(20) â Q ( x , Î¸ ) â x = Y ( Î¸ ) â Q Ì ( x ) â x .\n\nHence, the use of analytical design sensitivities becomes possible. Finally, note that while the simplification is expected to lose accuracy as the design moves further and further away from the initial configuration where the surrogate model was fit, the mean response remains exact. This is not the case when a surrogate model fit replaces the simulated response entirely. Hence, for use in RBDO, the factorization in Eq.Â (18) is going to behave at worst like a deterministic optimization that includes some simplified reliability estimate (based on Y) that modifies both the constraint value and the constraint gradients, in a way not too different from SORA and SLA.\n\n2.4.3âFormal statement\n\nOur overall proposed framework is based on the previously stated PMA-based RBDO problem in Eq.Â (15), restated here for convenience:\n\nminxfmass(x)such thatAlinxâ¤bxâ¤xuxâ¥xlcj(x)â¤0âjâJdetgj(x,v*)â¤0âjâJprob.\n\ngj is now defined as\n\n(21) g j ( x , Î¸ ) = y j ( Î¸ q ) q j ( x ) - r j ( x , Î¸ r ) ,\n\nwith yj as a surrogate model defined and fit according to Eqs.Â (18) and (19), and Î¸q and Î¸r are the stochastic parameters in Î¸ for the load effect and the resistance, respectively. Note that we can obtain Î¸i=HÎ¸i-1(Î¦(vi)) , so that even though the solution of the reliability subproblem resulting in v* is performed in standard normal space, it is never necessary to obtain yj as a function of v. To ensure that the RBDO problem is solved with sufficient accuracy, specifically that the final design is actually feasible with respect to the probabilistic constraints, the procedure can be repeated several times, fitting a new surrogate model at the solution of the previous RBDO loop and starting a new RBDO loop from this design point. The overall method is compactly stated as AlgorithmÂ 1 and illustrated in Fig.Â 4.\n\nThe design optimization performed in this study will in all cases be based on output from time-domain simulations of finite element models. These have been implemented in an in-house, MATLAB finite element code as assembled Timoschenko beam elements with 6Â degrees of freedom at each end of each element. The analysis is based on Newmark integration and uses a consistent mass matrix and a Rayleigh damping matrix with mass and stiffness proportionality scaled according to the first two eigenmodes. A typical finite element, including variables, is shown in Fig.Â 5a and a more general representation of the OWT system is shown in Fig.Â 5b.\n\n3.1âModels and loads\n\nTo test the proposed methodology, two main cases will be used. The first of these cases is a simplified model based on a uniform section of a monopile support structure, initially uniform in its cross-sectional dimensions and with uniform lengths for each element. This is meant to demonstrate the basic idea of the method without having to consider realistic designs. This model will be referred to below as the âSimple Beamâ. The second case is a simplified but reasonably realistic representation of the OC3 Monopile (Jonkman and Musial,Â 2010) with the cross-sectional dimensions of each segment initially corresponding to the OC3 design, i.e., with a uniform monopile segment and a linearly tapered tower segment. The element lengths are consistent within each major segment but differ between the tower and monopile. Furthermore, this model also includes a point mass on the top of the tower, with mass and inertia properties meant to represent the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5âMW turbine (Jonkman etÂ al.,Â 2009). This model will be referred to as the âOC3 Monopileâ. Some of the basic properties of these two models are listed in TableÂ 1, and the material properties are consistent with the ones in Jonkman and Musial (2010). The models are fixed (clamped) at one end (at a location that corresponds to the mudline for the OC3 Monopile); i.e., there is no modeling of soil included. This will affect the global stiffness and change the dynamics of the structural models somewhat but is not expected to have a large effect on how these models function in terms of testing the RBDO method. Both models are loaded at the top with force and moment time series extracted from fixed rotor simulations of the NREL 5âMW turbine subject to turbulent wind fields within the aeroelastic Fedem Windpower software (Fedem Technology,Â 2016). Note that the externally input rotor loads are only calculated once and are taken as design independent, though the response to these loads is calculated for every design. These forces and moments are input into the dynamic simulation as loads on each of the 6Â degrees of freedom on the top node of the tower. Wave loads are represented by a horizontal force time series, applied at a location corresponding to the bottom of the tower in the OC3 Monopile and at an analog location for the Simple Beam. In the dynamic simulation, this is input as a load on the degree of freedom corresponding to displacement in the mean wind direction, but no other degrees of freedom are loaded by this force. This force has been tuned to give an equivalent moment at the lower end of the structures as the integrated contribution of all horizontal wave forces along the height of the water column at each instant in time. These forces are calculated from the Morison equation, based on wave kinematics sampled from the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) spectrum and including Wheeler stretching. The inertia and drag coefficients are 2.0 and 0.8, respectively. Since the wave loads depend on the diameter of the relevant members, these loads are recalculated for every design before being input to the dynamic simulation. The duration of the applied loads is 600âs after the removal of initial transients. Up to four different loading scenarios are included in the analysis, with environmental data based on the Ijmuiden Shallow Water Site (Fischer etÂ al.,Â 2010) and using different random seeds for each realization of wind and wave conditions. The probabilities of occurrence for fatigue estimation have been renormalized so that they sum to 1 for the reduced set of cases. These loading scenarios are summarized in TableÂ 2.\n\n3.2âConstraints\n\nAs indicated in Eq.Â (15), the optimization is constrained with upper and lower bounds on the design variables. This is done from a theoretical point of view in order for the final designs to be somewhat realistic with respect to practical constraints related to manufacturing, transportation and installation that are not specifically accounted for in the modeling. From a more practical point of view, some decreased numerical performance was observed, during initial testing, once the design variables went outside a certain range, especially for certain combinations of values for some variables. For this reason, the upper and lower bounds were set stricter than normal practice would dictate. In particular, the lower bounds are for both models set at 70â% of the smallest initial diameter and thickness, respectively; the upper bounds are set at 150â% of the largest diameter and thickness, respectively. We refer to TableÂ 1 for the smallest and largest values for each model. While these bounds do not directly correspond to any specific real limits, the restriction is not expected to rule out any design of practical interest. As for linear constraints, we will in some cases include an upper limit on the Dât ratio of 120, consistent with the NORSOK standard (Standards Norway,Â 2013). In terms of non-linear constraints, we consider limits on the accumulated 20-year fatigue damage and on the maximum bending moment, to be detailed below. Fatigue calculations are done as follows. From the displacements obtained as the solutions to Eq.Â (3), the internal forces and moments Sin are obtained by multiplication with the element stiffness matrices Ke as\n\n(22) S in = K e u e .\n\nFrom the components of Sin corresponding to the axial force Sax, in-plane and out-of-plane moments Sip and Sop, the normal stress Ïn is then identified as\n\n(23) Ï n = S ax A c + D 2 I c ( S ip - S op ) ,\n\nwhere Ac=Ï((D2)2-(D2-t)2) is the cross-sectional area and Ic=Ï4((D2)4-(D2-t)4) is the second moment of area. Rainflow counting (Rychlik,Â 1987) is then applied to the normal stress time series, resulting in a set of amplitudes ÎÏi that correspond to the differences between stresses at particular times (a stress cycle), encoded in the vectors tpeak and tvalley, i.e.,\n\n(24) Î Ï i = Ï n ( t peak ( i ) ) - Ï n ( t valley ( i ) ) .\n\nUnlike what is otherwise common practice, these amplitudes are not binned. This is in order to facilitate the sensitivity analysis. The incurred fatigue damage F is then estimated by use of the PalmgrenâMiner linear summation rule, where the contribution from each stress cycle is given by application of the appropriate SN curves and thickness correction (Det Norske Veritas,Â 2016):\n\n(25) F = â i n i a i Î Ï i - w i t t ref - k w i ,\n\nwhere ni is either 0.5 or 1.0 depending on whether the given cycle is a half or full cycle, ai is a constant, wi is the WÃ¶hler exponent, tref is the reference thickness below which no correction is necessary, and k is the thickness correction exponent. The constants ai, wi, tref and k are set using the SN curves for welds in tubular joints (in air and in water with corrosion protection, respectively, depending on the element) found in Det Norske Veritas (2016). The total lifetime fatigue damage, Ftot, from all considered environmental states, E, is then\n\n(26) F tot = T lf â E F ( E ) P occ ( E ) ,\n\nwhere Tlf is a factor scaling up from simulation time to a 20-year lifetime, F(E) evaluates Eq.Â (25) for each state, E and Pocc are the corresponding probabilities of occurrence for these states. The limit state function for fatigue, measuring the extent to which the lifetime fatigue damage exceeds the fatigue resistance ÎF (usually set to 1), used as a constraint in the deterministic optimization problem, is hence\n\n(27) F tot - Î F â¤ 0 .\n\nFor the maximum bending moment, the calculation is based on Sip as obtained from Eq.Â (22). However, since the use of global maxima can cause problems with smoothness (the global maximum may not always change smoothly) and since checking the bending moment at every time step would be very time consuming, a compromise is made. In particular, the KreisselmeierâSteinhauser function (Kreisselmeier and Steinhauser,Â 1979) is used to smoothly aggregate the bending moment time series into an upper envelope of the maximum:\n\n(28) M KS = S ip,max + 1 r log â i exp ( S ip ( t i ) - S ip,max ) r ,\n\nwhere the subscript max denotes the global maximum, and r is a constant controlling the accuracy of the approximation. The above expression approaches Sip,max from above as r approaches infinity. For computations, r is typically taken to be 50â200 (set to 200 here) depending on desired accuracy (see Couceiro etÂ al.,Â 2019 for a discussion of this for OWT applications). Note that, algebraically speaking, Sip,max cancels out . Taking Eq.Â (28) as an estimate of the maximum bending moment, we then compare this with the NORSOK design criterion for tubular members subject to bending (Standards Norway,Â 2013). The calculation for the bending resistance uses the one for a Dât ratio of 120 (for realistic Dât ratios exceeding this value, the changes are negligible). The resulting limit state is\n\n(29) M KS - Z Î³ M 0.94 f y - 0.76 120 E f y 2 â¤ 0 ,\n\nwhere Z=16(D3-(D-2t)3) is the plastic section modulus, Î³M is the material factor and fy is the yield strength of the material. The material factor is fixed at 1.45.\n\nIn principle, many other types of constraints should be included in order to ensure that the structure adheres to safety standards (e.g., buckling) and having constraints on eigenfrequency (to avoid dynamic amplification) is also common. However, in order to focus our attention on how the basic support structure optimization problem is affected by the presence of probabilistic constraints, and see the effect of each probabilistic constraint more clearly, these other safety checks have been left out.\n\n3.3âSensitivity\n\nThe estimation of gradients for the objective function as given in Eq.Â (2) and the linear constraints is trivial. For the non-linear constraints, it is mainly a question of repeated application of the chain rule as well as the rule of total derivatives for multivariate functions. See, e.g., Chew etÂ al. (2016) for details of how this can be done (the only modification in our case being the additional level added by Eq.Â 28, which is easily differentiated). However, note that, due to how the displacement sensitivity is calculated in Eq.Â (4), regardless of location in the structure, there is always a dependence on each design variable for every non-linear constraint. Hence, none of these derivatives are zero in general.\n\n3.4âProbabilistic aspects and uncertainty modeling\n\nFor the RBDO formulation based on PMA, the limit state functions represented by Eqs.Â (27) and (29) can be directly used, with the understanding that Ftot, Îf, MKS and fy become probabilistic quantities. Using the notation in Eq.Â (21), we have\n\n(30)gfls=yfls(Î¸q)FÌtot(x)-ÎF(31)guls=yuls(Î¸q)MÌKS(x)-Z(x)Î³M0.94fy-0.76120Efy2,\n\nwhere, for simplicity, we define ÎF:=Î¸ÎF and fy:=Î¸fy . The sensitivities then follow from Eqs.Â (14), (20) and the above discussion. In this study, a target reliability index of Î²max=3.3, corresponding to Pf=4.8Ã10-4(â5Ã10-4) , will be used for the solution of the PMA subproblem in Eq.Â (13) as part of AlgorithmÂ 1. The uncertainties that are included in the response are global stiffness, global damping and turbulence intensity. The uncertainty modeling will be detailed below.\n\n3.4.1âGlobal stiffness\n\nThe uncertainty in stiffness is assumed to come from uncertainty in soil stiffness. Though no soil modeling is included in the present analysis, this mainly introduces a shift of the mean stiffness, and hence one may still consider the impact of a stochastic uncertainty in the soil stiffness. The effect of soil pile stiffness on the fundamental eigenfrequency of a monopile was discussed in Kallehave etÂ al. (2015). The expected range of the fundamental frequency was found to be [0.937,1.045] as a ratio of its mean value. If we symmetrize this as [0.94,1.06] and use the fact that global stiffness of a monopile is proportional to the square of the fundamental eigenfrequency, we can then obtain the expected range of global stiffness as [0.88,1.12] as a ratio of its mean value. Taking this to be a 98â% confidence interval and, for lack of other information, assuming that the uncertainty in global stiffness follows a normal distribution, we obtain that Î¸stiffâ¼N(1,0.052) , i.e., a coefficient of variation (CoV) of 0.052. As an independent confirmation, this is close to, if a bit higher, than what would be obtained from Andersen etÂ al. (2012) and Damgaard etÂ al. (2015) (each giving a coefficient of variation of about 0.04).\n\n3.4.2âGlobal damping\n\nFor the uncertainty in global damping, the two main contributions are assumed to come from aerodynamic damping and soil damping. Expected ranges of the damping coefficients corresponding to these two sources can be obtained from Chen and Duffour (2018) as [4.0,8.0] for aerodynamic damping (in the foreâaft direction for operational conditions) and [0.17,1.30] for soil damping, both given as percentages of critical damping. Assuming, as above, that these ranges correspond to 98â% confidence intervals and that the uncertainty can be modeled (for lack of better knowledge) as following a normal distribution, then we obtain Î¸damp,aeroâ¼N(6,0.86) and Î¸damp,soilâ¼N(0.735,0.243) . Summing these contributions and adding also a constant (deterministic) structural damping of 1.0, the final result is Î¸dampâ¼N(7.735,0.89) , a CoV of 0.115. The soil uncertainty obtained here is about the same as would be derived from Damgaard etÂ al. (2015). The aerodynamic damping is harder to verify with additional sources, and in principle the level of uncertainty is expected to be wind speed dependent. For lack of more detailed knowledge, the present values are used in this study.\n\nAs a small comment, we have so far assumed both stiffness and damping to follow normal distributions. It has been common practice in previous studies to model uncertainties related to soil and aerodynamic damping as log-normally distributed (sometimes other skewed distributions). However, at a CoV of 0.05, there is almost no difference between the corresponding normal and log-normal distributions. Even with a CoV of 0.12, the differences are fairly small. See Fig.Â 6 for details. Hence, the impact of this simplification is minor.\n\n3.4.3âTurbulence intensity\n\nThe turbulence intensity is modeled as log-normally distributed with a wind speed-dependent mean and a CoV of 0.05, i.e., Î¸turbâ¼LN(m,0.05) , with m derived from TableÂ 2. This is consistent with, e.g., SÃ¸rensen and Tarp-Johansen (2005), Veldkamp (2008) and Toft and SÃ¸rensen (2011). The particular value is based on the expected uncertainty in turbulence intensity as derived from the uncertainty of cup anemometer measurements. If including also the uncertainty from wake modeling in a wind farm, which is not done here, the CoV will be higher (Toft etÂ al.,Â 2016b).\n\n3.4.4âFatigue resistance and yield strength\n\nThe fatigue resistance is modeled as log-normally distributed with a mean of 1.0 and a CoV of 0.3, consistent with, e.g., MÃ¡rquez-DomÃ­nguez and SÃ¸rensen (2012) and Toft etÂ al. (2016b), i.e., ÎFâ¼LN(-0.431,0.294) .\n\nThe yield strength is modeled as log-normally distributed with a mean of 288âMPa and a CoV of 0.1, consistent with, e.g., Melchers (1999). To account for some of the effects of the simplifications used to arrive at Eq.Â (29), the CoV is increased to 0.15. Hence, fyâ¼LN(5.652,0.149) .\n\nThe uncertainty modeling is summarized in TableÂ 3.\n\n3.5âImplementation details\n\nSo far, some of the details of the proposed methodology have been left unspecified in order to suggest an overall framework for RBDO rather than a very specific set of methods. The literature contains a large amount of choice in regards to optimization algorithms (both at the design optimization level and in the inner optimization loop solving the reliability problem), surrogate modeling and DOE. While these details have to be fixed in order to demonstrate the method in practice, the optimal selection of algorithms is not considered within the scope of the present study. Such optimality will in any case be both application specific and depend on the personal preferences of the designer.\n\nWith regards to both levels of the optimization, we use a combination of SQP and interior-point methods (Nocedal and Wright,Â 2006), both of which are common examples of gradient-based non-linear constrained optimization algorithms. In principle, the PMA-based reliability problem can be solved more efficiently by use of the hybrid mean-value method (Youn etÂ al.,Â 2003) or related approaches, but due to the use of the surrogate model, this is not deemed necessary for the current application. Convergence of the optimization is based on fairly standard criteria, with termination of the algorithms when either relative first-order optimality (see, e.g., Nocedal and Wright,Â 2006) is achieved with a tolerance of 10â6 or the relative changes in the design variables are less than 10â6. Solutions are required to be feasible with a tolerance of 10â6.\n\nFor the surrogate modeling, we have chosen GPR due to the benefits stated previously. After some initial trial and error, the MatÃ©rn class kernel with Î½=3/2 was chosen, including the use of individual length scale hyperparameters for each input variable (this implements what is known as automatic relevance determination, in principle de-emphasizing less relevant input variables in the regression problem; see, e.g., Rasmussen and Williams,Â 2006). Overall, this was found to be the most robust for the regression problem in this study, especially when considering repeated regression for additional iterations of the outer loop in AlgorithmÂ 1. The MatÃ©rn class of kernels was also used for OWT support structures in HÃ¤fele etÂ al. (2019). We also note here that in order to simplify the simultaneous regression with respect to all of the three parameters in Î¸q, these parameters were input to the fitting problem in such a way that the surrogate model became co-monotonic in every variable (an increase in one or more variables giving always an increase in the output). In this case, that meant inputting the inverse (1âÎ¸i) of the parameters controlling damping and stiffness. Furthermore, these parameters were implemented as scaling variables with means of 1.0, such that the actual variables as input to the simulations were a product of the deterministic values and the respective stochastic scaling parameters in Î¸q. The hyperparameters of the Gaussian process model were fit using Bayesian global optimization methods (expected improvement) (Mockus,Â 1975; Jones etÂ al.,Â 1998; Brochu etÂ al.,Â 2010). The noise standard deviation was taken to be non-zero and also fit during this procedure, even though the simulation outputs used in the fitting are in a certain sense noise-free. This was done because it was seen to give more robust surrogates with respect to changes in the design.\n\nThe DOE was done using Sobol sequences, a quasi-Monte Carlo method. This has the advantage of being more space-filling, covering a larger range of the space while still having some clustering to account for local variations, compared to many ordinary Monte Carlo methods. While not made use of here, Sobol sequences also have the advantage compared to the commonly used Latin hypercube sampling method that it is much easier to interactively add new samples to the old set. To this last point, the use of an adaptive DOE was not used here, despite this increasingly becoming the common approach for GPR. The main reason why was a practical one, having to do with the way the loading input was sampled, which made interactively adding samples during a fitting procedure difficult for our implementation. A total number of 500 samples were pre-generated, with the number of samples actually used increasing for each iteration of the outer loop in the following way. For the initial surrogate model, 50 samples were used. The new model at the solution of the first RBDO procedure was then trained with 100 samples and compared with the old model using 25 additional samples, for a total of 125 samples used. All subsequent iterations use the full set of 500 samples, with 400 used for training and 100 for comparing the current model with the previous one. In a sense, the DOE is thus somewhat dynamic, even if it is not adaptive.\n\nFinally, the outer loop needs termination criteria, as indicated in AlgorithmÂ 1. One such criterion was chosen to be simply the convergence of the objective function value. Once this value changes less than a certain small tolerance, the outer loop was halted. However, it is possible to terminate slightly earlier if the surrogate model is seen to converge, since in that case the objective function will not change significantly or at all during the next iteration. As implied above, the new surrogate models trained at the solution of the current RBDO loop were thus compared with the models used during that loop. Due to the use of noisy regression models, the surrogate models will in practice never converge entirely (or will at least do so very slowly) as long as there are small changes in the design (and small changes in the surrogate model give further small changes in the design, etc.). Hence, a more relaxed convergence criterion was developed for the surrogate models. Specifically, if we denote by yâ¾new and yâ¾old , the mean prediction of the new and old surrogate models, respectively, and by Ïy,old, the predicted standard deviation of the old model, then if\n\n(32) | y â¾ new - y â¾ old | â¤ Ï y ,old ,\n\nfor every test sample point, the surrogate model is not updated. If no surrogate models are updated after an outer iteration, the procedure terminates. In order for this relaxed tolerance not to give infeasible results with respect to the new surrogate model (which is not used when it is within the above tolerance), the surrogate predictions for y(Î¸q), used to compute the numerical values for the limit state functions in Eqs.Â (30) and (31), are based on the mean plus the standard deviation, yâ¾+Ïy , rather than just the mean. This guarantees that when yâ¾old is used instead of the updated model, the derived results remain strictly feasible with respect to mean of the more accurate prediction (which would otherwise have been used). Since the standard deviations tend to be â¼[10-3,10-2] , this does not have a large impact on the results.\n\nAbdallah, I., Lataniotis, C., and Sudret, B.: Parametric hierarchical kriging for multi-fidelity aero-servo-elastic simulators â Application to extreme loads on wind turbines, Probabilist.
