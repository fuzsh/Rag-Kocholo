        "text": "A preliminary case has been developed for using alternative integrity validation (AIV) for deepwater gas pipelines in place of the precommissioning hydrotest. The features of an AIV program that would compensate for lack of a hydrotest have been identified. Measures to prevent or detect linepipe damage or deterioration during transportation and installation are discussed. Quantitative reliability analysis methods have been explored to compare the effectiveness of AIV and the traditional hydrotest in exposing the types of flaws typically found in girth welds. Recommendations are made for the collection of data on flaw frequencies and size distributions, as lack of these data is currently an impediment to the full application of probabilistic models\n\nAn engineering procedure for assessing the integrity of flawed girth welds of offshore pipelines, designated as Engineering Criticality Assessment (ECA), allows to define either allowable defect size for anticipated extreme load conditions or allowable stress and strains for pre-defined Defect Acceptance Criteria (DAC). The use of ECA in offshore pipeline projects, always in combination with Automatic Ultrasonic Testing (AUT), is currently common practice. New ECA guidelines or revisions of existing ones have been launched in the last decade. BS 7910 and DNV-OS-F101 are considered as reference in many offshore districts of the Oil & Gas Industry. What is specific in offshore pipelines with respect to pressure vessel or nuclear plants, for which ECA was first established, it is that global bending is a primary load condition and, in many circumstances, the elastic limit is exceeded. This implies an extension of stress based ECA, the original one, into strain based ECA. In addition, for offshore pipelines it may be relevant the bi-axiality of the state of stress, caused by the presence of internal pressure. Early keywords for ECA were failure assessment diagram (FAD), material toughness and plastic capacity as well as fracture and plastic collapse failure modes etc... Current keywords are crack driving force (CDF), constraint and representative material J or CTOD resistance or R-curve, ductile tearing failure mode, strain based ECA etc. In this paper it is presented the approach adopted to define defect acceptance criteria for specific new projects of offshore pipelines and to assess the pipeline strength in presence of measured flaws in the girth welds of old ones. The proposed approach follows the framework of BS7910 currently in force, for load conditions of installation and operation. The approach is commented in relation to DNV OS-F101 2012 and R&D outcome as well. Particularly it is described how to account for internal pressure in presence of high longitudinal strains (in the order of 0.5-1.0%) as an example due to bottom roughness or in service buckling. The contradictions of strain based ECA using stress-based fracture mechanics models and relevant parameter testing are discussed, and how to qualify the strength capacity of girth weld in strain-based design (greater than 1.0%) is provided."
