        "text": "The relationship between Princess Haya of Jordan and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, ended in a traumatic divorce that played out in the British courts. It brought to an end a high-profile marriage that began 19 years ago this week.\n\nOn 10 April 2004, at the Al Baraka palace in Amman, the couple wed in an intimate ceremony attended only by close family members. Princess Haya of Jordan, who became the sixth wife of the Sheikh, was radiant in an intricately embroidered white gown; he dark hair draped with a sheer white veil. Guests at the ceremony included Princess Haya of Jordan’s brother, King Abdullah II of Jordan, along with his wife, Queen Rania of Jordan. Princess Muna, King Abdullah’s mother and her father’s previous wife, was also in attendance. Pictures from the day show the couple smiling as they pose for the cameras – but the happiness wasn’t to last.\n\nRead More\n\nThe captivating tale of Jordan’s British princess: how a Suffolk-born officer’s daughter fell in love with a king\n\nShe was a teenager when she met King Hussein while working on Lawrence of Arabia. Now her son, King Abdullah II, is on the throne. As she celebrates her 83rd birthday, revisit the remarkable tale of Princess Muna al-Hussein\n\nIn May 2019, the marriage fell apart when Princess Haya fled Dubai ‘in fear of her life’ following reports that her husband became ‘concerned at her apparent closeness to her British bodyguard’. Thus followed one of the most widely-covered divorce cases of all time, ending with Sheikh Mohammed paying a record £554 million settlement and losing legal responsibility for the former couple’s two children. The court case, which a High Court judge described as a ‘campaign of fear, intimidation and harassment’ that amounted to ‘abuse’, is over and the princess is now said to be living in rural Wales.\n\nRead More\n\nPrincess Haya finds solace after divorce battle at rural Welsh retreat\n\nThe former wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has reportedly purchased a country hotel, which she plans to convert into a new home\n\nBorn in 1974, Princess Haya is the daughter of the late King Hussein and Queen Alia. When she was three years old, her mother died in a helicopter crash. She was educated in the UK, attending Badminton school and later Bryanston school. She went on to study Politics Philosophy and Economics (PPE) at St Hilda’s College, Oxford, graduating in 1995. A keen equestrian, the princess represented Jordan in Show Jumping at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. In 1999, her father died of health complications, leaving the crown to her half-brother, King Abdullah II.\n\nPrincess Haya’s ex-husband, Sheikh Mohammed, 73, is the current ruler of Dubai with a personal wealth estimated at $4.5 billion. He is the owner of Godolphin horse racing stables, a thoroughbred breeding operation, and was said to be a friend of the late Queen Elizabeth II, attending her funeral in September 2022. He reportedly owns real estate in the United Kingdom worth more than £100 million.\n\nRead More\n\nMove over Paris, 2024 is the year of the Wedding Olympics – and it’s only just getting started\n\nWith the Ambanis for India, Prince Abdul Mateen for Brunei and the Duke of Westminster for Great Britain – who will claim gold? It’s a heated contest for the medal that really counts\n\nDespite Princess Haya’s recent divorce, the Jordanian Royal Family has celebrated a joyful few years, as they came together for not one, but two weddings. Princess Iman of Jordan and Princess 'Azemah Ni'matul Bolkiah of Brunei married on 12 March 2023, with Princess Iman resplendent in a white Dior gown and twinkling tiara. As well as this, Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II of Jordan married Rajwa Al Saif on 1 June 2023 – only days before the 30th wedding anniversary of his parents, King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan."
