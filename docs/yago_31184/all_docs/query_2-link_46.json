        "text": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — In a series of predawn appointments on Wednesday, King Salman of Saudi Arabia eased the potentially treacherous issue of royal succession by placing a new generation of security-focused leaders first in the line of succession. The far-reaching changes carry the potential to reshape not only the kingdom and its place in the region, but also its relations with its most important ally, the United States.\n\n“The government is now in the hands of the next generation, under the supervision of the king,” said Khalid al-Dakhil, a Saudi political analyst.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia locked in bloody proxy wars with its longstanding regional rival, Iran, for influence in Yemen and Syria, the 79-year-old king promoted the two princes most responsible for the kingdom’s security.\n\nPrince Mohammed bin Nayef, 55, the interior minister who has headed the kingdom’s counterterrorism efforts, was installed as crown prince, with King Salman pushing aside his youngest half brother, Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, 69.\n\nThe defense minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who may be in his mid-30s or even younger and is one of the king’s youngest sons, was named deputy crown prince. It was a startling move in a royal dynasty that puts great stock in age; when lining up to greet the king, Al Saud princes long stood in a row according to age.\n\nAnd Prince Saud al-Faisal, who served as foreign minister for four decades, was replaced by the much younger Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
