        "text": "Originally posted by QueenB@Jun 27th, 2004 - 3:50 pm\n\nIs she royal by birth as well? Even after divorce - and with a new love - she's still HRH Princess Firyal?\n\nI think she is royal through marriage only. Maybe she's never married Mr. Pincus because she would have to turn in the title if she did.\n\nNot to come across as mean or anything, but it seems like she's really capitalizing socially on that title and has little to no interest in doing any of the royal grunt work.\n\nShe was born a Sharifa and became HRH Princess by marriage. She remains HRH Princess because it is the Jordanian custom that women who become royal by marriage remain royal after divorce and even after remarriage. If she were to remarry she would remain HRH Princess. Though, I highly doubt she would marry a Jewish man as Muslim women are not premitted to marry outside their faith. She has been linked to numerous (wealthy) men.\n\nShe is capitalizing on her title, but she is also very involved in charitable activities. So, she is paying the \"rent\" on her title as I call royal charity work.\n\nOriginally posted by Lalla Meriem@Jun 27th, 2004 - 5:52 pm\n\nShe is capitalizing on her title, but she is also very involved in charitable activities. So, she is paying the \"rent\" on her title as I call royal charity work.\n\nBut it seems only the charities that bring her into contact with other socialites. I suppose I draw the distinction between a socialite's do-gooding and the real heavy lifting of humanitarian work that involves, e.g., traveling to dangerous and less desirable places, longer term commitments to a given cause, much disappointment because the problems are so challenging, etc.\n\ni have always thought it interesting that a descendent of mohamed has been dating a jewish man,perhaps it shows that their is a chance for peace in the middle-east,when you accept people on an individual basis and don't judje people by ethnic/political groups,it's a start anyway.\n\np.s. also note in the pictures sally and rufus albemarle a.k.a the earl and countess of albemarle,she being an iranian artist and he being a scottish noble-man.\n\np.p.s. make love not war,it's healthier for everyone concerned."
