        "text": "Jordanian prince and academic\n\nPrince Ghazi bin Muhammad[2] (born 15 October 1966) is a Jordanian prince and a professor of philosophy.[3][4][5] He is the son of Prince Muhammad bin Talal of Jordan and his first wife, Princess Firyal.

An abandoned site in Jordan overlooking the river, was heavily mined in 1967 due to an acquired front line position during the Six-Day War. In 1994 after the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Prince Ghazi who is deeply interested in religious history, was searching the area after a monk convinced him to take a look around of what was thought to be the baptism site. When they found evidence of ruins, that was enough to encourage de-mining and further development. Soon afterwards, there were several archaeological digs, tourists influx and pilgrimage activity, and several papal and state visits. In July 2015, the site was designated as a UNESCO world heritage site and is now known as the most likely location for the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist.[26]\n\nWelcoming Pope Benedict XVI to Amman\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince Ghazi gave the welcoming address on the occasion of the pilgrimage of Pope Benedict XVI in Jordan, May 9, 2009. His wide-ranging speech, during Benedict's visit to the new King Hussein Mosque in Amman, was carried live on Eternal Word Television Network TV. It gave an account of Muslim-Christian relationships, acknowledged the pope's kindness toward Muslims and made an appeal on behalf of Muslim minorities (as on Mindanao). The speech also noted that crusaders had damaged the Christian tribes in Jordan that had preceded Islam by 600 years.[27]\n\nWorld Interfaith Harmony Week\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 23, 2010, King Abdullah II of Jordan proposed a World Interfaith Harmony Week to the UN General Assembly.\n\nOn October 20, 2010, Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, Personal Envoy and Special Advisor of the King of Jordan, presented the proposal – having conceived and written the draft resolution[28] – before the UN General Assembly 34th plenary meeting in New York where it was adopted unanimously. His speech called to those who love God and love the neighbour, or the Good and the neighbour, to coordinate and concentrate their activities in a more effective way.\n\nThe misuse or abuse of religions can thus be a cause of world strife, whereas religions should be a great foundation for facilitating world peace. The remedy for this problem can only come from the world’s religions themselves. Religions must be part of the solution, not part of the problem.[29]\n\nInternational Initiative for Islamic Integral Professorial Chairs (IIIPC)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 30, 2012, in celebration of King Abdullah II's fiftieth birthday, Prince Ghazi launched the International Initiative for Islamic Integral Professorial Chairs (IIIPC). This started with the Integral Chair for the Study of Imam Al-Ghazali's Work, which was established in Jerusalem at the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque and Al-Quds University, and King Abdullah II ibn Al-Hussein Waqf for the Integral Chair for the Study of Imam Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi's Work, which was established at the King Hussein bin Talal Mosque, the University of Jordan and W.I.S.E. University. Other Islamic integral professorial chairs are to come.[30][31]\n\nVisiting the Al-Aqsa Mosque\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 28 February 2012, during a meeting for the Arab League in Doha, Qatar, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas made a plea for Muslims to visit the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. On April 18, 2012, Prince Ghazi, accompanied by the Grand Mufti of Egypt Sheikh Ali Goma, broke what had been a 45-year taboo in some parts of the Islamic World (propagated notably by Al-Jazeera-based Sheikh Al-Qaradawi) and visited the Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to pray there and support the beleaguered Muslim community in Jerusalem. The visit was viewed as controversial in Egypt, but set off a change of public opinion in the Islamic World that continues to this day.[32][33]\n\nDuring the trip to Jerusalem, the Prince and the Grand Mufti also visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. This visit was much appreciated by the Christian community of Jerusalem.[34]\n\nInternational delegation of Muslims and Christians' visit to Nigeria\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 22 and 26 May 2012 an international delegation of Muslims and Christians, sponsored jointly by the Royal Jordanian Aal Al Bayt Institute (RABIIT) and the World Council of Churches (WCC), visited Nigeria. Prince Ghazi headed the Muslim delegation and Revd Dr. Olav Fykse Tveit led the Christian delegation.\n\nThe visit was proposed in reaction to the numerous incidents of fierce inter-communal strife which have affected the lives of Nigerians during 2000–2012, and the awareness that Nigeria is the country in the world where the most severe inter-communal violence between Christians and Muslims has been experienced.[35]\n\nThe delegation sought to understand the reasons behind this violence. To this end they issued a report entitled 'Report on the Inter-Religious Tensions and Crisis In Nigeria’[36][37]\n\nPositions at non-governmental organizations\n\n[edit]\n\nMember of the Muslim Council of Elders[38]\n\n2014 to present.\n\nFreeIslamicCalligraphy.com [39]\n\nFounder, 2013.\n\nThe Prince Ghazi Trust for Islamic Thought\n\nFounder and Director, 2012 to present.\n\nIslamica Magazine\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors,[40]\n\nJune 2008 to 2010.\n\nCoordinator of the International A Common Word Initiative[41]\n\nJanuary 2008 to present.\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nA Thinking Person’s Guide to Love (in English) (Turath Publishing), 2023.
