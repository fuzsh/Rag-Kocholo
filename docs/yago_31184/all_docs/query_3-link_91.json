        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Alwaleed was born into Saudi royalty.\n\nHe is the son of Prince Talal and Mona Al Solh.\n\nHis maternal grandfather was the first prime minister of Lebanon and his paternal grandfather, King Abdulaziz, created Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe attended a California school for college.\n\nIt was while attending Menlo College in Atherton, California that he acquired what many believe to be a Western world outlook, making him the go-to Saudi investor for American businessmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe got his big break when he invested in a little company called Citicorp.\n\nHe received a $30,000 gift, a $300,000 loan, and a house from his father after graduating, and slowly began investing.\n\nIn 1991, when Alwaleed was 36, he made a high-stakes decision to invest in Citicorp, which made him $800 million. By 2005, that had turned into $10 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's married to the gorgeous Princess Ameerah.\n\nPrincess Ameerah is Alwaleed's fourth bride (and his only current wife — Alwaleed is a one-wife-at-a-time kind of guy).\n\nThey've been married for eight years, and she is heavily involved in charity work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has met many of the richest and most impressive people on the planet.\n\nAlwaleed makes a point of meeting and being seen with the world's royals, politicians, and celebrities.\n\nHe and his wife were guests at Kate Middleton and Prince William's royal wedding, and he's met the Queen of England, Prince Charles, Nicholas Sarkozy, Queen Rania of Jordan, Michael Jackson, and the former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe owns an estimated $700 million in jewelry.\n\nWhen Forbes' Kerry Dolan visited with the Saudi Prince in 2009, he reportedly showed her part of his impressive jewelry collection that he claimed neither he nor his wife even used:\n\n\"The most spectacular set on display was a diamond and emerald necklace with three emeralds the size of sparrow eggs dangling from the center, with earrings and a ring to match. With a combined total of 200 carats, the set is worth $40 million,\" Dolan wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe sleeps only four hours a night and loves CNBC.\n\nThe prince follows a bizarre schedule of going to bed at 4 or 5 am, and waking up at 9 am. He then eats one big meal a day at 8 pm which he calls \"lunch.\"\n\nThe TV is constantly turned to CNBC while Alwaleed is eating or working, and the Saudi royal has even appeared as a guest on his favorite TV channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's a women's rights advocate (sort of).\n\nThe prince takes pride in the fact that nearly 65 percent of the staff at his palace and his investment company, Kingdom Holding, are women.\n\nBut he's been accused of doing it for publicity: For instance, Business Insider's Nicholas Carlson reports his female pilot Hanadi Zakariya Hindi has hardly flown any of Alwaleed's aircraft, and when she was hired, Alwaleed told his aviation staff that she never would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe bought the third biggest yacht in the world for $500 million.\n\nAlwaleed's old yacht, the New Kingdom 5KR Yacht, was 282 feet long, and appeared in the Bond movie \"Never Say Never Again.\" The boat has a disco, cinema, helipad, pool, guest rooms, and more.\n\nBut Alwaleed commissioned a new yacht double the size at 557 feet, making it the third biggest yacht in the world. It's expected to be delivered in 2014 and will cost a reported $500 million.\n\nHe owns a lot of expensive cars, too.\n\nHis collection includes a Rolls Royce Phantom, which retails just under $500,000, a $48 million diamond-encrusted Mercedes Benz SL 600, and several other Lamborghinis and Ferraris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe bought (and then sold) an Airbus 380 plane.\n\nIt was reportedly tricked out with three floors, a Turkish bath, a \"concert hall\" with seating for 10, a boardroom with holographic projectors, and a garage for his Rolls Royce. The aircraft cost an estimated $500 million.\n\nAlwaleed recently sold the plane to a private buyer for an undisclosed price, with proceeds going toward his investments in Saudi Arabia and the greater Middle East, according to his spokesperson.\n\nBut he still owns his Boeing 747.\n\nAlwaleed owns a $220 million Boeing 747 with a throne, two bedrooms, and a 14-seat dining table with 11 flight attendants from around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe lives in a 420-room palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlwaleed's palace is made with high-quality marble and hung with large portraits and photographs of himself.\n\nIt also has two indoor pools and an outdoor tennis court.\n\nHe also owns a huge farm/resort on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe Farm has over 120 acres, and has a miniature version of the Grand Canyon, a mini-zoo, horse stables, and five artificial lakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlwaleed is a big game hunter.\n\nHe often goes on hunting expeditions, and shoots game that are typically illegal to hunt. His prized animal is a stuffed zebra that he killed with his daughter.\n\nHis palace is filled with the taxidermied animals that are put on display for guests to admire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe hires little people to act like his \"court jesters.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Nicholas Carlson reports: \"Almost every source we spoke to, including Alwaleed's official spokesperson, confirmed that, like a medieval monarch, Alwaleed keeps in his entourage a group of dancing, laughing, joking dwarfs.\"\n\nThe sources continued that even though they were initially shocked, in Saudi culture it would be considered charity since the little people would most likely be out of work and considered \"freaks\" in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it's not all about the toys: Alwaleed also donates heavily to charities.\n\nIt is common for Alwaleed to make donations to petitioners, as well as to numerous charities and causes through the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation (even if it might just be for publicity).\n\nHe has given to those affected by the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, as well as to universities like Harvard and Cambridge.\n\nHe's not the only prince doing well for himself.\n\nThe Incredible Lives Of The World's Richest Royals >\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
