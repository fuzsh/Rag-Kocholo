        "meta_description": "Financier Lionel Pincus's two sons are suing their father's companion, Princess Firyal of Jordan. The lawsuit claims that the Princess, the first wife of Jordan's Prince Muhammad bin Talal, who is the brother of the late King Hussein I of Jordan, took advantage of Pincus's deteriorating mental and physical state by spending extravagant sums to decorate a $50 million, 14-room duplex in New York's Pierre Hotel, on Fifth Avenue. (Um, $21,000 candlesticks, anyone?) In wording that has sparked comparisons to the ongoing Brooke Astor case, allegations are being made that changes the Princess had Pincus make to his will—ones that make her the recipient of his art collection, a lavish apartment, and $35 million in cash—were unlawful because Pincus, who was mentally incapacitated after cancer surgery in 2006, was too sickly to understand the paperwork. The spendthrift royal even had her boyfriend sign papers saying that if Pincus were ever declared mentally unfit, she would receive $10 million. (He was; she did.) The Pincus sons, who hope to sell their father's town house and donate the money to charity, claim the Princess is deliberately attempting to block the property's sale so that she might inherit it. The suit also points an accusing finger at the royal divorcée's predilection for dating wealthy men—reports indicate that she began seeing Pincus, a widower, shortly after the death of her long-term companion, the Greek shipping mogul Stavros Niarchos. According to the venerable New York Social Diary, Pincus and his girlfriend are a well-liked couple on the social scene; the site diplomatically notes that the Princess's \"presence in Mr. Pincus' life has added a touch of glamour that he neither previously possessed nor seemed interested in.\"",
