        "text": "His Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein assumed his constitutional powers as King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on February 7th, 1999, the day his father, the late King Hussein, passed away.\n\nHis Majesty King Hussein bin Talal, the father of modern Jordan, will always be remembered as a leader who guided his country through strife and turmoil to become an oasis of peace, stability, and moderation in the Middle East. Among Jordanians, his memory is cherished as the inspiration for Jordan's climate of openness, tolerance, and compassion. Known to his people as Al-Malik Al-Insan (\"The Humane King\"), King Hussein was the forty-second generation direct descendant of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him (PBUH).\n\nBorn in Amman on November 14th, 1935, to Prince Talal bin Abdullah and Princess Zein Al-Sharaf bint Jamil, King Hussein attended Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and Harrow School in England. He later received his military education at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England.\n\nKing Hussein was proclaimed King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on August 11th, 1952. A Regency Council was appointed until King Hussein’s formal accession to the throne on May 2nd, 1953, when he assumed his constitutional powers after reaching the age of eighteen, according to the Islamic calendar.\n\nThroughout his long and eventful reign, King Hussein worked hard at building his country and raising the living standard of every Jordanian. Early on, King Hussein concentrated on building an economic and industrial infrastructure that would complement and enhance the advances he wanted to achieve in the quality of life of his people. During the 1960s, Jordan’s main industries - including phosphate, potash, and cement - were developed, and a network of highways was built throughout the kingdom.\n\nBorn in Amman on January 30th, 1962, His Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein is the eldest son of His Majesty, the late King Hussein, and Her Royal Highness Princess Muna Al-Hussein. He began his primary education at the Islamic Educational College in Amman, and later attended St. Edmund's School in Surrey, England. For his secondary education, he attended Eaglebrook School and Deerfield Academy in the United States of America.\n\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein joined the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom in 1980, and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in 1981. He was later appointed Reconnaissance Troop Leader in the 13th/18th Battalion of the Royal Hussars (British Army) in (West) Germany and England. In 1982, His Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein attended Oxford University where he completed a one-year Special Studies course in Middle Eastern Affairs. Upon returning home, His Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein joined the Jordanian Armed Forces.\n\nSince his ascension to the throne, His Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein is committed to building on the late King's legacy to further institutionalize democratic and political pluralism in Jordan. He has made extensive efforts towards ensuring sustainable levels of economic growth and social development; aimed at improving the standard of living of all Jordanians.\n\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein married Queen Rania on June 10th, 1993. The Royal Couple has two sons - Prince Hussein, born on June 28th, 1994, and Prince Hashem, born on January 30th 2005 - and two daughters - Princess Iman, born on September 27th, 1996, and Princess Salma, born on September 26th, 2000. The King has four brothers and seven sisters.\n\nInformation courtesy of www.kingabdullah.jo\n\nFor more information on the Royal Family, please visit these websites:\n\nwww.kingabdullah.jo\n\nwww.queenrania.jo"
