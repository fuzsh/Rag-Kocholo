Her title comes from her marriage to the brother of the late King Hussein of Jordan. Over the years she has gained a reputation as one of the most glamorous and best-dressed couture customers on the international social scene. Long known as a hostess in London and Paris (where she maintains homes) she currently lives in New York. An ardent fundraiser who has assisted in a wide variety of Educational and Cultural programs in Jordan and abroad, the Princess is also a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. In October 1999, she became a member of the International Committee of the \"Musses des Arts Decoratifs\" in Paris, as well as a seat on the Chairman's Council of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nShe was a loyal customer at Balmain during Oscar de la Renta’s tenure at the House.
