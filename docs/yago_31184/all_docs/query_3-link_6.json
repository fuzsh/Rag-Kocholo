        "text": "Prince Talal bin Muhammad (born 26 July 1965) is a member of the Jordanian royal family, the eldest son of Prince Muhammad bin Talal, the younger brother of King Hussein of Jordan, and the grandson of King Talal of Jordan. Talal is the 41st generation direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad.[1][2] He has one brother, Prince Ghazi (b. 1966).\n\nBio[]\n\nPrince Talal’s early education took place in Jordan, and from 1975 to 1983 he attended Harrow School in the United Kingdom. In September 1983 he entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom, and upon passing out in April 1984 was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Jordan Arab Army. After a few months in the Jordanian Army, he entered the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, Washington DC in September 1984. He completed the five-year joint degree Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service – Master of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS-MSFS) program, concentrating in International Politics for his BS Degree and US Foreign Policy and Diplomacy for his MS Degree.\n\nAfter undergoing further military training the US and the UK, Talal returned to the Jordanian Armed Forces, where he served as a Company Commander in a Special Forces battalion from March 1990 until March 1991. On 25 March 1991, he was appointed as Military Secretary to King Hussein. In this capacity he functioned as a personal aide to the King, taking the minutes of his meetings and accompanying him daily on his activities within Jordan and his official trips abroad. These duties expanded to charge of the King’s political correspondence and speech writing – Prince Talal co-authored King Hussein’s speech before a Joint Session of the US Congress marking the end of a State of War between Jordan and Israel in July 1994. Talal was further entrusted by King Hussein with intelligence liaison activities and confidential political missions. He was closely involved with the events leading to the signing of the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace in October 1994.\n\nIn addition to this, Prince Talal was appointed by King Hussein as his Personal Representative in the United States in February 1992 – a position he held until the death of King Hussein in February 1999. This involved enhancing relations with the US Administration, Government and Congress following the Gulf War of 1991. Talal also advanced the King’s official trips to the US, arranging his program and topics of discussion with US officials. He would then prepare his talking points, and remain behind in the US after each visit to follow-up any outstanding issues. He was closely involved in securing the forgiveness of Jordan’s $700 million debt to the US and the transfer of a squadron of F-16 fighter aircraft from the US to Jordan following the Washington Declaration of July 1994.\n\nIn August 1996 Prince Talal was appointed by King Hussein as Director of the National Security Council, with the task of establishing the National Security Council of Jordan. Amongst other things, he was responsible for the recruitment, training, and organization of the NSC Staff; the compilation of electronic data bases and Intelnet setup; coordination with the relevant government officials and bodies; intelligence liaison; producing and distributing a daily brief and in-depth studies; and compiling the Agenda for NSC meetings. Following the death of King Hussein, Prince Talal continued to hold this post until August 1999, when King Abdullah II appointed him as his National Security Advisor. He held this post until September 2001 when he was appointed Special Advisor to King Abdullah II.\n\nPrince Talal has also been involved in Higher Education, serving as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Mutah University in Karak, Jordan from 1998 until 2001, and as a member of the Committee of Higher Education (the governmental body responsible for Higher Education in Jordan). He is also a member of the Higher Committee of the Retired Servicemen and Veterans Association, and has served as Chairman of the National Land Mine Removal and Rehabilitation Commission. In 2008, Prince Talal joined the Advisory Board of Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, UK.\n\nTalal has also acted as Regent during absences of King Abdullah II.\n\nIn 1991 he married Princess Ghida Talal (formerly Ghida Salaam), originally of the politically prominent Salaam family of Lebanon. They have three children: Prince Hussein (b. 1999): and Princess Rajaa and Prince Muhammad (b. 2001).\n\nIn addition to his native Arabic, Prince Talal is fluent in English and French. A devout Muslim, he has performed the Hajj (Greater Pilgrimage) to Mecca twice, and the ‘Umrah (Lesser Pilgrimage) more than ten times.\n\nPrince Talal’s sporting interests include Polo, Furusiyya (traditional Arab/Islamic military horsemanship), Scuba Diving (PADI Advanced Diver Rating) Motorcycling, and Alpine Skiing.\n\nEducation[]\n\n1984–1989 Edmund A.
