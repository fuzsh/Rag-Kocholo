        "text": "Miriam Ungría y López is now the member of three noble families. This past weekend, she married Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, a first cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II who is 18th in line to the throne, in a private ceremony at Raghadan Palace on Saturday, September 3, 2022. The two had not even been romantically linked in the press before, so the royal wedding comes as a surprise to most.\n\nAccording to the Royal Hashemite Court, the nuptials were held in the presence of King Abdullah II and attended by Prince El Hassan and Prince Talal. In a statement, they said, \"The Royal Hashemite Court extends its sincere congratulations to His Majesty on this occasion, and wishes Their Royal Highnesses Prince Ghazi and Princess Miriam Ghazi a lifetime of happiness.\" They released a portrait (above) of the newlyweds standing with King Abdullah.\n\nPrincess Miriam De Tirnovo and Prince Kardam of Bulgaria in 2007.\n\nBorn Doña Miriam Ungría y López to a Spanish noble family, Miriam became Princess Miriam of Turnovo during her first marriage to Bulgaria's Prince Kardam. They have two sons, Prince Boris and Prince Beltrán. After Kardam died in 2015 after years in a coma, Boris became heir apparent to the Bulgarian throne. As a royal, Princess Miriam worked as a jewelry designer, and launched her own jewelry line called MdeU, which stands for Miriam de Ungría.\n\nPrince Ghazi bin Muhammad has been married before, too; he married Areej Zawawi in 1997, and they have four children: Princess Tasneem, Prince Abdullah, Princess Jennah, and Princess Salsabeel."
