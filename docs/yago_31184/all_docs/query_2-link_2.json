        "text": "Today marks the 61st birthday of Princess Ghida Talal of Jordan. Fluent in four languages (Arabic, English, French and Spanish), Princess Ghida has had a fascinating life: first as a highly skilled journalist, then as a press secretary, and also as a prominent charity campaigner. Now, as she turns 61, Tatler reflects on the life of the high-powered princess.\n\nRead More\n\nA radiant First Lady: Sir Keir Starmer is Britain's new Prime Minister and his wife Victoria is emerging from her north London cocoon into the global limelight. But who is she?\n\nWho is Lady Starmer? Tatler looks back to a profile published in the January 2023 issue\n\nBorn on 11 July 1963 in Beirut, Lebanon, Ghida Salaam was the eldest of four siblings. She came from a prominent family: her great-grandfather, Salim Ali Salaam, held numerous public positions in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century, including as the Deputy representing Beirut at the Ottoman Parliament.\n\nGrowing up, Princess Ghida attended the Collège Protestant Français, a French international school in Chouran, Beirut. She graduated with French and Lebanese baccalaureates, before moving to the United States for her university years. Settling in Washington, she studied international politics and economics at Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service.\n\nRead More\n\nWho are the Hensons? Meet Olivia Henson's aristocratic family, who have ties to banking empires and the social scene's most sought-after sisters\n\nTwo households, both alike in dignity, in fair Chester where we lay our scene …\n\nAfter completing her studies, Princess Ghida embarked upon a career in journalism with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) News in London. Following this, she became a correspondent in Argentina for the Sunday Times, before moving back to Beirut, where she worked for Reuters, covering the Lebanese war and the country’s convoluted political scene. She then moved on to work for the Financial Times in London, which was her final job as a journalist.\n\nPrincess Ghida married Prince Talal Bin Muhammad of Jordan in 1991. Prince Talal is the eldest son of Prince Muhammad bin Talal, the younger brother of King Hussein of Jordan. He is currently 15th in the line of succession to the Jordanian throne. The couple now live in Jordan with their three children: Prince Hussein (born 1999) and twins Princess Rajaa and Prince Muhammad (born 2001).\n\nIn 2001, the new King Abdullah appointed Princess Ghida as the chair of trustees on the King Hussein Cancer Foundation (one of the most prominent comprehensive cancer centres in the Middle East). Princess Ghida remained active in other pursuits: in 2007, she was part of the Iraq Scholar Rescue Project, which aimed to rescue scholars from Iraq who were being persecuted. She helped them to find places at host universities across Europe and in 2008 was awarded a Humanitarian Award for International Cooperation. In September 2011, she was King Abdullah’s special envoy at the United Nations General Assembly’s High Level Meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), held in New York."
