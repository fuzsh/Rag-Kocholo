        "text": "MARTIN SMITH, Correspondent:\n\nIt is December 2018.\n\nIt’s been less than three months since the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nBut just outside of Riyadh, Saudi leaders and some of their friends are gathered for a celebration.\n\nFeatured is a big electric car race intended to showcase the kinds of reforms underway here.\n\nI have managed to get into the royal box.\n\nThere’s Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister at the time;\n\nMohammed al-Sheikh, a former World Bank lawyer and now a minister of state;\n\nmultibillionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, among the world’s richest men.\n\nAnd over there is Norman Roule, a former senior CIA official.\n\nHe is talking to the world’s largest private collector of Rembrandts, Thomas Kaplan.\n\nAnd of course there’s distinguished royalty: the powerful Mohammed bin Zayed, crown prince of Abu Dhabi;\n\nPrincess Reema, now Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the U.S.;\n\nHis Royal Highness Prince Khalid bin Salman, now deputy minister of defense;\n\nand his big brother, the crown prince himself, Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\nI hope I will do that, but if I do that I would be—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nI came here to understand who he is and where he is taking Saudi Arabia. I especially wanted to speak to him about the Khashoggi murder. But we’ll come back to that later.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\nNow no, but in the first we have—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nFor now, His Royal Highness just wants to watch the race below.\n\nHe wants to put the murder behind him.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMuch is already known about that day last October when Jamal Khashoggi and his fiancee took a taxi to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nHe entered just after 1 p.m. to pick up some paperwork they needed for their wedding.\n\nBut when the office closed and Khashoggi had not emerged, word spread.\n\nRANDA SLIM, Middle East Institute:\n\nHere I was, looking at my Twitter feed, and somebody I follow, who is close to Jamal, saying that Jamal Khashoggi went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and he has not gone out. And I remember retweeting that message, saying, \"WTH\"—what the heck?\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nA prominent Saudi journalist disappeared in Istanbul.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nJamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian citizen and U.S.—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAt the time, Khashoggi was a regular contributor to \"The Washington Post\" and had written many pieces critical of the crown prince.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHe was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nJamal Khashoggi hasn’t been seen since.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL, Princeton University:\n\nI was baffled by the idea that he could walk into a consulate and disappear. I couldn't understand who would do that, because even if you wanted to kill a dissident, or someone that you felt was a dissident, why would you do it in your own consulate? You lose plausible deniability.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe mystery deepens tonight over the fate of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe Saudi government claims that Jamal Khashoggi entered the consulate and left shortly afterwards.\n\nHALA AL-DOSARI, Saudi activist:\n\nEven among Saudis themselves, people were shocked by it. He's not a political opposition. He didn't ever call for ousting the regime. So it's something that was very much unprecedented.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nA Turkish newspaper claimed officials had an audio recording of Khashoggi being tortured—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nMore than a dozen Saudi agents murdered Khashoggi in the consulate.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nKhashoggi’s body was carved up into little pieces.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS, National Public Radio:\n\nIt's one thing to know that he'd been kidnapped. It was another thing to know not only had he been killed, but he'd been tortured. For anybody that you've known for a long time to end that way, it just—just didn't seem right.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSaudi Arabia is scrambling to carry out damage control.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe crown prince himself is the principal suspect.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThis is a man who we’ve been trying to understand and cope with. Is he a modernizer or a tyrant?\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman is now facing greater scrutiny than ever before. So who is the man in charge of Saudi Arabia?\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOur story begins with Prince Mohammed’s father, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. He was born in 1935 and is believed to be the 25th son of the kingdom’s founder. He was appointed governor of Riyadh at a young age, a position he held for almost half a century.\n\nIt was a time of extraordinary change.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL, Central Intelligence Agency, 1977-2006:\n\nSalman as governor of Riyadh literally turned a small desert town into a thriving city. There were maybe 100,000 people living in Riyadh when he became governor back in the 1960s; today it's somewhere around 7 or 8 million people.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIt was during this period of growth that young Mohammed bin Salman, born in 1985, grew up. But little is known about his early years or why his father favored him.\n\nHe had many sons. He picked this particular son, the oldest of his third marriage. Why?\n\nNORMAN ROULE, Central Intelligence Agency, 1983-2017:\n\nI understand that the crown prince and the king have spent an awful lot of time together, and they have a similar way of looking at the world. The king appeared to groom him to share his view on issues such as corruption, the duties of the royal family and the responsibilities to sustain the Al Saud kingdom.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMost young royals study abroad at some point. Not Prince Mohammed. He remained in Riyadh, by his father’s side, through high school and college.\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL, Director, Saudi Intelligence, 1977-2001:\n\nAs I understand it, once he graduated he was employed by his father, working and I assume learning from that work, when his father was the governor.\n\nKAREN ELLIOTT HOUSE, Publisher, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" 2002-06:\n\nApparently that's what he did for some years, was attend all of his father's meetings and make himself useful.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMohammed’s father, while governor, had the responsibility of settling disputes within the royal family.\n\nMADAWI AL-RASHEED, Author, \"Salman's Legacy\":\n\nSo everybody who had a problem with a rival prince or had a dispute, they will go to him. And he was known to be very, very strict in terms of disciplining princes.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nHe was known, for instance, to discipline people that he didn't like, including physically slapping people.\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nHe was, according to the stories, famous for calling in princes who refused to pay bank loans and putting them in a rather luxurious villa and pressuring them to pay what they owed. And they did.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nAnd everything that was buried in the closet, he knew about it. And he had helped sweep it under or get rid of it or fix it or whatever.\n\nThose files, of course, he has now transferred entirely over to his son, who has all of that information going back literally a half century. This gives them enormous influence within the House of Saud, because they know every peccadillo, every fault that every member of the family has had.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn 2015, upon the death of his predecessor, Salman, at age 79, became king. He acted quickly to move his son Prince Mohammed into the line of succession.\n\nFirst, Prince Muqrin, his predecessor’s choice for crown prince, was quickly removed.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nNo explanation was ever offered; he was just removed and replaced by the then-deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef. Mohammed bin Nayef was a known quantity to the Central Intelligence Agency, to MI6, to every intelligence service around the world.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd MBS is moved up behind him?\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nRight.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMBS, or Mohammed bin Salman, was now second in line to the throne. He was 29.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nThe Saudi system is an absolute monarchy. The king's will is absolute. And King Salman decided that MBS is going to be his successor. He shared his views, which are very aggressive, for instance, on Iran; he also has a toughness that I think the king didn't see in others.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhat do you mean by toughness?\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nAn ability to use coercive power if necessary against domestic enemies and regional enemies. I think the king has a view that Saudi Arabia is a country that cannot be ruled, you know, with kid gloves.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMBS wasted little time in putting his toughness on display. Freshly appointed minister of defense, he went on the offensive in neighboring Yemen.\n\nMALE SPEAKER:\n\nAllahu Akbar!\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nA new offensive to drive out Iranian-backed rebels who seized control of the capital and keep military sites.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Houthi rebels in Yemen were advancing with support from Saudi Arabia’s archenemy, Iran.\n\nFor MBS, this was an urgent national security threat.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nOfficials say the Saudi campaign was quickly planned, catching top U.S. military commanders off guard.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe went ahead, giving the Obama administration little notice.\n\nEMILE HOKAYEM, International Institute for Strategic Studies:\n\nSuddenly, MBS comes and he says, \"I'll define our national security interests,\" almost independently. It's not this risk-averse Saudi Arabia that we had gotten used to.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSome elders in the royal family were said to have opposed the offensive, believing it was rash—Crown Prince bin Nayef among them. But young Prince Mohammed prevailed. It became known as MBS’s war.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS:\n\nAnd there was a groundswell of young Saudis that it was like, \"Go, Mohammed, go.\" This is the first time that Saudi Arabia had ever fought in a war like this outside of their own borders, and it was hugely popular because the way that he framed it was, \"Quick, in and out. We'll fix it. Done.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAmong the most ardent supporters of the Yemen campaign was this man.\n\nI toast you.\n\nJamal Khashoggi.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nOh. It is coffee that roasted lightly with cardamom.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAh, with cardamom. And when you drink coffee in Saudi Arabia, where is the coffee from? Is it from Africa?\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nAh. Originally from Yemen, al-Mokha.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nI asked him why the rush to war in Yemen was necessary, especially in light of reports of many civilian casualties.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nIf Saudi Arabia waited for Mr. Obama to approve an intervention in Yemen, Yemen would have been gone and lost a long time ago. It would be controlled by the Iranians and the Houthi. So we did not wait for Mr. Obama’s approval. And I think that empowers Saudi Arabia.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIs Saudi Arabia committing human rights abuses in its bombing campaign?\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nLook, for Saudi Arabia it is a 1939 moment.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSo you’re comparing Iran to Nazi Germany.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nYes. In Saudi Arabia we are at that moment. We either accept Iranian hegemony, control over Yemen and over our destiny, or freedom.\n\nHALA GORANI, Newscaster:\n\nLet’s get more on the Saudi position. I’m joined by Jamal Khashoggi—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAt the time, Khashoggi was not a big critic of the regime.\n\nCHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, Newscaster:\n\nJamal Khashoggi, welcome back to the program.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe was for the most part a pro-government voice.\n\nCHRISTIANE AMANPOUR:\n\nWhat is Saudi Arabia’s aim—\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nJamal was a journalist, an analyst, but also a client of the Saudi government.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAn insider?\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nAbsolutely an insider.\n\nHALA GORANI:\n\nIs Saudi Arabia breaking diplomatically from its allies—\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nHe's someone you went to to understand the politics of the country—\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nThe irony of things is that we are almost in total agreement. All what we need—\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\n—to understand the relationship with Islamism.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nBlowing up himself, that is totally absurd in Islam.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nHe had always worked for one prince or another; was extremely close to Prince Turki al-Faisal, for instance.\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL:\n\nHe was spokesman for the embassy in London and then in Washington when I was ambassador in both.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nRight. Was he ever somebody— did he complain about the kingdom?\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL:\n\nJamal always had ideas, and he was very, very open with those ideas.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nYour Royal Highness.\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nYes.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nFor example, why don’t we support reformers within Iran?\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nMy brother, Jamal—\n\n[Speaking English]\n\nHe was boisterous; he had a good sense of humor, sometimes laughing at himself, sometimes laughing with others. And he was a very professional journalist.\n\nHALA GORANI:\n\nLet’s get another perspective now, from Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He joins me—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn those days Khashoggi was especially enthusiastic about MBS when he talked about the need for reform.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nAnd he is seen as a savior by young Saudis and by me.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nThe fact that you have a new king and a young adviser in the person of Mohammed bin Salman, that gave hope to Jamal.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn 2016, after meeting with MBS, Khashoggi made a point of tweeting this; it’s the only photograph we’ve seen of the two of them together.\n\nI’ve been coming to Saudi Arabia for many years; over that time I witnessed very little change. But in recent years I’ve been surprised.\n\nOne night, in March 2017, I was invited to an art studio. Young men were gathered for an evening of music. This was unusual in a place like Riyadh, where performances like this had long been banned by Saudi clerics.\n\nIn the past, hosting an evening like this could lead to arrests. MBS put an end to that.\n\nMany Saudis knew that the country needed to change, both culturally and economically.\n\nFor years Saudi Arabia has derived most all of its income from oil sales. But oil prices have been falling, the private sector is weak, and youth unemployment is high.\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nIn Saudi Arabia there was very little change; the economy was highly inefficient; women played no role; there was a tremendous amount of corruption. It was exactly the sort of place you would expect if you had a government run by elderly men ruling by consensus.\n\nMOHAMMED AL-SHEIKH, Minister of State:\n\nEvery single developmental plan, and these started in the late '60s, early '70s, had two main sentences in it: \"diversifying the economy away from oil\" and \"less dependence on oil revenues for the government.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIt's always been the case; you've always pushed for that, and you've never gotten there.\n\nMOHAMMED AL-SHEIKH:\n\nWe've always pushed for that, we’ve always talked about that, but we were never able to achieve that. This time we were doing something.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe king gave MBS full rein. It was ambitious beyond anything Saudi Arabia had attempted before.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nToday we have opportunities that are beyond our imagination.\n\nThe challenge is that we are under pressure to achieve something new in a short time.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMBS’s plan was to import Western technology, Western entertainment, and to open up the notoriously closed kingdom to become a world-class tourist destination.\n\nMOHAMMED AL-SHEIKH:\n\nThe crown prince, he has an imagination that I have never experienced anybody with. I'm about 17 years older than he is, but I really look up to him as a leader.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nAnd the most important element of all are the Saudi people, and the will and determination of Saudis.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMany who met the young prince were initially impressed.\n\nKAREN ELLIOTT HOUSE, Author, \"On Saudi Arabia\":\n\nHe was confident, charismatic, decisive, with a vision. Not a plan, but a broad sort of \"there's the lighthouse I have to get to.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYou thought he was a good thing.\n\nKAREN ELLIOTT HOUSE:\n\nI thought he was a good thing. You did say, \"I'm dealing with a different kind of Saudi than anything I've ever seen.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMohammed bin Salman planned to finance his Vision 2030 by taking Saudi Arabia’s oil giant, Saudi Aramco, public in an IPO.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe biggest investment banks in the world have been salivating over the prospects—\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWe are valuating Aramco along with some private firms and banks. We expect the valuation to be more than $2 trillion.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nTo expand the economy, he also needed to introduce some major social reforms.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nHe stops the religious police from having the right to arrest anyone in public for alleged infringement against public morality. Women, for instance, were often targeted for not being appropriately dressed. Religious police can no longer do anything.\n\nFAWZIAH AL-BAKR, King Saud University:\n\nNow you go to the malls, and you’re relaxed. Total segregation that was in place in this society is cracking down. We were hidden, basically, for a very long time, you know, just work in very traditional jobs and within the family protection. So now we’re coming out in every aspect.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd you credit Prince Mohammed?\n\nFAWZIAH AL-BAKR:\n\nFor all this. For all this. And actually King Salman.\n\nALI SHIHABI, Founder, Arabia Foundation, 2017-19:\n\nReforming the religious cultural space; integrating women; these are historic things that leaders were unable to do over the last 50 years.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOut of these changes would come a new Saudi identity.\n\nSTEVEN A. COOK, Council on Foreign Relations:\n\nAs they have reined in the religious police, Mohammed bin Salman and the people around him have de-emphasized religion. And in its place has been this idea of—that nationalism is most important.\n\nMADAWI AL-RASHEED:\n\nThis hypernationalist narrative that Saudi Arabia is great.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN :\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nThe kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in the next five years, will be completely transformed.\n\nMADAWI AL-RASHEED:\n\nIt is in line of what is happening around the world. A new generation of leaders are using the same language and the same rhetoric.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nThe next moment in the world, in the next 30 years, is the Middle East’s moment. This is the war of the Saudis; it's my personal war that I'm waging. I do not want to leave this life before I see the Middle East at the forefront as a global power. And I am 100% sure this goal will be achieved.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMBS, not his father the king or Crown Prince bin Nayef, became the emblem of that new Saudi Arabia both here and abroad.\n\nBut all the changes did not mean that Saudi Arabia would become more politically open or tolerant.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nHe looked like a very pro-Western, pro-technology guy. What I think was never properly interrogated was what kind of political system did he have in mind.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nPolitically minded Saudis didn’t quite know what to expect. But for them, economic and social changes would be meaningless without real political reform.\n\nYAHYA AL-ASSIRI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWhen King Salman took the throne, we were expecting, at least, that the political prisoners would be released. But King Salman was not like his siblings; the trials kept on going, and then new types of repression emerged.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYahya al-Assiri is a prominent human rights activist. I met him at a conference he organized of Saudis in London.\n\nYAHYA AL-ASSIRI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nThank you all for coming to this gathering. This gathering represents everyone. If the regime won’t allow us to get together, we will get together anyway!\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn recent years, increasing numbers of Saudis have left the country—writers, academics and activists of all kinds.\n\nSAHAR AL-FAIFI, Activist:\n\nThe main thing we’re calling for is we want freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement; where the people can have the right of self-determination.\n\nMADAWI AL-RASHEED:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWe know that calling out the regime through our words and our articles is what they fear most. This is why they respond so aggressively.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhat kind of a man is Mohammed bin Salman?\n\nYAHYA AL-ASSIRI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nMohammed bin Salman is a man that wants to get power in the fastest way possible. He used PR to promote himself as a reformer.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn March 2017, Mohammed bin Salman agreed to meet with me in his office at Riyadh’s Irqah Palace. I wanted to talk to him about political reforms.\n\nBut when I got there he talked mostly about his economic plans and the new U.S. president, Donald Trump. I asked for an on-camera interview; he said he wasn’t quite ready.\n\nThe next day, I was surprised to receive a text.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN [via text]:\n\nThis is my number. Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nMARTIN SMITH [via text] :\n\nI really enjoyed our meeting. Trust me I will be in touch.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN [via text]:\n\n??\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMeanwhile, Jamal Khashoggi continued to be sought after as a commentator. After America’s 2016 election, he video conferenced into a U.S. think tank from the Middle East.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nThank you, thank you for inviting me. I’m sure Saudi Arabian officials were caught off guard by the election of Mr. Trump.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHis comments weren’t especially negative, just cautionary.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nIf we had difficulties with somebody like Mr. Obama, I’m sure we will have more difficulties with Mr. Trump.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nHe was advising Gulf governments, including Saudi Arabia, not to put all their eggs in Trump's basket—\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nThe more chaos we have in the region, the more—\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\n—but rather to diversify their relations.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nMr. Trump has to choose. He cannot be critical of the Iran nuclear program and not see the chaos they are creating. It is not just—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIt is not clear if he realized he had crossed a red line. But he had.\n\nIn very clear terms, he told friends and colleagues, Saudi authorities ordered him to no longer write or tweet or appear on TV.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nThis speech in particular was seen by Mohammed bin Salman as likely to be interpreted as being anti-Trump and his inner circle.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSo, \"Don't get between me and the Trump administration.\"\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nYes.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe importance of Donald Trump to the Saudis was made abundantly clear in the way they greeted him in Riyadh in May 2017.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe grandeur of this welcome is so different from past presidents.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nReally just showing how excited this country is that President Trump has chosen Saudi Arabia to make his first stop. And I want to talk about—\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nIt's a huge coup for MBS and King Salman in that it's able to bring the most powerful person in the world to Saudi Arabia and to rekindle the strategic alliance that had frayed under President Obama. So for MBS, this is a massive victory.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Saudis used the trip to influence the president on a variety of issues.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL, Author, \"Kings and Presidents\":\n\nAnd the Saudis knew how to play Donald Trump. They'd seen this kind of person before; in many ways he's kind of a mirror image of many Saudi princes.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nEverywhere you look there are posters welcoming Donald Trump—\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nYou put his picture up on big posters on the side of skyscrapers.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nPretty amazing welcome ceremony that President Trump is receiving—\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nYou put on the sword dance.\n\nYou put on a big display.\n\nMALE ANNOUNCER:\n\nKing Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud confers King Abdulaziz medal on President Donald Trump.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nYou play to his ego and he will do what you want him to do.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhat the Saudis wanted from Trump was U.S. help in beating back Iran and supporting Saudi ambitions to become the dominant player in the Middle East. In return, MBS made promises to help Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS, \"The Washington Post\":\n\nMohammed bin Salman would tell people, \"I see a Middle East that's going to include Israel. I'm prepared to recognize Israel; have trade relationships with Israel.\" And I think that was very seductive to the Trump administration and at the centerpiece of the peace plan that Kushner kept trying to push.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe president and his top aides taking steps to solidify relations with the Muslim world.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nTo give credit to Mohammed bin Salman, of his many sought-after accomplishments, the grooming and wooing of Donald Trump has to be pretty close to the top.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDuring the visit, Trump agreed to an arms deal worth over $100 billion.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\n\nWe signed historic agreements with the kingdom, and we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nFor the Saudis, the trip was a great triumph. They had been reassured that Trump had their back.\n\nAt the exact same time Trump was in Riyadh, I was in Yemen.\n\nThe war was in its third year.\n\nThe Saudis, with U.S. military assistance, were continuing their air campaign. The Iranian-backed Houthi rebels were not retreating. But Prince Mohammed was, as he told me, confident that with just a little more time he could win here.\n\nREFUGEE WOMAN 1:\n\nWe heard bombs, and we can afraid anything, anybody—\n\nREFUGEE BOY:\n\nBig, \"boom,\" like that.\n\nREFUGEE WOMAN 1:\n\nI see the boys of my neighbor is died. And blood on the floor.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nI visited a Yemeni refugee camp.\n\nREFUGEE WOMAN 2:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nThis woman over here, during a wedding in her family people died. They were collecting the hair from the rubble. They were collecting the necks, the arms.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhy are the Saudis doing this?\n\nREFUGEE WOMAN 3:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nOnly God knows. We're just farmers. We don’t have an army base or anything. It's just a village.\n\nREFUGEE WOMAN 2:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nThey destroyed our country, our lives. They killed our kids. Widowed our women. They made our children orphans. Why did these people deserve this? Because of Iran? Iran has a country. Fight them there.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThen, with the war in Yemen at a stalemate, and within weeks of Trump's trip to the region, MBS launched a new foreign policy adventure against another neighbor: the very rich nation of Qatar.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSaudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, among others, broke off diplomatic contact and suspended—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nFor years the Saudis had accused the Qataris of financing terrorist groups and being soft on Iran. Now MBS chose to act.\n\nEMILE HOKAYEM:\n\nWithin a night, Saudi Arabia cut trading routes, transportation into Qatar. They severed diplomatic relations. It was a demand for total capitulation, turning Qatar into a vassal state. It was a very brutal move.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nCountries blockading this nation have sent Qatar a 13-point list of demands—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER :\n\nQatar has been asked to curb diplomatic and trade relations with Iran.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAmong their demands was that Qatar shut down its giant state-owned broadcasting network, Al-Jazeera.\n\nEMILE HOKAYEM:\n\nSaudi Arabia doesn't see why tiny countries like Qatar should have this disproportionate say in the region. So this time, they went for the jugular.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR, Minister of State, Foreign Affairs:\n\nThe Qataris have pushed incitement and extremism through their media platforms in order to destabilize countries. This is why we are saying to the Qataris, \"Enough is enough. This has got to stop if you want to have normal relations with us.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nTrump tweeted his support of the Saudis, seeming to agree with them that Qatar was funding terrorism. “So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit...already paying off.... Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to horror of terrorism!”\n\nWhat Trump seemed to have forgotten is that Qatar is a major U.S. ally that hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East.\n\nTrump tried to negotiate a settlement, but the Qataris would not cave to Saudi demands.\n\nSTEVEN A. COOK, Author, \"False Dawn\":\n\nTo the benefit of the Qataris, they have a tremendous amount of financial resources. They have learned to live without their neighbors; they have weathered the blockade without any kind of major economic problems. They, in fact, have prospered.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut MBS refused to lift the boycott.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nHe wants to be the most important leader who decides on policies of the region. It’s the desire, I think, by MBS to be the dominant regional figure.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMBS was also determined to be the dominant decision-maker at home. One man stood in his way: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef.\n\nOn the night of June 20, two weeks after the attack on Qatar, b in Nayef was summoned by the king. Saudi TV broadcast this carefully choreographed scene.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN NAYEF:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nI pledge allegiance to you. May God support you. I pledge allegiance to you through the best and the worst.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nMay God reward you and prolong your life.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nEssentially, what MBS did was to break the personality and power of MBN as chief rival, humiliate him, and then make a show of kissing Mohammed bin Nayef's ring, as if he was being submissive.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN NAYEF:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nMay God help you.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nMay God prolong your life.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN NAYEF:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nI am relieved now and may God help you.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWe are always in need of your direction and guidance.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN NAYEF:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nGood luck to all.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWe will always seek your guidance.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nMohammed bin Nayef went along with this little bit of choreography only to be moved into effectively house arrest. Now, it's a nice house; it's a palace. But he's held there incommunicado under essentially palace arrest.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe former crown prince was in charge of Saudi Arabia’s security services. He has been relieved of all position.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWithin hours of the news, Trump called Mohammed bin Salman to congratulate him.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nMohammed bin Nayef may have been the CIA's best friend, but he wasn't Donald Trump's best friend, let alone Jared Kushner's. The Trump White House had chosen its Saudi friend, and that was MBS.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOvernight, MBS had engineered a hugely successful maneuver.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAs you understood it, and you're close to the Saudis, how did you understand the need to oust Mohammed bin Nayef?\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nMy sense is that the urgency that the king and the crown prince felt as to the need for changes in the kingdom's economic and political structure was such that it compelled them to make that decision.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWith Mohammed bin Nayef removed, the new crown prince, MBS, was now firmly in charge.\n\nDAVID KIRKPATRICK, \"The New York Times\":\n\nHe became the guy running the royal court; he became the defense minister; and he had also taken over effective control of the interior ministry from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. The whole ball of wax was now in the hands of one man in a way that was really unprecedented.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSaudis were already getting a peek at what MBS’s reforms would look like.\n\nThis fun zone had opened inside a Riyadh mall. Along with all the rides and shops is a big multiplex movie theater showing all the latest features.\n\nCinemas were banned for decades. But now MBS’s plan was to open 350 theaters across the kingdom.\n\nWhat people weren’t seeing at the time was the behind-the-scenes effort to control how much freedom would be allowed.\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nThe changes in the kingdom were going to unleash several different pressures. First, you were going to have thousands of religious police who would say, \"I oppose this.\" You would inevitably also have thousands of other Saudis who would say, \"I want far more than you're willing to give.\" I think the Saudis made a decision that they needed to somehow—somehow manage that.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, two-thirds of the country is under 30, with the largest population of Twitter users in the Middle East.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS:\n\nSaudi was a Twitter country. You know, they expressed themselves on Twitter. They used to call it \"the Saudi Congress.\" And Twitter was fairly open.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut when MBS became crown prince, that would change.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nMBS began to realize that shaping the debate on Twitter, manipulating the debate, intrusively watching what people were writing and thinking, was going to be part of how he would control power.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS:\n\nI think it would be a while before Saudis understood what was happening; that the entire landscape of Twitter in Saudi Arabia was shifting from this open platform where people felt comfortable to express opinions to something that was more like an instrument of oppression.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMBS would pick a close aide, Saud al-Qahtani, to police Twitter. Over time, MBS would rely on him to do much more.\n\nMALE COMPETITION ANNOUNCER:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThat’s him at a large software development competition that he organized in Jeddah.\n\nMALE COMPETITION ANNOUNCER:\n\nSaudi Federation for Cyber Security and Programming, you are officially amazing. Congratulations.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nMohammed bin Salman saw in him the kind of Saudi who's interested in high tech, who knows social media, who can promote, you know, Mohammed bin Salman's profile and visions and ideas through this medium.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nQahtani had one of the most influential Twitter accounts in the kingdom. He is also a poet who has composed verse about the royal family.\n\nMALE POETRY READER:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nOh, my master, my love for you in unique. I always feel proud to be close to you.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nHe is very sharp, very witty. Knows quite a lot about local culture, and knows all the journalists, knows all the intellectuals.\n\nAnd he's very competent. In other words, if you task him with something, he will work very hard, very disciplined, and he will do it.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOne of the things he was tasked to do was to influence opinion on Twitter through hundreds of real or automated fake accounts, or bots.\n\nA cybersecurity expert who has tracked Saudi digital operations is Bill Marczak.\n\nBILL MARCZAK, Citizen Lab:\n\nSaud al-Qahtani, he used a couple of aliases that people were able to trace, and they found him, you know, active on hacker forums bragging about his abilities to create Twitter bots and influence the social media discourse. So you say, \"Oh, well, look, all the tweets, like 80% of the tweets on this hashtag are pro-MBS. Hmmm. Maybe all of Saudi is pro-MBS.\" But in reality, no, there's only a few dozen people behind that.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nQahtani also used Twitter to go after critics, like Sa’ad al-Faqih.\n\nSA’AD AL-FAQIH:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWhy would you accept to live in this oppression? The choice is in your hands to save yourself, your family and live a good life in the future.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nFaqih has been living in exile for decades. Three times a week he records a broadcast for his YouTube channel out of an improvised basement studio in North London.\n\nSA’AD AL-FAQIH:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nSo we pray to God that the fall of Mohammed bin Salman will be an incredible blessing to our nation and to our entire region.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nPeople like Faqih could be bombarded with scores of insults, and sometimes threats, in the space of a few hours. Qahtani’s electronic force became known as \"an army of flies.\"\n\nSA'AD AL-FAQIH:\n\nSaud al-Qahtani, he has got an army. Their job is to face the computer and either write tweets or write comments on YouTube; write comments on Facebook. These comments are directed by him or by his team either to promote the regime or to write things against what we write.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhat's the nature of these comments?\n\nSA'AD AL-FAQIH:\n\nThat is the nature. The nature is that Mohammed bin Salman is a great man, Mohammed bin Salman is a hero, and Dr. al-Faqih and Mr. So-and-So are all traitors.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIs it effective in discrediting you?\n\nSA'AD AL-FAQIH:\n\nIt's not effective in terms of discrediting, but it is effective in terms of intimidation.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Saudis may have even eventually successfully infiltrated Twitter. In 2015, Western intelligence officials learned that the Saudis had developed ties with a Twitter engineer. According to three sources who spoke to \"The New York Times,\" they “persuaded him to peer into several user accounts.” Twitter alerted al-Faqih that he may have been among those targeted.\n\nMARK MAZZETTI, \"The New York Times\":\n\nWe found out that there was an investigation into this Saudi individual actually being a mole of sorts inside Twitter for the royal court.\n\nBILL MARCZAK:\n\nSo being someone inside Twitter, this employee could allegedly access private details of accounts.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd that could be valuable in terms of identifying a network of activists, let's say.\n\nBILL MARCZAK:\n\nAbsolutely. I think to a large extent they sort of know who the activists are. But what are they saying? What are they planning? What's gonna happen next?\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe suspected mole was inside Twitter for around two years.\n\nHow unusual is it for Twitter to have a mole inside the company, downloading private messages and taking profile information?\n\nBILL MARCZAK:\n\nWell, it's the first case we've heard of something like this. This was the first time that Twitter had ever sent out one of these, you know, \"state-sponsored threat messages\" saying, \"Oh, some nation-state is trying to access your account.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAlthough there was no evidence that he shared information with the Saudi government, Twitter, with no public comment, fired the engineer, Ali al-Zabarah. We were unable to reach him.\n\nMARK MAZZETTI:\n\nHe has left the United States, and he is now inside Saudi Arabia, working in an affiliated organization to the royal court.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhile at the royal court’s media office, Qahtani also created a special hashtag on Twitter. It started as a register of all those opposed to Prince Mohammed’s Qatar boycott. But it grew to become much more.\n\n“The official hashtag is #Blacklist. Every name on it will be looked into.”\n\nMADAWI AL-RASHEED:\n\nThe blacklist invites every citizen of Saudi Arabia to become an accomplice in identifying a person to be put on blacklist. Whether it is policy to open up the economy; whether it is about women's driving; or simply about his position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You might have a dispute with someone; you might actually inform the authorities that they are critical of the regime. And this is, basically, the deepest point in repression, when it sinks so much that it makes citizens its own arm in controlling the population.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nA specific blacklist was put together to target journalists. Saudis learned about it on Saudi state TV.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nTwitter followers have reacted to a hashtag called “The Black List for Offensive Journalists.”\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nOn that blacklist were people who Qahtani thought were speaking against the crown prince; speaking against existing power structure in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAs the blacklist expanded, Qahtani made sure everyone knew who was directing him. “Do you think I’m acting on my own whim? I am a civil servant and a faithful executioner of the orders of the King and the Crown Prince.”\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nInteresting thing about MBS is that you'd think with all the power that he'd consolidated, he would have begun to relax. The opposite happened. He seemed to get more hyper, more intense, more committed to going after his enemies, the more powerful he became.\n\nMALE HACKING TEAM ANNOUNCER:\n\nYour target may be outside your monitoring domain. Is passive monitoring enough? You need more.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe royal court also reached out to an Italian surveillance outfit, Hacking Team.\n\nMALE HACKING TEAM ANNOUNCER:\n\nYou have to hack your target. Exactly what we do.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nCompanies that sell hacking and tracking software to governments who want to spy on their citizens is a multimillion-dollar business.\n\nMALE HACKING TEAM ANNOUNCER:\n\nRely on us.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHacking Team received an email from a Saudi address in 2015.\n\n“Considering your esteemed reputation and professionalism, we here at the Center for Media Monitoring and Analysis at the Saudi Royal Court...would like to be in productive cooperation with you...be so kind as to send us the complete list of services that your esteemed company offers. Saud Al-Qahtani.”\n\nWe couldn’t reach Hacking Team. But it was just one of the surveillance companies the Saudis reached out to.\n\nSAHAR AL-FAIFI :\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAt that London conference I attended, dissidents discussed their fears of being surveilled.\n\nYAHYA AL-ASSIRI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nToday, Saudi human rights activists are proud to call themselves human rights activists, but they are afraid of the government—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nToday, the Saudi government has the power to hack any of its citizens.\n\nMADAWI AL-RASHEED:\n\nI’ve noticed that in the last few months so many people who communicate over the internet, phone or email have become so scared.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn May 2018, Yahya al-Assiri received a text message from a source he did not recognize.\n\nYAHYA AL-ASSIRI:\n\nI received a message on my mobile. It said to me, \"You have hearing in front of the Saudi court.\" I was eager to understand what's going on, because I don't have any issue inside any Saudi courts. Then I opened it from my mobile. In the same day, I felt my mobile is very hot and very, very slow.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAl-Assiri was put in touch with Bill Marczak at Citizen Lab.\n\nBILL MARCZAK:\n\nWe were able to both identify the link that he'd received was connected to NSO Group's Pegasus spyware.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nNSO is an Israeli company that develops spyware called Pegasus.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nIt can turn your phone microphone on. It can turn on your phone camera. It turns your earphone into a spy device. It can break any encrypted message on your phone. That's technology MBS got from his new friends, in secret, in Israel.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIs there much an activist like Yahya al-Assiri can do to prevent themselves from being hacked?\n\nBILL MARCZAK:\n\nUnfortunately, there's really not. For these sorts of top-tier targets, when the government is willing to expend essentially unlimited resources to go after these guys, there's really not all that much they can do.\n\nYAHYA AL-ASSIRI:\n\nI know the government can follow up my steps and they know where I am going. And they know where is my office, where is my house. If I take it serious, I must stop my work. I don’t want to stop my work.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nNSO did not comment on Assiri's case but told us it does not tolerate misuse of its software or permit it to be used for spying on critics or journalists.\n\nBack in Saudi Arabia, Jamal Khashoggi had not been able to work for months. He could travel, but he was still banned from writing, tweeting or appearing on TV.\n\nRANDA SLIM :\n\nHe was still hoping that this decree or order will be reversed. So he said, \"Maybe if I toe the line for a while, then they change.\" And then I see him later, and still the order has not been changed. I remember him saying, \"You know, I have to do something about this. Me being at home, not being able to, you know, tweet, write—especially write—is no longer bearable.\"\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nWhat has been described as a coordinated crackdown on dissent in the country, Saudi authorities have carried out arrests of over 40 clerics.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nMore than a dozen prominent women’s activists were arrested, but the—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThen, in September 2017, Mohammed bin Salman’s purges began.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThey arrested a huge number of liberal-minded reformers—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDozens of men and women—writers, academics, businesspeople and an economist—were rounded up.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe crown prince is clear: Anybody who goes against him, they’re in trouble—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nEssam al-Zamil had just returned from the U.S., where he had been part of an official Saudi delegation.\n\nESSAM AL-ZAMIL:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nVision 2030 is extremely important for—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut in a series of posts on social media, he had cast doubt on Prince Mohammed’s valuation of a Saudi Aramco IPO.\n\nESSAM AL-ZAMIL:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nAramco's value can never reach two or three trillion dollars—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThat would lead to his arrest.\n\nAfter a year in prison he was charged for “seeking to stir up sedition in the kingdom through his Twitter account.”\n\nProminent religious figures were also arrested. One of the most well-known was Salman Alaoudh.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAmong those outside of the official clerical establishment, does anyone compare to your father in terms of popularity?\n\nABDULLAH ALAOUDH, Georgetown University:\n\nNone whatsoever. I mean, he's being followed by 14 million followers; the king has 6 or 7 million followers.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAt the time of his arrest, the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar was in its third month. In this tweet Alaoudh expressed hope that the two leaders—MBS and the emir of Qatar—could be reconciled.\n\nABDULLAH ALAOUDH:\n\nHe was just praying. And they said literally to him, \"Neutrality in this crisis is treason.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThat led to his arrest, in fact.\n\nABDULLAH ALAOUDH:\n\nYeah. That's why they are seeking death penalty against him right now. For Mohammed bin Salman, these are threats to his absolute authority.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAlaoudh was charged with a total of 37 offenses, including “spreading discord and inciting against the ruler.”\n\nDAVID KIRKPATRICK:\n\nHe was probably the foremost figure in Saudi Arabia associated with a kind of religious reform current that leaned towards democracy. So whatever the kingdom says they've arrested him for, they've really arrested him for being Salman Alaoudh.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nTell me how your father was treated when he was arrested.\n\nABDULLAH ALAOUDH:\n\nHe was treated really, really badly, He was blindfolded; handcuffed all the time, even in the cell; chains were put on his feet. He was interrogated for days continuously without allowing him to sleep.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAs reports of the arrests appeared, Jamal Khashoggi’s name began surfacing in articles. An editor at \"The Washington Post\" took notice.\n\nKAREN ATTIAH, \"The Washington Post\":\n\nWe were hearing the reports about the crackdown and I saw Jamal Khashoggi's name being quoted a few pieces about the situation. And I just figured, \"Well, why not reach out to him?\" And so I gave him a call.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nKhashoggi had recently left Saudi Arabia. When he'd settled in D.C., I sat down to talk with him. Before all our cameras were rolling he spoke personally for a moment. He told me he was uncertain about what he would do here.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\nSo basically, what I'm doing right now is just restructuring my life. I don't want to be a dissident, but in the same time, I don't want to go back home and be—\n\nMARTIN SMITH :\n\nMuzzled.\n\nJAMAL KHASHOGGI:\n\n—silent again. And also I could be banned from traveling.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSoon after, Khashoggi decided what to do. He published his first column in \"The Washington Post.\"\n\n“Saudi Arabia wasn’t always this repressive. Now it’s unbearable.”\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nHe was upset when Salman Alaoudh was arrested. He was upset when other activists was arrested. And he kept saying, \"These are moderate people; these are not the extremists. And they are arresting the moderate people.\"\n\nKAREN ATTIAH:\n\nI think he was in some ways confused about the situation. I mean, he really supported the vision of the reforms that Mohammed bin Salman had. I mean, it was a very personal essay. You see that he was wrestling with his decision to speak out or not.\n\nAnd we decided to translate it into Arabic so that people in the whole Arab world could read it.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDid you recognize at that point that there was any danger in this for him?\n\nKAREN ATTIAH:\n\nMortal danger? No. Personal sacrifices? Yes, of course.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThen came November.\n\nFirst, the prime minister of Lebanon, Saad Hariri, was ordered to come to Riyadh.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nHe was asked to come to the palace for a meeting, and he was taken away, put in a room.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe's handcuffed, he's—\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nHe’s slapped, he’s maltreated.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Saudis charged that Hariri had not done enough to counter Iranian influence in Lebanon.\n\nSAAD HARIRI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nTo the great Lebanese people—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe was put on a Saudi TV channel reading a resignation letter.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nA truly remarkable event. Prime Minister Hariri is essentially ordered, more or less at gunpoint, to give up his job.\n\nSAAD HARIRI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWithout a doubt to Iran, which does not—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe says he was resigning because Iran was interfering in Lebanon and fomenting “discord and destruction” in the region.\n\nSAAD HARIRI:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\n—this is proven by Iran's intervention in the internal affairs of the Arab countries.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nThe kind of aggressive tone against Iran is not something that Hariri has endorsed or will endorse. And so they knew it was a forced resignation.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe was eventually released and would rescind his resignation.\n\nBut there was more.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nMohammed bin Salman is flexing his political muscle in ways not seen before—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOn the very same day Hariri was detained, MBS began rounding up 200 of the kingdom’s richest businessmen and most powerful princes.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThese are incredible times in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSome of the detainees reportedly held here, Riyadh’s glamorous Ritz-Carlton.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\n—especially the older guard, are extremely worried by these changes that are happening—\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nThe Ritz was, in essence, the big bang. It brought in a massive number of people; they were presented with very detailed files of their financial shenanigans and were in essence told, \"You need to repay what you have taken from the kingdom by exploiting your position or your contacts.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd if they pushed back or they refused to pay, what was the consequence?\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nThey didn't leave.\n\nALI SHIHABI:\n\nI have a personal friend who was arrested.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWho was that?\n\nALI SHIHABI:\n\nI'm not going to name him, but I mean, he went through in detail. He brought to the Ritz at 4 a.m. in the morning. He said it was extremely well-organized. They checked him in, gave him a medical test, asked him if he had any medicines that he needed and then gave him a room where the door had to be kept open. But he had full access to room service and a TV. And he was interrogated I think for a month.\n\nAnd then he was released. Now, I don't know if he settled anything, but by standards—frankly, I would have rather been arrested like him than be arrested in a jail in America.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThey say it’s all about corruption. I really don’t believe that.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThere are others who are whispering about whether this is really about a consolidation of power.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nCorruption was pervasive in the kingdom.\n\nHow can you describe the level of corruption that you were facing, that you were confronted with? How do you make the point?\n\nMOHAMMED AL-SHEIKH:\n\nIt was so bad that it was actually truly impacting the development of the country. We're talking about billions and billions and billions of dollars. And when we looked at all the various options, this was probably the best option available. Was it perfect? Absolutely not.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nPresident Trump condoned the round-up.\n\nBut for Jamal Khashoggi, it wasn’t just about corruption.\n\n“What is absolutely clear after Saturday’s 'Night of the Long Knives' is that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is centralizing all power within his position as crown prince.\"\n\nKAREN ATTIAH :\n\nHe likened MBS to to Putin. He just saw things getting worse and worse and worse.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe was very upset by the events at the Ritz-Carlton.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nAnd especially by what happened to Waleed bin Talal.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAl-Waleed bin Talal, a longtime friend and supporter of Khashoggi’s and Saudi Arabia’s most famous investor.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nJamal Khashoggi’s feeling was, as he would refer to MBS, \"If this kid was able to go that far and arrest somebody like Waleed bin Talal,\" you know, then there are no bounds to what he's going to do to people like him.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut it would take time for the rest of the world to understand the Ritz-Carlton purge as Khashoggi had.\n\nPrince Al-Waleed was held for 83 days.\n\nMALE INTERVIEWER:\n\nWhat was it like, Your Royal Highness, being held captive by your own cousin?\n\nAL-WALEED BIN TALAL:\n\nFrankly speaking, it was not easy, you know, I have to confess that—to be held against your will.\n\nMALE INTERVIEWER:\n\nHow would you describe your relationship?\n\nAL-WALEED BIN TALAL :\n\nNo one will believe it. My relationship right now with Prince Mohammed bin Salman, this guy, is not only as strong as before—stronger. And this is shocking to many people.\n\nMALE INTERVIEWER:\n\nYou’ve forgiven him?\n\nAL-WALEED BIN TALAL:\n\nI didn’t say \"forgiven.\" I forgot, and forgiven the whole process completely; it's behind me completely. Completely.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nReports of the Ritz indicate that the Saudi government tortured detainees, and coerced—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut as other people were released, reports of abuse and torture seeped out to the press.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nInmates required to sign over their fortunes in order to be released—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nFamily members of detainees have told reporters that MBS’s close aide, Saud al-Qahtani, acted as their interrogator.\n\nMARK MAZZETTI:\n\nWhat's been pretty clear is that he played a principal role in the Ritz-Carlton being turned into this gold-plated prison. There were gradations of treatment and the death of at least one person in custody, a general. The story was that he died of a heart attack, but according to family members, he had been beaten severely.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThere were reports of harsh treatment, beatings and even death.\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL :\n\nI heard those reports, but I've never seen any reflection of that.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYou have no suspicion about beatings?\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL :\n\nNone whatsoever. None whatsoever. And the fact, that these people were put up in the Ritz-Carlton to me indicates that the intention is not to inflict physical or emotional harm on them. But rather to get to the truth.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDo you believe anybody was coerced physically at the Ritz-Carlton?\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nI don't know.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIt's possible.\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nAnything is possible. All I can say is that the exercise was to bring in very senior members of the Saudi financial business community and say, “You have money which doesn't belong to you; it belongs to the Saudi people. We would like that back. Now go out and live your life the way you did previously.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nEasier said than done.\n\nKAREN ELLIOTT HOUSE, Harvard Kennedy School of Government:\n\nYou know, now, ministers and princes and big business people are locked up. Even once they're let out. I'm told, at least, most of them have ankle bracelets; they cannot fly. They have been publicly humiliated and put under constant observation.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nJust after the Ritz-Carlton arrests, I had asked MBS again to sit down for an interview.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN [via text]:\n\nI can’t do on record now but you know you are welcome anytime to talk about anything...\n\nMARTIN SMITH [via text]:\n\nWell, good to hear back. Thanks. I will think about whether an off the record interview is helpful.\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN [via text]:\n\nAnytime, just let me know\n\nMARTIN SMITH [via text]:\n\nI will add that the entire world is waiting to hear the answers only you can give.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMeanwhile, MBS’s war in Yemen had gone from bad to worse.\n\nIn November 2017, after a Houthi missile landed near Riyadh, the Saudis imposed a blockade, making it impossible for food or fuel to get through.\n\nTwo-thirds of the country’s population was already facing food shortages; hospitals were overwhelmed with an outbreak of cholera.\n\nAfter international pressure, the Saudis eased the blockade. But civilian casualties from air attacks and land mines continued to mount.\n\nFEMALE TRANSLATOR:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nCan you tell me what happened?\n\nGIRL IN HOSPITAL BED:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nI was walking, and then the mine exploded. My leg was amputated immediately.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSpokesman for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri.\n\nAHMED AL-ASSIRI:\n\nLet me tell you something: When you conduct a military operation, mistake would happen. And there is no single allegation we does not investigate.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDo you have a count of the number of civilian deaths that have resulted from your operations? How many civilians have died as a result—\n\nAHMED AL-ASSIRI:\n\nNo, we don't have numbers of civilian death—of cause of the—the Yemeni government have this.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOK, what was their number?\n\nAHMED AL-ASSIRI:\n\nAsk the Yemeni government.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBy the end of 2017, thousands of civilians had already been killed, many more wounded.\n\nDespite the rising death toll, when Prince Mohammed arrived at the White House a few months later, President Trump was pushing him to buy more weapons.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\n\nWe make the best military product in the world. Whether it’s missiles or planes or anything else, there's nobody that even comes close.\n\nSome of the things that have been approved and are currently under construction and will be delivered to Saudi Arabia very soon, and that’s for their protection; but if you look in terms of dollars—$3 billion, $533 million, $525 million—that’s peanuts for you, should have increased it—$880 million—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe visit was the beginning of a nearly three-week tour of the U.S.\n\nEven with his purges and the war in Yemen, Prince Mohammed’s popularity as a reformer was reaching its peak.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nYou'll remember, he came to the United States and was lauded, literally from coast to coast.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHe will have visited five states, four presidents, five newspapers, uncounted moguls and Oprah.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nHe was praised as a revolutionary; as the Saudi reformer; as the head of what would be the Saudi Spring.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nShould America, should the world buy what the crown prince is selling?\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHe seems to be sincere.\n\nAMBASSADOR MARTIN INDYK, Council on Foreign Relations:\n\nIt was a major PR operation. Part of that operation was Wall Street titans, Silicon Valley and Hollywood.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS:\n\nThe tech people, the movie people—their eyes were quite glittering. There was this new opening of people who hadn’t made money there before.\n\nHALA AL-DOSARI:\n\nPeople were mesmerized.\n\nMALE NEWS ANCHOR:\n\nYou did have this sit-down with MBS, the first interview with him—\n\nHALA AL-DOSARI:\n\nNotable journalists in the U.S.—Thomas Friedman has actually embraced him big time.\n\nTHOMAS FRIEDMAN:\n\nHe’s not just leading this from the top down, whoa! It is exploding from the bottom up.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe also made a point of meeting with Jewish American groups in New York.\n\nMARTIN INDYK:\n\nTo win the support of Jewish leadership, he needed to say something different about Israel and about the Palestinians. And he did.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe crown prince says that the Israelis should have the right to their own land. This will be the prelude of a new era, a new relationship between Saudi Arabia and Israel—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe also granted his first-ever American TV interview to \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL:\n\nHis reforms inside Saudi Arabia have been revolutionary.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nMBS brought his media adviser along with him: Saud al-Qahtani.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL:\n\nAre women equal to men?\n\nMOHAMMED BIN SALMAN :\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nAbsolutely—we are all human beings, and there’s no difference.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHe’s pushing through reforms that have expanded freedoms, including those of women; he’s a fierce opponent of Iran—\n\nHALA AL-DOSARI:\n\nHe said, \"Women are equal to men. We're gonna lift the women driving ban. We're gonna allow more women in leadership position.\" So he's saying all the right things, but you can only deceive people that far.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nShortly after his return home, the ban against women driving was due to be lifted.\n\nOne of the activists who had campaigned for it was Loujain al-Hathloul.\n\nLOUJAIN AL-HATHLOUL:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nI am now on Ghweifat Highway, trying to cross over the Saudi border.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nShe made headlines in 2014 when she posted a video of herself driving from the UAE to Saudi Arabia.\n\nLOUJAIN AL-HATHLOUL:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\n—let’s see what happens.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nShe was arrested and held for 73 days in a Saudi jail, and then released.\n\nBut as Saudi women waited for the driving ban to end, the royal court ordered Loujain to be rearrested along with other prominent women’s rights activists.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nWe are very much concerned about what's going on in Saudi Arabia right now.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSecurity forces swept up one of the kingdom's early feminists—\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\n—but it has come at the cost—\n\nMADAWI AL-RASHEED:\n\nI think Mohammed bin Salman realized that the women’s movement in Saudi Arabia is not simply about driving, it’s about rights, and they were not going to stop at driving a car. The car was a symbol of their oppression.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWe spoke to Loujain al-Hathloul’s sister from her home outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nALIA AL-HATHLOUL, Sister of Loujain al-Hathloul:\n\nWhen I learned that Loujain was arrested, I was so scared. It was in the middle of the day. Five men and five women came. They were blocking the street, so all neighbors witnessed what happened. My parents, they were extremely panicked. My mom said, \"Why you are arresting my daughter?\" But they just went up and they grab her from her bedroom; they—they took her.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe other arrests were similarly staged.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThey are telling the women a message that you should not ask for more rights.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS:\n\nWhen they went to Hatoon al-Fassi's house they brought klieg lights and and lit up the neighborhood. And they did it in front of her children. They don't—they don't do that. Jamal was the one who showed me the Saudi newspaper that has all of their faces and \"Traitor, traitor, traitor.\" I mean, I cannot tell you how shocking that was.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAt least 12 women and three men were put on trial because of their activism; human rights groups believe the number to be much higher.\n\nKhashoggi wrote, \"Repression and intimidation are not—and never should be—the acceptable companions of reform.\" He urged MBS to order the release of Hathloul and the other women who campaigned for women’s right to drive.\n\nBut they were not released. Hathloul’s parents were not allowed to start visiting her until months later.\n\nALIA AL-HATHLOUL:\n\nMy mom and my father went to Jeddah; they took the plane to visit Loujain at Dhahban Prison. When they saw her she was weak, very weak, and there was red marks over her face. They asked her, \"Did they torture you?\" And she said—she said, \"No, I am fine, you know. Don’t worry about me.\" And they insisted. And after that she just start crying, crying, crying; she couldn't stop. And at moment she stopped—she start breathing, and she showed them her thighs. And it was not only bruises; it was burns; it was so dark. And she said, \"They were going to throw me in the sewage system.\" And they were repeating this to her; she thought she was going to die. And during the torture session, she recognized specifically one man, and he is a highly ranked adviser.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWho was that?\n\nALIA AL-HATHLOUL:\n\nHis name is known everywhere. It was Saud al-Qahtani.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSome of the other women arrested also endured torture: Samar Badawi, Aziza al-Yousef, Eman al-Nafjan, Shadan al-Onezi and Nouf al-Dosari. There are also reports of sexual harassment and assault. Details were sent by multiple sources to human rights groups outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nHALA AL-DOSARI:\n\nThe statement that we got from many of the sources, that all of the women were tortured. And placed, of course, in solitary confinement. Women would be stripped naked and assaulted sexually; they would be beaten, electrocuted. To see those women who have for years been really a source of strength for other women, to see them treated this way—for me, I know these women. I know how dignified, how caring and concerned about their country they are. There is no other way, except that they want to put them into a position where they're completely broken and silenced.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nQahtani has not commented on any torture allegations. Al-Hathloul attempted to report her torture to officers of the Saudi Human Rights Commission who had visited her in prison.\n\nALIA AL-HATHLOUL:\n\nThe Human Rights Commission visited her. And she said, \"Are you going to protect me?\" Because she gave them the name of Saud al-Qahtani, and she is so scared of that. They said, \"Of course we can't.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWe cannot.\n\nALIA AL-HATHLOUL:\n\nWe cannot, no; of course we cannot.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nI tried to call the Human Rights Commission to get a comment; they didn’t respond.\n\nWe decided to just go over there.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nIs Dr. Aiban here? I am a journalist.\n\nGUARD 1:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nNo.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nNo? No. OK?\n\n[Speaking English]\n\nI was ushered into what I hoped was Dr. Aiban’s office; he heads the Human Rights Commission.\n\nThey don’t know what to do with us.\n\nHello!\n\nAZIZ, Translator:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nSabah al-noor.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nFinally, I was greeted by a translator, Aziz, and an office assistant.\n\nAs you know, there’s lots of controversy right now about the handling of prisoners, and we wanted to ask questions about the conditions in the prisons, about the conditions for the women particularly.\n\nAZIZ:\n\nDr. Bandar, I think, is the best to answer such questions.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOK, is he here?\n\nAZIZ:\n\nWe are trying to—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe’s trying to call him.\n\nWhy is it so difficult to get an appointment to see Dr. Aiban?\n\nAZIZ:\n\nMe, myself, I don’t know. Really. Really.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDespite it being a workday, I got nowhere.\n\nMALE OFFICE ASSISTANT:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nWe will try to get them an appointment and we will call them.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWell, good luck to you.\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nGoodbye.\n\n[Speaking English]\n\nI never received a call back. But I kept trying.\n\n[on telephone]\n\nHello?\n\nHello? Yeah. I am looking to speak to Dr. Aiban.\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nDr. Aiban, please?\n\nDr. Aiban!\n\nNumber's wrong? OK, thank you.\n\nFEMALE VOICE ON PHONE:\n\nHallo?\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYes, hi. I want to speak with Dr. Aiban—\n\nI also tried to contact the public prosecutor and the minister of justice.\n\nBy the time I spoke to Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, eight months had gone by since Hathloul and the other women were arrested.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nWe refuse the charge of torture. I don't believe that's the case. The prosecutor has said this. And I think the procedures—legal procedures in Saudi Arabia have to play out.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThey've been held without trial.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nWell, they will be going through the courts. They are not activists. There's evidence of links to foreign entities. There's evidence of attempting to recruit people in sensitive positions.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThat's the charge, but that hasn't been proven.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nIt will be proven in court.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWho do you hold responsible for what's happened to your sister?\n\nALIA AL-HATHLOUL:\n\nGood question. I have some idea, but I don't know if I can share it.\n\nEvery time I talk, every time I accept to be interviewed, I have to see if there are consequences on me, on my sister, my family.\n\nSaudi Arabia was never a democracy. However, it was never a police state. And I feel it's becoming kind of a police state, unfortunately.\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nThe Saudi government never went after family members. Now the system is actually engaged in collective forms of punishment.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn D.C., Khashoggi was also feeling the wrath of MBS. His son Salah, the only one of his children still in Saudi Arabia, had been forbidden to travel.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS :\n\nOne of the first things he said to me is, \"They've put my son on a travel ban. And it's just not fair. He's not political at all. And there's nothing I can do about it.\"\n\nHALA AL-DOSARI:\n\nAnd my understanding is that he sent a message to Saud al-Qahtani, telling him, \"This has come to very low standards that you are now going after my son.\" But he received no response from Saud al-Qahtani.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHis wife, fearing for her and her family’s safety, asked for a divorce.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nAnd that was—that was extremely painful to him.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nJamal was also being harassed on Twitter by Qahtani’s notorious army of flies.\n\nDEBORAH AMOS:\n\nWhat we talked about is, did I know anybody at Twitter to turn it off?\n\nIt was the bots; the army; the flies.\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nI can say that there was certainly a sense of animus towards Jamal Khashoggi because of his unrelenting criticism of the kingdom in a national newspaper in the capital of the Saudis' closest partner.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nAnd I think MBS felt genuinely threatened by this \"Washington Post\"-supported journalist who was criticizing MBS himself personally.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nHe talked about the kind of threats he was getting, but he was also heartened by the positive feedback he was getting from Saudis he never met; and people reaching out to him and saying, \"Yes, you are doing the right thing; yes, you are speaking on all of our behalf. Thank you for doing what you are doing.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd he had, with time, found a new love, someone who shared his interest in Arab politics: a Turkish academic, Hatice Cengiz.\n\nRANDA SLIM:\n\nWhen I saw him the last time, he was happy. He said, \"Well, I'm thinking I'm going to spend more time in Turkey now.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd he kept writing about the prince he had once supported.\n\nKAREN ATTIAH:\n\nI think his ultimate desire was to see his people enjoy some of the same freedoms that he had here, in Washington, in the U.S.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe submitted his last article on Sept. 28, 2018.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nOver time, I think Jamal felt more and more that independent journalism was the way to achieve what he'd wanted since he was a young man.\n\nGeorge Orwell gave as a title of a column that he wrote \"As I Please\"—you know, \"I write as I please.\"\n\nJamal Khashoggi was a version of that. He was somebody who wrote what he thought; wrote what he believed.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDo you think Jamal had any idea that he was playing with fire?\n\nBERNARD HAYKEL:\n\nI think that Jamal hadn't fully realized how different the system had become. I think that he thought that this was a regime that didn't draw blood unnecessarily; that did not kill dissidents overseas. And I think he was wrong. He misjudged how things had changed.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHe was last seen in Istanbul. Angela, where do you think he’s gone to?\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nWell, this is the question that everybody is asking. Jamal Khashoggi; he went missing on Tuesday; he went to the consulate building of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSpeaking on Turkish television, Ms. Cengiz explained he was going to the consulate to collect documents for the marriage, and for that she felt—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe murder took place on Oct. 2. Four days later, the Saudi consul general gave a reporter a tour of the consulate.\n\nThe Saudis’ story was that Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive.\n\nMOHAMMED AL-OTAIBI, Consul General:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nI would like to assure you that the citizen Jamal is not at the consulate, and the embassy is working to search for him. And we are worried about his case.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Saudis were saying he had gone missing somewhere in Turkey. Turkish officials were furious.\n\nRAGIP SOYLU, Middle East Eye:\n\nThey’re like, instead of their providing answers to us, they're actually saying that, “Uh oh, it's your problem now. He's missing in Turkey.\" That was the tipping point for Turkish officials.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAt the pro-government Turkish newspaper, \"Sabah,\" reporters started getting details from Turkish intelligence and the police. Nazif Karaman.\n\nNAZIF KARAMAN:\n\n[Speaking Turkish]\n\nSoon, we received information from one of our sources about two passenger jets which were owned by the Saudi government and used in this case.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBy the time the reporters had learned about the two Saudi planes, the jets had left Istanbul.\n\nThen they were told more. Abdurrahman Şimşek.\n\nABDURRAHMAN ŞIMŞEK:\n\n[Speaking Turkish]\n\nWe were informed that Khashoggi was subjected to a cruel murder. I asked them how can that happen and what kind of savagery are you talking about? Such a thing was not possible. Such a murder in a diplomatic building. I didn't believe it at first.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYasin Aktay, adviser to Turkey’s President Erdogan, heard details of the murder.\n\nWhen you learned that the police had concluded that he had been murdered. Can you describe that moment?\n\nYASIN AKTAY:\n\nThat moment was very, very difficult for me. They said me, \"They are animals. They are animals. They're worse than animals. They killed him like dogs, and they—\" He was crying. And I cried.\n\nRAGIP SOYLU:\n\nI just couldn't come to myself for a couple of minutes. I just couldn't believe the fact that they cut him into pieces.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nI texted MBS.\n\n[via text]\n\nHello sir. Martin here. What can you tell us about Khashoggi? Anything?\n\n[via text]\n\nTurks are saying he was killed in your consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThere was no response. I tried again.\n\n[via text]\n\nI am not sure how to interpret your silence. Do you believe that Jamal is alive?\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDid you know Jamal Khashoggi?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nYes. I've known him since the late '80s.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd what kind of man was he?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nHe was a journalist; he was an editor; he was a kind person. And he was—he had family, he had children.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd what happened to him?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nHe was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in what is a huge mistake that has shocked the whole country. And that we have expressed our commitment to hold those accountable, and to make sure work on procedures to reform the security services so that we minimize the occurrence of such a tragic mistake in the future.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nJubeir says they are committed to investigating what happened. But from the beginning, the Saudis tried to cover it up.\n\nASLI AYDINTAŞBAŞ, Contributor, \"The Washington Post\":\n\nThe Saudis' story kept changing over the course of two weeks. The inconsistencies were really clear.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThis is one of the most peculiar, perplexing news events that I can recall in some time—\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe evidence keeps building: Newly released video shows a Saudi man who looks a little like Khashoggi—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHere’s he’s caught on CCTV arriving at the consulate wearing a—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSurveillance footage showed how the team initially tried to fool the police into believing Khashoggi left the consulate alive.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\n—he walks outside, in Khashoggi’s clothes and glasses.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut the police immediately spotted what was a body double.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSame clothes, same glasses, same beard, same age and build. Everything but the shoes.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhy did the double not take Khashoggi's shoes?\n\nFERHAT KALEMINDEN, \"Sabah\":\n\nHe took the shoes, actually, but he couldn’t—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThey wouldn't fit?\n\nFERHAT KALEMINDEN:\n\nYeah, and head of the Istanbul police, he realized that the, you know, shoes is different.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Saudis had clung to the lie that Khashoggi was alive.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nIt’s more drip-fed uncorroboratable intelligence that has sent Riyadh into a panic.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThen Turkish intelligence revealed they had audio tapes.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nTurkish and U.S. officials said the recordings offer proof that Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe details revealed were gruesome; the audio was not released to the public. But some reporters learned about its contents.\n\nASLI AYDINTAŞBAŞ:\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's something that could really be shared with the public because it just involves so much violence, even though it's just an audio recording.\n\nABDURRAHMAN ŞIMŞEK:\n\n[Speaking Turkish]\n\nThey made Jamal Khashoggi sit on a chair and then held his hands from the back. Five people were holding his knees and legs, and somebody puts the bag on his head from the back. Tubaygi, who is the head of forensic institute, was watching him being suffocated from across the room. Five people on top of Khashoggi to suffocate him. He’s saying, “I am suffocating; let me go, I cannot breathe.\" But his decapitators took his life in less than five minutes.\n\nFEMALE REPORTER:\n\nHave you heard that tape? And does it conclusively point to the crown prince as ordering the killing of Jamal Khashoggi?\n\nJOHN BOLTON:\n\nNo, I haven’t listened to it. And I guess I should ask you: Why do you think I should? What do you think I’ll learn from it? Unless you speak Arabic, what are you going to get from it?\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWithin a week, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Jared Kushner had called Riyadh. Soon after, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Saudi Arabia to meet with the crown prince.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for Prince Mohammed’s involvement was tightening.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nAfter weeks of denials, Saudi Arabia is changing its tune.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSaudi Arabia now going further, admitting that the killing looks to have been premeditated.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThese were not low-ranking figures, so they couldn’t have done what they did oblivious to the prince, could they?\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Turkish media had identified all 15 of the Saudis who flew into Istanbul.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nWho are these people who are on this 15-man team? One of whom, a forensics autopsy expert—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nFive of them are reported to have worked under MBS’s aide Saud al-Qahtani at the royal court.\n\nAnd one key team member was on the crown prince’s personal security detail—the alleged ringleader on the ground, Maher Mutreb.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nOne man, Maher Mutreb, he’s been seen traveling with the crown prince all over the world, potentially as a bodyguard—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nAfter the murder, the Saudis called MBS’s private office. It's inconceivable that Mohammed bin Salman didn’t know—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYou went on television on FOX News on Oct. 21 and you said that none of those involved in Khashoggi's death had close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nBecause he has—Prince Mo—these were security individuals. Security people have rotations; they sometimes serve for specific times in terms of security or other issues.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut these weren't just security individuals. Mutreb, who traveled extensively with the crown prince, including in the United States, was on the scene. Are you saying that you didn't know that the people that were involved in the murder were close to the crown prince at the time that you said that?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nThey—the crown prince has a lot of people who are close to him or who claim to be close to him. He has a lot of people who take their pictures with him—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThen I asked about Qahtani; Qahtani allegedly ran the operation from outside Turkey.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nQahtani wasn't just one of a lot of people.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nLook, this is—you’re asking all these questions\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHe's a—he was a close aide to the crown prince. Where is he now?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nYou should ask the public prosecutor.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe public prosecutor won't talk to us.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nThen—then—you should call him again.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHow is it possible that Mohammed bin Salman did not know of this operation?\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nWell, I have stated that I believe it's very unlikely he did not know of at least a rendition.I can easily imagine that the decision making might've been as simple as Saud al-Qahtani saying, \"We have this dissident. We will conduct a rendition operation from Istanbul,\" and being told, \"Go ahead.\"\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nSo you have contacts within Saudi Arabia at high levels that tell you that this was a rendition.\n\nNORMAN ROULE:\n\nYes.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut the Saudis insist MBS gave no such authorization. They say it was a rogue operation.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYou're saying that this is being investigated by the public prosecutor?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nYes.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut at the same time, you have declared it a rogue operation. So you've reached a conclusion that this was a rogue operation before the investigation is complete.\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nOf course it's a rogue operation. Nobody authorized this. Who would authorize the murder of a citizen in our own consulate?\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHow do we know until there is an investigation?\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nIt seems to me that you have made up your mind before you watched the due process—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nNo, you've made up your mind that it's a rogue operation—\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nIt is a rogue operation because there is no authorization for them to commit this crime. There was no authorization for them to commit this crime. That's why it's a rogue operation.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHow do we know that this was a rogue operation? You say it's a rogue operation.\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL:\n\nAh, because our leadership says it was a rogue operation, and our leadership has not lied to us before. So we believe them.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThere were a series of statements made immediately after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi that have proven to be false, that have proven to be lies.\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL:\n\nThat were based on reporting by this rogue element. And they're going to be taken to court and face their fate.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThe Saudis have been unclear about who authorized the operation. But they have said one man, Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, the former spokesman for MBS’s war in Yemen, was involved in the planning.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nYou know Gen. Assiri.\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nYes.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nDo you think he's in any way capable of mounting an operation like this?\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nOn his own? Absolutely not. He wouldn't dream up a plot like this. This is a servant of the state, used to taking orders. It's just not in the nature of how the Saudi bureaucracy works.\n\nThey got caught red-handed. They attempted to come up with a cover story. But the cover story doesn’t add up.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\n\n—it was carried out poorly, and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nThere are so many holes in in your story, the story that you put out there. Even the president in the United States said, \"This is the worst cover-up I've ever seen.”\n\nADEL AL-JUBEIR:\n\nWith all due respect, we put out the stories as we have it based on the facts that were established. We have never, in the history of Saudi Arabia, had a situation where a Saudi citizen was murdered. This is not how we operate, and this is not what our values are.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIs there anything about this young prince that worries you?\n\nPRINCE TURKI AL-FAISAL :\n\nYou know what my only worry is? I've reached an age where I don't know if I'll be around when the fruits of what is happening in Saudi Arabia will be picked. Because I see the kingdom moving in a very, very straight way towards the well-being of Saudis, and hopefully the well-being of the world.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nOn Nov. 16, the CIA concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the murder of Khashoggi. They refused to comment publicly about it. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did.\n\nMIKE POMPEO:\n\nI’ve read every piece of intelligence, unless it's come in the last few hours. There is no direct reporting connecting the crown prince to the order of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. And that’s all I can say in an unclassified setting.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nBut immediately after Pompeo’s comments, someone leaked a summary of the report to a \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Warren Strobel.\n\nYeah, I’ve got it right here.\n\nYou're the only reporter that I'm aware of that has seen that CIA report.\n\nWARREN STROBEL, \"The Wall Street Journal\":\n\nI believe I am the only reporter, even to this day, who has seen the CIA report.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWhy were you shown this report?\n\nWARREN STROBEL:\n\nI don't know to this day; I can only speculate. My analysis is that this person was upset that the intelligence was being portrayed differently by the president of the United States and the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\n\nThey do point out certain things, and in pointing out those things you can conclude that maybe he did or maybe he didn’t. But there's no—that was another part of the false reporting.\n\nWARREN STROBEL:\n\nPresident Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over and over have pointed to the fact that U.S. intelligence does not have evidence of a kill order. But they sort of stop there. And if you actually read the CIA assessment, as I have, everything else in that points a finger at the crown prince as having a role.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\n\nThe CIA has looked at it; they’ve studied it a lot; they have nothing definitive.\n\nWe are with Saudi Arabia. We're staying with Saudi Arabia. Have a good time everybody! Thank you.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe president here is positioning himself to be able to not take tougher measures against Saudi Arabia.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nTrump’s response is a slap in the face to the intelligence community—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd there was more. It was reported that on the day of the murder, Maher Mutreb made a call. He said, in effect, “Tell your boss the deed was done.”\n\nBRUCE RIEDEL:\n\nThe phone number that was being called in Riyadh was the crown prince's office. Doesn't get much better than that. If you call the White House Situation Room, I come to the conclusion the White House knows what's going on.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nLast December I talked to Prince Mohammed at the racetrack. He spoke about his role in the Khashoggi murder for the first time.\n\nMy camera was outside, but he said:\n\n“It happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility because it happened under my watch. I really take it very seriously. I don't want to tell you, no, I didn't do it, or I did do it, or whatever. That's just words.”\n\nI asked how it could happen without him knowing about it.\n\n“Accidents happen. Can you imagine? We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees. I am not Google or a supercomputer to watch over 3 million.”\n\nThey can take one of your planes? I asked.\n\n“I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they’re responsible. They have the authority to do that.”\n\nBut during it Qahtani is texting you, right? I asked.\n\n\"Yeah, he texts me every day.\"\n\nI was curious about those texts; they had been cited in the CIA report linking MBS to the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nMBS insisted they were innocent.\n\nLater I learned that the Saudis had hired a business intelligence firm, Kroll, to examine the texts. MBS wanted to share them with the CIA. I was allowed to look at Kroll’s report in Washington.\n\nThe texts don’t refer to Khashoggi or say anything about a kidnapping or a murder.\n\nBut then the NSA discovered they had had some damning evidence all along. They just didn’t realize it.\n\nMARK MAZZETTI:\n\nAfter Khashoggi's killed, the United States intelligence community starts looking backwards, scrubbing intercepts that they had picked up over years.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd they find MBS chatting with Qahtani back in 2017.\n\nMARK MAZZETTI:\n\nMohammed bin Salman is expressing frustration and annoyance about Khashoggi, saying he’s becoming more influential.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nQahtani cautioned Prince Mohammed that any move against Khashoggi was risky and could create an international uproar. MBS scolded Qahtani for being too cautious.\n\nAnd then—\n\nMARK MAZZETTI:\n\nThere’s a conversation between Mohammed bin Salman and another influential adviser, and Prince Mohammed says, \"If we can’t bring Jamal back by force, we should show him a bullet.\"\n\nFEMALE AIRPORT ANNOUNCER:\n\nThank you for waiting. Saudia flight service to Riyadh would like to continue boarding. Would all passengers sitting in the rows 2, 3, and 4—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nI returned to Saudi Arabia one last time in April 2019. The crown prince had promised to meet with me again. I came prepared with many more questions.\n\nWhen I arrived, he changed his mind. I was not able to ask any more questions about the Khashoggi murder.\n\nBut more evidence kept on coming. In June, Agnès Callamard, a United Nations human rights expert, issued the most detailed report to date on the Khashoggi killing.\n\nI saw her in London at a conference.\n\nAGNÈS CALLAMARD, UN Special Rapporteur:\n\n—killing of Mr. Khashoggi, 15 agents flew to Turkey, eight of them in a private jet which had diplomatic clearance; two of them had diplomatic passports. There is no other conclusion but that the killing of Mr. Khashoggi is a state killing. It should be seen to constitute an international crime for which universal jurisdiction attract.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nIn preparing her report, Callamard was granted access to the audio recordings of the hit team as they discussed their plans.\n\nAGNÈS CALLAMARD:\n\nI listened to the tapes within the premise of the Turkish intelligence.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAnd you heard a conversation. Tell us about that conversation.\n\nAGNÈS CALLAMARD:\n\nSo that conversation is within an hour before the killing. Mutreb is asking whether or not the trunk of the body will fit into a normal bag. Does it need a stronger bag? How do you disjoint a body? That, too, is being discussed. Tubaigy, the doctor, raises some issues regarding having to cut on the ground, because he's never done that. They are seemingly rehearsing, planning the act of killing an hour later.\n\nHATICE CENGIZ:\n\n—since the horrible murder of Jamal—\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nAt the London conference, Callamard joined Khashoggi’s fiancee and others, calling for her report to spur further action.\n\nHATICE CENGIZ:\n\nI would like to ask you all to use this report as a means to prevent an attempt to silence us or push the matter under the carpet.\n\nYAHYA AL-ASSIRI:\n\nThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi, it is not the first crime from the Saudi regime. So what we want from you is to pressure your politicians, your media to stand with the Saudi heroes behind the bars and to ask the justice for Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nKAREN ATTIAH:\n\nThis is about the freedom of people to say what they want, to tweet what they want, to blog what they want, to speak about what they want without fear that they will be executed for it.\n\nAGNÈS CALLAMARD:\n\nThe fact that the killing of Jamal Khashoggi is still making the news, that needs to continue, because that’s what is going to annoy the hell out of them and be the mosquito in the tent that they can’t ever get rid of.\n\nFEMALE MODERATOR:\n\nThank you very much, Agnès.\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nTo date, MBS has offered no apology for the killing of Khashoggi, and he still insists those responsible will be brought to justice for what he calls a “heinous crime.” In the meantime, he continues to pursue his Vision 2030.\n\nMALE DJ:\n\n—here we go: one, two, one two three four!\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nWith sporting events and big concerts, he is trying to win the hearts of young Saudis.\n\nCONCERT CROWD:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nLong live Salman!\n\nMARTIN SMITH:\n\nHis defenders say that the Khashoggi murder and his campaign against dissent should not outweigh everything else he has achieved.\n\nCONCERT CROWD:\n\n[Speaking Arabic]\n\nLong live Salman! Long live Salman!\n\nCurrently, at least nine members of the hit team that went to Istanbul are on trial. The courtroom is closed to the public and reporters.\n\nSalman al-Awdah remains in prison and is still facing possible execution.\n\nLoujain al-Hathloul is still being held. According to her family, authorities asked her to confess on video that she was not tortured. She refused.\n\nSaud al-Qahtani faces no charges. A high-level adviser to MBS told FRONTLINE that prosecuting someone so close to the crown prince would be politically disruptive."
