        "text": "The Royal Family\n\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein assumed his constitutional powers as King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on February 7th, 1999, the day his father, the late King Hussein, passed away.\n\nHis Majesty King Hussein bin Talal, the father of modern Jordan, will always be remembered as a leader who guided his country through strife and turmoil to become an oasis of peace, stability, and moderation in the Middle East. Among Jordanians, his memory is cherished as the inspiration for Jordan's climate of openness, tolerance, and compassion. Known to his people as Al-Malik Al-Insan (\"The Humane King\"), King Hussein was the forty-second generation direct descendant of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him (PBUH).\n\nBorn in Amman on November 14, 1935, to Prince Talal bin Abdullah and Princess Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil, King Hussein attended Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and Harrow School in England. He later received his military education at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England.\n\nHussein was proclaimed King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on August 11, 1952. A Regency Council was appointed until King Hussein’s formal accession to the throne on May 2, 1953, when he assumed his constitutional powers after reaching the age of eighteen, according to the Islamic calendar.\n\nThroughout his long and eventful reign, King Hussein worked hard at building his country and raising the living standard of every Jordanian. Early on, King Hussein concentrated on building an economic and industrial infrastructure that would complement and enhance the advances he wanted to achieve in the quality of life of his people. During the 1960s, Jordan’s main industries - including phosphate, potash, and cement - were developed, and a network of highways was built throughout the kingdom."
