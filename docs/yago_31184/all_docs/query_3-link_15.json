        "text": "Crown prince\n\nMohammed was appointed crown prince in June 2017 and wasted no time pursuing his audacious goals. Just days later he spearheaded a multicountry blockade against Qatar, not only for its friendly stance toward Iran but also for its support for rival non-state actors in the region, such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Though the three-year blockade led to a crisis for Qatar in the short-term, the country used its wealth to reorient its economy away from reliance on its fellow Gulf countries.\n\nAt times his assertiveness abroad backfired and led to international backlash. In November 2017 Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri resigned suddenly under suspicious circumstances while on a visit to Riyadh. Only after significant international pressure was Hariri allowed to return to Lebanon, where he immediately suspended his resignation. The circumstances behind the bizarre episode remained unspoken, but the world’s suspicions were reflected by Mohammed at an investment conference a year later when he cracked a joke about kidnapping Hariri.\n\nAbout the same time as Hariri’s peculiar resignation, dozens of Saudi princes, business leaders, and senior officials were arrested. The maneuver was billed as an anti-corruption sweep. But because the detained individuals were some of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in the country—including mega-billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal—many observers suspected the true purpose of the sweep was to secure power in Mohammed’s hands. Many were released only after relinquishing partial control of their businesses to the state or paying billions of dollars. The Saudi government was believed to have collected more than $100 billion from the move.\n\nDespite the apparent shakedown, Mohammed had initially been hailed abroad as a reformer at home. Often to the chagrin of conservative Saudis and the Wahhābī religious establishment, his policies began to relax many of the strict social restrictions for which Saudi Arabia was known. In line with his effort to boost tourism in the kingdom, a ban on cinemas was reversed, and women were allowed to attend sporting events. In 2018 he loosened the public dress code slightly by stating that women do not need to wear an ʿabāyah, a long black cloak, in public. Later that year women were allowed to obtain driver’s licenses, enabling women to go to work or school or perform errands without accompaniment. Still, these steps toward liberalization appeared motivated by economic gain and not by a desire for freedom. While women were offered new choices that would allow them to earn and spend money without requiring their male guardians to provide constant consent and transportation, the government also cracked down on women activists who continued to press for more freedoms.\n\nIn October 2018 Mohammed orchestrated the extrajudicial killing abroad of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent journalist and exiled government critic who once served as an adviser and aide to a Saudi ambassador. On Mohammed’s orders, Saudi operatives lured Khashoggi into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where they tortured and dismembered him. Turkey’s Pres. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan led the outcry against the killing; committed on Turkish soil against a dissident living in exile, it raised international concerns over both state sovereignty and human rights. The fallout was contained, as the royal family continually deflected responsibility for the incident, but Mohammed’s image abroad had been tarnished.\n\nIn March 2020, as the world began grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, Mohammed once again detained fellow members of the Saudi royal family. Said to be under investigation for treason, the detainees included princes much closer to the throne, including Ahmad, King Salman’s brother, and Muhammad bin Nayef, the former crown prince whom Mohammed bin Salman had replaced.\n\nMeanwhile, the economic fallout from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine revitalized Mohammed’s stature as a global economic player in 2022. As high oil prices and inflation plagued the economy the world over, Erdoğan warmly received Mohammed in Turkey in June. And despite U.S. Pres. Joe Biden’s earlier resolve to sideline Mohammed in U.S.-Saudi relations, Biden met Mohammed face-to-face in July during a high-profile trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn September 2022 Mohammed was appointed prime minister, an office traditionally held by the king that oversees the Council of Ministers. His younger brother Khalid took his place as defense minister.\n\nHaving strengthened his de facto status as the premier policy maker of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed sought to foster more cordial and stable relations internationally. In October he reportedly indicated that he would normalize Saudi Arabia’s ties with Israel, as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and other Arab countries had done in recent years. But the offer was conditioned on the restoration of the United States’ commitments to the country’s security and to helping it develop a nuclear program for civilian purposes. The United States was unswayed, however, so Mohammed looked elsewhere. In March 2023, after days of talks in which China served as mediator, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached a deal to restore ties after years of competition between them had devastated the region. The deal suggested that an end was in sight for the civil war in Yemen, which, as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, had turned into a costly and harmful quagmire for Mohammed’s agenda. The diplomatic breakthrough also strengthened Saudi ties with China, a powerful alternative and counterweight to the United States that Mohammed could leverage in his dealings with the North American superpower. Indeed, just hours after the deal was announced, the offer to normalize ties with Israel in exchange for U.S. commitments on security and nuclear technology was reiterated."
