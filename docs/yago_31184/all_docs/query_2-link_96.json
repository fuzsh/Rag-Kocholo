        "text": "Jordan's Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah married Saudi architect Rajwa Al Saif in a wedding attended by royals from around the world on June 1. Massive crowds gathered across the kingdom to celebrate the region’s newest power couple\n\nThe wedding took place in Amman's mid-century Zahran Palace, which has hosted numerous major Hashemite kingdom weddings, including those of King Abdullah II to Queen Rania and the late King Hussein bin Talal\n\nThe king's eldest son and Al Saif, both 28, married in front of their families and 140 guests, including US First Lady Jill Biden and Britain's Prince and Princess of Wales, who made a surprise appearance. Other important guests who attended the wedding include the Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima, as well as Belgium's King Philippe and Crown Princess Elisabeth and Danish Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary\n\nThe bride arrived at Zahran Palace in a white gown in a 1968 Rolls-Royce Phantom V custom-made for the crown prince's late great-grandmother. The crown prince arrived earlier dressed in full ceremonial military regalia and wielding a gold-hilted sabre\n\nThe young prince rose to prominence in recent years by accompanying his father, King Abdullah II, in public interactions. Hussein graduated from Georgetown University in the United States, entered the military, and garnered international acclaim by speaking at the United Nations General Assembly\n\nPrincess Rajwa was born in Riyadh. She is descended from the Al Sudayri dynasty of Najd in what is now modern-day Saudi Arabia, which is reputed to be intimately tied to the Saudi royal family"
