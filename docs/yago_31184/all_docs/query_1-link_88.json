The story had glamour, intrigue, great characters:\n\nThe Jerusalem-born princess, who attended a British boarding school and married one of King Talal of Jordan’s sons before her 20th birthday, is very beautiful. By the mid-’80s, a news story that needed to rattle off a group of chic names mentioned her in between Princess Caroline and Catherine Deneuve. “Opulent and classic, with a great sense of color,” is how Gotham’s best-dressed list put it this year. In her 60s, she resembles Annette Bening, except she’s not from Topeka.\n\nShe has dated very rich men, but not wimpy ones. “She was the first woman to operate in his league,” Vanity Fair wrote in a 1992 profile of the monolithic tycoon Stavros Niarchos. “He really cared for her.”\n\nAnd despite conjuring archetypal figures like wicked stepmothers and greedy princelings, the conflict was never as simple as either side made out. Even if the 7,000-square-foot apartment now appears to be Princess Firyal’s, it seems unlikely that either she or the Pincuses are totally finished wrangling."
