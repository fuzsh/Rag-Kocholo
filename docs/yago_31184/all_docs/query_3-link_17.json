        "text": "New Book on Prince Al Waleed\n\nAlwaleed : Businessman, Billionaire, Prince (Hardcover)\n\nby Riz Khan\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nThough Prince Alwaleed bin Talal came to public attention in the U.S. when Rudy Giuliani rejected his $10 million donation to the Twin Towers fund, Alwaleed's real significance is as a global financial powerbroker. The Saudi royal is the biggest single foreign investor in the U.S. economy and the world's fourth-richest man, with assets totaling more than $21 billion. His significant holdings in U.S. companies include Citigroup (which he bailed out with $590 million in the early '90s), Apple and News Corp., the corporate entity responsible for this \"authorized biography.\" Khan, who has interviewed high-profile figures for CNN International, tags along with Alwaleed and his entourage as they conduct business in Riyadh and Paris, holiday in Cannes and trek into the Saudi desert for a weekend getaway. The resulting reportage has the breezy flavor of a magazine profile awkwardly stretched to book length. There's plenty of praise for Alwaleed's \"financial intelligence\" and outsized personality, but Khan doesn't probe beyond the admirable surface (though he notes others have tried to dig up dirt with little success). The glowing descriptions seem carefully crafted—and timed—to raise Alwaleed's profile in the West.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006...0233429-0780700\n\nAttached Image\n\n( I didn't read the book until now , but the latest news he is single again , he no longer married to princess kholood ) , the prince in his book talked about his ex 3 wifes .\n\nby the way a dvd comes with the book , and his children was interviewed .\n\nLa la said:\n\nI was surprised (rather shocked) to learn about his divorce from Kholood. I hope he finds a woman who can cope with his hectic lifestyle. He could need someone to grow old with when both of his children get married and move out. I'm sure no money in the world can replace having people who genuinly care about you.\n\nI also shocked to learn about his divorce , I can't blame Kholood if she is the one who asked for the divorce because he don't want more children and he is really bussy man\n\nby the way his son already married , so maybe prince Reem marry soon and he will be alone in that big palpce .\n\nLa la said:\n\nI was surprised (rather shocked) to learn about his divorce from Kholood. I hope he finds a woman who can cope with his hectic lifestyle. He could need someone to grow old with when both of his children get married and move out. I'm sure no money in the world can replace having people who genuinly care about you.\n\nNow Khollod must be a very sad woman, she has given five years theirs youth, none has agreed children and simply had to go. I find this is a great pity. However, it also is Alwaleed because none woman so much energie has to remain around with him. He also determined nobody especially happy man.\n\nhouri said:\n\nKhaled wife is the daughter of the former minister fiscal of saudi arabia , some one in other forum did read the book and said that the prince wished his children to not married from the royal house .\n\nso prince khaled didn't married to a princess so maybe princess Reem will not marry a prince .\n\nit is not a big deal for a an arab sheikh or prince to marry commoners - on the contrary, majority of them will marry from their mothers side (which is usually not royalty - thus marrying their cousins who are commoners).\n\nas for the girls marrying, they marry from the family so that the name is kept for their children. rarely, do you find a sheikha or princess marrying outsiders ( and when they do, it is to other royalty).\n\nShe teased him and in the book, it is pretty clear that she is teasing and not \"making fun\" of him. He enjoys a good sense of humor and does not talk poorly about this. His hectic lifestyle would be hard for any person. However, he states very clearly that he feels that the reason for the divorce is that he does not want any more children. Basically, that was the last straw for her. He states time and time again that Khalood was a \"very patient woman\". He talks about her patience on many levels. It would be hard to be a 27 year old female to sacrifice ever having a child of her own. I believe that she did the best that she could in a difficult situation.\n\nNo one can understand the happenings in a marriage as it is private and between only the two people involved.\n\nFranciscanFry said:\n\nShe teased him and in the book, it is pretty clear that she is teasing and not \"making fun\" of him.

Nevertheless, Kholood has known from the outset the Alwaleed no more children wants to have, why she has him then generally married? I believe Alwaleed no happy man is what women concerns, they look, nevertheless, certainly only after his money!\n\nsimona said:\n\nEven if a woman endures patiently everything, nevertheless, she does not come along amusingly about her husband, but one could mean she has not loved him at all! Nevertheless, Kholood has known from the outset the Alwaleed no more children wants to have, why she has him then generally married? I believe Alwaleed no happy man is what women concerns, they look, nevertheless, certainly only after his money!\n\nAlwaleed has been married (and divorced) three times. His other two wives were of royalty. The money would mean less than his title to other ladies of his stature. I am married to a saudi man. I assure you that a little teasing does not mean that anyone married for money. In islam, teasing, laughing and enjoying one another is thought to be a good part of a marriage. It would be easy to attack a young woman of 27 who is not available to defend herself. I have a great deal of respect for alwaleed. However, he is honest that his last marriage ended because of him. A man who takes responsibility for his wrong-doings is a good man. He was quite evasive originally regarding the children topic. When discussing his marriage, he said that once he told her that he never wanted to have more children, it was over. Had she wanted him for only money, she would have stayed and endured a childless life.\n\nCertainly Alwaleed is a good and honest person. It is only a pity that he no luck has with women, maybe he looks after the wrong ones. Nevertheless, it must have dripped him that he reports about this banter in his book. Nevertheless, Kholood knew to begin to her marriage he no more children wants, why has Kholood generally married him then or has remained so long with him?\n\nOf course it is also very sad for Kholood, such a thing should happen to no woman, I simply do not fancy her life after a this connection. Nevertheless, she is no woman from the royal family and will not simply have it certainly, if she still in Saudi Arabia lives. Hopefully she finds a man with them a family can found.\n\nDunya said:\n\nYes Khalid is married I read the book. You can find pictures of him at this site. And I think the pic nr. 12 is the one with his wife Kholood? Correct me if I am wrong.\n\nhttp://www.reportages-pictures.com/PEOPLE/R00303%20prince%20Alwaleed/\n\nAlthough I can't be sure because the picture is a side profile...pic no. 12 looks like it could be his sister.\n\nI've seen a pic of his former wife, Khalood, and it doesn't really look like her\n\nalwaleed has a strict rule about keeping his wives out of media photos. He says he does it out of Saudi tradition and respect..\n\nI don't know if someone posted this before. If you go to this site you can see an interesting video about alwaleed and the women working for him.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwaleed_bin_Talal\n\nYou see at the end of the page EXTERNAL LINKS. Then click on A Dutch State television broadcast about Saudi woman with extensive footage of the Prince (Language=Dutch) .\n\nIt is a dutch video but the interview is in english. I think at the end it was so funny to see Alwaleed go through the Quran trying to find a verse that women can work. The journalist asked him if he can recite something but he calls for all his people and it become a whole mission.\n\nsimona said:\n\nHi,\n\ni look for a picture from Kholood in the yahoo groups (family picture), it is not a god picture. I think Kholood is beautyfull women. what make Kholood after her divorce from Prince Alwaleed?\n\nYou mean what made Khalood divorce Prince Alwaleed?\n\nIf that is the question, they divorced because she wanted children and he did not. Alwaleed says that this was \"the straw that broke the camels back\". Once this issue came between him, that was it.\n\nHe describes her as being very patient and a good person. She also had a very difficult time dealing with his schedule. His schedule is really really crazy and hard for a \"normal\" person to handle. After reading his book, his schedule made me tired. I could not marry him either\n\nDunya said:\n\nNo I heard she is a singer or some kind of a celebrity. With all respect to the woman I don't think Alwaleed would marry that type of a woman. Well you would never know but from what I heard him say in interviews and his book it doesn't look like he would. And he doesn't go public with his wives.\n\nI think the information I got was not correct. If I read this two articles I think she is one of his employees Ms. Lameis Al-Mouhandis and Ms. Roaa Shar.\n\nAlwaleed Donates $1 Million to Kenya\n\nhttp://www.arabnews.com/?page=6&section=0&article=82240&d=15&m=5&y=2006\n\nPrince Walid’s female entourage causes consternation\n\nhttp://www.khaleejtimes.com/Display...ne/theworld_June229.xml&section=theworld&col=\n\nBut I hope someone would translate this article then we know who she is.\n\nhttp://www.libanmall.com/alwaleed80.htm\n\nAttachments\n\nalwaleed.jpg"
