        "text": "A CLEANER has been arrested over the theft of up to £1million of jewellery from the home of a princess.\n\nVirgilina Taba, 65, allegedly swiped diamond rings, bracelets, watches and earrings while working in the £6million London property of Jordan’s Princess Firyal.\n\nThe cleaner is suspected of giving them to her 37-year-old nephew, Henao Taba, who allegedly sold them through auction houses.\n\nHe was arrested after trying to sell a ring — one of only six in the world — through a dealer who became suspicious and alerted police.\n\nA source said the princess, 76, had been devastated by the thefts.\n\nThey added: “Many of the items were precious and sentimental to her and cannot be replaced. Police have discovered where a lot of it was sold but it is a logistical nightmare trying to get it back.”\n\nPrincess Firyal, a philanthropist and humanitarian, was married to Prince Muhammad bin Talal — younger brother of Jordan’s late King Hussain — from 1964 to 1978.\n\nThe couple had two sons, Prince Tala and Prince Ghazi.\n\nThe jewellery went missing from her home in Belgravia, central London.\n\nLuxury items, including Hermes bags, were also taken.\n\nColombia-born Tabard, of Fulham, West London, and her nephew were arrested on November 26 before being released under investigation."
