On Monday she visited the Young Women's Leadership School in the morning and that evening made an appearance at the Superfriends Champions of the Global Fund Reception, where she was joined by Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, France's First Lady and a Global Ambassador for the Protection of Mothers and Children against AIDS. (This summer, while hanging out with Carla and her husband, French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Rania tweeted that her hostess was \"gorgeous inside & out\".) Then, on Tuesday, the Twitter-happy queen chatted with Diane Sawyer. Among the topics broached were the unifying power of social media, the potential of peace for Israel and Palestine, and the Queen's 15-year-old son, who now bears the title \"Crown Prince Hussein\" after being officially named successor to his father, __King Abdullah II, earlier this year.__In Britain, Queen Elizabeth II's cousin Prince Michael of Kent and his siblings are auctioning off royal treasures estimated at more than $1.6 million. The lots, which include silver, jewelry, paintings, furniture, and tapestries, belonged to Prince Michael's parents, Prince George and Princess Marina. Highly anticipated is the sale of an oil portrait of the late Princess Louise, which was painted by her mother, the late Queen Victoria. The artwork is expected to raise between $17,000 and $25,000. Since the Queen ceased covering the rent for their five-bedroom Kensington Palace apartment, the Prince and his wife, Princess Michael of Kent, must outlay nearly $200,000 per year for the apartment. If things get really bad, perhaps Prince Michael's son, newlywed Lord Frederick \"Freddie\" Windsor, will be forced to auction off some of the more luxurious items from his nearly $40,000 wedding gift registry.\n\nWe think Maj's strapped-for-cash cousins should take a lesson from her eldest son, Prince Charles. The Prince of Wales has urged people to decrease auto emissions by driving less and walking or taking public transportation more often. Of course, the green prince has received a bit of flack over his recommendations—he owns two Jaguars, two Audis, a Range Rover, and an Aston Martin (the later is a 21st-birthday gift from his mum).\n\nFind today's Royal Watch a bit tame for your tastes? Might we suggest a titillating recap of the ongoing legal battle between Jordan's Princess Firyal, longtime companion of the now incapacitated venture capitalist Lionel Pincus, and Pincus's sons. Although, if you've been following Royal Watch the last few weeks, you know all the main developments of the drama anyway.\n\nHollywood\n\nTrump’s Politics Aside, Do We Want a President With Pop-Culture References This Old?\n\n“The late, great Hannibal Lecter. He’s a wonderful man.” “Nobody could moonwalk like Michael Jackson.” “You know how many times I did The View?” Now that Biden is out of the race, please consider that these are actual statements Donald Trump has recently made.\n\nStyle\n\nLady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Tom Cruise, and More A-Listers Pack the Stands at Paris Olympics for Return of Simone Biles\n\nStars poured into Bercy Arena on Saturday to watch the renowned American gymnast compete for the gold.\n\nPolitics\n\nCould Global Tensions Puncture the Olympic Bubble?\n\nThe Olympics are often viewed as a respite from politics, but multiple wars and rising global tensions will be hard to ignore this year. “I’m here to bring awareness,” says Valerie Tarazi, a swimmer representing Palestine at the 2024 Summer Games.\n\nCelebrity\n\nBlues Legend John Mayall Is Dead at 90\n\nA giant of the great British blues boom of the 1960s was a musical change-agent who revered and honored his forebears."
