        "text": "Jordan’s King Abdullah II is mourning the death of his uncle, Prince Muhammad bin Talal, who died on Thursday, 29 April at the age of 80.\n\nThe Royal Hashemite Court said the Prince, who was the King’s personal envoy, died in Amman.\n\nThe Royal Court said in a statement: ” ‘O soul at peace! Return to your Lord, pleased, pleasing. Then enter among My servants! And enter My Paradise!’\n\n“The Royal Hashemite Court mourns the passing of His Royal Highness Prince Muhammed bin Talal, His Majesty’s personal envoy, may his soul rest in peace. Prince Muhammed passed away on Thursday, 29 April 2021 (17 Ramadan 1442), in Amman.”\n\nKing Abdullah has ordered that the Royal Hashemite Court will enter into seven days of mourning.\n\nPrince Muhammad bin Talal was born on 2 October 1940 as the second son of King Talal of Jordan and Queen Zein. He was the younger brother of King Hussein – the father of King Abdullah.\n\nMuhammad – who was 14th in line to the throne before his death – was married twice and had two sons by his first wife: Prince Talal (b. 1965) and Prince Ghazi (b. 1966). He is survived by his widow Taghrid Majali, two sons and daughters-in-law and seven grandchildren.\n\nHe was educated in Jordan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Prince Muhammad was in the Jordan Arab Army and served as an Aide de Camp to his brother. Muhammed was the Crown Prince of Jordan from 1952 to 1962 and served as regent at times when the monarch was out of the country. He was replaced as heir to the throne upon the birth of Hussein’s son, Abdullah, in 1962.\n\nHe was trilingual speaking Arabic, English and French. The Prince headed Jordan’s supreme committee for tourism for a time and was an honorary general in Jordan’s Armed Forces."
