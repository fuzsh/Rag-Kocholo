Our History...

The first reported settlers on record dating back to the 1860’s, consisted of a Metis settlement located at Round Prairie on the east bank of the South Saskatchewan River. The next flux of settlers arrived in the late 1870’s when Chief Whitecap settled his band of Sioux on the then called Moose Woods Reservation, adjacent to the South Saskatchewan River.

In 1880 ranchers started to come westward settling along Brightwater Creek and Brightwater Lake. With the arrival of the rail line in 1889 (Grand Truck Rail Line) it brought another wave of settlers looking for homesteads, from these early beginnings the Rural Municipality of Dundurn was borne; the municipality was incorporated on December 13,1909.

The townsites of Shield and Thode were established and fell under the administration of the RM until they established village status in 1978; Blackstrap Mountain was built in 1970 as the Canada Winter Games site. Camp Dundurn Military Base dates back to 1928; initially it was designated as a “relief labour camp” until World War II when it became a first-class Military Camp.
