Snow Clearing

We ask that you please use caution and slow down when passing graders and snow blowers clearing snow, due to reduced visibility.

When clearing your driveway you are also asked to please not push any snow on the RM road surface as this causes problems with snow blockage and rough grooves in the road for vehicles travelling.

Controlled Burn

CONTROLLED BURN now has a new number: 1-866-404-4911

When phoning in you will speak with an operator where you will need to state the land location of the fire, your name, along with other information. This recording will repeat the information back to you to ensure mistakes are not made.
