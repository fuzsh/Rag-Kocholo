        "text": "Brief History\n\nThe Rural Municipality (RM) of Prairiedale contains six townships with approximately 138,240 acres including the Villages of Smiley and Major, along with the ghost towns of Dewar Lake & Superb. The RM was incorporated in 1910; the name of the municipality is a descriptive one chosen by the early settlers.\n\nMajor is approximately 267 kilometers (kms) west of Saskatoon on Highway 51. The name comes from a series of titular names from a Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) list; the military theme is carried out in the names of the Village streets: Trooper Street, Recruit Street, and Sergeant Avenue. People from Ontario and the United States (U.S.) first settled the area in the 1880s. Major has a service station, camp sites, a credit union, and post office. The RM office is now located here in town, in the old school.\n\nSmiley was named for Ernest Everett Smiley. Born in Missouri, he filed on a homestead in the Smiley area in 1906. Today Smiley has a picnic/park/play area, and post office.\n\nOld Prairie Towns"
