        "text": "Saskatchewan's The Municipalities Act, The Cities Act and The Northern Municipalities Act, 2010 provide the basic legislative framework for all of the province's municipalities, and give municipalities what is referred to as \"Natural Persons Powers.\" This term is commonly understood to mean that municipalities possess all the same powers that a normal person would. Natural person powers generally do not give municipalities more jurisdiction than they already have; and they do not confer or expand any law-making, bylaw or taxing powers since natural persons don't have any such authority. What does change is the 'default' authority and flexibility for municipalities regarding administrative or corporate matters. Essentially, a municipality can take any action that a natural person or business could to carry out its purposes unless or until legislation prohibits an action or places limitations or conditions on an action.\n\nThe three Acts also describe the general purpose of municipalities. Section 4(2) of these Acts specify that municipalities have the following purposes:\n\nTo provide good government;\n\nTo provide services, facilities and other things that, in the opinion of council, are necessary or desirable for all or a part of the municipality;\n\nTo develop and maintain a safe and viable community;\n\nTo foster economic, social and environmental well-being; and\n\nTo provide wise stewardship of public assets.\n\nSaskatchewan cities operate pursuant to The Cities Act. Municipalities within the boundaries of the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District operate pursuant to The Northern Municipalities Act, 2010. All other municipalities operate pursuant to The Municipalities Act.\n\nAs the environment in which municipalities operate becomes increasingly complex, it isn't simple to categorize all the things that municipalities do on a day-to-day basis to fulfil their purposes. Generally speaking, however, it is the municipal level of government that has the most direct impact on the daily life of citizens.\n\nSaskatchewan currently has 766 urban, rural and northern municipalities. For listings, see the Municipal Directory.\n\nIn southern Saskatchewan there are 741 incorporated municipalities:\n\n445 are urban municipalities. These include:\n\n16 cities;\n\n147 towns;\n\n239 villages; and\n\n43 resort villages.\n\n296 are rural municipalities.\n\nCurrently there are no municipal districts in the province.\n\nIn northern Saskatchewan, there are 25 incorporated municipalities:\n\n2 northern towns;\n\n11 northern villages;\n\n11 northern hamlets; and\n\nThe Northern Saskatchewan Administration District (NSAD).\n\nUnincorporated areas of southern Saskatchewan include hamlets and organized hamlets. There are 142 organized hamlets established by Minister's Order.\n\nUnincorporated areas of northern Saskatchewan are part of the NSAD and are administered by the Northern Municipal Services Branch. There are 11 northern settlements within the NSAD.\n\nMaps\n\nFor a city, urban or rural municipality map, please contact the municipality directly.\n\nFor a rural municipal grid road map, contact the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities.\n\nFor a Saskatchewan rural municipality boundary map, contact Information Services Corporation (ISC).\n\nA rural municipality is created by a ministerial order that describes the municipal boundaries and divisions therein.\n\nA rural municipality is a defined territory incorporated under The Municipalities Act. These municipalities may include hamlets which may or may not be organized (see below). A rural municipality is governed by an elected council and has staff to manage daily administration and maintain municipal services (e.g., roads, utilities, recreation facilities).\n\nA rural municipal council has the power to adopt bylaws to:\n\nProvide for the health and safety of the municipality's residents;\n\nDecide what type and level of municipal services will be provided;\n\nControl land development and zoning provisions;\n\nBorrow money for municipal improvements; and\n\nSet local tax policies and rates to cover the costs of municipal services.\n\nOrganized Hamlets\n\nAn organized hamlet is an area within a rural municipality. It is created by a ministerial order and is governed by the rural municipality in which it is located. An organized hamlet is not incorporated and does not have legal authority.\n\nVoters of an organized hamlet elect a three-member advisory board that reports to the rural municipal council. Some organized hamlets may be designated as a division and be represented by a division councillor on the rural municipal council.\n\nNOTE: If you are looking for a rural municipal map, you will need to contact the rural municipality directly. Email addresses and telephone numbers of all Saskatchewan municipalities can be found using the Municipal Directory.\n\nA northern municipality is a northern town, northern village or northern hamlet incorporated under The Northern Municipalities Act, 2010. These municipalities are located in the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District. A northern municipality is created by a ministerial order that describes the municipal boundaries. Each is governed by an elected council and has staff to manage daily administration and maintain municipal services (e.g. roads, utilities, recreation facilities).\n\nNorthern settlements are created under the same legislation; but each is governed by elected local advisory committee that reports to the Minister of Government Relations to provide for the health and safety of the municipality's residents to:\n\nDecide what type and level of municipal services will be provided;\n\nControl land development and zoning provisions;\n\nBorrow money for municipal improvements; and\n\nSet local tax policies and rates to cover the costs of municipal services.\n\nNorthern municipalities and settlements can be contacted using the Municipal Directory.\n\nTo view or buy a copy of The Northern Municipalities Act, 2010 or its related regulations, visit the Publications Centre.\n\nGuides, manuals and calendars for administrators and clerks can be found on the Municipal Administration page."
