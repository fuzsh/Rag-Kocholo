        "text": "Canada Gazette, Part I, Volume 156, Number 21: Supplement\n\nMay 21, 2022\n\nFEDERAL ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES COMMISSION FOR THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nProposal of the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for the Province of Saskatchewan\n\nOverview\n\nThe Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for the Province of Saskatchewan (the Commission) has been established pursuant to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-3 (the Act). The Commission is an independent, three-member body responsible for defining the sizes, boundaries, and names of the federal electoral districts within the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nSaskatchewan’s representation in the House of Commons is 14 members, which means that the Province must be divided into 14 electoral districts. The 2021 Census, as determined by Statistics Canada, provides the basis for the redistribution of electoral districts under the Act. Between the 2011 and 2021 censuses, based on the data made available to the Commission at the time of drafting this Proposal, Saskatchewan’s population count increased from 1,033,381 to 1,132,505footnote 1. This is an increase of 99,124, which must be accommodated within Saskatchewan’s 14 electoral districts. The population of the Province, divided by 14, gives an electoral quota for each electoral district of 80,893.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Commission proposes that the population of the Province of Saskatchewan be divided between the 14 electoral districts as illustrated by the maps set out in this Proposal. As will be demonstrated, apart from the electoral district of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, only one district departs from the electoral quota by more than 10%.\n\nIn brief terms, the Commission is suggesting at this time that some change may be needed to accommodate the large geographical areas with less population in the province. In particular, the extraordinary circumstances of the Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River electoral district may justify a significant variation from the electoral quota. In addition, the electoral districts of Yorkton—Melville and Souris—Moose Mountain are not made as large as strict adherence to the electoral quota might demand.\n\nBy way of further recognition of the large geographical areas covered by Cypress Hills—Grasslands and, to some extent, Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan, the Committee is proposing a possible reconfiguration of both of these electoral districts to establish two electoral districts running east and west rather than north and south. These districts would be named Kindersley—Rosetown and Moose Jaw—Swift Current—Grasslands.\n\nThe Commission is also proposing a reconfiguration of the Saskatoon electoral districts. In response to submissions and in recognition of the significant growth in that city, the Commission is proposing (a) a reconfigured Saskatoon electoral district that includes the communities of Warman, Martensville and Humboldt in an electoral district to be known as Saskatoon—Wanuskewin; (b) a core urban electoral district to be known as Saskatoon Centre; and (c) an adjustment of the Grasswood suburban electoral district to include some neighbourhoods that are presently in the Saskatoon West electoral district.\n\nAs with all of the proposed changes within this document, the Commission seeks the public’s input. After holding public hearings and receiving written and oral submissions with respect to the Proposal, the Commission will prepare a final report, which will be published in the fall of 2022. The Commission stresses the importance of public participation during this process.\n\nA copy of the Proposal may be obtained from the Commission free of charge on request. Requests may be submitted to the Commission by mail or email. Contact information is provided in the Notice of Representation section.\n\nThe maps at the end of the Proposal show the boundaries of the proposed electoral districts. The following table shows the 14 districts, the population in each district, the percentage by which the population departs from the electoral quota in each district, the percentage by which the population departs from the electoral quota in each district if the population of the northern electoral district is excluded from the calculation, and finally the land area of each of the electoral districts.\n\nTable 1 2022 Proposed Federal Electoral Districts Population\n\nVariation from Electoral Quota\n\n80,893\n\nVariation from Reference Quota (excluding population of northern district)\n\n83,613\n\nArea (km2) Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River 45,524 −43.72% −45.55% 313,246 Battlefords—Lloydminster 83,815 3.62% 0.25% 37,542 Prince Albert 85,344 5.50% 2.07% 26,263 Saskatoon—Wanuskewin 83,562 3.29% −0.07% 19,301 Saskatoon Centre 89,092 10.09% 6.51% 43 Saskatoon—University 85,188 5.31% 1.88% 83 Saskatoon—Grasswood 80,704 −0.19% −3.44% 494 Kindersley—Rosetown 78,525 −2.93% −6.09% 61,099 Regina—Qu’Appelle 85,914 6.20% 2.75% 6,236 Regina—Lewvan 84,347 4.26% 0.87% 83 Regina—Wascana 85,642 5.90% 2.46% 53 Yorkton—Melville 78,865 −2.50% −5.68% 56,148 Moose Jaw—Swift Current—Grasslands 85,464 5.66% 2.22% 58,356 Souris—Moose Mountain 80,519 −0.46% −3.70% 53,098 Total 1,132,505\n\nReasons\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe population of Saskatchewan as determined by the 2021 Census was 1,132,505. This represents an increase of 9.6% over the 2011 Census population of 1,033,381. The two major cities (Regina and Saskatoon) grew at a substantially faster rate than the province as a whole. The 2021 population of the City of Regina was 226,404, or 17.2% greater than the city’s 2011 population of 193,100. The 2021 population of the City of Saskatoon was 266,141, or 19.8% greater than the City’s 2011 population of 222,189. The population of Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek also increased significantly from 72,607 to 83,395, representing a 14.86% increase from the 2011 Census.\n\nThe census change in population from 2011 to 2021 is captured by the following table, which was developed in relation to the electoral districts presently in place:\n\nTable 2 Current Federal Electoral Districts Population 2011 2011 Variation from Quota (%) (Provincial quota 73,813) Population 2021 2021 Variation from Quota (%) (Provincial quota 80,893) 2021 Population Variation (2011–2021) 2021 Population Variation (%) (2011–2021) Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River 69,471 −5.88% 71,488 −11.63% 2,017 2.90% Battlefords—Lloydminster 70,034 −5.12% 70,918 −12.33% 884 1.26% Prince Albert 79,344 7.49% 80,845 −0.06% 1,501 1.89% Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek 72,607 −1.63% 83,395 3.09% 10,788 14.86% Saskatoon West 76,704 3.92% 87,855 8.61% 11,151 14.54% Saskatoon—University 76,257 3.31% 88,348 9.22% 12,091 15.86% Saskatoon—Grasswood 72,010 −2.44% 93,277 15.31% 21,267 29.53% Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan 76,106 3.11% 80,547 −0.43% 4,441 5.84% Regina—Qu’Appelle 72,891 −1.25% 78,140 −3.40% 5,249 7.20% Regina—Lewvan 79,587 7.82% 98,492 21.76% 18,905 23.75% Regina—Wascana 77,208 4.60% 89,087 10.13% 11,879 15.39% Yorkton—Melville 71,270 −3.45% 71,220 −11.96% −50 −0.07% Cypress Hills—\n\nGrasslands 67,834 −8.10% 68,314 −15.55% 480 0.71% Souris—Moose Mountain 72,058 −2.38% 70,579 −12.75% −1,479 −2.05% Total 1,033,381 1,132,505\n\nGuiding Principles\n\nThe principles set forth in the Act govern the readjustment of federal electoral boundaries. Paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Act provides that the division of the Province into electoral districts and the description of the boundaries “shall proceed on the basis that the population of each electoral district […] shall, as close as reasonably possible, correspond to the electoral quota for the province”. This principle is often referred to as population parity, and its rationale rests in the democratic principle of one person, one vote.\n\nWith population parity at the forefront, subsection 15(2) of the Act goes on to provide that, within a province, a commission may depart from the rule contained in paragraph 15(1)(a) in any case where the commission considers it necessary or desirable to depart therefrom:\n\n(a) “in order to respect the community of interest or community of identity in or the historical pattern of an electoral district in the province,” and\n\n(b) “in order to maintain a manageable geographic size for districts in sparsely populated, rural or northern regions of the province.”\n\nIn departing from the application of the rule contained in paragraph 15(1)(a), the commission “shall make every effort to ensure that except in circumstances viewed by the commission as extraordinary,” the population of each electoral district “remains within twenty-five per cent more or twenty-five per cent less of the electoral quota.”\n\nEvery commission is also guided by the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Reference Provincial Electoral Boundaries (Sask), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 158, where the Court found that the right to vote enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the right to effective representation. The majority of the court noted that, while a citizen’s vote should not be unduly diluted, absolute parity is impossible and relative parity may detract from the goal of effective representation. McLachlin J. (as she then was) stated as follows:\n\n[55] It emerges therefore that deviations from absolute voter parity may be justified on the grounds of practical impossibility or the provision of more effective representation. Beyond this, dilution of one citizen’s vote as compared with another’s should not be countenanced. I adhere to the proposition asserted in Dixon, supra, [Dixon v B.C. (A.G.) (1986), 1986 CanLII 770 (BC SC)], at p. 414, that “only those deviations should be admitted which can be justified on the ground that they contribute to better government of the populace as a whole, given due weight to regional issues within the populace and geographic factors within the territory governed”.\n\nIn summary, the overarching principle of the Act is to ensure that each electoral district shall, as closely as reasonably possible, correspond to the electoral quota for the province. As will be shown in this Proposal, every effort has been made to respect the electoral quota. The Commission has also considered communities of interest and identity, historical patterns, and geographic size in proposing electoral boundaries.\n\nThe 2021 Census, as determined by Statistics Canada, provides the basis for the redistribution of electoral districts under the Act. Between the 2011 and 2021 censuses, Saskatchewan’s population count increased from 1,033,381 to 1,132,505. The electoral quota is determined by dividing the 2021 Saskatchewan census population count of 1,132,505 by 14 (the number of electoral districts) for an electoral quota of 80,893.\n\nIn contemplating how the Saskatchewan electoral quota can be viewed, it may be helpful to consider the provincial electoral and national quotas from the following chart, taken from data provided by Elections Canada:\n\n2021 Census Results and Provincial Quotas Province Seats Population Quota NL 7 510,550 72,936 PE 4 154,331 38,583 NS 11 969,383 88,126 NB 10 775,610 77,561 QC 77 8,501,833 110,413 ON 122 14,223,942 116,590 MB 14 1,342,153 95,868 SK 14 1,132,505 80,893 AB 37 4,262,635 115,206 BC 43 5,000,879 116,300 NT 1 40,232 40,232 NU 1 41,070 41,070 YK 1 36,858 36,858 Canada 342 36,991,981 108,163\n\nIn developing this Proposal, the Commission has strived to ensure that municipal boundaries would be respected wherever possible and that towns and small- to medium-sized cities would not be divided between two adjacent districts. It has also tried to place every First Nations reserve in its entirety within a single district. Where a number of First Nations reserves are geographically concentrated, the Commission has respected that fact by including them within the same electoral district. The public hearings will be important to ensure the Commission has met these goals.\n\nBroad Explanation of the Data\n\nOver the past decade, Saskatchewan’s fastest-growing electoral districts are the two exclusively urban electoral districts in Regina, the three electoral districts in Saskatoon, and the electoral district of Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek.\n\nThe 2021 Census confirms that the expanded population of the above six districts (the five exclusively urban ridings and Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek) averaged a population increase of 8.3%. By contrast, the remaining eight districts grew by 1.3% over the same period. To be clear, there was some population growth in all electoral districts except for Souris—Moose Mountain and Yorkton—Melville, but none of the electoral districts outside of Regina and Saskatoon kept pace with the growth of the six identified electoral districts.\n\nThe population increase requires some adjustment to Saskatchewan’s electoral districts in accordance with the governing principles.\n\nProposed Districts\n\nAfter the census data became available, the Commission sought input from the public on the data and its effect on Saskatchewan’s federal electoral boundaries. The Act does not contemplate this step, but other Commissions in and outside of the Province have found it useful to involve the public in the process as early as possible.\n\nThe Commission was pleased to receive 37 submissions, which have been very helpful in the development of this Proposal. The Commission is grateful to those who provided submissions at the early stages of this process and wishes to thank them for their participation in this important democratic exercise.\n\nIt should be noted that the Commission received a group submission, which supported a reconsideration of an issue that had been addressed by the Saskatchewan Commission in its 2012 Proposal and Report. The identified issue is whether Saskatchewan should have exclusively urban electoral districts in Saskatoon and Regina or whether it should have blended urban-rural districts in those cities. The Commission has included some aspects of this submission when proposing the electoral boundaries for Saskatoon.\n\nBased on its review of submissions, the data and past reports, the Commission proposes that the electoral boundaries be adjusted in a manner that strives to incorporate the principles set out in the legislation and Supreme Court of Canada case law.\n\nNorthern Electoral District of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River\n\nThe Commission determined that any examination of the electoral boundaries should begin with a consideration of the northern electoral district of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River. Using the geographic boundaries as they were set for the electoral districts in 2011, this northern electoral district had a landmass for electoral purposes of 342,684 square kilometres or 54% of the total landmass of the Province.\n\nHaving regard for the factor of geographic size alone, it appears that a substantial variation from the electoral quota is potentially justified. Past Saskatchewan commissions have identified this issue. The question is one of degree. With the provincial quota fixed at 80,893 and with no adjustment to the boundaries, this electoral district with a population of 71,488 requires the sitting representative to traverse not just a large landmass but to do so through territory with few roads.\n\nAnother factor setting Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River apart from the central and southern electoral districts is its cultural make-up. According to the 2011 census data, the cultural heritage of this area has a dominant Indigenous population. The First Nation, Métis and Dene peoples of this subarctic region share an historically distinct and contemporary northern, land-based way of life, with their own history, culture, spiritual and social values, languages and economies. The Woodland Cree, for example, specifically refer to the north as Kiwetinohk or place of the north wind.\n\nPrecedent for significantly reducing the size of the northern electoral district, and, thereby, departing from the electoral quota, may be found in other geographically large electoral districts in Canada. These are some of the largest with the least population and the greatest variance from the electoral quota:\n\nTable 3 Electoral district Population Area (km2) Variance Abitibi—\n\nBaie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou 85,475 854,754 −15.64% Kenora 55,977 321,741 −47.30% Labrador 26,728 294,330 −63.64%\n\nThe Electoral Boundaries Commission of Newfoundland and Labrador offered this explanation for the variation from the electoral quota in the Labrador electoral district in its 2012 Report:\n\nHaving considered the decennial census and the variances from the electoral quota, as summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 above, the Proposal initially addressed whether there were “extraordinary circumstances” as contemplated by section 15 of the Act that would warrant an electoral district whose population was outside the ± factor of 25 percent of the electoral quota.\n\nFor the past 25 years the Labrador portion of the Province constituted a separate electoral district even though its population was more than 25 percent below the electoral quota. The continuance of that electoral district would clearly have a significant effect upon the populations of other electoral districts. The Proposal addressed the matter as follows:\n\nThe 2011 decennial census found the population of the Labrador electoral district to be 26,728. That population is widely dispersed over an extensive land mass, which continues to pose serious transportation challenges for its residents and elected representatives. Residents of that electoral district, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, and whether residing in small coastal communities, in or near the major service centre in Upper Lake Melville or in the major natural resource development towns of Labrador West, are all known to assert the existence of a shared community of interest.\n\nHaving regard to its history, geography, community of interest and the strength of its distinct Aboriginal communities, the Commission views the circumstances of the Labrador portion of the Province as being extraordinary and as warranting the continuance of a separate electoral district.\n\nThe Commission next considered the remaining six electoral districts, recognizing that continuance of the Labrador electoral district would necessarily result in higher populations in some or all of these six electoral districts. To address that issue the Commission found it useful to calculate an electoral quota for those six districts as follows: 514,536 − 26,728 (Labrador) = 487,808 ÷ 6 = 81,301. Consideration of that quota (the reference quota) assisted the Commission in addressing the application of the statutory guidelines in section 15 of the Act to those electoral districts.\n\nWith these comments in mind, the Saskatchewan Commission observes that the large geographic size of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, coupled with its cultural and linguistic mix, could be viewed as extraordinary circumstances justifying a variation from the quota by −43.72%. Even with the proposed adjustment in the geographic size, Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River occupies 50% of the landmass of the Province and is 5.13 times larger than the second largest electoral district of Kindersley—Rosetown.\n\nReducing the size of the electoral boundaries of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River will have implications for the remaining electoral districts. It stands to reason that if some seats are to be below the electoral quota, others have to be above it. To accommodate this change, the population difference between 71,488 persons under an unadjusted boundary for Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River and 45,524 based on a revised boundary, which equals 25,964, must be absorbed in the remaining 13 districts. Following the approach in Newfoundland, it is useful to consider what can be called a reference quota, if no other adjustment is made, for those remaining districts of (1,132,505 – 45,524) ÷ 13 = 83,613 [reference quota] as well as the electoral quota when assessing the Proposal. To be clear, the electoral quota is the guiding principle.\n\nPrince Albert\n\nApart from adding subdivided and recreational lands that were formerly in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, this electoral district largely keeps the configuration it had following the 2011 Census. The total population of the Prince Albert electoral district according to this Proposal would be 85,344, which represents a 5.50% variation from the electoral quota and a 2.07% variation from the reference quota.\n\nBattlefords—Lloydminster\n\nApart from adding subdivided land and recreational lands that were formerly in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, this electoral district largely keeps the configuration it had following the 2011 Census. The total population of the Battlefords—Lloydminster electoral district, according to this proposal, would be 83,815, which represents a 3.62% variation from the electoral quota and a 0.25% variation from the reference quota.\n\nSaskatoon\n\nSaskatoon and the surrounding area have grown significantly. In 2012, it was possible to create three almost exclusively urban seats. The significant growth in the Saskatoon electoral districts makes that no longer completely possible even when considered in relation to the reference quota. The total population of the three electoral districts designed as they were in 2012 is 269,480. This figure divided by three equals 89,827.\n\nSeveral broad options confront the Commission. One is to absorb all of the existing population within the three electoral districts. This would make three of the largest electoral districts in the Province. Depending on where the boundary is placed for each electoral district, an electoral district of 89,827 would exceed the quota by 8,934.\n\nAnother option would be to create a blended urban-rural electoral district. This would include some of the urban population of Saskatoon and encompass the fast-growing communities on the outskirts of Saskatoon, including Warman and Martensville, as well as going east to include Humboldt, and the land and residences between these points.\n\nThe Commission is considering a combination of these approaches.\n\nIn relation to Saskatoon specifically, of the 37 emailed submissions received by the Commission to inform this Proposal, 17 concerned the Saskatoon electoral districts. Two of these submissions were co-authored or supported by 8 and 26 people, respectively. All 17 submissions support the creation of a central urban electoral district for Saskatoon, with adjustments of the other two existing urban electoral districts in Saskatoon to be made accordingly.\n\nThe Commission is considering readjusting the three existing electoral districts to allow for an electoral district to be called “Saskatoon Centre,” which would be bordered almost entirely by Circle Drive. The establishment of the Saskatoon Centre electoral district addresses communities of interest that are, to some extent, distinguishable from those of suburban and rural residents. These interests include (a) transportation infrastructure, (b) the development of the downtown core, (c) issues faced by at-risk populations, and (d) distinct issues faced by Indigenous people whose population in Saskatoon is concentrated in the neighbourhoods inside Circle Drive.\n\nThe population of the proposed Saskatoon Centre electoral district would be 89,092. This represents a variation of 10.09% from the electoral quota and 6.51% from the reference quota. Those who recommended the establishment of a core urban electoral district, and who also commented on the issue of quota size, understood that the population of this district would exceed 89,000. Apart from Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, this is the only riding for which the Commission is suggesting a departure of more than 10%. All of the other ridings are closer to the electoral quota.\n\nThe establishment of the Saskatoon Centre electoral district would involve including within it some neighbourhoods—those that are inside of Circle Drive—that are presently part of the Saskatoon West electoral district. The Commission is proposing that the remaining neighbourhoods in Saskatoon West situated outside of Circle Drive, become part of the enlarged Saskatoon—Grasswood electoral district as discussed below.\n\nThe Commission proposes to adjust the boundaries of the Saskatoon—University electoral district to accommodate the proposed Saskatoon Centre electoral district. The population of Saskatoon—University would be 85,188. This represents a 5.31% variation from the electoral quota and 1.88% from the reference quota.\n\nThe Commission proposes an adjustment of the boundaries of the Saskatoon—Grasswood electoral district in such a way as to establish it as a suburban electoral district. The proposed adjusted boundaries would include Saskatoon neighbourhoods to the south and east of Circle Drive. Those neighbourhoods to the east of Circle Drive are presently within the Saskatoon West electoral district. The population of the Grasswood electoral district with the proposed boundaries would be 80,704, which represents a variation from the electoral quota of -0.19% and from the reference quota of -3.44%.\n\nThe Commission proposes to realign part of what used to be Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek into a fourth Saskatoon and surrounding-area electoral district. The Commission is recommending that the new electoral district be called Saskatoon—Wanuskewin. It would include Saskatoon neighbourhoods that are outside and to the north of Circle Drive, and the surrounding area that includes other urban communities such as the fast-growing Warman, Martensville and Humboldt. The total population of Saskatoon—Wanuskewin according to this proposal would be 83,562, which represents a 3.29% variation from the electoral quota and a -0.07% variation from the reference quota.\n\nThe balance of Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek must be absorbed primarily within Kindersley—Rosetown, as reflected in the map provided with this Proposal.\n\nRegina\n\nLike Saskatoon, Regina has grown significantly, but not to the same degree. The total 2021 population of the three Regina electoral districts, including the blended urban-rural electoral district of Regina—Qu’Appelle, is 265,719, but the growth among the electoral districts is uneven. The total population as it stood according to the 2021 Census divided by three shows an electoral district size of 88,573, which would exceed the reference quota of 83,613 by 4,960 or 5.9%.\n\nUnlike Saskatoon, the Commission received relatively few submissions regarding how the 2021 population should be divided among Regina’s three electoral districts. In the absence of extensive submissions, the Commission considered two options.\n\nThe first option is to absorb the increased population within the existing electoral districts and make adjustments to account for the fact that Regina—Lewvan is the largest of the three electoral districts based on the 2021 Census data. This would mean moving the boundaries to account in some manner for the differences in those increases.\n\nThe second option is to decrease the geographical size of Regina—Qu’Appelle and establish three ridings of relatively equal size. The proposed map reflects the second option. It results in three ridings with the following deviations from the electoral quota as follows: (a) Regina—Lewvan at 84,347, which varies by 4.26%, (b) Regina—Qu’Appelle at 85,914, which varies by 6.2%, and (c) Regina—Wascana at 85,642, which varies by 5.9%.\n\nThis option has implications for both the Yorkton—Melville and Souris—Moose Mountain electoral districts.\n\nYorkton—Melville\n\nTwo main factors have influenced the proposed electoral boundaries of this district. The first is the reduction of the geographical size of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River. The second factor is the reduction in geographical size of Regina—Qu’Appelle. These two changes have increased the corresponding size of the electoral district of Yorkton—Melville, giving it a population of 78,865. The variation from the electoral quota for Yorkton—Melville based on the 2011 Census was -3.45%. The proposed increase in electoral size would reduce the variation from the electoral quota to -2.50%, with a variation from the reference quota of -5.68%.\n\nSouris—Moose Mountain\n\nThe reduction in geographical size of Regina—Qu’Appelle results in some increase in size of Souris—Moose Mountain. The large size of this electoral district justifies the Commission’s decision to continue to depart somewhat from the electoral quota for the district. The proposed population of Souris—Moose Mountain is 80,519. This represents a -0.46% variation from the electoral quota and a -3.70% variation from the reference quota.\n\nSwift Current—Moose Jaw—Grasslands and Kindersley—Rosetown\n\nThe Commission received a number of detailed submissions criticizing the configuration of Cypress Hills—Grasslands and Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan as not respecting the communities of interest in this part of the Province. In addition, most of the submissions expressed concern about the large size of Cypress Hills—Grasslands, which would in all likelihood have to increase to come closer to the electoral quota if no other adjustments were made. In that regard, it is noted that the landmass of Cypress Hills—Grasslands according to the 2012 Report was 77,831 km2. At least for the purposes of this Proposal, the Commission proposes that the two electoral districts should be substantially re-configured.\n\nThe Commission proposes one district following the transportation corridor running through Swift Current and Moose Jaw almost to the outskirts of Regina and to be named Moose Jaw—Swift Current—Cypress Hills. The population of this district would be 85,464, which represents a 5.66% variation from the electoral quota and a 2.22% variation from the reference quota.\n\nThe Commission proposes a second almost exclusively rural electoral district to recognize the community of interest that lies to the north of the South Saskatchewan River. It would absorb almost all that part of Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek that does not form part of Saskatoon—Wanuskewin. This district would be named after the two largest centres in the district and be called Kindersley—Rosetown. Conscious of the large geographic size of this district, the Commission did not extend its boundaries to the point of exact equivalence with the electoral quota. The population of Kindersley—Rosetown would be 78,525. This represents a -2.93% variation from the provincial quota and a -6.09% variation from the reference quota.\n\nNotice of Sittings\n\nHearing dates and places\n\nThe receipt of submissions and the holding of public sittings to hear representations by interested persons are an essential part of the electoral redistribution process. To that end, the Commission will be holding public sittings in respect of the proposed electoral districts. The Commission stresses the importance of these sittings or hearings to the process leading to the development of its final Report. For this purpose, the Commission will sit at the following centres and times: Location Place of hearing Date of hearing Time of hearing Saskatoon Sheraton Cavalier\n\n612 Spadina Crescent E Monday, June 20, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Saskatoon Sheraton Cavalier\n\n612 Spadina Crescent E Tuesday, June 21, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Prince Albert Best Western Premier\n\n313 38th Street W Wednesday, June 22, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. La Ronge Kikinahk Friendship Centre\n\n320 Boardman Street Friday, June 24, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Meadow Lake Flying Dust Community Centre\n\n1 Buffalo Rub Avenue & River Road Monday, June 27, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. North Battleford Don Ross Centre\n\n891 99th Street Tuesday, June 28, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Kindersley Royal Canadian Legion\n\n118 2nd Avenue E Wednesday, June 29, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Swift Current Coast Hotel\n\n905 North Service Road E Thursday, June 30, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Regina Holiday Inn and Suites\n\n1800 Prince of Wales Drive Tuesday, July 5, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Regina Holiday Inn and Suites\n\n1800 Prince of Wales Drive Wednesday, July 6, 2022 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Fort Qu’Appelle Treaty 4 Governance Centre\n\n740 Sioux Avenue S Thursday, July 7, 2022 10:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Moose Jaw Heritage Inn\n\n1590 Main Street N Friday, July 8, 2022 10:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Yorkton Ukrainian Cultural Centre\n\n240 Wellington Avenue Monday, July 11, 2022 10:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Weyburn Royal Canadian Legion 47\n\n150 3rd Avenue NE Tuesday, July 12, 2022 10:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Virtual hearing The link will be provided to participants Thursday, July 14, 2022 1:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m.\n\n6:00 p.m. – 8:30 p.m.\n\nOther sittings, including additional virtual hearings, can be scheduled depending on need.\n\nSimultaneous Translation\n\nEnglish-to-French and French-to-English translation will be available at any sitting of the Commission on written request to the Secretary of the Commission by:\n\n(a) any person who gives notice of intention to make a presentation at that particular sitting; or\n\n(b) any person who expresses an intention to attend that particular sitting.\n\nIn order to allow the Commission time to arrange for such language translation, the written request must be received by the Secretary of the Commission 14 days before the hearing that the person would like to attend. Contact information is provided in the Notice of Representation section.\n\nAccommodation Needs\n\nIf anyone wishing to attend or make a presentation at one of the Commission’s sittings has accommodation needs that would otherwise prevent the person from doing so, such person should notify the Commission in writing of the nature of those needs. In order to allow the Commission time to arrange for any special requirements, the written notice must be received by the Secretary of the Commission no later than 14 days before the hearing that the person would like to attend. Contact information is provided in the Notice of Representation section.\n\nNotice of Representation\n\nThe Act precludes the Commission from hearing any person desiring to make a representation at one of the Commission’s sittings, unless that person has given to the Commission the notice required by subsections 19(2) and 19(5) of the Act, which read as follows:\n\nNotice to be given by public advertisement\n\n19(2) Notice of the time and place fixed by the commission for any sittings to be held by it for the hearing of representations from interested persons shall be given by advertisement published in the Canada Gazette and in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the province at least 30 days before the day on which the sittings commence.\n\nNotice of representation to be given before sittings\n\n19(5) No representation shall be heard by a commission at any sittings held by it for the hearing of representations from interested persons unless notice in writing is given to the secretary of the commission within 23 days after the date of the publication of the last advertisement under subsection (2), stating the name and address of the person who seeks to make the representation and indicating concisely the nature of the representation and of the interest of the person.\n\nThe effect of these two provisions, taken in combination, is that notice in writing shall be given to the Secretary of the Commission within 23 days of the date of the publication of the last advertisement mentioned in subsection 19(2). Notwithstanding subsections 19(2) and (5) of the Act, subsection 19(6) provides that a “commission may hear the representation without the notice being given if the commission considers it to be in the public interest to do so.”\n\nWith the above principles in mind, the Commission should receive any notice to make a representation by June 13, 2022. Notice in writing shall be sent to the Secretary of the Commission, using the contact information below.\n\nBy email: sk@redecoupage-federal-redistribution.ca\n\nBy mail: Ms. Marlene Rodie\n\nCommission Secretary\n\nSaskatchewan Electoral Boundaries Commission\n\nP.O. Box 21031 Gardiner Park PO\n\nRegina, SK S4V 0Y0\n\nRules\n\nAs the Notice of Sittings section indicates, the Commission will be holding a number of public hearings. In accordance with section 18 of the Act, the Commission has developed rules for regulating its public hearings, as follows:\n\n1. These rules may be cited as “The Rules of the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for Saskatchewan, 2022.”\n\n2. In these Rules:\n\n(a) “Act” means the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-3;\n\n(b) “advertisement” means the advertisement published by the Commission pursuant to subsection 19(2) of the Act;\n\n(c) “Commission” means the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for the Province of Saskatchewan established following the 2021 decennial census;\n\n(d) “notice of intention to make a representation” means notice in writing given to the Secretary pursuant to subsection 19(5) of the Act;\n\n(e) “Secretary” means the Secretary of the Commission;\n\n(f) “sitting” means a sitting held for the hearing of representations in accordance with section 19 of the Act.\n\n3. These rules may be cited as “The Rules of the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for Saskatchewan, 2022.”\n\n4. A person giving notice of intention to make a representation shall state in the notice at which of the places, named in the advertisement as a place of sitting, that person wishes the representation to be heard. Such person may elect to make their submission in writing only, provided that such election is made in writing and delivered to the Secretary within the time limit for giving notice of intention to make a representation. The written submission must be delivered to the Secretary at the time of making such election or within 30 days thereafter.\n\n5. If a person giving notice of intention to make a representation fails to comply with the provisions of Rule 4, the Secretary shall forthwith ascertain from such person the place at which that person wishes to make the representation.\n\n6. If it appears to the Commission that no one will make a representation at any place designated by the advertisement as a place of sitting, the Commission, or the Chair of the Commission, may cancel the sitting at such place.\n\n7. Two members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the holding of a sitting to hear representations.\n\n8. If a quorum cannot be present at a place of sitting on the date set out in the advertisement, the Commission, or the Chair of the Commission, may postpone that sitting to a later date.\n\n(1) In the event of the cancellation of a sitting for reasons other than that set forth in Rule 7 or in the event of the postponement of a sitting, the Secretary shall forthwith notify any person who has given notice of intention to make a representation that the sitting has been cancelled or postponed. In such an event, the Secretary shall advise such person or persons at which other sitting the person may make her or his representation.\n\n(2) In the event of the cancellation or postponement of a sitting, the Commission, or the Chair of the Commission, shall give public notice of such postponement or cancellation by such means as the Commission, or the Chair of the Commission, considers adequate in the circumstances.\n\n9. If it appears at a sitting of the Commission that the Commission cannot complete hearing representations within the time allowed for the sitting, the Commission may adjourn the sitting to a later date at the same place or may, taking into account the convenience of persons whose representations have not been heard or have been only partly heard, adjourn the sitting to a sitting of the Commission elsewhere.\n\n10. As a general rule, representations will be limited to 15 minutes, including the time needed to set up and to take down any equipment that might be part of the presentation.\n\n11. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, a person who has given notice of intention to make a representation and who has indicated a desire to be heard at one of the places specified in the advertisement may, with the consent of the Commission, or the Chair of the Commission, be heard at any other sitting specified in the advertisement.\n\n12. At each sitting the Commission shall decide the order in which representations are heard.\n\n13. Having regard for issues surrounding the pandemic and the increased expectation from the public with regard to online services, the Commission will hold one or more virtual public hearings, depending on the utility and the demand. In addition to the principles to be applied to in-person public hearings, the following procedures and requirements apply to virtual public hearings:\n\n(a) the link to the virtual public hearing is made available only to participants and observers who have registered with the commission and to members of the media and is not to be shared;\n\n(b) a moderator will manage the agenda, the allotted speaking time and the microphones of the participants;\n\n(c) participants will have the option to share their screen;\n\n(d) the use of a headset by presenters is recommended;\n\n(e) presenters may choose to participate by phone;\n\n(f) simultaneous translation will be available, if requested.\n\nDated at Regina, Saskatchewan, 27th day of April, 2022.\n\nThe Honourable Madam Justice Georgina Jackson\n\nChair\n\nCourt of Appeal for Saskatchewan, Regina\n\nDr. Bonita Beatty\n\nDeschambault Lake\n\nAssociate professor in the Department of Indigenous Studies\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\n\nMark Carter\n\nSaskatoon\n\nProfessor in the College of Law\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\n\nAPPENDIX – Maps, Proposed Boundaries and Names of Electoral Districts\n\nThere shall be in the Province of Saskatchewan fourteen (14) electoral districts, named and described as set out below, each of which shall return one member.\n\nIn the following descriptions:\n\n(a) any reference to “arm,” “lake,” “drive,” “street,” “crescent,” “avenue,” “road,” “boulevard,” “line,” “highway,” “railway” and “river” signifies the centre line unless otherwise described;\n\n(b) sections, townships, ranges and meridians are in accordance with the Dominion Lands system of survey and include the extension thereof in accordance with that system.
