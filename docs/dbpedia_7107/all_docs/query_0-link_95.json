Saskatchewan’s representation in the House of Commons is 14 members and the province must be divided into 14 electoral districts. The population of the province divided by 14 gives an electoral quota for each electoral district of 73,813.\n\nThe Act directs that the division of the province into electoral districts shall proceed on the basis that the population of each electoral district shall, as closely as reasonably possible, correspond to the electoral quota of 73,813. The Commission is required to consider: (a) the community of interest or community of identity in or the historical pattern of an electoral district; and (b) a manageable geographic size for districts in sparsely populated, rural or northern regions of the province.\n\nThe Commission may depart from the rule which provides that the population of each electoral district shall, as closely as reasonably possible, correspond to the electoral quota. This may occur in any case where the Commission considers it necessary or desirable in order to respect the community of interest, community of identity or historical pattern of an electoral district or in order to maintain a manageable geographic size for electoral districts. In departing from the application of the rule, the Commission shall make every effort to ensure that, except in circumstances viewed by the Commission as being extraordinary, the population of each electoral district remains within 25% more or 25% less of the electoral quota.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Commission proposes that the Province of Saskatchewan be divided into 14 electoral districts as illustrated by the maps set out in this proposal and as described in this proposal.\n\nA copy of the proposal may be obtained from the Commission, free of charge, on request. Requests may be submitted to the Commission by mail, e-mail, telephone or fax. Contact information is provided in the Notice of Representation section.\n\nThe names which the Commission proposes for the 14 electoral districts, the population in each district, and the percentage by which the population departs from the electoral quota in each district are as follows:\n\nCypress Hills—Grasslands\n\nPopulation: 66,693 (9.65% less than the electoral quota)\n\nDesnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River\n\nPopulation: 69,486 (5.86% less than the electoral quota)\n\nKindersley—Rosetown—Humboldt\n\nPopulation: 74,829 (1.38% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nLloydminster—Battlefords—Rosthern\n\nPopulation: 74,653 (1.14% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nMoose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan\n\nPopulation: 71,006 (3.80% less than the electoral quota)\n\nPrince Albert\n\nPopulation: 76,854 (4.12% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nRegina—Lewvan\n\nPopulation: 76,395 (3.50% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nRegina—Qu’Appelle\n\nPopulation: 76,083 (3.08% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nSaskatoon Centre—University\n\nPopulation: 76,244 (3.29% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nSaskatoon—Grasswood\n\nPopulation: 74,738 (1.25% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nSaskatoon West\n\nPopulation: 73,858 (0.06% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nSouris—Moose Mountain\n\nPopulation: 71,089 (3.69% less than the electoral quota)\n\nWascana\n\nPopulation: 77,208 (4.60% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nYorkton—Melville\n\nPopulation: 74,245 (0.59% greater than the electoral quota)\n\nPart Ⅱ — Reasons\n\nThe population of Saskatchewan as determined by the 2011 Census was 1,033,381. This represented an increase of 5.56% over the 2001 population of 978,933. For their part, the two major cities (Regina and Saskatoon) grew at a substantially faster rate than the province as a whole. The 2011 population of the City of Regina was 193,100, or 8.34% greater than the city’s 2001 population. The 2011 population of the City of Saskatoon was 222,189, or 12.89% greater than the city’s 2001 population.\n\nStatistics Canada data for the 2001–2011 decade demonstrate that the shift in the population of the two principal cities rested on three facts: (1) continued intra-provincial migration from farms, villages and towns to the cities; (2) a net gain for the cities of interprovincial migrants; and (3) increased numbers of international migrants settling disproportionately in the two cities.\n\nThe obverse of these findings is that areas outside the two major cities attracted relatively fewer out-of-province and international migrants, and in general recorded slower levels of growth. In some regions of the province the population declined in absolute numbers, although the Commission noted that the rate of out-migration from farms, villages and towns to cities appeared to have been lower than in recent decades.\n\nSaskatchewan’s four fastest growing electoral districts over the past decade are of the “mixed urban-rural” variety. These are districts (used infrequently outside Saskatchewan) in which the majority of the population resides in a quadrant of one of the province’s two major cities and the minority in an adjoining, often geographically large aggregation of towns, villages and farms. The 2011 Census confirmed that the expanded population of four of these districts (Blackstrap, Saskatoon—Humboldt, Saskatoon—Wanuskewin and Wascana) had resulted in large measure from the increase in the urban component of the mixed districts. Between 2001 and 2011 these four districts averaged a population increase of 15.22%. By contrast the remaining 10 districts grew by 1.5% over the same period.\n\nThe population shifts of the past decade called into question the continued suitability of the composite urban-rural electoral districts. This issue is central to the Commission’s proposal for the province’s 14 electoral districts. It was also central to the concerns expressed by a considerable number of Saskatchewanians who contacted the Commission with communications ranging from brief, one-sentence or one-paragraph notes to formal documents presented on behalf of a group or association. These communications almost unanimously voiced opposition to the continued use of hybrid urban-rural districts in Saskatchewan. The Commission is grateful to those who contacted it at the outset of this redistribution process and wishes to thank them for their participation in this important democratic exercise.\n\nThe Commission’s proposal for the province’s districts reconfigures the electoral boundaries in a manner that incorporates the basic principles set out in the legislation: voter equity, community of interest and manageable geographic size. To that end the proposal calls for the establishment of two exclusively urban districts in Regina and three in Saskatoon. One of the 14 districts would be mixed urban-rural (Regina—Qu’Appelle), and one would contain an entire city whose population is greater than that of the district’s rural component (Prince Albert). The remaining seven would be primarily rural, although of those seven, six would each contain at least one small- to medium-sized urban centre (Lloydminster—Battlefords—Rosthern, Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Prince Albert, Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan, Souris—Moose Mountain and Yorkton—Melville).\n\nThe Commission is mindful of the fact that in creating five strictly urban districts, the majority of the rural districts would be set to increase in geographic size. To mitigate the impact of Regina’s and Saskatoon’s growth on the geographic size of rural districts, and to guard against the excessively large districts that would result if the electoral quota were strictly applied to all 14 districts, four of the districts (Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan and Souris—Moose Mountain) have had their populations kept below the quota of 73,813. Three other districts (Lloydminster—Battlefords—Rosthern, Kindersley—Rosetown—Humboldt and Yorkton—Melville) are marginally above the quota. Two districts with predominantly urban populations (Prince Albert and Regina—Qu’Appelle) and the five exclusively urban districts are, on average, 2.84% above the quota.\n\nThe Commission has attempted to ensure that municipal boundaries have been respected wherever possible and that towns and small- to medium-sized cities have not been divided with different portions assigned to each of two adjacent districts. It has also endeavoured to ensure that every First Nations reserve has been placed in its entirety within a single district. Where a number of First Nations reserves are geographically concentrated in the province, the Commission has respected that fact by including them within the same electoral district.\n\nThe proposal represents a significant change in Saskatchewan’s federal electoral map. To accomplish the goal of strictly urban seats, the Commission broke with a five-decade tradition in Saskatchewan. Introduced first in the 1966 redistribution, mixed urban-rural districts had become a standard feature of the federal electoral boundary readjustments.\n\nThe proposal returns to an earlier period (1933–1966) when both Regina and Saskatoon were designed as single electoral districts within the boundaries of the two cities. The major difference between that period and the present one is that, with a significantly greater share of the province’s total population now residing in the two principal cities, the number of entirely urban districts has reached an historic high.\n\nPart Ⅲ — Notice of Sittings\n\nThe Commission is required by the Act to hold sittings to hear representations by interested persons in respect of the proposed electoral districts. For this purpose, the Commission will sit at the following places and times:\n\n(1) Regina, Ramada Hotel and Convention Centre, 1818 Victoria Avenue, Monday, September 17, 2012, 10:00 a.m.\n\n(2) Swift Current, Credit Union iPlex, 2001 Chaplin Street East, Tuesday, September 18, 2012, 10:00 a.m.\n\n(3) Weyburn, Royal Canadian Legion, 150 3rd Street Northeast, Wednesday, September 19, 2012, 10:00 a.m.\n\n(4) Fort Qu’Appelle, Treaty Four Governance Centre, 740 Sioux Avenue South, Thursday, September 20, 2012, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\n(5) North Battleford, Don Ross Centre, 891 99th Street, Tuesday, October 2, 2012,10:00 a.m.\n\n(6) Prince Albert, Carlton Comprehensive High School, 665 28th Street East, Wednesday, October 3, 2012, 10:00 a.m.\n\n(7) Tisdale, RECplex, 800 101st Street, Thursday, October 4, 2012,10:00 a.m.\n\n(8) Saskatoon, Radisson Hotel, 405 20th Street East, Friday, October 5, 2012,10:00 a.m.\n\nSimultaneous Translation\n\nSimultaneous English-to-French and French-to-English language translation will be available at any sitting of the Commission on written request to the Secretary of the Commission by:\n\n(a) any person who gives notice of intention to make a representation at that particular sitting; or\n\n(b) any person who expresses an intention to attend that particular sitting.\n\nIn order to allow the Commission time to arrange for such simultaneous language translation, the written request must be received by the Secretary of the Commission no later than September 3, 2012. Contact information is provided in the Notice of Representation section.\n\nAccommodation Needs\n\nIf anyone wishing to attend or make a presentation at one of the Commission’s sittings has accommodation needs which would otherwise prevent that person from doing so, such person should notify the Commission in writing of the nature of those needs. In order to allow the Commission time to arrange for any special requirements, the written notice must be received by the Secretary of the Commission no later than September 3, 2012.
