        "text": "iHunter Saskatchewan offers county landowner maps for sale within the app.\n\nTo use these layers on your map, first make sure you have iHunter SK:\n\nThen add individual maps for between $14.99 and $21.99 depending on the county.*\n\nSelect your RM\n\nSaskatchewan is split up into nearly 300 rural municipalities, which each produce their own RM landowner maps to show who owns which parcels of land. Over 90% of the counties have been integrated and we are continuously working on getting more. Open the Map Layers panel in the bottom left corner of the map, and scroll to the Landowner Maps section. Tap on the map you are interested in to view more details.\n\nConfirm boundaries and purchase\n\nTurn on the switch for Show Boundary and then tap Zoom to boundary to make sure that the boundary of the RM landowner map is one that you are interested in. You can also tap within the bounds of a county and the boundary will be shown on the map (blue, dashed line).\n\nLandowner maps are sold on an RM by RM basis (not by WMZ) and purchases work just like a paper map – you get the version you purchased for as long as you want to use it. Once a new landowner map is available, you can purchase that to get the latest information.\n\nAvailable maps\n\nRM of Aberdeen No. 373 (2023)\n\nRM of Abernethy No. 186 (2022)\n\nRM of Antelope Park
