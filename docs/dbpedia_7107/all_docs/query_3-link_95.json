        "meta_description": "The old train station in Froude, SK. Photo courtesy of Chris AtrellSpanning from the Manitoba border to Alberta, Highway 13 runs along the rolling plains and badlands of southern Saskatchewan. Starting as the dirt path used by the Northwest Mounted Police during the march west, it soon became home to towns and villages that sprang up in anticipation of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Now, it is a key road that is a key access point to the life of many communities.Not all of those communities are still around. Towns like Amulet are commemorated by just a signpost and commemorative plaque. Others, like Froude, have a few residents, but by and large are comprised of crumbling buildings and forgotten roads. A few faced similarly tough times, like Ogema, but they managed to defy the odds to become integral parts of the province. No matter the fate of those towns, their memories contain lessons for the present and the future. The provincial motto is “From many peoples, strength”, and that was just as important in the early years of the 20th century as it is at the beginning of the 21st. Those who came to these small towns did so in search of a better life, and to make the province a better place, much as those who are now coming to the communities along Highway 13 today.",
