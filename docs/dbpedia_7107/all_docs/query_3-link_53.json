Saskatchewan’s straight borders show how the land was carved up to attract settlers.\n\nThe settlement push was intended to prevent a claim on the sparsely populated territory by the United States; it resulted in Saskatchewan becoming the third most populous province for decades, behind only Ontario and Quebec.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNot only did Saskatchewan eventually drop from No. 3, the shift in where people lived and how they made a living began right away.\n\n“Once the province was initially settled, almost immediately technology changed,” explains Rose Olfert, professor emerita at the University of Saskatchewan’s Johnson Shoyama School of Public Policy.\n\n“The horse and wagon was replaced by the internal combustion engine. It soon became the case that larger-sized farms were much more economical and produced goods much more efficiently. So farms very rapidly became much larger.”\n\nThat change meant fewer farms and an ongoing move from predominantly rural to mostly urban — depending on how you define those terms.\n\nYet Saskatchewan remains distinctly rural in the context of Canada.\n\nIn 2016, according to information from the last census, Saskatchewan had 3.1 per cent of Canada’s total population, but 15.8 per cent of the farm population.\n\nDuring the first quarter of the 20th century, Saskatchewan’s population exploded to 820,738 in 1926 from 91,279 in 1901. But it also grew increasingly urban in that same period, with the rural population dropping to 70.45 per cent from 81.2 per cent.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe province with the name derived from the Cree word for “swiftly flowing river” achieved official provincial status in 1905 and became the third largest province by 1911 with 492,432 people.\n\nThe province maintained the third largest population into the 1940s, hitting 921,785 by 1931 before declining to 895,992 by 1941.\n\nBy 1951, Saskatchewan had dropped out of the top three for good.\n\nAlso, during the first quarter of the 20th century, the farms in Saskatchewan skyrocketed.\n\nFrom 1901 to 1926, the number of occupied farms grew to 117,781 from 13,445 and the area dedicated to farming increased to 45.9 million acres from 3.8 million.\n\nIn 1926, Saskatchewan boasted nearly as many farms as the combined 130,381 farms in Alberta and Manitoba and had more area occupied by farms than the combined 43 million acres in both neighbouring provinces.\n\n“Agriculture was always export geared in Saskatchewan,” Olfert explains. “Saskatchewan would not exist had it not been for the attraction of growing grain here on the Prairies and exporting it to Europe. That was the only reason why they bothered with settling people here at all.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut the number of farms and the share of the population living in rural areas has been in steady decline for decades. The rural population has declined in actual numbers, too, after peaking at 630,880 in 1931, which was 68 per cent of the total population at the time.\n\nIn 1901, prior to official province status, the area covered by Saskatchewan was home to 91,279 people with 15.6 per cent living in urban areas, or about 14,266 folks — fewer than the current population of North Battleford.\n\nOlfert says the shift in Saskatchewan reflects what’s been happening around the world.\n\n“It’s a long, long process,” she says. “The general pattern, trend doesn’t change. There are variants. There are some exceptions. There’s nothing magical or sinister. Nobody has done any of this by design. It’s just the way people live and function and what works.”\n\n‘More urban’\n\nThrough the first half of the 20th century, Saskatchewan’s shift from rural to urban was gradual, with nearly 70 per cent of people living in rural areas as the 1950s began. Then, the urban revolution hit.\n\nIn 1961, Saskatchewan had the second-lowest urban population at 43 per cent, behind only Prince Edward Island at 32.4 per cent; by 2016, the percentage of urbanites in Saskatchewan had increased to two thirds.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFrom 1961 to 2016, Saskatchewan experienced Canada’s largest increase in urban population at 23.8 per cent; only Alberta was close at 20.3 per cent. During that same span in Canada, the urban population increased from 69.6 per cent to 81.3 per cent.\n\n“That’s a trend that’s continuing,” says Bob Patrick, associate professor and chair of the regional and urban planning program at the U of S. “I don’t think it’s going to stop anytime soon or change drastically. We’re going to become more and more urban. I think the big question is what will that urban form look like.”\n\nAlthough the definition of rural has changed over time, rural areas in Canada are now defined as those with fewer than 1,000 people occupying a territory with fewer than 400 people per square kilometre.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) counters that, in this province, rural should be defined as communities with fewer than 5,000 people.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, municipalities can apply for city status once they reach 5,000 people, while town status can be granted at 500 and village status at 300.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut some towns have shrunk well below 500, notably Scott, with just 73 people in 2016. The same year, the village of Caronport had 994 people.\n\nIn 2016, 41.9 per cent of Saskatchewan’s population lived in Regina and Saskatoon, which are considered large urban centres because they have more than 100,000 people.\n\nThat was followed by 33.2 per cent in “rural” areas with fewer than 1,000 people, 17.7 per cent in “small population centres” with 1,000 to 29,999 people and 7.2 per cent in population centres between 30,000 and 99,999 people (Moose Jaw and Prince Albert).\n\nBoth Olfert and Patrick agree that definitions can prove challenging in Saskatchewan and there are differences between how others see us and how we see ourselves.\n\nIf you use SARM’s 5,000-person threshold, Saskatchewan would be considered 40 per cent rural in 2016.\n\nOlfert points out that some academic research uses a 250,000-people threshold to define urban. Under that definition, only Saskatoon qualifies as urban.\n\n“For most of the world, all of Saskatchewan is rural,” she says.\n\nKindersley has reached the 5,000-person threshold to apply for city status, but Patrick wonders whether that makes the community urban. He also points to Melfort, an official city with about 7,000 people.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Would people in Kindersley think of themselves as urban?” Patrick asks. “It all depends; they might not think urban, they might think town.”\n\nRegardless of how you define urban and rural, the trend remains obvious.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016, Saskatchewan’s population grew by 6.3 per cent to 1.1 million. The number of people living in cities grew by 9.9 per cent, compared to 2.7 per cent growth in towns, 1.1 per cent in rural municipalities and negligible growth in villages.\n\nThe urban growth and rural decline proved difficult to ignore for Romanow’s government when faced with a debt crisis as it took over at the start of the 1990s.\n\nThe pressure to address the debt prompted the NDP government to close dozens of hospitals in rural areas that were considered less viable than those in urban centres serving expanding populations.\n\nThe governing Saskatchewan Party still uses the rural hospital closures regularly as ammunition against the Opposition NDP. The measure has arguably made the NDP nearly irrelevant outside urban areas.\n\nRomanow says the decision was difficult for the NDP, which began as the rural-based Co-operative Commonwealth Federation under premier Tommy Douglas.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Those (changes) are very difficult to do; even if it’s obvious to communities that change is necessary and should be implemented, no one wants to lose their rural hospital,” Romanow says.\n\nPopulation, in general, has always been a primary consideration in decision making, he adds.\n\n“You have to be able to match the service that the taxpayers are paying (for) to their tax dollars … say health care or education or highways, with what is actually needed out there.”\n\nFarming falls\n\nDespite the shift in population and priorities, Saskatchewan still boasts a lot of municipal governments: 775 in total (that does not include hamlets, which are not independently governed). That’s more than twice the 352 in Alberta, even though the latter province has nearly four times as many people.\n\nAlberta reorganized many of its rural communities into counties in the 1960s, Olfert explains.\n\nSaskatchewan’s people now live in 16 cities, 147 towns, 250 villages, 296 rural municipalities, 41 resort villages, 25 northern municipalities and 144 hamlets. There are also 70 First Nations whose members live on 782 reserves, villages and settlements.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDespite the numbers still living in places classified as rural, the number of farms and the role played by agriculture in the provincial economy have declined.\n\nThe number of farms in Saskatchewan grew steadily before peaking in 1941 at 138,713. That number dropped to 67,318 by 1981. By 2016, the number of farms had plummeted to 24,523.\n\nAgriculture in Saskatchewan was worth $7.2 billion in 2019 or about 8.8 per cent of GDP, well behind mining and oil and gas extraction at 25.7 per cent.\n\nAgriculture employs 40,800 people, about seven per cent of the 586,500 employed in 2019.\n\nWhile all these numbers tell a story, it’s not the entire story, Olfert and Patrick say.\n\n“For the people who live in smaller cities or rural areas, they would tell you that the statistics don’t tell you anything about the quality of life,” Olfert says. “Many people are very attached to their rural communities or their small cities and they are very adamant that they enjoy a very good quality of life.”\n\nThat quality of life can create inertia that can keep smaller communities going for decades, she says. There are other factors, too, such as economic barriers.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“If you have a house in a tiny community and you’re considering moving to Saskatoon or Regina, it’s not a very attractive proposition because the price you’re going to get for your house in the small village is very different than the price you’re going to have to pay if you move into Saskatoon,” Olfert says. “So they stay there.”\n\nWith better roads and improved automobiles, travel to larger centres for services has become less of an issue for most, Olfert adds.\n\nRomanow acknowledges that technology has made contact with more remote and rural communities easier, but thinks real face-to-face contact with rural communities still rates as important for politicians and decision makers.\n\n“The modern-day technology can only help you so far. You really have to sit down and listen to their concerns, the hopes, the aspirations, the unhappinesses, whatever the complaints or the concerns might be,” Romanow says. “And I think there is a growing tendency to bypass that.”\n\nHowever, SARM made better access to broadband in rural areas a top rural issue in the October provincial election since Internet access became a vital lifeline for more remote locations during the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA rural resurgence?\n\nPatrick also wonders whether the COVID-19 pandemic has put a new spin on the rural versus urban divide.\n\nThe high number of people working from home could force a rethink of quality of life, since location matters less than it used to for many people.\n\nPatrick himself sold his Saskatoon house and is now teaching classes remotely while living near a coastal community in British Columbia.\n\n“Maybe we’ll see a resurgence of rural or semi-rural living as it’s more acceptable for people to live and work from home,” he says. “I think we’re going to see a real shift.”\n\nBut an aging population could counter any big shift toward a rural resurgence because people will want to remain close to health care and other services, he adds.\n\nIn that vein, Patrick thinks small communities near larger centres could benefit from the population shift. This appears to be borne out in Saskatchewan, with both Warman and Martensville near Saskatoon growing to become cities of more than 10,000.\n\nMore remote cities like Melfort or Meadow Lake could also sustain or grow their populations, Patrick says, as people living in nearby smaller communities may want to remain close to home in a centre with more services.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nUltimately, though, Patrick uses Darwinian evolution to explain the inevitable trend that will benefit some communities and doom others.\n\n“It’s almost like sort of survival of the fittest,” he says. “Once you have that critical mass, that centre of population and that centre of economic activity, then past that threshold and you’re going to be OK, you’re going to survive it and you’re going to grow. But if you’re behind, you’re going to lose.”\n\nptank@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/thinktankSK\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nAbandoned Saskatchewan: View the whole project\n\nEditor's Note: Changes in rural life affect us all\n\nNearly half of Sask.
