        "text": "WELCOME TO THE RURAL MUNICIPALITY OF DUNDURN NO. 314, the fastest growing municipality in Saskatchewan! Our municipality has something for everyone whether you are looking for that little piece of rural heaven or want to get out and enjoy nature or something in between. The RM of Dundurn is approximately 807 square kilometres in size and is located less than 20 minutes south of Saskatoon on Highway 11. Our western boundary runs along the scenic South Saskatchewan River. Blackstrap Lake is located in the south western part of the RM and is very popular throughout the year for sporting activities and fishing. There are many things to see and do in the RM of Dundurn, come explore!\n\nOur History...\n\nThe first reported settlers on record dating back to the 1860’s, consisted of a Metis settlement located at Round Prairie on the east bank of the South Saskatchewan River. The next flux of settlers arrived in the late 1870’s when Chief Whitecap settled his band of Sioux on the then called Moose Woods Reservation, adjacent to the South Saskatchewan River.\n\nIn 1880 ranchers started to come westward settling along Brightwater Creek and Brightwater Lake. With the arrival of the rail line in 1889 (Grand Truck Rail Line) it brought another wave of settlers looking for homesteads, from these early beginnings the Rural Municipality of Dundurn was borne; the municipality was incorporated on December 13,1909.\n\nThe townsites of Shield and Thode were established and fell under the administration of the RM until they established village status in 1978; Blackstrap Mountain was built in 1970 as the Canada Winter Games site. Camp Dundurn Military Base dates back to 1928; initially it was designated as a “relief labour camp” until World War II when it became a first-class Military Camp."
