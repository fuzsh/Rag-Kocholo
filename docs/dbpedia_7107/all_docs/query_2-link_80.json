        "text": "Home Town or Home Community:\n\nTHE RURAL MUNICIPALITY OF LeROY #339\n\nOur Story:\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Rural Municipality (R.M.) of LeRoy #339 comprises of all lands in townships 34, 35 and 36 in ranges 19, 20 and 21 West of the Second Meridian. The R.M. is 3 townships by 3 townships. Each township consists of 36 one square mile sections. Each section is 640 acres more or less. Each township being six miles by six miles results in the R.M. being about 18 miles by 18 miles. A Correction Line exists between townships 34 and 35. This survey aid to accommodate the curvature of the earth causes the R.M. to not be a perfect square shape.\n\nThe land is classified as thin black soil. The texture varies from sandy loam through to clay loam with a. small amount of silty loam. There are also small saline areas throughout the municipality. The elevation varies from 1725 to over 1825 feet above sea level. The higher elevation being to the north and west results in water flow to the south and east.\n\nPre 1900:\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of this area were the various nomadic native tribes. The known predominant natives were the Assiniboine and the Cree. They travelled about as the food and water supply dictated. Their major camping sites were along the shores of Big Quill Lake and Jansen Lake as well as along the various creeks that ran into these lakes.\n\nAs early European explorers began settling in Eastern Canada it was just a matter of time before they would travel by water and over land westward. The first Europeans in this area were most certainly fur traders and explorers. The first Europeans known for certain to have crossed this area were members of the Palliser Expedition of 1857 to 1860.\n\nIn 1856 John Palliser joined the Royal Geographical Society and with their assistance obtained a financial contribution from the Colonial Office in early 1857. By mid-summer 1857 the Palliser Expedition was at Fort Garry and obtaining the necessities for their trek westward. The expedition set out in two groups. One group travelled west while Palliser’s portion travelled south to the 49th. Palliser’s portion followed what was later to be the International Boundary west and then travelled north to join the other group of his expedition. The whole expedition travelled west to the “elbow” of the South Saskatchewan River. From here they travelled northward until they arrived at Fort Carlton in early October, 1857. In mid-October, James McKay, John Ferguson Pierre Beauchamp, a young Indian, and John Palliser left Fort Carlton leaving the remainder of the expedition members there for the winter.\n\nPalliser and his exiting winter group travelled south and east. This group travelled through what is today R.M. #339. Records indicate they crossed north of Jansen Lake and travelled south and east towards present day Dafoe, around the southwest edge of Big Quill Lake. The approximate date of this crossing was October 18, 1857. They then travelled southeast to the Touchwood Hills Post. Records indicate it took three days to cover the 146 miles from Fort Carlton to the Touchwood Hills Post. This group eventually got to Fort Garry by November 1, 1857. From Fort Garry Palliser travelled to New York to obtain an extension for his expedition plus additional funding.\n\nThe spring of 1858 saw Palliser making his return trip to Fort Carlton. Records indicate that his return group crossed this area between Big Quill Lake and Jansen Lake on about May 29, 1858 Palliser’s records state that the heavy slushy snow made the trek very difficult. Apparently it was a late spring in this area in 1858. The Palliser returning group rejoined the over wintered group at Fort Carlton on June 1, 1858. From Fort Carlton the Palliser Expedition travelled throughout western British North America. The group kept records of the flora and fauna and took specimens of some of the flora. They also kept records of weather conditions and also explored mountain passes towards the Pacific coast.\n\nAs settlement moved westward from the Red River Valley to the Qu’Appelle Valley area and increased along the Saskatchewan River a quicker route between the two districts was required. This resulted in the establishment of the “Carlton Trail” and “Carlton Telegraph Line”. This trail and line began at For Qu’Appelle and ran north to the Touchwood Hills, then northwest, passing southwest of the Big Quill Lake and south of Jansen Lake to the Humboldt Telegraph Station. From there the trail had two distinct directions. One north and west to Fort Carlton and the other more of a westerly direction towards Edmonton.\n\nThe Carlton Trail passed almost diagonally from the southeast to northwest corners across what later became the R.M. of Prairie Rose #309. The Trail then crosses for a distance of one to two miles across the northeast corner of the R.M. of Usborne #310 The Trail then enters the southeast corner of the R.M. of Wolverine #340 and goes north-northwest to the Humboldt Telegraph Station southwest of the present day city of Humboldt. The telegraph line was built in 1878.\n\nBy late 1884 discontent was stirring along the Saskatchewan River in the Northwest Territories. The Metis sought out Louis Riel to lead their cause. On March 19, 1885 Riel established a provisional government. Within a week the Northwest Rebellion had begun. General Middleton travelled along the Carlton Trail passing through this area on April 12, 1885. Most of the travel was done using sleighs in place of carts or wagons. A small reason for the Riel Rebellion was a dispute with Dominion Lands surveying.\n\nAfter the Carlton Trail became a set route a stagecoach system was established. The stage not only carried passengers but also mail. The route began at Troy (later named Qu’Appelle) and followed the Carlton Trail to Fort Carlton and then on to Prince Albert.\n\nOn July 17, 1886 the mail stage left Qu’Appelle with driver, John Scott, and two passengers: Edward Fiddler, a farmer and Honorable J.F. Betts the former Territorial Assembly speaker. Harry Telford took over the driving duties at Fort Qu’Appelle. The stage arrived at the Salt Springs depot that evening where the night was spent.\n\nOn the morning of July 18, 1886, with John Art as driver, the stage left for the Humboldt Telegraph Station. Almost half the distance was covered when a single man stopped the stage and robbed it. It has been determined that this first mail stage robbery occurred about six miles southwest of Sinnett or four miles west of Esk. Some letters were taken but nothing from the passengers. A $250.00 reward was offered for information. Sometime later John Art, the driver, recognized a man on the street of Prince Albert whom he claimed was the mail stage robber. A man named Garnett was arrested, tried in court, and sentenced by Judge Richardson to 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty.\n\nThe Dominion of Canada, after acquiring the Northwest Territories from the Hudson’s Bay Company, decided to set up a survey system in preparation for settlement. The system used was based on Meridians, Ranges, Townships and Sections. The Prime Meridian was set at 98° West Longitude which is twelve miles west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Second Meridian is on the 102 West Longitude which passes between Pelly and Norquay, Saskatchewan All lands in R.M. #339 are designated West of the Second.\n\nThe townships in the Rural Municipality and the dates their initial surveys were completed were:\n\n36-21-W2nd: July 4, 1883.\n\n35-21-W2nd: August 14, 1883\n\n34-19; 34-20; and 34-21-W2nd: September 5, 1883\n\n35-19; 35-20; 36-19; and 36-20-W2nd: September 9, 1893.\n\nAll the lands in township 34 were in the pre-1905 District of Assiniboia and all lands in townships 35 and 36 were in the pre-1905 District of Saskatchewan.\n\nObtaining Land or a Homestead:\n\nAs the Indians had received their land (reserves) for signing their treaties, this left only the “Half-breeds” to satisfy. Therefore, the Federal Government set up the Half-breed Scrip Commissioners. The commissioners took applications from Half breeds who had to prove that they were indeed Half-breeds. All Half-breeds whose claims were allowed were given a certificate for 240 acres or $240.00 at the option of the claimant. These certificates were later forwarded to the Department of the Interior by the claimants or their agents and a $240.00 Scrip Note or a 160 acre and 80 acre Scrip Notes, according to the certificate, were issued in exchange. Thus the explanation for 80 acres being known as Scrip Land.\n\nMoney Scrip was payable to the bearer and was accepted by the Department on the Interior, at its’ face value in payment for open Dominion Lands. Scrip Notes for 240 acres total could only be used by the grantee personally and were assigned set parcels of open Dominion Lands. Once they received title for the land most Half-breeds sold it to land agents or investors. Very few, if any, did settle upon their land. In R.M. #339 it was found that Northwest Half-breed Scrip, as it is known, only occurred in townships 35 and 36 or what was once the District of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 1908, the Federal Government passed the Volunteer Bounty Act. Under this act any volunteer’s surviving family or the volunteer personally serving the Crown in the South African Boer War were given the choice of $160.00 Scrip or two adjoining quarter sections of Dominion Lands that were available for homestead entry, in the form of a South African Volunteer Bounty Warrant. This person could enter a homestead, as designated, free of charge and after proving up to obtain a free patent. Entry upon such lands had to be done before December 31, 1910 or it was lost. As an example, a South African Volunteer Bounty Land Certificate was issued for a local parcel, NE and NW 2-33-19-W2nd. This land was in the Local Improvement District 17-N-2 which later was part of the R.M. of Prairie Rose #309.\n\nMarch 24, 1903 saw the first homestead applied for in what later became the R.M. of LeRoy #339. Not knowing all the regulations to follow some early settlers upon hearing of free land just came and picked a parcel of land and squatted. From early family histories it has been found that quite a few new Canadians had arrived as early as the spring of 1902 and built a sod shack or even dug a hole in the side of a hill and believed that was all they had to do. The regulation was that a homesteader would travel to a Land Titles Office and file on what ever piece of land he wanted providing it was uninhabited or unclaimed Dominion land plus he or she paid a $10.00 registration fee. Land Titles Offices that served this R.M. were in Yorkton, Regina, Prince Albert and later Humboldt.\n\nLocal Government:\n\nPrior to 1904 rural government was comprised of Local Improvement Districts (L.I.D.) of about one township in size or six miles by six miles. In 1904 the Territorial Government passed a new Local Improvement Ordinance. This ordinance reorganized L.I.D.s into units of three to six townships in size. Most contained four but natural boundaries played a major role in some L.I.D. sizes. The L.I.D. system used a number-alphabet-number sequence to designate where it was. There were four L.I.D.s in this area, namely:17-N-2, 17-P-2, 17-Q-2 and 17-R-2.\n\nLocal Improvement District 17-N-2:\n\nL.I.D. 17-N-2 contained all lands in townships 33 and 34 between Big Quill Lake and Jansen Lake, that being Ranges 19 and portions of 18 and 20 W2nd. After elections at the first meeting of L.I.D. 17 four councillors elected and one was chosen as chairman. A secretary- treasurer was hired and weed inspectors plus a health board were appointed.\n\nCouncillors for 17-N-2:\n\nDivision 1:\n\nT.M. Motion 1906\n\nP.H.

All of the discussion at this meeting revolved around what later became the original Provincial Highway #6 straight south of the west edge of Watson. By the end of 1909 L.I.D. 17-P-2 closed operations.\n\nLocal Improvement District 17-Q-2:\n\nL.I.D. 17-Q-2 included all lands in townships 33 and 34 from Jansen Lake westward to include Range 22. The Carlton Trail crossed diagonally from southeast to northwest across this Local Improvement District. A very limited amount of information was found for L.I.D. 17-Q-2.\n\nCouncillors for 17-Q-2:\n\nDivision 3:\n\nJ. McKay 1908\n\nJ.D. Grenill 1909\n\nDivision 4:\n\nJ. McConnell 1908\n\nSecretary- Treasurer:\n\nLawrence Dunn 7-1909\n\nL.I.D. 17-Q-2 ceased operations at the end of 1909.\n\nLocal Improvement District 17-R-2:\n\nLocal Improvement District 17-R-2 included all lands in townships 35 and 36 in Ranges 20, 21 and 22 West of the Second Meridian.\n\nCouncillors for 17-R-2:\n\nT.J. McGuire: ?, 1908 and 1909.\n\nIt is believed that Mr. McGuire was councillor for Division 1.\n\nSecretary-Treasurer:\n\nGeorge Wilson Sr. ?-1909\n\nSaskatchewan Local Improvement District Association Convention Delegate:\n\nT.J. McGuire ?-1909\n\nSaskatchewan Local Improvement District Association Director:\n\nT.J. McGuire 1908-1909\n\nBy the end of 1909 L.I.D. 17-R-2 ceased operations.\n\nA Rural Municipality Act was passed in the Saskatchewan Legislature’s 1908-09 session. This act did away with the old Local Improvement Districts. Municipal boundaries were redrawn and the size was increased to about nine townships in a three by three configuration. This act came into force in 1910 thus the reason for the old local improvement districts winding down.\n\nLocal Improvement District #339:\n\nA vote was held on August 5, 1909 throughout the new proposed Local Improvement District #339 area to decide if the area was to remain a L.I.D. or become a Rural Municipality. The Secretary- Treasurers of the old L.I.D.s were in charge of this vote with the L.I.D. 17-R-2 Secretary-Treasurer, George Wilson Sr. in overall charge. The vote was in favor of remaining a L.I.D. One key difference was that a L.I.D. would only have six councillors while the Rural Municipality would also have a. reeve in addition to the six councillors Elections for each of the six councillors in the new L.I.D. #339 were set for Monday, January 3, 1910. Records are not totally clear but it is assumed that there was only a single nomination for each division. Therefore the first Council meeting was held on January 3, 1910 at the residence of Anthony Anstett on SW 14- 35-21-W2nd.\n\nThe first councillors and their mail addresses were:\n\nDivision 1: Alfred Guittard – Nealdale\n\nDivision 2:\n\nJames Roach – Bog End\n\nDivision 3:\n\nJohn Tallon – McGuire\n\nDivision 4:\n\nL. Billmeyer – Watson\n\nDivision 5: O.H. Nelson – Englefeld\n\nDivision 6: P.J. Vonderloh – Muenster\n\nThe first meeting listed Alfred Guittard as Adolf Guittard, however all later meetings records show Alfred. At the first meeting L. Billmeyer was appointed Secretary only for the January 3, 1910 meeting. P.J. Vonderloh was nominated as chairman Anthony Anstett was hired as Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nCouncillors for L.I.D. #339:\n\nDivision 1:\n\nAlfred Guittard 1910-1911\n\nWilliam Weeks 1912\n\nDivision 2:\n\nJames Roach 1910-1912\n\nDivision 3:\n\nJohn Tallon January-March 1910\n\nThomas J.

McGuire January-April 1911\n\nJames Roach April 1911-February 1913\n\nSecretary:\n\nL. Billmeyer January 3, 1910\n\nSecretary-Treasurer:\n\nAnthony Anstett January-October 1910\n\nAlbert Anstett (acting) Nov.-Dec. 1910\n\nAlbert Anstett 1911\n\nVacant for January 2, 1912 meeting\n\nJohn H. Shakespeare 1912\n\nIt is assumed that a member of the council recorded the January 2, 1912 meeting as John H. Shakespeare was interviewed for the position and was hired after the January 2, 1912 meeting. L.I.D. #339 joined the Saskatchewan Association of Municipalities for 1911. The membership fee of $10.00 was forwarded to E. Stingley, the Association Secretary-Treasurer. T.J. McGuire was sent as the delegate to the Municipal and Local Improvement District Convention for 1911. The convention was held on March 15 and 16 in Moose Jaw.\n\nIn January, 1913 the Local Improvement District became a Rural Municipality. James Roach was appointed Chairman at the January 6 meeting. Nominations for Reeve was set for January 28, 1913. L.I.D. #339 resolutions of local historic significance: Meeting minutes to be printed in the “Watson Witness” and “Lanigan Ledger“.\n\nBank of choice was the Bank of Commerce in Lanigan. The Medical Health Officer for 1912 was Dr. Chapman of Lanigan. Each year pound keepers and weed inspectors were put in place. The major weeds were: tansy mustard, stinkweed and wormsweed After a few years sow thistle and Canada thistle became a problem.\n\nRural Municipality of Roach #339:\n\nAt the February 25, 1913 meeting the name Rural Municipality o Roach #339 was adopted. This was the first Reeve- conducted meeting. David McCulloch was elected Reeve since the last L.I.D#339 meeting in January. At the February 2, 1914 meeting the name of the Rural municipality was changed to “Ayr” Rural Municipality of Ayr #339:\n\nCouncil meeting motions of note:\n\nThe April 3, 1916 meeting put in place a committee to ascertain the possible purchase of land from Mrs. George Wilson for cemetery purposes.\n\nA motion at the July 30, 1916 meeting states: “All men on active service who were resident ratepayers prior to enlisting shall be exempt from taxation to an amount equal to the taxes on one quarter section every year during the continuance of the war”.\n\nOn March 5, 1917 a motion was made to pay Mrs. George Wilson $30.00 for one acre of land purchased by the municipality for cemetery purposes.\n\nFrom the August 5, 1918 meeting: “Whereas the frost of July 24th “wrought” serious damage to the crops” the Dominion Government was to be petitioned to look into conditions and supply seed in 1919.\n\nA motion for a supper and dance in honor of returned men to be given at Bog End school on October 30th at 8 P.M. was made at the October 6, 1919 meeting.\n\nCanadian Pacific Railway built a branch line from Lanigan to Naicam in 1920. This line was diagonally across the municipality from southwest to the northeast. The railroad surveyed three siding sites:\n\nVigor Siding\n\nUnwin\n\nRomance\n\nThe October 4, 1920 meeting contained a motion that W. Weeks and L. Morton be appointed a committee to locate a site for a municipal hall in Unwin.\n\nThe first reference to the Unwin site being locally known as LeRoy was made in the minutes of the municipality on March 7, 1921.The April 4, 1921 meeting contained the motion to write the postmaster General asking for tri weekly mail service and for the local post office name to be changed from Bog End to LeRoy. At the same meeting it was suggested to petition the Provincial Government to undertake construction of a road parallel to the C.P.R. tracks from Lanigan to Watson.\n\nOn June 6, 1921 it was moved that the banking business be transferred from the Bank of Commerce in Watson to the Standard Bank of Canada at LeRoy. Council moved that they endorse the petition to have the name of the Bog End post office changed to “LeRoy” at their August 1, 1921 meeting. On October 3, 1921 the new plan of the town site of LeRoy submitted by the Canadian Pacific Railway was approved.\n\nOn October 25, 1930 the Rural Municipality of Ayr’s name was changed to the Rural Municipality of LeRoy #339.\n\nRural Municipality of LeRoy #339:\n\nIn 1931 Relief became a reality with the first depression seed and fodder relief to farmers. This remained in effect until 1940 when notice was received from the Bureau of Labour that no further relief be granted. It should be noted that a form of relief existed in the First World War years regarding seed.\n\nOn January 5, 1946 things were set in motion for the formation of a union hospital district. Three hospital sections were moved into the village of LeRoy from the Dafoe airport at Lampard. They were moved across country crossing Jansen Lake on Section 4-35- 19-W2nd. The hospital was officially opened July 27, 1947. Rural Electrification came into the area in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nIn 1962 the Rural Municipality purchased shares in the Humboldt Senior Citizens Home. The R.M. also supported the establishment in 1964 of Quill Plains Centennial Lodge at Watson. After the Provincial closure of the LeRoy Union Hospital on July 12, 1969 the R.M. joined by the town of LeRoy, the village of Jansen and the Rural Municipality of Prairie Rose #309 to form LeRose Lodge. The Lodge opened October 1, 1970. The grand opening was on July | 11, 1971 with the former Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker in attendance. The Lodge closed early 1996.\n\nThe town of LeRoy and the R.M. pulled together to make the building into Evergreen Assisted Living which opened in December, 1996.\n\nIn the late 1960’s it was observed that a recreation park was required as swimming lessons were being held at the Municipality’s flooded gravel pit. In 1970 LeRoy Leisureland Regional Park began operating four miles west of the town with support from the town and Rural Municipality.\n\nReeves of Rural Municipality #339 (Roach)(Ayr) LeRoy:\n\nDavid McCulloch February 1913-1915\n\nThomas J.

The cheese factory was built about one mile north of LeRoy in 1925 by Alex Dewar. The plant was capable of handling 8,000 pounds of milk per day. The first cheese maker was Mr. Carlton of Landsdowne, Ontario. The cheese factory operated until late 1927 and only in the summer. Most farmers thought they were paid for every can of milk they delivered so they would add water to the milk much to the consternation of the cheese maker. But there was a test for butter fat used and the addition of water came to an end. In 1931 the LeRoy Milk Producers Association decided to reopen the cheese factory with Mr. Reinelt as cheese maker. As money was very scarce it was decided to use script. Script notes were ordered printed by the Watson Witness. Producers were paid with these script notes. The producers in turn used the script at the businesses in LeRoy. When the cheese was sold the LeRoy Milk Producers Association bought back the script from the businesses. In 1937 the LeRoy Milk Producers Association joined the Dairy Pool. In 1943 nearly one million pounds of milk was handled. With the advent of cream shipment and the reduced milk handling at the cheese factory, the factory closed in 1949. Don Lister was the last cheese maker."
