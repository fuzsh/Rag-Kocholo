        "text": "The Rural Municipality (RM) of Moose Jaw (No.161) located in Southern Saskatchewan, is 30 minutes west of the Capital of Saskatchewan, Regina. The RM of Moose Jaw features major road and rail networks specifically Highway 2, Highway 39, and the TransCanada Highway. Canadian Pacific (CP) and Canadian National (CN) Rail have major rail lines that run through the City of Moose Jaw, the RMâ€™s largest municipality. 15 Wing Moose Jaw is home to the Snowbirds Air Demonstration Squadron and the NATO Flying Training Program. The RM also provides services to the communities of Boharm and Pasqua.\n\nThe RM of Moose Jaw has a central location. It lies at the eastern edge of the Missouri Coteau, at an elevation of 550 metres (1,800 feet). The Coteau separates the flat Regina Plain to the east and gently rolling landscapes of the Alberta Plateau to the southwest. The Regina Plain represents the bottom of a glacial lake that covered the area after the last Ice Age. It provides some of the best and most productive agricultural land in Saskatchewan. There are hundreds of lakes and pothole sloughs for wildlife and waterfowl."
