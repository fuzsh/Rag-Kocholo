I had a new buyer with an address RR1 Wymark Sask. I emailed them if there was a box # and they haven't got back to me.

I googled the address and:

Wymark is a hamlet in Swift Current Rural Municipality No. 137, Saskatchewan, Canada. Listed as a designated place by Statistics Canada, the hamlet had a population of 144 in the Canada 2006 Census. The hamlet is located on Highway 628 about 2 km north of Highway 363, about 15 km south of Swift Current.

Demographics[edit]

In 2006, Wymark had a population of 144 living in 53 dwellings, a 2.7% decrease from 2001. The hamlet had a land area of 0.30 km2 (0.12 sq mi) and a population density of 480.8/km2 (1,245/sq mi).[6]

Now I don't live in a small town so I don't know how the the addresses in a small town work. With a population of 144, you might know most of the people but just a RR, will that work?
