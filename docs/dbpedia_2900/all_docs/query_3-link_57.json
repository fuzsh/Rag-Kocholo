        "text": "Chapter 1The Budget Outlook\n\nOverview\n\nIn the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline budget projections, the federal budget deficit is $1.4 trillion this year, and annual deficits over the 2024–2033 period average $2.0 trillion. Those projections, which were finalized on January 9, 2023, incorporate the effects of legislation enacted as of that date and generally reflect the assumption that no new legislation affecting outlays or revenues would be enacted thereafter. Measured relative to the size of the economy, the deficit equals 5.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, and deficits average 6.1 percent of GDP from 2024 to 2033. As a result of those deficits, federal debt increases each year in CBO’s projections, rising from 98 percent of GDP this year to 118 percent in 2033 (see Table 1-1).\n\nTable 1-1.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Budget Projections, by Category\n\nThe deficits in CBO’s current projections are significantly larger than those in the agency’s previous baseline projections for 2022 to 2032, which were published in May 2022. The budget shortfall for 2023 is now projected to be $426 billion more—and the cumulative deficit for the 2023–2032 period, $3.1 trillion more—than CBO projected last May. The increases stem from new legislation, changes to the agency’s economic forecast, and other changes (see Appendix A).\n\nIf current laws generally remained unchanged, after 2033 deficits would continue to grow in relation to the size of the economy, keeping debt measured as a percentage of GDP on an upward trajectory. Those large budget deficits would arise because outlays—particularly those for interest on federal debt and for Medicare—would grow steadily and revenues would not keep pace.\n\nCBO prepares its baseline budget projections in accordance with provisions set forth in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (the Deficit Control Act, Public Law 99-177) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-344). Those laws require CBO to construct its baseline under the assumptions that current laws governing revenues and spending will generally stay the same and that discretionary funding provided in appropriation acts in future years will match current funding, with adjustments for inflation.\n\nCBO’s baseline budget projections are meant to provide a benchmark that policymakers can use to assess the potential effects of changes in policy; they are not intended to provide a forecast of future budgetary outcomes. Future legislative action could lead to markedly different outcomes—but even if federal laws remained unaltered for the next decade, actual budgetary outcomes would probably differ from CBO’s baseline projections, not only because of unanticipated economic conditions, but also because of the many other factors that affect federal revenues and outlays.\n\nDeficits\n\nIn CBO’s projections, the federal budget deficit in 2023 is $34 billion more than the deficit recorded last year. That increase would be larger if not for a shift in the timing of certain payments. In 2022, October 1 (the first day of fiscal year 2023) fell on a weekend, so certain payments that would ordinarily have been made on that day were instead made in fiscal year 2022. October 1, 2023, will also fall on a weekend, pushing payments due on that day into fiscal year 2023 (from fiscal year 2024). If not for those shifts, this year’s projected shortfall would be $83 billion larger than the one in 2022 (see Table 1-2). (The deficit for 2022 and the projections of outlays and deficits cited throughout the rest of the chapter reflect adjustments to exclude the effects of timing shifts.)\n\nTable 1-2.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Outlays and Deficits, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts\n\nMeasured relative to the size of the economy, this year’s deficit (adjusted to exclude the effects of timing shifts), at 5.3 percent of GDP, is comparable to last year’s deficit but much smaller than the shortfalls recorded in 2020 and 2021, which included most of the fiscal response to the coronavirus pandemic. Deficits in CBO’s baseline swell to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2024 and 2025 and then decline over the next two years—falling to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2027—primarily because a number of individual income tax provisions contained in P.L. 115-97 (referred to as the 2017 tax act in this report) are scheduled to expire. After 2027, deficits increase again, reaching 6.9 percent of GDP in 2033, the end of the projection period. Since 1946, the deficit has exceeded 6.9 percent of GDP in only five years: from 2009 to 2011 (following the 2007–2009 recession) and in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe cumulative deficit for the 2024–2033 period is projected to total $20.2 trillion, or 6.1 percent of GDP. Since 1973, the annual deficit has averaged 3.6 percent of GDP. In CBO’s projections, deficits equal or exceed 5.5 percent of GDP in every year from 2024 to 2033. Since at least 1930, deficits have not remained that large for more than five years in a row.\n\nPrimary deficits—that is, deficits excluding net outlays for interest—increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2023 to 3.4 percent in 2024 and 2025 in CBO’s projections. They then decrease and hover around 2.5 percent from 2027 to 2029 before rising again, reaching 3.2 percent of GDP in 2033 (see Figure 1-1). From 2024 to 2033, primary deficits average 2.9 percent of GDP. In the 62 years from 1947 to 2008, such deficits exceeded 2.5 percent of GDP only twice. In the past 14 years, they have exceeded that amount nine times—in large part because of legislation that was enacted in response to the 2007–2009 recession and the pandemic-induced recession of early 2020.\n\nFigure 1-1.\n\nTotal Deficits, Primary Deficits, and Net Interest Outlays\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nNet outlays for interest increase over the projection period, rising from 2.4 percent of GDP this year to 3.6 percent in 2033—higher than they have been in any year since at least 1940 (the first year for which the Office of Management and Budget reports such data).\n\nHistorically, when unemployment has been low, deficits have been much smaller as a percentage of GDP than the deficits in CBO’s current projections. From 2024 to 2033—a period in which the average unemployment rate is projected to remain at or below 5.0 percent in each year—deficits in CBO’s baseline projections are never less than 5.5 percent of GDP. From 1973 to 2022, the unemployment rate was at or below 5.0 percent in 12 years. Deficits in those 12 years (adjusted to exclude the effects of timing shifts) averaged 1.5 percent of GDP. Excluding net interest outlays, the budget, on average, showed a primary surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in those 12 years; in CBO’s baseline, primary deficits average 2.9 percent of GDP from 2024 to 2033.\n\nDebt\n\nThe deficits projected in CBO’s baseline would boost federal debt. That debt can be measured in different ways. The most common measure is debt held by the public, which consists mostly of securities that the Treasury issues to raise cash to fund the federal government’s activities and to pay off its maturing liabilities. Other measures are sometimes used for various purposes, such as to provide a more comprehensive picture of the government’s financial condition.\n\nDebt Held by the Public\n\nThe net amount that the Treasury borrows each year by issuing securities is determined primarily by the annual budget deficit. However, several other factors also affect the government’s need to borrow from the public. Those factors—collectively referred to as other means of financing—include changes in the government’s cash balances and cash flows associated with federal credit programs, such as those related to student loans and loans to small businesses. (Those cash flows are not reflected in the budget deficit, which accounts only for the subsidy costs of credit programs—that is, the estimated net lifetime costs of the programs’ loans and loan guarantees.) As a result of that additional borrowing, the increase in debt held by the public in 2023 will exceed the deficit by about $50 billion, CBO projects. Over the 2024–2033 period, the increase in federal debt is projected to exceed the cumulative deficit by $466 billion, on net.\n\nFor most years, the bulk of that additional borrowing stems from the need to finance federal loan programs. The subsidy costs for those programs are included in the projected deficit for each year from 2024 to 2033. However, the cash disbursements needed to finance those programs each year—for example, in the case of direct loans, the funds lent to borrowers minus the repayments of principal and payments of interest and other fees—are greater than the net subsidy costs. The Treasury needs to borrow funds each year to make up that difference.\n\nAfter all the government’s borrowing needs are accounted for, debt held by the public rises from $24.3 trillion at the end of 2022 to $46.4 trillion at the end of 2033 in CBO’s baseline projections (see Table 1-3). As a percentage of GDP, that debt is projected to stand at 118 percent at the end of 2033—about 21 percentage points higher than it was at the end of 2022 and about two and a half times its average over the past 50 years (see Figure 1-2).\n\nTable 1-3.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Federal Debt\n\nBillions of Dollars\n\nFigure 1-2.\n\nFederal Debt Held by the Public, 1900 to 2053\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nOther Measures of Debt\n\nFour other measures are sometimes used in discussions of federal debt.\n\nDebt held by the public minus financial assets excludes the value of the government’s financial assets. That measure reflects the government’s overall financial condition by accounting for the value of financial assets, such as student loans, that the government has acquired while incurring that debt. In CBO’s baseline projections, that measure generally varies along with debt held by the public but is 5 percent to 8 percent smaller.\n\nDebt held by the public minus financial assets and debt held by the Federal Reserve excludes Treasury securities held by the Federal Reserve as well as the value of financial assets held by the federal government. In CBO’s baseline projections, that measure increases from $16.6 trillion (or 66 percent of GDP) at the end of 2022 to $36.4 trillion (or 93 percent of GDP) at the end of 2033. (The Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities, which totaled $5.7 trillion at the end of 2022, are projected to fall to $3.9 trillion at the end of 2025; thereafter, those holdings increase in CBO’s projections, rising to $7.6 trillion in 2033.)\n\nGross debt consists of debt held by the public and Treasury securities held by government accounts (for example, the Social Security trust funds). The debt held by government accounts does not directly affect the economy and has no net effect on the budget. Although debt held by the public increases by $20.7 trillion from the end of 2023 to the end of 2033 in CBO’s baseline projections, debt held by government accounts falls by about $1.2 trillion, reflecting declines in the balances of many trust funds. As a result, gross federal debt is projected to rise by $19.6 trillion over that period and to total $52.0 trillion at the end of 2033. About 11 percent of that sum would be debt held by government accounts.\n\nDebt subject to limit is the amount of debt that is subject to the statutory limit on federal borrowing, which is often referred to as the debt ceiling. Such debt differs from gross federal debt mainly in that it excludes debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank and includes certain other adjustments that are excluded from gross debt. Currently, the statutory limit on the issuance of new federal debt is set at $31.4 trillion. On January 19, 2023, debt reached that limit, and the Treasury announced a “debt issuance suspension period,” during which, under current law, it can take well-established “extraordinary measures” to borrow additional funds without breaching the debt ceiling. CBO estimates that under its baseline budget projections, the Treasury would exhaust those measures and run out of cash sometime between July and September of this year. The Deficit Control Act requires CBO to project spending, revenues, and deficits independently of the debt limit. Thus, in CBO’s baseline projections, debt subject to limit continues rising over the next decade and reaches $52.0 trillion in 2033.\n\nOutlays\n\nOutlays in CBO’s baseline projections fall from 24.8 percent of GDP in 2022 to 23.7 percent in 2023 and then rise in most years thereafter, reaching 24.9 percent in 2033. Since 1973, outlays have averaged 21.0 percent of GDP.\n\nOutlays in 2023\n\nIn CBO’s projections, federal outlays in 2023 total $6.2 trillion—slightly less than the amount recorded in 2022. That small decrease in total outlays is the net result of a decrease in mandatory outlays and increases in net outlays for interest and in spending for discretionary programs.\n\nMandatory Spending. Mandatory, or direct, spending includes outlays for most federal benefit programs and for certain other payments to people, businesses, nonprofit institutions, and state and local governments. Such outlays are generally governed by statutory criteria and are not normally constrained by the annual appropriation process. Certain types of payments that federal agencies receive from the public and from other government agencies (such as premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries and payments made by federal agencies to employees’ retirement plans) are classified as offsetting receipts and are accounted for in the budget as reductions in mandatory spending.\n\nThe Deficit Control Act requires CBO to construct baseline projections for most existing mandatory spending under the assumption that current laws continue unchanged. Therefore, CBO’s baseline projections of mandatory spending reflect the estimated effects of changes in the economy, growth in the number of beneficiaries of certain mandatory programs, and other factors related to the costs of those programs. The projections also incorporate a set of across-the-board reductions in budgetary resources (known as sequestration) that are required under current law for some mandatory programs.\n\nIn 2023, CBO estimates, total mandatory outlays (net of offsetting receipts) will amount to $3.8 trillion under current law, $251 billion (or 6 percent) less than they were in 2022 (see Table 1-4). As a share of GDP, those outlays are projected to amount to 14.6 percent—nearly 2 percentage points less than such outlays equaled last year but still well above the 10.9 percent of GDP they averaged each year from 1973 to 2022. For some programs, outlays are projected to decrease, in part because of waning pandemic-related spending; for others, outlays are projected to exceed the amounts recorded in 2022.\n\nTable 1-4.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Mandatory Outlays, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts\n\nBillions of Dollars\n\nOutlays for the following programs decrease the most in 2023 in CBO’s projections:\n\nHigher Education. CBO estimates that outlays for higher education will fall from $490 billion in 2022 to $38 billion in 2023. Outlays were unusually high in 2022, largely as a result of the student loan forgiveness announced by the Administration in August 2022 and recorded in the budget in September 2022. The Administration recorded the present-value costs of that plan, which it estimated to be $379 billion, as an increase in outlays. In addition, modifications made by the Department of Education to the terms of outstanding student loans—including an extended pause in loan repayments and interest accrual, as well as changes that allow borrowers who meet certain criteria to have their loans forgiven sooner—increased outlays by $71 billion in 2022. CBO’s current projections reflect the $19 billion in modification costs in fiscal year 2023 that the department has recorded through January 9, 2023. CBO does not have a basis for determining what other modification costs, if any, might be incurred in 2023 beyond those that have already been recorded by the Administration. Also, in 2022, the Administration revised upward its estimate of the subsidy costs of student loans disbursed in previous years by $23 billion. Thus far, no such revision has been recorded in 2023, and CBO has no basis for determining what revision, if any, the Administration might make this year.\n\nRefundable Tax Credits. Outlays for refundable tax credits total $107 billion in 2023 in CBO’s projections, $145 billion less than the amount recorded in 2022. Outlays for the child tax credit decrease by $106 billion this year, primarily because the temporary expansion of the child tax credit for calendar year 2021 expired. In addition, outlays for the U.S. Coronavirus Refundable Credits and for the recovery rebates for individuals that were provided in response to the pandemic are projected to fall by $14 billion and $11 billion, respectively.\n\nCoronavirus Relief Fund. In 2022, the federal government provided $106 billion in direct assistance to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments in response to the pandemic. Outlays for such assistance will fall to $6 billion this year, CBO estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, outlays for many programs are projected to increase in 2023. The largest increases are for the following programs:\n\nSocial Security. Outlays for Social Security are estimated to increase by $123 billion (or 10 percent) in 2023, to $1.3 trillion. That increase stems primarily from the 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) received by Social Security beneficiaries in January 2023, the largest since 1981.\n\nMedicare. Outlays for Medicare (net of offsetting receipts) rise by $110 billion (or 16 percent) in 2023, to $820 billion, in CBO’s projections. That increase results from a decrease in offsetting receipts and an increase in outlays. Medicare offsetting receipts are projected to decrease in 2023 because recoupments from the COVID-19 Accelerated and Advance Payment Program are expected to be lower than they were last year. Beginning in April 2020, the government provided about $100 billion in assistance to Medicare providers under that program. That sum was to be recouped later through reductions in claim payments. Because most of the outstanding amounts were recouped in 2021 and 2022, CBO expects such receipts to fall from $62 billion in 2022 to $3 billion in 2023. Additionally, Medicare outlays are projected to rise in 2023 because of increases in enrollment (which is projected to rise by 2 percent), payment rates, and spending related to beneficiaries’ use of care.\n\nSpectrum Auction Receipts. Under current law, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) occasionally auctions licenses for commercial use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the auctions’ receipts result from businesslike or market-oriented transactions between private parties and the federal government, they are recorded as offsetting receipts, or reductions in mandatory outlays, rather than as revenues generated through exercise of the federal government’s sovereign power. The FCC conducted several auctions in 2021 and 2022, which boosted net receipts in 2022 to $104 billion. CBO estimates that such receipts will fall to $0.2 billion in 2023.\n\nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s (PBGC’s) net outlays are projected to rise by $69 billion in 2023, to $71 billion. That increase is almost entirely the result of spending from PBGC’s special financial assistance program, which will make onetime payments to financially troubled multiemployer pension plans that qualify for assistance.\n\nTaken together, outlays for all other mandatory programs are estimated to rise, on net, by $40 billion (or 3 percent) in 2023. The largest of those changes are for the following programs:\n\nVeterans’ Programs. Mandatory outlays for veterans’ benefits increase in CBO’s projections by $22 billion (or 15 percent) in 2023, to $173 billion. That increase is primarily the result of the 8.7 percent COLA for veterans’ compensation and pensions. In addition, enactment of the Honoring Our PACT Act (P.L. 117-168) increased mandatory spending for a variety of benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances.\n\nFederal Housing Administration’s Credit Programs. In 2022, the Department of Housing and Urban Development recorded a $22 billion reduction in the estimated subsidy costs of credit programs administered by the Federal Housing Administration, thus lowering outlays for the year. CBO has not included any such revisions in its current projections for 2023 because it has no basis for determining what revisions, if any, the Administration will make this year.\n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Outlays for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are projected to fall by $21 billion (or 14 percent) in 2023, to $127 billion. That decrease largely stems from the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA), 2023 (P.L. 117-328), enacted on December 29, 2022. That law lowered the amount of additional benefits provided through the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer program. That program, introduced in 2020 in response to the pandemic, provides food benefits during the summer months to families with schoolchildren. In addition, the CAA ended, in February 2023, the emergency allotments that were provided to SNAP participants during the pandemic.\n\nChanges in mandatory spending for a variety of other programs and activities—including Medicaid, subsidies for health insurance, and federal retirement programs—account for the remainder of the increase.\n\nDiscretionary Spending. Discretionary spending encompasses an array of federal activities that are funded through or controlled by appropriations. That category includes most defense spending; spending for many nondefense activities, such as elementary and secondary education, housing assistance, international affairs, and the administration of justice; and outlays for highway programs. In any year, some discretionary outlays arise from budget authority provided in the same year, and some arise from appropriations made in previous years.\n\nIn CBO’s baseline projections, discretionary budget authority for 2023 totals $1.8 trillion, $38 billion (or 2 percent) more than the amount provided in 2022 (see Table 1-5). (When the obligation limitations that govern discretionary spending for certain transportation programs are accounted for, funding is $40 billion more this year than it was last year.)\n\nTable 1-5.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Discretionary Spending, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts\n\nBillions of Dollars\n\nThe 2 percent increase in budget authority in 2023 is the net result of larger changes in different types of funding for this year:\n\nFunding provided in division J of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, P.L. 117-58) and division B of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA, P.L. 117-159) boosted budget authority in 2022 by $165 billion. Those laws also provided advance appropriations over the 2023–2026 period. The advance appropriations for 2023, which are designated as an emergency requirement, total $70 billion, which is $95 billion less than the 2022 amounts.\n\nFunding for 2023 (other than that provided by the IIJA and the BSCA) designated as an emergency requirement is $103 billion; such funding was $98 billion last year. Most of that other emergency funding is for assistance following natural disasters and to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNonemergency discretionary funding for 2023 totals $1.7 trillion, $129 billion (or 9 percent) more than the $1.5 trillion provided in 2022. That funding was primarily provided by the 2023 CAA.\n\nCBO anticipates that if no further appropriations are provided this year, discretionary outlays will total $1.7 trillion in 2023—$84 billion (or 5 percent) more than they were last year. The agency expects outlays to rise by more than the increase in budget authority this year, primarily because of spending from budget authority provided in previous years.\n\nIn CBO’s projections, discretionary funding for defense totals $891 billion in 2023, a $75 billion—or 9 percent—increase from the sum provided in 2022. Emergency-designated defense funding, which totaled $34 billion in 2022, dips slightly to $33 billion in 2023. Outlays for defense are estimated to be $800 billion in 2023. That amount is $54 billion, or 7 percent, more than such outlays in 2022.\n\nOverall, funding for nondefense discretionary programs decreases by $37 billion—or 4 percent—from 2022 to 2023 in CBO’s projections. Funding from advance appropriations provided in division J of the IIJA and in the BSCA decreases by $95 billion, and emergency funding from other sources increases by $5 billion. All other funding for nondefense programs increases by $53 billion, or 7 percent, to $793 billion. Under current law, CBO estimates, nondefense discretionary outlays in 2023 will total $941 billion, an increase of $30 billion (or 3 percent) from outlays recorded last year.\n\nNet Interest Outlays. In the budget, net outlays for interest consist of the government’s interest payments on federal debt, offset by interest income that the government receives. Net interest outlays are dominated by the interest paid to holders of the debt that the Treasury issues to the public. The Treasury also pays interest on debt issued to trust funds and other government accounts, but such payments are intragovernmental transactions that have no effect on the budget deficit.\n\nNet outlays for interest, which rose by 35 percent last year, are projected to increase by 35 percent again this year, from $475 billion in 2022 to $640 billion. Relative to the size of the economy, those outlays will rise from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2022 to 2.4 percent in 2023, nearly one percentage point higher than their level in 2021. The projected increase in 2023 occurs primarily because the average interest rate that the Treasury pays on its debt has risen sharply this year and is expected to rise further as maturing securities are refinanced at rates that are higher than those that prevailed when they were initially issued. For example, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes averaged 1.3 percent in 2021 and 2.4 percent in 2022; that rate averages 3.8 percent in 2023 in CBO’s current economic forecast. Debt held by the public (in nominal terms) is on track to increase by 6 percent from 2022 to 2023.\n\nOutlays From 2024 to 2033\n\nIn CBO’s baseline projections, federal outlays (adjusted to exclude the effects of timing shifts) rise from $6.5 trillion in 2024 to $9.8 trillion in 2033, for an average annual increase of nearly 5 percent. Measured in relation to the size of the economy, federal outlays dip from 24 percent of GDP in 2024 to 23 percent in 2025 and 2026 and then generally increase thereafter, equaling 25 percent of GDP in 2032 and 2033 (see Figure 1-3).\n\nFigure 1-3.\n\nTotal Outlays and Revenues\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nMandatory Spending. In CBO’s projections, outlays for mandatory programs (net of offsetting receipts) total 14 percent of GDP each year from 2024 to 2029, rise to 15 percent in 2030, and remain at that level through 2033. That pattern occurs in part because spending related to the pandemic continues to fall over the next few years while two underlying factors—the aging of the population and growth in federal health care costs—put upward pressure on mandatory outlays. The aging of the population causes the number of beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare to grow faster than the overall population, and federal health care costs per beneficiary continue to rise faster than GDP per person. As a result of those two trends, outlays for Social Security and Medicare increase in relation to GDP from 2023 to 2033. The effects of those trends on federal spending will persist beyond the 10-year projection period.\n\nSocial Security and the Major Health Care Programs. Measured as a percentage of GDP, outlays for Social Security and the major health care programs, net of offsetting receipts, are projected to rise in most years over the 10-year projection period, from 10.9 percent in 2024 to 12.7 percent in 2033. (Spending for the major health care programs consists of outlays for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as subsidies for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act and related spending.)\n\nCBO’s current baseline includes the following projections of outlays for specific programs:\n\nOutlays for Social Security increase to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2024 and continue rising in most years thereafter, reaching 6.0 percent of GDP in 2033.\n\nOutlays for Medicare equal 3.3 percent of GDP in 2024 and climb to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2033.\n\nFederal outlays for Medicaid, which equal 2.0 percent of GDP in 2024 in CBO’s baseline projections, dip slightly, amounting to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2025 and 2026 as pandemic-related spending wanes. Those outlays climb to 2.2 percent in 2033.\n\nOutlays for subsidies for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces and related spending average 0.3 percent of GDP per year through 2033.\n\nOther Mandatory Programs. Other mandatory spending—that is, all mandatory spending aside from that for Social Security and the major health care programs—is projected to drop by 0.4 percent of GDP in 2024, to 3.3 percent, in part because pandemic-related spending continues to dissipate. (Other mandatory spending peaked at 10.6 percent of GDP in 2021.) Such spending includes outlays for income support programs (such as unemployment compensation and SNAP), military and civilian retirement programs, most veterans’ benefits, and major agriculture programs.\n\nIn CBO’s baseline projections, other mandatory spending measured as a share of GDP continues to decline after 2024 but at a slower pace, falling to 2.6 percent at the end of the projection period. The projected decline occurs in part because benefit amounts for many of those programs are adjusted for inflation each year, and in CBO’s economic forecast, the growth of nominal GDP outpaces inflation. Growth in veterans’ benefits, which averages 8 percent per year (in nominal terms) after 2023, partially offsets the decline in other mandatory outlays.\n\nDiscretionary Spending. In accordance with section 257 of the Deficit Control Act, discretionary funding in future years is assumed to equal the amount provided so far for 2023—including funding designated as an emergency requirement—with adjustments for inflation. As a result, in nominal terms, discretionary outlays are projected to increase over the next 10 years, rising from $1.9 trillion in 2024 to $2.4 trillion in 2033. Outlays from funding designated as an emergency requirement (including funding provided by the IIJA and the BSCA and amounts stemming from the assumption that such funding would continue to be provided in each year) account for 8 percent of discretionary outlays in CBO’s baseline.\n\nIn CBO’s projections, total discretionary budget authority rises by an average of 2.6 percent per year after 2023. Total discretionary outlays rise faster than budget authority over the first few years of the projection period, primarily because of spending stemming from budget authority provided in previous years. After 2027, outlays rise at about the same rate as budget authority, increasing by an average of 2.4 percent per year through 2033. Measured as a share of GDP, discretionary outlays decrease steadily, from 6.9 percent in 2024 to 6.0 percent in 2033, at which point they would equal their lowest previously reported level (see Figure 1-4). By comparison, discretionary outlays averaged 8.0 percent of GDP over the past 50 years.\n\nFigure 1-4.\n\nOutlays, by Category\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nIn CBO’s projections, defense outlays fall to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2033—which would be their smallest share since 1962 (the earliest year for which such data have been reported). Outlays for nondefense discretionary programs would amount to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2033. Nondefense discretionary outlays have been less than that only three times—in 1999, 2018, and 2019—when they equaled 3.1 percent of GDP.\n\nNet Interest Outlays. Net outlays for interest nearly double over the period in CBO’s projections, rising from $739 billion in 2024 to $1.4 trillion in 2033. Measured relative to the size of the economy, those outlays rise from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2024 to 3.6 percent in 2033. At that level, they would be 1.6 percentage points higher than their 50-year average.\n\nThe amount of the federal government’s net interest costs is determined by the outstanding debt and the average interest rate on that debt. Growth in net interest costs is mainly affected by changes in the average interest rate on federal debt and by the primary deficit, which requires the government to borrow more and thus increases debt held by the public. Borrowing to pay for greater interest costs pushes up the net cost of interest further—in large part because of the way that increases in the average interest rate and the primary deficit affect each other.\n\nAverage interest rates on federal debt rise in CBO’s projections as debt matures and is refinanced. In 2024, the average interest rate on debt held by the public is projected to be 2.9 percent, 0.2 percentage points higher than it was in 2023 and 0.7 percentage points higher than it was in 2022; that rate generally rises thereafter, albeit more slowly, reaching 3.2 percent in 2033. Changes in the average interest rate stem from interest rates on Treasury securities, the rate of inflation applicable to Treasury inflation-protected securities, and the maturity structure of outstanding securities. (For a discussion of the factors responsible for changes in interest rates and inflation, see Chapter 2.)\n\nPrimary deficits average 2.9 percent of GDP from 2024 to 2033, adding to debt held by the public each year. (The factors responsible for primary deficits are discussed earlier in this chapter.)\n\nOn average, in CBO’s projections, increases in the average interest rate on federal debt account for about three-quarters of the increase in net interest costs from 2024 to 2033.\n\nRevenues\n\nFederal revenues in 2022 totaled $4.9 trillion. Under current law, revenues will fall by 2 percent in 2023, to $4.8 trillion, CBO estimates. As a percentage of GDP, revenues are projected to fall from 19.6 percent of GDP in 2022 to 18.3 percent this year, still above the 17.4 percent of GDP they averaged over the past 50 years. In CBO’s projections, revenues drop to 17.4 percent of GDP in 2025 and then, over the next two years, climb to 18.1 percent of GDP, where they remain at the end of the projection period (see Figure 1-3). Those overall changes are driven by the following changes in specific sources of revenues in CBO’s projections:\n\nIndividual income tax receipts decline in relation to GDP through 2025 in CBO’s projections, partly because the agency anticipates that collections from taxes on capital gains realizations and other sources, which have been strong in recent years, will fall. Receipts grow from 2025 to 2027 because scheduled changes in tax provisions, including an increase in most tax rates, are projected to drive up receipts in relation to taxable personal income. Real bracket creep (explained below) also contributes to rising receipts over time.\n\nCorporate income tax receipts decrease steadily in relation to GDP from 2023 to 2033. That decline reflects the net effects of scheduled changes in tax rules.\n\nFederal Reserve remittances remain near zero from 2023 to 2027 because higher short-term interest rates have increased the Federal Reserve System’s interest expenses to such an extent that they exceed its income. CBO anticipates that remittances will be significant again in 2028 and rise slowly as a share of the economy thereafter.\n\nExcise tax receipts rise in 2023 and 2024 after recent legislative changes take effect. Thereafter, excise taxes gradually decline in relation to GDP along with the tax bases on which many excise taxes are levied.\n\nIndividual Income Taxes\n\nIn 2022, receipts from individual income taxes totaled $2.6 trillion, or 10.5 percent of GDP—the highest those receipts have been in relation to the size of the economy since the 16th Amendment authorizing the federal government to collect income taxes was ratified in 1913. Under current law, receipts from individual income taxes are projected to fall this year to $2.5 trillion, or 9.6 percent of GDP—still well above the 8.0 percent of GDP they averaged over the past five decades (see Figure 1-5).\n\nFigure 1-5.\n\nRevenues, by Category\n\nPercentage of Gross Domestic Product\n\nOver the next two years, receipts in CBO’s projections decline further in relation to the size of the economy, reaching 8.8 percent of GDP in 2025 (see Table 1-6). That decline partly reflects CBO’s expectation that the recent strength in tax collections will not continue. In addition, payments of certain taxes deferred during the first two years of the pandemic and paid in 2022 and 2023 will no longer be made. After 2025, individual income tax receipts are projected to rise in relation to GDP because of scheduled changes in tax law and real bracket creep.\n\nTable 1-6.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Revenues\n\nFollowing the initial decline and subsequent increase, receipts in CBO’s baseline projections total 9.7 percent of GDP in 2033, 0.1 percentage point higher than they are in 2023. The offsetting factors that contribute to that small net increase are described in more detail below.\n\nScheduled Tax Changes After 2025. At the end of calendar year 2025, nearly all the changes to the individual income tax made by the 2017 tax act are scheduled to expire under current law. Together, those scheduled changes are the most significant factor pushing up tax revenues relative to income over the next 10 years in CBO’s projections. After the scheduled changes take effect, taxpayers will face higher statutory tax rates, a smaller standard deduction, the return of personal exemptions, and a reduction in the child tax credit. Those changes would cause tax liabilities (the amount taxpayers owe) to rise beginning in calendar year 2026, boosting receipts in fiscal year 2027 and beyond. In CBO’s projections, the scheduled changes to those tax provisions boost annual individual income tax receipts measured as a share of GDP by 0.8 percentage points from 2025 to 2033.\n\nReal Bracket Creep and Related Effects. The income thresholds for the various tax rate brackets in the individual income tax are indexed to increase with inflation (as measured by the chained consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics). When income grows faster than prices—as CBO projects it will over the 2023–2033 period—more income is pushed into higher tax brackets, a process known as real bracket creep. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service adjusts the income thresholds before the start of the tax year, which means that the adjustments are based on inflation in the previous year. Because of that lag, a larger share of income may be taxed at higher rates during periods of high inflation. Many other parameters of the tax system are also indexed for inflation, including the amounts of the standard deduction and the earned income tax credit. But certain parameters, such as the amount of the child tax credit, are fixed in nominal dollars and not adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe individual income tax system is thus not indexed for real growth (that is, growth beyond the rate of inflation). Instead, it is partially indexed for inflation, and the indexing occurs with a lag. Together, those features of the system cause projected annual revenues measured as a percentage of GDP to rise by 0.5 percentage points from 2024 to 2033.\n\nOther Factors. Over the next decade, several other factors decrease individual income tax receipts measured as a share of GDP by 1.2 percentage points in CBO’s projections. The largest factor is a projected decline in capital gains realizations relative to the size of the economy. CBO estimates that such realizations totaled 8.7 percent of GDP in calendar year 2021 and 6.7 percent of GDP in 2022—significantly greater than the 3.7 percent of GDP they averaged over the past 40 years. In CBO’s baseline projections, capital gains realizations decline over the next decade to a level that, after differences in applicable tax rates are accounted for, is consistent with their historical average. That anticipated decline reduces receipts from individual income taxes measured as a share of GDP by a total of about 0.6 percentage points from 2024 to 2033.\n\nSecond, a pandemic-related tax provision allowed employers to defer payment of some of their payroll taxes in 2020 and 2021; they paid half of the deferred amounts in 2022 and the other half in 2023. That provision boosted tax receipts in 2022 and 2023 but will have no effect in future years, causing receipts measured as a share of GDP to drop by 0.2 percentage points after 2023.\n\nThird, receipts from individual income taxes in the past few years have been larger than expected given currently available data on economic activity and the past relationship between tax revenues and the state of the economy. Depending on what factors explain those larger-­than-­expected receipts, their effects might be expected to persist permanently, end abruptly, or even reverse. In CBO’s baseline projections, the unexplained strength of individual income tax receipts gradually dissipates over the next few years, reducing receipts as a share of GDP by a total of 0.3 percentage points from 2024 to 2033.\n\nPayroll Taxes\n\nReceipts from payroll taxes, which fund social insurance programs—primarily Social Security and Medicare—totaled $1.5 trillion in 2022, or 5.9 percent of GDP. In CBO’s projections, payroll taxes rise to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2023, return to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2026, and remain at that level through the end of the projection period. That initial increase occurs because, in CBO’s forecast, workers’ earnings, which constitute most of the payroll tax base, rise slightly as a share of GDP in 2023 and 2024 and then decline.\n\nCorporate Income Taxes\n\nIn 2022, receipts from corporate income taxes totaled $425 billion, or 1.7 percent of GDP. CBO expects corporate tax receipts to rise to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2023, largely because of scheduled changes to and new provisions of the tax code. In CBO’s projections, corporate income tax receipts increase over the next decade, though not as quickly as GDP rises. Measured in relation to the size of the economy, receipts thus fall over the period, totaling 1.4 percent of GDP in 2033. That pattern reflects the varying effects over time of provisions of the 2017 tax act and the 2022 reconciliation act (P.L. 117-169), among other factors.\n\nProvisions of the 2017 Tax Act. Several provisions of the 2017 tax act affect corporate income tax receipts over the next decade and are estimated to reduce such receipts as a share of GDP by 0.2 percentage points, on net, from 2023 to 2033.\n\nSince 2018, firms have been making scheduled payments for a onetime tax on certain foreign profits. That tax applied to foreign profits for which U.S. taxes had been deferred under prior law. Taxes on those earnings, which are based on the value of those profits as of late 2017 (and which are unrelated to future business activity), can be paid over eight years in installments that vary in size. The payments thus boost receipts in CBO’s baseline projections to varying degrees from 2023 to 2026 but not in later years, thereby contributing to lower receipts relative to GDP from 2027 to 2033.\n\nIn 2022, firms were required to begin capitalizing and amortizing certain expenditures for research and experimentation over a five-year period as they are incurred; previously, they could immediately deduct such expenses. That change will boost receipts in 2023 and for the next several years as firms take fewer deductions up front, but it will not significantly affect receipts in later years. Additionally, provisions allowing firms to immediately deduct 100 percent of their investments in equipment from their taxable income are scheduled to phase out from 2023 to 2026. By reducing the deduction that can be taken on new investments in the first year such an investment is made, that change will add to receipts to varying degrees during the phase-down period but will not significantly affect receipts by 2033.\n\nFinally, changes to rules related to the taxation of foreign profits are scheduled to occur in 2026. Those changes will increase revenues in subsequent years, but those increases will be more than offset by the reductions stemming from the previously described changes.\n\nProvisions of the 2022 Reconciliation Act. The 2022 reconciliation act introduced tax changes that are estimated to reduce corporate income tax receipts, on net, by 0.1 percent of GDP between 2023 and 2033. Most significantly, the law created a new minimum tax on certain corporations as well as credits that can be used to reduce liability in excess of that minimum in subsequent years. The new tax, which goes into effect in 2023, will boost receipts in 2023, but the increase attributable to that tax is smaller in subsequent years in CBO’s projections because firms will offset the minimum tax by using credits for tax liability in prior years that exceeded the minimum. The law also temporarily expanded existing tax credits and created new tax credits for clean energy. In CBO’s projections, many of those changes reduce receipts by more in future years than they do in 2023.\n\nReceipts From Other Sources\n\nReceipts from all revenue sources other than individual income taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate income taxes totaled $356 billion, or 1.4 percent of GDP, in 2022 (see Table 1-7). Those receipts are projected to decline to 1.0 percent of GDP in 2023 and to range between 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent of GDP during the next decade.\n\nTable 1-7.\n\nCBO’s Baseline Projections of Smaller Sources of Revenues\n\nBillions of Dollars\n\nEstate and Gift Taxes. Revenues from estate and gift taxes totaled $33 billion, or 0.1 percent of GDP, in 2022. Following the expiration at the end of calendar year 2025 of a provision of the 2017 tax act that doubled the amount of the estate and gift tax exemption, revenues from estate and gift taxes rise by 49 percent from 2026 to 2027 in CBO’s projections but remain close to 0.1 percent of GDP.\n\nExcise Taxes. Excise taxes are levied on the production or purchase of particular types of goods and services, including motor fuels, tobacco, alcohol, and aviation services. In 2022, collections of excise taxes totaled $88 billion, or 0.4 percent of GDP. Those receipts decline to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2033 in CBO’s projections. An excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock, which was enacted as part of the 2022 reconciliation act, will be collected starting in 2023, causing excise taxes to rise slightly in relation to GDP in 2024. In addition, excise taxes on certain chemicals and petroleum products, which were enacted in the IIJA and the 2022 reconciliation act, boost receipts beginning in 2023. After 2025, excise taxes decline in relation to GDP, primarily because many excise taxes are imposed as a fixed dollar amount per unit sold, and the number of units is projected to grow slowly or decline.\n\nCustoms Duties. Collections of customs duties, which are assessed on certain imports, totaled $100 billion, or 0.4 percent of GDP, in 2022. Those receipts are projected to decline as a share of GDP throughout the next decade, totaling 0.3 percent of GDP in 2033. Two factors explain that decline. First, the value of goods imported relative to the size of the economy, which was unusually high in 2021 and 2022, is projected to decline. Second, CBO anticipates that some imports from countries subject to the tariffs imposed beginning in 2018 (in particular, the section 301 tariffs that apply to certain imported goods from China) will be diverted to other countries. Those tariffs have increased customs duties by roughly 0.2 percent of GDP since 2018. CBO’s baseline projections reflect the assumption that tariffs, along with any subsequent exemptions provided by the Administration, continue throughout the projection period at the rates in effect as of December 6, 2022, when the economic forecast was completed.\n\nRemittances From the Federal Reserve. Remittances from the Federal Reserve rose to $107 billion, or 0.4 percent of GDP, in 2022 because of the central bank’s actions in response to the pandemic, including its expanding its asset holdings. Remittances have declined sharply in recent months and are projected to total less than 0.1 percent of GDP in 2023. Higher short-term interest rates have increased the Federal Reserve System’s interest expenses to such an extent that they exceed its income, resulting in a sharp drop in remittances. When a Federal Reserve bank’s expenses exceed its income, it records the difference as a deferred asset (or negative liability) and suspends remittances to the Treasury.\n\nAlthough CBO estimates that the system as a whole will be in a net loss position through 2024, the agency’s baseline projections show small amounts of remittances for the next few years to account for the possibility that some individual Federal Reserve banks might record profits and remit them to the Treasury. As falling inflation allows the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, the system returns to net profitability in 2025 in CBO’s projections. Those profits gradually reduce the deferred asset through 2027; thereafter, remittances return to between 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent of GDP—equal to their average value relative to the size of the economy over the 25-year period preceding the 2008 financial crisis. CBO’s estimates of remittances are subject to considerable uncertainty, particularly regarding the path of short-term interest rates in the projection period.\n\nMiscellaneous Fees and Fines. Receipts from other fees and fines totaled $29 billion, or 0.1 percent of GDP, in 2022. Those receipts are projected to remain at 0.1 percent of GDP every year through 2033.\n\nTax Expenditures\n\nMany exclusions, deductions, credits, and preferential rates in the federal tax system cause revenues to be lower than they would be otherwise for any underlying set of tax rates. Such provisions resemble federal spending and contribute to the budget deficit; thus, they are known as tax expenditures.\n\nLike federal spending, tax expenditures provide financial assistance for specific activities, entities, or groups of people. However, the budgetary treatment of tax expenditures differs from that of spending programs. Although tax expenditures increase the deficit by reducing the government’s revenue collections, the amount of forgone revenues attributable to specific tax expenditures (or to tax expenditures in general) is not typically recorded separately in the budget, unlike outlays for each spending program. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires that the federal budget list tax expenditures. The Administration regularly publishes estimates of tax expenditures prepared by the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis, and the Congress publishes estimates prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT).\n\nTax expenditures have a large effect on the federal budget. In fiscal year 2023, the value of the more than 200 tax expenditures in the individual and corporate income tax systems (including their effects on payroll taxes) is estimated to be $1.9 trillion, or 7.4 percent of GDP. That amount, which was calculated by CBO on the basis of estimates prepared by JCT, equals about 40 percent of all federal revenues in 2023 and exceeds projected outlays for all discretionary programs combined (see Figure 1-6).\n\nFigure 1-6.\n\nEstimated Outlays, Revenues, and Tax Expenditures in 2023\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nSimply adding up the estimates for specific tax expenditures does not account for the interactions that may occur among those tax provisions. For instance, the total tax expenditure for all itemized deductions would be smaller than the sum of the separate tax expenditures for each deduction. The reason is that all taxpayers would claim the standard deduction if there were no itemized deductions; but if only one or a few itemized deductions were removed, many taxpayers would still choose to itemize. The progressive structure of the tax brackets ensures that the opposite would be the case with income exclusions. In other words, the tax expenditure for all exclusions considered together would be greater than the sum of the separate tax expenditures for each exclusion. In 2023, those and other factors are expected to be approximately offsetting, so the total amount of tax expenditures is projected to roughly equal the sum of the individual tax expenditures.\n\nEstimates of tax expenditures measure the difference between households’ and businesses’ tax liability under current law and the tax liability they would have incurred if the provisions generating those tax expenditures were repealed and taxpayers’ behavior was unchanged. Such estimates do not represent the amount of revenues that would be raised if those provisions were eliminated, because the changes in incentives that would result from eliminating those provisions would lead households and businesses to modify their behavior in ways that would lessen the effect on revenues.\n\nThe Long-Term Outlook for the Budget\n\nBeyond the coming decade, the fiscal outlook for the United States is challenging. In CBO’s projections, budget deficits grow in relation to GDP as growth in outlays (largely driven by rising interest costs and increased spending on Medicare) outpaces growth in revenues. Those rising deficits boost federal debt dramatically over the next three decades (see Table 1-8). In 2053, debt is projected to reach 195 percent of GDP—far higher than it has ever been—and to be on track to rise even further (see Figure 1-2).\n\nTable 1-8.\n\nKey Projections in CBO’s Baseline, Adjusted to Exclude Effects of Timing Shifts, Through 2053\n\nPercentage of Gross Domestic Product\n\nMeasured as a percentage of GDP, federal debt is higher in CBO’s current projections than it was in the agency’s most recent long-term projections, which were published in July 2022. Deficits in most years of the 2033–2052 period are also now projected to be larger than the agency projected last July. (See Box 1-1 for details about CBO’s long-term budget projections.)\n\nBox 1-1.\n\nDetails About CBO’s Long-Term Budget Projections\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office’s long-term projections follow the agency’s 10-year baseline budget projections and then extend the concepts underlying them for an additional 20 years. Those projections depend on the agency’s projections of economic and demographic developments, which are uncertain. But even if conditions were more favorable than those underlying the extended baseline projections, if current laws generally remained unchanged, federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) would almost certainly be much higher in 30 years than it is today.\n\nDeficits and Debt\n\nIn CBO’s projections, federal deficits rise from 6.9 percent of GDP in 2033 to 11.2 percent of GDP in 2053. That projected growth in total deficits is largely driven by increases in interest costs and spending on Medicare. Primary deficits—that is, deficits excluding net outlays for interest—grow by far less than total deficits, increasing from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2033 to 3.9 percent in 2053.\n\nAs a result of mounting deficits, federal debt held by the public rises from 118 percent of GDP in 2033 to 195 percent of GDP in 2053. Debt that is high and rising as a percentage of GDP tends to slow economic growth, push up interest payments to foreign holders of U.S. debt, heighten the risk of a fiscal crisis, and make the U.S. fiscal position more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates. Concern about those consequences puts pressure on future decisions about tax and spending policies.\n\nSpending\n\nTotal outlays increase from 24.9 percent of GDP in 2033 to 30.2 percent in 2053 in CBO’s projections. Rising interest costs and growth in spending on the major health care programs, particularly Medicare, and on Social Security are significant drivers of that increase. Noninterest outlays—that is, all spending other than net outlays for interest—are projected to increase from 21.3 percent of GDP to 23.0 percent over the period. Mandatory spending increases from 15.3 percent of GDP in 2033 to 17.2 percent of GDP in 2053. Discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to decline from 2033 to 2037 and is assumed to remain constant thereafter.\n\nDriven by rising interest rates and growing deficits, net interest costs more than double from 2033 to 2053 in CBO’s projections, increasing from 3.6 percent of GDP to 7.3 percent. The average interest rate on federal debt is projected to rise from 3.3 percent to 4.0 percent over the 20-year period. On average, in CBO’s projections, increases in the average interest rate account for about three-fifths of the rise in net interest costs over that period.\n\nRevenues\n\nRevenues increase from 18.1 percent of GDP in 2033 to 19.1 percent in 2053 in CBO’s projections. Individual income taxes rise in relation to GDP over that period as real income growth (that is, growth adjusted to remove the effects of inflation) pushes an increasing share of income into higher tax brackets—a phenomenon known as real bracket creep. Revenues from other sources, on net, change little from 2033 to 2053.\n\nChanges to CBO’s Long-Term Projections Since July 2022\n\nAs a percentage of GDP, federal debt is now projected to be higher than it was projected to be in July 2022, when CBO last updated its long-term budget projections. That difference stems from an increase in CBO’s projections of spending—in particular, net interest outlays—as a percentage of GDP over the 2033–2043 period and a reduction in projected revenues throughout the 2033–2052 period. (Nominal GDP is now projected to be higher than it was previously projected to be, so a given dollar amount of spending, revenues, deficits, or debt equals a smaller percentage of GDP in the current projections than it would have equaled in last year’s projections. In other words, an increase in CBO’s projections of spending as a percentage of GDP means that projected nominal spending has risen by a greater percentage than projected nominal GDP has since last July.)\n\nChanges to CBO’s Projections of Deficits and Debt. Total federal deficits through 2044 are now projected to be larger than they were previously projected to be; thereafter, projected deficits are now slightly smaller than they were in July 2022. Primary deficits are now projected to be larger than previously projected throughout the 2033–2052 period. As a result of changes to deficits, federal debt as a percentage of GDP is now projected to be 8 percentage points higher, on average, from 2033 to 2043 and 6 percentage points higher, on average, from 2044 to 2052.\n\nChanges to CBO’s Projections of Spending. Measured as a percentage of GDP, noninterest outlays over the 2033–2052 period are roughly the same, on average, in CBO’s current projections as they were in the agency’s July 2022 projections. CBO increased its projections of net interest costs over the 2033–2043 period, boosting total projected outlays as a percentage of GDP. After 2043, total outlays are projected to be lower than CBO previously projected, largely because the agency has lowered its projections of interest rates and net interest costs since last year.\n\nChanges to CBO’s Projections of Revenues. CBO’s current projections of revenues measured as a percentage of GDP are about 0.1 percentage point lower than its July 2022 projections throughout the 2033–2052 period. The agency revised downward its projections of individual income taxes because it now projects that distributions from retirement plans in those years will be smaller than it projected in July.\n\nUncertainty of Budget Projections\n\nCBO’s baseline budget projections are intended to show what would happen to federal spending, revenues, deficits, and debt if current laws governing spending and taxes generally remained the same. Changes to laws—particularly those affecting fiscal policies—could lead to budgetary outcomes that diverged considerably from those in the baseline. For example, CBO’s estimate of the cumulative deficit for the 2023–2027 period has increased by nearly $0.6 trillion since May 2022 to account for laws that have been enacted since those projections were published.\n\nEven if federal laws remained unchanged for the next decade, actual budgetary outcomes would differ from CBO’s baseline projections because of unanticipated changes in economic conditions and in other factors that affect federal spending and revenues. For example, CBO’s projections of outlays and revenues—and therefore its projections of deficits and debt—depend in part on the agency’s economic projections, which include forecasts for such variables as interest rates, inflation, and growth in productivity. Actual outcomes for those variables are likely to differ in various ways from CBO’s projections.\n\nA comparison of CBO’s past projections with actual outcomes gives some indication of the magnitude of the uncertainty of the agency’s budget projections. On the basis of an analysis of its past projections, CBO estimates that there is an approximately two-thirds chance that, under current law, the deficit in 2024 would be between 5.1 percent and 7.0 percent of GDP (see Figure 1-7). (The baseline projection of the deficit that year is 6.1 percent of GDP.) The range in 2028 would be wider: CBO estimates that, under current law, there is a roughly two-thirds chance that the deficit that year would be between 3.2 percent and 8.0 percent of GDP. (The baseline projection for that year is 5.6 percent of GDP.)\n\nFigure 1-7.\n\nUncertainty of CBO’s Baseline Projections of the Budget Deficit\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nChapter 2The Economic Outlook\n\nOverview\n\nThis chapter provides details about the Congressional Budget Office’s February 2023 economic projections, which the agency used as the basis for updating its budget projections. Inflation continued at a high rate in 2022, reflecting supply disruptions, the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on food and energy prices, a tight labor market, and the effects of fiscal policy. In response, the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates. Output showed modest growth during 2022. In 2023, economic activity is projected to stagnate, with rising unemployment and falling inflation.\n\nThe Economic Outlook for 2023 to 2027\n\nCBO’s projections reflect economic developments as of December 6, 2022; the agency’s initial assessments of full-year discretionary funding for the federal government for fiscal year 2023 (which were 4 percent lower in total than CBO’s current estimates); and the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain in place. In those projections, elevated inflation initially persists as shelter (housing) costs and wages continue to rise and as supply disruptions gradually decline:\n\nInflation, which was slightly lower in 2022 than in 2021 but higher than in any other year since 1981, continues to exceed the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal of 2 percent through 2023 and 2024 before nearing that rate by 2026. As measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), inflation is 3.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the lagged effects of higher home prices on rents as well as tight labor markets. In 2024, inflation falls to 2.4 percent as labor markets soften and increases in rents slow. After 2024, inflation approaches the Federal Reserve’s goal of 2 percent, reaching 2.2 percent in 2025 and 2.1 percent in 2026.\n\nInterest rates on Treasury securities rise further in early 2023 and then gradually recede beginning in late 2023. To reduce inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raises the federal funds rate (the rate that financial institutions charge each other for overnight loans of their monetary reserves) again in early 2023. That rate reaches 5.1 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2023 and remains there through the end of the third quarter of 2023; it averages 4.8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2023. As inflation slows and unemployment rises, the federal funds rate continues to fall, reaching 3.0 percent by the end of 2024. The interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes remains at 3.8 percent after 2023.\n\nOutput growth comes to a halt in early 2023 in response to the sharp rise in interest rates during 2022. Real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted to remove the effects of inflation) grows by just 0.1 percent in 2023, restrained by declining home building and inventory investment (see Figure 2-1). As financial conditions gradually ease after 2023, the annual growth rate of real GDP averages 2.4 percent from 2024 to 2027.\n\nConditions in the labor market deteriorate in 2023. Payroll employment stagnates, and the unemployment rate rises from 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.1 percent at the end of 2023. The unemployment rate then gradually declines to 4.5 percent by the end of 2027 (see Table 2-1). The size of the labor force, which finally regained its prepandemic level in the second half of 2022, continues to rise, although at a modest pace.\n\nFigure 2-1.\n\nGrowth of Real GDP\n\nPercent\n\nTable 2-1.\n\nCBO’s Economic Projections for Calendar Years 2023 to 2033\n\nPercent\n\nThe Economic Outlook for 2028 to 2033\n\nIn CBO’s forecast, economic output expands slightly less rapidly from 2028 to 2033 than it does over the 2024–2027 period. Real GDP grows by 1.8 percent per year, on average, the same as the growth rate of real potential GDP (that is, the maximum sustainable output of the economy). The level of real GDP is slightly below the level of real potential GDP from 2028 to 2033, in line with their historical relationship, on average.\n\nIn CBO’s projections for the 2028–2033 period, the growth rate of potential output is similar to the average growth rate of potential output since the business cycle peak in late 2007; however, the growth rate of the potential labor force is slower, and the growth rate of potential labor force productivity is more rapid. Nevertheless, potential output grows much more slowly than it has over the past 30 years, partly because of slower productivity growth but mainly because of an ongoing, long-term slowdown in the growth of the labor force.\n\nUncertainty About the Economic Outlook\n\nCBO develops its projections so that they fall in the middle of the likely range of outcomes under current law. But those projections are highly uncertain, and many factors could lead to different outcomes. The upward pressure on wages and prices from conditions in the labor market could be greater or less than the agency expects. Economic output and conditions in the labor market could also vary from those in CBO’s forecast. In the short run, higher interest rates could have larger- or smaller-than-expected effects on overall demand for goods and services and demand for labor. In the long run, the pace of potential output in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic could be faster or slower than expected. Other key sources of uncertainty are future monetary policy and the path of interest rates. Uncertainty about that path contributes to the uncertainty of the agency’s estimates of the effect of larger deficits and debt on the economy. Geopolitical events, including Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, add to the uncertainty of the economic outlook, notably the outlook for inflation.\n\nComparison With CBO’s Previous Projections\n\nReal GDP grew more slowly in each quarter of 2022 than the agency expected. An upward revision to GDP in 2021 mitigated some of the effect of slower growth in 2022 on the level of GDP at the end of 2022.\n\nCompared with its May 2022 projections, CBO’s current projections show weaker economic growth in 2023 (0.1 percent versus 2.2 percent) and stronger growth in 2024 (2.5 percent versus 1.5 percent) and the following three years. As a result, the level of real GDP is 3.7 percent lower than in the previous forecast for the end of 2023 but only 0.2 percent lower for the end of 2027.\n\nThe weaker economic growth in 2023 is largely the result of slower growth of exports, private investment, and consumption. Those components of GDP then drive the more rapid growth of real GDP through 2027. Real GDP growth is 0.1 percentage point per year faster from 2028 to 2032 than it was in the agency’s forecast last spring because of greater net immigration and faster growth of output per worker.\n\nCBO currently projects higher inflation in 2023 and 2024 than it did last May. Inflation in 2022 reached the highest rates seen in the past four decades by some measures; it was higher than CBO forecast last spring mainly because of higher-than-expected food and energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine and higher inflation in shelter costs following a surge in house prices. As a result, projections of nominal GDP and national income have increased through most of the forecast period, even though real GDP is lower than the agency projected last May. Expected growth of labor compensation has also increased.\n\nCBO now expects short-term interest rates to be higher in 2023 and 2024 than it did in its previous forecast. That upward revision reflects the upward revision to inflation as well as higher-than-expected short-term interest rates during 2022. After 2024, short-term rates are similar to those forecast last spring. CBO expects higher long-term interest rates over the first five years of the projection period.\n\nRecent Economic Developments\n\nInflation remained high in 2022 as the war in Ukraine added to upward price pressures in an economy already experiencing high inflation from buoyant demand, tight labor markets, and supply constraints. In response, the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates. Real GDP showed little net growth during the year because a downturn in housing construction and a cooling of inventory accumulation offset higher consumer spending. In addition, the recovery of labor force participation was slow. Even so, employment grew at a strong pace, the unemployment rate hovered near 60-year lows throughout much of the year, and job vacancies remained high.\n\nInflation and Interest Rates\n\nIn 2022, the PCE price index grew by 5.5 percent, and the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) grew by 7.1 percent—notably faster than their averages of 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, over the decade that preceded the pandemic. Inflation in the CPI-U during 2022 was the highest it has been since the early 1980s. Growth in the PCE price index peaked at 7.0 percent in June 2022 (as measured from 12 months earlier), and growth in the CPI-U peaked at 9.0 percent, also in June 2022. The high rates of inflation reflected widespread price increases among goods and services. The PCE price index for goods rose by 6.0 percent in 2022; the index for services rose by 5.3 percent.\n\nEnergy and food prices increased rapidly in the first half of 2022, boosted by the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices grew by 12.9 percent in 2022, although quarterly measures fell in the second half of the year. Food prices, which are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in transportation costs and to disruptions in trade of key inputs such as fertilizer, grew by 11.3 percent in 2022.\n\nOther price increases, in addition to those for food and energy, were broad-based. For example, in the PCE price index, the price of shelter services rose by 7.4 percent in 2022. That increase followed a rapid appreciation of home values in 2021, which put upward pressure on rents.\n\nOther prices that had contributed disproportionately to high inflation in 2021 began to cool in 2022. For instance, the index for new and used motor vehicles grew by 3.8 percent in 2022, a historically high inflation rate for the index but well below its 2021 growth rate of 16.8 percent.\n\nIn 2022, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy in response to high inflation. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate at each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee since last March; in December 2022, the federal funds rate was 4.1 percent, the highest rate since December 2007. The interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes increased from 1.5 percent in December 2021 to 3.6 percent in December 2022.\n\nOutput and the Labor Market\n\nReal GDP grew by 1.0 percent in 2022, following growth of 5.7 percent in 2021. A downturn in residential investment and a slower pace of inventory accumulation restrained growth in 2022.\n\nDespite the slow growth of output, conditions in the labor market remained tight throughout much of 2022, as labor supply remained subdued. Nonfarm payroll employment, which increased by an average of more than 400,000 jobs per month in 2022, ended the year at roughly 2.2 million jobs (or 1.4 percent) above its prepandemic peak in February 2020. The unemployment rate declined from 3.9 percent at the end of 2021 to 3.5 percent at the end of 2022—equal to the prepandemic low in February 2020.\n\nEven so, CBO estimates that the labor force in 2022 had, on average, 1.1 million fewer people than it would have if labor force participation rates had remained at their prepandemic levels. It had roughly 1.5 million fewer people than the agency’s estimate of the potential labor force.\n\nThe demand for workers, as indicated by the number of job openings, increased at a faster pace, on average, than did the number of available workers in 2022. The shortfall of available workers relative to the demand for them contributed to strong growth of compensation.\n\nFiscal and Monetary Policies\n\nCBO’s economic projections reflect the laws enacted and the policy measures taken through December 6, 2022, as well as the agency’s initial assessment at that time of discretionary funding for all of fiscal year 2023. Those projections reflect the effects on the overall economy of changes in federal fiscal policies—that is, policies governing taxes and spending—including the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-168), the CHIPS Act of 2022 (division A of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, P.L. 117-167), and the 2022 reconciliation act (P.L. 117-169). In addition, the agency’s projections reflect the effects of some executive actions, including some affecting student loans.\n\nCBO’s projections also reflect the expectation that the Federal Reserve will take actions to continue tightening monetary policy this year. Those actions include further raising the target range for the federal funds rate and reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and other assets; that reduction is expected to put upward pressure on longer-term interest rates.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nCBO estimates that legislation enacted since the agency prepared its May 2022 budget projections will increase the federal deficit, excluding the costs of servicing the debt, by $17 billion in fiscal year 2023, or 0.1 percent of GDP, and by $135 billion in fiscal year 2024, or 0.5 percent of GDP, mostly by increasing federal spending. In CBO’s assessment, those legislative changes will increase the overall demand for goods and services in the short term, boosting real GDP by 0.1 percent in calendar years 2023 and 2024. Fiscal policy changes since May 2022 are also projected to add to inflationary pressures, pushing the PCE price index slightly higher than it would have been otherwise in 2023 and 2024 (see Box 2-1).\n\nBox 2-1.\n\nEconomic Effects of Recent Changes in Fiscal Policy\n\nIn the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment, changes in federal fiscal policies since spring 2022 will increase both the level of real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted to remove the effects of inflation) and the rate of inflation over the next few years as a result of the effect of greater government spending on demand. In particular, three major pieces of legislation enacted recently—the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-168), the CHIPS Act of 2022 (division A of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, P.L. 117-167), and the 2022 reconciliation act (P.L. 117-169)—will boost the level of real GDP by about 0.1 percent in 2023 and 2024. In addition, the Administration’s executive actions on student loans, primarily from the pause on repayment, will raise real GDP by about 0.1 percent in 2023.\n\nCBO estimates the short-term effects of changes in fiscal policies by focusing on how those changes affect the overall demand for goods and services. The effects on overall demand result from changes in purchases of goods and services by federal agencies and by the people and organizations that receive federal payments or pay federal taxes, which in turn depend on the characteristics of the households, businesses, and governments affected by the policy changes. For example, a same-sized increase in transfer payments or decrease in taxes is likely to boost purchases by lower-income households more than purchases by higher-income households because lower-income households typically consume more of their additional disposable income than do higher-income households. CBO’s estimates also incorporate the effects on inflation of increased demand.\n\nRecent Legislation\n\nThree recently enacted major pieces of legislation will affect the economy. The Honoring our PACT Act expands health care and benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances. The CHIPS Act provides funding for semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development. Some of the roughly 150 provisions of the 2022 reconciliation act increase health insurance subsidies and provide energy-related subsidies. Those increases in government purchases and financial support to households and businesses will add to overall demand. In addition, the 2022 reconciliation act will raise tax revenues through a new alternative minimum tax on corporations and increased funding for tax-enforcement activities, thereby reducing overall demand. CBO estimates that the positive effects on overall demand resulting from increases in government spending will be larger than the negative effects from increases in revenues. On net, the increase in overall demand will boost real GDP by an average of 0.1 percent over the next two years, CBO estimates.\n\nGreater demand will also put upward pressure on the prices of goods and services, causing inflation to be higher than it would be otherwise. In CBO’s assessment, the effect on inflation will dissipate in later years because the Federal Reserve will raise the target range of the federal funds rate to offset the effects of increased spending on overall demand and prevent inflation in those years from rising above its long-run goal of 2 percent. (The federal funds rate is the rate that financial institutions charge each other for overnight loans of their monetary reserves.) CBO estimates that the level of the GDP price index will be slightly higher than it would be otherwise.\n\nExecutive Actions on Student Loans\n\nThe Administration has taken executive actions that affect student loans, including extensions of the pause on repayment—begun on March 13, 2020, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (P.L. 116-136) and extended several times thereafter—as well as cancellation of up to $20,000 of debt and a new income-driven repayment plan. In CBO’s projections, the pause on repayment is in effect until August 2023, and debt cancellation takes effect later in 2023. (The Administration’s plan for debt cancellation is currently being reviewed by the Supreme Court.) The agency’s forecast does not include any effects of a proposed rule issued after CBO’s projections were completed that would change income-driven repayment plans.\n\nThe actions taken will reduce borrowers’ repayment of student debt compared with what they would otherwise have paid, thereby boosting their spending on goods and services. CBO used data on borrowers’ characteristics to estimate the number of borrowers affected by the executive actions and the resulting changes in loan repayment and overall demand. In CBO’s assessment, the level of real GDP will be 0.1 percent higher in 2023, primarily as a result of the repayment pause. The effect on real GDP will be smaller in later years. The executive actions will have a modest effect in increasing inflation.\n\nChanges in fiscal policies also affect the economy in the longer term. In CBO’s projections, high and rising levels of federal borrowing reduce private investment activity in later years. In addition, the expiration of the temporary provisions of the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97)—including the expiration of most of the provisions affecting individual income taxes at the end of 2025 and the phaseout of bonus depreciation by the end of 2026—is projected to slow economic growth.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nCBO anticipates that the Federal Reserve will continue to tighten monetary policy in 2023, resulting in an increase in the federal funds rate to 5.1 percent in early 2023. The agency expects the Federal Reserve to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged for several months, at a high enough level and for a long enough time that the Federal Reserve expects inflation to be on a path back to its 2 percent long-run goal. Thereafter, in CBO’s projections, the Federal Reserve begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate in late 2023 and continues lowering the target range through 2024.\n\nAdditionally, CBO projects that the Federal Reserve will continue reducing the size of its balance sheet until 2026. After that point, the Federal Reserve is expected to purchase enough Treasury securities to keep reserves constant as a share of GDP.\n\nCBO projects that the Federal Reserve’s policy tightening will slow the growth of overall demand in 2023 and 2024 and thus reduce inflationary pressures by increasing real interest rates. The agency estimates that higher real interest rates will reduce the growth of household spending by making it more costly to finance purchases (especially large purchases, such as houses and motor vehicles). In addition, those higher rates will reduce the growth of business investment by making it more costly to borrow money to expand productive capacity, and they will reduce the growth of residential investment by raising mortgage rates. In CBO’s projections, interest rates in the United States rise faster than the rates of its major trading partners, increasing the value of the dollar, reducing the competitiveness of U.S. exports in global markets, and reducing the costs of imports (which, in turn, places downward pressure on inflation).\n\nCBO estimates that interest rates on long-term bonds will depend in part on the expected path of future short-term interest rates. Raising the target range for the federal funds rate will therefore result in higher interest rates for securities with longer maturities. In addition, the agency estimates that reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet will also contribute to higher interest rates for longer-maturity bonds.\n\nThe Economic Outlook for 2023 to 2027\n\nIn CBO’s projections, real GDP shrinks during the first half of 2023 and is barely positive for the year as a whole as residential investment, exports, and inventory investment decline. Growth resumes after the first half of 2023 as falling inflation eventually allows the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates, causing interest-sensitive sectors to rebound. Payroll employment is projected to decline during the middle two quarters of 2023 before returning to positive growth by the end of the year.\n\nInflation is expected to decline over the next few years as the projected slowdown in economic growth, lessening of supply constraints, and increased slack in the labor market put downward pressure on prices and wages. In CBO’s forecast, inflation reaches the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal of 2 percent by 2027. Wage growth is expected to follow a similar path, declining from 4.5 percent in 2023 to 3.3 percent in 2027.\n\nThe agency expects short-term interest rates to continue to rise during the first half of 2023. In CBO’s forecast, long-term interest rates, which also increased during 2022, show little further movement in 2023. Short-term interest rates fall beginning in late 2023, and long-term rates decline only slightly in subsequent years.\n\nGross Domestic Product\n\nIn CBO’s projections, which reflect the assumption that current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain unchanged, real GDP grows by just 0.1 percent in 2023. The slowdown is caused by declining exports and residential investment and a decrease in inventory investment, all influenced by higher interest rates (see Table 2-2). As falling inflation allows the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates, the growth of real GDP accelerates in subsequent years, led by the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The agency expects real GDP to grow at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent from the beginning of 2024 through 2027.\n\nTable 2-2.\n\nProjected Growth of Real GDP and Its Components\n\nConsumer Spending. In CBO’s projections, growth in real consumer spending moderates at the beginning of the projection period, as rising interest rates and unemployment cause consumers to pull back. Real consumer spending increases by 1.1 percent in 2023 and by 1.5 percent in 2024. It then rises at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent from the beginning of 2025 through 2027.\n\nCBO expects the shift from spending on goods to spending on services to continue in the near future. In 2023 and 2024, real spending on goods declines from an elevated level and real spending on services increases, as people gradually return to their prepandemic patterns of consumption. Over the 2025–2027 period, real spending on goods and real spending on services roughly follow their prepandemic trends.\n\nIn CBO’s projections, elevated levels of accumulated savings continue to contribute to consumer spending. Personal saving rose to high levels during the pandemic, partly because financial support provided by the government to households more than offset declines in employment income, but also because households cut back on expenditures. The stock of excess savings peaked at the end of 2021 and is being spent down by consumers. Although the aggregate stock of excess savings is large, evidence as of mid-2022 suggests that the majority is held by top earners, who tend to consume less of any additional savings. Consumers’ declining confidence as unemployment rises may also slow the spend-down of savings. CBO anticipates that by the end of 2025, about half of the stock of peak excess savings will remain.\n\nBusiness Investment. CBO expects real business fixed investment—the purchase of new equipment, nonresidential structures, and intellectual property products, such as software—to increase by just 0.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, restrained by slowing demand for businesses’ output and by rising costs of debt and equity. Real investment would have been projected to decline in 2023 without the easing of the semiconductor shortage, which is expected to increase businesses’ ability to purchase new light vehicles. CBO anticipates that real investment in equipment and real investment in nonresidential structures, which are more affected by cyclical conditions and rising costs of debt and equity, will both decline in 2023. Investment in intellectual property products will grow, but at a much slower pace than in recent years.\n\nBusinesses’ accumulation of real inventories (finished goods, work in process, and materials and supplies) slowed during the second half of 2022. A rapid rate of investment during the first half of the year pushed the ratio of inventories to sales, excluding light vehicles, back up to normal levels, allowing the pace to slow to a more typical rate during the second half of the year. Slowing demand for goods will cause inventory investment to slow further in 2023. CBO anticipates that real inventory investment will be close to zero in the final quarter of 2023, subtracting from the growth rate of GDP. If auto dealers were not expected to rebuild their depleted stocks as the semiconductor shortage eases, the projection for real inventory investment would turn negative.\n\nBusiness investment will rebound strongly after 2023, in CBO’s estimation. The Federal Reserve will ease financial conditions as inflation is observed to have slowed, and businesses will find it more profitable to invest as the costs of debt and equity decline. In addition, stronger demand for businesses’ output will encourage them to expand capacity and to add to their inventories. In CBO’s projections, real business fixed investment grows at an average annual rate of 4.2 percent from 2024 through 2027.\n\nResidential Investment. Real residential investment decreased by 19.2 percent during 2022, primarily because of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. The rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages jumped from 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 6.7 percent a year later. That increase slowed both the construction of new homes and the brokers’ commissions associated with home purchases. CBO expects that continued high mortgage rates and the prospect of falling home prices will cause real residential investment to decline by another 13.6 percent in 2023. Thereafter, falling mortgage rates and the pent-up demand from strong household formation in 2020 and 2021 is expected to trigger a rebound in residential activity. Real residential investment is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 8.2 percent over the 2024–2027 period.\n\nA combination of rising demand for homes and a limited inventory of existing homes for sale caused house prices (as measured by the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s price index for home purchases) to increase by 11.2 percent in 2020, by 17.8 percent in 2021, and at an annual rate of 17.4 percent in the first half of 2022. Home prices began to fall in the second half of 2022 as higher mortgage rates choked off demand. CBO expects prices to fall by 3.8 percent in 2023, by 3.0 percent in 2024, and by 0.7 percent in 2025 before they begin to rise again in subsequent years.\n\nGovernment Purchases. Real government purchases of goods and services—such as public educational services, highways, and military equipment—increased by 0.8 percent in 2022. Federal purchases grew more slowly than purchases by state and local governments. CBO projects that, if current laws governing federal taxes and spending generally remain in place, real purchases by federal, state, and local governments will increase by 1.4 percent in 2023 as recent strength in state and local tax receipts and federal aid support greater spending by state and local governments and as increases in discretionary spending stemming from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, boost federal purchases.\n\nIn CBO’s projections, real government purchases grow by an average of 0.8 percent per year from 2024 to 2027. In particular, real purchases by state and local governments increase by an average of 0.9 percent per year during that period, supported by federal assistance, including federal education grants provided by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) and transportation grants provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58). Although those grant programs originated in 2021, their spending is expected to continue throughout the 2024–2027 period. Real federal government purchases are projected to grow by an average of 0.6 percent per year over that same period.\n\nExports and Imports. CBO projects that the U.S. trade deficit will rise in 2023 before shrinking in 2024 and 2025 and then stabilizing as a share of GDP in later years. In 2023, the projected larger trade deficit is driven by a decline in exports. As a result, CBO projects that the trade deficit will rise from 3.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2022 to 3.9 percent of GDP by the end of 2023. That increase in the trade deficit will reverse, CBO anticipates, as exports rise by 9.1 percent (at an annualized rate) in 2024 and by 6.0 percent in 2025 but imports rise by only 3.7 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively, in those years.\n\nCBO expects growth in exports to outpace growth in imports in 2024 and 2025 for two reasons: The foreign exchange value of the dollar is expected to weaken, and the recovery in services trade (a sector for which the United States runs a trade surplus) is expected to continue. As a result, the trade deficit is projected to shrink from 3.7 percent of GDP at the beginning of 2024 to 3.1 percent of GDP by the end of 2025 (it was 2.7 percent of GDP in 2019) as the growth of exports continues to increase. Beyond 2025, the trade deficit is expected to remain roughly stable as export growth moderates and imports continue to grow with domestic demand.\n\nValue of the Dollar. CBO’s projections of export and import flows are connected to its projection of the foreign exchange value of the dollar. The agency projects that, after increasing by 12.1 percent between the middle of 2021 and the end of 2022, the exchange value of the dollar will stabilize in the first quarter of 2023 before declining over the rest of the period. In CBO’s view, the dollar appreciated because interest rates in the United States rose by more than those of most of its trading partners, which increased demand for the dollar and dollar-denominated assets in international markets. After the first quarter of 2023, CBO’s projection of a declining dollar reflects the agency’s expectation that interest rates of major U.S. trading partners will rise more than interest rates in the United States, which will cause the value of the dollar to depreciate against the currencies of those trading partners. CBO projects that the foreign exchange value of the dollar will decline by 7.0 percent between the first quarter of 2023 and the end of 2026.\n\nExports. Real exports are expected to contract in 2023, decreasing by 5.1 percent. One factor contributing to that decline in exports is the expected deterioration in economic conditions abroad, which will reduce international demand for U.S. goods and services. CBO projects that the real economic output of major U.S. trading partners will rise by 1.4 percent in 2023, after having increased by 2.1 percent in 2022. As the global effects of the pandemic continue to wane, exports of services (mostly travel and transportation services) are expected to gradually return to their prepandemic levels. As that occurs, and as the pace of foreign economic growth returns to its prepandemic trend, the growth of exports is projected to rise in 2024 before slowing in later years.\n\nImports. Imports were unusually strong early in 2022 as firms rebuilt inventories and recovered from problems in supply chains. CBO projects that weak domestic growth in consumption and a contraction in domestic investment in 2023 will restrain growth of real imports, which are expected to decline by 3.0 percent. As growth in consumption and investment returns to a more robust pace from 2024 to 2027, CBO projects that the growth rate of real imports will rise, averaging 2.5 percent over those years.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nLabor market conditions are expected to deteriorate as the slowdown in growth in early 2023 reduces the demand for workers. In CBO’s projections for 2023, employment growth wanes, the unemployment rate rises, and the growth of wages and salaries slows (see Figure 2-2). The labor force participation rate declines through 2024. The downward pressure on the labor force participation rate stemming from slower growth and the aging of the population more than offsets the continued return of workers who had dropped out of the labor force during the pandemic. Thereafter, through 2027, the projections reflect the labor market’s gradual return to its long-run average relationship to potential performance; employment growth rises, the unemployment rate gradually declines, and wage growth moderates.\n\nFigure 2-2.\n\nEmployment, Unemployment, Labor Force Participation, and Wage Growth\n\nEmployment. The growth of nonfarm payroll employment is projected to slacken in 2023 as the slowdown in real output growth dampens the demand for workers. CBO expects employment growth to increase in 2024 as economic growth rebounds but to remain moderate through 2027. In CBO’s projections, employment growth is positive from the end of 2023 through the end of 2027, with an average increase of 78,000 jobs per month.\n\nUnemployment. The unemployment rate and the number of unemployed people are projected to rise through the end of 2023, reflecting the slowdown in economic growth. In CBO’s projections, the overall unemployment rate increases from 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 5.1 percent by the end of 2023, averaging 4.7 percent for all of 2023. The number of unemployed people rises from 6.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 to 8.5 million in early 2024. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, CBO projects, the unemployment rate gradually declines, reaching 4.5 percent by the end of 2027.\n\nLabor Force Participation. In CBO’s projections, the labor force participation rate remains roughly unchanged at 62.2 percent in 2023. Slowing demand for labor, which is expected to put downward pressure on the labor force participation rate, roughly offsets the reentry of some workers who dropped out of the labor force during the pandemic because of health concerns, difficulties arising from child care and other in-home care responsibilities, and early retirements. The labor force participation rate declines after 2023 as the effects of the aging of the population (which dampens the overall labor force participation rate) become more prominent in relation to the short-term effects of the expanding economy. CBO expects the labor force participation rate to decline from 62.2 percent in 2023 to 61.8 percent in 2027. In CBO’s projections, people who dropped out of the labor force during the pandemic continue to return to the workforce over the next several years; in 2026, the labor force reaches the size that it would be if participation rates by demographic group had remained at their prepandemic averages (see Box 2-2).\n\nBox 2-2.\n\nMissing Labor Force Participants\n\nThe labor force declined by more than 6 million workers from the end of 2019 to May 2020 as schools and businesses closed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Many people dropped out of the labor force or retired early because of health concerns, income from government support during the pandemic, or child care and other in-home care responsibilities. Increased mortality and reduced immigration also contributed to the decline. Since that time, the labor force has rebounded significantly, but it remains below the size that would be expected if people had participated in the labor force at the same rate as before the pandemic. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office projected what the size of the labor force would have been if the labor forc"
