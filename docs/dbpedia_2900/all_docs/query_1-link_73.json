        "meta_description": "Public schools are required to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to students with disabilities ages 3–21 who are eligible for special education services. A Nonpublic Agency (NPA) is an entity authorized by OSPI under Chapter 28A.300 RCW to contract with a school district to provide a program of special education services for students whose special education needs cannot by met by their resident school district. An approved NPA provides the student's special education and related services that are determined necessary for FAPE through the individualized education program (IEP) process. Application Forms NPA applications are due to OSPI by June 1 of each year, and reviewed by OSPI for the upcoming school year. Nonpublic Agency Initial Application – Fillable Nonpublic Agency Annual Renewal Application – Fillable Nonpublic Agency Three-Year Recertification Application – Fillable Please note that OSPI is still reviewing the applications for the NPAs with \"Approval Pending\". Once the NPA has been approved, the \"Approval Pending\" will reflect the correct application due for next year. If you have any questions, please contact us at 360-725-6075 or by email.
