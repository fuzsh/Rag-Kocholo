        "text": "SACRAMENTO, August 6, 2024 â€” Thanks to the cooperation and diligence of California residents and local agricultural officials, CDFA, working in coordination with the USDA, the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner, and Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner, has declared an end to the Mediterranean and Queensland fruit fly quarantines in Southern California following eradication of the two invasive species.\n\nThe Mediterranean fruit fly quarantine ended nearly nine months after officials first detected populations in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Officials established a quarantine encompassing the cities of Inglewood, Hawthorne and parts of Culver City.\n\nThe Queensland fruit fly was detected in the city of Thousand Oaks last October and led to the first-ever quarantine established for this invasive species in the Western Hemisphere. The quarantine encompassed areas around Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley in Ventura County: and Agoura Hills and Westlake Village in Los Angeles County."
