The BBK takes into account all areas of civil disaster preparedness and integrates them into an effective mechanism in order to protect the population and its livelihood. BBK advises and supports other state-level and national authorities in their daily work. For example, it developed methods for risk analysis in civil protection, which can be applied for risk analyses on all administrative levels. Within the scope of its responsibilities in warning the population in case of hazards, BBK e.g. operates the warning app NINA that transmits hazard alerts to the public. The Academy for Crisis Management, Emergency Planning and Civil Protection as the central educational institution of the federal state regarding risk and crisis management, and regarding civil protection is organized by the BBK. Furthermore, the National Focal Point for the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is based at the BBK.\n\nAddress:\n\nBundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe (BBK)\n\nProvinzialstr. 93\n\n53127 Bonn\n\nContact:\n\nDr. Wolfram Geier\n\nVorstandsmitglied DKKV\n\nAbteilungspräsident im BBK\n\nTelefon: +49 (0) 228 99 / 550-30 00\n\nFax: +49 (0) 228 99 / 550-16 20\n\nFederal Office for Agriculture and Food\n\nThe Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (German: Bundesanstalt für Landwirtschaft und Ernährung (BLE) has a wide range of tasks in the fields of agriculture, food, rural areas, forestry, fisheries and consumer protection.
