        "text": "Statement:\n\nEnhance Rural Prosperity including leveraging capital markets to increase the government’s investment in rural America\n\nDescription:\n\nProsperous rural communities are those with adequate assets to fully support the well-being of community members. USDA helps to strengthen rural assets by building physical, human and social, financial, and natural capital. To achieve maximum impact, USDA will leverage resources across the Department and beyond; collaborate on cross-agency efforts such as Promise Zones and the White House Rural Council, and support community and tribal efforts to form regional strategies. USDA targets funds through strong analytics, grass roots support, and asset-based strategies. Addressing the needs of economically distressed regions is a top priority; The Strikeforce Initiative coordinates USDA’s rural development, agriculture, and conservation efforts in high poverty communities.\n\nPhysical Capital\n\nThrough loans, grants, and technical assistance, the Department will provide support for decent housing and homeownership; health care, school, library, and safety investments; and broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas. USDA also supports utility deployment of smart grid, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage for maintaining reliable electric systems in rural communities. Construction of electric, telecommunications, and water and waste system infrastructure and of farm storage facilities are also a priority for USDA.\n\nHuman and Social Capital\n\nTo assist rural residents to find jobs and start small business, USDA will provide educational opportunities, job training programs, and technical support and tools. For youth, USDA promotes non-formal education programs, 4-H, and other youth development programs to transfer knowledge and develop leaders. The Department supports job corps centers and youth corps programs through the America’s Great Outdoors initiative. Human and social capital formation is also assisted by USDA funding and oversight of rigorous agricultural research, education, and extension programs.\n\nFinancial Capital\n\nTo help build financial capital, USDA will undertake a variety of efforts. The Department will pursue public -private partnerships including by structuring investment in rural communities to attract capital from third-party investors. USDA will participate in marketing efforts to reach national lenders (capital markets) and leverage USDA resources with private capital. USDA programs will provide business and industry development opportunities to develop a local economy and create well-paying jobs. To facilitate strategic decision making to support livable communities, USDA will provide economic analyses and promote successful economic development models. USDA will also provide equitable access to capital for rural minority farmers and business owners and target outreach to underserved and minority populations.\n\nNatural Capital\n\nClean air, clean water, productive farmlands, and outdoor recreation opportunities result from USDA’s efforts working with partners and producers in our national forests and on working lands. Goal 2 of this strategic plan provides a detailed look at USDA’s contributions to natural capital.\n\nStatement:\n\nIncrease Agricultural Opportunities by Ensuring a Robust Safety Net, Creating New Markets, and Supporting a Competitive Agricultural System\n\nDescription:\n\nThe economic vitality and quality of life in rural America depends on a healthy agricultural production system. Farmers and ranchers face a challenging global, technologically advanced, and competitive business environment. USDA works to ensure that producers are prosperous and competitive, have access to new markets, can manage their risks, and receive support in times of economic distress or weather-related disasters.\n\nStrengthen the Farm Financial Safety Net\n\nThe Department strives to provide producers with prompt and equitable disaster assistance, income support payments, marketing assistance loans, farm loans, and risk management tools. USDA partners with commercial lenders to guarantee farm ownership and operating loans and makes direct loans to producers to purchase property or finance farm operating expenses. USDA's loan programs are available to producers who are temporarily unable to obtain financing commercially. The Federal Crop Insurance Program mitigates production and revenue losses from yield or price fluctuations and provides timely indemnity payments.\n\nTo further strengthen the farm financial safety net, USDA will:\n\nImprove partnerships with other agricultural lenders to better leverage limited funding resources;\n\nExpand crop insurance availability and product coverage, especially for livestock, pasture, rangeland, forage, organic, and specialty crops;\n\nUse geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing, precision agriculture, and data mining to improve crop insurance products and program integrity;\n\nProvide timely disaster relief to producers using available programs, use GIS to assess damage rapidly, and partner with other agencies on disaster relief outreach and;\n\nExpand outreach for farm storage facility loans to biomass, fruit, and vegetable producers.\n\nFacilitate Access to International Markets\n\nUSDA expands and protects international market opportunities and connects agricultural exporters to customers. The Department works to strengthen the global rules-based trading system and supports development of international standards to facilitate safe trade. Cooperative efforts with other U.S. Government agencies and industries ensure that America’s producers have fair market access, understanding of key market trends, and support to overcome market barriers. To address the threats to international trade posed by high-consequence animal and plant pests and pathogens, USDA supports research, education, and extension programs, and networked regulatory, surveillance, and rapid response capabilities.\n\nUSDA works with exporters, importers, and other end-users of U.S. agricultural products around the world to facilitate sales in global markets. In cooperation with other U.S. government agencies, USDA monitors and investigates discrepancies reported by importing countries on the quality or weight of U.S. grains, oilseeds, and related products.\n\nTo further facilitate access to international markets, USDA will:\n\nStimulate greater involvement by small- and medium-sized enterprises selling U.S. agricultural products;\n\nNegotiate and implement trade agreements and support international equivalency agreements;\n\nFacilitate the overseas marketing efforts of U.S. commodity organizations; and\n\nReduce technical barriers to trade and eliminate sanitary and phytosanitary barriers not based on sound science.\n\nSupport the Development of New Domestic Markets\n\nAccessing domestic markets helps build financial sustainability for producers and provides fresh, local food for consumers. USDA supports the planning, coordination, and education necessary for thriving regional food systems and replication of successful models. USDA will work closely with partners to develop and revitalize infrastructure for regional food systems. This includes innovative new opportunities and proven approaches like cooperatives and farmers markets. USDA analyzes market trends and provides tools to help producers identify opportunities. USDA also oversees national standards for the production and handling of agricultural products labeled as organic. To increase the number of certified organic operations, USDA will support research and education that enables organic production; reduce overlapping requirements; eliminate other obstacles; and collaborate with others to make certification more feasible for small and beginning farmers and business.\n\nEnsure a Financially Sustainable and Competitive Agricultural System\n\nUSDA manages farm price support and commodity purchase programs to help balance supply and demand and conducts oversight to protect producers from unfair competition and unfair business practices in the livestock, meat, and poultry markets. Working with the Department of Justice, USDA enforces fair market practices and takes action against anti-competition behavior, to create a level playing field for producers.\n\nThe Department ensures efficient marketing of agricultural products through clear and consistent descriptions and measurements of the grade, quality and quantity of products that are bought and sold. By providing current, unbiased statistics, price and sales information USDA assists in the orderly marketing and distribution of farm commodities to inform decision-making by agricultural producers and agribusinesses and to ensure market stability. USDA will ensure that USDA-approved and licensed warehouse programs maintain adequate storage facilities, adequate frequency of warehouse examinations, and reduced product losses. USDA foods will be delivered in a timely manner, within contract specifications, and at competitive prices.\n\nUSDA develops and maintains national standards for the production and handling of agricultural products labeled as organic and examines and accredits State and private organic certifying agents. By providing education resources on organics to producers through its field offices, USDA will better serve diverse management systems including organic and specialty crops.\n\nThe Department works to ensure that minority, women, beginning, and other socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers have full knowledge and access to its programs. USDA also works with producer and farmworker organizations and the U.S. Department of Labor to improve working conditions and income for farmworkers.\n\nIncrease the Number of Certified Organic Operations and Expand Programs and Services for Organic Producers\n\nUSDA will support research and education that enables organic production; reduce overlapping requirements; and collaborate with others to make certification more feasible for small and beginning farmers and businesses.\n\nProtect the Foundations of the Agricultural System\n\nUSDA provides leadership in creating and disseminating knowledge spanning the biological, physical, and social sciences through agricultural research, economic analysis, statistics, and partnerships with Cooperative Extension, and higher education institutions. The Department conducts research, education, and extension programming to reduce the costs of agricultural inputs and to improve crop and animal production efficiency and practices. Research efforts lead to more thorough assessments of Americans’ nutritional needs; new methods for sustaining a competitive agricultural economy; and a better understanding of how to enhance the natural resource base. Research priorities include improving agriculturally important plants and animals, including those resilient to anticipated changes in climate. USDA will use the cooperative extension system to transfer technology and best practices from the laboratory into active use.\n\nIn coordination with Federal partners, USDA helps higher-education institutions with undergraduate and graduate programs in agriculture develop strong science, technology, engineering, and math curriculums, and increase enrollment in secondary and two-year post-secondary programs, especially from underrepresented groups. As part of USDA’s science leadership, the Department will continue to provide Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education grants for projects designed to help America’s two million small- and medium scale producers improve their knowledge of sustainable agriculture production and marketing practices [1]\n\n[1] 2007 Census of Agriculture. Small- and medium-sized farms and ranches are less than 1,000 acres.\n\nStatement:\n\nEnsure US Agricultural Resources Contribute to Enhanced Global Food Security\n\nDescription:\n\nAdequate food supplies must be based on enhanced trade, in-country increases in production, and the ability of the poor to earn enough to purchase food. The largest contributors to insufficient in-country production are chronic under-investment in agriculture, inefficient inputs and markets, and poor governance.\n\nUSDA supports global and national security policy through development and capacity-building of sustainable agricultural systems in the developing world. USDA’s promotes sustainable, market-led growth across the entire food production and market chain. The Department uses a cooperative approach to make strategic investments to strengthen countries’ capacity to participate in international markets, thus expanding demand for U.S. agricultural products and enhancing global food security.\n\nUSDA’s Food for Progress Program increases productivity and expands trade of agricultural products along the value chain, while the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program improves literacy, health, hygiene, and nutrition practices of school-aged beneficiaries in targeted countries. Improving the education of women is especially important due to their critical links with economic growth, health, nutrition, and improved living standards for future generations.\n\nUSDA will assist priority countries to increase capacity to develop sustainable agricultural systems and markets. This includes providing advice on developing and adopting market and science-based policies and institutions and building trade capacity. The Department helps countries create an enabling environment for increased private-sector participation in agricultural value chains, while leveraging partnerships with U.S. government agencies, land grant universities, other institutions, and the private sector to conduct technical assistance and training.\n\nUSDA will invest in research, development, and extension to improve agricultural techniques and technologies, including biotechnology. Data and analysis from USDA will assist with addressing food security including market analysis, and food security assessments for food insecure countries. The Department will assist developing countries in establishing robust agricultural statistics programs through technical assistance and training. To support the sustainable management of soil, USDA will: disseminate soil science information and technology; build capacity to conduct soil surveys; and promote the adoption of data, technology and science-based solutions for soil management. Many of these activities are carried out collaboratively with funding partners, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Department of State, Department of Defense, and Millennium Challenge Corporation.\n\nThe Department promotes agricultural policy and regulatory programs to strengthen food safety and animal and plant health systems, which help countries take advantage of new trade and marketing opportunities. At the same time, promotion of these policies and programs reduce the worldwide prevalence of significant diseases.\n\nUSDA is a key partner in President Obama’s Feed the Future Initiative, a global food security and nutrition initiative led by USAID. The three key areas in which USDA will contribute at the country and global levels for sustained and enhanced impact include: a) in-country capacity building efforts with government, farmer organizations, the private sector, and universities on agricultural policies, regulatory systems including sanitary and phytosanitary systems, natural resources management, and agribusiness, market chains and trade; b) basic and applied research, including extension; and c) market information, statistics, data, and economic analysis.\n\nStatement:\n\nEnhance America's Ability to Develop and Trade Agricultural Products Derived from New and Emerging Technologies\n\nDescription:\n\nThe United States is in a unique position to combat global hunger and the impacts of a changing climate. American farmers are among the most productive in the world, and U.S. science is among the most advanced in developing innovative solutions to agro-ecological challenges. USDA supports the safe and appropriate use of science and technology, including biotechnology, to help meet agricultural challenges and market needs of the 21st century.\n\nUSDA uses science-based regulatory systems to allow for the safe development, use, and trade of products derived from new agricultural technologies. USDA will continue to regulate the importation, interstate movement, and field-testing of newly developed genetically engineered (GE) organisms that qualify as “regulated articles” to ensure they do not pose a threat to plant health before they can be commercialized. These science-based evaluations facilitates the safe introduction of new agricultural production options, and enhance public and international confidence in these products. USDA will coordinate responsibilities with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the Federal Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology.\n\nTo bring products of new and emerging technologies to the worldwide marketplace, USDA works with other federal agencies to address trade challenges while building strong international partnerships. These efforts facilitate the safe use and trade of products produced by such technologies, including the genetic engineering of animals, animal cloning, next generation plant and animal biotechnologies and nanotechnology. USDA will continue to monitor and encourage industry efforts to enable the development and export of biotechnology products containing intellectual property whose patents have expired.\n\nUSDA supports global adoption of science-based regulatory systems and works to advance internationally accepted science-based regulations with U.S. trading partners. Ensuring the enforcement of existing global commitments governing trade in agricultural biotechnology products is also a priority for the Department. USDA raises awareness of the contributions of innovative technologies to global food and energy security, environmental sustainability, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This fosters global adoption of these technologies and their products, increases trade opportunities for U.S producers, and provides tools for addressing 21st century challenges to agriculture.\n\nAt the same time, USDA facilitates increased dialogue and cooperation among farmers who employ varied agricultural production methods. This leads to domestic and international growth for all production systems and reduces friction among diverse interests. USDA will implement, as appropriate, recommendations provided by the USDA Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture on strengthening coexistence among different agricultural systems.\n\nStatement:\n\nImprove Access to Nutritious Food\n\nDescription:\n\n.\n\nUSDA’s domestic nutrition assistance programs serve one in four Americans annually. The Department is committed to making benefits available to every eligible person who wishes to participate in the major nutrition assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Child Nutrition Programs, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). While the Department’s ultimate objective is for economic opportunities to make nutrition assistance unnecessary for as many families as possible, we will ensure that these vital programs remain ready to serve all eligible people who need them.\n\nWhile the rate of SNAP participation among eligible people has returned to the coverage levels of the 1990s, a substantial portion of those eligible for SNAP are not participating. USDA will continue its efforts to ensure that every eligible person is aware of the program’s benefits so that they can make an informed choice whether to participate or not.\n\nUSDA also intends to ensure effective and easy access to the Child Nutrition Programs for eligible children who need them. The National School Lunch Program is available in most schools. Schools can receive cash subsidies and donated commodities from the Department for each meal they serve. In return, those schools must serve lunches that meet Federal requirements and offer free or reduced-price lunches to eligible children.\n\nPromoting access to nutrition assistance goes hand-in-hand with managing these programs in a manner that ensures public confidence and maximizes the impact of Federal dollars. Strong management ensures that those most in need of nutrition assistance receive it. It also ensures that nutrition assistance programs leverage opportunities to positively impact the local economy in the communities they serve. Finally, it ensures that resources are not wasted by error or abuse. USDA uses all available opportunities, including new communication and eGovernment technologies, to serve customers, work with partners, and administer programs as effectively as possible.\n\nStatement:\n\nPromote Healthy Diet and Physical Activity Behavior\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Administration has set a goal to solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight. The First Lady’s Let’s Move! campaign has been central to this effort, and USDA will continue to play a critical role in its success. In addition, USDA is fighting to reverse the rapid increase in childhood obesity by improving school meals and the school nutrition environment. On school days, children who participate in both the breakfast and lunch programs consume as many as half of their calories at school. The Department must ensure that all foods served in school contribute to good health, and the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act provided new authority to set common-sense nutrition standards for food sold throughout the school day. USDA will work with schools to implement the new standards for all foods sold in school, and will continue to support ongoing implementation of updated school meals nutrition standards.\n\nUSDA is also encouraging and supporting WIC mothers to breastfeed their infants by strengthening breastfeeding policy and program activities. Breastfeeding is linked to a lower risk of numerous health problems for both mother and infant. It also may have a protective effect against pediatric overweight and obesity. Breast milk provides the best source of infant nutrition and helps infants get a healthy start in life. USDA will recognize and reward State achievements in promoting breastfeeding through performance awards, expand the availability of peer-counseling in WIC clinics, and continue its core promotion and support activities.\n\nFurthermore, USDA is working to double the number of Americans who eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Too many Americans simply do not eat enough of these nutrient-dense foods to support good nutrition. The Department establishes evidence-based nutrition guidance, the basis for which is the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), which are developed in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Department is also working to improve access to healthful, locally produced food in under-served communities through a multifaceted strategy that focuses on food production, distribution, and both traditional and non-traditional retail options. Through research and technical and financial assistance, the Department will help producers produce, distribute and market healthy foods locally. The Department will also encourage additional farmers markets in low-access areas to become authorized SNAP vendors, equip markets to accept SNAP through electronic benefit transfer (EBT), work with local and private partners to test and expand the use of incentive programs for healthy food purchases, and promote greater use of farmers markets by SNAP participants. Through its farm-to-school efforts, USDA also connects schools with regional and local producers to increase producers’ market opportunities as well as young people’s access to healthy, local foods.\n\nTo improve Americans’ physical activity behaviors, USDA is promoting the use of the Nation’s public lands. Most Americans need to move more to promote their health and well-being and improve the energy balance between the calories they consume and those they expend. National forests and grasslands are America’s backyard, offering chances to increase physical activity. Over 90 million National Forest System visitors participate in outdoor-based physical activities each year. USDA will promote the use of these lands and facilities to nurture the body and mind in natural settings near local communities. The Department also will increase access to green space through such programs as the Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry program.\n\nStatement:\n\nProtect Public Health by Ensuring Food is Safe\n\nDescription:\n\nUSDA is committed to ensuring Americans have access to safe food through a farm-to-table approach to reducing and preventing foodborne illness. The Department invests in its workforce and data infrastructure to prevent harm to consumers by reducing the incidence of food contamination and quickly identifying and working to prevent or limit outbreaks. Effective response to food safety issues and enforcement depend upon timely, quality data and analysis.\n\nUSDA conducts in-commerce surveillance activities to protect public health by ensuring that meat, poultry, and processed egg products are safe, secure, wholesome, correctly labeled and packaged. In fiscal year 2012, USDA ensured public health requirements were met in establishments that slaughter or process 147 million head of livestock and 8.9 billion poultry carcasses. In the same year, USDA estimated that there were 479,621 Salmonella, Listeria monocytgenes (Lm), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 foodborne illnesses attributed to Department-regulated products.\n\nUSDA also measures industry adoption of functional food defense plans. Food defense plans are written procedures that official meat and poultry slaughter and processing establishments, egg product plants, and official import inspection establishments should follow to protect the food supply from intentional contamination of food products with chemicals, biological agents, or other harmful substances. These plans help the industry protect public health and reduce negative economic impacts on the food infrastructure.\n\nFinally, as imported products and on-farm practices can dramatically impact food safety, USDA participates in and leads government-wide Codex Alimentarius activities to ensure that science-based international public health standards are in place, promotes use of Codex standards by other governments and international producers, conducts re-inspection of imported products and audits foreign countries to ensure the safety of imported products and provides guidance to promote good agricultural practices on the farm. The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (chaired by the U.S.) also adopted Guidelines for the Control of Campylobacter and Salmonella in chicken meat in 2011. The guidelines are consistent with USDA hygienic performance standards and will help ensure the safety of imported products."
