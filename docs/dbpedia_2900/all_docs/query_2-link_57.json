        "text": "Food Safety: Experiences of Seven Countries in Consolidating Their Food Safety Systems (22-FEB-05, GAO-05-212). The safety and quality of the U.S. food supply are governed by a complex system that is administered by 15 agencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have primary responsibility for food safety. Many legislative proposals have been made to consolidate the U.S. food safety system, but to date no other action has been taken. Several countries have taken steps to streamline and consolidate their food safety systems. In 1999, we reported on the initial experiences of four of these countries--Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Since then, additional countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, have undertaken consolidations. This report describes the approaches and challenges these countries faced in consolidating food safety functions, including the benefits and costs cited by government officials and other stakeholders. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS and USDA said that the countries' consolidation experiences have limited applicability to the U.S. food safety system because the countries are much smaller than the United States. The two agencies believe that they are working together effectively to ensure the safety of the food supply. -------------------------Indexing Terms------------------------- REPORTNUM: GAO-05-212 ACCNO: A18056 TITLE: Food Safety: Experiences of Seven Countries in Consolidating Their Food Safety Systems DATE: 02/22/2005 SUBJECT: Consumer protection Federal agency reorganization Food and drug legislation Food industry Food inspection Foreign governments Interagency relations Proposed legislation Safety regulation Safety standards Food safety Standards (food) Canada Denmark Germany Ireland Netherlands New Zealand United Kingdom ****************************************************************** ** This file contains an ASCII representation of the text of a ** ** GAO Product. ** ** ** ** No attempt has been made to display graphic images, although ** ** figure captions are reproduced.

However, the countries' approaches were similar in one respect-each established a single agency to lead food safety management or enforcement of food safety legislation. These countries had two primary reasons for consolidating their food safety systems-public concern about the safety of the food supply and the need to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. Countries faced challenges in (1) deciding whether to place the agency within the existing health or agriculture ministry or establish it as a stand-alone agency while also determining what responsibilities the new agency would have and (2) helping employees adjust to the new agency's culture and support its priorities. Although none of the countries has analyzed the results of its consolidation, government officials consistently stated that the net effect of their country's consolidation has been or will likely be beneficial. Officials in most countries stated their new food safety agencies incurred consolidation startup costs. However, in each country, government officials believe that consolidation costs have been or will likely be exceeded by the benefits. These officials and food industry and consumer stakeholders cited significant qualitative improvements in the effectiveness or efficiency of their food safety systems. These improvements include less overlap in inspections, greater clarity in responsibilities, and more consistent or timely enforcement of food safety laws and regulations. In addition to these qualitative benefits, officials from three countries, Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands, identified areas where they believe financial savings may be achieved as a result of consolidation. For example, in the Netherlands officials said that reduced duplication in food safety inspections would likely result in decreased food safety spending and that they anticipate savings from an expected 25 percent reduction in administrative and management personnel. Although the seven countries we reviewed are much smaller than the United States, they are also high-income countries where consumers have very high expectations for food safety. Consequently, we believe that the countries' experiences in consolidating food safety systems can offer useful information to U.S. policymakers.

A United States Government Accountability Office Washington, D.C. 20548 February 22, 2005 The Honorable George V. Voinovich Chairman The Honorable Daniel K. Akaka Ranking Member Subcommittee on Oversight, Government Management, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs United States Senate The Honorable Richard Durbin United States Senate As we have previously reported, the federal food safety system in the United States emerged piecemeal, over many decades, typically in response to particular health threats or economic crises. The result is a fragmented legal and organizational structure that gives responsibility for specific food commodities to different agencies and provides them with significantly different authorities to enforce food safety laws. In fiscal year 2003, the principal federal agencies with food safety responsibilities spent nearly $1.7 billion to ensure the safety and quality of the U.S. food supply. Many legislative proposals have been made to reform existing laws and consolidate the U.S. food safety system, but to date no action has been taken. Most recently, in 2004, parallel Senate and House bills proposed combining the food safety regulatory programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the voluntary seafood inspection program operated by the Department of Commerce. Several countries have taken steps to streamline and consolidate food safety functions. In 1999, we reported on the experiences of four countries-Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom-that were consolidating their food safety systems.1 In response to your interest in learning about these and other countries' experiences with consolidation, we updated information on the countries covered in the 1999 report and 1GAO, Food Safety: Experiences of Four Countries in Consolidating Their Food Safety Systems, GAO/RCED-99-80 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 20, 1999). included information on three other countries that have also undertaken consolidation efforts-Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. This report describes the approaches these seven countries have taken in consolidating food safety functions, the challenges they faced, and the results of the countries' efforts, including benefits and costs cited by government officials and industry or consumer stakeholders. To develop this information, we examined the seven countries' efforts to streamline and consolidate their food safety systems,2 including the benefits and costs that resulted, as cited by government officials.3 We conducted structured interviews with senior government officials from food safety, agriculture, and health agencies and with representatives of food industry and consumer organizations, reviewed and analyzed the documents they provided, and reviewed World Health Organization and GAO reports. We also met with European Union (EU) food safety officials to discuss how the EU's food legislation is affecting its member countries' decisions to consolidate, as well as how the EU interacts with food safety agencies in member countries.4 The information on countries' food safety systems in this report, including descriptions of laws, is based almost exclusively on interviews with and documentation provided by high-level food safety officials as well as food industry or consumer stakeholders from the seven countries we examined. Most of the information we obtained was qualitative. To the extent possible, we corroborated the qualitative information provided by government officials by interviewing food industry and consumer organization stakeholders. We obtained very limited quantitative information. We asked government officials questions intended to help us assess the reliability of the quantitative information they provided, but we could not determine the reliability of most of this information because of constraints on the amount of time the countries' food safety officials could devote to our study. Although we could not assess the quantitative information's reliability, we are reporting it in order to provide descriptive information that will inform policymakers in the 2For the purposes of this report, we defined consolidation as the transfer of responsibility and resources for performing a food safety function from two or more agencies to a single agency. 3In examining countries' food safety systems, we did not obtain information on agencies that are responsible for foodborne illness surveillance for each of the seven countries. 4Five of the countries whose systems we studied, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, are members of the European Union. United States about the various approaches, challenges, and benefits that countries' officials identified to us regarding their consolidation efforts. Appendix I provides more information on our scope and methodology. We conducted our work from April 2004 through December 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Results in Brief The seven countries we examined have taken various approaches to consolidate their food safety systems. Each of the seven countries we reviewed established a single agency to lead food safety management or enforcement of food safety legislation and modified existing food safety laws, although their approaches and the extent to which they consolidated differed. For example, Denmark centralized its system by creating a new federal agency in which it consolidated almost all the food safety functions and activities, including inspections, which were previously distributed among several government agencies. In contrast, Germany's new agency functions as a coordinating body to lead food safety management and formulate general administrative rules to guide the implementation of national food safety laws by the German federal states.5 The German federal states continue to be responsible for overseeing food inspections performed by local governments. The two major factors motivating countries to consolidate their food safety systems were public concern about food safety and a need to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. For example, in the United Kingdom, consolidation occurred primarily in response to a loss of consumer confidence resulting from the outbreak of mad cow disease, and in Canada, consolidation was intended to achieve greater program effectiveness and reduce expenditures. A third important motivating factor for the EU countries has been the need to comply with recently adopted EU legislation. These EU changes aim to harmonize and simplify its food safety legislation and to create a single, transparent set of food safety rules that is applicable to all EU member countries. In reorganizing their food safety systems, several countries cited challenges in two areas. First, many countries had to consider whether to place the new agency within the existing health or agriculture ministry or 5The Federal Republic of Germany consists of 16 federal states, known as la:nder. Under Germany's federal structure, the federal states have responsibilities that include the implementation of food safety laws. establish it as a stand-alone agency while also determining what responsibilities the new agency would have. For example, Ireland chose to place its new food safety agency in its existing Department of Health and Children, in part, to separate food safety responsibility from the promotion of the food industry, which is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food. On the other hand, to separate food safety regulation from political pressures, New Zealand established a semi-autonomous food safety agency. A second challenge, cited by officials in several countries, was helping employees assimilate into the new agency's culture and support its priorities. To foster the development of a common organizational culture, food agency officials in Denmark moved employees to centralized locations and held monthly meetings to familiarize them with the mission and culture of the organization. Although none of the countries has formally analyzed its consolidation results, the government officials and stakeholders we interviewed in each of the seven countries stated that the overall effect of consolidation has been or will likely be positive. None of the countries has conducted an analysis to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system with that of the previous system. For example, officials stated they could not determine whether their country's consolidation had reduced foodborne illness because consolidation was only one of many factors that could influence the frequency of foodborne illness. Furthermore, it may be too early to fully assess the benefits of consolidation for several of the countries because their new food safety structures have been functioning for 3 years or less. Although limited, some information on costs and benefits was available. As expected, most countries incurred start-up costs in reorganizing. These expenditures were used for purposes such as acquiring buildings and purchasing laboratory equipment. Some countries experienced a temporary reduction in the quantity of food safety activities performed due to consolidation-related disruptions. However, government officials in each of the seven countries believe that these consolidation costs have been or will likely be exceeded by the benefits. Specifically, these officials, as well as stakeholders in each country, consistently stated that consolidation of their food safety systems has led to significant qualitative improvements in food safety operations that enhance effectiveness or efficiency. For example, government officials and stakeholders cited such benefits as reduced overlap in inspections, more targeted inspections based on food safety risk, more consistent or timely enforcement of food safety laws and regulations, and greater clarity in responsibilities. Government officials in Canada, the Netherlands, and Denmark stated that some cost savings may be achieved as a result of changes that have already taken place or are expected from planned changes needed to complete their consolidation efforts. For example, in the Netherlands officials said that reduced duplication in food safety inspections would likely result in decreased food safety spending. Dutch officials also said that they anticipate savings to be derived from an expected 25 percent reduction in administrative and management personnel and from selling excess property. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS and USDA stated that they are working together effectively to ensure food safety and pointed out limitations related to the information available for our study. For example, both agencies said the report does not contain cost-benefit analyses of countries' consolidations, and USDA said the report does not have information on causal relationships between consolidation and quantifiable public health benefits, such as changes in the incidence of foodborne illness. They also said that these countries' consolidation experiences have or may have limited applicability to the U.S. food safety system because the countries have smaller food and agriculture industries than the United States. Our report clearly acknowledges that the countries provided limited quantitative data on the costs and benefits of consolidation and points out that the information presented is based on structured interviews with highlevel officials, documentation they provided, and interviews with food industry or consumer stakeholders from each of the seven countries we reviewed. As our report states, government officials, as well as food industry and consumer stakeholders, consistently stated that consolidation of their food safety systems has led to significant improvements in food safety operations that enhance effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, our report clearly states that the countries we reviewed are smaller than the United States, but it also notes that, similar to the United States, they are high-income countries where consumers have high expectations for food safety. Consequently, we believe this report provides useful information on countries' experiences, particularly with regard to the qualitative improvements in food safety operations cited by government officials. Background While the U.S. food supply is generally safe, each year, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate, tens of millions of Americans become ill and thousands die from eating unsafe food. Furthermore, USDA's Economic Research Service has estimated that the costs associated with foodborne illnesses are about $7 billion, including medical costs and productivity losses from missed work. The safety and quality of the U.S. food supply is governed by a complex system that is administered by 15 agencies. The principal federal agencies with food safety responsibilities operate under numerous statutes underpinning the federal framework for ensuring the safety and quality of the food supply in the United States. These laws give the agencies different regulatory and enforcement authorities, and about 70 interagency agreements aim to coordinate the combined food safety oversight responsibilities of the various agencies. The federal system is supplemented by the states, which have their own statutes, regulations, and agencies for regulating and inspecting the safety and quality of food products. USDA and FDA have primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of foods. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service regulates meat, poultry, and certain egg products, and FDA regulates the safety of all other foods, including milk, seafood, and fruits and vegetables. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on the amount of pesticide residues that are allowed in food, and the National Marine Fisheries Service within the Department of Commerce provides fee-for-service inspections to ensure the safety and/or quality of commercial seafood. Similarly, USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) performs food quality assurance inspections that include food safety elements. In addition to their established food safety responsibilities, USDA, FDA, and EPA, along with the Department of Homeland Security, have begun to address food security.6 Figure 1 summarizes the 15 agencies and their food safety responsibilities. 6For the purposes of this report, we defined food security as distinct from food safety in that food security refers to the vulnerability of a nation's food supply to deliberate actions that contaminate food or reduce the available quantity of food.

However, AMS performs some functions related to food safety for several foods. For example, AMS graders monitor a shell egg surveillance program that identifies cracked and dirty eggs. In addition, AMS performs functions related to food safety for the National School Lunch Program. bIn 2001, by Executive Order, the President stated that the then Office of Homeland Security, as part of its efforts to protect critical infrastructures, should coordinate efforts to protect livestock, agriculture, and food systems from terrorist attack. In 2002, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002), setting out the department's responsibility to protect and secure critical infrastructures and transferring several food safety related responsibilities to the Department of Homeland Security. As a result of the Executive Order, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 establishing the Department of Homeland Security, and subsequent Presidential Directives, the Department of Homeland Security provides overall direction on how to protect the U.S. food supply from deliberate contamination. Many proposals have been made to consolidate the U.S. food safety system, but to date no action has been taken. Several bills introduced in the Congress, reports by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Commission on the Public Service, and several of our reports and testimonies have proposed consolidation of the U.S. food safety system. For example, in 2001, parallel Senate and House bills proposed consolidating inspections and other food safety responsibilities in a single independent agency. In 2004, legislation was again introduced in the Senate and the House to establish a single food safety agency to protect public health, ensure food safety, and improve research and food security. This proposed legislation would combine the two food safety regulatory programs of USDA and FDA, along with a voluntary seafood inspection program operated by the Department of Commerce. The proposed new food safety program would have been based on a comprehensive analysis of the hazards associated with different foods and their processing and would require, among other things, the enforcement of the adoption of process controls in food establishments as well as the establishment and enforcement of science-based standards. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences recommended integrating the U.S. food safety system and suggested several options, including a single food safety agency.7 More recently, the National Commission on the Public Service recommended that government programs that are designed to achieve similar outcomes be combined into one agency and that agencies with similar or related missions be combined into large departments.8 The Commission chairman testified before a House subcommittee that important health and safety protections fail when responsibility for 7Ensuring Safe Food From Production to Consumption, Institute of Medicine, National Research Council (Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1998). 8Urgent Business For America: Revitalizing the Federal Government For the 21st Century, Report of the National Commission on the Public Service (Washington, D.C., 2003). regulation is dispersed among several departments, as is the case with the U.S. food safety system. The division of responsibility among several government agencies responsible for food safety is not unique to the United States. Food safety officials in the countries we selected for this review said they faced similar divisions of responsibilities and that their countries' reorganizations were intended to address this problem. Although the seven countries whose food safety systems we reviewed are much smaller in population than the United States, they, like the United States, are high-income countries9 where consumers have very high expectations for food safety. Table 1 presents data on population, size of economy, food expenditures, and consumer spending for food as a percentage of total consumer spending for the seven countries and the United States. The table shows that U.S. consumers' spending on food as a percentage of their total spending is somewhat similar to that of the other seven countries, ranging from about 10 percent in the United States to over 16 percent in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In general, high-income countries tend to spend a smaller percentage of their income on food than low-income countries. For instance, in low-income countries consumers' spending for food often exceeds 50 percent of their total spending.10 9All seven countries, as well as the United States, are in the World Bank's high-income category. 10For all of the 114 countries analyzed in a recent USDA Economic Research Service study, consumer spending on food as a percentage of total spending ranged from nearly 74 percent of the total budget in Azerbaijan to just below 10 percent in the United States.

Most of the countries we selected for this review are members of the EU11 and, as such, must abide by EU food safety legislation. The development and implementation of EU food safety legislation is the responsibility of the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General. In 2002, to respond to consumer concerns about the safety of the food supply, the EU created a 11The EU is a treaty-based institutional framework that defines and manages economic and political cooperation among its 25 member countries. EU member countries have reached EU-wide agreement in certain policy areas, including food safety, and operate as a single economic market. new independent food safety institution, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which is responsible for providing independent, scientific advice on all matters linked to food and animal feed safety. The tasks performed by EFSA include communicating with the public on food safety matters and providing risk assessments to the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the EU Member States. In addition to creating EFSA in April 2004, the EU adopted additional, comprehensive food safety legislation12 that becomes effective, in large part, on January 1, 2006. Together with the earlier regulation establishing EFSA, the legislation is intended to create a single, transparent set of EU food safety rules applicable to all food, including animal and nonanimal products. The legislation covers the entire food supply chain from production to consumption and places more requirements on EU member nations. It identifies specific food safety objectives and, unlike much of the EU's previous food safety legislation, specifies the methods by which those objectives must be achieved. For example, it requires food business operators to adopt specific hygiene measures and a permanent procedure or procedures based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point principles.13 Moreover, the legislation requires that each EU country establish and implement an official food and animal feed control plan by January 1, 2007. Thereafter, an annual report on the implementation of this national control plan must be submitted. To carry out its official controls over food and animal feed, a country must designate responsible entities. If a country has more than one responsible entity, it must ensure effective coordination between these entities. According to a paper presented at a 12According to EU officials, the legislative package includes Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs; Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law and animal health and animal welfare rules; Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin; Regulation (EC) No. 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organization of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption; and Directive 2004/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 repealing certain directives concerning food hygiene and health conditions for the production and placing on the market of certain products of animal origin intended for human consumption and amending Council Directives 89/662/EEC and 92/118/EEC and Council Decision 95/408/EC. 13Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point principles are risk-based and make industry, rather than government inspectors, responsible for identifying steps in food production where food safety hazards are most likely to occur and for establishing controls that prevent or reduce such hazards. 2004 international forum for food safety regulators, in recent years many EU countries have chosen to establish a national food safety authority, but the establishment of such an authority is not obligatory.14 Countries Have Taken Various Consolidation Approaches, and Officials and Stakeholders Cited Challenges and Costs but Believe Food Safety Systems Are Now More Effective The seven countries we examined had two primary reasons for reorganizing and consolidating their food safety systems, took various approaches, and often faced similar challenges. While the extent to which countries consolidated their food safety systems varied considerably, each country established a single agency to lead food safety management or enforcement of food safety legislation.15 Although most countries incurred some consolidation start-up costs, government officials, as well as food industry and consumer stakeholders, generally agree that consolidation has led to significant qualitative improvements in the effectiveness or efficiency of their food safety systems. Our ability to evaluate these improvements and other information officials provided was limited because none of the countries has conducted an analysis to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system relative to that of the previous system. In some cases, it may be too early to fully assess the benefits of the countries' consolidations. The seven countries whose reorganizations we reviewed consolidated their food safety systems primarily to improve program effectiveness and efficiency or to respond to public concern about food safety. 14\"European Food Safety Control Systems: New Perspectives on a Harmonized Legal Basis\" (paper presented at the Second Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization Global Forum for Food Safety Regulators, October 2004). 15The Netherlands established a lead agency to enforce food safety legislation. The other six countries established a lead agency for risk management. Risk management is the process, distinct from risk assessment, of weighing policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties, considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the health protection of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices, and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options. However, some countries, such as Germany, have separated responsibility for risk assessment-the scientifically based process consisting of hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization-from risk management by placing risk management and risk assessment responsibilities in separate entities. According to a 1998 National Research Council report,16 an effective food safety system protects and improves the public health by ensuring that foods meet science-based safety standards through the integrated activities of the public and private sectors. This report also addresses efficiency, stating the greatest strides in ensuring food safety from production to consumption can be made through a scientific risk-based system that ensures that surveillance, regulatory, and research resources are allocated to maximize effectiveness. Public concern about food safety became an important issue in several industrialized countries during the 1990s when bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, was confirmed in large numbers of cattle.17 In addition to improving effectiveness and efficiency and responding to public concern about food safety, some EU countries were further prompted to consolidate by the need to comply with recently approved EU food safety legislation that becomes effective, in large part, January 1, 2006. The new legislation places more requirements on EU member countries. For example, each EU member country will be required to submit and annually update a plan for the implementation of the new law and to report annually on the implementation of that plan. Regarding consolidation approaches, each country established a single agency to lead food safety management or enforcement of food safety legislation. Each country modified its existing legal framework to give legal authority and responsibility to the new food safety agency. However, countries' approaches in consolidating their food safety systems varied, particularly with respect to how comprehensively food safety functions were consolidated. For example, Denmark centralized its system by creating a new federal agency in which it consolidated almost all its food safety functions and activities, including food inspections, which were previously distributed among several federal and local government agencies. On the other hand, in Germany, which established a new lead food safety agency, the 16 federal states continue to be responsible for oversight of food inspections performed by local governments. Germany's 16Ensuring Safe Food From Production to Consumption, National Research Council (Washington, D.C.: 1998). 17BSE is an always fatal, neurodegenerative disease that has been found in cattle in numerous countries. Cattle contract the disease through animal feed that contains protein derived from the remains of diseased animals. Scientists generally believe an equally fatal disease in humans-known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD)-is linked to eating beef from cattle infected with BSE. new food safety agency functions as a coordinating body to lead food safety management, including formulation of general administrative rules to guide the federal states' implementation of national food safety laws. In reorganizing their food safety systems, officials from several countries cited challenges in two areas. First, many countries faced a similar decision regarding whether to place the new agency within the existing health or agriculture ministry or establish it as a stand-alone agency while also determining what responsibilities the new agency would have. A second challenge, cited by officials in several countries, was helping employees assimilate into the new agency's culture and support its priorities. Although countries have not formally analyzed consolidation results, the government officials and stakeholders we interviewed in each of the seven countries cited improvements in food safety system operations and stated that the net effect of consolidation has been or will likely be positive. None of the countries has conducted an analysis to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system relative to that of the previous system. For example, officials stated that they could not determine whether their country's consolidation had resulted in public health benefits, such as reduced foodborne illness, because consolidation was only one of many factors that could affect the frequency of foodborne illness. Furthermore, it may be too early to fully assess the benefits of consolidation for several of the countries, as their countries' new food safety structures have been functioning for 3 years or less. Although limited, some information on costs and benefits was available. As expected, most countries incurred start-up costs, which included, for example, the acquisition of buildings and purchases of laboratory equipment. Some countries experienced a temporary reduction in the quantity of food safety activities performed due to consolidation-related disruptions. However, government officials in each of the seven countries believe the benefits of their consolidations have exceeded or will likely exceed the costs. In particular, these officials, as well as food industry and consumer stakeholders in each country, consistently stated that consolidation of their food safety systems has led to significant qualitative improvements in food safety operations that enhance effectiveness or efficiency. These improvements include the reduction of overlapping food safety activities, such as inspections of food establishments by various agencies. (Figure 2 summarizes each country's improvements in food safety operations as cited by government officials, food industry stakeholders, or consumer stakeholders.) Moreover, government officials in Canada, the Netherlands, and Denmark stated that some cost savings may be achieved as a result of changes that have already taken place or are expected from planned changes needed to complete their consolidation efforts.

Note: The improvements listed are based on structured interviews with food safety officials and food industry and consumer stakeholders. Figures 3 through 9 show summary information on each country's reasons for consolidation, entities responsible for food safety before and after consolidation, challenges, and start-up18 and other consolidation-related costs, as well as examples of consolidation benefits. This information was provided by government officials and food industry or consumer stakeholders. For more detailed information on each country, see appendixes II through VIII. 18In consolidating their food safety systems, six of the seven countries incurred start-up costs in addition to ongoing operational costs. In these countries, the newly created consolidated food safety agencies needed additional funding to establish a fully operational food safety system. Although some countries provided documentation regarding these startup costs, we were not able to determine the reliability of this information.

Entities In 1997, Canada reorganized its food safety system. Inspections: Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), a separate responsible for regulatory agency (departmental corporation) whose president reports directly to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri food safety after Food Canada. Public health policy and standard setting: Health Canada. consolidation Responsibilities of CFIA: All inspection/compliance activities, including inspections of imported/domestic products, laboratory and diagnostic food safety support, crisis management and product recalls, and export certification.a Health Canada: Public health policy and standard agency(ies) after setting, including research, risk assessment, and setting limits on the amount of a substance allowed in a food product.b consolidation Challenges (1) Assignment of specific food safety roles and responsibilities: To address this challenge, the CFIA and Health Canada jointly developed a food safety functions matrix to clearly define responsibilities. (2) Assimilating employees into a new agency's culture and priorities and a high retirement rate among former employees of the health, agriculture, and fisheries departments: Officials said it is important to plan for the merging of organizational cultures and bring the workforce into a dialogue on the new organization's vision and objectives. Start-up and other (1) According to Canadian officials, in fiscal year 1998 Canada spent $25 million Canadian ($18 million U.S.) in start-up consolidation-funds to consolidate food safety inspections within the CFIA. This amount was about 7 percent of the agency's fiscal year related costs cited 1998 budget. by officials and (2) According to labor officials, productivity briefly declined shortly before and immediately after consolidation. In addition, stakeholders according to government officials, retirements resulted in a temporary loss of experience. Examples of (1) Financial savings: A senior CFIA official stated that during the agency's first 2 years, fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year benefits cited by 1998, the consolidation reduced food safety operating expenditures 10 percent relative to preconsolidation food safety officials and spending. Noting that no comprehensive analysis has been performed to determine the net impact of the consolidation stakeholders on food safety expenditures, the official based this statement on his knowledge of food safety operating expenditures before and after consolidation. (2) Reduced overlap in inspections: Inspectors have been trained to perform more than one type of food safety inspection. This cross-utilization of inspectors enables one inspector to complete inspections of a food-processing facility that were previously performed by two or more inspectors. As a result, the number of visits made to the same food-processing facility has been reduced. (3) Clearer responsibilities, better coordination, and reduced gaps in oversight: Officials said consolidation has clarified food safety responsibilities, and, as a result, the food safety system's ability to mitigate risk and to respond to a potential crisis has improved. They cited the response to managing the 2003 BSE crisis as an effective reaction to a problem, stating that food safety personnel knew their specific responsibilities and responded in a timely, thorough manner. Officials said the effectiveness of this response can, in part, be attributed to the universal coordination of animal health and food safety that has resulted from the consolidation.c Source: GAO analysis of information from Canadian officials and stakeholders. aThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency is also responsible for food quality assurance inspections and animal and plant disease control. bHealth Canada's responsibilities include research, risk assessment and standard setting in relation to the nutritional quality of foods marketed in Canada. cAn international review supported this assessment, stating the investigation was comprehensive, thorough, and timely. In addition, food industry stakeholders said the government's response to BSE was very effective.

Entities Inspections: (1) Ministry of Agriculture; (2) Ministry of Fisheries; and (3) municipalities. responsible for food safety before Standard setting: (1) Ministry of Health; (2) Ministry of Agriculture; and (3) Ministry of Fisheries. consolidation Entities In 1997, the Danish government created the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) as an agency of the responsible for Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. Inspections were consolidated within DVFA in 1999 and 2000. The food safety after organization was fully in place by January 2000. In an August 2004 governmental reorganization, DVFA was moved to the consolidation Ministry of Family and Consumer Affairs. Responsibilities of The DVFA is responsible for almost all food safety responsibilities. Exceptions are the Plant Directorate, which is food safety responsible for animal feed inspections, and the Directorate for Fisheries, which is responsible for inspection of fish on agency(ies) after ships. These two agencies are in the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. consolidation Challenges (1) Municipal inspectors, who were accustomed to being part of much smaller systems, were transferred into the DVFA. To foster the development of a common culture and reinforce the new agency's mission, DVFA moved employees to centralized locations and held monthly meetings. (2) Having adequate funding for start-up costs, which were originally underestimated. Start-up and other (1) According to officials, start-up costs associated with Denmark's consolidation were about 204.5 million Danish kroner consolidation-(about $26 million U.S.), or approximately 21 percent of DVFA's fiscal year 2000 budget. The start-up funds were spent related costs cited for new data processing systems, laboratory equipment, staff compensation, and buildings. by officials and (2) Officials said the number of inspections performed declined from 1999 to 2000 while DVFA was being formed, but began stakeholders to increase after 2000. Examples of benefits cited by officials and stakeholders (1) Reduced overlap in inspections: Inspectors have been trained to perform more than one type of food safety inspection. This cross-utilization of inspectors enables one inspector to complete the inspection of a single food processing facility, which previously might have been performed by two or more inspectors, and reduces the number of visits made to the same food processing facility. (2) Frequency of inspections based on risk: Officials stated consolidation and accompanying reform of food safety laws facilitated risk-based inspections. The frequency of most inspections is now based on an individual food product's safety risk and on an individual company's food safety record, not on agencies' jurisdiction, as was the case before consolidation. As a result, the frequency of inspections at some food processing plants and of lower risk food products has been reduced, making more resources available for inspections of higher risk companies and foods. (3) More consistent or timely enforcement of food safety laws and regulations: Reducing inconsistency in inspections resulting from the sharing of food safety responsibilities among three ministries and local authorities was one of the chief reasons Denmark decided to consolidate its food safety system. According to officials, moving nearly all food inspection responsibilities to the DVFA, establishing uniform guidelines, and training inspectors greatly reduced these inconsistencies in enforcement. Officials added that they expect this increased consistency in inspections will make it easier for them to comply with new EU food safety legislation. (4) Possible financial savings: Officials said consolidation enabled a reduction in the number of microbiological laboratories from 11 to 6. As a result, they estimate the annual operating costs of microbiological laboratories have been reduced considerably. In addition, a senior official stated that consolidation of regional and local offices has reduced administrative expenses. Source: GAO analysis of information from Danish officials and stakeholders.

In 2002, Germany responsible for established a coordinating body, the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, to lead food safety food safety after management. In addition, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment was established in 2002 to separate scientific risk consolidation assessments from decision making.

Challenges According to officials, negotiations between the federal government and the federal states concerning reform of food safety law have been complicated, as some reforms that would give the federal government increased authority would require constitutional changes, according to officials. Start-up and other Germany's consolidation did not require significant start-up spending. consolidation related costs cited by officials and stakeholders Examples of benefits cited by officials and stakeholders Streamlined communications and improved crisis management: Officials said that the consolidation has resulted in enhanced communication between the federal government and the federal states, as well as providing more complete food safety information to consumers. As an example, they cited the response of the Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food, and Agriculture and its two new agencies to the emergence of acrylamidea in food as a major public concern. In responding to the acrylamide issue, the federal government established a food risk forum to enable state food safety agencies, the food industry, and consumer organizations to more easily communicate with each other. In addition, acrylamide questions and answers were put on the Internet to address consumer concerns. According to officials, before the consolidation, coordinated communication happened only sporadically, and at times the federal agencies and the federal states disseminated conflicting information. Officials believe these streamlined communications are beginning to restore consumers' confidence in the food safety system. A consumer organization representative agreed that the consolidation had improved communication during food crises.

Thirty-three local authorities. consolidation According to officials, these entities' activities were not coordinated and, no independent accountability system existed to provide assurance of enforcement of food safety laws. Entities (1) Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). In 1998, to coordinate and oversee the activities of the existing food safety responsible for entities, Ireland established the FSAI. FSAI is an independent food safety agency that reports to the Minister of Health food safety after and Children. (Ministries, health boards, and local authorities continue to perform inspections.) consolidation Responsibilities of The FSAI has risk assessment, management, and communication responsibilities. In addition, it is responsible for the food safety enforcement of food safety legislation. It carries out this responsibility by establishing and overseeing service contracts with agency(ies) after some of the previous food safety entities. Under these contracts, the previous food safety entities continue to perform consolidation functions such as inspections. Challenges (1) In deciding where to place the new agency, FSAI, within the government, Ireland chose to place the agency under its existing Ministry of Health and Children specifically to separate food safety responsibilities from food and agriculture promotion efforts, which is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food. (2) FSAI also had to bring about the clear understanding that the food industry has the primary responsibility for food safety. Start-up and other Officials stated Ireland spent approximately 1.5 million Irish pounds ($2 million U.S.) for start-up costs in fiscal year 1999.a consolidation-The start-up funds were used for temporary staff, renting office space, and operational expenses. related costs cited by officials and stakeholders Examples of benefits cited by officials and stakeholders (1) Single contact for consumer and industry clients: Officials cited improved relations with stakeholders as a result of providing consumers with a single agency contact and forming a council group that encompassed both industry and consumers to discuss the concerns faced by each group. According to the officials, this level of communication between the government, industry, and consumers had not existed prior to the consolidation when no single agency had food safety as its central mission. (2) Improved accountability and transparency: According to officials, the establishment of Ireland's lead food safety agency, the FSAI, has made the many entities that have food safety responsibilities more accountable for the performance of those responsibilities. Before consolidation, food safety functions, most notably inspections, were the responsibility of over 50 entities across the government with no central government authority to coordinate or monitor the performance of these entities. Consolidation made the FSAI responsible for enforcing food safety legislation and tracking the many entities' food safety activities. FSAI uses service contracts with each of the government departments, local authorities, and regional health boards to reach agreement with the entities on performance standards, including methods of inspection and the number of inspections to be conducted. FSAI officials meet formally at least three times a year with each entity's liaison to facilitate monitoring of the service contracts. Separate audits are conducted to verify compliance with their contract requirements.

In 2003, the new agency food safety after was moved to the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. The new agency includes both inspection offices, consolidation which are to be consolidated by January 1, 2006. Responsibilities of According to officials, the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority's core responsibilities cover three areas: (1) risk food safety assessment and research - to identify and analyze potential threats to the safety of food and consumer products; (2) agency(ies) after enforcement - to ensure compliance with legislation for meat, food, and consumer products, which may include non-food consolidation items; and (3) risk communication - to provide information concerning risk and risk reduction, based on accurate and reliable data. Challenges (1) Determining the responsibilities and authorities the new food safety agency would have and the ministry in which to place the new agency. (2) Increased employee attrition. Start-up and other Officials estimate the Netherlands' Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority will spend approximately 5 million euros ($6 consolidation-million U.S.) on its ongoing consolidation process, or about 3 percent of its 2004 budget. related costs cited by officials and stakeholders Examples of benefits cited by officials and stakeholders (1) Reduced overlap in inspections: Before the consolidation, two inspection offices from separate ministries had responsibility for inspecting slaughterhouses. After consolidation, both inspection offices were placed under the new food safety agency, and now only one inspection office inspects slaughterhouses. In addition, inspectors are being trained to perform more than one type of food safety inspection. This cross-utilization of inspectors will enable one inspector to complete the inspection of a single food-processing facility which was previously conducted by two or more inspectors and reduce the number of visits made to the same food-processing facility. (2) Possible financial savings: Officials anticipate consolidation of inspectionsa will result in financial savings derived from an expected 25 percent reduction in administrative and management personnel and from selling excess property. The Netherlands has also begun to cross-utilize inspectors, training them to perform more than one type of inspection, and has eliminated duplication of food safety inspections by placing its two inspection offices under one agency. Together, these changes are expected to reduce food safety expenditures. A senior Dutch official stated that having one agency be responsible for the entire food supply chain will result in potential savings. (3) Single contact for consumer and industry clients: Industry stakeholders said that before the creation of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, it was unclear to consumers which agency had responsibility for various food safety activities, stakeholders said it is now very clear that the new agency has responsibility for all food safety functions.

(2) Adjustment to new organizational culture: Officials stated that reassigning employees to the new food safety agency was moderately challenging because some employees from the larger organizations, particularly those from the Ministry of Health, had difficulty assimilating into the culture of the new agency. Approximately 100 employees moved from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and 12 staff moved from the Ministry of Health into the new food safety agency. Start-up and other New Zealand officials stated that during 2002 New Zealand spent about $2 million New Zealand (about $1 million U.S.) on consolidation-consolidation start-up costs.b The start-up funds were primarily used for moving expenses, development of new related costs cited communication and branding materials, temporary personnel, and rented office space. by officials and stakeholders Examples of Streamlined communication: According to industry stakeholders, the consolidation has increased and streamlined benefits cited by communication between the food industry and the new food safety agency. They said that before the creation of NZFSA, such officials and communication was not as good as it could have been because two ministries had food safety responsibilities, neither placed stakeholders food safety as a top priority, and coordination between the two ministries was weak. As a result of the increased and streamlined communication offered by the consolidated food safety system, stakeholders said that the new food safety agency is more responsive to food safety crises. They said the new agency established a network that quickly delivers information to notify the public of food safety issues. This increased interaction has made industry more confident in how the government handles food safety matters. New Zealand's consumer stakeholders told us that streamlined communication is a result of the consolidation and added that this improved communication has improved consumer confidence.

Officials stated that stakeholders before the establishment of FSA, no criteria existed for how local food safety inspections were to be performed, and there was no requirement to report the results of those inspections to the central government. Inspection records were kept at the local level. FSA has authority to audit food safety inspections conducted by local entities, and these entities must provide FSA with statistical information on their food safety inspections. According to officials, this information is made available to the public on a quarterly basis.

Concluding Observations Although different in many respects, the seven countries' experiences provide information on the reform and consolidation of food safety systems that can be useful to U.S. policymakers. While the seven countries had to overcome challenges, their experiences show that reforming and streamlining food safety systems is possible when a consensus exists among government agencies, the food industry, and consumer organizations. As we learned from food safety officials and industry and consumer stakeholders in each country we reviewed, such reforms may result in benefits such as reducing overlaps in food safety inspections and basing the frequency of inspections on the risks posed by specific products. We have reported in the past that the federal food safety system in the United States could benefit from statutory and organizational reforms. As Congress and other policymakers consider the advantages and disadvantages of streamlining multiple existing food safety statutes into a uniform and risk-based framework and whether to consolidate federal food safety functions under a single agency, these countries' lessons may offer useful information. Comments from the We provided relevant excerpts from a draft of this report to officials of food safety agencies in Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands,Seven Countries New Zealand, and the United Kingdom for their review. The officials either Examined replied that they had no technical comments or provided technical corrections, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. Agency Comments and Our Evaluation Although this report does not evaluate HHS's or USDA's food safety programs and, therefore, makes no recommendations to the agencies, we provided a draft copy to HHS and USDA for review and comment. In commenting on this report, both HHS and USDA stated that U.S. food safety agencies are working together effectively. HHS noted that our report provides limited quantitative data on the results of each country's consolidation. The report clearly states that the information presented was obtained primarily through structured interviews with high-level government officials and food industry and consumer stakeholders from each of the seven countries we reviewed. In addition, our report acknowledges that these officials provided limited quantitative data; when it was provided to us, we included it in the report. Our report also acknowledges that none of the countries has conducted a formal analysis to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system with that of the previous system. HHS also commented that the countries included in our report have smaller food and agriculture industries than the United States. We agree, and our report highlights such differences in table 1, which shows that the seven countries have smaller economies and less total food consumption than the United States. Our report also points out, however, that these countries are similar to the United States in that they are high-income countries where consumers have high expectations for food safety. Finally, HHS commented that the report does not identify the agencies that are responsible for foodborne illness surveillance in each of the countries we reviewed. We have added a footnote to indicate that the report does not contain that information. HHS also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated in the report as appropriate. HHS's comments are presented in appendix IX. In its comments, USDA stated that the report does not contain rigorous cost-benefit analyses or quantitative data on the public health effects of the countries' consolidations, such as changes in foodborne illness rates. Our report clearly acknowledges that we obtained limited quantitative information and that none of the countries has conducted an analysis to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system with that of the previous system. Specifically, with regard to the effect of consolidation on public health benefits, the report states that officials told us they could not determine whether their country's consolidation had reduced foodborne illness because consolidation was one of many factors that could influence the frequency of foodborne illness. USDA also stated that the report does not contain quantitative data on reorganization costs. This statement is incorrect. All but one of the seven countries provided information on the costs of reorganization, which the report presents in figures 3 through 9. Similar to HHS, USDA commented that the countries we reviewed have much smaller populations and also differ from the United States in climate and agricultural production. Our report identifies differences of this type in table 1. The report points out, however, that these countries and the United States have at least one important similarity: they are high-income countries where consumers have high expectations for food safety. As a result, we believe the consolidation experiences of the countries reviewed have applicability to the United States. USDA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. USDA's comments are included in appendix X. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services, and other interested parties. We will also make copies available to others upon request. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

Robinson Managing Director, Natural Resources and Environment Appendix I Scope and Methodology This report describes the approaches the seven countries have taken in consolidating food safety functions, the challenges they faced, and the results of the countries' efforts, including benefits and costs cited by government officials and industry or consumer stakeholders. For the purposes of this report, we defined consolidation as the transfer of responsibility and resources for performing a food safety function from two or more agencies to a single agency. To identify countries that have consolidated their food safety systems, we interviewed USDA and FDA officials, reviewed a 2001World Health Organization report on how countries have organized their food safety systems,1 and reviewed the Internet sites of countries' food safety agencies. We selected a judgmental sample of seven countries for our review based on the following criteria: USDA and FDA officials agreed that these countries have consolidated, the countries have high per capita income, and the countries have consolidated functions of their food safety system within the last 10 years. To address our objective, we examined the seven countries' efforts to streamline and consolidate their food safety systems, including the benefits and costs that resulted, as cited by government officials. We conducted structured interviews with senior government officials from food safety agencies and with representatives of food industry or consumer organizations in each country, reviewed and analyzed the documents they provided, and reviewed World Health Organization and GAO reports. We also met with European Union (EU) food safety officials to discuss how the EU's food legislation is affecting its member countries' decisions to consolidate, as well as how the EU interacts with food safety agencies in member countries. The information on countries' food safety systems in this report, including descriptions of laws,2 is based almost exclusively on interviews with and documentation provided by high-level food safety officials as well as food industry or consumer stakeholders from the seven countries we examined. 1World Health Organization, Improved Coordination and Harmonization of National Food Safety Control Services (World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2001). 2We did not perform independent analysis of those laws or attempt to independently assess their intent. Appendix I Scope and Methodology Most of the information we obtained was qualitative. To the extent possible, we corroborated the qualitative information provided by government officials by interviewing food industry and consumer organization stakeholders. We obtained very limited quantitative information. We asked government officials questions intended to help us assess the reliability of the quantitative information they provided, but we could not determine the reliability of most of this information because of constraints on the amount of time the countries' food safety officials could devote to our study. Although we could not assess the quantitative information's reliability, we are reporting it in order to provide descriptive information to inform policymakers in the United States about the various approaches, challenges, and benefits that countries' officials identified to us regarding their consolidation efforts. The data in table 2 on selected countries' population, gross domestic product, food consumption, income, and consumer spending were used for background purposes and were not verified. We conducted our work from April 2004 through December 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix II Canada's Food Safety System Consolidation In 1997, Canada consolidated its food inspection activities with the creation of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Food safety standard setting, research, and risk assessment were consolidated within Health Canada. Reasons for Consolidating Canada consolidated its food safety system to (1) improve effectiveness by Food Safety Responsibilities making inspections and enforcement more consistent, clarifying responsibilities, and enhancing reporting to the Canadian parliament, (2) improve efficiency by reducing duplication and overlap in food safety activities, and (3) reduce federal spending. Responsibilities and Structure Before and After Consolidation Before Canada consolidated its food safety system, its food safety inspection, food policy, and risk assessment responsibilities were shared by three separate entities-Health Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. In 1997, the Canadian parliament approved the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Act. All food safety inspection activities were assigned to CFIA, a separate regulatory agency whose president reports to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. CFIA is responsible for all food safety inspections and related activities, including inspections of imported and domestic products, export certifications, laboratory and diagnostic support, crisis management, and product recalls. CFIA is also responsible for food quality assurance inspections and animal health and plant disease control. Canada has adopted a comprehensive farm-to-table approach to food safety responsibilities. Public health policy and standard-setting responsibilities including research, risk assessment, and setting limits on the amount of a substance allowed in a food product, were consolidated within Health Canada.1 With the placement of food safety inspections and related activities in CFIA and risk assessment in Health Canada, inspection responsibilities were separated from risk assessment to allow for an independent scientific risk assessment process. 1Health Canada's responsibilities include research, risk assessment and standard setting in relation to the nutritional quality of foods marketed in Canada. For example, Health Canada is responsible for nutrition labeling, health claims, and nutrient content claims. Appendix II Canada's Food Safety System Consolidation Legislation In 1997, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act created the agency and gave it authority to implement existing food safety laws. Additional legislative reform intended to increase the food safety system's effectiveness and efficiency beyond the gains already achieved was introduced in the Canadian parliament in November 2004.2 According to CFIA, under this proposed legislation, the authorities for CFIA inspectors contained in eight commodity-specific laws would be strengthened and made consistent. In addition, the law would give CFIA additional inspection and enforcement authorities to protect the food supply, such as the authority to hold products while awaiting test results. Challenges CFIA faced a challenge in helping staff adjust to a new organization as its work force combined former employees from the health, agriculture, and fisheries departments. According to officials, several senior officials retired when CFIA was being formed. As a result, the agency temporarily had less experience at the management level than would have been optimal. Canadian officials told us it is important to plan for the merging of organizational cultures and to bring the new work force into a dialogue on the new organization's vision and objectives. Employee unions were initially concerned that the consolidation would lead to privatization of the food safety work force. According to a CFIA official, these concerns decreased substantially when the work force realized privatization was not planned. In addition, the official stated that labor relations have improved because unions now only have to interact with one food safety inspection agency instead of three. In addition, assignment of responsibilities was a major obstacle during the implementation phase of Canada's consolidation. To address this challenge, Health Canada and CFIA jointly developed a food safety functions matrix to clearly define responsibilities. Annual Expenditures and According to a senior official, CFIA's fiscal year 2003 food safety spending Number of Employees was $360 million Canadian ($232 million U.S.). Spending for all of its activities-food safety, animal health, and plant protection-was $517 2The CFIA Enforcement Act was introduced in the Canadian Parliament on November 26, 2004. Appendix II Canada's Food Safety System Consolidation million Canadian ($334 million U.S.). User fees assessed on food establishments financed a portion of this spending. These user fees for food inspections have been frozen at about $40 million Canadian (about $26 million U.S.) since 1997 and in fiscal year 2003 accounted for about 11 percent of CFIA's food safety spending. According to a Health Canada official, the fiscal year 2004 budget for Health Canada's food program was about $42 million Canadian ($31 million U.S.). Reducing spending was one of Canada's objectives in consolidating its food safety system. A senior CFIA official stated that during the agency's first two years, fiscal years 1997 and 1998, the consolidation reduced food safety operating expenditures by 10 percent relative to preconsolidation food safety spending.3 The official based this statement on his knowledge of food safety operating expenditures before and after the consolidation. The official noted that Canada has not performed an analysis on the effect of its consolidation on food safety expenditures. According to the official, such an analysis would be difficult because (1) the last audited preconsolidation quantification of food safety expenditures was published in a 1994 report by Canada's Office of the Auditor General and (2) in fiscal year 1997, when the CFIA was formed, food safety, animal health, and plant health expenditures were not separated in financial reports. The agency began separating these expenditures in financial reports beginning in fiscal year 2000. According to the CFIA official, CFIA's work force consisted of about 5,300 employees in fiscal year 2003. According to a Health Canada official, the Health Canada food program had approximately 400 staff in fiscal year 2004. 3The official also noted that since fiscal year 1998,CFIA's total expenditures for all of its activities-food safety, animal health, and plant protection-have increased, but said this increased spending was not related to the consolidation and attributed the increase to higher food production, exports, and consumption, as well as increased spending in response to threats from new animal and plant diseases and pests. While some of these new plant pests and animal diseases, such as BSE, are food safety issues, others, such as footand-mouth disease, an animal disease, and the Asian long-horned beetle, an insect that harms trees, are not related to food safety. Appendix II Canada's Food Safety System Consolidation Stakeholder Reaction The food industry stakeholders we interviewed were consistently supportive of Canada's consolidation. Among the consolidation-related benefits they cited were improved communications, particularly with respect to food recalls; easier interaction with regulators through having a single contact for enforcement and compliance; fewer inspectors visiting processing plants; clarification of responsibilities; and increased consistency in the enforcement of food safety laws. While expressing overall support for the consolidation, representatives of some food industry organizations cited a need for more timely decision making. For example, representatives of one organization said their member companies, which, they said, often have more technical expertise than the government authorities on specific matters, sometimes have to wait too long for a decision on a food safety question and lose commercial opportunities as a result. In addition, some industry representatives said Health Canada's setting of standards should better reflect CFIA's ability to enforce the standards. Appendix III Denmark's Food Safety System Consolidation In 1997, Denmark consolidated its food safety system with the creation of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. Reasons for Consolidating Denmark consolidated its food safety system to (1) improve effectiveness Food Safety Responsibilities in several areas, including communications with consumers and consistency of inspections and (2) improve efficiency in numerous ways, such as by moving resources to areas that present higher risks and reducing overlaps in responsibilities. Responsibilities and Structure Before and After Consolidation Before Denmark consolidated its food safety system, responsibilities for inspections were shared by multiple entities, including the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Fisheries, and a large number of municipalities. Standard-setting responsibilities were shared by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Fisheries. In 1997, the Danish government consolidated the multiple agencies' activities into the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA), an agency of the newly formed Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. Inspections were consolidated within the DVFA in 1999 and 2000. In August 2004, as part of a governmental reorganization, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration was moved to the newly created Ministry of Family and Consumer Affairs. The DVFA is responsible for almost all food safety responsibilities. For logistical reasons, a few duties were not moved to the new agency in 1999 and 2000. These remaining duties are with the Plant Directorate, which is responsible for animal feed inspections, and the Directorate for Fisheries, which is responsible for inspections of fish on ships. These two agencies are in the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries. According to officials, the DVFA has farm-to-table food safety responsibilities. Denmark has separated risk management and risk assessment. The Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research, a separate institute within the DVFA, is responsible for research and risk assessment. Legislation The Danish Food Act, adopted in 1998, reformed Danish food safety law by replacing seven existing food laws with this single law. The legislation Appendix III Denmark's Food Safety System Consolidation harmonizes the regulation of food of animal origin and other food, and, according to Danish officials, it is very similar to EU food legislation. Challenges Officials said when bringing employees from several agencies into a new organization, it is important to establish a common culture. The consolidation involved over 2,000 employees, including about 500 municipal inspectors who were moved to the DVFA. To foster the development of a common organizational culture, food agency officials moved employees to centralized locations and established online discussion groups to familiarize employees with the mission and culture of the organization. In addition, the division heads in the regional offices held monthly meetings with employees. Moreover, officials stressed the need to have adequate funding for start-up costs. Annual Budget and Number According to officials, DVFA's budget for 2004 was 856 million Danish of Employees kroner (about $142 million U.S.). About 61 percent of this planned spending was to be financed by user fees assessed on food establishments. User fees finance nearly all meat inspections. Officials stated that DVFA had about 2,000 employees (1,820 full-time equivalents) in 2004. Stakeholder Reaction The food industry and consumer organization representatives we interviewed told us their organizations supported the proposed consolidation and continue to support it. They stated that the consolidation has improved the food safety system's effectiveness. Improvements cited include more consistent enforcement of food safety regulations, reduced overlap in inspections, streamlined communications, clearer responsibilities, and improved service delivery as a result of having a single contact. For example, a food industry representative stated that having a single contact leaves no doubt about which authority to approach when a problem or question arises. In addition, the representative said Denmark's salmonella control program is an example of a situation where the Appendix III Denmark's Food Safety System Consolidation consolidation's clearer responsibilities have been beneficial.1 Without the consolidation, said the representative, this program probably would have experienced conflicts between the health and agriculture ministries and would not have been as successful. User fees are also an important consideration for the Danish food industry. As noted earlier, Danish food companies finance a significant portion of DVFA's spending through payment of user fees. According to industry officials, the payment of these fees motivated the food industry to support reforms in the Danish food safety system that would hold down inspection costs. According to a consumer organization representative, the consolidation made food safety inspections and enforcement of laws and regulations more consistent. Before the consolidation, the representative said, many municipal food safety entities had insufficient expertise and resources and the central government's oversight of municipal food safety entities was uneven. In addition, the representative stated that the consolidation had facilitated the development of DVFA's online system to report the results of inspections. The representative believes having access to inspection reports has contributed to Danish consumers' continued high confidence in the safety of their food. 1Salmonella bacteria, sometimes present in meat, are a source of foodborne illness in humans. Appendix IV Germany's Food Safety System Consolidation The German parliament approved the creation of the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in 2002. Reasons for Consolidating Germany consolidated its food safety system in response to public Food Safety Responsibilities concerns about food safety stemming from the discovery of BSE in 2000 and other food safety problems. An additional objective was improved compliance with EU food safety legislation. Responsibilities and Structure Before and After Consolidation Before Germany consolidated its food safety system, responsibilities for research, risk assessment, and "
