        "text": "The Risk Assessment Form was updated on March 24, 2023\n\nThe Risk Assessment Form is a tool to identify and assess potential risks that research partnerships may pose to Canada’s national security as outlined in the National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships and to develop effective mitigation measures.\n\nRisk Assessment Review Process\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nNational Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships Risk Assessment Form\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Risk Assessment Form is a tool to identify and assess potential risks that research partnerships may pose to Canada’s national security as outlined in the National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships and to develop effective mitigation measures.\n\nIn answering the Risk Assessment Form questions, you will provide information – to the best of your ability – that is specific to your proposed area of research and prospective research partner organizations. This information will be used to assess national security risks where the proposed research partnership could expose the research project to foreign interference, espionage or theft from foreign governments, militaries and other organizations, and also pose potential risks to the wider Canadian research enterprise.\n\nFor the purpose of the National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships, a partner organization is any organization that plays an active role in the project and/or supports a research partnership through cash and/or in-kind contributions. Examples of a partner organization’s role may include:\n\nSharing in intellectual leadership or providing expertise;\n\nActive participation in research activities; and/or\n\nApplication of research results and/or active participation in translating or mobilizing the knowledge produced to help achieve the desired outcomes of the project.\n\nNational security risks may be described as, but not limited to circumstances where there are potential instances of foreign interference, espionage, intellectual property theft or unauthorized knowledge transfer that:\n\ncontribute to the advancement of military, security, and intelligence capabilities of states or groups that pose a threat to Canada; and/or\n\ndisrupt the development of Canadian research and innovation, weaken the resiliency of critical infrastructure, or jeopardize the protection of sensitive data of Canadians.\n\nThe information collected will not be used to substantiate if you are compliant with any legislative or regulatory requirements that may apply to your proposed research project. The collection of this information will be used to assess the overall risk profile of your research project.\n\nWho needs to complete the Risk Assessment Form?\n\nAnyone can use the Risk Assessment Form to conduct due diligence when establishing and/or continuing partnerships with national, international and multinational partners.\n\nThis form may be required for specified federal research funding opportunities. You should consult the appropriate program literature associated with the funding opportunity to which you are applying to determine if you are required to submit a Risk Assessment Form with your grant application.\n\nDepending on the specific funding opportunity, the “applicant” may be an individual, on behalf of any co-applicants, or may be a post-secondary or research institution.\n\nWhat resources and tools may assist you?\n\nYou are encouraged to conduct open-source research to complete the Risk Assessment Form and to consult with your partner organization(s), where appropriate, to validate the information. For more information, consult the comprehensive guide Conducting Open Source Due Diligence for Safeguarding Research Partnerships.\n\nAdditional guidance and resources, including Public Safety Canada’s Safeguarding Science Workshop and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service’s threat briefing and checklist, that may assist in the completion of this form can be located on the Safeguarding Your Research portal.\n\nSection 1: Know Your Research\n\nThe purpose of this section is to gather key information about your research. This information will be used to assess whether the nature and/or usability of your research project could attract the interest of foreign governments, militaries, their proxies, and other organizations who may seek to exploit research partnerships to access research information, research knowledge, and the resulting intellectual property and technology to facilitate unauthorized knowledge transfer.\n\nResearch areas that are sensitive or dual-use, in that they have military, intelligence, or dual military/civilian applications, are more likely to present national security risks.\n\nAnswers to the following questions will assist in determining the overall risk profile of your research project. Risk Assessment Forms are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and answering “yes” or “unsure” to any of these questions is not a determinant of a denial of funding. For more information on the risk assessment process, consult the Safeguarding Your Research portal.\n\nAnswer the following questions to the best of your ability by using information that can be reasonably accessed through open sources that are available to you.\n\nSection 2: Know Your Partner Organization\n\nThe purpose of this section is to assess whether your partner organization(s) could pose a national security risk by using the research knowledge, technology and intellectual property resulting from your research project. Your research can be an attractive target for those seeking to steal, use, and adapt it for their own priorities and gains. In some instances, research could lead to advancements in the strategic, military, or intelligence capabilities of other countries or be used to purposefully cause harm to Canada’s national security.\n\nThe following questions serve as a source of information to assist in determining the overall risk profile of your research partnership. Answering “yes” or “unsure” to any of these questions is not a determinant of a denial of funding.\n\nAnswer the following questions to the best of your ability by using information that is already available to you, your institution, or your partner organization(s), or that could be reasonably accessed through open sources. To further support transparency and openness, you are encouraged to consult your partner organization(s) when answering these questions. The Government of Canada may request more information from your partner organization(s) for the purposes of national security risk assessment.\n\nWhen answering these questions, you must consider and include information not only about your partner organization(s) but also their relevant affiliates. Therefore, for the purpose of this section, the term ‘partner organization’ also includes any affiliated parent organizations, subsidiaries, and joint ventures in Canada and abroad.\n\nIf your research partnership includes several partner organizations, you must complete one Risk Assessment Form that collectively considers the risks associated with all partner organizations.\n\nSection 3: Risk Identification\n\nThe purpose of this section is to collect information on any risk factors that you have identified in the two first sections of the form. To support the risk assessment process, your response must provide information on the source and nature of the risks.\n\nFor each “yes” or “unsure” response that you provided in the Know Your Research and Know Your Partner Organization sections, describe the resources you utilized and the key findings you gathered.\n\nYou may add any other relevant or contextual information related to your partner organization(s) in this section. For example, list any concerns noted during your due diligence process that have not been captured in a previous section of this form.\n\nMaximum of 4,800 characters with spaces.\n\nSection 4: Risk Mitigation Plan\n\nThe purpose of this section is to present your risk mitigation plan. This plan will ensure that you identify the appropriate mitigation measures to reduce the likelihood of an identified security risk materializing, and/or to lessen the impact in case the identified risk materializes.\n\nWhen developing your risk mitigation plan, you must address all risk factors that you identified by answering “yes” or “unsure” to questions in the Know Your Research and Know Your Partner Organization sections.\n\nYour risk mitigation plan should be developed with your institution. You may also involve your institution’s corporate support services (e.g., IT, security, legal) to confirm the viability and feasibility of the proposed measures.\n\nMitigation measures should be tailored to the research project and commensurate with the risks identified while considering open science principles. For instance, your risk mitigation plan could cover areas, such as, but not limited to:\n\nDescribing any other relevant review processes for which the project has been subject to (e.g., a Research Ethics Board review focusing on how personal data gathered through the research project will be safeguarded)\n\nRaising research security awareness and building capacity across your research team\n\nEnsuring that your partner organization(s)’ objectives align with the objectives of the partnership\n\nEnsuring sound cybersecurity and data management practices\n\nAgreement on the intended use of research findings\n\nFor each mitigation measure you propose, you must also provide a timeline for its implementation and describe how you and your institution will monitor its effectiveness.\n\nIt is not sufficient to refer to existing or upcoming policies and practices within your institution. If you refer to a policy or practice, you must also describe what this policy or practice entails and how it will be applied to mitigate the identified risks.\n\nThe National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships are country and company-agnostic as risks can evolve and originate from anyone and anywhere in the world. Following the principles of the Guidelines, risk mitigation measures must never lead to discrimination against or profiling of a member of the research community. Accordingly, excluding any individual from participating in the proposed research project on the basis of their citizenship or country of residence is not an acceptable risk mitigation measure.\n\nAdditional information on risk mitigation can be found on the Safeguarding Your Research portal.\n\nMaximum of 5,400 characters with spaces.\n\nSection 5: Additional Requirements\n\nBy submitting this Risk Assessment Form, the applicant on behalf of all co-applicants agrees that, to the best of their knowledge:"
