instruction the transaction is carried out is deemed to be a beneficial owner. Insofar as the contracting parties act as Treuhänder, they, too, are deemed to be trading on instruction.\n\nPart 2 Risk management\n\nSection 4 Risk management\n\n(1) In order to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, the obliged entities must have in place effective risk management systems that are appropriate for the nature and size of their business.\n\n(2) Risk management encompasses a risk analysis under section 5 as well as internal safeguards under section 6.\n\n(3) A member of the management is to be appointed to bear responsibility for risk management and compliance with provisions under anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing law under this and other Acts as well as with regulations adopted on the basis of this and other Acts. Risk analysis and internal safeguards must be approved by this member of the management.\n\n(4) Obliged entities under section 2 (1) no. 16 must have in place effective risk management systems if they make or receive cash payments of at least €10,000 in one transaction.\n\nSection 5 Risk analysis\n\n(1) The obliged entities are to determine and evaluate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing associated with the business activities they engage in. They are to pay particular attention to the risk factors specified in annexes 1 and 2 and to the information that is made available on the basis of the national risk assessment. 3The extent of the risk analysis depends on the nature and size of the business of the obliged entity.\n\n(2) The obliged entities are to\n\n1. document the risk analysis,\n\n2. regularly review and, as appropriate, update the risk analysis and\n\n3. make the most recent version of their risk analysis available to the supervisory authority upon request.\n\n(3) In cases where the obliged entity is the parent company of a group, subsections (1) and (2) apply to the whole group.\n\n(4) The supervisory authority may, at the request of an obliged entity, release the obliged entity from the obligation to document its risk analysis if the obliged entity can demonstrate that the specific risks inherent in the respective sector are clear and understood.\n\nSection 6 Internal Safeguards\n\n(1) Obliged entities are to implement appropriate business- and customer-oriented internal safeguards in the form of principles, procedures and controls in order to manage and mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing.Such measures are appropriate if they correspond to the risk situation of the obliged entity and cover it sufficiently. The obliged entities are to monitor the functionality of the internal safeguards and update them where necessary.\n\n(2) In particular, internal safeguards include:\n\n1. the development of internal principles, procedures and controls in relation to\n\na) dealing with risks under subsection (1),\n\nb) the customer due diligence requirements under sections 10 to 17\n\nc) compliance with the reporting obligation under section 43 (1)\n\nd) recording of information and retention of documents under section 8 and\n\ne) compliance with other provisions under anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing law,\n\n2. appointing a money laundering reporting officer and a deputy under section 7,\n\n3. in cases of obliged entities that are parent companies of a group, the establishment of group-wide procedures under section 9,\n\n4. the development and updating of appropriate measures to prevent the abuse of new products and technologies for committing money laundering and terrorist financing or for the purpose of promoting the anonymity of business relationships or transactions,\n\n5. the reliability screening of employees by appropriate means, in particular via systems of the obliged entity for controlling and appraising the staff,\n\n6. initial and ongoing training of employees with regard to the typologies and current methods of money laundering and terrorist financing and on the provisions and obligations relevant in this regard, including rules for data protection, and\n\n7. reviewing the above-mentioned principles and procedures in an independent inspection where such a review is appropriate given the nature and size of the business.\n\n(3) If an obliged entity under section 2 (1) nos. 10 to 14 and 16 performs their professional activities as an employee of a company, the obligations under subsections (1) and (2) fall to this company.\n\n(4) In addition to the measures set out in subsection (2), obliged entities under section 2 (1) no. 15 are to operate data processing systems that enable them to identify both business relationships and individual transactions in gambling operations and via a gambling account under section 16 that are to be regarded as suspicious or unusual given publicly available information on, or corporate experience of, the methods of money laundering and terrorist financing. They are to update these data processing systems. The supervisory authority may specify criteria on the basis of which, if met, the obliged entities under section 2 (1) no. 15 may be exempt from the obligation to use the data processing systems under sentence 1.\n\n(5) The obliged entities are to make arrangements appropriate to their nature and size to enable their employees and persons in a comparable position to report contraventions of provisions under anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing law to appropriate bodies while ensuring that their identity remains confidential.\n\n(6) The obliged entities are to make arrangements to ensure they are in a position, if asked by the German Financial Intelligence Unit (Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen) or by other competent authorities, to provide information as to whether they maintained a business relationship with certain persons during a period of five years prior to the enquiry, and what the nature of that relationship was. They are to ensure that the information is transmitted safely and confidentially to the institution making the enquiry. Obliged entities under section 2 (1) nos. 10 and 12 may refuse to provide information if the enquiry refers to information they received through a client relationship subject to professional secrecy. The obligation to provide information continues to exist if the obliged entity knows that their client has used or is using the relationship for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist financing.\n\n(7) The obliged entities may, on the basis of contractual agreement, engage third parties to implement internal safeguards if they notify the supervisory authority of this in advance. The supervisory authority may prohibit the transfer if\n\n1. the third party does not provide an assurance that the safeguards will be implemented properly,\n\n2. the management capabilities of the obliged entity would be adversely affected or\n\n3. supervision by the supervisory authority would be adversely affected.\n\nIn their notification, the obliged entities are to demonstrate that the criteria for prohibiting the transfer under sentence 2 are not fulfilled. The ultimate responsibility for implementing the safeguards continues to lie with the obliged entities.\n\n(8) In individual cases, the supervisory authority may issue appropriate and necessary orders to an obliged entity to implement the necessary internal safeguards.\n\n(9) The supervisory authority may order that the provisions of subsections (1) to (6) are to be applied, in a manner appropriate to the level of risk, to individual obliged entities or groups of obliged entities on account of the kind of transactions they engage in or of the size of their business, in consideration of the risks with regard to money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nSection 7 Money laundering reporting officer\n\n(1) Obliged entities under section 2 (1) nos. 1 to 3, 6, 7, 9 and 15 are to appoint a money laundering reporting officer at senior management level and a deputy. The money laundering reporting officer is responsible for compliance with the provisions under anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing law. They are directly subordinate to the top management level.\n\n2) The supervisory authority may exempt an obliged entity from the obligation to appoint a money laundering reporting officer if it is guaranteed that\n\n1. there is no risk of information loss or deficits on account of a separation of duties in the company structure and\n\n2. other provisions are made, after a risk-based evaluation, to prevent business relationships and transactions related to money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\n(3) The supervisory authority may order that obliged entities under section 2 (1) nos. 4, 5, 8, 10 to 14 and 16 are to appoint a money laundering reporting officer if it deems such an appointment appropriate. In the case of obliged entities under section 2 (1) no. 16, the order should be issued if the main activity of the obliged entity consists in trading in high-value goods.\n\n(4) The obliged entities are to give prior notification to the supervisory authority of the appointment or dismissal of the money laundering reporting officer or their deputy. The appointment of the money laundering reporting officer or the deputy must be revoked on the instruction of the supervisory authority if the appointee does not fulfil the requirements with regard to qualification or reliability.\n\n(5) The money laundering reporting officer must carry out their function in Germany. They must be the point of contact regarding compliance with the relevant provisions for the law enforcement agencies, for the authorities responsible for the detection, prevention and elimination of threats, for the German Financial Intelligence Unit and for the supervisory authority. The money laundering reporting officer is to be granted sufficient powers and the means necessary to carry out their function properly. In particular, they are to have or be given unrestricted access to all information, data, records and systems which could be of importance in the performance of their functions. The money laundering reporting officer is to report directly to the top management level.

These qualify as a record within the meaning of sentence 1. If a repeat identification is omitted pursuant to section 11 (3) sentence 1, the name of the person to be identified and the fact that the person was identified on a previous occasion are to be recorded. In the cases set out in section 12 (1) sentence 1 no. 2, instead of the type, number and issuing authority of the document presented for identification, the service and card identifier is to be recorded, as well as the fact that verification was carried out by means of an electronic proof of identity.When the verification of identity is carried out by means of a qualified signature pursuant to section 12 (1) sentence 1 no. 3, the validation thereof is also to be recorded.

In such a case, the obliged entity is also to ensure that a transaction is executed directly from a payment account within the meaning of section 1 (3) of the Payment Services Supervision Act which is held in the name of the contracting party, with an obliged entity under section 2 (1) sentence 1 no. 1 or no. 3 or with a credit institution domiciled in\n\n1. another member state of the European Union,\n\n2. a signatory state to the Agreement on the European Economic Area or\n\n3. a third country in which the credit institution is subject to due diligence and record-keeping requirements equivalent to the due diligence and record-keeping requirements laid out in Directive (EU) 2015/849 and whose observance is supervised in a manner consistent with Chapter IV Section 2 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.\n\n(2) In the cases set out in section 10 no. 1, verification of the identity of legal persons is to be carried out by means of\n\n1. an extract from the commercial register or register of cooperative societies or a comparable official register or directory\n\n2. formation documents or equivalent substantiating documents or\n\n3. a documented inspection by the obliged entity itself of the data in the register or directory.\n\n(3) The Federal Ministry of Finance may, in consultation with the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesministerium des Innern), designate further documents as appropriate for verifying identity by means of a regulation not requiring the consent of the Bundesrat.\n\nSection 13 Identity verification procedures, authorisation to issue regulations\n\n(1) Obliged entities verify the identity of natural persons by one of the following procedures:\n\n1. appropriate examination of the document presented physically or\n\n2. another procedure suitable for verifying identity under anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing law and having a security level equivalent to the procedure set out in no. 1.\n\n(2) The Federal Ministry of Finance may, in consultation with the Federal Ministry of the Interior, by means of a regulation not requiring the consent of the Bundesrat\n\n1. add more detail or further requirements to the procedure set out in subsection (1) or to the obliged entities using this procedure and\n\n2. define procedures that are appropriate for identification under anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing law in accordance with subsection (1) no. 2.\n\nSection 14 Simplified due diligence requirements, authorisation to issue regulations\n\n(1) Obliged entities that establish that, taking into account the risk factors specified in annexes 1 and 2, certain areas present only a small risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, particularly with regard to customers, transactions and services or products, are only required to fulfil simplified due diligence requirements. Before applying simplified due diligence requirements, obliged entities must ascertain that the business relationship or transaction actually entails a lower risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. For the demonstration of adequacy, section 10 (2) sentence 4 applies mutatis mutandis.\n\n(2) Where simplified due diligence requirements may be applied, obliged entities may\n\n1. reduce the extent of the measures to be taken to fulfil general due diligence requirements to an appropriate extent and\n\n2. in particular, by way of derogation from sections 12 and 13, carry out the verification of identity on the basis of other documents, data or information which originate from a credible and independent source and are suitable for the purpose of verification.\n\nIn each instance, the obliged entities must ensure the scrutiny of transactions and business relationships to an extent that enables them to recognise and report unusual or suspicious transactions.\n\n(3) In cases where the obliged entity is not in a position to fulfil the simplified due diligence requirements, section 10 (9) applies mutatis mutandis.\n\n(4) The Federal Ministry of Finance may, by means of a regulation not requiring the consent of the Bundesrat, in consultation with the Federal Ministry of the Interior, designate types of cases which can present a lower risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, particularly with regard to customers, products, services, transactions or delivery channels, and in which the obliged entities are only required to fulfil simplified due diligence requirements in relation to customers, under the conditions laid out in subsection (1). The risk factors specified in annexes 1 and 2 are to be taken into account in such a decision.\n\n(5) Directive (EU) 2015/847 does not apply to domestic transfers of funds to a payment account of a beneficiary to which only payments for the delivery of goods or services can be made, if\n\n1. the beneficiary’s payment service provider is subject to the requirements of this Act,\n\n2. the beneficiary’s payment service provider is able, using a unique transaction reference number, to trace the transfer of funds via the beneficiary back to the person who concluded an agreement with the beneficiary about the delivery of goods or services, and\n\n3. the amount transferred does not exceed €1,000.\n\nSection 15 Enhanced due diligence requirements, authorisation to issue regulations\n\n(1) The enhanced due diligence requirements are to be fulfilled in addition to the general due diligence requirements.\n\n(2) Obliged entities are to fulfil enhanced due diligence requirements if they find out, through a risk analysis or by taking into account the risk factors specified in annexes 1 and 2 in an individual case, that a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing may arise. The obliged entities determine the specific extent of measures to be taken in accordance with the respective higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. For the demonstration of adequacy, section 10 (2) sentence 4 applies mutatis mutandis.\n\n(3) A higher risk arises in particular\n\n1. if a contracting party of the obliged entity or a beneficial

2, at least the following enhanced due diligence requirements are to be fulfilled:\n\n1. the transaction is to be examined in order that the risk associated with the respective business relationship or transactions can be monitored and assessed with regard to money laundering and terrorist financing and in order that it can be determined, if applicable, whether a reporting requirement under section 43 (1) exists, and\n\n2. where a transaction is based on an underlying business relationship, this relationship is to be subject to enhanced, ongoing monitoring in order that the risk associated with the business relationship with regard to money laundering and terrorist financing can be assessed and, in the case of heightened risk, monitored.\n\n(6) In the case set out in subsection (3) no. 3, obliged entities under section 2 (1) nos. 1 to 3 and 6 to 9 are to at least fulfil the following enhanced due diligence requirements:\n\n1. sufficient information about the respondent is to be obtained, in order that the nature of their business can be fully understood and their reputation, their controls for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing and the

entities are to take account of the specific risk associated with politically exposed persons for at least twelve months after the person has left the public function and take appropriate and risk-adequate measures until it can be assumed that the risk no longer exists.\n\n(8) If there are facts or assessments from national or international agencies responsible for preventing or combating money laundering or terrorist financing that justify the assumption that a higher risk exists beyond the cases set out in subsection (3), the supervisory authority may order that the obliged entities enhance their monitoring of the transactions and business relationships and fulfil additional risk-adequate due diligence requirements.\n\n(9) If the obliged entity is not in a position to fulfil the enhanced due diligence requirements, section 10 (9) applies mutatis mutandis.\n\n(10) The Federal Ministry of Finance may, by means of a regulation not requiring the consent of the Bundesrat, designate types of cases in which a potentially higher risk of money laundering and terrorist financing exists, particularly with regard to customers, products, services, transactions or delivery
