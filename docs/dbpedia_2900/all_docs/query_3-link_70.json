        "text": "Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a commodity price surge and the Covid-19 pandemic have all posed a risk to food security around the world. While the resilience and self-sufficiency of the EU food system have ensured that the availability of food in the EU is not at risk, the Commission continues to take measures to prepare for and respond to potential threats to global food supply and food security.\n\nThe European Food Security Crisis preparedness and response Mechanism (EFSCM) was established to improve cooperation between the public and private sectors and evaluate risks when crises arise.\n\nA contingency plan for food supply and food security\n\nAs outlined in the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Commission has developed a contingency plan to ensure food supply and food security in times of crisis. The plan aims to ensure a sufficient and varied supply of safe, nutritious, affordable and sustainable food to citizens at all times.\n\nThe Commission published its Communication on the plan on 12 November 2021. It outlines areas for improvement that were identified during the Covid-19 pandemic, principles that should be adhered to in times of crisis, and the creation of a European Food Security Crisis preparedness and response Mechanism (EFSCM).\n\nThe Commission is supporting Ukraine in developing and implementing a short and medium term food security strategy. It has also put together measures to support EU farmers most affected by higher input costs and the closure of export markets.\n\nRelated information\n\nCoronavirus response\n\nSafeguarding food security and supporting EU farmers\n\nKey principle in preventing and tackling food crises in the EU\n\nThe lessons learned from various crises allow us to identify key principles to be followed to ensure food supply and food security when a crisis arises:\n\na collaborative approach between all public and private parties that play a role in the food supply chain;\n\nhorizontal coordination at political and administrative level, particularly when the crisis originates from factors outside the food supply chain, as was the case with the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine;\n\nmonitoring of market imbalances and where necessary, swift intervention using available tools, such as those that exist under the CAP and the CFP;\n\nsupply chains and trade flows remaining operational, including for non-food sectors that are essential to the functioning of the food supply chain;\n\nfree movement of cross-border and seasonal workers in the food sector as much as possible;\n\nearly, regular and transparent communication to stakeholders and the public to avoid the crisis being exacerbated through inappropriate information.\n\nEuropean Food Security Crisis preparedness and response Mechanism (EFSCM)\n\nTo implement the principles outlined above, the Commission established the EFSCM, which relies on a dedicated group of experts and a set of rules and procedures governing its activities. Stakeholder organisations that play a role in the food supply chain, as well as certain non-EU countries with food supply chains that are highly integrated with the EU’s, were invited to contribute to improving cooperation between the public and private sectors. The Commission published a call for participation, which was open from 10 December 2021 to 4 February 2022.\n\nThe Commission convenes the group of experts periodically to improve levels of preparedness. The group may be convened in case of emergency or crisis without delay and as often as needed, to contribute to the response. The mechanism is triggered in case of exceptional, unpredictable and large-scale events or risks that have the potential to threaten EU food supply or security.\n\nOutcomes of the EFSCM\n\nThe EFSCM adopted three sets of recommendations on crisis communication, on diversity of sources of supply, and on mitigating risks in the food supply chain which are part of a number of actions carried out to improve the EU preparedness. The outcomes of the work of the forum also include the creation of the Food supply and security dashboard.\n\nFood supply and security dashboard\n\nThis dashboard features data to monitor and assess food supply and food security in the EU. It also includes external sources that serve as an alert system.\n\nThe Communication on the contingency plan for ensuring food supply and food security in times of crisis presented the creation of this dashboard as one of the actions under the framework of the EFSCM.\n\nExplore now\n\nFurthermore, results of bi-annual EU surveys among EFSCM members are analysed and published in periodic reports. By gathering market intelligence and making assessments of causes, drivers, and events that impact the EU food supply and food security, the surveys intend to supplement the data in the food supply and security dashboard.\n\nThe Joint Research Centre (JRC) recently published a study on risks and vulnerabilities affecting food supply and food security in the EU. It finds that the EU food supply chain faces a broad range of risks and sheds light on the factors that make it vulnerable to these risks.\n\nReport on the activities of the EFSCM summarizing the work of the Mechanism since its creation in November 2021\n\nMore information\n\nCommunication on contingency plan for ensuring food supply and food security in times of crisis\n\nCommission Staff Working Document SWD2021 (317)\n\nCommission Decision on setting up a group of experts on the European Food Security Crisis preparedness and response Mechanism\n\nCommission Staff Working Document SWD2021 (318) – synopsis report\n\nExpert group members\n\nThe members of the EFSCM are listed hereunder and can be viewed by clicking on the categories below: EU countries, non-EU countries, organisations, observers.
