        "text": "Issues and Recommendations\n\nMany industrialised nations with ageing and shrink­ing demographics are seeing a rise in structural labour shortages, while many poorer countries have to cope with strong population growth and increasing difficulties in providing work and sufficient income for their young adults. The shrinking of Germany’s working population will be particularly drastic in coming years as cohorts with high birth rates reach retirement age. The Institute for Employment Research (IAB) of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) predicts that the current labour volume can only be main­tained with an annual net immigration of 400,000 workers until 2035. The labour shortage – particu­larly in the social and education sectors, health and care, construction and the skilled crafts and STEM jobs – can no longer be compensated by internal EU migration alone because all EU states are experienc­ing a similar demographic transformation. This makes attracting workers from third countries, in­clud­ing partner countries of German development cooperation, of strategic importance for the future.\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, some efforts have been made to open up Germany’s labour mar­ket. However, they focused on liberalising especially the immigration of highly skilled workers so that, according to the Organisation for Economic Coopera­tion and Development (OECD), in 2013 Germany already had the lowest legal hurdles to the immi­gra­tion of such workers among all OECD countries. By contrast, the immigration of skilled and low qualified workers was pursued much less consistently. The Chris­tian Democrat-Social Democrat coalition gov­ern­ment under Chancellor Angela Merkel, which was in office until 2021, picked up the thread again and, among other things, adopted the Skilled Immigration Act (FEG) in 2020. This law enables nationals from third countries with eligible professional training to enter Germany to seek work or to have their pro­fes­sional qualifications recognised. However, its effects have so far been very limited: because the Covid-19 pandemic sharply reduced international mobility, in 2021 only about 25,000 skilled workers in total came to Germany under the new FEG rules, and about 8,000 third-country nationals used the expanded immigration possibilites to seek work. Moreover, in 2021 only 3,000 people made use of the Western Balkans Regulation, which makes it possible for any­one without qualification requirements to immigrate so as to take up a job offer.\n\nFurther measures will be necessary to meet Ger­many’s demand by attracting skilled as well as low qualified workers from abroad. The substantial num­ber of refugees from Ukraine and asylum-seekers from other regions of the world will not change this. Germany will have to be more active in recruiting the workers it needs, including from its development partner countries. To this end, administrative pro­cedures must also be simplified and accelerated.\n\nHowever, recruitment has been a controversial subject in development cooperation for a long time. It has been argued that the emigration of urgently needed skilled labour, especially from the health sector, risks causing a brain drain and development setbacks in the countries of origin. Commentators also point to the human-rights violations to which migrants are often vulnerable in host countries, for instance the Gulf States. In contrast, advocates of recruiting workers abroad emphasise the substantial contribution to development that migration can make in countries of origin, as well as the individual opportunities that can be associated with migration – if the latter is safe, orderly and regular.\n\nThe German government will have to involve itself in this debate even more fervently in years to come. All forecasts agree that the demographically gen­er­ated need for labour will increase so sharply that larger recruitment programmes will become neces­sary. Simultaneously, other industrialised countries are also facing similar challenges and are recruiting suitable workers. This competition will increase. Germany could gain the competitive advantage if it succeeds in concluding development-orientated and fair partnerships with countries of origin, which also take into account the interests of those partner coun­tries and stipulate high standards for protecting migrant workers. The German government will there­fore have to reflect not only on how to shape state-led recruitment but also on how the private recruitment of workers from development partner nations can be designed, supported and regulated.\n\nThis is the background against which the paper explores the state and non-state efforts in Germany to recruit workers, especially from its development cooperation partner countries, and examines the asso­ciated conflicting political objectives and the opportunities and risks for development.\n\nControversies in Development Policy\n\nThe interaction between migration and development has long been disputed in research and policy. How­ever, there is a broad consensus on the fact that the development impact of migration flows ultimately depends on how they are shaped politically: fundamentally, well-managed migration has more positive consequences for the development of origin and host countries than irregular migration. The opportunities for those involved are also lower where there is insufficient political control. This principle also holds true for the design of labour recruitment.\n\nOver time, positive interpretations have alternated with negative interpretations of the links between labour migration and development, and whichever perspective prevailed during a given period also shaped the way that development policy approached migration. Thus, positive assessments of migrant labour at first predominated in the 1950s and 1960s. At the time, in the context of economic growth after the Second World War, such labour was primarily seen as a balancing mechanism between labour mar­kets with differing supply and demand structures. The assumption was that migration – mainly in the shape of “guest workers” who were unskilled or learned on the job – would contribute to growth in both their countries of origin and the industrialized Western countries hosting them. In the two decades that followed, this assumption was replaced by more pessimistic assessments. Now, the prevailing view was that migrant workers were exploited and that their recruitment removed skilled labour from their coun­tries of origin that was indispensable for their devel­op­ment (in other words, a brain drain). Money trans­fers by migrants were also considered a problem: the remitted sums – it was claimed – were mainly used for consumption, which aggravated inflation in the country of origin and kept women out of the labour market there; therefore, they did not promote devel­opment.\n\nIn the early 1990s, development policy became more interested in labour migration.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the pendulum swung the other way again. Under the paradigm of the New Economics of Labour Migration and the accelerating globalisation of the world economy, development policy became more interested in labour migration; the latter was now considered to have a markedly positive influence on development processes.\n\nFor some time, however, there has been a countermovement in research, which questions the optimistic paradigm concerning migration and development policy. Its criticism derives from the assumption that the positive assessment of (labour) migration and devel­opment is part of a neoliberal agenda. It believes that supporting money transfers and diasporas relieves host countries of their responsibility for migrants and refugees, and that the promotion of circular migration movements accommodates the interests of the industrialized host countries in cheap and available workers. In both cases, so the argument runs, the fate of individual migrants – who ultimately bear the social and economic costs, especially women – risks being ignored. In fact, many countries of origin now insist much more emphatically on good and fair work­ing conditions for their migrant workers, and they denounce human-rights violations against their citizens or negative impacts on development much more stringently than before.\n\nMoreover, there continues to be both academic and political disagreement about whether more development leads to more or less (labour) migration, and what conclusions should be drawn from this for de­vel­opment cooperation. Thus, many economists have long held the view that migration from poorer to richer parts of the world could be reduced through development. This thesis has been challenged by the insight derived from development economics that development processes generally lead to an increase in migration first – the so-called “migration hump”. As the level of a developing country’s socioeconomic development increases, migration from it also tends to keep growing – until incomes reach the upper middle class; only then will migration diminish. The theoretical and empirical controversy surrounding the issue has not been resolved, and it is very likely to continue influencing the discussion over the con­sequences of recruitment for development.\n\nIn summary, there is still controversy on many of the links between migration and development in research. Given the differing normative positions of the researchers, this is hardly surprising. However, there is agreement on a few points at least. These in­clude the fact that migration, displacement and devel­opment are closely linked; that the impact of migra­tion on development depends on how it is managed; and that framework conditions which pro­mote devel­opment require an intensive and binding cooperation with development partner countries. The current Ger­man government shares this assessment, as is clear from its 2021 coalition agreement .\n\nLabour Migration Policy and Recruitment\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, all German fed­eral governments have made efforts to encourage the immi­gration of labour and initiate corresponding reforms. In fact, since then, Germany has gradually changed from the “unwilling immigration country” of Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s era to a “modern immi­gration country” – a development acknowledged by the OECD as far back as 2013 when it stated that Germany now had the most generous immigration rules for skilled and highly skilled workers of all OECD members. Nevertheless, actual immigration numbers have in no phase met the political expectations of the previous or current federal governments, and the search for ways of fostering labour migration continues.\n\nThe reform of the Nationality Act initiated in 2000 by the then-coalition government of Christian Demo­crats and Socialists, the Green Card Regulation of 2001 and the reform of the Residence Act in 2004 have put an end to decades of standstill in German migration policy and set the course for a modern migration policy. All important political forces have eventually participated in these reforms and nego­tiated the new immigration legislation in a lengthy and difficult cross-party process. The necessity for and direction of the reforms are now undisputed, at least by the parties represented in the German Bundestag, except by Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).\n\nGermany has gradually opened up to labor immigration over the past decade.\n\nThis is how federal governments of the past decade have taken important strategic decisions on pro­moting labour immigration, especially with the skilled labour concept of 2011, the progress report on the skilled labour concept of 2017 and the skilled labour strategy of 2018. Their objectives all include promoting immigration as well as activating domestic potential. The federal states have also developed strat­egies for skilled labour security, among others by sup­porting the recognition of foreign professional quali­fi­cations and the recruitment of foreign students.\n\nThe skilled labour strategy of 2018 adopted concrete measures to increase that labour potential, such as developing the Skilled Immigration Act (FEG), which came into force in 2020, to actively promote the immigration of skilled workers to Germany. These measures are accompanied by others, such as the ex­pan­sion of German language courses on offer abroad, targeted ad campaigns, information and additional opportunities to train or retrain in Germany. In December 2019, the federal government agreed a com­plementary strategy to recruit skilled workers , which stipulates a targeted expansion of its coopera­tion with countries that have skilled labour potential.\n\nFinally, in October 2022, the cabinet adopted a new skilled labour strategy, which provides for an immigration policy that further develops the FEG and for further administrative reforms in recruitment. As part of this, the federal government in late Novem­ber 2022 published a white paper on amending the law on skilled labour immigration, with the objective of making the recruitment of such workers from third countries for the German labour market simpler and quicker.\n\nThe Current Legal Framework\n\nSkilled immigration\n\nFederal governments since 2012 have above all lowered conditions for highly skilled workers with academic qualifications. They have created new limited residence permits to offer more attractive immigration possibilities for academics, such as the EU Blue Card in 2012 or the Intra Corporate Transfer Card in 2014. Since 2012 graduates of foreign uni­versities have also been able to travel to Germany to look for a job. After two years in a job that corresponds to their skills, they can also apply for a per­manent residence permit.\n\nInitially, these reforms simplified immigration for non-academic workers only to a limited extent. Thus in 2013 workers with a professional qualification were permitted to enter Germany to work in certain understaffed occupations.\n\nRecognition legislation\n\nLegislation on improving the assessment and recog­nition of professional qualifications obtained abroad also entered into effect in 2012. The so-called Recog­ni­tion Act was intended to create uniform procedures for the more than 600 federally controlled occupations in Germany, so as to confirm equivalence be­tween foreign professional qualifications and German ones. The federal states complemented the Act by adopt­ing their own recognition legislation for teach­ing and social professions, which fall under their juris­diction. This created the legal right for third coun­try nationals to start recognition processes. Under the FEG, the recognition of foreign professional qualifi­cation is in many cases the crucial prerequisite for skilled workers from third countries to be allowed to immigrate to Germany.\n\nIn 2021 three-quarters of applications for the recog­nition of federally controlled professions came from third-country nationals – most frequently from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Philippines and Serbia. Two-thirds of the applications were for medical health jobs, followed by non-federally controlled occu­pations such as electronics technicians and cooks. Overall, 39,300 applications for recognition were reviewed at the federal level. Fewer than half of appli­cations from third countries were found to be equiva­lent, whilst the majority of qualifications from within the EU were considered equivalent.\n\nThe interim assessment after ten years of the Recog­nition Act is that the legislation has had a positive effect on the employment rate and rate of income and contributed to improving immigrants’ integration into the labour market, but that further simplifications are necessary. This is confirmed by the federal government in its new skilled labour strategy, which points out that immigrants are more likely to have jobs below their skills level than the overall population.\n\nThe Skilled Immigration Act (FEG)\n\nThe FEG, which came into effect on 1 March 2020, is intended to facilitate the immigration of third-country nationals for employment purposes and to create new prospects for recruiting skilled workers from third countries. To achieve this, the FEG has simplified the entry of third-country nationals for qualified on-the-job or vocational training including a “search option”, allowing them to enter first and only then search for a training position. However, the most far-reaching change is the creation of a unified concept of “skilled worker”: it now includes those with a vocational training as well as university graduates.\n\nThe FEG has also introduced an accelerated skilled labour process to reduce the administrative procedure before the skilled worker’s arrival in Germany. This procedure can also be used for trainees and those wish­ing to complete a qualification. So far, however, the accelerated procedure can only be initiated for a fee by businesses that recruit abroad, not by the skilled worker himself or herself.\n\nThe need for a BA priority test is usually eliminated by the FEG, as is the case with the regulation on short­age occupations. Thus, the entry for skilled workers with non-academic qualifications is no longer limited to professions in which the BA has determined a shortage but is open to all professions for which the third-country nationals’ qualifications are suitable. However, a prerequisite for the entry of skilled work­ers from third countries is that they already have a job offer and that their vocational and educational qualifications have been recognised as equivalent to German standards.\n\nThe FEG stipulates further exceptions to be applied to skilled workers from third countries to allow their entry under the following conditions:\n\nWhen assessing the results of the FEG to date, it must be remembered that the Covid pandemic made its application more difficult. It is therefore not yet impossible to tell how, in the medium term, the FEG might have any noticeable effect on labour migration. However, the numbers of skilled workers who have immigrated have so far fallen markedly short of politi­cal expectations, which is probably due in part to companies’ general reservations about recruiting foreign labour in third countries.\n\nImmigration of low-qualified workers\n\nLow-qualified workers continue to have very limited and temporary opportunities to immigrate – which the federal government will have to expand if it wants to meet the demand in this area.\n\nWestern Balkans Regulation\n\nThe key instrument for the immigration of third-country nationals without vocational or academic qualifications is the Western Balkans Regulation. In 2016 it made possible for the first time a more diverse labour migration from third countries. The back­ground to this was a growing desire to migrate on the part of people from the Western Balkans, who had little legal channels to immigrate to Germany and were, if they applied for asylum after having arrived in Germany, very rarely recognised as in need of international protection. In 2014 and 2015, these countries were therefore declared safe countries of origin. Since this was politically controversial within the federal government and the German Bundesrat, as a political compromise the Western Balkans Regu­lation was adopted at the same time. This special provision gave unskilled workers from Albania, Bos­nia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia the opportunity to immigrate legally without having their qualifications or language skills tested. To be eligible, workers had to prove that they have a BA-approved job offer from a German firm.\n\nThe Regulation has been prolonged twice and is now limited to an annual quota of 25,000 workers until 2023. According to the government’s coalition agreement and new skilled labour strategy, the Regu­lation is to be made permanent. The government has also announced in its recently adopted white paper on the immigration of skilled workers from third coun­tries that it intends to raise the quota significantly on a permanent basis and possibly extend it to other countries. During the Covid pandemic, entries under the Western Balkans Regulations dropped sharply; how­ever, a clear increase is expected for the reporting year 2022.\n\nThe Western Balkans Regulation can be seen as an example of a successful migration policy.\n\nThe Western Balkans Regulation is seen as an ex­ample of a successful migration policy. However, its medium and long-term consequences cannot be pre­dicted as yet, and there is criticism of the long wait for visas. In April 2020, these periods are said to have exceeded a year in five of the six foreign missions of the Western Balkan nations. There are also concerns of a further brain drain, even though the future de­vel­opment of immigration under the Western Balkans Regulation in Germany is difficult to predict. How­ever, the region is likely to lose additional skilled workers over the coming ten years and immigration to lessen only after that period. The German Marshall Fund (GMF) points out that the Western Balkan nations are amongst the countries hardest hit by brain drain worldwide. According to its figures, Serbia has lost 9 per cent of its inhabitants in the past three decades, North Macedonia 10 per cent, Bosnia and Herzegovina 24 per cent and Albania 37 per cent, most of them young, educated and qualified.\n\nBilateral recruitment agreements for seasonal workers\n\nThe BA and the employment authorities of third coun­tries can also conclude bilateral recruitment agreements for seasonal workers in agriculture and the food industry (for a maximum of six months per year). These agreements provide for visa-less entry with the BA work permit without priority test. Such workers must be treated as equal to comparable Ger­man workers, for instance with regards to working hours or pay. Since January 2020 an agreement has existed with the Georgian employment authorities, which is restricted to agriculture and a stay of 90 days within a 180-day period. The first Georgian seasonal workers arrived in 2021. The quota will be adjusted annually; it is currently 5,000. However, far fewer seasonal workers actually came to Germany. In July 2021 the BA also concluded a recruitment agreement with the Republic of Moldova for a quota of 500 sea­sonal labourers for the harvest season of 2022. To recruit seasonal workers, the BA is also in contact with other third countries such as Bosnia and Herze­go­vina or Albania but not with partner countries out­side of Europe.\n\nRecent Developments and Reform Efforts\n\nGermany’s coalition government announced a “para­digm shift” in German migration and integration policy in its coalition agreement of November 2021. Among other things, it intends to add a supply-ori­entated pillar to the so far mainly demand-orientated system of labour migration, with an “opportunity card” based on points, which is meant to facilitate access to the German labour market for skilled work­ers even without a job offer. The EU Blue Card is also to be expanded to non-academic occupations, and time limits in existing labour migration rules are to be removed. As well as speeding up the visa process, the intention is to lower obstacles to qualifications being recognised, to dismantle bureaucracy and to accelerate procedures in general.\n\nIn June 2022 the federal government adopted its first migration package, which, among other things, aims to put an end to the practice of repeatedly issu­ing certificates of exceptional right to remain, to facili­tate family reunification and to offer asylum-seekers better access to language and integration courses. The federal government’s new white paper on skilled labour immigration also stipulates further legislative changes intended to further simplify the recruitment and entry of workers from third coun­tries. Foreign skilled workers are to be able to pursue any qualified employment in non-regulated occupations in the future, regardless of their specific qualifi­cation (“skilled workers pillar”). In addition, under certain conditions, entry for skilled workers is to be made possible even without the often lengthy formal recognition of foreign vocational qualifications (the “experience pillar”). The “opportunity card”, which was announced in the coalition agreement and is based on a points system using criteria such as quali­fi­cations, language skills, professional experience, con­nection to Germany and age (the “potential pil­lar”), will now also be introduced. In contrast with the reforms initiated by the previous government, the current coalition moreover wants to enable low qua­lified workers to immigrate temporarily or permanently for employment in sectors with labour short­ages.\n\nAdministrative capacity is needed to implement the planned reforms.\n\nHowever, by themselves these legal changes will in all probability not solve recruitment problems. The decisive factor will be whether adequate administrative support exists to implement these planned reforms and whether there are sufficient administrative capac­ities. The main problem is still the long wait for visas and the inadequate administrative and infra­structure in Germany. In 2022 its Foreigners’ Offices, which are chronically overwhelmed in any case, were faced with the additional challenge of taking in refu­gees from Ukraine. In recent years, substantial capac­ity had already been tied up by the implementation of the many changes to migration policy. Further reforms and tasks can only be implemented appropriately if these shortages are tackled.\n\nThe federal government has reacted to some of these administrative bottlenecks in its recently adopted white paper, for instance by announcing that it in­tends to replace paper applications for skilled labour immigration by a completely digital visa procedure within the current legislative period. To this end, the Foreigners’ Offices in the various federal states will have to move in the same direction. This has not always been the case. It is problematic that the cen­tral authorities for skilled labour immigration en­visaged by the FEG have so far only been established in nine (of the 16) federal states.\n\nActors and Structures of Germany’s Recruitment Policy\n\nThe more recent reforms to Germany’s migration policy are ultimately intended to dismantle bureaucratic barriers to recruitment, and to improve and expand information and advice, initiatives and pilot projects in this area. Successful recruitment also depends on the commitment of employers. It should be expected that many German firms will continue to lack sufficient capacities to recruit workers abroad by themselves. They will need to keep relying on state support and some on non-state intermediaries. Fun­damentally, valuable lessons can be learned from the pilot projects carried out to date on how to cooperate with countries of origin.\n\nGovernment recruitment structures\n\nA large number of German state actors participates in Germany’s recruitment policy, including many minis­tries and state implementers. However, recruitment still resembles a patchwork, and overlapping port­folios prevent recruitment policy from being coherent.\n\nNevertheless, Germany’s experience with inter­departmental coordination has been positive, espe­cially during the high immigration levels of 2015–16. The most important coordination mechanisms have included meetings of the secretaries of state. BMAS and BMI cooperated closely on integration courses and implemented the language programme “Gemeinsames Programm Sprache”; interministerial cooperation also worked well when the FEG was being drawn up. Other examples are more complex: the BMBF is responsible for the legal basis under­pinning the recognition of foreign vocational qualifi­cations (the recognition act) but it is implemented by the BA and BMAS.\n\nThe federal government’s new skilled labour strat­egy has in 2022 established a steering meeting of sec­retaries of state to work out a white paper for skilled labour recruitment. Such ad-hoc coordi­nation is valuable but not sufficient when the goal is to achieve a truly comprehensive approach – taking into account foreign and development-policy goals. A cer­tain level of staffing and resources is necessary for the requisite continuous exchange with other depart­ments and institutions. This becomes evident in com­plex projects such as transnational training partner­ships, during which several departments need to co­operate closely with each other and with other actors, including in the partner country. Figure 1 (pp. 25) gives an overview over the most important actors in government recruitment policy and their key tasks.\n\nIn summary, the structures of state actors in recruit­ment are extremely complex and the division of responsibilities is often not very clear-cut. In gen­eral Germany lacks a whole-of-government approach to balance out and moderate the ministries’ different interests, to assign responsibilities and to define the tasks of subordinate institutions.\n\nRecruitment by Companies\n\nSo far, only a small proportion of German companies has looked for workers abroad. In 2022 only 17 per cent of companies polled in a survey by the Bertelsmann Foundation recruited skilled workers abroad, a number that has remained constant for several years. Instead, they attempted to solve their skilled labour shortages by using the labour potential in Germany, especially by providing better working conditions, promoting work/life balance and offering initial and further training. Yet at the same time, few of the busi­nesses polled believed that the skilled workers already in Germany would be sufficient. Over two-thirds would welcome more state recruitment agree­ments for recruiting foreign skilled workers and trainees. Moreover, those companies polled which had already recruited abroad indicated that bureaucratic and legal hurdles as well as language barriers had increased.\n\nLarge businesses and multinational corporations headquartered in Germany can often resort to their own recruitment structures or relocate their own workers to Germany. Fundamentally, recruiting work­ers carries direct recruitment costs, as well as expenses for legal advice on residency and taxes or for travel, moving and settling in.\n\nLarge companies can usually shoulder these expen­ditures more easily than small and medium enter­prises (SMEs); they also more frequently resort to non-state recruitment actors where internal company structures cannot be used.\n\nSMEs in particular increasingly use digital recruit­ment opportunities such as websites, career networks and online job boards to recruit skilled workers. The digital approach is becoming more and more impor­tant in recruiting abroad too. This is true for inter­national career networks such as LinkedIn but also the job portal “Make it in Germany”, supported by the federal government.\n\nSMEs are especially dependent on support from Chambers of Industry and Commerce (IHKs), Cham­bers of Crafts and other institutions for recruitment abroad. This covers tasks both within Germany, such as support with integrating workers into firms or with obtaining recognition for foreign qualifications, and with actual recruitment abroad. Key actors here are DIHK and the Chambers of Commerce Abroad (AHKs) that it coordinates.\n\nThe AHKs have structures in many potential recruit­ment countries that can help find workers for Ger­man companies and support potential emigrants when learning German. AHKs can already help with preparing visa procedures under an agreement with the German Federal Foreign Office (AA), although the final verification of documents is still the responsibility of diplomatic missions. The DIHK has pointed out that the AHKs would be able to take over the recog­nition of non-formal qualifications abroad as soon as a legal basis was created for this.\n\nCompany surveys show a clear preference for recruit­ing workers from Europe, followed by Asia and the Middle East. There has so far been little interest in recruiting labour from sub-Saharan Africa. Employ­ers evidently concentrate on countries which they con­sider to be geographically (or supposedly culturally) close to Germany or with which they have recruitment networks already.\n\nNon-State Labour Migration Intermediaries (LMI)\n\nInternational recruitment of workers using non-state intermediaries is on the increase worldwide. These intermediaries are part of a growing field of migration-related services that is known as “migration in­dus­tries” or “Labour Migration Intermediaries” (LMI) in research.\n\nNon-state LMI support workers willing to migrate in many ways. These include information on and contact with potential employers as well as help with tackling bureaucratic hurdles before departure. They provide financial services when migrant workers need to take out a loan to finance their journeys. They logis­tically support emigration and transport, and often remain important interlocutors even after work­ers have successfully emigrated, for instance regard­ing integration problems in the host country. De facto, LMI take on tasks that are traditionally incum­bent on the state. They thus influence not only the information that potential migrant workers receive but also their selection process as well as their living and working conditions in the destination country.\n\nThe legal framework in both the country of origin and of destination are decisive for the extent of non-governmental recruitment.\n\nThere are no reliable data on the extent of non-state recruitment. However, the legal framework is clearly decisive for LMI. The more open and liberal the legislation of the countries of origin and destination, the better their activities can flourish. There are national differences also in legal arrangements to protect against exploitative and abusive recruitment practices. While important countries of origin for migrant labour such as the Philippines, Bangladesh and Mexico have had such laws for some time, many target countries in the Middle East, Western Europe and North America have only caught up recently in response to abusive recruitment practices and people trafficking.\n\nIn the German-speaking world, the role of LMI has been little researched so far. Only recruitment agen­cies for care workers (primarily from Eastern Europe) have attracted much attention. LMI can be divided into formal and informal actors, which in turn pur­sue either commercial or non-commercial interests (see Figure 2).\n\nFormal LMI\n\nFormal actors include a broad range of recruitment agencies and consultancies, law firms, temping agen­cies and human-resources multinationals such as Rand­stad, Adecco or Manpower. According to the inter­national umbrella organisation for recruitment agencies, the World Employment Confederation, in 2020 the global turnover of private recruitment actors stood at US$465 billion. 190,000 private agencies with 3.7 million employees supported the recruitment of a total of 58m workers, 783,000 in Germany alone. With­out the Covid pandemic, these estimates would probably be even higher.\n\nIn Germany formal LMI have to follow a number of legal guidelines. Thus, recruiting for health and care jobs from 47 poorer nations is prohibited by the Ordi­nance on the Employment of Foreigners (§ 38) for pri­vate recruitment and remains the exclusive right of the BA. Many LMI operating in Germany have spe­cialised in shortage occupations such as care and IT. There is a marked tendency to professionalisation among private LMI, which increasingly advertise the fact that they have been certified.\n\nThere are further formal LMI, including educational institutions, which not only provide services in lan­guage acquisition or technical or vocational training but also directly support companies in recruiting international workers. An example is Berlitz, a com­pany that provides language teaching as well as sup­port for recruiting labour abroad for Germany, for instance by organising selection interviews in coun­tries of origin. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and trade unions can also increasingly be considered formal LMI – even if it does not correspond to their self-image – since they pursue (non-commercial) interests concerning migrant workers’ rights. How­ever, they have so far rarely been included in recruit­ment processes even though they would constitute efficient protection against exploitative or abusive recruit­ment practices.\n\nInformal LMI\n\nThe number of informal LMI in international recruit­ment is likely to be a multiple of the number of for­mal actors. They are often subcontractors used, for instance, to recruit workers from rural parts of a coun­try of origin. Thus, unregistered LMI are often at the very start of the recruitment process, by putting work­ers willing to migrate in contact with official agen­cies. This activity requires no particular qualification but does not usually bring in much money for the subcontractors either.\n\nThe informal actors also include the migrant workers themselves. In collaboration with other LMI, they are often important for recruiting and integrating further workers owing to their personal networks in the countries of origin and their local and linguistic knowledge. Researchers consider migrant networks to be important. These networks are often informal but in Germany there are also 15,000 registered diaspora organisations. They are structured into local, regional and increasingly transregional umbrella organisations.\n\nThe level of institutionalisation and financing of these networks varies greatly. They occur as volunteer associations or in the shape of professionalised orga­ni­sations with fulltime staff. Their activities focus on supporting workers arriving in Germany. However, so far only about five per cent of diaspora organisations in Germany are active as LMI, according to a survey by the Expert Council on Integration and Migration (SVR).\n\nInformal LMI broadly defined also include criminal organisations which recruit migrants abroad for ex­ploitation and which profit from the transport and brokerage in the destination country. National legis­lation and international conventions have focused particularly on fighting human trafficking for sex but have more recently also addressed forms of forced labour and the systematic exploitation of workers.\n\nProgrammes and Pilot Projects in Recruitment\n\nMany pilot projects and programmes to promote migra­tion of workers and trainees have been implemented in Germany over the past decade. According to a cur­rent survey by the European Migration Network (EMN), Germany is the EU member with the most initiatives in this area. Three types of recruit­ment projects can broadly be distinguished, especially in the partner coun­tries for German international development, each of which combines recruitment, vocational train­ing and further training in a specific way:\n\nType 1:\n\nprojects to promote the mobility of skilled labour\n\nType 2:\n\ntraining partnerships in a dual system and,\n\nType 3:\n\nglobal skills partnerships with an element of vocational training and further training in the country of origin.\n\nType 1 projects recruit qualified skilled workers from abroad so that, once in Germany, they can complete additional training or obtain a qualification that allows their vocational skills to be fully recognised. Type 2 partnerships aim to recruit young people to complete (dual) vocational training in Germany; and Type 3 provides investment in the training capacities and infrastructure in countries of origin so as to im­prove the level of qualifications there, not just for potential migrant labour but also for workers who want to remain in their country (see Info box 5, page 30).\n\nNot all projects can be presented here or assigned to the tripartite order. However, it must be noted that recruitment projects have become differentiated and more developed. Instead of recruiting skilled workers abroad (Type 1), projects in a growing number of sec­tors and partner countries increasingly concentrate on full vocational training in Germany (Type 2). They also increasingly pursue development concepts to do justice to the development “triple win” approach: for the country of origin (by relieving the labour market, remittances, relieving the social security system, strengthening the vocational training system), the host country (by meeting the demand for labour) and the migrants themselves (through access to higher incomes or experience of working internationally). Simultaneously, there are practical obvious difficulties in orientating Type 3 projects towards development in their design and realisation.\n\nState-led recruitment projects\n\nThe traditional approach to recruitment, including in development partner countries, is Type 1. In Germany the most prominent example is the Triple Win pro­gramme, under which the German agency for inter­national cooperation (GIZ) with the help of the BA’s International and Specialised Services (ZAV) has since 2013 been recruiting skilled care workers for German clinics, retirement homes and outpatient care services. These workers are from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Phil­ippines and Tunisia, whose qualifications are in prin­ciple eligible for recognition in Germany. They are prepared linguistically and interculturally in their home countries and benefit from an accelerated rec­og­nition procedure in Germany and usually also receive additional training. While the recruitment agreement with Serbia was cancelled in late 2020 at Serbia's request because the government did not want any further outflow of nursing staff, the BA has only recently concluded new recruitment agreements with Indonesia, India (only with the state of Kerala) and Jordan. Since 2013 a total of 4,900 skilled carers have been recruited, of which over 3,500 have already taken up work in Germany. The programme is to be extended to professions in the hotel and restaurant industry. As a rare exception, Triple Win was origi­nally financed by the state (the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy – BMWi) and has since 2018 been financed privately by German care-sector companies.\n\nSince early 2022, the ZAV has also been following the example of the “triple win” concept to recruit care workers from Mexico and Brazil, whom it selects to­gether with German clinics and care institutions. How­ever, to date a recruitment agreement only exists with Mexico. Under the programme, costs incurred are paid by employers, who also have to provide ad­equate housing and support with professional and social integration. Efforts to recruit workers for the health and care sectors have developed particularly rapidly over the past decade, driven by a series of new initiatives by the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) (see Info box 4).\n\nThere are also projects to recruit skilled workers and trainees for other sectors experiencing shortages, such as IT, construction and the hotel and restaurant in­dus­try. Pilot projects are being realised jointly by the IHK, Chambers of Crafts, AHKs and professional asso­ciations. The BMWK, for example, funds the pilot project “Hand in Hand for International Talents”, which is being implemented by the DIHK and BA in close collaboration with the AHKs. The project primarily supports small and medium enterprises in recruiting skilled labour from Brazil, India and Vietnam with a vocational qualification as construction and electron­ics technicians, in IT, or in the hotel and restaurant sector. Here, the IHK and BA are pri­marily responsible for attracting companies in Ger­many to the project and for supporting the integration of skilled workers. However, the AHKs are in charge of recruiting appro­priate skilled workers abroad. With the ZAV, the AHKs also support project participants with learning the German language and with the visa procedure.\n\nThe BMWK leads a pilot project for small and medium-sized skilled crafts companies called “Hand­werk bietet Zukunft (HabiZu)”, in cooperation with the German Confederation of Skilled Crafts (ZDH), the company sequa gGmbH and the ZAV. It aims to recruit 120 skilled craftsmen and women in electronics, metal construction and plant mechanics from Bosnia and Herzegovina for employment in Germany. Here too skilled workers are chosen by the BA in close cooperation with professional associations and Cham­bers of Crafts, not by employers. Certain federal states are also responding to labour shortages and developing their own pilot projects. In collaboration with the West German Chamber of Crafts and BA, the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia is recruiting skilled workers from Jordan and Egypt for companies in the electronics and IT sectors, helping them to gain German-language qualifications and accompanying them towards vocational recognition.\n\nPilot projects in labour migration (Type 2) have been gaining in importance. The BMWi has been garnering experience in this area since 2012 with projects to recruit trainees from Vietnam for geriatric and health care. Since 2019 the ZAV has led the training project APAL (“Vocational Training Partnership with Latin America”) with El Salvador and since 2021 with Mexico. Here too people are recruited as trainees for the health sector, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute and PASCH schools in Mexico. The project is being implemented in close coordination with the AA.\n\nThere are also newer projects, such as the “THAMM” project overseen by the GIZ since 2019, which combined Type 1 and Type 2. To date, THAMM has recruited 278 people for employers in the hotel and restaurant sector, the commercial-technical indus­try and electronics, sanitation, heating and plumbing, including 234 trainees and 44 skilled work­ers (as of October 2022). The project, which was commissioned by the BMZ and is co-financed by the EU, aims to establish cooperation with national em­ploy­ment agencies in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nLong-term projects can open up migration corridors for private recruiters.\n\nExperience demonstrates that long-term projects such as THAMM only recruit low numbers in the first few years. However, they can open up migration cor­ridors for private recruiters, as shown by the model projects funded by the then-BMWi for recruiting trainees from Vietnam for geriatric and healthcare. They led to two follow-up projects by private recruit­ers: one by Vivantes, which extended recruitment for geriatric care to Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, the Philippines and Kosovo, and the GIZ project “Triple Win Nurses – Recruiting Trainees from Viet Nam”, through which the GIZ together with the ZAV and the Viet­namese labour ministry recruited care trainees for Germany on behalf of hospitals and care homes.\n\nAmong the newest approaches are Type 3 projects inspired by the concept of “Global Skill Partnerships” (GSP), which aim to be highly beneficial for countries of origin and the migrants themselves (see Info box 5). The “Global Skill Partnerships” project has been im­ple­mented since 2021 on behalf of the BMG and the Bertelsmann Foundation to prepare care workers from Mexico and the Philippines linguistically and vocationally for the German labour market. To this end, existing training courses in these countries are being developed with the participation of University Hospital Bonn to meet the requirements of German care qualifications. The courses will be open not only to students who intend to go to Germany after quali­fying but all students in situ (“home track”). Just how high the standards of these projects are was shown by the GIZ project funded by the BMZ, “Creat­ing employment perspectives for youth in Kosovo” , which was also intended to open up job opportunities in construction in Kosovo and Germany. The project’s GSP-like component was not implemented because the gap in quality standards was ultimately too wide to be bridged during the timespan. However, during the project a replicable model was developed for skills development and for the recognition of Kosovar and German professions with a shortage of skilled work­ers; a pilot project was also designed that could be implemented in future in the construction sector.\n\nSince 2019 there has also been the GIZ programme PAM, financed by the BMZ, which builds on the les­sons learned from the Kosovo project and other GIZ measures. PAM together with actors from the public and private sectors and civil society develops and tests mobility models between Germany and partner coun­tries Ecuador (trainees for industrial mechanics and electronics for industrial engineering), Nigeria (trainees for the construction sector), Kosovo (construction trainees and skilled workers in early education) and Vietnam (skilled workers in machining mechanics).\n\nTo promote the development potential of the EU Talent Partnerships stipulated in the EU asylum and migration pact, the BMZ and the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) have started the two-year pilot initiative “INSPIRE”. The project will create country-specific multi-stakeholder plat­forms for dialogue on GSPs to bring together public and private actors from Europe and partner countries. The project is being implemented in the Eastern Part­nership region, the Western Balkans and Africa.\n\nNon-state recruitment projects\n\nIn addition to state-funded projects, there are many projects organised by non-state actors: internal com­pany programmes and projects initiated by educational establishments, church charities, non-profits or foundations which are partly financed by the state and implemented in close cooperation with the BA and GIZ.\n\nMany training initiatives by German employers already exist in the private sector, especially by glob­ally active companies, which tend to train workers for their own needs and up to German vocational stand­ards on a production site abroad. For instance, Porsche has established its own training centres for mechatronics technicians in South Africa and the Philippines, whose graduates can be employed world­wide in Porsche subsidiaries (elements of Type 3).\n\nSince SMEs often depend on support from chambers and professional bodies for recruitment, the District Skilled Crafts Association Fleischer-Innung in Lörrach and the Chamber of Crafts Freiburg have set up the pilot project “Von Indien nach Südbaden – Azubis für das Handwerk” (From India to southern Baden – Trainees for Skilled Crafts). As part of this project, workers are recruited in India to be trained as butcher’s shop assistants or butchers for butcher’s shops in the Lörrach district (Type 2). An Indian recruit­ment agency recruits young people in situ and pre­pares them for training in Germany through inten­sive language courses. Participants have to bear the costs for the German course and supervision by the Indian recruitment agency; German businesses pay travel costs and provide accommodation.\n\nWelfare organisations also implement projects. They mostly focus on finding young people abroad for vocational training in Germany in health and geriatric care. For example, as part of a training pro­gramme by Württemberg Social Work and Welfare, since 2014 over 18 welfare and charitable organisations from the Land Baden-Württemberg have been recruiting young people from Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Serbia, Ukraine and Armenia for a three-year training programme in Germany (Type 2). The project costs are largely paid by the future employers.\n\nSince 2014, the Bertelsmann Foundation has been intensively working on transnational skills and mobil­ity partnerships (of Type 3) as part of the project ”Making Fair Migration A Reality”. For instance, it initiated, along with the GIZ, the BMG project “Global Skill Partnerships”, mentioned above, with Mexico and the Philippines. It is also currently building a plat­form for German actors from politics, the econo­my and civil society to exchange their knowledge and experience to jointly identify obstacles to the imple­mentation and expansion of such projects in areas with severe skilled-worker shortages and to develop solutions.\n\nState and non-state actors do not yet cooperate sufficiently at crucial interfaces.\n\nIn sum, the state and non-state actors responsible for recruiting workers from third countries for Germany are not yet sufficiently working together at several important interfaces. Good progress has been made on an ad-hoc basis in the federal government’s migra­tion policy coordination; however, there lacks a whole-of-government approach that also considers development and foreign-policy aspects of attracting labour migrants to Germany. This lack of coherence is also clear in the many, somewhat parallel pilot projects for in training and labour migration to Ger­many that are being carried out by various ministries with partner countries. In turn, the expertise on suc­cessful approaches to recruiting skilled workers and trainees from third countries is often held by the GIZ, which participates in almost all state recruitment programmes. This experience should be used more extensively to develop and expand programmes. It is also important to strengthen the BA’s capacities to approve employment and to negotiate bilateral recruit­ment agreements. A coherent recruitment strategy must also pay more attention to the perspec­tive of non-state recruiters, especially employers and trade unions as well as the diaspora and NGOs, in order to be successful.\n\nProblem Areas and Recommended Actions\n\nRecognising Foreign Vocational Experience\n\nThe recognition of qualifications and migrants’ language skills continue to be deterrents to recruitment. Recognition procedures frequently take too long and lead to many third-country nationals being excluded from the German labour market.\n\nThe German labour-market and vocational system is highly formalised. The recruitment and approval of third-country nationals is usually only possible if foreign qualifications are recognised as being equiva­lent to German standards. Moreover, the recogition procedure is time-consuming and cost-intensive. Increasingly, actors from the economy, politics and academia are calling for a more flexible approach to the criterion of vocational equivalence (or even its abolition).\n\nNew approaches are being explored. Thus the Fed­eral Institute for Vocational Education and Train­ing (BIBB) and the Bertelsmann Foundation have long been working on instruments for registering potential and skills, and propose new procedures for recog­nising skills gained informally. The federal gov­ern­ment announced in its white paper that it intended to simplify the recognition procedures for foreign edu­ca­tional and vocational qualifications in coordination with the Länder and chambers, inter alia by extend­ing the range of support and qualifications.\n\nSome problems in recognising foreign qualifi­ca­tions result from a lack of prequalification and pre-integration support. These deficits are not new either: improvements to (digital) information opportunities for future labour migrants have been discussed for many years. The information currently on offer – for instance via the Internet portal “Make it in Ger­many” – is clearly insufficient and too strongly geared towards skilled workers to attract larger num­bers of workers that might migrate to Germany. It is problematic that there is no central Internet portal for workers of all qualification levels and for those interested in training.\n\nChambers and associations are also responsible for recognising qualifications. Under the Professional Qualifications Assessment Act (BQFG), chambers are the appropriate authority for verifying equivalence for (semi) skilled jobs in the dual system (unregulated occupations) as well as for the occupations they have been assigned: the regional Chambers of Crafts are responsible for skilled crafts, while the central IHK Foreign Skills Approval (IHK FOSA) is responsible for the more than 250 IHK-regulated training occupa­tions. However, the chambers and associations could become more active and support the employ­ment services by supplying well-conceived assess­ments of practical experience and professional skills. It should be pointed out that training systems in other countries are not necessarily worse, but often simply different. Often German employment services have insufficient knowledge of them. A further prob­lem is that exisiting job offers have so far not been considered sufficient proof of the required qualifi­cations.\n\nLanguage Skills\n\nAs a rule, potential labour migrants have to prove that they possess adequate language skills. This is often a barrier to migration. Yet according to the first results of an OECD online survey of almost 30,000 inter­national skilled workers, the latter are very will­ing (3 out of 5 participants) to learn German before­hand. More participants would be willing if the range of courses was improved, the cost of courses was lowered or more courses were offered.\n\nThe federal government also considers language training before entry to be an important element of pre-integration that is supposed to prepare migrants in general for life in Germany. As part of revising the National Action Plan for Integration (NAP-I), the federal government’s commissioner for migration, refugees and integration carried out a poll at federal and state level as well as among civil society about the pre-integration support on offer. Results indicate that while there are many language courses, includ­ing for skilled workers and migrant trainees from third countries, these are mostly limited to only cer­tain countries of origin and cover neither wide geo­graphical areas nor the demand. Moreover, there is a large number and wide spectrum of actors. According to the poll, what is required is better networking be­tween actors, trying out new approaches to pre-inte­gration and an expansion of model projects to addi­tional target groups and countries and regions of origin.\n\nThe NAP-I points out how important it is to better coordinatelanguage courses in countries of origin with those offered in Germany, advance the training and recruitment of German-language teachers abroad, support the Support Initiative for German Schools Abroad and Partner Schools (BIDS) to prepare migrants for studying at university in Germany, and strengthen German as a foreign language in the state school sys­tems of countries of origin. As a matter of principle, language acquisition in the country of origin shoud be expanded. Within the German government, the AA is responsible for this. According to NAP-I, closer cooperation would be necessary between the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the Goethe Institute, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the Educational Exchange Service (PAD).\n\nThe key actor in language acquisition abroad is – and will continue to be for the foreseeable future – the Goethe Institute, which has moreover been in­volved in providing qualifications and advice for spouses and skilled workers from other EU member states and third countries. The Institute is present in all relevant target regions for skilled labour initiatives and offers, together with public and private part­ners, language and intercultural qualifications. Because of its many sites in Germany and abroad, the Goethe Institute is an actor which can accompany workers throughout the whole migration and integra­tion process, from qualifying in the country of origin to further training in Germany.\n\nHowever, the institute has neither sufficient money nor sufficient staff, despite an AA funding increase of €15.1 million (to €239 m), agreed in 2023. There is also room for improvement in linking digital and ana­logue courses and coordinating programmes taught abroad with those taught in Germany. More­over, language courses are often only available at the Goethe Institute itself and there are too few in gen­eral; there is insufficient cooperation with local lan­guage course providers.\n\nThe goals of language acquisition are also inad­equately defined. To increase recruitment, workers should be supported in acquiring German skills to level A2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) even before they migrate. This will require pre-vocational language courses in sufficient numbers, of appropriate length, at reasonable cost and with easy accessibility. Strengthening language teaching must also include training the required additional teachers, making more extensive use of digital teaching methods and ensuring that venues for face-to-face teaching, which is frequently still indispensable in the country of origin, are large enough.\n\nVisa Policy\n\nMost third-country nationals need a visa to enter Germany. To obtain one, they usually need to provide proof of a firm job offer or a place on a training or degree course. The issuing of visas is often lengthy, with substantial waiting-times. Nevertheless, there are significant variations by site, due to the inad­equate staffing levels of many embassies and con­sulates. The federal government itself has accepted that, to increase staff numbers in visa processing for skilled workers, it will need to recruit and train more visa decision-makers, enlarge exisiting sites and pro­vide more resources for employing local workers; it has announced that it is trying to address all three shortages. External providers, which are allowed to take on certain visa-processing services under Art 43 of the EU Visa Code, are increasingly important. According to the AA, they already accept over 85 per cent of applications for short-term Schengen visas, but only 34 per cent of long-term national visas. The latter could be expanded and thus relieve the embassies and consulates.\n\nThe German Foreign Office oversees visa issuing with support from the Federal Office of Administration (BVA) and Federal Agency for Foreign Affairs (BfAA). The BVA checks all visa applications, is the communications and services interface between Ger­man missions abroad and a multitude of German authorities and is supposed to coordinate the digitali­sation of applications. The BfAA is responsible for processing visa applications for skilled workers under the FEG. The new federal agency should contribute to easing the burden of visa sections abroad. It remains to be seen whether this new administrative structure contributes to accelerating visa procedures for skilled workers and their family members – also because recruiting the agency’s staff is a challenge.\n\nResearchers and NGOs often criticise consulates for having a negative attitude to migration, being restric­tive in their issuing of visas and having a “defensive mentality”. This reproach is relevant for recruit­ment because many countries of origin (such as Tur­key) nowadays make their cooperation in controlling migration dependent on their demands for simplified international mobility being met – for instance through free visas or a generalised visa waiver for their citizens. Turkey has been pushing for visa-free travel with the EU for a long time.\n\nIn fact, according to the European Commision, in 2021 EU member state embassies and consulates received 2.9 m applications for Schengen visas, of which 2.4 m were granted. In the same period, around 350,000 applications for Schengen visas were made in German representations, of which 288,000 were granted. In both cases, the rejection rate was about 17 per cent. However, these figures present an incomplete picture since they only take into account processed visa applications. The number of inter­rupted visa applications or applications that were not even begun because they were thought hopeless is far higher. Neither appear in the statistics.\n\nThe federal government has announced that it will build on the framework cooperation agreement between the AA and DIHK by identifying additional sites where AHKs can provide advice to applicants before the visa procedure and support them in pre­paring their applications. It also said that it might assume a greater role as an intermediary between potential workers and employers and in advising Ger­man companies. Moreover, the processing time for visa applications is to be reduced to three months, among other things by hiring additional staff.\n\nAdministrative Infrastructure in Germany\n\nThe government should push ahead with digitalising the issuing of visas; however, this is insufficient by itself since it presupposes digitalising its cooperation with Foreigners’ Offices. The latter often still use analogue working methods. There are also frequent complaints about the sluggishness of administrative structures and inadequate staffing. Foreigners’ Offices are crucial here since they are responsible for enforc­ing residency legislation. Their tasks include deciding on residence and permanent residence permits; they are also involved in the issuing of visas and related other duties. However, even during business-as-usual Foreigners’ Offices are already underequipped for their mission. This has only worsened with forced displacement from Ukraine and the implementation of the Skilled Immigration Act and the Residence Act. In an SWR poll of August 2022, 94 per cent of agency heads surveyed stated that their staffing situation was strained, that they had too few applicants, rooms and posts, and that employees were underpaid. As a con­sequence, they said, decisions took longer and longer. It currently takes Foreigners’ Officesthree to twelve months to process applications.\n\nThe FEG stipulates the establishment of Central Foreigners’ Officein the Länder (§ 71 Residence Act). However, to date only nine have put this into prac­tice. In addition, there are around 540 local Foreigners’ Offices, which necessitates time-consuming co­ordination between them and with other authorities and can even lead to multiple assessments with dif­ferent results. The ZAV will also require more staff if future recruitment is not to be exclusively in the hands of private agencies. Information channels typi­cally favoured by those interested in immigration, such as social media, should also be used more.\n\nWhole-of-Government Approach\n\nRecruitment is an overarching political task requir­ing, among other things, orderly teamwork between the relevant ministries. Despite recent reforms, Ger­many’s migration policy is still a long way from this ideal. Coordination is currently primarily event-driven, for instance by the steeering meeting of the secretaries of state to elaborate the white paper for skilled labour immigration from third countries.\n\nThe most important condition for an efficient recruit­ment policy is continuous cooperation be­tween departments. The relevant departments must come to an agreement on the government’s objectives for migration and refugee policy as part of a whole-of-government approach. This includes the “special rep­resentative of the German federal government for migration partnerships with third countries” nomi­nated by the coalition government in February 2023.\n\nThe whole-of-government approach should be com­plemented by a whole-of-society approach by regu­larly involving civil society (including the diaspora), the private sector, and regional and local actors.\n\nDevelopment impacts of recruitment\n\nAs in most other industrial countries, migration policy has in Germany over time been strongly influenced by interior and security policy; it has looked primarily inwards, often at reducing irregular immigration and improving and accelerating the integration of immi­grants. By comparison, labour-market, foreign-policy and development aspects were secondary.\n\nThe current federal government wants to change this. In their coalition agreement of November 2021, the ruling parties already agreed on a “new beginning” in migration and integration policy that would do jus­tice “to a modern immigration country”. The future policy aims at implementing practicable partnership agreements with important countries of origin and will, as additionally stated in the white paper, avoid “poaching” workers from development partner coun­tries in a way that inhibits develop­ment.\n\nA promising new approach here are the current plans of the BMZ for so-called “migration and devel­opment centres”. These will in part build on experi­ence with existing “advice centres for jobs, migration and re-integration”, which were established by the BMZ under the previous government as part of the Perspektive Heimat (“Returning to New Opportuni­ties”) programme. However, the new centres will be fundamentally re-aligned so as to synchronise with the adminstrative structures of the partnership coun­tries, for instance their ministries of work or migra­tion, and enable later adoption by those structures. They should also integrate the private sector and NGOs; allow other donor countries to participate financially; work with organisations that are active in situ in lan­guage teaching and vocational qualifications; and support women in particular.\n\nThe centres are confronted with many expectations. They are to advise those wanting to migrate and work legally in Germany or other countries as well as re­turnees requiring help with re-integration in their coun­try of origin. They are also to find suitable language and orientation courses for migrants who already have a job contract or work visa, and voca­tional and qualification programmes for people interested in migrating. Furthermore, the centres are to support job creation in the partner country, help returnees set up a business where applicable and offer psychological and social support to vulnerable groups. Finally, they are to strengthen the partner country’s administrative capacities, for instance the employment agencies responsible. In general, the part­ner country is also meant to benefit from this support at the local and civil-society level.\n\nFuture debate on this approach will need to clarify above all the extent to which these centres are also meant to take on recruitment tasks without contra­dicting the development mandate of the BMZ. It will also need to be decided which NGOs, diaspora orga­nisations, companies and other actors the centres should cooperate with. These issues will be decisive in making the new approach a real alternative to current offices focusing on return policy.\n\nSelecting partner countries and recruitment agreements\n\nSelecting partner countries is a key – and therefore controversial – aspect of labour-migration policy. Thus the BA has provided support by establishing a demand analysis for recruitment abroad and a poten­tial analysis to identify suitable partner countries. The process has so far found 12 “high-potential partner countries”. The BA expects that the practical experi­ence made with new recruitment projects will create new insights for shaping recruitment agreements and other forms of bilateral cooperation in recruitment.\n\nSuch potential analyses can be politically tricky and can potentially cause bilateral tensions. The BA’s analyses are therefore only used for the government’s internal planning. According to the BMAS, they are a good basis for approaching specific countries and making them well-conceived cooperation proposals. The ministry has also repeatedly pointed out that poten­tial analyses do not exclude other third coun­tries from migration cooperation, if they fulfilthe legal basis for labour immigration. Development circles primarily criticise the potential analyses car­ried out to date for inadequately involving actors and perspectives from foreign and development policy.\n\nThe selection of partner countries also raises fun­damental questions: by definition, bilateral partner­ships require country-specific approaches. However, the legal basis of Germany’s labour-migration policy is universal in nature and focused on meritocratic selection; in other words, migration opportunities are primarily dependent on the qualifications, not the provenance, of individual applicants. This has been changed to some degree by the Western Balkans Regulation, but if more country particularism were to arise, this could generate tensions with the legal foundations of German migration policy.\n\nAnother problem of the current selection of part­ner countries is that it does not respond to criticism, for instance from trade unions and NGOs, or the posi­tions of the potential partner countries. However, factoring these positions in would help the federal government to develop principles for a well accepted recruitment policy.\n\nIn the past, there were also often objections to recruiting in African countries, with reference to the particular consequences of recruiting skilled health workers from already weak health systems and to vio­lations of the ILO principles as formulated, for exam­ple, in the “Fair Recruitment Initiative”. However, such objections tended to be formulated less vehe­mently against recruitment from Asian countries, often based on claims that countries such as the Phil­ippines (already an export hub for care workers), Indo­nesia (the BA’s first recruitment agreement under the FEG) and India (recruitment agreement in Decem­ber 2021 with the state-run partner agency Norka Roots for Kerala state) possessed not only surplus workers but also suitable administrative structures to ensure cooperation. Similar arguments come from recruiters who point out that large companies which actively recruit workers from third countries prefer Asian states – including for practical reasons, since they often already have subsidiaries there who can provide support in recruitment. Recruiters also indi­cate that companies are markedly less interested in the African continent, recruiting to any significant extent only in South Africa, Nigeria and North Afri­can countries, such as Egypt.\n\nAll relevant interest groups – employer confederations, research institutes and training centres in situ, IHKs and AHKs, certifying bodies and embassies – should be taken into account. This is a key to fairer migration. The “Joint Monitoring Committee” for im­plementing the GIZ “Triple Win” project should serve as a model here – it involves the trade unions, ZAV, GIZ and relevant ministries of the partner regions.\n\nThe different interests and conflicting objectives of labour-market policy and development cooperation are evident when it comes to recruitment agreements. BMAS employees point out that recruitment arrange­ments between the BA and the labour ministries and employment agencies in partner countries should be flanked by development policy. However, it is unclear how this can be realised, given that the BA is not a development organisation. It requires the support of the BMZ, which is by default not primarily focused on domestic policy goals but the development perspec­tives for partner countries. Some commentators say that the BMZ’s existing country knowledge should be used when developing recruitment agreements in order to ensure mutual benefit in designing partner­ships. In general, they believe, development aspects are not sufficiently integrated into Germanys recruit­ment policy.\n\nTaking African countries into consideration for new recruitment agreements would offer Germany the opportunity of further extending its pioneering role in partnership and development approaches to labour migration, and rallying support for such an approach at EU level as well. These aspects should be considered when designing the planned centres for migration and development.\n\nTransitioning from Pilot Projects to Long-term Recruitment Measures\n\nIt is almost impossible to assess the economic or labour market implications of Germany’s pilot projects due to the low case numbers. There are certainly promising practices stemming from pilot projects but most of them do not lead to larger programmes. One exception is the GIZ “Triple Win” programme, which has existed since 2013. Most others never went beyond pilot-project status. One reason is that they tend to be demanding, expensive and difficult to implement, especially in the initial phase. Nevertheless, projects exist that would be suitable for scaling-up, such as the PAM and THAMM projects described above.\n\nOne reason for problems in scaling is that there is not yet a sustained financing mechanism for fair recruitment programmes. In particular, it is not clear how projects like transnational skill and mobility partnerships could be funded by the private sector. While it is both necessary and logical to draw on resources from development cooperation for the start-up financing of pilot projects, in the long term (co-)financing using public funds cannot be justified – after all, recruitment is not only about securing the nation’s labour volume as a foundation of economic competetiveness but also about the commercial interests of businesses. Ultimately, conflicting objectives between labour-market policy and development cooperation become evident here too – as does the fact that pilot projects can help to establish positive standards for recruitment from third countries.\n\nA way out of these conflicting objectives could be the early involvement of employers in state-run projects, for instance through private public partnerships. Another financing possibility is for the private sector to fund fair recruitment actors. The “Labor Migration Partnerships”, an initiative founded by several businesses, proposes three models for this: (1) philanthropic institutions provide pre-financing at affordable interest rates to recruitment actors who meet certain quality standards. (2) Larger employers offer recruitment actors affordable pre-financing for fair recruitment of the workers that they need. (3) Investors fund recruitment actors who are already involved in fair recruitment, allowing them to intensify and scale their recruitment efforts.\n\nMeasures against Unfair Recruitment Practices\n\nRecruitment by non-state actors can pose particular challenges to labour migrants and the influence of development actors on them is so far limited. There is also a knowledge gap: research (at least in Germany) has so far primarily concentrated on state actors and given less attention to the role of non-state actors. Nevertheless a number of insights can be derived from the informal conversations carried out for this paper on the relationship between state and private-sector recruitment to Germany and about possible measures against unfair practices:\n\nResearch shows that in Germany it is hard for SMEs because they do not possess the international net­works, staff infrastructure or knowledge of third countries in order to actively recruit potential workers abroad.\n\nRecruitment via state structures is often expensive because certain standards have to be adhered to, e.g. avoding recruitment fees to be borne by labour migrants. In this context, it often seems more convenient for employers to hire private recruit­ment actors, since they then do not have to follow the principles of fair recruitment (such as “the employer pays)”.\n\nTrade unions have argued (for example with refer­ence to German recruitment of careworkers from the Philippines) that greater numbers of skilled workers could have been hired if there had been no parallel private-sector recruitment, who are often more agile. The Philippines, they claim, did not provide the agreed contingent of care workers, whereas the number of non-state-recruited workers rose. According to this perspective, state recruit­ment should be the rule and cooperation with pri­vate recruitment agencies the exception – and only if they have obtained an official quality seal for adhering to the principles of fair recruit­ment.\n\nThis claim is based on reports that workers recruited by non-state actors tend more often to be exploited. They point to the large grey market in the out­patient care sector, which is extremely hard to over­see or regulate compared to hospitals and retire­ment or care homes. Working conditions, they say, are sometimes miserable, pay is often bad and the care workers are unprotected against their em­ployers’ abuses and whims. Research shows that many care workers from internal EU migration are very dependent on their employers, that recruit­ment fees are often unconscionably high and that care workers have to accept high repayment obli­gations – e.g. in the event of failed exams. Overall, it seems, low-qualified workers are hardest hit by exploitation.\n\nResearch shows that there are different promising models in reducing exploitative recruitment practices that combine regulation through state measures, mar­ket incentives and the participation of trade unions and civil society. In this way, companies can also be strongly incentivised to become involved in better and more gender-equal working conditions. This pro­cess could be facilitated by additional targeted meas­ures to support female workers in the labour market and immigration, including through help with family and job compatibility (e.g. child care) and language and further training.\n\nInternational Standards for Fair Recruitment\n\nThere have long been debates in the forums of global migration policy processes – such as the Global Forum for Migration and Development – about fair recruitment. These always call for improving inter­national cooperation to prevent migrant workers from being burdened with recruitment fees, which can lead to long-term debt and problematic relationships of dependence. The UN’s 2018 Global Com­pact for Migration addresses this issue as Objective 6 under the heading, “facilitate fair and ethical recruit­ment and safeguard conditions that ensure decent work”.\n\nThe first steps towards voluntary codes of conduct in fair recruitment stem from the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD). The UN High Level Dialogue on development and migration agreed in 2013 to develop global standards for recruitment practices for migrant workers, which has led to dif­ferent – and partly competing – initiatives by the ILO and IOM. In 2014 the ILO started an initiative on fair recruitment (ILO-FAIR) and in 2016, in nego­tiation with governments, unions and employers, it developed the (non-binding) “General Principles and Operational Guidelines for Fair Recruitment”. In turn, in 2014 the IOM along with the International Organi­sation of Employers (IOE) devised principles of ethical recruitment and founded the International Recruitment Integrity System (IRIS). This is a set of standards for private recruitment actors, for which certification has been available since 2018. In 2020, as part of the first ever international conference on this topic, the IOM also developed its own guidelines for fair recruit­ment, the so-called Montreal Recommendations, which aim to improve oversight on the private recruit­ment industry.\n\nOther regulatory instruments are also important for cooperation on recruitment, such as the code of conduct of the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the recruitment of international skilled health work­ers. It calls on member states to provide support for building the appropriate framework conditions for development, for access to qualification measures and for the transfer of knowledge and technology regard­ing the migration of skilled health workers."
