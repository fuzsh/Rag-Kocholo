The meeting will convene expert presenters and seek public input on evidence-based solutions for increasing the affordability, availability, and convenience of nutrient-dense foods for infants and children six months to two years of age, providing adequate safety nets for families most vulnerable to early childhood malnutrition, and engaging across systems to deliver on the global commitment to “feed a fragile world”.\n\nThe meeting will be held at the Iowa Event Center, 730 3rd Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309 on October 19, 2022 from 7:00–8:45 am Central Time. Members of the public are invited to join in person; the link to register to attend in person at the Iowa Event Center is here. The meeting will also be live streamed via ZOOM for virtual public participation; the link to register to participate virtually can be found in this link.\n\nToday, nearly two in three children ages six months to two years are not consuming nutritionally adequate diets critical to growth and development. Although 9.2 percent of the global population lives below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day, the average cost of a nutrient-adequate diet for one child in a low-income country is $1–2 per day at six to eight months, $1 per day at nine to 11 months, and above $1 per day at one year and older. Simply put, families are struggling to afford safe and nutritious food for their young children, posing threats to child survival and irreversible consequences for child cognitive and physical growth. Sub-country-level data indicate early childhood malnutrition does not equally impact all families, socio-economic groups, communities, or regions, with the poor accessing and consuming too-few important sources of nutrition—including animal-source foods and nutrient-dense vegetables—during the complementary-feeding stage, a critical transition when an infant’s need for energy and nutrients starts to exceed what is provided by breast milk, and complementary foods are necessary to meet those needs.\n\nPresentations and discussion will focus on the following questions: 1) What does a nutritionally balanced food basket for infants and young children look like, and what would it cost? 2) What are evidence-based priority actions to reduce the costs of balanced food baskets, improve nutrient content and safety, incentivize use by improving convenience and enabling caregivers, and provide financial means for the most vulnerable to access them through safety nets? 3) How do we achieve coordinated, gender-transformative change across the food, health, and social protection systems in both development and humanitarian (emergency) settings? Drawing from testimony by global experts and practitioners, BIFAD will advise the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on recommended policy and program actions. The meeting will include a public comment period from 8:25 to 8:40 am Central Time. Please find an agenda for the event in this link.\n\nThe BIFAD is a seven-member, presidentially appointed advisory board to USAID established in 1975 under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act, as amended, to ensure that USAID brings the assets of U.S. universities to bear on development challenges in agriculture, nutrition, and food security and supports their representation in USAID programming.\n\nFor questions about registration, please contact the BIFAD Support Team at: bifadsupport@tetratech.com.\n\nFor questions about BIFAD, or to submit written comments, evidence, or materials in advance or following the meeting, please contact Clara Cohen, Designated Federal Officer for BIFAD in the Bureau for Resilience and Food Security at USAID.

Public input is sought to: 1) identify leverage points across agricultural, food, and nutrition systems (e.g., financial, production, innovation, market, nutrition, risk management, early warning, and humanitarian systems) for transformative change and scaling climate finance to achieve the targets and intermediate results of the USAID Climate Strategy, 2022–2030 and the U.S. Government’s Global Food Security Strategy, 2022–2026; 2) identify enabling systems and conditions that support transformational economic, social, governance, essential services, or humanitarian capacities; and 3) prioritize areas of USAID action areas to facilitate transformative systemic change that is inclusive of underrepresented populations and promotes gender equity and equality. The public is also invited to comment on the subcommittee’s work and to submit names of experts, case studies, evidence, and relevant publications to inform the study.\n\nBIFAD Launches Subcommittee on Systemic Solutions for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Agriculture, Nutrition, and Food Systems\n\nSummary: Launched in June 2022 by the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD) and the U.S. Agency for International Food and Agricultural Development (USAID), the subcommittee will lead transdisciplinary evidence gathering to advise BIFAD with independent recommendations to improve USAID programming and strategies. The subcommittee is envisioned to support USAID's role in accelerating systems change and transformative climate change adaptation and mitigation approaches in agriculture, food systems and nutrition, and in targeting climate finance to benefit smallholder farmers. Subcommittee members bring a breadth of expertise across disciplines, diversity of views, and organizational perspectives to tackle the greatest challenge to food security. The subcommittee members' bios can be found here.\n\nFor more information on the subcommittee's activities, visit the Climate Change Subcommittee USAID page here.\n\nSign Up for Updates on this and other BIFAD activities at this link: https://bit.ly/3bn4dfG\n\nUSAID Administrator Samantha Power Recognizes Service of Former Members of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)\n\nMay 23, 2022\n\nIn opening remarks at the public meeting of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD) on May 23, 2022, Feed the Future Global Coordinator and Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development Samantha Power recognized BIFAD members whose committee terms recently ended. Administrator Power and Bureau for Resilience and Food Security Assistant to the Administrator Jim Barnhart thanked outgoing members for their dedicated service and extraordinary commitment, which have enabled BIFAD to play a lead role across the U.S. Government and to assure the highest scientific standards in global agriculture and food security.\n\nOutgoing BIFAD members are appreciated for generously giving their time and expertise in service to USAID. BIFAD recommendations have informed USAID decision making in the areas of resilience, nutrition, youth employment, and food security in conflict-affected environments. When COVID-19 struck in 2020, BIFAD swiftly convened global experts and practitioners to inform USAID programming on the food security and nutrition impacts of the pandemic and to advise on promising responses.\n\nBIFAD’s in-depth studies continue to influence USAID decision making and strategies. These include a study carried out under former BIFAD Chair Dr. Brady Deaton’s leadership that helped establish the transition of U.S. university-led Collaborative Research Support Programs to Feed the Future Innovation Labs and a study to inform the sustainability and impact of strategic human and institutional capacity development investments to advance the goals of the Feed the Future programs. Under former BIFAD Chair Dr. Mark Keenum’s leadership, two studies have been influential: How the United States Benefits from Agricultural and Food Security Investments in Developing Countries and Agricultural Productivity Growth, Resilience, and Economic Transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for USAID, which helped to inform the 2022 revisions to the U.S. Government Global Food Security Strategy.\n\nDr. Laurence Alexander, current BIFAD Chair and Chancellor of the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, echoed USAID’s appreciation for former BIFAD members, saying, “Your vision and work have contributed greatly to USAID’s strategic direction and program implementation, and we look forward to building on this legacy.”\n\nView the full announcement at this link.\n\n184th BIFAD Public Meeting\n\nThe Global Food Security Crisis: Exploring the Evidence Base and Lessons from the Past to Strengthen Agricultural, Nutrition, and Food Systems in the Face of Shocks\n\n23 May 2022 (Online, 12:00-2:30 PM EDT)\n\nPublic comment from 1:30–1:50 pm EDT and from 2:15–2:20 pm EDT\n\nThis is a public meeting of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), The Global Food Security Crisis: Exploring the Evidence Base and Lessons from the Past to Strengthen Agricultural, Nutrition, and Food Systems in the Face of Shocks. The BIFAD is a seven-member, presidentially appointed advisory board to USAID established in 1975 under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act, as amended, to ensure that USAID brings the assets of U.S. universities to bear on development challenges in agriculture and food security and supports their representation in USAID programming. This will be the first public meeting of BIFAD members appointed by President Joseph Biden on January 14, 2022 and will include an introduction to newly appointed BIFAD members, a briefing on BIFAD’s current work plan priorities, and an overview of key upcoming initiatives. BIFAD will also announce new work relating to systemic solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agricultural, nutrition, and food systems to inform the implementation of the recently released USAID Climate Strategy 2022–2030.\n\nIn the face of short-term and long-term shocks, fragile food systems are driving increases in poverty, hunger, and child stunting. The global effort to end hunger and poverty is at a critical moment, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine adding to an already-compounded global food crisis as countries struggle to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, humanitarian emergencies, and climate change. What does it mean to get ahead of future crises and to build resilient food systems? What are the lessons learned from previous crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2007–2008 global food price crisis? BIFAD will take stock of evidence around these questions and identify weak links in food systems that must be strengthened to respond to global food security crises and to mitigate the impacts of current and future shocks. Food systems, nutrition, and humanitarian assistance experts will share lessons learned about resilience in the face of these disruptions. Evidence-based recommendations from these deliberations will inform USAID strategy implementation, policy, and programming.\n\nPublic comment is invited to further inform BIFAD’s work.\n\nLearn more and view the full agenda.\n\nRegister to attend: https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_vCZ3oZYDTAyEEcq14OwKIA\n\nAgricultural Research and Development: Essential to Accelerate Progress and Recovery Towards Inclusive Agricultural Transformation in Africa\n\nFebruary 21, 2022 - A new podcast episode of the African Green Revolution Forum 2021 (AGRF2021) series features key findings of the BIFAD-commissioned report, Agricultural Productivity Growth, Resilience, and Economic Transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for USAID, and a discussion among panelists from Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa about necessary actions for accelerating progress and recovery toward inclusive agricultural transformation in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe essential role of agricultural research and development for productivity-led agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa emerged as a clear theme throughout the episode.\n\nPodcast moderator, Agnes Asiimwe Konde, Vice President for Program Innovation and Delivery at AGRA, and lead author of the report, Thom Jayne, Professor Emeritus at Michigan State University and Advisor to the President of the African Development Bank, discuss key findings of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD)-commissioned study. Agricultural production growth has been a major driver of economic transformation in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 20 years and is linked to notable improvements across other development indicators in health, education, and government effectiveness. However, this productivity growth is primarily attributable to land area expansion—a concerning trend considering environmental costs of deforestation and biodiversity loss. Pointing to several cases in Africa and Asia, countries that invest substantially in agricultural research, development, and extension (R&D&E) have achieved more rapid productivity growth rates. This growth is fostered through effective agricultural R&D&E systems, land tenure, finance, policy, infrastructure, market access, and other enabling environment factors that promote innovation and adoption of technologies and practices.\n\nResponding to these findings and reflecting upon their own research and experiences, panelists offer recommended actions to accelerate productivity-led growth—a few of which are summarized below.\n\nIncrease total government investment in agricultural research and development. Panelist Lulama Traub, Technical Committee Member for the Regional Network of Agricultural Policy Research Institutes (ReNAPRI; an African-led, regionally coordinated group of national agricultural policy research institutes), points to data suggesting that most African countries are spending well below 1% of agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) on agricultural research and development. Of the few countries spending 1% or greater of agricultural GDP in agricultural research and development (R&D), most measured positive annual growth in agricultural output with growth attributed to increased total farm productivity and input use, rather than through land expansion.\n\nCreate incentives and protect investments to capitalize private-sector investments in areas that are critical to productivity. Panelist Tosin Ojo, Vice President of the Sahel Group, encourages private sector-led research, with governments incentivizing and protecting private-sector investments in R&D. Panelists encourage capital investments in agricultural R&D that have great potential for return on investment and that respond to emerging challenges such as climate change adaptation and genetic potential for drought tolerance.\n\nOrganize and foster symbiotic partnerships between the private sector, governments, and research and higher education institutions. Wandile Sihlobo, Chief Economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, points to the value of public-private partnerships to leverage the capacities of partner organizations. Wandile’s examples highlight the role of universities and research institutions in identifying evidence-based policy recommendations, objectively advising both the private and public sectors.\n\nIn concluding remarks, study lead author Thom Jayne highlights three “ingredients” to building strong agricultural research and development in Africa: 1) strengthening partnerships and coordination between national research organizations and international research institutes, including the CGIAR system, 2) building the political will to support increased public investment in agricultural R&D; and 3) leveraging the staggering increase in human capital, including the 14-fold increase of youth attending post-secondary education in the past two decades, by incentivizing careers in agricultural research.\n\nListen to the podcast and share your comments and ideas here (Podcast Episode 17).\n\nNote: The views shared in this post and any shared resources are those of the author and speakers and do not necessarily reflect the formal opinion of USAID or BIFAD.\n\nNew Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD) Appointments\n\nOn January 14, 2022, President Biden announced his intent to appoint new members of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development. The Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD) is a seven-member, presidentially appointed advisory committee to USAID established in 1975 under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act to ensure that USAID brings the assets of U.S. universities to bear on development challenges in agriculture and food security and supports their representation in USAID programming.\n\nDr. Laurence B. Alexander, Chancellor of the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, has been appointed as BIFAD Chair along with new members: Dr. Marie Boyd, Associate Professor of Law at the University of South Carolina; Dr. Rattan Lal, 2020 World Food Prize Laureate, Distinguished University Professor of Soil Science, and Director of the Center for Carbon Management and Sequestration at The Ohio State University; Dr. Saweda Liverpool-Tasie, Associate Professor in the Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics at Michigan State University; Ms. Henri Moore, Vice President and Head of Responsible Business, GSK Consumer Health; and Ms. Kathy Spahn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Helen Keller International. The announcement also extends the appointment of Dr. Pamela Anderson, Director General Emerita of the International Potato Center.\n\nServing as thought leaders and conveners of diverse expert dialogues, the Board has recently provided evidence-based recommendations to USAID on protecting and advancing nutrition and food security outcomes during COVID-19 response and recovery; improving the agricultural sector and food security in conflict-affected and fragile contexts; and measuring the benefits of global agricultural development investment on the U.S economy. A newly published report commissioned by the Board puts forward a priority agenda for promoting economic transformation and resilience in the sub-Saharan region.\n\nThese new appointments position the Board to reflect the priorities of the new administration and continue to support USAID’s global commitments in agriculture and food systems through initiatives such as the revised US Government Global Food Security Strategy and U.S. Government Global Food Security Research Strategy; responding to climate change; expanding diversity, equity, and inclusion; and strengthening local systems. Dr. Alexander’s appointment as BIFAD Chair marks the first time the board is chaired by a leader of an 1890 public land grant university, acknowledging the valuable contributions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and presenting opportunity to further strengthen USAID’s partnerships with HBCUs and other U.S Minority Serving Institutions. USAID is proud to welcome the new BIFAD members, encouraged by the diversity and depth of expertise, organizations, and experience among the new members. We look forward to incorporating their deep expertise, input and energy to help advance USAID’s objectives in the important years to come.\n\nUSAID thanks outgoing members for giving generously of their time and talent and for their years of outstanding service, contributions, and support to BIFAD: Mark E. Keenum, BIFAD Chair & President, Mississippi State University; James M. Ash, Food & Agribusiness Group Leader, Husch Blackwell LLP; Gebisa Ejeta, Distinguished Professor, Purdue University; Richard L. Lackey, Chairman and CEO, World Food Bank Inc.; David Matthews, Business Development Officer, United Community Bank; and Mark McDaniel, Partner, McDaniel and McDaniel Attorneys, LLC.\n\n183rd BIFAD Public Meeting\n\nAgricultural Growth, Economic Transformation, and the Journey to Self-Reliance: Implications for USAID Programming\n\nOctober 13, 2020, 1:00 pm - 3:30 pm EDT (2.5 hours, virtual)\n\nTo see the agenda, click here.\n\nTo view the meeting recording, click here.\n\nTo see the meeting minutes, click here.\n\nA public meeting of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), Agricultural Growth, Economic Transformation, and the Journey to Self-Reliance: Implications for USAID Programming, was held on October 13, 2020 from 1:00 pm to 3:30 pm EDT. A public comment period took place from 3:00 to 3:20 pm, EDT. The meeting was livestreamed livestreamed via Zoom.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is reorienting its strategies, partnership models, and program practices to achieve greater development outcomes and strive toward a future where foreign assistance is no longer necessary. The approach, outlined in the Agency’s Policy Framework, emphasizes the concept of “self-reliance”—defined as the capacity and commitment of a country to plan, finance, and implement solutions to solve its own development challenges in an effective, inclusive, and accountable way.\n\nBIFAD convened the meeting to better understand the concept of economic transformation—how underdeveloped and agrarian-based countries shift from subsistence agriculture to a commercially oriented economy with diverse agricultural, manufacturing, and service sectors—and how it contributes to a country’s resilience to shocks, such as COVID-19, and its progression toward self-reliance. Authors of a BIFAD-commissioned study shared preliminary findings and lessons learned on emerging success stories in agricultural productivity-led economic transformation and discussed the implications of this evidence for USAID’s agricultural and food security development and social safety net priorities and programming.\n\nOn the basis of testimony, including public comments, shared at the meeting, BIFAD provided formal findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the Agency on best-bet operational and programmatic investments for catalyzing agricultural productivity and economic transformation.\n\n182nd BIFAD Public Meeting\n\nCOVID-19 and Nutrition: Impacts, Field Innovations, and the Way Forward\n\nSeptember 14, 2020, 10:00 am -12:30 pm EDT, 2.5 hours (virtual)\n\nTo view the agenda, click here.\n\nTo access a recording of the meeting, click here, using Zoom passcode 6f3YY$YJ.\n\nTo access minutes of the meeting, click here.\n\nTo see findings, conclusions, and recommendations from the meeting, click here.\n\nTo see the Agency response to BIFAD recommendations, click here.\n\nA public meeting of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), COVID-19 and Nutrition: Impacts, Field Innovations, and the Way Forward was held on September 14, 2020 from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. EDT. A public comment period took place from 11:50 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. EDT.\n\nThis convening followed the June 4, 2020 181st BIFAD meeting, Food Security and Nutrition in the Context of COVID-19, to provide an update on the impacts of the pandemic on nutrition outcomes and to discuss USAID's response. The COVID-19 crisis risks backsliding on nutrition gains with irrevocable impacts on mortality and lost potential. Initial projections show likely significant increases in wasting and forthcoming analyses will quantify the potential impacts on small for gestational age, micronutrient deficiencies, stunting and declines in breastfeeding. Field reporting indicates significant reduction in coverage of key nutrition interventions. These will all translate in loss of life and development gains if not countered with adequate action on nutrition as global decision makers focus on response and recovery.\n\nThe meeting provided dedicated time to discuss how the global community can work together to protect and advance nutrition outcomes across sectors during COVID-19 response and recovery. In real time, researchers and implementers are gathering evidence to better understand the impacts of the pandemic and learning how to respond.\n\nThe meeting was organized to achieve three objectives:\n\n1. To provide an update on what emerging research and data can tell us about the current and expected impacts of COVID-19 containment and control measures on nutrition, and how we should use this emerging evidence to guide our response.\n\n2. To learn from our implementing partners and USAID Missions across sectors that have pivoted their implementation to respond to COVID-19 and protect nutrition outcomes. To understand the realities on the ground, and to include the innovations and expertise of those on the frontlines in the discourse.\n\n3. To discuss and prioritize actions for the near, medium, and long term to safeguard and accelerate nutrition progress.\n\nThe meeting was intended to help support decision making by USAID and its partners and stakeholders working to advance food security and nutrition at global, regional and national levels. On the basis of testimony, including public comments, shared at the meeting, BIFAD provided formal findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the Agency on best-bet operational and programmatic investments.\n\n181st BIFAD Public Meeting\n\nFood Security and Nutrition in the Context of COVID-19: Impacts and Interventions\n\nJune 4 2020, 1:30 to 3:30 pm EDT\n\nTo view the agenda and presentations, click here.\n\nTo hear a recording of the public meeting, click here.\n\nTo view findings, conclusions, and recommendations, click here.\n\nTo view minutes of the meeting, click here.\n\nTo view the Agency response to BIFAD's recommendations, click here.\n\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and measures put in place to stop its spread will have impacts on all intermediate results of the U.S. Government Global Food Security Strategy, including agricultural productivity, livelihoods, markets, trade and policy actions, food consumption and nutrition, hygiene and resilience. The Board for International Food and Agricultural Development (BIFAD), an advisory committee to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), convened a virtual public meeting to share the thinking of leading experts in food security and nutrition that relates to COVID-19 impacts. This included consideration of the most promising short-, medium-, and long-term responses across several key areas: farm-level productivity, markets and trade, access to finance, nutrition, safe and hygienic food systems, gender, and national and local policy. The meeting included presentations of credible modeling data about the scale and breadth of anticipated food security impacts in the developing world and a summary spanning near to longer-term interventions and guidance that may help to mitigate COVID-19 impacts. The meeting also provided leading sources of curated information (e.g., landing pages for information related to the crisis and response). The meeting was intended to help to support decision making by USAID and its partners and stakeholders working to advance food security, nutrition, and resilience at global, regional and national levels.\n\nThe meeting was a 2-hour webinar, open to the public, with an expert panel and a 20-minute public comment period from 3:10 to 3:30 pm. The recorded audio and video and meeting minutes are available in archive form. On the basis of testimony, including public comments shared at the meeting, BIFAD provided formal findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the Agency on best-bet operational and programmatic investments."
