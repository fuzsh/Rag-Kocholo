        "text": "Section I : Principles\n\nArticle 1\n\nThe aim of this Act is to protect the lives and well-being of animals, based on the responsibility of human beings for their fellow creatures. No one may cause an animal pain, suffering or harm without good reason.\n\nSection II : Animal Husbandry\n\nArticle 2\n\nAny person keeping, caring for or required to care for an animal:\n\n1. must provide the animal with food, care and housing appropriate to its species, its requirements and behaviour;\n\n2. may not restrict the animal's possibility of species-specific freedom of movement to such an extent as to cause the animal pain or avoidable suffering or harm;\n\n3. must possess the knowledge and skills necessary for providing the animal with adequate food, care and housing in accordance with its behavioural requirements.\n\nArticle 2a\n\n(1) The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry, hereinafter referred to as \"the Federal Ministry\", shall hereby be empowered, if required for the welfare of animals, to issue ordinances, with the consent of the Bundesrat, specifying in greater detail the requirements of Article 2 regarding animal husbandry and shall, in particular, issue provisions on requirements regarding:\n\n1. the animals' freedom of movement or need for company;\n\n2. rooms, cages, other containers and other facilities for housing animals and the nature of any tethers, feeding and drinking facilities;\n\n3. the lighting conditions and temperature of the animal housing;\n\n4. the care and supervision of the animals. The Federal Ministry may order that the results of monitoring shall be recorded, kept and presented to the competent authority on request;\n\n5. the knowledge and skills of persons keeping, caring for or required to care for animals and the proof of such knowledge and skills of persons keeping, caring for or required to care for animals for commercial purposes.\n\n(1a) The Federal Ministry shall be empowered, with the consent of the Bundesrat, if required for the welfare of animals, to issue ordinances stipulating the requirements regarding the aims, equipment and methods in the instruction, education or training of animals.\n\n(2) The Federal Ministry shall be empowered, in agreement with the Federal Ministry of Transport, to issue ordinances, with the consent of the Bundesrat, regarding the transport of animals if required for the welfare of the animals.\n\nIt may, in particular,\n\n1. lay down requirements\n\na) regarding the transportability of animals;\n\nb) regarding the means of transport for animals;\n\n1a. to prohibit or restrict specific means and modes of transport for the carriage of specific animals, in particular c.o.d. consignments;\n\n2. to prescribe specific means and modes of transport for the carriage of specific animals;\n\n3. to prescribe that specific animals must be accompanied by a keeper during transport;\n\n3a. to prescribe that persons carrying out animal transports or who are involved in them have specific knowledge and skills and must be able to prove them;\n\n4. to issue provisions governing the loading, unloading, housing, feeding and care of animals;prescribe specific certificates, statements or notifications as a prerequisite for carrying out animal transports as well as to regulate their issuance and filing; to prescribe that persons professionally engaged in carrying out animal transports require a licence by the competent authority or must be registered with the competent authority as well as to regulate the prerequisites and procedure of licensing and registration; to prescribe that persons intending to feed, care for or accommodate animals during transport in a facility or firm require a licence by the competent authority and to regulate the prerequisites and procedure of licensing, to the extent that this is required for the implementation of legal instruments by the European Community.\n\nArticle 3\n\nIt shall be prohibited:\n\n1. to require an animal to produce performances clearly beyond its strength or capacity, in view of its condition, save in emergencies;\n\n1a. to require an animal, which has been subject to operations or treatments covering a performance-reducing physical condition, to produce performances its physical condition do not allow;\n\n1b. to perform procedures on an animal during training or sport competitions or similar events involving severe pain, suffering or harm which could impair the performance of the animals as well as to dope animals in sport competitions or similar events;\n\n2. to sell or buy an ill, a diseased, worn-out or old animal kept in a home, on a holding or otherwise in human care, incapable of surviving without irremediable pain or suffering, other than for the purpose of painlessly putting down the animal without delay. This shall not apply to direct sale of a diseased animal to a person or establishment which has been granted authorization under Article 8 and, in the case of a vertebrate, an exemption under Article 9, paragraph 2 (7), second sentence for experiments on such animals;\n\n3. to abandon or leave an animal kept in a home, on a holding or otherwise in human care to get rid of it or to shirk the duty of keeper or caretaker;\n\n4. to release into the wild or settle an animal bred or brought up in captivity and unprepared to feed itself in its new habitat in a species-adequate manner and unadapted to the climate there; the provisions under hunting and nature conservation law shall remain unaffected;\n\n5. to subject an animal to training causing the animal severe pain, suffering or harm;\n\n6. to use an animal for filming, exhibition, advertising or similar events causing the animal pain, suffering or harm;\n\n7. to train or test an animal for strength against another living animal;\n\n8. to set one animal on another save where the rules of sportsmanlike hunting require;\n\n8a. to train or break an animal to develop such an aggressive behaviour that it\n\na) causes the animal pain, suffering or harm or\n\nb) causes the animal or a conspecific pain or avoidable suffering or harm in any species-specific contact with conspecifics;\n\nc) allows its keeping only under conditions, which cause the animal pain or\n\navoidable suffering or harm;\n\n9. to force-feed an animal save for essential health reasons;\n\n10. to give an animal food causing the animal severe pain, suffering or harm;\n\n11. to use a device which by applying direct electrocution considerably restricts the species-specific behaviour of an animal, in particular its movement, or forces it to move thereby causing the animal considerable pain, suffering or harm, unless federal or Land provisions authorize such practices.\n\nSection III : Killing\n\nArticle 4\n\n(1) Vertebrates may be killed only under anaesthetic or painlessly where reasonable under the circumstances. Where killing of a vertebrate without anaesthetic is authorized, either as part of sportsmanlike hunting or pursuant to other provisions, or forms part of a permissible pest control campaign, the killing may be carried out only if it causes no more than unavoidable pain. Only persons with the requisite expertise and skills may kill a vertebrate.(1a) Persons professionally or commercially engaged in stunning or killing vertebrates have to furnish proof of such expertise to the competent authority. If poultry is stunned or killed within the framework of an activity under the first sentence in the presence of a supervisor this person shall also furnish proof of expertise apart from the person stunning or killing the animals. If within the framework of such an activity under the first sentence fish are stunned or killed in the presence of a supervisor, it shall be sufficient that he furnishes proof of expertise.\n\n(2) Article 4a shall apply to the slaughter of warm-blooded animals.\n\n(3) Articles 8b, 9 paragraph 2, second sentence shall apply to the killing of vertebrates for scientific purposes and Article 9, paragraph 2 (7) shall apply to dogs, cats, monkeys and lemurs mutatis mutandis.\n\nArticle 4a\n\n(1) Warm-blooded animals may be slaughtered only if stunned before exsanguination.\n\n(2) By way of derogation from paragraph (1), no stunning shall be required if:\n\n1. it is impossible under the circumstances in the case of an emergency slaughter;\n\n2. the competent authority have granted an exemption for slaughter without stunning (ritual slaughter); this exemption may be granted only where necessary to meet the requirements of members of religious communities in the territory covered by this Act whose mandatory rules require ritual slaughter and prohibit consumption of meat of animals not slaughtered in this way;\n\n3. this is meant as an exemption by ordinance under Article 4b (3).\n\nArticle 4b\n\nThe Federal Ministry shall be empowered, with the consent of the Bundesrat, by ordinance:\n\n1. a) to govern the slaughter of fish and other cold-blooded animals;\n\nb) to lay down detailed rules governing, prescribing, authorizing or prohibiting specific forms of killing and methods of anaesthetization;\n\nc) to lay down in greater detail the conditions under which the slaughters provided for in Article 4a, paragraph 2 (2) may be carried out;\n\nd) to lay down detailed rules on the type and scope of the knowledge and skills required for the anaesthetization or killing of vertebrates as well as on the procedure for proving them;\n\ne) to stipulate non-commercial activities requiring the acquisition of proof of expertise for the killing of vertebrates;to ensure that only unavoidable pain is inflicted on the animals;\n\n2. to lay down detailed rules governing the slaughter of animals in line with the European Convention of 10 May 1979 for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter (Federal Law Gazette 1983 II, p. 770);\n\n3. to stipulate exemptions from the stunning obligation for the slaughter of poultry.\n\nOrdinances pursuant to the first sentence (1b and 1d) require, if they refer to the anaesthetization or killing by means of hazardous substances or preparations as defined in the Act on Chemicals or related prerequisites for the acquisition of proof of expertise, the agreement of the Federal Ministries of Labour and Social Affairs, of Health as well as of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety.\n\nSection IV : Operations on Animals\n\nArticle 5\n\n(1) Painful operations may not be carried out on vertebrates without anaesthetic. In the case of warm-blooded vertebrates as well as amphibians and reptiles, the anaesthetic shall be administered by a veterinarian. Whenever evidence can be furnished that there is good reason to do so, the competent authority may grant exemptions from the second sentence if the anaesthetic is administered in cartridge form. If anaesthetization is unnecessary under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 (1), all possibilities shall be exhausted to reduce the pain and suffering of animals.\n\n(2) No anaesthetization shall be required if:\n\n1. no anaesthetic is usually administered for comparable operations on human beings or the pain caused by the operation is less than the impairment of the animal's well-being caused by anaesthetization;\n\n2. in the opinion of the veterinarian, it does not seem possible to administer anaesthetic in the specific case in point.\n\n(3) In addition, no anaesthetization shall be required for:\n\n1. the castration of male cattle, pigs, sheep and goats under four weeks of age provided their anatomy shows no signs of deviation from normal;\n\n2. the removal of horns or prevention of horn growth in cattle under six weeks of age;\n\n3. the docking of tails of piglets under four days old or lambs under eight days old;\n\n4. the docking of tails of lambs under eight days old using elastic rings;\n\n5. the grinding down of corner teeth of piglets if this is indispensable for the protection of the dam and the litter-mates;\n\n6. the separation of the claw-bearing last toe of broiler chicks to be used as breeding cockerel chicks on the first day of their life;\n\n7. the identification of pigs, sheep, goats and rabbits by ear tattooing, for the identification of other mammals during the first two weeks of life by ear and thigh tattooing as well as the identification of farm animals, including horses, by ear tags, wing tags, injected microchips, except for poultry, by slap marks in the case of pigs and the branding of horses‘ thighs.\n\n(4) The Federal Ministry shall be empowered with the consent of the Bundesrat to issue ordinances\n\n1. in addition to paragraph 3 to exempt further measures from the anaesthetization obligation if this is in line with Article 1;\n\n2. to prescribe, authorize or prohibit procedures and methods for implementing the measures listed in paragraph 3 as well as pursuant to an ordinance under (1) to prescribe, authorize or prohibit specific measures, to the extent that this is necessary for animal welfare.\n\nArticle 6\n\n(1) The amputation of all or part of parts of the body or the removal or destruction of all or parts of organs or tissues of a vertebrate shall be prohibited. This prohibition shall not apply if:\n\n1. the operation in the specific case\n\na) is necessary according to veterinary indication or\n\nb) is essential in the case of hounds for the intended use of the animals and there are no objections by the veterinarian;\n\n2. the case falls under Article 5, paragraph 3 (1) or (7);\n\n3. the case falls under Article 5, paragraph 3 (2) to (6) and the operation in the individual case is essential for the intended use of the animal with respect to its protection or the protection of other animals;\n\n4. removal of all or part of organs or tissues is required for transplantation purposes or to establish cultures or to examine individual organs, tissues or cells;\n\n5. a sterilization is performed to prevent the uncontrolled reproduction of the animal or - if there are no objections on the part of the veterinarian - for the further use or keeping of the animal.\n\nThe operations referred to in the second sentence (1) and (5) shall be performed by a veterinarian. The operations referred to in the second sentence, (2) and\n\n(3) as well as paragraph 3 may be carried out by other persons with the requisite expertise and skills. For the operations referred to in the second sentence (4), Articles 8b, 9, paragraph 1, sentences 1, 3 and 4, paragraph 2, except for the third sentence (6), paragraph 3, first sentence as well as Article 9a shall apply mutatis mutandis. The operations shall be notified to the competent authority two weeks at the latest before the operation begins. This time limit need not be observed if the operation must immediately be performed in emergencies. The notification shall then be sent immediately afterwards. The competent authority may extend the time limit referred to in the fifth sentence up to four weeks, if required. The notification shall indicate:\n\n1. the purpose of the operation;\n\n2. species and number of the animals intended for the operation;\n\n3. the type of operation, and procedure to be used, including anaesthetization;\n\n4. place, beginning and likely duration of the operation;\n\n5. name, address and expertise of the responsible head of the project, his deputy and of the person carrying out the project as well as the eligible persons for after-treatment;\n\n6. the reasons for the operation.\n\n(2) The use of elastic rings for amputation or castration shall be prohibited. This shall not apply in the case referred to in Article 5, paragraph 3 (4) or in Article 6, paragraph 3 (2).\n\n(3) By way of derogation from paragraph 1, first sentence, the competent authority may authorize\n\n1. the clipping of the beak point of poultry;\n\n2. the docking of the fibrous tag of male calves under three months of age by means of elastic rings.\n\nThe authorization may only be granted if it can be substantiated that the operation is essential for the intended use in view of animal welfare. The authorization shall apply for a fixed period and shall contain in the case of\n\n(1) provisions regarding the type, scope and time of the operation and the person performing the operation.\n\n(4) The Federal Ministry shall be empowered, with the consent of the Bundesrat to issue ordinances prescribing the permanent identification of animals on which not clearly visible operations have been performed if this is required for animal welfare.\n\n(5) In the case referred to in paragraph 1, second sentence (3) it shall be substantiated to the competent authority upon request that the operation is essential for the intended use.\n\nArticle 6a\n\nThe provisions of this Section shall not apply to experiments on animals, to operations for educational, training and further training purposes and to operations for the manufacture, production, conservation and propagation of substances, products or organisms.\n\nSection V : Experiments on Animals\n\nArticle 7\n\n(1) For the purpose of this Act \"Experiments on animals\" means any operation or treatment for experimental purposes\n\n1. on animals which may cause these animals pain, suffering or harm or\n\n2. on the animal genotype which may cause the genetically modified animals, or their carrier animals pain, suffering or harm.\n\n(2) Experiments may only be carried out on animals if they are indispensable for one of the following purposes:\n\n1. the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases, suffering, bodily defects or other abnormalities or the detection or exertion of influence of physiological conditions or functions in human beings or animals;\n\n2. the detection of environmental hazards;\n\n3. the testing of substances or products to ensure that they are safe in terms of human or animal health or that they are effective against animal pests;\n\n4. basic research.\n\nThe decision whether experiments on animals are indispensable shall be based in particular on the scientific findings available at the time and on checks whether the same purpose can be achieved by other methods or procedures.\n\n(3) Experiments may be carried out on vertebrates only if the pain, suffering or harm they can be expected to inflict on the laboratory animals is ethically justifiable in view of the purpose of the experiment. Experiments causing lasting or repeated severe pain or suffering to vertebrates may be carried out only if the results are expected to be of outstanding importance for the fundamental needs of human beings or animals, including the solution of scientific problems.\n\n(4) Experiments on animals to develop or test weapons, ammunition and related equipment shall be prohibited.\n\n(5) In principle, experiments on animals to develop tobacco products, detergents and cosmetics shall be prohibited. The Federal Ministry shall be empowered, with the consent of the Bundesrat, by ordinance to stipulate exemptions in the case of cosmetics in agreement with the Federal Ministry of Health, wherever necessary to\n\n1. avoid specific health hazards and wherever there is no other way of obtaining the new findings required or\n\n2. implement legal instruments of the European Community.\n\nArticle 8\n\n(1) Any person wishing to conduct experiments on vertebrates must obtain authorization of the planned experiment from the competent authority.\n\n(2) The application for authorization of the planned experiment must be submitted to the competent authority in writing. The application must:\n\n1. set out scientific evidence substantiating that the conditions laid down in (1) of paragraph 3 have been met;\n\n2. demonstrate that the conditions laid down in (2) to (4) of paragraph 3 have been met;\n\n3. set out that the conditions laid down in (5) of paragraph 3 have been met.In addition, the application must contain the data mentioned in (1) to (5) of Article 8a, paragraph 2.\n\n(3) Authorization shall be granted only if and when:\n\n1. scientific evidence is produced that:\n\na) the conditions laid down in Articles 7, paragraphs 2 and 3 have been met;\n\nb) not enough is known about the test result aimed at despite exhausting all accessible sources of information or a repeat or duplicate experiment is essential to confirm a result which is sufficiently known;\n\n2. the head of the experiment and his deputy possess the requisite expertise, particularly with respect to the supervision of animal experiments and there are no facts casting doubt on their reliability;\n\n3. the requisite installations, equipment and other technical resources are available together with the personnel and organization for conducting experiments on animals, including the activities of the animal welfare officer;\n\n4. it can be ensured that the animals' accommodation, care, supervision and medical attention satisfying the requirements laid down in Article 2;\n\n5. Articles 9, paragraphs 1 and 2 and 9a can be expected to be observed.\n\n(4) The notice of authorization shall state the head of the experiment and his deputy. The authorization holder shall inform the competent authority immediately of any change of head of the experiment or deputy; the authorization shall remain valid unless revoked within one month.\n\n(5) The authorization shall apply for a limited period. In the case referred to in paragraph 5a, first sentence, the expected duration of the planned experiment mentioned in the application shall apply.\n\n(5a) The authorization shall be deemed to be granted if the authority has not made a written decision on the application within a period of three months, in the case of experiments on anaesthetized animals to be killed during anaesthetization within a period of two months. The competent authority may extend the period of two months if required up to three months after hearing the applicant. In calculating the period, the times shall not be considered during which the applicant did not meet the requirements under paragraph 2 despite written request of the competent authority. The authorization under the first sentence may subsequently be made subject to requirements if this is required to meet the conditions of paragraph 3.\n\n(6) If the authorization is granted to a university or other such establishment, the persons conducting the experiments on animals must be employed at the establishment or authorized to use the establishment by the director in charge.\n\n(7) No authorization shall be required for planned experiments\n\n1. expressly required:\n\na) by an act, an ordinance or the Pharmacopoeia or directly applicable legal instrument issued by an institution of the European Communities;\n\nb) by general administrative provisions issued by the Federal Government or by a Federal Ministry, with the consent of the Bundesrat, in line with Articles 7, paragraphs 2 and 3 or\n\nc) by order of a judge or an authority, based on a law, ordinance or directly applicable legal instrument issued by an institution of the European Communities or in individual cases as a prerequisite for the issue of administrative acts;\n\n2. taking the form of vaccinations, withdrawal of blood samples or any other diagnostic measures in line with proven methods and\n\na) serving to detect, in particular, diseases, suffering, bodily defects or other abnormalities in human beings or animals or\n\nb) serving to test serums, blood preparations, vaccines, antigens or test allergens within the framework of authorization procedures or batch tests.\n\nIn addition, the authorization does not require any changes in authorized planned experiments if\n\n1. the purpose of the planned experiment remains the same;\n\n2. the laboratory animals do not sustain any more pain, suffering or harm;\n\n3. there is no major increase in the number of laboratory animals and\n\n4. these changes had been notified to the competent authority beforehand;\n\nArticle 8a, paragraphs 2 and 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\nArticle 8a\n\n(1) Any person intending to conduct experiments on vertebrates for which no authorization is required or on cephalopods or decapods shall notify the planned experiment to the competent authority at least two weeks before the experiment begins. This time limit need not be observed in emergencies where the experiment must be carried out immediately. In this case notification shall be sent immediately afterwards. The time limit referred to in the first sentence may be extended by the competent authority, if required, to up to four weeks.\n\n(2) The notification shall indicate:\n\n1. the purpose of the planned experiment;\n\n2. the species and, in the case of vertebrates, also the number of animals to be used for the planned experiment;\n\n3. the type of animal experiments planned and the procedures to be used, including anaesthetization;\n\n4. the place, beginning and likely duration of the planned experiment;\n\n5. the name, address and expertise of the head of the experiment in charge, of his deputy and of the person performing the experiment as well as of the eligible persons for after-treatment;\n\n6. in the case of planned experiments pursuant to Article 8, paragraph 7 (1) the legal basis for exemption from authorization.\n\n(3) If several experiments of the same type are planned, notification of the first shall suffice, provided the notification indicates the expected number of planned experiments. At the end of each year the competent authority shall be informed of the number of experiments conducted and, in the case of vertebrates, of the type and total number of animals used.\n\n(4) Should the details listed in paragraph 2 change in the course of the experiment, the competent authority must be notified of the changes immediately unless the changes make no difference to the supervision of the experiment.\n\n(5) The competent authority shall prohibit experiments on animals if the facts justify the assumption that the observance of Articles 7, paragraphs 2 or 3, 8b, paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6 or 9, paragraphs 1 or 2 cannot be ensured and this defect cannot be remedied within the time limit set by the competent authority.\n\n(6) The Federal Ministry shall be empowered by ordinance, with the consent of the Bundesrat, to extend the notification requirement under paragraph 1 to experiments on other invertebrates, if this is required for the welfare of animals of a corresponding sensory development stage as vertebrates.\n\nArticle 8b\n\n(1) Heads of institutions, where experiments are conducted on vertebrates, shall appoint one or more animal welfare officers and notify each appointment to the competent authority. The notification shall also indicate the position and powers of the animal welfare officer under paragraph 6, third sentence of this Article.\n\n(2) Only persons who have completed university studies of veterinary medicine, medicine or biology (spezializing in zoology) may be appointed as animal welfare officers. They must possess the expertise and reliability needed to discharge their tasks. In individual cases the competent authority may grant exemptions from the first sentence.\n\n(3) The animal welfare officer shall be obliged:\n\n1. to ensure that the provisions, conditions and requirements shall be observed in the interest of animal welfare;\n\n2. to advise the institution and the staff involved in animal experiments and the keeping of laboratory animals;\n\n3. to give his opinion on each application for authorization to conduct an experiment on animals;\n\n4. to work towards the development and introduction of procedures and means for avoiding or reducing experiments on animals inside the institutions.\n\n(4) If the animal welfare officer conducts an experiment himself, another animal welfare officer must supervise the planned experiment.\n\n(5) The institution must support the animal welfare officer in the performance of his tasks and inform him of every planned experiment so that he can carry out his duties without restriction.\n\n(6) The animal welfare officer shall not be bound by any instructions when fulfilling his tasks. He may not be discriminated against because of the performance of his tasks. His position and powers shall be laid down by statute, by internal instructions or in a similar form. In the process steps shall be taken to ensure that the animal welfare officer can voice his proposals or reservations directly before the decision-making body in the institution. If several animal welfare officers are appointed, the scope of duties of each shall be clearly defined.\n\nArticle 9\n\n(1) Only persons with the requisite expertise may conduct experiments on animals. Furthermore, only persons who have completed university studies of veterinary medicine or medicine or natural sciences or persons, who demonstrably possess the requisite expertise due to vocational qualifications, may conduct experiments on vertebrates, with the exception of the experiments covered by Article 8, paragraph 7 (2). Animal experiments involving surgical operations on vertebrates may be performed only by persons who have completed university studies in:\n\n1. veterinary medicine or medicine or\n\n2. biology (specializing in zoology), provided these persons are employed at universities or other scientific establishments.\n\nThe competent authority may grant exemptions from the provisions in the second and third sentences if proof of the requisite expertise can be furnished in another way.\n\n(2) Experiments on animals shall be limited to the absolute minimum. In performing them account shall be taken of scientific knowledge. The following conditions shall apply, in particular:\n\n1. Experiments may be carried out on animals with more highly developed sensory systems, and in particular on warm-blooded animals, only when experiments on animals with less developed sensory systems will not suffice for the purpose. Experiments may be carried out on animals taken from the wild only if experiments on other animals will not suffice for the purpose.\n\n2. No more animals than necessary to achieve the purpose of the experiment may be used.\n\n3. Pain, suffering or harm may be inflicted on the animals only in so far as unavoidable to attain the purpose of the experiment. They may not be inflicted, in particular, to save work, time or costs.\n\n4. Subject to the provisions of the fourth sentence of this paragraph, experiments may be conducted on vertebrates only under anaesthetic. The anaesthetic may be administered only by, or under the supervision of, a person meeting the conditions laid down in sentences 1 and 2 of paragraph 1. If the vertebrate is likely to suffer considerable pain when the anaesthetic wears off, the animal must be treated with pain-killing drugs in good time, unless this is incompatible with the purposes of the experiment. Vertebrates which have not been anaesthetized may:\n\na) not be subjected to operations causing serious injuries;\n\nb) only be subjected to an operation if the resultant pain is less serious than\n\nthe impairment of the laboratory animal's well-being caused by the anaesthetic or if the purpose of the experiment excludes anaesthetization.\n\nVertebrates, which have not been anaesthetized, may only be subjected once to an operation or treatment entailing severe pain unless there is no other way of attaining the purpose of the experiment. Vertebrates, which have not been anaesthetized, may not be given any drug to stop or restrict them from showing their pain.\n\n5. Vertebrates subjected to serious operations or used for an experiment entailing severe or lasting pain or suffering or serious harm may not be used for any further experiments unless their general state of health and well-being have been fully restored and the further experiment\n\na) entails no suffering or harm and only minor pain or\n\nb) is performed under anaesthetic and the animal is killed under this anaesthetic.\n\n6. Animals used in experiments to determine the lethal dose or lethal concentration of a substance shall be put down painlessly as soon as it becomes clear that they are dying under the action of the substance.\n\n7. Vertebrates, except horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, chicken, pigeons, turkey, ducks, geese and fish, may be used in experiments on animals only if they have been bred for such a purpose. If compatible with animal welfare, the competent authority may grant exemptions from this provision if no animals of the species in question specifically bred for experimental purposes are available for the experiment or if the purpose of the experiment demands the use of animals of other origin.\n\n8. At the end of the experiment every surviving monkey, lemur, soliped or cloven-hoofed animal, dog, hamster, cat, rabbit and guinea pig used shall be presented to a veterinarian for examination without delay. If the veterinarian concludes that the animal cannot survive without pain or suffering, the animal shall be put down painlessly without delay. Animals other than those specified in the first sentence shall also be put down painlessly without delay if deemed necessary by the person performing the experiment. Animals to be kept alive at the end of the experiment must receive the care appropriate to their state of health, be placed under the supervision of a veterinarian or another qualified person and be given any medical care that might be necessary.\n\n(3) The head of the experiment or his deputy shall be responsible for the observance of the provisions laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2. The same shall apply to fulfilment of any requirements attached to the authorization in line with Article 8.\n\nArticle 9a\n\n(1) Records shall be kept of all experiments on animals. The records must state the purpose of each experiment, in particular the reasons for allowing experiments on animals with more highly developed sensory systems in line with Article 9, paragraph 2 (1), the number and designation of the animals used and the nature and procedure of the experiments. Whenever vertebrates are used, details of their origin, including the name and address of the previous owner, shall also be given. Where cats and dogs are concerned, details of their sex, breed, coat type and pattern and any identifying markings must also be given. The records must be signed by the persons performing the experiments and the head of the experiment. Records drawn up automatically need not be signed.
