        "text": "+++ Tuesday, 05.04.2022 +++\n\nThe Federal Government continues to support businesses in the Corona pandemic. The Corona economic aid has therefore been extended as a hedging instrument until the end of June 2022. The new start-up aid for the self-employed will also be continued.\n\nAid for particularly affected sectors\n\nMany companies can go about their business again after the far-reaching lifting of the Corona restrictions. They no longer need state support. However, there are economic sectors or groups of people to whom this does not yet apply. Business sectors with a planning lead time, such as the event industry, still need support until they can generate their own turnover again. For these businesses and self-employed persons, the extended Bridging Assistance IV is available.\n\nApplications now possible\n\nBusinesses that have already received Bridging Assistance IV for January to March 2022 and need further assistance can simply apply for funding for the extension months April to June 2022 by submitting an amendment application.\n\nAll businesses that have not yet applied for Bridging Assistance IV can now submit an initial application for the full funding period January to June 2022. The content of the bridging assistance IV extended until the end of June, including the new start-up assistance 2022, has remained unchanged and will again be processed via the platform www.ueberbrueckungshilfe-unternehmen.de.\n\n+++ Monday, 28.03.2022 +++\n\nIn view of the continuing high infection figures and heavy burden in hospitals, Federal Health Minister Lauterbach has called for swift action. The federal states should declare themselves hotspots so that comprehensive protective measures would continue to exist. Unvaccinated people should definitely get vaccinated.\n\n\"The pandemic is far from over. There can be no talk of a Freedom Day,\" said Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach in Berlin. There are currently 300,000 new infections per day. Moreover, it can be assumed that the actual number of new infections is more than twice as high. Around 300 deaths are reported every day.\n\nSituation reflected in hospitals\n\nAccording to the minister, the infection situation also has an impact on the situation in hospitals: Some staff members are heavily infected, there are emergency operations, and surgeries are being postponed. \"All in all, this is a situation where we have to react immediately and quickly.\"\n\nLauterbach named three points of action:\n\n1. use hotspot regulation\n\nThe minister appealed to the LÃ¤nder to make use of the hot spot regulation, which was laid down in the amendment to the Infection Protection Act. It provides that the federal states can take more extensive protective measures than the basic protection in the case of a locally threatening infection situation. A threatening situation exists when either a dangerous virus variant spreads or there is a threat of overloading hospitals - due to a particularly high number of new infections or a particularly strong increase in new infections.\n\nLauterbach said that hospitals would be overburdened if they were no longer able to provide emergency care, if scheduled operations had to be postponed or if there was a great shortage of staff due to corona infections.\n\nLauterbach announced that the federal and state health ministers would discuss the issue on Monday.\n\n2nd vaccination appeal to the unvaccinated\n\nThe minister reiterated the importance of vaccination. \"We have such a high number of cases that all those who are unvaccinated now must expect to become infected in the next few days,\" he warned. Unvaccinated people over the age of 60 are particularly at risk, he said, adding that there are also many people with immune deficiencies or pre-existing conditions.\n\n3rd vaccination for risk groups\n\nLauterbach called for a more aggressive approach to the fourth vaccination. Currently, less than ten per cent of those recommended by the Standing Commission on Vaccination (STIKO) for a second booster are actually vaccinated a fourth time. This is recommended for people over 70 years of age as well as risk patients with certain pre-existing conditions and for employees in health and care facilities.\n\n+++ Thursday, 17.03.2022 +++\n\nWith the planned discontinuation of most protective measures as of 20 March, Germany will enter a new phase of the pandemic after two years. This was emphasised by Chancellor Scholz after the consultations of the federal and state governments on the pandemic situation.\n\nThe amended Infection Protection Act, which is to be passed by the Bundestag and Bundesrat on Friday, takes the pandemic development into account, emphasised Chancellor Olaf Scholz after the consultations with the heads of government of the federal states. However: the pandemic is not over yet. Currently, the incidence figures are rising again and are at a very high level.\n\nSituation no longer so dramatic\n\nThe good news, however, according to Scholz, is that the situation in hospitals and intensive care units is no longer as dramatic as it would have been in the past with such high numbers. In addition, the disease is currently milder in most people, especially those who have been vaccinated, Scholz explained.\n\nDoing without most measures\n\n\"Now we are entering a new phase of the pandemic, in which we - like almost all of our neighbouring countries - will dispense with most protective measures,\" Scholz said. The Infection Protection Act, which is to be passed by the Bundestag and Bundesrat on Friday, takes this development into account, he said.\n\nThe Infection Protection Act contains basic measures, such as the wearing of protective masks in buses and trains as well as in hospitals and nursing homes. It also provides for precautions in case the Corona situation worsens in individual regions. Even if the LÃ¤nder wished for more, \"it is nevertheless a legal basis on which to build in the future,\" said the Chancellor.\n\nActing on one's own responsibility\n\nScholz appealed to citizens to continue to follow the hygiene rules - to keep their distance, and to voluntarily wear a mask for their own protection.\n\nHe also called on all unvaccinated people to \"finally\" get vaccinated in view of autumn. The current omicron variant, he said, more often leads to severe courses in the unvaccinated, with far too many dying. \"That's why it is my great wish that everyone motivates themselves once again and makes use of this vaccination option.\" It remains a task \"that we must dedicate ourselves to together\".\n\n+++ Wednesday, 16.03.2022 +++\n\nProven occupational health and safety measures such as test offers and home office remain in place. They are no longer prescribed, but are stipulated as possible protective measures. The federal cabinet has taken note of the revised Corona Occupational Health and Safety Ordinance.\n\nDespite a decline expected in the medium term, it can be assumed that the infection figures will remain significantly high in the near future. As the current regulations of the Corona Occupational Health and Safety Ordinance end on 19 March, an adapted ordinance is to apply until 25 May 2022.\n\nThe companies and their employees would still have to take basic protective measures for a transitional period in order to prevent infections at work, explained Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil on the extension of the regulation. He warned: \"We must all act prudently and responsibly.\"\n\nCompanies must protect workers\n\nCompanies are still obliged to protect workers from health hazards. In future, however, they will be responsible for deciding on the necessary measures - depending on the local infection situation and the activity-specific infection risks.\n\nFrom 20 March onwards, companies will have to check as part of their risk assessment\n\n- the implementation of the AHA+L rule,\n\n- the reduction of workplace-related personal contacts,\n\n- the availability of in-company testing.\n\nAfter the risk assessment, the measures are laid down in the company hygiene concept. The instruments are known and proven and can be applied at any time. For example, employers can continue to offer employees the opportunity to work in a home office and - in order to recognise infections in the workplace in good time - continue to make offers of testing. Employers must also continue to support employees in taking advantage of vaccination offers. In this way, the federal government wants to counteract health risks for employees and economic losses for companies.\n\n+++\n\nMinor differences in first and last names and name additions such as doctor titles are no longer a problem in the Corona Warning app. The latest version of the app allows users to name names accurately.\n\nIf the first and last name in vaccination certificates did not match exactly, the Corona Warning app could not assign these certificates to one and the same person. This means that if, for example, the second name was given in one vaccination certificate and not in another, the app assigned the certificates to two different people. Only a newly issued certificate solved the problem. With the update, this is a thing of the past.\n\nIn future, the app will break down the first and last names into their components when comparing several certificates. The app also filters out name additions such as academic titles and assigns the certificates to the same person accordingly.\n\nThe Corona-Warn app recognises that two certificates belong to one person if:\n\n- first and last names either match exactly or at least one first name and at least one last name match, and\n\n- the dates of birth match exactly.\n\nFurthermore, users of the app receive a notification if the grouping of their certificates changes as a result of the adjustment.\n\n+++ Friday, 11.03.2022 +++\n\nWith over 250,000 new infections, the number of infections is higher than ever. Every day, 200 to 250 people currently die from Corona. \"We are in a critical situation,\" says Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach.\n\nThe incidence of infection is extremely dynamic, says Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. With currently more than 250,000 new infections and 200 to 250 people dying from Corona per day, the situation is worse than the mood, Lauterbach emphasised at a joint press conference with the President of the Robert Koch Institute Lothar Wieler. The minister: \"We are in a critical situation.\" He said it was to be expected that the number of deaths would continue to rise in the coming weeks.\n\nRKI President Wieler also considers the situation to be tense. \"Far too many people are still falling seriously ill with covid and too many people are still dying,\" he said. Of the thousand deaths per week, most people are over 70 years old and thus belong to the risk group, he said. Nevertheless, 14 per cent of those who die are also under 70 years old.\n\nLooking at the situation in hospitals, hospitalisation has increased; half of the current covid patients in intensive care units are over 70 years old, he said. The even more contagious Omicron sub-variant BA.2 already accounts for 50 per cent of all infections and is thus becoming more prevalent, Wieler added.\n\nVaccination is the best and safest way\n\nHealth Minister Lauterbach made it clear that vaccinations would continue to be needed \"to prevent a situation in autumn that we have now\". Vaccinations protect well against infection, even if not perfectly. Even if Omicron were to remain or become more dangerous, if the Delta variant were to break through with another variant or if recobination were to be assumed: \"More than 90 percent, about 96 percent of the genome of the viruses, also concerning the different strains\" are identical in these variants. For this reason, the vaccinations are still effective against the severe disease.\n\nRKI President Wieler also emphasised that vaccination remains the best and safest way to achieve immunity. \"The known vaccination reactions are much less pronounced compared to the consequences of an infection. Vaccination not only protects us from severe courses and death, but also from long covid. We are not only protecting ourselves, but also all the people we come into contact with, and thus all the people who are important to us.\n\n+++\n\nThe Corona rules are to be largely dropped from 20 March. However, basic protective measures such as the obligation to wear a mask, for example in hospitals or nursing homes, will remain in place. At the same time, stricter local regulations are to apply if the infection situation there requires it and the respective state parliament so decides. The Federal Cabinet has approved a draft amendment to the Infection Protection Act.\n\nThe previous legal basis for most Corona protection measures expires on 19 March. Now, the federal government has passed the draft for a follow-up regulation in the so-called circulation procedure. On the one hand, this provides for \"basic protection\" to protect particularly vulnerable people, and on the other hand, it allows for stricter restrictions for regions with a dangerous incidence of infection.\n\nBasic protection for vulnerable groups, local public transport and schools\n\nVulnerable people - including those in nursing homes, outpatient care or hospitals - are to continue to receive special protection. Certain basic protection measures such as mandatory masks and tests should therefore remain in place in these facilities. The obligation to wear masks in buses and trains and the obligation to test in schools should also remain in place.\n\nIntensification of the infection situation in \"hot spots\"\n\nIf there is a threatening infection situation locally, the LÃ¤nder can take further protective measures. The prerequisite is that the respective state parliament decides to do so.\n\nA dangerous situation in a so-called hot spot is given when either a dangerous virus variant is spreading or there is a threat of hospitals being overloaded - due to a particularly high number of new infections or a particularly strong increase in new infections.\n\nPossible localised measures include mandatory masks and a distance requirement of 1.5 metres in public spaces. In addition, it should be possible to oblige people to present proof of vaccination, convalescence or testing when entering certain facilities and businesses. It should also be possible to oblige establishments or services open to the public to draw up hygiene concepts.\n\nValidity of the measures\n\nA transitional period is provided for so that the Land parliaments can amend their previously applicable regulations: Measures taken on the basis of the previous Infection Protection Act can still be extended until 2 April.\n\nThe law is limited until 23 September. The legislator will then re-evaluate which measures are necessary in autumn and winter in view of the current situation.\n\nVaccination, convalescent and test certificates regulated in the Infection Protection Act\n\nSo far, vaccination, convalescence and test certificates have been defined in two ordinances - namely the COVID-19 Protection Measures Exemption Ordinance and the Coronavirus Entry Ordinance - which in turn refer to concretising internet publications of the Paul Ehrlich Institute and the Robert Koch Institute.\n\nDue to the special significance of vaccination, convalescence and test evidence, these terms are to be defined in the Infection Protection Act in future. This amendment was also part of the draft law passed by the Federal Cabinet.\n\n+++\n\nThe Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) has developed new information materials for refugee Ukrainians. The media package consists of nine fact sheets and infographics - for example with facts about vaccination.\n\nIn order to inform refugees from Ukraine about protection against a Corona infection and the Corona vaccination, the BZgA provides information materials in Ukrainian. The graphics and leaflets explain, for example, what rules like \"3G\" or \"2Gplus\" mean. They illustrate testing possibilities and hygiene tips. They also provide information on all questions about the COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nInformation to pass on to refugees\n\nThe media package is available for download here. It is primarily aimed at people who help Ukrainian refugees, for example workers in community shelters or people who are entrusted with the health care of the refugees. They can pass on the information where it is needed.\n\nHere you can find all the information materials of the Federal Centre for Health Education in Ukrainian.\n\nFurther information for helpers is provided by the Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration.\n\n+++ Monday, 07.03.2022 +++\n\nRelief in the catering trade, hotel industry and at events: From 4 March, the second stage of the relaxation plan, which the federal and state governments agreed on at their conference on 16 February, will take effect. Unvaccinated people, for example, with a negative test can reopen in restaurants, clubs and discos. The concrete implementation is up to the states.\n\nSince Friday, further Corona restrictions have been abolished in many federal states. The 3G rule now applies in restaurants and hotels. This means that in addition to vaccinated and recovered people, unvaccinated people with negative tests can also eat in restaurants or stay in hotels.\n\nClubs and discos that have been closed for a long time are also allowed to reopen. The 2G plus rule applies there: vaccinated and recovered persons are allowed in if they can also present a negative test result or are boostered.\n\nIn addition, more guests are again allowed at large supra-regional events. Indoors, a capacity of 60 per cent of the respective maximum capacity is permitted. The number of 6,000 people may not be exceeded. Outdoors, 75 per cent of the maximum capacity may be used, and a maximum of 25,000 people are permitted. For all of them, the 2G regulation or the 2G-Plus regulation applies.\n\n3-step plan for openings\n\nThe new relaxations are the second step of the nationwide opening plan that the federal and state governments had decided on 16 February. In a first step, private gatherings for vaccinated and convalescents had been eliminated. Access to retail shops was again possible nationwide for all persons without controls.\n\nBasic protection from 20 March\n\nThe federal and state governments had agreed that, in a third step, so-called basic protection would remain in place from 20 March. On 19 March, the Infection Protection Act expires; it is currently the basis for the Corona restrictions. The federal government is currently discussing an amendment to the law with the coalition parties.\n\nBasic protection measures include the wearing of masks on buses and trains or the distance requirement. In addition, it should remain possible to provide for compulsory testing in certain areas and to check vaccination, convalescent and test status.\n\n+++ Thursday,03.03.2022 +++\n\nEntering Germany will be easier again: As of Thursday, no country has been designated as a Corona high-risk area. The background to this is an amendment to the Coronavirus Entry Ordinance. According to this, no more countries are considered high-risk areas due to the spread of the Omikron variant. On 1 March, the Federal Government passed the Third Ordinance Amending the Coronavirus Entry Ordinance in a so-called circular procedure. The amended ordinance will come into force at midnight on 3 March. What changes?\n\nNew classification of high-risk areas\n\nIn future, the assumed severity of the disease will be taken into greater account when classifying high-risk areas. The classification as a high-risk area will only be made for those areas where a more dangerous virus than Omikron is rampant. This would be the case, for example, if the delta variant were to spread again.\n\nAccording to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany is now removing all Corona high-risk areas from the list. The regulation comes into force at midnight on Thursday. If a country is no longer a high-risk area, travellers will no longer have to register electronically for entry. In general, the 3G proof requirement (vaccinated, recovered, tested) still applies upon entry.\n\nRelief for children\n\nIf countries are again designated as high-risk areas, the amended entry regulation will make it easier for children to enter. Children under the age of six who return to Germany from a high-risk area no longer have to be quarantined. Until now, they had to spend five days in seclusion, which they could not end prematurely by testing negative. Children were only exempt from quarantine if they presented proof of recovery or vaccination.\n\nChildren between six and twelve years of age can now end the quarantine directly by a negative test. If they cannot show this, the quarantine ends automatically after five days, as before.\n\nThe 3G verification requirement is now generally waived for children up to twelve years of age. They no longer have to prove that they have been vaccinated, recovered or tested when entering the country from abroad. Previously, this only applied to children up to six years of age.\n\nThe obligation to present proof of testing based on nucleic acid detection (e.g. PCR) when entering a country from a virus variant area now also only applies from the age of twelve.\n\nThe classification of risk areas can change at short notice. Therefore, travellers should definitely check whether the countries in which they have stayed in the last ten days before entering Germany are classified as risk areas.\n\n+++ Monday, 28.02.2022 +++\n\nWith a view to the infection figures, Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach continued to call for great caution in his press conference on the pandemic situation on Friday: \"We have very high case numbers, which we may even be underestimating.\" In addition, he said, there are still 200 to 300 deaths per day.\n\nOmicron sub-variant spreads\n\nThe peak has been reached in the current wave, he said. At the same time, he pointed to the spread of the new BA.2 sub-variant, which is apparently not more severe, but more contagious. In Germany, it currently accounts for about 16 to 17 percent of cases, and more in large cities. If Germany is not careful, the number of cases could possibly rise again, Lauterbach emphasised.\n\nThe President of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, also warned that the situation should continue to be taken seriously. Elderly people are still at risk and need special protection. Wieler again pointed out the necessity of vaccination. A complete vaccination and especially the booster vaccination protect very well against severe courses and also deaths, especially among the elderly.\n\nNo room for faster openings\n\nLauterbach appealed to the federal states not to go beyond what was decided at the Minister Presidents' Conference last week. The federal minister stressed: \"We have no leeway at all for speeding up the openings.\" He did not share the assessment that a \"Freedom Day\", i.e. an end to the pandemic, was ahead of us.\n\n+++ Monday, 21.02.2022 +++\n\nGermany has passed the peak of the omicron wave, according to Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. The measures taken have had an effect. Nevertheless, \"we are not really in safe waters yet,\" Lauterbach said.\n\n\"My thanks to all those who have behaved fairly and carefully. Because we owe the successes we have to them,\" said Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach in Berlin on Friday. In his estimation, Germany has passed the peak of the Omicron wave in the Corona pandemic. He said that the measures taken had worked - with the aim of protecting the elderly in Germany in particular.\n\nBecause, he said, \"we have to assume that we have up to twelve per cent unvaccinated people among the over-60s. That is a particular challenge.\" Despite optimism, the Federal Health Minister warned, \"We are not really in safe waters yet.\"\n\nHe said that post-hospitalisation in particular continues to be a risk. This means that today's infections do not lead to treatment in hospital tomorrow, but with a significant delay, in some cases of up to 14 days, Lauterbach said. However, he did not see any danger of hospitals being overburdened at the present time.\n\nPandemic is not over\n\nThe vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute, Lars Schaade, also sees the peak for intensive care units not yet reached. The risk of infection remains high, he said, and older people must continue to be protected. \"The Sars coronavirus-2 will not disappear. We have to be prepared that there will be more Covid-19 waves in the future. We cannot yet predict exactly how they will proceed,\" said Schaade. Against this background, the best protection is still the Corona vaccination.\n\n\"The fact that we have come through the Omikron wave comparatively well so far is largely thanks to the prudence of the population and the fact that a large proportion of people have had themselves vaccinated and refreshed,\" said the RKI vice-president. \"I would therefore like to appeal once again to all those who are undecided: Please get vaccinated also with a view to the future, because the pandemic is not over yet.\" So far, more than 120,000 people have died in Germany in connection with the virus.\n\nModerate relaxations, but no excessive ones\n\nReferring to the decisions of the Conference of Minister Presidents, Federal Health Minister Lauterbach said: \"We can afford moderate relaxations, but not excessive ones.\" The minister appealed to the federal states not to go beyond the resolutions and to implement them like clockwork. \"This is all on the edge,\" Lauterbach said. \"If we now introduce additional loosening, if we try to distinguish ourselves as someone who loosens particularly quickly - that would be wrong.\"\n\n+++\n\nThe federal government continues to support businesses in the Corona pandemic. Corona economic aid will be extended until the end of June 2022 as a hedging instrument. New start-up assistance for the solo self-employed and hardship assistance will also continue.\n\nWith Bridging Aid IV, businesses affected by Corona-related restrictions will continue to receive comprehensive support. Corona economic aid is to be extended until the end of June 2022 in accordance with the current decision of the Federal Government and the LÃ¤nder. The complementary programmes of new start-up assistance for the solo self-employed and hardship assistance will be continued in parallel.\n\nReimbursement of fixed costs and direct grants\n\nCompanies will continue to receive a pro-rata reimbursement of fixed costs through the Bridging Assistance IV. In addition, enterprises that are particularly hard hit by the consequences of the Corona pandemic receive an equity grant.\n\nWith the \"New Start Aid 2022 Second Quarter\", solo self-employed persons can continue to receive up to 1,500 euros per month in direct subsidies until the end of June 2022, i.e. a total of up to 4,500 euros for the extended funding period from April to June 2022.\n\nPlanning security and easier transition to normality\n\n\"Business and employees need planning security and they also need continued cover in case it takes longer for business to pick up again,\" says Federal Minister of Economics Robert Habeck. The aid would take effect when necessary. If the economy picks up more quickly and they no longer have to be used, all the better, he said.\n\n\"We are once again standing by those businesses that are still affected by a slump in sales with a temporary extension of the economic aid. In this way we are easing the transition to normality for those affected, which should and must come soon,\" says Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner.\n\n+++ Thursday, 17.02.2022 +++\n\nThe German government supports the establishment and expansion of vaccine production facilities in Africa. So far, only one percent of the production sites are located there. On Wednesday, the BioNTech company and the kENUP Foundation hosted an event on the establishment and expansion of production capacities in Africa. At the beginning of the event, Chancellor Olaf Scholz emphasised: \"As European and African partners, we are working hand in hand to kick off local vaccine production in Ghana, Senegal, South Africa and Rwanda.\" Establishing local vaccine production in Africa was the topic of an internationally attended event in Marburg on Wednesday.\n\nHand in hand for local vaccine production\n\nTwo years ago, at the beginning of the Corona pandemic, no effective vaccine against the virus existed. \"Ãzlem TÃ¼reci and UÄur Åahin have made scientific history. With the rapid expansion and conversion of the Behring facilities in Marburg, BioNTech has now created one of the largest mRNA production facilities in the world,\" said Chancellor Scholz, illustrating the development of the past months. At the same time, he pointed out that \"so far, only just over half of the world's population has been fully vaccinated, and in Africa the average is only eleven per cent.\"\n\nThe concern to promote the establishment and expansion of production facilities in Africa goes back to the \"Compact with Africa\" initiative. In Berlin on 27 August 2021, BioNTech, the Institut Pasteur de Dakar (SEN) and the Rwanda Biomedical Centre as well as EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed a communiquÃ© on \"Vaccine Equity for Africa\".\n\nLocal vaccine production and better medical care\n\nCurrently, only one percent of vaccine production capacity is localised in Africa. Once completed, the production facilities will expand the production of mRNA vaccines against covid-19, malaria and tuberculosis in Ghana, Senegal, South Africa and Rwanda. The aim is to kick-start local vaccine production, sustainably improve health care and increase economic opportunities.\n\nCompact with Africa\n\nThe Compact with Africa initiative is a partnership of equals. It was launched in 2017 under the German G20 Presidency. The Compact is the core element of a new cooperation with Africa. The aim is to improve the conditions for private investment and employment opportunities in Africa together with the African partner countries.\n\nGerman G7 Presidency\n\nA major focus of the German G7 Presidency will be the global fight against COVID-19 and the promotion of investments to prevent future pandemics. The German government is not only the second largest donor to the COVAX initiative (English), but has delivered over 100 million vaccine doses from national stocks to over 30 countries worldwide.\n\n+++\n\n+++ Friday, 12.11.2021 +++\n\nThe free Corona citizen tests will be reintroduced. Federal Health Minister Spahn signed a decree to this effect. Every citizen is now entitled to at least one rapid antigen test per week.\n\nEvery citizen can once again be tested for the corona virus free of charge. A regulation of the Federal Ministry of Health, which regulates this, comes into force already on Saturday. This means that everyone will then be entitled to at least one free rapid antigen test (PoC test) per week - and this applies regardless of vaccination or recovery status.\n\nFederal Minister of Health Jens Spahn emphasized: \"Vaccination makes a decisive difference - this will continue to apply - but it takes time to develop its full effect. That's why we need to test more again quickly in this situation. To this end, it has been agreed that we will reintroduce the free rapid tests.\"\n\nExisting testing centers can continue their work. In addition, further test centers can be commissioned by the states. Spahn explained that he expects that starting next week, the range of tests on site will also be gradually expanded again.\n\nFor more information, see our Q&A on Corona testing.\n\n+++\n\nAt a joint press conference with RKI President Lothar Wieler, the acting Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn appealed urgently to take the infection situation seriously and to take countermeasures: \"Otherwise it will be a bitter December for the whole country\". Since the end of September, the R-value has been above 1. If this does not change, one must assume that the number of new infections with the coronavirus will double every fortnight.\n\nWhat such high infection figures mean with a vaccination rate that is still too low can already be seen in intensive care units in some regions in Germany - especially in Saxony, Thuringia and Bavaria. \"There are hospitals there that are already over the limit. In these regions, there is currently the risk that if you have an emergency - stroke, heart attack - the capacities that you would otherwise be used to are not always immediately available on site,\" explained Spahn.\n\nContainment measures imperative\n\nThe dynamic must be broken, said Spahn. The health ministers of the LÃ¤nder therefore already decided at the end of last week, together with the Federal Health Minister, to offer booster vaccinations for every six months after the second vaccination. They also agreed on stricter requirements and controls on access to events as well as mandatory testing concepts for nursing homes.\n\n\"But all this is not enough, at least not any more,\" said the Federal Health Minister. He pleads for additional testing obligations for staff and visitors in nursing homes, for 3G (vaccinated, recovered or tested) in the workplace and 2G (vaccinated or recovered) at public events. In addition, he said, it would be useful for convalescents and vaccinated people to be able to show an up-to-date test at events. \"2G Plus, that's another hard step, I'm very aware of that,\" Spahn said.\n\nDynamic infection - serious situation\n\n\"It is 5 past 12,\" warned the president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Wieler. In federal states with very high infection incidence, hospitals and intensive care units are already reaching their capacity limits. Wieler assumes that the situation will continue to worsen throughout Germany. He therefore urgently pleaded for additional measures to contain the incidence of infection.\n\nTo defuse the situation as quickly as possible, Wieler appealed: \"Reduce your contacts. Above all, avoid situations where several people come together indoors. Please follow the AHA-and-L rules always and everywhere, also at 2G and 3G events. So wear a mask even at 2G. If you have symptoms of acute respiratory infection, please make sure you stay at home and get tested by PCR.\"\n\n+++\n\nThe federal and state governments will again discuss the current Corona pandemic situation next Thursday, 18 Nov 2021. Chancellor Angela Merkel and Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz will meet with the heads of government of the LÃ¤nder at noon. The meeting will take place via video conference.\n\n+++\n\nThe EU states of Austria, the Czech Republic and Hungary are considered Corona high-risk areas from 0:00 on Sunday, 14 November. Exceptions in Austria are the municipalities of Mittelberg and Jungholz and the RiÃtal in the municipal area of Vomp and Eben am Achensee.\n\nThe United States of America, on the other hand, is no longer considered a high-risk area as of Sunday.\n\nObserve entry regulations\n\nPeople entering Germany from a high-risk area must fill out a digital entry form. Returnees who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered must also enter quarantine in Germany. This can be ended after five days at the earliest by a current negative coronary test.\n\n+++\n\n+++\n\nAre you interested in the latest Corona news from Germany?

Then follow us on Twitter!\n\n+++\n\n+++ Thursday, 11.11.2021 +++\n\nThe Corona warning app now offers the possibility to scan QR codes for events in the luca app.The advantage of this innovation is that organisers will no longer have to issue two different QR codes in future. Thus, it is sufficient to offer one luca QR code. For users of the Corona warning app who do not use the luca app, another important function is thus offered that makes it easier in everyday life to register for events.\n\nThe functionality and high data protection standards of the Corona warning app remain unchanged. The app still does not collect any personal data. Nor is any data transferred from the Corona warning app to the luca app. What is important to know about the implementation is that the Corona warning app can only scan luca codes generated from 25 May 2021. Operators who still use older codes must therefore update them.\n\nTwo apps, two different approaches\n\nThe Corona warning app and the luca app are still based on different approaches and pursue different goals.\n\nIn the event of an infection, the Corona warning app enables people to be warned quickly according to the peer-to-peer principle. This warning takes place anonymously via the Corona warning app itself. The luca app, on the other hand, is mainly used to digitally record the contact data of participants at an event. In the event of infection, the person who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 passes on their contact details to the responsible health authority. This then contacts all persons who have scanned the same QR code.\n\nThe respective state ordinances on infection control stipulate whether and how contact tracing must take place at events.\n\n+++ Tuesday, 9.11.2021 +++\n\n\"We have very difficult weeks ahead of us,\" emphasised Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn in view of the high infection figures and the high and increasing burden on hospitals and especially intensive care units. It is now a matter of working together to \"break this fourth wave\", he said at the end of the two-day conference of health ministers in Lindau on Lake Constance.\n\nBooster vaccinations should \"become the rule\".\n\nThe federal and state health ministers have spoken out in favour of offering booster vaccinations for all age groups. According to Spahn, this is an \"important signal\" these days, on which they also agree with the medical profession. Because: \"We need more speed\" with the so-called booster vaccinations.\n\nThis means that anyone whose second vaccination was given more than six months ago can receive the booster vaccination. In particular, older people, people with pre-existing conditions and medical and nursing staff are to be actively targeted. \"Boosters after six months should become the rule, not the exception,\" says Spahn.\n\nAs before, it is possible to get not only the initial vaccination but also the booster vaccination at doctors' surgeries. In addition, there should be further offers by the LÃ¤nder and municipalities, for example mobile offers such as vaccination buses, but also vaccination centres.\n\nThe Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) recommends a booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine (at the earliest six months after the second vaccination) for people who are particularly at risk. This concerns, among others, everyone over 70, people in nursing homes and the immunodeficient. In addition to this recommendation, everyone over the age of twelve can receive a booster vaccination six months after the second vaccination.\n\n\"2 G\" as an option for regions with a high incidence of infection\n\nThe \"3-G\" rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), which has been applied in many places so far, has now become even more important as an entry requirement for indoor events, for example. However, there is agreement that the implementation of this rule needs to be better controlled.\n\nFor certain regions with a very high incidence of infection, there is also the option of applying the \"2-G\" rule (vaccinated or recovered). Some LÃ¤nder had already introduced this rule in some cases, and now for the first time there was consensus between the federal government and all the LÃ¤nder that this option should be available in some particularly burdened regions.\n\nTests in nursing homes, also for vaccinated and convalescent patients\n\nIn future, tests will be compulsory in nursing homes, also for vaccinated and convalescent patients. This applies to both staff and visitors.\n\nAccording to Spahn, the aim is to \"protect the places where the particularly vulnerable live\". This is to prevent the virus from being carried into the facilities.\n\n+++ Thursday, 04.11.2021 +++\n\n\"The pandemic is obviously not only still here, but the fourth wave is doing so with particular force,\" said Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn on the current situation of the Corona pandemic. At present, it is \"primarily a pandemic of the unvaccinated - and it is massive\", said Spahn. Since not enough people have been vaccinated and behavioural instructions to protect against infection as well as the 2G and 3G rules are no longer sufficiently implemented, the wave is unfortunately developing exactly as feared, added the President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) Lothar Wieler.\n\nWith the recent surge in the number of infections, not only the number of deaths has risen - more people are being treated in hospitals and intensive care units. Therefore, state protection and personal responsibility are now needed. Spahn said the biggest challenge was that the vast number of people who had not yet been vaccinated could hardly be persuaded to get vaccinated after all.\n\nThree points to contain pandemic in autumn and winter\n\nIn order to break the fourth wave, the minister presented three points, the implementation of which he will discuss with the health ministers of the federal states on Thursday and Friday.\n\n1. consistently adhere to precautionary measures that have been adopted\n\nSpahn appealed to keep distance and hygiene rules and to implement 3G and 2G models. He called for consistent monitoring by the authorities and for fines to be imposed for violations. In regions where the incidence of infection is particularly high, the 2G model (vaccinated and recovered) must be enforced. This has nothing to do with vaccination bullying, but protects against overloading the health system, said Spahn.\n\n2. compulsory testing concepts for nursing homes\n\nSince residents of nursing homes are particularly vulnerable people, Spahn advocated mandatory testing regardless of vaccination status. Testing would apply to staff and visitors who could carry the virus into the facility. \"I don't want to have to experience dying in nursing homes again like last winter,\" Spahn said.\n\n3. increase the pace of booster vaccination\n\nThe number of booster vaccinations must increase quickly, he said. \"The pace of boosting is not enough,\" Spahn said. The Minister referred to the agreement of the Conference of Health Ministers to offer a booster vaccination to all residents in care facilities, the staff there and all people over 60. The two million booster vaccinations that have now been achieved are \"clearly too few\".\n\nSolidarity remains the order of the day\n\nRKI President Wieler also called once again for vaccination and compliance with the AHA+L rules. He made it clear that the vaccination does not have the same effect on all vaccinated people and that the vaccination protection can diminish over time, especially in older people who are already very vulnerable. Nevertheless, Wieler said, solidarity remains the order of the day. \"We all want this winter to be the last winter of the Covid 19 pandemic,\" Wieler said. For this reason, everyone bears responsibility for the further development of the fourth wave. With vaccination and compliance, many lives could be saved, he added.\n\n+++\n\nIn Romania, many hospitals are currently overloaded due to the high number of Corona cases - especially the emergency rooms and intensive care units. Germany and other European countries have therefore promised help.\n\nWith the support of the German Armed Forces' AirMedEvac aircraft, a total of 18 intensive care patients have been brought to Germany in the last three days and are now receiving further intensive care treatment in North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Bavaria.\n\nContact tracing operations intensified again\n\nDomestically, the Bundeswehr is also continuing to provide support in coping with the pandemic. Currently, about 190 soldiers are active in 45 measures within the framework of administrative assistance. The soldiers are also increasingly involved in contact tracing at health offices. Due to the rising number of infections, the number of requests for administrative assistance has also increased slightly.\n\n+++\n\nWith the update to version 2.13, the Corona warning app gets a recycle bin function for certificates. It keeps deleted certificates for the time being and users can thus also restore them. The 7-day incidence of hospitalisation is now also displayed on a local level and the assignment of certificates to persons is now more error-tolerant.\n\nManage certificates better\n\nVersion 2.13 adds a recycle bin function for certificates to the Corona Warn app. The expansion of the certificate section of the app into a so-called wallet through update 2.5 made it possible to display different digital certificate types (vaccination or convalescent status, PCR or rapid test result). However, if users delete these certificates now, the virtual recycle bin keeps them for another 30 days. Accidentally deleted ones can thus be restored.\n\nIn addition, the allocation of certificates has been improved. The Corona warning app now assigns certificates that have a different number of spaces between the person's first and last name to the same person. Previously, this spelling error caused the Corona Warning app to assign these certificates to two different people.\n\nHospitalisation rate and number of COVID-19 sufferers in intensive care units\n\nTo ensure that users can continue to find out about all the important key figures of the pandemic in the app, the statistics section was expanded with the update to version 2.12. There, the 7-day hospitalisation rate and the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units can also be found. There, the 7-day incidence of hospitalisation and the number of people infected with Covid 19 in intensive care units can also be found. With version 2.13, the 7-day incidence of hospitalisation is now also displayed at the level of the federal states.\n\n+++ Monday, 01.11.2021 +++\n\nThe Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has recorded a clear trend since the end of September: new infections with the coronavirus are on the rise again. Compared to the previous week, the 7-day incidence in all age groups currently increased significantly. High 7-day incidences were observed in the age groups of 5- to 49-year-olds as well as in those over 90 years of age. This is shown in the current RKI status report on Covid-19.\n\nThe incidence of hospitalised cases and the number of Covid-19 cases in intensive care units also increased, according to the report, and a significantly higher number of reported outbreaks in medical facilities and in homes for the elderly and nursing homes were recorded.\n\nComplete vaccination protection is important\n\nIn the situation report, the RKI points out that with the current 7-day incidences, there is an increasing probability of infectious contacts. Therefore, it is urgently recommended to take advantage of the vaccination offer against Covid-19 and to ensure complete vaccination protection - i.e. to also have the second vaccination, which is provided with almost all Corona vaccines. The option of a booster vaccination should also be used by people for whom the Standing Committee on Vaccination recommends this.\n\nIn case of mild symptoms, affected people should stay at home and get tested, if possible with a PCR test - even vaccinated people. In addition, the RKI asked all people to consistently follow the AHA+L rules (keep your distance, observe hygiene, wear a mask in everyday life, ventilate regularly), avoid situations especially indoors where so-called super-spreading events can occur, reduce unnecessary contact and continue to use the Corona warning app.\n\n+++ Thursday, 28.10.2021 +++\n\nThe economic recovery after the Corona crisis year 2020 continues. Next year, the federal government expects an increase in the gross domestic product of 4.1 percent. In 2021, the economy is expected to grow by 2.6 percent. This is according to the Federal Government's autumn report.\n\nSlightly lower growth in 2021\n\n\"The German economy is on the upswing,\" emphasised Federal Minister of Economics Altmaier at the presentation of the Federal Government's Autumn Report. The gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to increase by 2.6 percent in 2021. In 2022, growth of as much as 4.1 percent is possible, until it normalises at 1.6 percent in 2023.\n\nThis means that the economic recovery in 2021, after the sharp slump in the economy last year, will be somewhat lower than the federal government expected at the end of April. Current supply bottlenecks and high energy prices are equally dampening economic development in Europe and worldwide, Altmaier said.\n\n2022 back to performance strength ahead of Corona\n\nNext year, however, the economy is expected to pick up considerable speed again. In concrete terms, the government expects growth of 4.1 per cent, which is 0.5 points more than previously thought. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, the German economy would then already have reached its pre-Corona pandemic performance level, according to Federal Economics Minister Altmaier.\"The autumn projection shows that Germany is back on the growth path after the Corona crisis. The Federal Government's extensive aid package has stabilised the economy and the labour market during the crisis,\" Altmaier emphasised.\n\n+++ Wednesday, 20.2021 +++\n\nWith version 2.12 of the Corona warning app, the universal QR code scanner has been integrated into the tab at the bottom of the screen. The function can now be accessed more quickly and centrally. At the same time, the QR code scanner remains in the familiar locations in the Corona Warning app. Since version 2.11, users have already been able to scan all QR codes supported by the Corona warning app, regardless of whether they are tests, certificates or check-ins. In the course of this, the icons on the tab have also been adapted. Users can now reach the start screen via \"Status\".\n\nHospitalisation rate and number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units\n\nThe statistics section has also been expanded so that users can continue to find out about all the important key figures on the pandemic in the app. The 7-day incidence of hospitalisation and the number of people infected with Covid 19 in intensive care units can now also be found there. The 7-day incidence of hospitalisation refers to the number of people who come to a hospital because of a Covid 19 diagnosis. It maps the transmitted cases over one week per 100,000 population. The number of covid-19 patients in intensive care units indicates the proportion of covid patients in the occupancy of intensive care beds in Germany.\n\nUnified message settings and import of QR codes\n\nIn addition, the message settings have been standardised in the new version. As with other apps, users can now precisely define settings for notifications of the Corona warning app in the device settings of their smartphone. There, they can not only switch notifications on or off as before, but also define individual notification types. There is another innovation for iOS users: they can now also import supported QR codes from images or PDF documents. After opening the QR code scanner, they can select \"Open file\" at the bottom left and import a QR code from their image or file library. For Android users, this function has already been available since version 2.11.\n\n+++ Thursday, 14.10.2021 +++\n\nThe economy has recovered significantly, but some industries continue to experience Corona-related losses. The federal government had therefore extended the Bridging Assistance III Plus as well as the Restart Assistance Plus until December 31, 2021. Affected companies and solo self-employed persons can now submit applications for the extended ÃberbrÃ¼ckungshilfe III Plus and Neustarthilfe Plus for the funding period October to December 2021.\n\nThe German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology announced in a press release that companies affected by sales losses and wishing to take advantage of the Bridging Assistance III Plus for the extended period until the end of the year can now submit their applications for it. The same applies to solo self-employed persons and the New Start-up Assistance Plus. Applications can be submitted via the familiar platform www.ueberbrueckungshilfe-unternehmen.de. The relevant funding conditions are published in the form of FAQs on the platform.\n\nProven promotion continued\n\nWith more than 100 billion in aid disbursed, Bridging Assistance I, II, III and III Plus have been a key aid tool in the Corona pandemic. The federal government is continuing this assistance, for those who still need it. The content of the Bridging Assistance III Plus, which is extended through the end of the year, is largely the same as the Bridging Assistance III Plus for July, August, and September.\n\nCompanies with a Corona-related drop in sales of at least 30 percent are also eligible to apply for the extended Bridging Assistance III Plus. In addition, all those businesses eligible to apply for Bridging Assistance III in June 2021 that were affected by the flooding in July are eligible to apply. Application processing and disbursement are the responsibility of the states.\n\nRestart aid remains\n\nThe so-called Restart Premium, which was intended to specifically ease the transition from lockdown to reopening within the Bridging Assistance III Plus program by providing a personnel cost subsidy, has fulfilled its purpose. It expired on schedule at the end of September.\n\nThe equity subsidy, which is intended to strengthen the substance of companies that have been particularly hard hit and are still affected, will continue to be available beyond September until December 2021. The New Start-Up Assistance Plus for the self-employed will also be extended. For the period from October to December, solo self-employed persons whose sales are further restricted by Corona can thus receive additional support of up to 4,500 euros. Eligible for the direct application Neustarthilfe Plus, are - as before - solo self-employed with or without partnerships as well as other groups of persons, such as so-called short term employees in the performing arts and independent employees. The prerequisite is in particular that the self-employment is carried out as a main occupation and that no more than one part-time employee is employed.\n\n+++ Friday, 08.10.2021 +++\n\nThe German vaccination campaign is more successful than previously assumed. This is confirmed by figures from the Robert Koch Institute. These show that up to five percent more citizens in Germany are vaccinated than can be seen in the reporting data.\n\nAccording to a new survey by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the vaccination rate among adults in Germany is higher than previously assumed. In the evaluation of the RKI's vaccination rate monitoring (COVIMO), \"in the adult population, a proportion of up to 84 percent who have been vaccinated at least once and a proportion of up to 80 percent who have been fully vaccinated can be assumed\".\n\nThe discrepancy between the reported vaccinations and the current findings of the RKI apparently results from the fact that vaccinations have not been reported. Gaps were found, among others, among company doctors or also during missions of the mobile vaccination teams, such as in old people's homes. \"That can always happen in such a large campaign,\" said Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Rate Monitoring in Germany (COVIMO)\n\nSince January 2021, the Robert Koch Institute has been monitoring COVID-19 vaccination rates as well as COVID-19 vaccination readiness and acceptance by means of telephone surveys in Germany. The last survey took place between 26.07.21 and 18.08.21. 1,005 adults were interviewed about corona vaccination. This is the 7th survey conducted by the RKI.\n\n+++\n\nDue to the current infection situation, some regions - including Estonia and Latvia - will be reclassified as high-risk areas as of Sunday. For other countries, however, this classification will be lifted. Since 1 August, the rules of the new entry regulation apply to all travellers.\n\nThe EU states Estonia and Latvia as well as Ukraine will be considered Corona high-risk areas from Sunday, 10 October.\n\nThe two non-European states Yemen and Brunei Darussalam are also now classified as high-risk areas.\n\nThe French overseas territories of French Polynesia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. BarthÃ©lemy and St. Martin, on the other hand, will no longer be considered high-risk areas as of Sunday. The same applies to the Norwegian provinces of Oslo and Viken as well as some other regions.\n\nObserve new entry regulations\n\nPeople entering Germany from a high-risk area must fill out a digital entry form. Returnees who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered must also go into quarantine in Germany. This can be ended after five days at the earliest by a current negative coronary test.\n\nThis list shows which states or regions are currently classified as virus variant or high-risk areas.\n\nThe most important regulations of the entry regulation in force since 1 August 2021 can be found here.\n\nThe classification of high-risk areas and virus variant areas is carried out by the Federal Ministry of Health in agreement with the Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Ministry of the Interior, for Construction and Home Affairs for areas outside the Federal Republic of Germany for which a particularly increased risk of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been identified.\n\n+++ Wednesday, 06.10.2021 +++\n\n\"Please get vaccinated against influenza,\" appealed Federal Health Minister Spahn at the start of the flu season. With a vaccination, you protect yourself, but also help to ensure that the health system is not overburdened. It is possible to be vaccinated against both influenza and corona at the same time: \"Double vaccination also leads to double protection.\n\nThis year it is especially important to get vaccinated against influenza, said Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn at a joint press conference with RKI President Lothar Wieler and STIKO Chairman Thomas Mertens.\n\nFlu is not a harmless disease\n\nThe flu is not a harmless disease, but can take a very serious, sometimes fatal course, especially in those who have already been ill or are elderly. One can protect oneself against this with a vaccination.\n\nBut one also helps \"to ensure that the health system does not come under too much strain this autumn and winter\", said Spahn. RKI President Wieler stressed the need to prevent \"too many COVID-19 cases and many flu cases occurring in parallel in winter\".\n\n27 million flu vaccine doses available\n\n\"More than enough\" flu vaccines are available for the autumn, he said. 27 million vaccine doses had been ordered - after 22 million vaccinations last autumn, more people in Germany had been vaccinated against influenza than ever before.\n\nIn contrast to last year, the vaccine doses will be available early so that the demand can be met without waiting times.\n\nSTIKO: Flu and Corona vaccination possible at the same time\n\n\"Those who have not yet had a Corona vaccination or need a booster can combine it at the same time as the flu vaccination,\" said Spahn.\n\nThis is because the STIKO has issued a new vaccination recommendation for the start of the flu season: The flu vaccination and the Corona vaccination can be given at the same time, there is no minimum interval between the two vaccinations. In particular, those who have not yet received a vaccination can thus effectively protect themselves from sometimes severe illnesses in autumn and winter.\n\nContinue to adhere to AHA-plus-L rules\n\nIt is still important, also for protection against flu viruses, to observe the AHA-plus-L rules. For example, wearing medical protective masks in public transport makes a difference against both corona and flu viruses, the Federal Minister of Health emphasised.\n\nThe more at-risk patients were vaccinated against influenza and the more people were vaccinated against COVID-19 and the more people adhered to the AHA-plus-L rules, \"the better we will get through this autumn and this winter\", said RKI President Wieler.\n\n+++\n\nWith the update to version 2.11, the Corona warning app receives a universal QR code scanner. This allows users to scan all QR codes supported by the warning app at any point within the app. The Corona Warning app recognises what it is about and automatically saves the certificate or event registration in the right place.\n\nUntil now, users could only use the respective QR code scanner of the Corona Warning app for a specific assigned purpose, for example, to add vaccination, convalescent or test certificates under \"Certificates\", but not to register for events there. With the new version 2.11, the Corona-Warn app can now scan all QR codes it supports anywhere in the app and automatically save them in the right place.\n\nExample: Users can now select the function \"Scan QR code\" under the heading \"Check-in\" and use it to scan a digital vaccination certificate, for example. The Corona Warning app recognises that it is a vaccination certificate and saves it accordingly under \"Certificates\". Previously, the Corona Warning app could not read the QR code in this case because it would only have accepted registrations for events at this point.\n\nImporting QR codes from files\n\nUsers of Android devices also have the option of importing QR codes from photos or PDF files via the QR code scanner in future and no longer necessarily have to scan them with the camera.\n\nTo do this, they can open any QR code scanner in the Corona Warning app. After clicking on \"Scan QR code\", it is possible to select \"Open file\" at the bottom left and import a QR code from your image or file library. The Corona Warning app reads the QR code on the image or file and saves the certificate, test or event in the corresponding area of the Corona Warning app, depending on the type of QR code.\n\nFor iOS users, this function will be available promptly from version 2.12.\n\n+++ Tuesday, 05.10.2021 +++\n\nMost non-vaccinated people should no longer receive compensation for an ordered Corona quarantine from 1 November at the latest. This was decided by the federal and state health ministers.\n\nIn the meantime, there is enough vaccine so that basically everyone who wants to can be vaccinated against Covid-19. Therefore, in future, no compensation will be paid in all federal states in the event of an ordered quarantine due to Covid-19 for unvaccinated people - at the latest from 1 November. This was decided by the federal and state health ministers on Wednesday.\n\nThere are to be two exceptions:\n\n- Someone cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and has a certificate to that effect.\n\n- Or he or she belongs to a group of people for whom there was no public recommendation for vaccination against Covid-19 in a period of up to eight weeks before the segregation order was issued.\n\nInfection Protection Act is applied\n\nFor Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn, the decision is a question of fairness towards those who have been vaccinated: \"Why should others pay for someone deciding for themselves not to be vaccinated?\"\n\nThe decision is about an application of a passage of the Infection Protection Act in paragraph 56, which already existed before the Corona pandemic: Anyone who could have avoided quarantine by getting a recommended vaccination can be exempted from compensation. For example, after a trip to the tropics.\n\n+++ Monday, 27.09.2021 +++\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research is providing 6.5 million euros for research into corona late effects. Ten projects will be funded - among others on outpatient care, rehabilitation and nursing as well as on the cooperation between specialised Long Covid outpatient clinics and general practitioners.\n\nFederal Research Minister Anja Karliczek emphasises the urgency of researching late symptoms of Covid-19 (Long-Covid) - also because the pandemic is not yet over. \"Very many Covid-19 patients are still suffering from symptoms weeks or months afterwards - regardless of the severity of the course of the disease,\" says Karliczek. Providing the best possible care for these people remains a challenge for doctors and, in a special way, for science.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research has now selected ten projects that pursue different approaches and will fund them for a period of usually two years. 6.5 million euros are available for this. This is 1.5 million euros more than originally planned with the \"Guideline for the funding of research projects on late symptoms of Covid-19\" from May 2021. Of particular importance are projects on outpatient care, rehabilitation and care and on cooperation between specialised Long Covid outpatient clinics and GP primary care.\n\nIt is estimated that about ten percent of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience long-term symptoms that can last several weeks or months. The most common late symptoms include extreme exhaustion, headaches, lack of concentration, shortness of breath and loss of the sense of smell and taste.\n\n+++ Thursday, 23.09.2021 +++\n\nIn view of the worldwide dynamic infection rate, it remains necessary to continue necessary and proven protective measures against the further spread of the coronavirus. Therefore, the Federal Cabinet last decided on 22 September to extend the regulation on entry quarantine up to and including 10 November 2021.\n\nSince 28 July:\n\n- People entering the country from a new virus variant area can now end their mandatory 14-day quarantine early with a negative Corona test, provided the region they are coming from is downgraded to a risk area or a high-incidence area during the quarantine period. Early free testing is otherwise not possible for people entering Germany.\n\n- Those who have full vaccination protection can then end their quarantine by sending the vaccination certificate if the Robert Koch Institute determines and publishes on its website that this vaccine is sufficiently effective against the virus variant that led to the area being classified as a virus variant area.\n\nAlmost all countries in the world are still affected by the Covid 19 pandemic. Travel and border traffic can contribute to the faster spread of the corona virus in Germany and to the emergence of new foci of infection. The aim of the Corona Virus Entry Ordinance is to prevent this.\n\nSince mid-May, the ordinance has brought together the various elements on the topic of entry in a uniform and comprehensive manner throughout Germany. It regulates the registration, testing and verification obligations as well as the quarantine regulations after entry.\n\nMost non-vaccinated persons should no longer receive compensation in the event of an ordered Corona quarantine from 1 November at the latest. This was decided by the federal and state health ministers. In the meantime, there is enough vaccine so that basically everyone who wants to can be vaccinated against Covid-19. Therefore, in future, no compensation will be paid in all federal states in the event of an ordered quarantine due to Covid-19 for unvaccinated people - at the latest from 1 November. This was decided by the federal and state health ministers on Wednesday.\n\nThere are to be two exceptions:\n\n- Someone cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and has a certificate to that effect.\n\n- Or he or she belongs to a group of people for whom there was no public recommendation for vaccination against Covid-19 in a period of up to eight weeks before the segregation order was issued.\n\nInfection Protection Act is applied\n\nFor Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn, the decision is a question of fairness towards those who have been vaccinated: \"Why should others pay for someone deciding for themselves not to be vaccinated?\"\n\nThe decision is about an application of a passage of the Infection Protection Act in paragraph 56, which already existed before the Corona pandemic: Anyone who could have avoided quarantine by getting a recommended vaccination can be exempted from compensation. For example, after a trip to the tropics.\n\nHowever, anyone who falls ill with Covid-19 and is unable to work is entitled to continued payment of wages and, if applicable, sick pay in the event of illness - even if he or she was not vaccinated.\n\n+++ Tuesday, 21.09.2021 +++\n\nThere are still no official rules on the need for booster vaccinations. However, with the update to version 2.10, the Corona Warning App is already ready to implement possible rules and quickly inform users who need a booster. In addition, vaccination certificates will also be available as PDF documents in the future.\n\nInformation on booster vaccination\n\nWith the 2.10 update, the Corona Warning app is ready to quickly inform users about any upcoming booster vaccinations. While there are still no official regulations on the need for booster vaccinations. However, with the update to version 2.10, the app can already implement possible rules and inform users who need a booster.\n\nSince update 2.9, users who have received a booster vaccination can transfer it to the Corona-Warn app. The project team behind Corona-Warn-App continues to adapt the app to current pandemic events. Updates are currently being made in a two-week rhythm. Six more updates are planned by the end of the year.\n\nSave, share, print vaccination certificates\n\nWith version 2.10, there will be a print version of the vaccination certificates in the app in the future. This will make it possible to save the certificate as a PDF document, send it or print it out again. This function is also useful in case the original document from the pharmacy or vaccination centre has been lost. A certificate wallet has been available in the Corona Warning app since version 2.5. In the wallet, tested, vaccinated and recovered users can integrate digital vaccination certificates or test results in the form of QR codes and then show them.\n\n+++ Wednesday, 15.09.2021 +++\n\nThe number of people who have to be treated in hospital because of Covid-19 will become a central indicator for assessing the incidence of infection. In sensitive areas such as nursing homes, day-care centres and schools, employees may be asked about their vaccination status in future. After the Bundesrat gave its approval, the regulations have now come into force.\n\nAs the vaccination coverage of the population increases, the significance of the seven-day incidence of new infections changes. In future, therefore, the main indicator for deciding on protective measures that the Laender can take according to Â§ 28a of the Infection Protection Act will above all be the hospitalisation incidence. The hospitalisation incidence reflects the number of Covid 19 patients admitted as inpatients for treatment in the past seven days per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nOther indicators for assessing the infection situation are: the seven-day incidence of new infections differentiated by age, the available intensive care treatment capacities and the number of persons vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nInformation on vaccination status\n\nThe amended Infection Protection Act also requires employees in certain facilities to provide information on their vaccination or serostatus (recovery), namely facilities and companies where particularly vulnerable groups of people are cared for or accommodated, or where numerous people are exposed to a risk of infection due to spatial proximity. These are, for example, nursing homes, shelters for the homeless, but also schools and day-care centres. A corresponding regulation for hospitals and other medical facilities already exists.\n\nThis allows the facilities to organise their work in such a way that the risk of infection is kept as low as possible. This regulation does not imply an obligation to vaccinate.\n\nThe Bundestag had passed this amendment to the Infection Protection Act on Tuesday, 7 September 2021, as part of the legislation on reconstruction aid to deal with the consequences of the devastating July floods. On Friday, 10 September, the Bundesrat approved it.\n\n+++\n\nEven during the pandemic, children and young people need open schools and day-care centres and sports facilities in their free time. A working group of the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs and the Federal Ministry of Health points this out. How the youngest are to be better supported during and after the pandemic was reported on in the cabinet on Wednesday.\n\nChildren and young people are particularly affected by the impact of the Corona pandemic due to school and day-care closures as well as restricted leisure activities. At the same time, lack of social interaction with peers, excessive media consumption, lack of physical activity and other factors pose a risk to the healthy development of children and youth during the pandemic.\n\nAn interministerial working group of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Family Affairs, together with numerous experts, has therefore developed recommendations for action to avoid future burdens for children and adolescents as far as possible and to reduce existing ones. On Wednesday, this was reported to the Federal Cabinet.\n\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn said: \"Children and young people have suffered particularly from the pandemic. We want to give them special support on their way back to normality and invest more in prevention and screening. This also includes more preventive check-ups to detect psychological and physical problems of adolescents at an early stage.\"\n\nFederal Minister for Family Affairs Christine Lambrecht explained: \"Unfortunately, the effects of the pandemic hit children and young people particularly hard, especially those who already had a hard time before. We have to take special care of them. It is especially important for these children that day-care centres, schools, sports facilities and youth centres are open and remain open. With our catch-up programme, we give children and young people the opportunity to leave the pandemic behind: with educational and recreational opportunities that now help them overcome loneliness, lack of exercise and learning gaps.\"\n\nAmong other things, the report describes these points\n\n- The top priority is to avoid area-wide closures of education and care facilities, but without endangering the health of children and young people.\n\n- Beyond school and day-care centres, children need sport and exercise and other leisure activities as a balance. LÃ¤nder and municipalities should ensure that sport in particular - even under pandemic conditions, for example outdoors - continues to be possible.\n\n- In addition, preventive health promotion offers should be made more accessible to children and adolescents. The aim is for the LÃ¤nder and municipalities, together with the health insurance funds and other local providers, to promote the revival and expansion of offers for children and adolescents, with a focus on preventing and combating risks such as lack of exercise, malnutrition and also stress symptoms in children and adolescents.\n\n- Children and adolescents who were already exposed to increased stress and particularly affected before the pandemic are to receive targeted support.\n\n- In addition, a comprehensive range of tests for daycare centres and schools is to be maintained.\n\n+++\n\n+++ Wednesday, 08 September 2021 +++\n\nThe number of people who have to be treated in hospital because of Covid-19 will become a central indicator for assessing the incidence of infection. In sensitive areas such as nursing homes or day-care centres and schools, employees may be asked about their vaccination status in future. This has been decided by the German Bundestag.\n\nAs the vaccination coverage of the population increases, the significance of the seven-day incidence of new infections changes. In future, therefore, the main indicator for deciding on protective measures that the LÃ¤nder can take according to Â§ 28a of the Infection Protection Act will be the hospitalisation incidence. The hospitalisation incidence reflects the number of Covid 19 patients admitted as inpatients for treatment in the past seven days per 100,000 inhabitants. Other indicators for assessing the infection situation are: the seven-day incidence of new infections differentiated by age, the available intensive care treatment capacities and the number of persons vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nInformation on vaccination status\n\nThe amended Infection Protection Act also requires employees in certain facilities to provide information on their vaccination or serostatus (recovery), namely facilities and companies where particularly vulnerable groups of people are cared for or accommodated, or where numerous people are exposed to a risk of infection due to spatial proximity. These are, for example, nursing homes, shelters for the homeless, but also schools and day-care centres. A corresponding regulation for hospitals and other medical facilities already exists. This allows the facilities to organise their work in such a way that the risk of infection is kept as low as possible. This regulation does not imply an obligation to vaccinate.\n\n+++ Tuesday, 07 September 2021 +++\n\nThe Federal Government wants to fund six projects for the development of drugs against Covid-19 with up to 150 million euros. \"We are optimistic that at the end of the tests there will actually be effective drugs that can then be approved,\" said Federal Research Minister Karliczek.\n\n\"We will have to live with the virus,\" emphasised Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn at a joint press conference with Federal Research Minister Anja Karliczek. \"We are just inoculating ourselves back into freedom and normality,\" said Spahn. However, there will always be people who will fall ill with Covid-19.\n\nVaccination protects - medication helps with the disease\n\n\"The delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus clearly shows us that we will unfortunately have to reckon with people falling ill with Covid-19 again and again in the future,\" Karliczek emphasised and emphatically promoted vaccination. However, there are people who cannot or do not want to be vaccinated and there are those who become infected despite vaccination. Therefore, more effective medicines are needed to treat those who fall ill, she continued.\n\n\"We also want to take the horror out of the pandemic in the long term,\" Spahn said. \"That's why we are promoting the development of new medicines so that we can continue to treat Corona patients well in the future. And we are investing in the future because we are also strengthening the German research and development location in the field of biotechnology.\"\n\nHowever, Karliczek emphasised that there will not be a single drug for corona. Rather, a mix of effective preparations is necessary to help patients effectively, depending on the stage of their disease. Six small and medium-sized biotech companies will therefore receive funding for the development of their products.\n\nUp to 150 million euros for the most promising projects\n\nA 20-member expert commission headed by the President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Professor Dr Klaus Cichotek, had reviewed the submitted proposals and selected the most promising ones, he said. \"We plan to support the projects of the coordinating companies AdrenoMed AG, Apogenix AG, Atriva Therapeutics GmbH, CORAT Therapeutics GmbH, InflaRX GmbH and DRK Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg-Hessen gGmbH with a total funding amount of up to 150 million euros,\" Karliczek announced.\n\nFunding will be provided for projects that are already at an advanced stage of clinical development and should be funded until they are approved. Studies are planned with both moderately and severely to critically ill ventilated patients. Among other things, treatment with antibodies and blocking molecules will be investigated. According to Karliczek, some of the drugs have already been researched for diseases such as cancer or sepsis.\n\nHowever, the Federal Research Minister warned against exaggerated expectations. When the new drugs will be available is still open, she said, and depends above all on their effectiveness in clinical trials. \"Ideally, some of the projects are planning a conditional approval, which could possibly become valid as early as next year,\" Karliczek said.\n\nOn 14 May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry of Research had jointly published the announcement of a \"Guideline to promote the clinical development of Covid-19 medicinal products close to the point of care and their manufacturing capacities\". The aim of this guideline is to ensure that candidates for new drugs that have been successfully tested in clinical phases I and II reach patients in Germany as quickly as possible.\n\n+++ Thursday, 26.08.2021 +++\n\nThe Bundestag has determined that the epidemic situation of national scope persists. This means that regulations can apply beyond 11 September that serve to protect public health and manage the pandemic-related effects on health and care. For example, regulations on vaccination or occupational health and safety.\n\nThe determination of the epidemic situation of national scope is also a prerequisite for the special measures that the federal states can enact on the basis of the Infection Protection Act to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe pandemic is not over yet\n\nIn Germany, the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing again. Since the beginning of July, the R-value has been above 1. Other important indicators for assessing the infection situation are also rising: the rate of positive PCR tests in relation to all PCR tests, the 7-day incidence, hospitalisations and the necessary treatments in intensive care units. Germany must prepare itself for the fact that the numbers will also continue to increase.\n\nMore and more people are vaccinated and thus well protected against COVID-19. Therefore, the number of those who need hospital treatment - unlike last winter - is only increasing moderately. It is now important that this remains the case. For the aim continues to be - as the motion in the German Bundestag states - \"to reduce as far as possible the serious threat to public health throughout the Federal Republic of Germany by using appropriate and situation-specific protective measures to combat the spread of the pandemic in order to protect life and health and to prevent the health system from being overburdened\".\n\nVaccinated people well protected\n\nThe Robert Koch Institute continues to assess the risk to the health of the unvaccinated or only once vaccinated population in Germany as high overall. For those who have been fully vaccinated, the risk is considered moderate.\n\nThe Bundestag decision of 25 August 2021 is the fifth extension. For the first time, the Bundestag had determined the epidemic situation of national importance on 25 March 2020, and the determination was extended on 18 November 2020, on 4 March 2021 and on 11 June.\n\nThe declaration of an epidemic situation of national importance is deemed to be revoked if the German Bundestag does not resolve its continuation no later than three months after its declaration. Pandemic-related ordinances, statutory orders and the compensation scheme for working parents are linked to the determination of this epidemic situation.\n\n+++ Tuesday, 17.08.2021 +++\n\nThe Standing Commission on Vaccination (Stiko) has decided to update its previous assessment and issue a general Covid 19 vaccination recommendation for 12- to 17-year-olds. It thus expands its previous vaccination recommendation, according to which only children and adolescents with pre-existing diseases and an associated increased risk of a severe course of Covid 19 disease should be vaccinated against Corona. The draft decision has now entered the mandatory commenting procedure.\n\nThe new recommendation is primarily aimed at the direct protection of vaccinated children and adolescents against Covid-19, the Stiko said in its statement. The delta variant, which dominates in Germany, poses a significantly higher risk of corona infection for them in a possible fourth wave of infection, it said.\n\n\"Parents and adolescents thus have a clear recommendation to opt for vaccination,\" said Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn. \"The facts speak for vaccination, sufficient vaccine is available for all age groups.\" If desired, vaccination could take place this week, he added.\n\nFederal Family Minister Christine Lambrecht stressed, \"The vaccination recommendation by the Stiko for all 12 to 17 year olds is a very important step in the fight against the Corona pandemic.\" Now there is a clear orientation for parents and children based on scientific evidence. \"The recommendation makes the decision easier for parents and their children,\" Lampbrecht said.\n\nVaccination still subject to medical information\n\nVaccination should continue to be carried out after a doctor has explained the benefits and risks. The independent committee is also expressly against making vaccination a prerequisite for social participation for children and adolescents.\n\nThe federal states offer vaccinations for 12 to 17 year olds. Children and adolescents can be vaccinated in vaccination centres, by established paediatricians, adolescents' doctors and general practitioners and, as relatives of employees, also by company doctors.\n\nThe Stiko is independent and develops the best possible vaccination recommendations for the population in Germany exclusively on the basis of the available scientific evidence. It always takes into account the current national and international state of knowledge and continuously develops its Covid 19 vaccination recommendation accordingly.\n\n+++\n\nSince version 2.5, the Corona warning app has a certificate wallet in which tested, vaccinated and recovered users can integrate digital certificates in the form of QR codes and then present them. To ensure that only certificates issued by an authorised body are imported, the app now checks whether the corresponding certificates are genuine. This check is carried out automatically, both for certificates that are newly imported and for those that already exist in the app.\n\nMore overview by displaying the expiry dates of certificates\n\nAnother new feature is that users will in future be able to see the technical expiry date of their vaccination, test and convalescent certificates in the overview of their digital Covid certificates. For example, a technically expired certificate can no longer be used as valid proof for travel within the EU. However, it does not necessarily mean that the user no longer has sufficient vaccination protection. If a certificate in the wallet has expired, users only need new digital proof of their vaccination or recovery.\n\nIn future, the Corona warning app will inform users 28 days before the technical expiry of a certificate, both in the app and via a push message. As soon as a certificate has expired, it will notify users again. There is no notification for expired test certificates, as these - depending on the type of test - are only valid as proof for a few days anyway.\n\n+++ Tuesday, 10.08.2021 +++\n\nThe federal government and the federal states have agreed on how to proceed in the Corona pandemic. The concrete implementation is up to the federal states, which can set their own rules.\n\nTESTS: Free citizen tests financed by the federal government are to be discontinued as of 11 October. Reason: There is free vaccination. However, for pregnant women, children and adolescents under 18 and other people for whom there is no general vaccination recommendation, rapid antigen tests are to remain free of charge.\n\n\"3G RULE\": For certain institutions and recreational facilities, the so called 3G rule is to apply from 23 August at the latest: Only vaccinated (Geimpfte), recovered (Genesene) or negatively tested (Getestete) persons will have access. This is to be the case in clinics, nursing homes, fitness studios, swimming pools, hairdressers, hotels and indoors, for example in restaurants or at events.\n\nThe test must not be older than 24 hours (antigen test) or 48 hours (PCR). Children up to the age of six and schoolchildren are exempt from the rule, as regular testing is to continue at schools anyway. And the \"3G rule\" can be suspended if the seven-day incidence in a county is \"stable\" below 35.\n\nCORONA INDICATORS: In the Federal-LÃ¤nder decision, the number of hospital admissions due to Covid-19 is described as an \"important parameter for assessing the incidence of infection\". In addition, it is emphasised that the Federation and the LÃ¤nder \"take into account all indicators, in particular the incidence, the vaccination rate, and the number of severe courses of disease as well as the resulting burden on the health care system\" in order to adjust the Corona measures if necessary.\n\nCALL FOR VACCINATION: The public is \"urged\" to take up \"existing vaccination offers as soon as possible\". Employers are called upon to support their employees in this, for example by offering vaccination through company doctors and giving them time off for vaccination appointments.\n\nTRAVEL: Vaccinated and recovered persons still do not have to be quarantined after returning from a high-risk area. A high-risk area is defined as a region with a particularly high number of cases or where there are \"indications of a dangerous infection\", according to the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\nMASKS: Medical protective masks (OP or FFP2) are to continue to be \"mandatory\" in public transport and when shopping. This is to be reviewed every four weeks. However, Saxony had already lifted the mask requirement for shopping when the incidence was low.\n\nPARTY AND EVENTS: Restrictions, such as a limited number of participants for clubs and parties, are still possible, hygiene concepts have to be presented. In football stadiums and sporting events with more than 5000 spectators, a maximum of half of the seats in the venue or stadium are to be occupied. The maximum number of spectators is to be 25,000.\n\nWORK: The Corona Occupational Health and Safety Ordinance will be extended once again beyond 10 September. It requires companies to have hygiene plans and offer testing for workers.\n\nEXTENSION OF CORONA AID: The economic aid (Bridging Aid III Plus) and the facilitation of access for the Short-Time Worker's Allowance, which have so far run until the end of September, are to be extended.\n\nEPIDEMIC SITUATION: It is determined by the Bundestag and gives the federal government the right to directly issue regulations, for example on tests and vaccinations. Measures such as compulsory masks or contact restrictions, which the LÃ¤nder can stipulate, also refer to the determination of this situation according to the Infection Protection Act. The federal government and the states formulate cautiously and in their resolution ask the Bundestag \"to consider\" extending the epidemic situation beyond 11 September. (dpa)\n\n+++\n\nBy the end of the year, Germany wants to provide at least 30 million vaccine doses, especially for developing countries. In doing so, the Federal Republic is making an important contribution to the global fight against the pandemic. The first tranche is now being made available.\n\nAt the Global Health Summit in Rome on 21 May this year, Germany announced that it would provide at least 30 million vaccine doses, especially for developing countries, by the end of the year. Germany is distributing most of these doses through the international vaccine initiative COVAX.\n\nVaccines to be used immediately\n\nThe first tranche of Covid 19 vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson under supply contracts with the German government is now being delivered through COVAX. Afghanistan will receive 213,600 vaccine doses, Ethiopia 271,200, Sudan 357,600, Tajikistan 100,800 and Uzbekistan 355,200. These are countries that, according to the World Health Organisation and the global vaccine alliance Gavi, have a particularly high need and can also use the vaccine immediately in the vaccination campaigns. This enables the vaccine doses to be administered as quickly as possible to prevent further waves of infection.\n\nGermany is thus making an important contribution to the global fight against the pandemic, which has now claimed more than four million lives. In particular, it can also prevent the emergence of new virus variants.\n\n+++ Monday, 09 August 2021 +++\n\nThe French regions of Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur, Corsica and the French overseas territories of Guadeloupe, Martinique, RÃ©union, Saint Martin and Saint-BarthÃ©lemy will be classified as high-risk areas as of 8 August 2021.\n\nOther countries outside Europe are now also considered high-risk areas, including Morocco, Mexico and Thailand.\n\nThe Netherlands, on the other hand, with the exception of the overseas parts, will no longer be considered a high-risk area as of Sunday, 8 August.\n\nObserve new entry regulations\n\nPeople entering Germany from a high-risk area must fill out a digital entry form. Returnees who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered must also enter quarantine in Germany. This can be ended after five days at the earliest by a current negative coronary test.\n\nThis list shows which states or regions are currently classified as virus variant or high-risk areas.\n\n+++ Friday, 06.08.2021 +++\n\nThe Corona pandemic has devastating consequences for the cultural and creative industries. For artists, their very existence is at stake. In addition to the BKM's rescue and future package NEUSTART KULTUR, the Federal Government is helping with economic support amounting to billions of euros and other subsidies from which cultural workers also benefit.\n\nHere you will find further information and links to assistance offers that are also aimed at artists, creative professionals and the cultural industry:\n\nHardship assistance\n\nIn special individual cases, hardship assistance supports companies and self-employed individuals who have fallen on hard times as a result of the Corona pandemic. They are aimed specifically at companies and self-employed individuals for whom the existing Corona assistance provided by the federal government, the LÃ¤nder and the municipalities (such as the bridging assistance, the November assistance and the December assistance) is not effective. Hardship assistance is regulated by the LÃ¤nder. The respective federal state examines the individual case and decides at its own discretion who will receive hardship assistance. Further information on how to apply can be found on the hardship assistance website.\n\nShort-time allowance\n\nSince March 2020, the conditions for short-time work have been eased in such a way that all companies and employees affected by the Corona crisis receive fast and effective support. For more information, see the Information for workers page.\n\nSimplified access to basic income support\n\nFor cultural and media workers who have lost their income or economic livelihood due to the current crisis, access to basic income support benefits will be simplified.

This was decided by the Health Ministers of the LÃ¤nder together with Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn. Children and adolescents can thus be vaccinated in vaccination centres, by general practitioners for children, adolescents and family doctors and also as part of the vaccination of employees' relatives by company doctors. Appropriate medical information is required, as well as the consent of the parents or guardians, if necessary.\n\nWe have enough vaccine for childrens and adolescents\n\n\"We keep our promise: Everyone who wants to can be vaccinated in the summer. We have enough vaccine for all age groups. Even 12- to 17-year-old children and adolescents who decide to be vaccinated after being informed by a doctor can protect themselves and others with a vaccination,\" said Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn.\n\nFor the Covid-19 vaccination of children and adolescents aged 12 years and older, the vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna have so far been approved by the European Commission.\n\nWith regard to the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) recommends vaccination of children and adolescents aged 12 years and older with pre-existing conditions that indicate an increased risk of a severe course of COVID-19 disease, as well as for children and adolescents who have relatives or other contacts who are at high risk of a severe course of COVID-19, who cannot be vaccinated themselves, or who have a reasonable suspicion of insufficient protection after vaccination.
