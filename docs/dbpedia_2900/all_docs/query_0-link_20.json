        "text": "Results of the FPQ on seldom eaten foods\n\nHere, only selected results are presented in detail and results for all other food items of the FPQ was made available in a supplementary file.\n\nComplementary food\n\nAll complementary foods are mostly consumed by infants (22–68% consumers), a little by toddlers (5–29% consumers) and rarely by children (0–3% consumers) (Fig. ).\n\nEven though the cereals presented in Fig. are considered to be rarely consumed in Germany it should be noted that for all of the complementary foods more than 6% (up to 37% for rice-based complementary food as ready-to-eat or up to 18% for corn-based complementary food as ready-to-eat) of the infants consuming it least once a week. A supplementary table “Consumption frequency of complementary food, differentiated for the different kind of cereal bases” shows the detailed data. See supplementary table_1.xlsx. Most infant consumers can be found for rice-based complementary food as ready-to-eat: 41% consume it frequently (37% even once a week) and 27% consume it rarely whereas 15% of the toddlers are frequent consumers of rice-based complementary food as ready-to-eat and 14% consume it rarely. Millet- and corn- based complementary food as ready-to-eat is not consumed that frequently: 19% of the infants are frequent consumers of millet-based complementary food (and 13% are rare consumers) and only 6% of the toddlers consume it frequently whilst 7% consume it rarely. Complementary food as powder/flakes is used a little less frequently for nearly all kind of cereals asked for. Rice-based complementary powder/flakes are consumed frequently by 26% of the infants and 7% of the toddlers, millet-based complementary powder/flakes are frequently consumed by 26% of the infants and 11% of the toddlers and corn-based complementary powder/flakes are frequently consumed by 14% of the infants and by only 3% of the toddlers.\n\nThe most consumers of rice cake can be found in between the toddlers, followed by children and infants. Nevertheless, if they consume it, infants consume it more frequently. From the 58% infant consumers: 27% consume it frequently and 31% rarely. Looking at the toddlers: 22% of them consume it frequently and 45% rarely. As for the children: 12% of them consume it frequently and 49% rarely.\n\nb)\n\nDairy substitutes (soya drink, rice drink, oat drink) and other soya-based products\n\nStudy participants do not seem to consume dairy substitute drinks very frequently. The maximum are 7% of the children consuming soya-drink and 7% of the toddlers consuming oat-drink. For other soya-based products (e.g. tofu, desserts, custard, soya sauce) there are 22% of the toddlers and 18% of the children consuming them (Fig. ).\n\nOat drink seems to be the most common consumed substitute drink with more than 4% frequent consumers (mostly once a week) and 3% rare consumers for the toddlers and more than 1% frequent consumers and 5% rare consumers for the children. Soya based substitute drink follows with 5% rare consumers for the children and 3% for the toddlers and even nearly 3% frequent consumers for the children. Other soya-based products e.g. tofu on the other hand are consumed more often, at least by toddlers and children.\n\nAs the use of dairy substitutes may be influenced by socio-economic status (SES), we had a closer look on this influence for each substitute. It is visible, that children from families with higher SES consume more often soya-based substitute milk as families with lower (p < 0.00005) and middle SES (p < 0.015). We saw no significant influence by SES for consumption of rice drinks. The consumption of oat-drink was higher from children from families with middle (p < 0.048) or higher SES (p < 0.016) than by families with lower SES. For soya-based products, the range goes from 7% consumers for families with lower SES to 30% consumers for families with higher SES. It can be seen as well that the higher the parents’ education level, the higher the consumption of soya-based substitutes (lower SES to middle SES p < 0.006, middle SES to higher SES p < 0.0005).\n\nc)\n\nSpecial meat and sausage products (game, sheep/lamb, ostrich, rabbit, horse)\n\nConsumption differences due to age and migration background are presented here. Looking at the age differences first in Fig. . Infants seem no big consumers of these types of meat (from 0% for ostrich and horse to 9% for game meat). Toddlers and children seem to consume game meat more often but most of the time rarely. There are 4% toddlers and children that consume sheep/lamb meat frequently. They eat it mostly once a week and some consumers as well 2–3 times a week. For all the other meat and sausage products, there are less consumers, and it is consumed mostly less than once a month. There are around 30% of toddlers and children consuming game meat. 27% of the children and 32% of the toddlers consume lamb/sheep meat. 13% of the toddlers and 16% of the children consume rabbit meat. Whereas horse meat and ostrich meat are nearly not consumed (and therefore not displayed here).\n\nAs the migration background may influence the type of meat consumed, analyses were performed taking into account the migration background. It can be seen that only for game meat and sheep/lamb meat there is a visible difference in consumption frequency. Even though game meat is consumed most often rarely, if it is consumed, it is more often consumed by participants without migration background (31% consumers vs. 17% consumers with migration background (p < 0.0005)). Whereas for lamb/sheep meat the relation is inverse (p < 0.0005). 45% of participants with migration background consume lamb/sheep meat rarely or frequently. Only 20% of participants without migration background consume this meat. There are 6% of the participants with migration background that consume it even once a week and 1% that consume it 4–5 times a week. Ostrich, horse or rabbit meat are consumed rarely and there are no differences regarding the migration background.\n\nd)\n\nOffal\n\nOffal is known as a very seldom eaten food but often contains high levels of several contaminants and hence can be relevant for risk assessment. Results from KiESEL confirm that infants, toddlers or children seldom eat offal (Fig. ). Only liver from pork, beef or veal and poultry liver seem to be eaten. If it is eaten, then nearly always less than once a month and more often by toddlers and children. Only 2% of the infants eat pork, beef or veal liver and do this less than once a month. Some other offal from pork, beef and veal (e.g. heart, lungs and stomach) are eaten by 4% of the toddlers and 3% children but mostly less than once a month.\n\ne)\n\nFish and other marine animals\n\nIn the questionnaire, participants were asked about their consumption of 14 different fish and marine animal species. The questions with more than 10% consumers are presented in Fig. . Infants do not seem to eat the fish species asked for very often. Most likely, they eat cold smoked fish (14% consumers, mostly less than once a month). For all the other chosen fish species there are 0–3% infant consumers only. For toddlers and children most of the consumers can be found for canned tuna and shrimps/prawns. There are 39–44% consumers of canned tuna and 2–5% of them are frequent consumers (toddlers and children, respectively). For shrimps and prawns we found similar results even though toddlers seem to eat them slightly more frequently than children. However, there are a little less consumers for shrimps and prawns than for canned tuna. Toddlers and children as well seem to like cold smoked fish (37–40% consumers for toddlers and children, respectively). Even though most of them consume it less than once a month, there are around 5% toddlers who consume it once a week and 1% of the children even 2–3 times a week. Hot smoked fish, e.g. stremel salmon or smoked mackerel, follows in the list of the most popular fishes with 27–33% consumers (toddlers and children, respectively) but it is mostly consumed less than once a month. Mussels, squid and halibut show 89–17% consumers as well.\n\nf)\n\nTea and tea products\n\nTea is presented in three groups which are all presented in Fig. : 1. Three different types of fennel tea and ready-to-drink tea especially for children, 2. Other herbal teas, 3. Rooibos tea, green tea and black tea.\n\nBaby fennel tea (loose or tea bag), baby fennel tea (instant), other fennel tea and ready-to-drink tea\n\nInfants and toddlers mostly consume baby fennel tea (instant and ready-to-drink). Toddlers and children mostly consume other fennel tea. One quarter of the infants are frequent consumers of baby fennel tea (loose or tea bag). 8% of the infants drink it even nearly every day. 13% of the infants are frequent consumers of instant baby fennel tea as well. Most of them consume it 2–3 times a week but 5% of the infants consume it nearly every day. This applies to 2% of the toddlers and 1% of the children as well. Nearly 40% of the toddlers and children drink other fennel tea. For the infants there are 27% other fennel tea consumers all together and 18% of them frequent consumers (3% consume it nearly every day). 11% of the toddlers and 8% of the children are frequent consumers of other fennel tea and they consume it most often several times a week. Ready-to-drink tea especially for children is not consumed very often. There are no more than 10% consumers (toddlers) and it is mostly consumed rarely, nevertheless there are 3% of the infants who consume it nearly every day.\n\nWe wondered whether the socio-economic status of the families had an influence on the choice of fennel tea. Statistical significant differences existed only for baby fennel tea (instant). Families with middle and higher SES (7% and 4% consumers, respectively) consume it, whereas 25% of the families with lower SES consume it. Differences in consumption frequencies for fennel tea (instant) are significant between families with lower and higher SES (p < 0.0005) and between families with lower and middle SES (p < 0.0005). Most of them with lower SES drink it frequently (16%), 5% drink it nearly every day.\n\n2.\n\nHerbal teas (peppermint, camomile and melissa)\n\nInfants consume peppermint tea or melissa tea rarely. For peppermint tea there are only 2% consumers (mostly less than once a month) and for melissa tea there are 4% less frequent and 2% frequent consumers. These melissa tea numbers are similar for toddlers and children. Peppermint tea, on the other hand, is more popular with toddlers and children (22% and 40% consumers, respectively). There are even 11% of the children that consume it frequently, most of them once a week. 21% of the infants, 31% of the toddlers and 42% of the children consume camomile tea, most of them rarely. Nevertheless, there are between 8–11% who drink it frequently, the little ones mostly 2–3 times a week, the older ones mostly once a week.\n\nLooking at the social-economic influence we only see significant values in camomile tea: The most consumers of camomile tea are from families with lower SES (46% consumers) and 20% of them consume it frequently. The differences in consumption frequencies were shown between higher and middle SES to lower SES (p < 0.005 and p < 0.002, respectively).\n\n3.\n\nRooibos tea, green tea and black tea\n\nKiESEL-participants do not consume rooibos tea, green tea or black tea very often. Green tea is consumed the less, by only 3% of the toddlers and children. 3%, 7%, 13% of the infants, toddlers and children, respectively, consume black tea. It is consumed most often less than once a month or 1–3 times a month, but there are 2% of the children who drink it nearly every day. The consumption of rooibos tea is similar to the consumption of black tea. If it is consumed frequently, then mostly once a week.\n\nConcerning the socio economic background of the participants, black tea was consumed more by families with lower SES in comparison with middle SES (p < 0.002) and also in comparison with higher SES (p < 0.0005). 18% of the participants with lower SES are consumers of black tea and 6% of them consume it even frequently (1% drink it nearly every day). Whereas families with higher SES show 4% consumers and families with middle SES show 9% consumers.\n\nFor some of the tea species migration status might play a role as well. For other fennel tea (p < 0.0005) the participants without migration background show a significant higher consumption. For baby fennel tea (instant), there are no significant differences for participants with or without migration background. Peppermint tea (p < 0.022) and melissa tea (p < 0.001) were consumed more by participants without migration status. Whereas camomile tea shows higher consumption for participants with migration status (p < 0.0005). The consumption of Rooibos tea shows no significant differences between both groups. Participants with migration status also show higher percentages for consumption of green tea (p < 0.049) and black tea (p < 0.0005). Especially the percentages of frequent consumers are higher for participants with migration status (1.6% for green tea and 10.2% for black tea). For black tea, there are only around 4% consumers of the participants without migration status whereas around 24% of the participants with migration status consume black tea (3.8% of them consume black tea nearly every day).\n\nAs for regional differences (categorization of regions in KiESEL see ST11 in the supplementary file): In the north-western part exists the highest percentages of black tea consumers. This difference is significant for all regions (16%, eastern part p < 0.0015; North Rhine-Westphalia p < 0.021; Bavaria/Baden-Württemberg p < 0.038) except for the middle of Germany (11%). The participants in north-west also drink it most frequently: 5% drink it 2–3-times a week, 2% drink it nearly every day.\n\ng)\n\nDiverse foods and food groups\n\nIn these questions we asked for many different food items. We choose the following to have a closer look at. The detailed data of these diverse foods are shown in the supplementary file.\n\nSweeteners, products with stevia, calorie-reduced drinks\n\nSweeteners are only consumed by around 5% of the toddlers and children (not at all by infants) and mostly less than once a month. Only 0.4% of the infants consume food sweetened with stevia (less than once a month); 4% of the toddlers and 6% of the children consume it rarely and 2% consume it frequently (mostly once a week or 2–3 times a week). Calorie-reduced soft drinks were nearly not consumed by infants whereas around 8% of the toddlers and 21% of the children are calorie-reduced soft-drink consumers. 6% of the children consume it even frequently (around 1% nearly every day).\n\nFocused on all consumers there are no differences in the frequency of consumption of calorie-reduced soft drinks for all three socio-economic statuses. Nevertheless, it shows that the percentages of frequent consumers are higher for participants from families with lower SES (11% for families with lower SES, 4% for families with middle SES and 1% for families with higher SES). Nearly all daily calorie-reduced soft drink consumers are from families with lower SES. Participants from families with middle or higher SES consume soft drinks with sweeteners mostly less than once a month or 1–3 times a month (Table ).\n\nTable 3\n\nSocio-economic status (SES)TotalLowMiddleHighCalorie-reduced softdrinks Never83.80%85.20%83.80%84.70% < once a month1.70%6.70%12.60%7.30% 1–3 times a month3.50%3.90%1.60%3.30% Once a week3.50%2.80%0.40%2.40% 2–3 times a week2.90%0.90%0.40%1.10% 4–5 times a week0.00%0.30%0.00%0.20% 6–7 times a week4.60%0.10%0.00%0.80% No comment0.00%0.00%1.20%0.30%\n\nDifferences in frequently consumption of calorie-reduced soft drinks were significant for participants with lower SES and middle SES (p < 0.003). Due to the low number of cases, frequently consumers of calorie-reduced soft drinks with higher SES were not included in these analysis.\n\nResults for energy drink consumption surprised as 1.6% of the children (> 3 years old) already consumed it. All of them consumed it less than once a month. Two thirds of those who already consumed it are from families with lower SES.\n\n2.\n\nRocket salad and fresh spinach\n\nInfants quasi do not eat rocket salad and fresh spinach (as salad). There are only 3% rocket salad consumers and if they eat it, then most often less than once a month. Around one third of the toddlers and children eat rocket salad (mostly less than once a month). Around 3% eat it once a week. Fresh spinach is eaten even less. Only 12% of the toddlers and children consume it (mostly less than once a month).\n\n3.\n\nDark chocolate\n\nInfants rarely eat dark chocolate. Only 12% consume it and they consume it less than once a month. There are more than 50% consumers in both age groups and 7% of the toddlers and 8% of the children eat dark chocolate even frequently (mostly once a week).\n\nTables of analysis for all the other food items that are not described in this manuscript can be found in the supplementary file.\n\nFood Propensity Questionnaire\n\nThe results of the questionnaire on seldom eaten foods is intended to be used in future exposure assessment by analyzing food consumption from the dietary records in KiESEL and additionally use the information from the FPQ. A combination of these dietary assessment methods is recommended to generate high quality data [24]. Usually a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) asks for food groups with a high aggregation level instead of single food items [25]. Due to the specific food items in the KiESEL-FPQ, there are no data available to compare with. Comparable results from EsKiMo II using the same FPQ as in KiESEL have not yet been published. The previous study, VELS used a 3-days-weighing record twice [4]. The GRETA study used an estimation food record for 7 days [5]. The consumption in DONALD were recorded with a 3-days-weighing record [26]. The German Environmental Survey for Children and Adolescents (GerES V) – the environmental module of KiGGS Wave 2 asked for dietary habits in the last 4 weeks [27]. Based on this, we would like to discuss the results in the view of the importance in risk assessment of several substances.\n\nAccording to the results presented above, complementary food based on rice has the most infant consumers of all complementary foods asked for and should be carefully investigated in risk assessment of arsenic compounds and considered in risk assessments of possible contamination of complementary food as powder/flakes with mycotoxins [28, 29]. Current data from the BfR-MEAL-Study show higher content of inorganic arsenic in rice cakes/wafers than in white or brown cooked rice [30]. Therefore, also the fact that rice cakes seem to be quite popular in all age groups of the KiESEL-study is of relevance from risk assessment perspective.\n\nDairy substitute drinks like soya, rice or oat drinks do not seem to play an important role in the eating pattern of younger children. Other soya-based products e.g. tofu on the other hand seem to be slightly more often consumed as different dairy substitute drinks. It can be seen that if they are consumed than mostly by families with middle or higher socio-economic background. As most often SES goes together with education level, it could be seen that the higher the parents’ education level the more frequently these dairy substitute are consumed. Consumption of dairy substitutes might be not only a question of money but as well a question of awareness. We found more dairy substitute consumers within the families with middle and higher parents’ educational level and that they consume it more frequently. Similar results were found in literature for vegetarian diet in general [31].\n\nIt can be seen that special meats are consumed rarely and that especially ostrich and horse meat are (nearly) not consumed. For other meat, age and migration background seem to be influencing factors on the meat choice. Especially game meat and lamb/sheep meat consumption are influenced by (lacking) migration background. Extreme levels of lead have been reported in game meat, possibly due to lead from ammunition. However, infrequent consumption of game meat will not lead to health problems in the general population [32]. Infants, toddlers and children also show no big preference for offal. It is consumed extremely rare and only those of pork, beef, veal or poultry are consumed in KiESEL. The maximum permitted levels for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in livers from beef, pork, sheep and poultry have been increased in 2013. The BfR recommends that the consumption of especially sheep liver should be avoided because of the possibly resulting higher intake of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds [33]. For future consumption surveys, a particular focus should be placed on specific consumer groups who generally consume more e.g. special meat and offal.\n\nThe selection of fish species we asked for were risk orientated and not the common fish preferred as dish. Therefore, the most fish species in the FPQ known to have high concentrations of heavy metals are rarely consumed by children in KiESEL. Whether they can significantly contribute to exposure needs to be checked based on dietary protocols and concentration levels for specific substances. Exposure assessment of methylmercury in fish, seafood and mushrooms shows that children not exceeded the recommended tolerable weekly intake. These analyses based on consumption data from VELS with a marginal consumption of tuna. Nevertheless, tuna contributes 5% to methylmercury exposure caused by high levels [34]. New exposure assessment using KiESEL data and the additional information from FPQ should be considered.\n\nConsumption frequencies of tea might be interesting for several reasons. In our point of view, we were interested in each tea species to get better data for exposure assessment to pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) [12]. In children, herbal infusion and rooibos were main contributor of PA exposure [35]. In KiESEL, the consumption frequencies of all tea species are more rarely instead of a frequent consumption. Only infants drink baby fennel tea frequently (24%) as often as rarely (27%). In comparison with EsKiMo II, consumption of tea in general is not popular in older children as well. In the total quantity of non-alcoholic beverages, tea has a proportion of 4% in girls and 6% in boys (6–11 years) and 8% in girls and 4% in boys (12–17 years) [36].\n\nEFSA started in the last years a systematic re-evaluation of authorized food additives and therefore also for sweeteners [37]. Calorie-reduced soft drinks contain sweeteners for e.g. aspartame or sucralose. In KiESEL, consumption frequencies increases with the age of children (infants: 0.2%, toddlers 8%, children: 21% consumer). The percentages of consumers of calorie-reduced soft drinks are equal for all socio-economic statuses but the frequency matters. For calorie-reduced soft drinks, the percentages of frequent consumers from families with lower SES were always higher than in the other two groups. Families with lower SES seem to drink calorie-reduced soft drinks more frequently. Under the German National Reduction and Innovation Strategy for Sugar, Fats and Salt in Finished Products, it could be assumed that sugar in soft drinks could be replaced by sweeteners, so that it is of interest whether there is an increased consumption of sweeteners to monitoring the reduction but also from a food safety perspective [38]. Among boys (11%) and girls (13%) from 6–11 years in EsKiMoII-study, lemonade (with or without sweeteners) are the third most frequently consumed beverages [36].\n\nRocket salad is known for possibly containing high contents of nitrate [39]. Children do not seem to be big consumers of rocket salad. Comparing our results with those of a consumer survey asking for seldom eaten foods conducted by BfR 10 years ago, we could see that only 3% of the KiESEL participants are frequent consumers of rocket salad (and 29% additional rare consumers) whereas 12% of the adults of the former consumer survey seemed to be frequent consumers and 57% rare consumers [40]. The small percentages might also result from the fact that rocket salad is no popular food for small children because of its spicy taste.\n\nThe consumption of dark chocolate was already an issue at the BfR because of the cadmium concentration in cocoa [41]. Dark chocolate consumption is higher for children than for infants or toddlers even though there are much more seldom consumers than frequent consumers. This was similar to the findings of this previous survey for adults. Nevertheless, the consumer percentages for adults were higher than for children. It seems that children prefer milk chocolate to dark chocolate."
