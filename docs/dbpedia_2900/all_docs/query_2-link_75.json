        "text": "If a radiological emergency occurs, depending on the emergency scenario, the\n\nFederal and state authorities\n\nPlant operators\n\nDisaster management and aid organisations such as the Technische Hilfswerk (THW) and the German Red Cross (DRK)\n\nwork closely together at home and abroad. In the case of radiological emergencies with nation wide consequences for the environment, the federal government is responsible – then the Federal Radiological Situation Centre (RLZ) under the leadership of the Federal Environment Ministry (BMUV) meets as a special crisis team. Nation wide emergency scenarios include\n\nAccidents in nuclear power plants both domestical (provided they are not yet free of fuel rods) and in neighbouring or distant countries\n\nAccidents in other nuclear facilities both domestical and in neighbouring countries that are not nuclear power plants (e.g. interim or permanent storage facilities)\n\nSatellite re-entry when radioactive material is involved\n\nThis is different for local and regional radiological emergencies. Here, the federal state in which the emergency occurred is responsible. However, depending on the development of the radiological situation, the Federal Radiological Situation Centre may assume responsibilities. Local/regional emergency scenarios with typically regionally limited consequences for the environment within the federal state in which the emergency occurs include\n\nAccidents in domestic nuclear facilities\n\nTerrorist acts\n\nAccidents with radioactive sources\n\nTransport accidents\n\nWhat is the Federal Radiological Situation Centre?\n\nThe Federal Radiological Situation Centre is a special crisis team that is convened and managed only temporarily by the Federal Environment Ministry in the event of an emergency. This crisis team is not situated at a specific location. Instead, it is a network of the authorities involved and the GRS. It is thus spatially distributed across Germany.\n\nAt the Federal Radiological Situation Centre, the Federal Environment Ministry is supported in its tasks by\n\nthe Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS)\n\nthe Federal Office for the Safety of Nuclear Waste Management (BASE)\n\nthe Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit (GRS Global Research for Safety)\n\nthe Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK) (only in German)\n\nIn an emergency, all authorities involved as well as GRS rely upon their own infrastructures. The Federal Environment Ministry brings the network together technically and organisationally in the crisis team “Federal Radiological Situation Centre”.\n\nHow does the Federal Radiological Situation Centre work?\n\nThe Federal Radiological Situation Centre is operational around the clock. This is ensured through on-call services. After the Federal Radiological Situation Centre has been alerted, it works in a team structure according to roles.\n\nIn the event of a crisis, the experts of the Federal Radiological Situation Centre carry out their tasks:\n\nfrom their respective places of work\n\nin dedicated conference rooms where the crisis team meets\n\nin terminal rooms, where the experts analyse the situation and create the situation report\n\nThe virtual exchange among each other takes place via electronic communication media. The Federal Radiological Situation Centre regularly exercises cooperation with the authorities and institutions involved at the federal and state level so that the coordination performs at best level in an emergency.\n\nOperational organisations working in the field are not part of the Federal Radiological Situation Centre but rather are under the responsibility of the federal and state ministries of the interior as well as administrative districts, cities, and municipalities. There, typically special crisis teams ensure that the operations are carried out.\n\nWhat are the tasks of the Federal Radiological Situation Centre?\n\nIn the event of a nationwide radiological emergency, the Federal Environment Ministry convenes the Federal Radiological Situation Centre. The Federal Radiological Situation Centre then takes on the following tasks:\n\nLegal basis of the Federal Radiological Situation Centre\n\nSection 106 of the Radiation Protection Act (StrlSchG) of 27 June 2017 regulates the establishment of the Radiological Federal Situation Centre.\n\nMore information"
