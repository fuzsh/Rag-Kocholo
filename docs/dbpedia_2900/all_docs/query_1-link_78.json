R-1154 (Federal Reserve\n\nBoard), 03-14 (OCC), 2003-27 (OTS))\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\nThe Institute of International Bankers (the Institute) appreciates this opportunity to comment on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (the ANPR) published by the U.S. federal banking agencies relating to their proposed framework for implementing the New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II). The Institute represents internationally headquartered banking/financial institutions that conduct banking operations in the United States through branches, agencies, commercial lending company subsidiaries, Edge corporations and/or U.S. bank subsidiaries.\n\nThe Institute strongly supports the decision by the U.S. banking agencies to issue an ANPR in order to solicit public comments early in the rulemaking process. In view of the major policy issues and potential economic effects of Basel II, we commend the transparency that has characterized the agencies implementation efforts to date. Recognizing that Basel II remains a work in progress,1 we believe the ANPR is a productive step in the ongoing dialogue between the industry and bank supervisory authorities regarding Basel II.\n\nThe Institute supports the Basel Committees efforts to develop a new capital framework that facilitates a more comprehensive and risk-sensitive approach to setting minimum capital requirements and permits the allocation of capital on the basis of a banking institutions internal risk assessments. We thus broadly support the U.S. banking agencies implementation of these reforms. Our comments regarding the ANPR relate to an issue that we believe has not been sufficiently addressed either in the Basel Committees publications concerning Basel II or the ANPR: the need for clear international standards for cross-border implementation of Basel II to ensure the primacy of the home country supervisors role in supervising the capital adequacy of internationally active banking institutions under Basel II.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nOne of the core principles underlying the original Basel Capital Accord (Basel I) and informing the development of Basel II is the importance of harmonized capital adequacy standards for internationally active banking institutions. In addition, beyond the context of risk-based capital requirements, the Basel Committee has articulated international standards relating to the supervision of cross-border establishments of banking institutions, including in the Basel Concordat and the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (the Core Principles). These international standards assign primary responsibility for supervision of a banking organizations safety and soundness to the relevant home country supervisor.\n\nIn furtherance of the objectives of Basel II and the Basel Committees international standards for cross-border bank supervision, we have urged the Basel Committee to articulate in the final Basel II documentation clear standards for the cross-border implementation of Basel IInot only for banks that operate branches in multiple countries but also for banks that operate locally incorporated bank subsidiaries in multiple countries. In this regard, we have commended the Basel Committees formation of the Basel Accord Implementation Group (the AIG), which is considering cross-border implementation issues, and we support the call for cross-border coordination among banking supervisors reflected in the Basel Committees High-Level Principles for the Cross-Border Implementation of the New Accord (the High-Level Principles), published in August. At the same time, we continue to believe that the development of clearer standards in this area is crucial.\n\nIn the Institutes view, the complexity of Basel IIs advanced approaches to credit and operational risk, combined with Basel IIs reliance on supervisory discretion (both to approve a banks implementation of those approaches and to supervise capital adequacy more generally under Pillar 2), underscores the need for international standards and procedures for cross-border coordination. The more complex and discretionary the Basel capital framework becomes, the more likely supervisors are to reach differing good faith judgments regarding a particular banks implementation of the framework. This potential is illustrated clearly by the experience of many internationally active banks which use value-at-risk methodologies to calculate a market risk capital charge. It is not uncommon for home and host country supervisors to reach reasonable but conflicting determinations regarding the adequacy of a banks market risk models, back-testing results, etc. At times, these differences have been mitigated through coordination between regulators on a bilateral basis. However, given the materiality and scope of the Basel II reforms, we believe more structured guidance is required to minimize the instances of conflicting demands by home and host country supervisors. In the absence of international standards and procedures for coordination, internationally active banks potentially face the impossible task of satisfying many different bank supervisors regarding the adequacy of their implementation of Basel II capital standards.\n\nWe believe these issues become particularly acute in jurisdictions such as the United States which propose to implement Basel II only for their largest internationally active institutions. The ANPR outlines proposed criteria for defining the banking organizations that will be required to use the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (A-IRB) approach to credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to operational risk. However, the Institute believes that it is inevitable that U.S. capital standards implementing Basel II will differ from those of other countries as the Basel Committees international standards are adapted to local banking practices, laws and regulations and accounting standards. Indeed, international variation of capital adequacy standards exists today under the considerably simpler Basel I framework, and the potential for such variation under Basel II is magnified significantly by the complexity of Basel II and its reliance on supervisory discretion.\n\nIn our July 31, 2003 comment letter to the Basel Committee regarding its Third Consultative Document (see attached), we articulated certain broad principles regarding home-host country coordination that we believe should inform the Basel Committees further development of Basel II and, in turn, all countries implementation of Basel II. We do not repeat those principles here, although we believe they are particularly relevant to the U.S. banking agencies implementation of Basel II. Instead, this comment letter focuses on certain specific issues relating to the U.S. banking agencies supervision of the capital adequacy of international banks in light of historical U.S. practices and issues raised in the ANPR.\n\nII. Achieving an Appropriate Balance Between Home and Host Country Roles in the U.S. Banking Agencies Supervision of International Banks Capital Adequacy\n\nThere are two principal areas in which the Institute believes the roles of U.S. banking agencies as host country supervisors should be more clearly defined: (1) the supervision of the capital adequacy of international banks separately incorporated U.S. bank and/or thrift subsidiaries; and (2) the supervision of international banks consolidated capital adequacy, including for purposes of determining the eligibility of international banks for financial holding company (FHC) status under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLBA).\n\nA. U.S. Bank and Thrift Subsidiaries of International Banks\n\nThe ANPR suggests that U.S. bank and thrift subsidiaries of international banks would be required to comply with U.S. regulatory capital requirements applied to U.S. banks, regardless of which Basel II approach the international bank uses on a consolidated basis.2 While this requirement essentially mirrors the approach used today by the U.S. (and many non-U.S.) bank supervisors under Basel I standards, the choice of approaches available under Basel II creates additional complications for internationally active banks. This is particularly true in the United States, where, as articulated in the ANPR, only a select few institutions will be required (or permitted) to use the A-IRB approach to credit risk and the AMA for operational risk. All other U.S. institutions will continue to use Basel I-based standards. The U.S. banking agencies decision not to implement the less sophisticated Basel II approaches means that virtually all international banks with one or more U.S. bank or thrift subsidiaries will be required to manage such subsidiaries to Basel I-based standards while managing their consolidated organizations (including their U.S. subsidiaries) to home country Basel II-based standards.\n\nImposing dual capital adequacy requirements on international banks in this regard will impose burdensome implementation costs on international banks. In the Institutes view, an international bank should not be effectively penalized for adopting one of the Basel II approaches (which the Basel Committee has determined represent an improvement over current standards) on a consolidated basis because the United States has determined not to implement that approach.\n\nIn his June 2003 speech to the Institute, Vice Chairman Ferguson of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB) recognized that difficult problems will arise if a U.S. bank subsidiary of an international bank is compelled to remain on Basel I-based rules while its parent bank adopts the foundation internal ratings-based approach to credit risk. Vice Chairman Ferguson indicated that U.S. supervisors recognize the burdens this will impose on international banks and suggested that U.S. supervisors would work with U.S. subsidiaries to develop the inputs necessary to feed into the parent banks consolidated capital calculations.3\n\nWhile the Institute supports the willingness of U.S. supervisors to be flexible in this regard, and appreciates Vice Chairman Fergusons suggestions of possible transition arrangements to deal with these issues4, we would respectfully submit that flexibility and transition arrangements will not fully address the undue burdens that will be imposed on international banks. Instead, we believe an international bank should be permitted to adopt a Basel II-based approach uniformly throughout its consolidated organization, subject to host country approval of local bank subsidiaries qualifications to use those approaches. Assuming the relevant U.S. bank supervisor determines that a locally incorporated subsidiary meets the relevant criteria to use one of the less sophisticated Basel II-based approaches, the subsidiary should be permitted to use that approach regardless of whether the United States elects to adopt the approach for internationally active U.S. banking organizations.\n\nIn this regard, we would further suggest that U.S. bank supervisors adopt a flexible approach in determining whether a locally-incorporated subsidiary meets the relevant criteria to use a Basel II-based approach. In making such a determination, U.S. bank supervisors should take into account the interrelationships between the subsidiary and the global banking institution of which it is a part and accord due deference to the home country supervisors judgments relating to the consolidated banking organization.\n\nFor example, the determination of whether a locally-chartered U.S. depository institution subsidiary of an international bank is eligible to use one of the advanced approaches under Basel II should take into consideration whether the subsidiary has implemented elements of the systems and procedures utilized by the parent institution in connection with the risk management of its global operations, regardless of whether they are the same as those utilized by domestic institutions that are permitted to use the advanced approaches. If the locally-chartered subsidiary has done so, and if the parent institutions systems and procedures have been approved and are reviewed by the institutions home country supervisor (and the home country supervisor oversees the operations of the institution on a consolidated basis in accordance with international standards), then the relevant U.S. supervisor generally should accept the validity of the institutions systems and procedures as applied by the subsidiary and not require the subsidiary to implement the IRB approach in the same manner expected of domestic institutions. We believe such an approach is consistent with the High-Level Principles.\n\nB. International Banks that Operate in the United States Through Branches and Agencies\n\nIn the Institutes view, deference to determinations on capital by a banking institutions home country supervisor is especially appropriate where the institution operates in the United States through branches or agencies and does not control any locally-chartered depository institution subsidiary. As an integral part of the banking institution itself, the operations of a branch or agency are supported by the capital of the institution as a whole, which is allocated by the banks management in accordance with its global strategy. We recognize that U.S. banking supervisors, in their proper exercise of supervisory and examination powers over branches and agencies of international banks, strive to understand and evaluate the institutions risk management processes and systems as they relate to the operations of the branch in the United States. However, assessing the consolidated capital adequacy of the institution and conducting a supervisory review of the institutions management, systems and controls for allocating capital on the basis of its global risks should be matters generally within the supervisory oversight of the home country authority.\n\nC. Compliance with Capital Standards in Excess of Home Country Minimum Requirements\n\nAs a general principle, the Institute believes that the determination of whether a banking institutions capital should be greater than the minimum required under Basel II (and, if so, what that greater amount should be) is the primary responsibility of the home country supervisor. Nevertheless, we recognize that U.S. banking supervisors operate under U.S. statutory standards that require them to make such determinations with respect to international banks. The principal example of such a determination arises under the GLBA, under which an international bank with U.S. banking operations must be well-capitalized in order to qualify as an FHC and engage in expanded financial activities in the United States (such as securities underwriting, insurance underwriting and merchant banking). Under applicable FRB regulations implementing the GLBA, international banks from countries that have adopted Basel I capital standards generally must have Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 6% and 10% and must have capital that is comparable to the capital required for a U.S. banking organization under the GLBA.\n\nIn his June 2003 speech to the Institute, Vice Chairman Ferguson indicated that the Federal Reserve Board would accept whichever of the Basel II approaches an international bank adopts under home country standards for purposes of evaluating FHC well-capitalized criteria. The Institute strongly supports the approach articulated by Vice Chairman Ferguson. Nevertheless, there are lingering concerns among many international banks that their qualifications for the advanced approaches under Basel II, including the integrity of the home country approval process, home country Pillar 2 standards and home country Pillar 3 requirements and practices, will be independently reviewed in the context of evaluations of the banks compliance with FHC well-capitalized criteria. We would therefore strongly encourage the FRB to reflect in its next Basel II rulemaking release the policy articulated by Vice Chairman Ferguson in his speech to the Institute.\n\n* * *\n\nPlease contact the Institute if we can provide any further assistance."
