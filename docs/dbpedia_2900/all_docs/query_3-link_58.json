Droughts continue to affect ecosystems, communities and entire economies.\nAgriculture bears much of the impact, and in many countries it is the most\nheavily affected sector. Over the past decades, efforts have been made to\nassess drought risk at different spatial scales. Here, we present for the\nfirst time an integrated assessment of drought risk for both irrigated and\nrainfed agricultural systems at the global scale. Composite hazard indicators were calculated for irrigated and rainfed systems separately\nusing different drought indices based on historical climate conditionsÂ (1980â2016). Exposure was analyzed for irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Vulnerability was assessed through a socioecological-system (SES) perspective, using socioecological susceptibility and lack of coping-capacity indicators that were weighted by drought experts from around the world. The analysis shows that drought risk of rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems displays a heterogeneous pattern at the global level, with higher risk for southeastern Europe as well as northern and southern Africa. By providing information on the drivers and spatial patterns of drought risk in all dimensions of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, the presented analysis can support the identification of tailored measures to reduce drought risk and increase the resilience of agricultural systems.",

        "text": "Droughts exceed all other natural hazards in terms of the number of people affected and have contributed to some of the world's most severe famines (FAO, 2018; CRED and UNISDR, 2018). Drought is conceived as an exceptional and sustained lack of water caused by a deviation from normal conditions over a certain region (Tallaksen and VanÂ Lanen, 2004; VanÂ Loon et al., 2016). It can have manifold impacts on social, ecological and economic systems, for instance agricultural losses, public water shortages, reduced hydropower supply, and reduced labor or productivity. While many sectors are affected by drought, agriculture's high dependency on water means it is often the first of the most heavily affected sectors (Dilley et al., 2005; UNDRR, 2019). With nearly 1.4Â billion people (18â% of the global population) employed in agriculture, droughts threaten the livelihoods of many and hamper the achievement of the Sustainable Development GoalsÂ (SDGs) â notably SDGÂ 1Â (no poverty), SDGÂ 2Â (zero hunger), SDGÂ 3Â (good health and well-being) and SDGÂ 15 (life on land). While there is ambiguity regarding global drought trends over the past century (Sheffield et al., 2012; Trenberth et al., 2013; McCabe and Wolock, 2015), drought hazards will likely increase in many regions in the coming decades (Sheffield and Wood, 2008; Dai, 2011; Trenberth et al., 2013; Spinoni et al., 2017, 2019b; UNDRR, 2019). Identifying pathways towards more drought resilient societies therefore remains a global priority.\n\nRecent severe droughts in southeastern BrazilÂ (2014â2017), CaliforniaÂ (2011â2017), the CaribbeanÂ (2013â2016), northern ChinaÂ (2010â2011), EuropeÂ (2011, 2015, 2018), IndiaÂ (2016, 2019), the Horn of AfricaÂ (2011â2012), South AfricaÂ (2015â2016, 2018) and VietnamÂ (2016) have clearly shown that the risk of negative impacts associated with droughts is not only linked to the severity, frequency and duration of drought events but also to the degree of exposure, susceptibility and lack of coping capacity of a given socioecological system (SES). Despite this, proactive management of drought risk is still not a reality in many regions across the world. Droughts and their impacts are still mostly addressed through reactive crisis management approaches, for example, by providing relief measures (Rojas, 2018). To improve the monitoring, assessment, understanding and ultimately proactive management of drought risk effectively, we need to acknowledge that the root causes, patterns and dynamics of exposure and vulnerability need to be considered alongside climate variability in an integrated manner (Spinoni et al., 2019a; Hagenlocher et al., 2019).\n\nOver the past decades, major efforts have been made to improve natural hazard risk assessments and their methodologies across scales, ranging from global risk assessments to local-level assessments. At the global scale several studies have been published in recent years, focusing on the assessment of flood risk (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Ward et al., 2013, 2014), seismic risk (Silva et al., 2018), cyclone risk (Peduzzi et al., 2012) or multi-hazard risk (e.g.,Â Dilley et al., 2005; Peduzzi et al., 2009; Welle and Birkmann, 2015; Garschagen et al., 2016; INFORM, 2019; Koks et al., 2019; UNDRR, 2019). While major progress has been made regarding the mapping, prediction and monitoring of drought events at the global scale (e.g.,Â Yuan and Wood, 2013; Geng et al., 2013; Spinoni et al., 2013, 2019b; Damberg and AghaKouchak, 2014; Hao et al., 2014; CarrÃ£o et al., 2017), very few studies have assessed either exposure to drought hazards (GÃ¼neralp et al., 2015) or drought risk at the global level (CarrÃ£o et al., 2016; Dilley et al., 2005; Li et al., 2009). The study by CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016) presents the first attempt to map drought risk at the global scale while considering drought hazard (based on precipitation deficits), exposure (population, livestock, crops, water stress) and societal vulnerability (based on social, economic and infrastructural indicators). While generic drought risk assessments are useful for establishing an overview of the key patterns and hotspots of drought risk, it is increasingly acknowledged that drought risk assessment should be tailored to the needs of specific users so that management plans can be developed to reduce impacts (Vogt et al., 2018; UNDRR, 2019). Impact or sector-specific assessments of who (e.g.,Â farmers) and what (e.g.,Â crops) are at risk as well as what they are at risk of (e.g., abnormally low soil moisture, deficit in rainfall, below average streamflow), where they are at risk and why are needed to inform targeted drought risk reduction, resilience and adaptation strategies (IPCC, 2014). Such analyses are currently lacking. Furthermore, in their exposure analysis, CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016) do not distinguish between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, although different hazard indicators are relevant when assessing drought risk for these systems. In addition, the vulnerability analysis presented by CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016) is based on a reduced set of social, economic and infrastructure-related indicators and does not account for the role of ecosystem-related indicators as a driver of drought risk â a gap that was recently highlighted in a systematic review of existing drought risk assessments across the globe (Hagenlocher et al., 2019). A socioecological-system perspective, especially when assessing drought risk in the context of agricultural systems, where livelihoods depend on ecosystems and their services, can help to better understand the role of ecosystems and their services not only as a driver of drought risk but also as an opportunity for drought risk reduction (Kloos and Renaud, 2016).\n\nThis paper addresses some of the above gaps by presenting, for the first time, an integrated drought risk assessment that brings together data from different sources and disciplines for rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems considering relevant drought hazard indicators, exposure and vulnerability at the global scale. The spatial variability in drought risk on global and regional scales might help to identify leverage points for reducing impacts and properly anticipate, adapt and move towards resilient agricultural systems.\n\nToday, it is widely acknowledged that risk associated with natural hazards, climate variability and change is a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability (IPCC, 2014; UNDRR, 2019). Following that logic, Fig.Â 1 shows the overall workflow of the assessment, while the subsequent sections describe in detail how drought risk for agricultural systems, including both irrigated and rainfed systems, was assessed at the global scale.\n\nThe composite drought hazard indicators were calculated for irrigated and rainfed systems separately using drought indices based on historical climate conditionsÂ (1980â2016), which resulted in integrated hazard maps for both rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems, respectively. The different irrigated and non-irrigated crops by country were considered to be the exposed element. Due to the lack of high-resolution gridded data on an agricultural-dependent population at the global scale, this exposure indicator was not considered. The vulnerability component was assessed through a SES lens, where socioecological susceptibility and a lack of coping-capacity indicators were weighted by drought experts around the world.\n\n2.1âDrought hazard and exposure indicators\n\nThe drought hazard indicators considered here represent the average drought hazard during the periodÂ 1980 toÂ 2016 in each spatial unit for which it is computed. Drought hazard is defined as a deviation of the situation in a specific year or month from long-term mean conditions in the 30-year reference period fromÂ 1986 toÂ 2015. To quantify drought hazard for such a long period, we used the global water resources and water use model WaterGAP (MÃ¼llerÂ Schmied et al., 2014) and the global crop water model (GCWM; Siebert and DÃ¶ll, 2010). The models simulate terrestrial hydrologyÂ (WaterGAP) and crop water useÂ (GCWM) for daily time steps on a spatial resolution of 30âarcminÂ (WaterGAP) or 5âarcminÂ (GCWM). The most recent version, WaterGAPÂ 2.2d, was forced by the WFDEI-GPCC climate data set (Weedon et al., 2014), which was developed by applying the forcing data methodology developed in the EU project WATCH on ERA-Interim reanalysis data (TableÂ 1). The GCWM used the CRU-TSÂ 3.25 climate data set (Harris et al., 2014) as input. CRU-TSÂ 3.25 was developed by the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia by interpolation of weather station observations and is provided as a time series of monthly values. Pseudo-daily climate was generated by the GCWM as described in Siebert and DÃ¶llÂ (2010). Following the definitions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put forward in their Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2014), exposure is defined as the elements located in areas that could be adversely affected by drought hazard. The distinct exposure of irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems to drought was considered by weighting grid-cell-specific hazards with the harvested area of irrigated and rainfed crops according to the monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas'Â (MIRCA2000) data set (Portmann et al., 2010) when aggregating grid-cell-specific hazards to exposure at a national scale. MIRCA2000 was also used to inform the models used in the hazard calculations about growing areas and growing periods of irrigated and rainfed crops. The data set refers to the period centered around the yearÂ 2000; time series information is not available at the global scale. To maximize the representativeness of the land use, the reference period and evaluation period used in this study were centered around the yearÂ 2000.\n\n2.1.1âIrrigated agricultural systems\n\nThe composite drought hazard indicator is defined as the product of mean severity and frequency of drought events. For irrigated agricultureÂ (CH_IrrigAg) it combines an indicator for streamflow drought hazardÂ (SH), i.e.,Â for abnormally low streamflow in rivers, with an indicator of an abnormally high irrigation water requirementÂ (IH; Fig.Â 1). It thus considers the deviations of both demand and supply of water from normal conditions. SHÂ and IHÂ are computed with a spatial resolution of 0.5â by 0.5â (55âkm by 55âkm at the Equator). Greenland and Antarctica are excluded. As IHÂ is not meaningful in grid cells without irrigation, CH_IrrigAg is only computed for grid cells in which irrigated crops are grown according to MIRCA2000 (Portmann et al., 2010).\n\nIHÂ was calculated by using the GCWM based on a monthly time series of net irrigation requirements fromÂ 1980 toÂ 2016. The net irrigation requirement is the volume of water needed to ensure that the AET of irrigated crops is similar to their PET (Fig.Â 1). The calculations were performed for 487â121Â grid cells with a resolution of 5âarcmin, containing irrigated crop areas, and then aggregated to 26â478Â grid cells with a 30âarcmin resolution to be consistent with the resolution used by WaterGAP. SHÂ was calculated by using WaterGAP based on a monthly time series of streamflow fromÂ 1980 toÂ 2016 inÂ 66â896 grid cells with a 0.5âÃ0.5â resolution worldwide.\n\nFor bothÂ IH andÂ SH, drought hazard per grid cell was quantified as the product of the (scaled or transformed) mean severity of all drought events during the evaluation periodÂ 1980â2016 and the frequency of drought events during this period. Drought events forÂ IH andÂ SH were determined independently. In the case of IHÂ computation, a drought event starts as soon as the monthly irrigation requirement exceeds the irrigation requirement threshold and ends when the surplus reaches zero. In the case of SHÂ computation, a drought starts if the monthly streamflow drops below the streamflow threshold and ends as soon as the deficit reaches zero. For each grid cell and each of the 12Â calendar months, a drought threshold was defined as the median of the variable values in the respective calendar month during the reference periodÂ 1986â2015. To avoid spurious short droughts and drought interruptions, it was defined that a drought event starts (1)Â with at least 2Â consecutive months with an IHÂ surplus or a SHÂ deficit and (2)Â 1Â month without an IHÂ surplus or if a SHÂ deficit does not break the event (Spinoni et al., 2019a). The accumulated surplusÂ (IH) divided by the deficitÂ (SH) during each drought event is the severity of the drought event. Mean severity is computed as the arithmetic average of the severity of all drought events during the evaluation period. As in the case ofÂ SH, the deficit and thus the severity of streamflow drought are strongly correlated with the mean annual streamflow; mean severity is therefore scaled by dividing the accumulated streamflow deficit by mean annual streamflow. In this way scaled mean streamflow drought severity is expressed as the fraction of the mean annual flow volume that is on average missing during drought events. In the case ofÂ IH, mean severity is transformed logarithmically before computation ofÂ IH, as in most grid cells the volume of irrigation water needed additionally in drought periods is relatively small (volume in 569Â out of the 26â478Â irrigated grid cells is lower than 100âm3; in 1450Â grids it is lower than 1000âm3). However, there are also some grids with extremely high values (95Â grids where the additional irrigation water requirement per drought event is larger than 100â000â000âm3). The logarithmic transformation accounted for the specific value distribution.\n\nCH_IrrigAg was then calculated for each grid cell by combining SH and IH. To ensure that both indicators are weighted equally, their native values were first scaled to a range betweenÂ 0 andÂ 1 by dividingÂ SH andÂ IH in each grid cell by the maximumÂ SH orÂ IH detected globally. The frequency distribution of the SHÂ values calculated that way was shifted to the left, with a mean ofÂ 0.244, while the frequency distribution ofÂ IH was shifted to the right, with a mean ofÂ 0.664. Therefore, CH_IrrigAg was calculated for each grid cell as\n\n(1) CH _ IrrigAg = 0.5 SH / SH Â¯ + IH / IH Â¯ ,\n\nwith SHÂ being the grid-cell-specific streamflow hazard, IHÂ being the grid-cell-specific irrigation requirement hazard, and SHÂ¯ Â and IHÂ¯ Â being the mean ofÂ SH orÂ IH calculated across all grid cells.\n\nThe exposure of irrigated agricultural systems to drought at the national scale was derived as the harvested-area weighted mean of the CH_IrrigAg across all grid cells belonging to the respective aggregation units.\n\n2.1.2âRainfed agricultural systems\n\nThe composite drought hazard indicator for rainfed agricultureÂ (CH_RfAg) was quantified based on the ratio of actual crop evapotranspiration (AET in m3âdâ1) to potential crop evapotranspiration (PET in m3âdâ1), calculated for the evaluation periodÂ 1980â2016 and compared to the reference periodÂ 1986â2015 (Fig.Â 1). PET quantifies the water requirement of the crop without water limitation, while AET refers to the evapotranspiration under actual soil moisture conditions.\n\nThe GCWM was applied for 24Â specific rainfed crops and the two groups âothers, annualâ and âothers, perennialâ to calculate crop-specific AET and PET on a daily time step. Together, the 24Â crops and two crop groups cover all crop species distinguished by FAO in their database FAOSTAT. The sum of daily crop-specific AET and PET was calculated for all crops and for each year in the periodÂ 1980â2016 for 927â857Â grid cells containing rainfed cropland and aggregated to 37â265Â grid cells with the resolution 0.5âÃ0.5â.\n\nThe mean ratio between AET and PETÂ (AET/PET)Â¯ for the reference periodÂ 1986â2015 was then calculated for each grid cell. AET/PETÂ¯ reflects long-term water limitations for the geographic unit, with low values representing high aridity and high values for low aridity. CH_RfAg was then determined by calculating the ratio AETâââPET for each year fromÂ 1980â2016 and by deriving the percentile of a relative difference of 10â% to the long-term mean ratio AET/PETÂ¯ from the time series. Consequently, CH_RfAg reflects the probability of occurrence of a drought year in which the ratio between total AET and total PET across all rainfed crops is 10â% lower than the long-term mean ratio AET/PETÂ¯ . We also tested other percentage thresholds (20â%, 30â%, 50â%), but for many parts of the world we never computed reductions of the ratio AETâââPET by more than 10â% of the long-term mean ratio (TableÂ S5). Therefore, it was decided to use the 10â% threshold consistently.\n\n2.1.3âIntegration of drought exposure of irrigated and rainfed cropping systems\n\nThe combined drought exposure of rainfed and irrigated cropping systems was evaluated at the country level by averaging the harvested-area weighted drought exposure of irrigated and rainfed cropping systems. As described before, distinct methods were used to calculate hazard and exposure of irrigated and rainfed systems so that a direct comparison of the exposure values is not meaningful. In addition, the frequency distributions differed considerably, with a harvested-area weighted global mean of the drought exposure of 0.455Â for irrigated systems and 0.189Â for rainfed systems. To ensure a more similar weight of rainfed and irrigated drought exposure, country-specific exposures were divided by the global mean, and then the integrated exposure was calculated as harvested-area weighted mean:\n\n(2) Exp tot = AH rf â Exp rf / 0.189 + AH irr â Exp irr / 0.455 / AH tot ,\n\nwith Exptot, Exprf and ExpirrÂ being the exposure of the whole, rainfed and irrigated cropping systems to drought and AHtot, AHrf and AHirrÂ being the harvested area of all crops, rainfed crops and irrigated crops.\n\n2.2âVulnerability and risk assessment\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeÂ (IPCC, 2014), vulnerability is the predisposition to be adversely affected as a result of the sensitivity or susceptibility of a system and its elements to harm, coupled with a lack of coping and adaptive capacity. The assessment of drought vulnerability is complex because it depends on both biophysical and socioeconomic drivers (Naumann et al., 2014). Due to this complexity, the most common method to assess vulnerability in the context of natural hazards and climate change is using composite indicators or index-based approaches (Beccari, 2016; deÂ Sherbinin et al., 2019). Although their usefulness for policy support has also been subject to criticism (Hinkel, 2011; Beccari, 2016), it is widely acknowledged that composite indicators can identify generic leverage points for reducing impacts at the regional to global scale (DeÂ Sherbinin et al., 2017, 2019; UNDRR, 2019).\n\nFollowing the workflow to calculate composite indicators proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2008) and Hagenlocher et al.Â (2018), the methodological key steps on which the vulnerability assessment is based are (1)Â the definition of the conceptual framework, (2)Â identification of valid indicators, (3)Â data acquisition and preprocessing, (4)Â analysis and imputation of missing data, (5)Â detection and treatment of outliers, (6)Â assessment of multicollinearities, (7)Â normalization, (8)Â weighted aggregation, and (9)Â visualization.\n\nAn initial set of vulnerability indicators for agricultural systems was identified based on a recent review of existing drought risk assessments (Hagenlocher et al., 2019). In total 64Â vulnerability indicators, including social, economic and physical indicators; farming practices; and environmental, governance, and crime and conflict factors, were selected and classified by socioecological susceptibility (SOC_SUS, ENV_SUS), a lack of coping capacityÂ (COP) and a lack of adaptive capacityÂ (AC) following the risk framework of the IPCC (IPCC, 2014). Indicator weights, which express the relevance of the identified indicators to characterizing and assessing the vulnerability of agricultural systems to droughts, were identified through a global survey of relevant experts (n=78), the majority of whom have worked in academia and for governmental organizations with more than 5 years of work experience (Meza et al., 2019). In total, 46Â of the 64Â indicators were considered relevant by the experts, comprising susceptibility, coping- and adaptive-capacity indicators. However, since adaptive capacity is only relevant when assessing future risk scenarios and less relevant to current risk, indicators related to adaptive capacity and indicators that could be measured with the same data source due to the similarity in what they represent were removed. For instance agriculture (%Â of GDP) and dependency on agriculture for livelihoodÂ (%) were averaged into one income indicator, and the variables GDP per capita (PPP â purchasing-power parity) and population below the national poverty lineÂ (%) both refer to poverty and therefore were also averaged to a combined indicator. This resulted in a set of 26Â indicators as part of the vulnerability assessment (TableÂ 2).\n\nFollowing data acquisition, the data were preprocessed by transforming absolute to relative values and standardized when necessary (e.g.,Â travel time to citiesââ¤â30âmin â population, divided by the total population). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the degree of missing data. The imputation of missing values was done with data from previous years and using secondary sources following Naumann et al.Â (2014) in cases where the rÂ value lay betweenÂ â1.0 andÂ â0.9 orÂ 1.0 andÂ 0.9 using a Spearman correlation matrix and scatter diagram for visual interpretation. Following suggestions by Roth et al.Â (1999), Peng et al.Â (2006) and EndersÂ (2003), listwise and pairwise deletion thresholds were selected when >30â% of data were missing on a country level and when >20â% of data were missing on the indicator level. After the deletion, 168Â countries and 26Â indicators were considered for the final analysis. To detect potential outliers, scatter plots and box plots for each indicator were created. Potential outliers were further examined using triangulation with other sources and past years. On this basis, outliers were identified in only one indicator (i.e.,Â fertilizer consumption â kgâhaâ1 of arable land) and treated using winsorization following FieldÂ (2013). Multicollinearities were identified using a Spearman correlation matrix for the different vulnerability components (social susceptibility, environmental susceptibility and a lack of coping capacity). Following the rule proposed by Hinkle et al.Â (2003), any values higher than r>0.9 or smaller than r<-0.9 were considered very highly correlated. The correlation was considered only if it was significant at the 0.05Â level (two-tailed). Two indicators for the lack of a coping-capacity component and two from social susceptibility (e.g., healthy life expectancy at birth â years â and disability-adjusted life) showed high and significant correlations. However, no indicators were excluded on this basis due to the difference in concepts they represented and their relevance at the global level. In order to render the indicators comparable, the final selected indicators were normalized to a range from 0 to 1 using minâmax normalization (Naumann et al., 2014; CarrÃ£o et al., 2016):\n\n(3) Z i = X i - X min / X max - X min ,\n\nwhere ZiÂ is the normalized score for each indicator scoreÂ Xi. For variables with negative cardinality to the overall vulnerability the normalization was defined as\n\n(4) Z i = 1 - X i - X min / X max - X min .\n\nFinally, the normalized indicator scores were aggregated into vulnerability components (SOC_SUS, ENV_SUS, COP) using weighted arithmetic aggregation based on (using the example of SOC_SUS)\n\n(5) SOC _ SUS = â W i Z i ,\n\nwhere WiÂ is the weights for each normalized data set, and ZiÂ is the weights as obtained from the global expert survey. Therefore, weights were normalized to add up toÂ 1. The final indicators and their respective weights are listed in TableÂ 2. The vulnerability components of socioecological susceptibilityÂ (SE_SUS) were combined using an average, which was then combined with COP to obtain a final vulnerability indexÂ (VI) score:\n\n(6) VI = V ( SE _ SUS ) + V ( COP ) / 2 .\n\nThe final drought risk indexÂ (DRI; Fig.Â 1) was calculated by multiplying the indices for drought hazard and exposure by vulnerability. At the pixel level, the presence of hazard and vulnerability point to a certain drought risk, independent of how much crop area is contained in the specific pixel. At the aggregated level, the different crop areas in the specific pixels must be considered; therefore exposure was calculated as harvested-area weighted mean of the pixel-level hazard and then multiplied by vulnerability to calculate drought risk at the country level.\n\nThe total drought risk score for irrigated and rainfed systems combinedÂ (DRItot) is derived by multiplying the exposure of the whole cropping system Exptot (Eq.Â 2) by the VI.\n\n2.3âComparison against drought impact data\n\nThe outcomes of the risk assessment for irrigated and rainfed systems combinedÂ (DRItot) were compared against impact data from the international Emergency Events DatabaseÂ (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of DisastersÂ (CRED) using visual correlation (Fig.Â 6). EM-DAT systematically collects reports of drought events and drought impacts from various sources, including UNÂ agencies, NGOs, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies. Here, the number of drought events within the periodÂ 1980â2016 was used as an input for the comparison. Therefore, a drought event is registered in EM-DAT when at least one of the following criteria applies: 10Â or more people are dead, 100Â or more people are affected, or a declaration of a state of emergency or a call for international assistance is made.\n\nThe present study performs, for the first time, a separate global drought risk analysis for irrigated and rainfed cropping systems, including regions that indicate a high vulnerability to droughts and are particularly exposed. In previous assessments, the share of irrigated cropland was either ignored or considered to be a vulnerability indicator (CarrÃ£o et al., 2016). The drought hazard analysis is based on three indicators: SH, IH and CH_RfAg, which quantify drought as a deviation from normal conditions consistent with common definitions. In agreement with the results for drought hazard obtained by CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016), the largest drought hazard is obtained for arid and semi-arid regions such as northern and southern Africa, northern Mexico, along the coastline of Peru and Chile, the Arabian Peninsula, and Mongolia for rainfed systems; Italy, Turkey and western Mexico for irrigated systems; and the western USA, northeastern Brazil, western Argentina, central Asia, the Middle East, western India, northern China and southern Australia for both irrigated and rainfed systems. In contrast, previous studies based on standardized indices such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI) have detected the highest drought hazard mainly in humid regions such as central Europe, southeastern Asia, southern Brazil and tropical Africa (Geng et al., 2016). The reason for this difference could be that deviations from normal conditions should not be treated similarly for arid and humid regions, as not every precipitation or streamflow deficit in humid regions will automatically become a hazard for cropping systems. In fact, in humid regions, crops often perform better in relatively dry years (Holzkamper et al., 2015). We account for these effects by normalizing streamflow deficits with long-term mean annual river dischargeÂ (SH) or by calculating the probability of reductions in the AETâââPET ratio of rainfed crops in relative termsÂ (CH_RfAg).\n\nIn the present study, the rainfed hazard is computed as the probability of a 10â% decline in the AETâââPET ratio compared to long-term mean conditions, whereas the irrigated drought hazard represents the combination of severity and frequency values derived from the streamflow or irrigation water requirement (see Sect.Â 2). While the methodology reflects the common understanding of the factors most influential for drought hazard in the two cropping systems well, a direct numerical comparison of the calculated hazard for rainfed and irrigated systems is not meaningful. The hazards and exposure calculated in this study should be used to rank or compare countries within the rainfed or irrigated domain but not in between. The reasoning for the calculation of the total exposure and risk in this study was less to support comparisons across countries but more to account for the different extent of irrigated and rainfed systems within the specific countries. There are countries in which crop production is completely rainfed and countries in which all crops are irrigated so that only the risk for the rainfed or irrigated systems is relevant. Aside from these extremes, crop production in most countries is either predominantly irrigated or predominantly rainfed. We account for this by calculating total crop exposure to drought (Fig.Â 4d) as the harvested-area weighted mean of the exposures of irrigated crops (Fig.Â 4b) and of the rainfed crops (Fig.Â 4c). Our attempt to calculate hazard, exposure and risk for the whole crop production sector by assigning a similar weight to the hazard exposures for rainfed and irrigated systems must be viewed critically, and results should be analyzed with care. A potential way to derive specific weights for rainfed and irrigated exposure could be validating not only calculated hazard and exposure but also vulnerability and risk, with information about drought impacts separately, for both irrigated and rainfed systems. A lack of data for drought impacts distinguishing rainfed and irrigated systems was the main reason why this approach was not implemented for the current study.\n\nThe calculation of the drought hazard of irrigated cropping systems in this study is based on the two components SH and irrigation IH reflecting the water supply and water demand, respectively, of irrigated systems. Therefore we do not consider specifically in our approach the availability and use of groundwater resources for irrigation. It is well known that dynamics in streamflow are usually larger than dynamics in groundwater storage so that groundwater is used by many farmers to substitute temporary deficits in surface water supply for irrigation systems. In general, access to groundwater should therefore be considered to reduce drought hazard and vulnerability of irrigated cropping systems. Consideration of groundwater resources would, however, require dynamic quantification of groundwater storage and groundwater levels, which is challenging for global-scale analyses and not possible with the models applied in this study. In addition, more conceptual work is needed to decide which degree of temporal variability in groundwater levels constitutes a hazard and how to treat long-term depletion of groundwater resources (negative trends) in drought risk studies.\n\nThe multi-dimensional nature of vulnerability of agricultural systems is represented by a set of 26Â expert-weighted indicators. One of the major limitations of this data-driven approach is the spatial detail information for computing the model; however, at a global level it is not feasible to get a harmonized data set of all the proxy variables, but some caution must be advised when zooming in at the subnational level (Naumann et al., 2018). When interpreting the results, it is necessary to consider that some highly correlated indicators were maintained in the analysis, as they present different drivers of vulnerability and hence different entry points for vulnerability reduction. The selected indicators comprise social, economic, environmental, physical and governance-related factors contributing to socioecological susceptibility and the lack of coping capacity. In doing so, the present study goes beyond existing global drought risk assessments (CarrÃ£o et al., 2016), which are based on equal weights and do not consider relevant environmental vulnerability indicators to be a driver of drought risk. The latter, however, is relevant when assessing drought risk for agricultural systems, where factors such as land degradation and soil erosion are shown to exacerbate drought risk (Hagenlocher et al., 2019). In future assessments an alternative to the expert-based weighting of vulnerability indicators chosen here could be the use of statistical approaches (e.g.,Â principal component analysis â PCA) to identify relevant indicators. However, given the high number of experts who participated in the weighting exercise (n=78) the expert-based approach seems more suitable for identifying relevant indicators when compared to an approach that builds on statistical significance only. Further, Hagenlocher et al.Â (2013) evaluated the outcomes of PCA-based and expert-based indicator choice on a composite vulnerability index and did not find major differences.\n\nThe findings of the drought risk assessment presented here correspond to a certain degree to the findings of CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016). Although the focus of the current paper is more explicitly on agriculture, both studies present methodological similarities. In CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016) the percentage of crop land per grid cell is one factor in the exposure analysis, and the percentage of irrigated agricultural land is one of the vulnerability factors. Although CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016) include other factors such as population density, livestock density and baseline water stress in the analysis, the results give a high weight to the risk for agriculture. In both studies the regions less affected by droughts correspond to the regions with little or no exposure of agriculture and population (e.g.,Â deserts and tropical forests). This is mainly the case in Amazonia and central Africa. Also, similarities between areas of high levels of risk are evident, including southern and eastern Europe, the Eurasian steppe, northern Africa and the Middle East, northeastern Brazil, and southeastern South America.\n\nSimilarities are also found for the risk of irrigated agricultural systems. Examples are irrigated croplands in India, theÂ US and Australia. Differences in the overall patterns are due to the separation of irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture in the current study and the aggregated exposure information in CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016). In an updated version of the risk map from CarrÃ£o et al.Â (2016), using a higher-resolution population database and grid-level exposure information, as shown in Vogt et al.Â (2018, Fig.Â 7), similarities are even more evident.\n\nHowever, the present study includes a spatially explicit model of AET for the main crop types of two different agricultural systems (irrigated and rainfed agriculture) and includes a specialized vulnerability index for this sector according to expert judgment. These differences revealed the importance of focusing more clearly on distinct impacts (e.g.,Â on irrigated vs. rainfed systems) when conducting drought risk assessments, even within the same sector. For instance, irrigated agricultural systems in Latin America are highly exposed to droughts, whereas the probability of droughts occurring in rainfed agricultural systems in that region is comparably low.\n\nDespite these advancements, the presented analysis does have limitations. First, due to the lack of up-to-date land use data on irrigated vs.Â rainfed agriculture at the global scale, the exposure analysis is based on MIRCA data from the yearÂ 2000 (Portmann et al., 2010). Given that cropping systems are subject to change, this adds uncertainty to the results. Second, data used for the vulnerability analysis stem from different sources, which makes it difficult to evaluate the inherent uncertainties in the data. Third, the data are not consistently available for all countries for the same years (TableÂ 2). Fourth, the vulnerability analysis is based on nationâstate-resolution data, which do not allow for mapping spatial variability in vulnerability at the subnational level. Fifth, applying expert opinions to weight drought vulnerability indicators according to their relevance brings subjectivity to the assessment, which necessitates a strong network of relevant experts. Sixth, preventive or adaptive planning requires going beyond evaluating drivers of risk and mapping current patterns of risk. Future scenarios of drought risk, considering both changing environmental and climate conditions as well as possible future socioeconomic development pathways, are needed in order to anticipate future challenges.\n\nFuture research should address these challenges by also investigating subnational patterns in vulnerability and developing future drought risk scenarios in all dimensions of drought hazards, exposure and vulnerability. In addition, attempts to investigate changes and trends in drought risk and risk components are highly needed to better understand trajectories of drought risk in different countries and for the whole world. Further, inherent uncertainties, as well as the sensitivity of the risk assessment outcomes towards changes in the input parameters (e.g.,Â indicator choice and weighting), should be investigated and validated statistically. This gap has also been highlighted in a recent review of climate vulnerability assessments (deÂ Sherbinin et al., 2019) in general as well as in a recent review of drought risk assessments (Hagenlocher et al., 2019) in particular.\n\nThe comparison conducted in this study has shown that there are limited data available on agricultural losses and impacts caused by droughts at the global level. Furthermore, impacts are not always direct, as droughts can have cascading indirect impacts (Freire-GonzÃ¡les et al., 2017; VanÂ Lanen et al., 2017) which are difficult to assess. In addition, for countries where we find high drought risk (e.g., Mongolia, Iran, Kazakhstan and the countries in southeastern Europe), no or very few drought events are registered in EM-DAT. The reason for this mismatch could be that drought events in these countries were not registered in EM-DAT. For example, in Romania, EM-DAT reports two drought events, while according to other reports, 12 years between 1980 and 2012 were classified as drought years, with 48â% of the agricultural land affected (Lupu et al., 2010; Mateescu et al., 2013). On top of this, in Iran, EM-DAT reports one drought event while other sources recounted several droughts duringÂ 1980â2005, with the most extreme drought lasting for 4 years, fromÂ 1999 toÂ 2002 (Javanmard et al., 2017; Zoljoodi and Didevarasl, 2013). These examples suggest that it cannot be concluded from missing drought records in EM-DAT that specific countries were not affected by drought. Once improved and reliable impact data are available at the global scale, future research should also focus on the statistical validation of drought risk assessments with drought events and impact data. Ongoing efforts of countries to report their losses and impacts due to natural hazards (e.g.,Â as part of the Sendai monitoring) are considered to be a first important step towards that direction.\n\nLastly, while this study presents the first attempt to assess drought risk for agricultural systems, more work is needed to analyze drought risk for other sectors, such as public water supply, tourism, energy production and waterborne transport, among others.\n\nBeccari, B.: A Comparative Analysis of Disaster Risk, Vulnerability and Resilience Composite Indicators, Plos Currents, 8, https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.dis.453df025e34b682e9737f95, 2016.â\n\nBeck, H.
