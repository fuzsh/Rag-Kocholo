        "meta_description": "The Bundesbank, as Germany's central bank, has an inherent interest in a stable financial and monetary system. This not only provides a major foundation for sustainable economic growth but is also a precondition for the effective implementation of monetary policy. The Financial Stability Act (Finanzstabilit√§tsgesetz), which entered into force in 2013, regulates the oversight and safeguarding of financial stability in Germany, forms the legal basis for the German Financial Stability Committee (G-FSC) and gives the Bundesbank crucial tasks in this committee. Moreover, the Bundesbank performs key tasks arising from the German IMF Act as part of discharging the duties and obligations of Germany's membership of the International Monetary Fund, with monetary stability as its objective.",

        "text": "Owing to its macroprudential mandate\n\nThe Financial Stability Act provides the legal framework for the German Financial Stability Committee (G-FSC), Germany's national macroprudential body. The Federal Ministry of Finance, Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank each have three voting representatives on the G-FSC, while the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency has one non-voting advisory member.\n\nThe Bundesbank exercises key functions within the G-FSC. It analyses factors that are key to financial stability and identifies risks which could potentially impair financial stability. The Bundesbank makes proposals to the committee regarding the issuing of warnings and recommendations and evaluates their implementation by the recipients, ie the Federal Government, BaFin or another domestic public sector entity.\n\nOwing to macroprudential surveillance at the European level\n\nIn addition to its key role in macroprudential oversight at the national level, the Bundesbank is closely integrated into the corresponding European structures. For one thing, the Bundesbank President is a voting member of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is responsible for macroprudential oversight of the financial system of the entire EU. For another, the Bundesbank helps to implement financial stability measures within the euro area in the context of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The Eurosystem has appointed a Financial Stability Committee (FSC) for this purpose, on which the Bundesbank is represented. Macroprudential measures in respect of banks can not only be issued nationally, but can also be strengthened by the European Central Bank (ECB). The decision on taking such measures is the responsibility of the Governing Council of the ECB.\n\nOwing to membership of the European System of Central Banks\n\nThe Bundesbank is an integral component of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and, as such, is jointly responsible for price stability within the euro area. The central banks are very interested in properly functioning financial systems because the financial system, and banks in particular, play an important role in the monetary transmission process. The Bundesbank, by dint of its membership of the ESCB, also has an explicit mandate to contribute to financial stability without prejudice to the objective of price stability. However, the Bundesbank's co-responsibility for safeguarding financial stability also derives from its involvement in banking supervision and from its role in operating and overseeing payment systems.\n\nOwing to the German IMF Act"
