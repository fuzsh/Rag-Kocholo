        "meta_description": "Climate change is an existential threat to the planet and an emerging and increasing threat to the global financial system and economy, including our own.  At the same time, the transition to a net-zero economy represents an historic economic opportunity for companies, industries, and countries.The U.S. Department of the Treasury is committed to leveraging the full extent of its capabilities in support of the Biden Administration’s government-wide approach to addressing climate change.  Treasury is working to enable and expedite the whole-of-economy net-zero transition while promoting the resiliency of the financial system to climate-related risks.  Treasury is also actively working to ensure that the benefits of clean energy investments reach low-income or underserved communities, as well as coal and other energy communities and those that have borne the brunt of legacy pollution.Since tackling climate change requires global action, Treasury is also focused on helping the United States mobilize and provide the climate finance, policy advice, and technical assistance that can help emerging and developing countries accelerate progress on climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience.Since taking office in January 2021, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen has prioritized climate issues at the Treasury Department. She appointed the first-ever Climate Counselor and established a Climate Hub in the Office of the Secretary to help set the strategic direction of Treasury’s climate work and coordinate information sharing across the Department. She also took steps to integrate climate issues across the departmental offices, which have responsibility for day-to-day policy design and execution of Treasury’s ambitious climate-related priorities. The Climate Hub provides overarching strategic direction and coordination.  It also tracks and facilitates progress to advance Treasury’s Strategic Plan goal on Combatting the Climate Crisis; identifies opportunities for greater climate ambition; helps to represent Treasury’s climate work externally and with other agencies; and provides additional resources for priority workstreams.The Office of International Affairs leads Treasury’s international engagement, including: climate finance negotiations; climate policy at the Multilateral Development Banks and the International Monetary Fund; oversight of environmental trust funds, such as the Green Climate Fund, Climate Investment Funds, and Global Environment Facility; implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships; representation and engagement in multilateral forums such as the G7, G20 (including co-chairing its Sustainable Finance Working Group), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, Financial Stability Board, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; climate finance-related trade policy; and multilateral sustainable infrastructure initiatives. The Office of Domestic Finance leads Treasury’s climate-related work with respect to the U.S. financial system, domestic community investment programs, household finances, and engagement with the insurance sector and state and local governments. It also includes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Secretariat, which coordinates among FSOC member agencies to advance the recommendations in the FSOC’s 2021 Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk. The Office of Tax Policy leads the development of tax policy related to climate and energy security, including implementing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which is considered the largest investment in addressing climate change in U.S. history. The Office of Tax Policy is currently developing guidance to implement the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax law changes and is partnering with the IRA Program Office on broader IRA implementation efforts.The IRA Program Office partners with the Office of Tax Policy on the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, with particular focus on operational issues and stakeholder outreach related to the clean energy tax incentives. The Office of Economic Policy leads on economic analysis of climate and energy-related policies, interacts with other executive branch offices on climate and energy analysis, and supports the integration of climate in the development of the President’s budget projections. The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence works to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse by illicit actors, including by combatting nature crimes such as wildlife trafficking and illegal logging and associated trade, criminal activities associated with illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and illegal mining.The Office of Management is working to make Treasury’s facilities and operations more resilient to the effects of climate change, including extreme-weather events. It is also charged with procuring electric vehicles to reduce Treasury’s fleet emissions. REMARKS AND ANNOUNCEMENTSRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

With the Principles, Treasury is supporting the mobilization of more private sector capital to address the physical and economic impacts of climate change and to seize on the historic economic opportunity presented by the green transition. Following publication of the Principles, Treasury expects to build on its engagement with stakeholders to elevate best practices, address challenges, and support financial institutions in their efforts to execute on their commitments.July 16, 2024: READOUT: Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

The Council and its members have been working in close coordination since the report to advance these recommendations, and have made considerable progress in the areas of capacity building, disclosure, data, and risk assessment. As climate change continues and associated economic costs are expected to grow, the Council recognizes the critical importance of ensuring the resilience of the financial system.Below please find announcements on treasury.gov.

The President's May 20, 2021 Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk recognizes the important role of the insurance sector. In response to the May 2021 Executive Order, the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is advancing three climate-related priorities: (1) assessing climate-related issues or gaps in the supervision and regulation of insurers, including their potential impacts on U.S. financial stability; (2) assessing the potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in U.S. markets that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, as well as facilitating mitigation and resilience for disasters; and (3) increasing FIO’s engagement on climate-related issues and leveraging the insurance sector’s ability to help achieve climate-related goals.    March 19, 2024: READOUT: U.S. Department of the Treasury Hosts Roundtable with Insurance Industry Stakeholders on Climate-Related Risks and U.S. Insurance MarketsMarch 8, 2024: U.S. Department of the Treasury and State Insurance Regulators Launch Coordinated Effort on Homeowners Insurance Data Collection to Assess the Effects of Climate Risk on U.S. Insurance MarketsFebruary 26, 2024: READOUT: U.S. Department of the Treasury Hosts Roundtable with Consumer and Climate Groups on Climate-Related Risks and U.S. Insurance MarketsNovember 1, 2023: Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office Advances First Insurer Data Call to Assess Climate-Related Financial Risk to ConsumersJune 27, 2023: Remarks by Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Graham Steele at Event Hosted by the Brookings Institution's Assessing Insurance Regulation and Supervision of Climate-Related Financial RiskJune 27, 2023: Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office Releases Report Assessing Climate-Related Risk, Gaps in Insurance SupervisionDecember 8, 2022: Update on Climate-Related Work to Federal Advisory Committee on InsuranceOctober 18, 2022: Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office Takes Important Step to Assess Climate-related Financial Risk – Seeks Comment on Proposed Data Call February 17, 2022: Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office Continues Efforts on Climate-Related Financial Risks in the Insurance Sector, Joins the NGFS August 31, 2021: U.S. Department of the Treasury Launches New Effort on Climate-Related Financial Risks in the Insurance Sector Other Climate-Related Announcements and Remarks December 4 , 2023: Statement by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

        "text": "Climate change is an existential threat to the planet and an emerging and increasing threat to the global financial system and economy, including our own. At the same time, the transition to a net-zero economy represents an historic economic opportunity for companies, industries, and countries.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury is committed to leveraging the full extent of its capabilities in support of the Biden Administration’s government-wide approach to addressing climate change. Treasury is working to enable and expedite the whole-of-economy net-zero transition while promoting the resiliency of the financial system to climate-related risks. Treasury is also actively working to ensure that the benefits of clean energy investments reach low-income or underserved communities, as well as coal and other energy communities and those that have borne the brunt of legacy pollution.\n\nSince tackling climate change requires global action, Treasury is also focused on helping the United States mobilize and provide the climate finance, policy advice, and technical assistance that can help emerging and developing countries accelerate progress on climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience.\n\nSince taking office in January 2021, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen has prioritized climate issues at the Treasury Department. She appointed the first-ever Climate Counselor and established a Climate Hub in the Office of the Secretary to help set the strategic direction of Treasury’s climate work and coordinate information sharing across the Department. She also took steps to integrate climate issues across the departmental offices, which have responsibility for day-to-day policy design and execution of Treasury’s ambitious climate-related priorities.\n\nThe Climate Hub provides overarching strategic direction and coordination. It also tracks and facilitates progress to advance Treasury’s Strategic Plan goal on Combatting the Climate Crisis; identifies opportunities for greater climate ambition; helps to represent Treasury’s climate work externally and with other agencies; and provides additional resources for priority workstreams.\n\nThe Office of International Affairs leads Treasury’s international engagement, including: climate finance negotiations; climate policy at the Multilateral Development Banks and the International Monetary Fund; oversight of environmental trust funds, such as the Green Climate Fund, Climate Investment Funds, and Global Environment Facility; implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships; representation and engagement in multilateral forums such as the G7, G20 (including co-chairing its Sustainable Finance Working Group), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, Financial Stability Board, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; climate finance-related trade policy; and multilateral sustainable infrastructure initiatives.\n\nThe Office of Domestic Finance leads Treasury’s climate-related work with respect to the U.S. financial system, domestic community investment programs, household finances, and engagement with the insurance sector and state and local governments. It also includes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Secretariat, which coordinates among FSOC member agencies to advance the recommendations in the FSOC’s 2021 Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk.\n\nThe Office of Tax Policy leads the development of tax policy related to climate and energy security, including implementing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which is considered the largest investment in addressing climate change in U.S. history. The Office of Tax Policy is currently developing guidance to implement the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax law changes and is partnering with the IRA Program Office on broader IRA implementation efforts.\n\nThe IRA Program Office partners with the Office of Tax Policy on the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, with particular focus on operational issues and stakeholder outreach related to the clean energy tax incentives.\n\nThe Office of Economic Policy leads on economic analysis of climate and energy-related policies, interacts with other executive branch offices on climate and energy analysis, and supports the integration of climate in the development of the President’s budget projections.\n\nThe Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence works to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse by illicit actors, including by combatting nature crimes such as wildlife trafficking and illegal logging and associated trade, criminal activities associated with illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and illegal mining.\n\nThe Office of Management is working to make Treasury’s facilities and operations more resilient to the effects of climate change, including extreme-weather events. It is also charged with procuring electric vehicles to reduce Treasury’s fleet emissions.\n\nREMARKS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L.

The vast majority of the law’s climate change investment is delivered via tax incentives, putting Treasury at the forefront of this landmark legislation. Since the measure was signed into law in August 2022, Treasury has worked expeditiously to write the rules that will make real the promise of this legislation.

With the Principles, Treasury is supporting the mobilization of more private sector capital to address the physical and economic impacts of climate change and to seize on the historic economic opportunity presented by the green transition.

The Council and its members have been working in close coordination since the report to advance these recommendations, and have made considerable progress in the areas of capacity building, disclosure, data, and risk assessment. As climate change continues and associated economic costs are expected to grow, the Council recognizes the critical importance of ensuring the resilience of the financial system.\n\nBelow please find announcements on treasury.gov.
