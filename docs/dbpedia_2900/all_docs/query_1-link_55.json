        "text": "Statement:\n\nBy December 31, 2015, reduce the annual adult combustible tobacco consumption in the United States from 1,342 cigarette equivalents per capita to 1,174 cigarette equivalents per capita, which will represent an approximate 12% decrease from the 2012 baseline.\n\nDescription:\n\nSmoking and second hand smoke is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, killing more than an estimated 480,000 people in the U.S. each year. For every smoker who dies from a smoking-attributable disease, another 30 live with a serious smoking-related disease. Smoking costs the U.S. more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct medical costs, and more than $156 billion in lost productivity. An estimated 58 million nonsmoking Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes more than 41,000 deaths in non-smoking adults each year . While smoking among U.S. adults is down significantly from a decade ago, the decline in adult smoking rates has slowed, concurrent with reductions in state investments in tobacco control program. Fortunately, people who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer; it reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. .\n\nIn 2010, HHS issued Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan, outlining a set of comprehensive actions framed around four key Healthy People 2020 tobacco control objectives:\n\n1) reduce tobacco use\n\n2) reduce the initiation of tobacco use\n\n3) increase successful cessation attempts by smokers\n\n4) reduce the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.\n\nThe National Prevention Strategy, released in 2011, includes tobacco control as one of seven priorities across the U.S. Government.\n\nIn 2012, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.6 billion, more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking. There is also a growing concern regarding new tobacco products that are being marketed to smokers as alternatives for use in smoke-free environments. Dual use of cigarettes and other tobacco products can maintain tobacco addiction and use among smokers who might otherwise quit. The marketing of purported reduced-risk products may increase overall tobacco use. Consumer mistaken perceptions of the “safety” of these products may pose a continuing obstacle for tobacco control.\n\nStates continue to reduce funding for comprehensive tobacco control. Research has shown that progress to prevent initiation and promote cessation in comprehensive programs is reversed when funding is no longer sustained.\n\nHHS engages with multiple stakeholders in implementing tobacco control activities, which include: Congress, the public, minority communities, groups affected by tobacco-related health disparities, state and local tobacco control officials, tobacco control and public health non-governmental organizations, the scientific & research community, and businesses.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has provided direction and support for tobacco control activities in the following legislative actions:\n\n• The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n• The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)\n\n• The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)\n\n• The Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA)\n\nHHS oversees tobacco control and prevention committees covered by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. All meetings of these committees are open to the public and offer opportunities for stakeholder feedback.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nTo reduce the national rate of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by September 30, 2015 by demonstrating a 10% reduction in national hospital-acquired catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) from the current SIR of 1.03 to a target SIR of 0.92.\n\nDescription:\n\nAt any given time, about one in every 25 hospitalized patients has a healthcare-associated infection while over 1 million HAIs occur across the U.S. healthcare system every year. These infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with tens of thousands of lives lost each year.\n\nOf these hospital-acquired events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are among the most common. Research has shown that a significant portion of these infections can be prevented, avoiding patient morbidity and mortality from this HAI while reducing costs accrued to the healthcare system.\n\nThe HAI Agency Priority Goal is to reduce the national rate of HAI by demonstrating significant, quantitative and measurable reductions in hospital-acquired CAUTI. As such; the FY2014-15 HAI Agency Priority Goal (APG) is to reduce the national CAUTI standardized infection ratio by 10% by September 2015 over the current 2012 baseline of 1.03. Of note, this SIR baseline was changed from 1.02 to 1.03 in this goal. This reflects the fact that the CDC released preliminary final numbers for 2012 in September 2013, the time at which this goal was written. However, hospitals still had through the end of the year to report final data to NHSN. Accounting for the last three months of data submitted by some hospitals caused a slight adjustment in the final (and thus baseline) 2012 SIR from 1.02 to 1.03. We make this adjustment in the HAI.APG to reflect the finalized SIR and to maintain consistency with other HAI reports moving forward.\n\nAs we carry this portion of the goal from the FY2011-13 goal, a concerted effort between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH) will continue to be a crucial to meeting goal targets. The main US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operating divisions that constitute this workgroup will focus on applying their HAI programmatic efforts in a way that aligns strategy and metrics, provides consistent messaging to its audience, uses data to target those facilities in most need of improvement, and creates synergy to achieve CAUTI reduction outcomes.\n\nWe will continue to use combined HHS programmatic levers to contribute to the achievement of CAUTI targets. These initiatives include:\n\nQuality Improvement Organization (QIOs) Program\n\nHospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) Program\n\nDisseminating Data for Action using the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)\n\nState HAI programs\n\nPartnership for Patients (PfP)\n\nComprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) for CAUTI Ongoing coordination through HAI strategic planning, HAI Regional and National Meetings\n\nRegular review and updates to the National Action Plan to prevent HAIs: \"Roadmap to Elimination.\"\n\nAttention to several factors are necessary to assess progress toward goals in this new period. As in the previous HAI goal and consistent with a measurement strategy used by a majority of hospitals that participate in national HAI reporting initiatives, this goal will use the standardized infection ratio (SIR) as the measure, NHSN, the CDC-run infection surveillance system as the primary data source and report data points on a biannual basis. A six month lag in data will remain in order to ensure the most complete and accurate data being reported out and minimize statistically insignificant variations in the data.\n\nLessons learned from the previous goal allow us to predict potential changes in the CAUTI SIR trend in the months following January 2015 now that CMS' Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) program requires participating hospitals to report CAUTI in non-intensive care units to receive their full annual payment update. The influx of new CAUTI reporters in the middle of the previous 2011-13 HAI.APG was identified as one but not the sole, etiology behind an increase in the CAUTI SIR over the life of this goal. The differences in CAUTI SIRs in ICU and non-ICU settings along with the influx of new reporters among non-ICU locations in 2015 may impact this goal. The degree to which this could again be a factor again is unknown especially since through programmatic outreach, many hospitals already report non-ICU CAUTI data to NHSN voluntarily.\n\nWe also anticipate application of the new CAUTI definition, which went into effect January 1, 2015, to the APG data we will report in subsequent quarters. Because our baseline CAUTI SIR was calculated using the old CAUTI definition, a strategy to ensure continuity and validity of new SIR data across this goal has been established. The CDC will construct a new SIR by applying the new CAUTI definition to our current baseline SIR and data points proceeding January 1, 2015. In other words, we will translate SIR data including our baseline data prior to January 1st to SIR data that is reflective of the changes in the CAUTI definition. We will also be able to illustrate the CAUTI SIR baseline and trending data by applying the new vs the old definition in order to demonstrate the degree of difference or lack thereof resulting from this definitional change. CDC has changed the CAUTI definition in response to input from stakeholders and scientific data.The HAI Workgroup will present full details on the definition change in relation to this goal and our targeted CAUTI SIR reductions to HHS leadership in November of 2015.\n\nLastly, analysis of the CAUTI data continues to reveal marked difference in reductions between intensive care and non-intensive care units. Intensive care units have significantly higher SIRs, higher number of catheter-days, and show less reductions in these indicators of progress than in the non ICU setting. The difference in CAUTI reductions between ICUs and non-ICU settings have been highlighted in analysis of both NHSN and CUSP for CAUTI data. Given the fact that sicker patients are admitted in ICUs, retaining a urinary catheter for longer may be a rooted in practice necessity or provider belief that it is a necessity and so concentrating on behavioral and systems process change may need to be further emphasized as we work in this setting to reduce CAUTI. The 10% goal for CAUTI reduction in this APG effort represents a composite goal that reflects greater reductions in non-ICU settings and lesser reductions in ICUs. Improvements in CAUTI however, have been demonstrated in large scale improvement programs when actively engaged in embedding evidence-based infection control protocol and a culture of safety unit and facility-wide. It’s also important to note that preliminary projections through the first three quarters of 2015 continue to show a fall in the CAUTI SIR and an on-track trajectory for achieving the CAUTI goal target.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nBy December 31, 2015, decrease the rate of Salmonella Enteritidis illness in the population from 2.6 cases per 100,000 (2007-2009 baseline) to 1.9 cases per 100,000.\n\nDescription:\n\nSalmonella is the leading known cause of bacterial foodborne illness and death in the United States. Each year in the United States, Salmonella causes an estimated 1.2 million illnesses, including fever and diarrhea, and between 400 and 500 deaths. Salmonella serotype Enteritidis (SE), a subtype of Salmonella, is now the most common type of Salmonella in the United States and accounts for approximately 20% of all Salmonella cases in humans. The most significant sources of foodborne SE infections are shell eggs (FDA-regulated) and broiler chickens (USDA-regulated). Therefore, reducing SE illness from shell eggs is the most appropriate FDA strategy for reducing illness from SE. Preventing Salmonella infections depends on actions taken by regulatory agencies, the food industry and consumers to reduce contamination of food, as well as actions taken for detecting and responding to outbreaks. As part of the shared vision to reduce foodborne illness, HHS's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed a Priority Goal to reduce Salmonella contamination in shell eggs, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with FDA to gather more data to better estimate sources of illness. Additionally, USDA, FDA and CDC are involved in many interagency efforts, including the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC). This interagency collaboration is working to improve methods used to estimate the proportion of foodborne illnesses associated with specific sources.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nBy December 31, 2015, reduce the annual adult combustible tobacco consumption in the United States from 1,342 cigarette equivalents per capita to 1,174 cigarette equivalents per capita, which will represent an approximate 12% decrease from the 2012 baseline.\n\nDescription:\n\nSmoking and second hand smoke is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, killing more than an estimated 480,000 people in the U.S. each year.

For the ACF Child Care program, the goal is to increase the number of states with Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) that meet the seven high quality benchmarks for child care and other early childhood programs, developed by HHS. QRIS is a mechanism by which to improve the quality of child care available in communities and increase parents’ knowledge and understanding of the child care options available to them. In order for a QRIS to be considered as meeting high-quality benchmarks, it must 1) be statewide; 2) be eligible to child care centers and family child care homes; 3) include quality improvement indicators that cover learning environments and curriculum, teacher/practitioner standards, and family partnerships and strengthening; 4) use training or on-site consultation to help child care programs attain or maintain quality improvement standards beyond licensing; 5) offer financial incentives for maintaining or increasing quality to child care centers and family child care homes; 6) include quality assessments of child care centers and family child care homes; and 7) use symbols or simple icons that indicate levels of quality as part of resource and referral/consumer education services to parents seeking child care. For FY 2011, a baseline of 17 states had implemented a QRIS that met all outlined high quality benchmarks. The baseline was calculated using FY 2012-2013 State Plans that were submitted in September 2011. In FY 2014, 29 states had a QRIS that met high quality benchmarks, meeting the previously established target. States expanded from pilot programs to statewide-systems and increased availability to quality information, leading them to meet more components of the QRIS measure. States were also supported by targeted technical assistance through state specific benchmarks and goals. The FY 2014 results show that states continue to make progress toward implementing QRIS that meet high-quality benchmarks, and the ACF Office of Child Care (OCC) has established a target of 32 states for FY 2015.\n\nCurrently, many states meet some, but not all seven, of the outlined benchmarks. States are making significant progress toward implementing a comprehensive QRIS that meets all outlined quality benchmarks; however, their progress is masked by the single figure reported. To provide a more complete picture of QRIS implementation and improvements across the country, OCC is closely tracking the progress of states that may not meet all quality benchmarks, but that have demonstrated improvements by increasing the number of benchmarks reached. For example, as of FY 2014, at least six states have incorporated six quality benchmarks and at least six states have incorporated five quality benchmarks. Between FY 2011 and FY 2014, 27 states and territories have made progress on at least one of the components of the measure. In addition, targeted technical assistance provided by the new National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance, as well as other technical assistance partners funded by ACF, will continue to help states work toward their goal of improving their QRIS.\n\nAlso as part of this Priority Goal, the ACF Office of Head Start (OHS) is striving to increase the percentage of Head Start children in high quality classrooms. Progress is measured by reducing the proportion of Head Start grantees scoring in the low range in any domain of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS: Pre-K). This research-based tool measures teacher-child interaction on a seven-point scale in three broad domains: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. OHS successfully began data collection using random samples for the CLASS: Pre-K in the first quarter of FY 2012. Analysis of the full data set of CLASS scores for the cohort of 388 Head Start grantees that received on-site monitoring in the 2011-2012 Head Start “school year” occurred in October of 2012, and OHS established a baseline of 25 percent scoring in the low range.\n\nAn analysis of CLASS scores for the most recent cohort of 404 Head Start grantees that received on-site monitoring in the 2013-2014 Head Start “school year” (FY 2014 actual result) indicates that 23 percent of grantees scored in the low range, thus meeting the target of 27 percent. All grantees scoring in the low range (below 2.5) in FY 2014 did so for the Instructional Support domain. (Nationwide for the CLASS: Pre-K tool, scores are typically higher in the domains of Emotional Support and Classroom Organization than in the domain of Instructional Support.)\n\nThe FY 2014 result is a signicant improvement relative to the previous FY 2013 result, when the number of grantees scoring below a 2.5 was 31 percent. In response to the data from the FY 2013 CLASS reviews, OHS developed a system to provide more intentional targeted assistance to those grantees that score in the low range on CLASS. OHS is continuing to flag grantees that score in the low range, conduct more analyses on the specific dimension level, which are specific elements or skill areas within each of the three domains, and providing periodic reports to its Regional Offices so they can direct their TTA to specific grantees. For example, concept development, quality of feedback, and language modeling are the three dimensions within the domain of Instructional Support. Providing TTA at the more specific dimension-level supports grantees to focus in on the skills that need improvement.\n\nThere are some challenges to making progress in these areas. In the past two decades, a growing body of evidence has established the importance of quality child care in promoting healthy child development and school readiness and success for children. However, systemic changes take time to implement, and states are at different starting points. In the FY 2016 Budget request to Congress, the President continued to build a continuum of high-quality early childhood programs, including proposing an historic investment of $82 billion over 10 years to increase the availability of high-quality child care for children under four years old. On November 19, 2014, the President signed into the law the first statutory reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program since 1996, which aims to move children receiving subsidies into high-quality child care settings. Among a comprehensive array of reforms, the new statute includes an increased focus on improving the quality of child care through systemic quality investments, which will help move states toward meeting this priority performance goal. In addition, the statute includes provisions requiring states to evaluate the measurable outcomes of their quality improvement activities. OCC is gathering information about QRIS implementation through the CCDBG Plan and the annual quality performance report, as well as providing states with targeted technical assistance through state specific technical assistance plans and goals. ACF recently announced the Early Childhood Training and Technical Assistance System, which transforms the current TA system for child care, T/TA for Head Start, and related programs into a coordinated system that will provide training, resources and materials to multiple stakeholder groups at regional, state and local levels to support school readiness. The new National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance will help OCC continue to support the infrastructure of an early childhood education quality improvement framework, including QRIS.\n\nAdditionally, with respect to Head Start, there are 50,000 Head Start and Early Head Start classrooms across the country in diverse settings ranging from New York City to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Changing teacher behavior and practices at the ground level to improve the quality of the classroom is a formidable challenge, particularly in highly rural areas, American Indian and Alaska Native programs, and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs where finding qualified staff can be difficult due to more limited access to higher education. OHS is using multiple approaches to address this challenge, including policy levers, training and technical assistance, and professional development efforts.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nImprove the quality of early childhood programs for low-income children. By September 30, 2017, HHS will improve the quality of early childhood programs for low-income children by increasing the number of states with Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) that meet high quality benchmarks from a baseline of 17 states in FY 2011 to 37 states in FY 2017, reducing the proportion of grantees receiving a score in the low range on the basis of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) from a baseline of 25 percent (FY 2012) to 24 percent in FY 2017, and increasing the percent of teachers in Head Start and Early Head Start that have a BA or higher by 2 percentage points each year from a baseline of 52 percent (FY 2012).\n\nDescription:\n\nThis area of work has been a Priority Goal for each of the previous Priority Goal iterations. Previously the work was limited to the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) programs; HHS intends to keep the same overarching Priority Goal, with its emphasis on improving quality, but add a second Key Indicator for ACF’s Head Start program focused on increasing the percent of teachers with a BA. In addition, HHS will expand the contributing programs to include information regarding partnerships with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to demonstrate that this Priority Goal represents an overarching Departmental priority.\n\nThis Priority Goal reflects HHS’ efforts to enhance the quality of early childhood education for low-income children. All three key measures provide unique and important aspects of boosting the quality of early childhood programs and services.\n\nHead Start is the largest early learning funding stream, serving about 1 million low-income children and their families each year. The two key measures for Head Start address the quality of instructional practice in the classroom using Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) scores and workforce qualifications through BA degrees. Reducing the percent of Head Start grantees scoring in the low range on the three CLASS measures is key to our effort to improve the overall quality of instructional practice in Head Start. A key way to achieve this is ensuring that our teachers have evidence-based knowledge, skills, and practice. By emphasizing the credentials of teachers, and striving to increase the percent of Head Start and Early Head Start teachers with a BA degree, ACF is prioritizing a distinct but complementary goal in boosting the quality of Head Start programs. A challenge is the availability of resources to ensure BA teachers are paid commensurate with their qualifications.\n\nThe third key measure assesses state Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS), which is another important aspect of quality, but rather than providing information at the individual program level, this indicator gets at quality at the state systems level. QRIS is a system used by states to improve the quality of child care available in communities and increase parents’ knowledge and understanding of the child care options available to them. QRIS supports child care providers through professional development and training as well as financial incentives; help increase parental choice by improving the overall quality of early care and education across a range of settings, giving parents more high-quality child care options; and lead to more low-income children in higher quality child care settings. QRIS across the country have been heavily funded by ACF's Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and CCDF technical assistance funding, and support has played a key role in helping states to design, implement, evaluate, and improve their QRIS. By creating and investing significant resources in QRIS, states have recognized QRIS as a systemic approach for promoting quality of early childhood and afterschool programs, and it is important to track the development and implementation of QRIS across the country.\n\nIn order for a QRIS to be considered as meeting high-quality benchmarks, it must 1) be statewide; 2) be eligible to child care centers and family child care homes; 3) include quality improvement indicators that cover learning environments and curriculum, teacher/practitioner standards, and family partnerships and strengthening; 4) use training or on-site consultation to help child care programs attain or maintain quality improvement standards beyond licensing; 5) offer financial incentives for maintaining or increasing quality to child care centers and family child care homes; 6) include quality assessments of child care centers and family child care homes; and 7) use symbols or simple icons that indicate levels of quality as part of resource and referral/consumer education services to parents seeking child care. More than half the states have implemented QRIS open to child care providers across the state, and the majority of the remaining states are piloting or planning QRIS. However, not all states have a QRIS that meets high-quality benchmarks and systemic changes take time to implement.\n\nThis goal supports HHS Strategic Goal 3: Advance the Health, Safety, and Well-Being of the American People, in particular Objective A (Promote the safety, well-being, resilience, and healthy development of children and youth.) and Objective B (Promote economic and social well-being for individuals, families, and communities). The new proposed key measure from ACF’s Office of Head Start (OHS) regarding teacher credentialing supports HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4 (Ensure Efficiency, Transparency, Accountability, and Effectiveness of HHS Programs.) Objective C: Invest in the HHS workforce to help meet America’s health and human services needs. This Priority Goal also supports three ACF Strategic Goals – to “Promote economic, health, and social well-being for individuals, families, and communities;” “Promote healthy development and school readiness for children, especially those in low-income families;” and “Promote safety and well-being of children, youth, and families.”\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nImprove the timeliness of initiation into treatment for individuals with serious mental illness. By September 30, 2017, expand the availability of evidence-based early intervention services for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) funded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Community Mental Health Services Block Grant by increasing the number of states with at least one evidence-based early intervention program that provides a team-based approach to treatment including services such as case management, recovery-oriented cognitive and behavioral skills training, supported employment, supported education services, family education and support, and low doses of medications when indicated. The goal is to increase by 130 percent from a baseline of 13 states in 2015.\n\nDescription:\n\nSerious mental illnesses often first arise in adolescence or early adulthood, and delays in treatment initiation are common. As a result, people with serious mental illness (SMI) may experience multiple episodes of acute illness accompanied by accumulating disability. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that the direct and indirect financial costs of serious mental illness—including health expenditures, disability benefits, and loss of earnings—exceed $300 billion per year in the United States.\n\nIndividuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are a high-need, high-cost population. They are frequent utilizers of emergency departments and have high rates of readmission to inpatient care, especially when co-occurring substance use disorders are present. In addition, people with SMI often have co-morbid physical health conditions and shorter life expectancies than people without SMI, primarily due to co-occurring physical health conditions that too often go unaddressed.\n\nIndividuals with serious mental illness (SMI) often experience barriers to treatment, including difficulty accessing and initiating treatment. Significant delays in the identification and treatment of SMI are common; for example, research has repeatedly found that individuals with psychosis in the U.S. often do not receive appropriate treatment for that condition for one to three years. Moreover, once they do receive care, individuals with serious mental illness might not receive evidence-based care, or care that is coordinated with medical care. There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the effectiveness of early intervention using evidence-based treatments to improve outcomes for individuals with SMI, including psychotherapy and education and employment supports. The use of peer supports is another promising practice with a growing evidence base.\n\nChallenges that prevent the dissemination of these best practices in the provision of early intervention services include lack of funding, the need for technical assistance, the need to educate and engage consumers, and the need to further build the evidence base supporting the provision of early intervention services. These challenges impact the ability of states to establish and maintain early intervention programs using Community Mental Health Services Block Grant funding.\n\nThe SMI Initiative builds on activities that are currently underway in various HHS agencies; these activities are coordinated through the HHS Behavioral Health Coordinating Council (BHCC). The BHCC subcommittee on SMI is critical to the implementation of the Initiative, which is also oriented towards achievement of this Agency Priority Goal on SMI.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nBy December 31, 2017, working with federal, state, local, tribal, and industry partners, improve preventive controls in food production facilities and reduce the incidence rate (reported cases per 100,000 population per year) of Listeria monocytogenes (L.m.) infections by 8%.\n\nDescription:\n\nWith enactment of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Congress mandated a paradigm shift to prevention – to establishing a modern system of food safety protection based not on reacting to problems but on preventing them from happening in the first place. FSMA has stimulated fundamental changes in FDA’s approach with establishment of preventive controls food safety standards. Key components of our implementation strategy include providing technical guidance and assistance to the industry, reorienting food safety staff to work in new ways, and improving surveillance of the food supply chain, so we can provide consistent, high quality oversight within the more technically sophisticated FSMA framework and better detect food safety problems when they occur. While prevention is the focus, food contamination events do occur.\n\nListeria monocytogenes (L.m.) infections are one of the leading causes of death from foodborne illness in the United States, resulting in an estimated 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths each year. Outbreak investigations determine which foods are responsible for illness and can lead to important food safety improvements. For example, recent investigations identified previously unknown sources of L.m. illnesses—cantaloupe, ice cream, and caramel apples—and focused attention on preventing contamination of these products. However, finding the source of clusters of L.m. illnesses is difficult. Determining if the same strain of L.m is making people sick, meaning the illnesses likely came from the same food source, requires intensive investigation. Clusters of illnesses caused by L.m. strains with the same genetic fingerprint are often small. Figuring out what ill persons ate in common is often very difficult; especially when some are too sick for interviews or have died and the long incubation period makes it more difficult for patients to remember what and where they ate. More complete information from patient interviews, information about isolations of L.m. from food and the environment, and whole genome sequencing of strains can all help to detect outbreaks and identify their sources. When food sources and the cause of contamination are identified, food safety changes can be implemented throughout an industry and prevent future outbreaks.\n\nTracing foods to the source of contamination and determining how the contamination occurred is challenging. Ready-to-eat (RTE) foods can be contaminated if ingredients in the foods are contaminated with L.m. and are not treated to destroy viable cells of this pathogen, or if L.m. is allowed to contaminate the RTE food because of improper sanitary conditions or practices. For many RTE foods, contamination with L.m. can be avoided – e.g., through the application of current good manufacturing practices and sanitation. Sanitation controls include effective environmental monitoring programs designed to identify and eliminate L.m. in and on surfaces and areas in production and processing facility. As we learn from L.m. illness investigations and implement the preventive controls regulations, FDA will work with our food safety partners to better characterize the risks of L.m. contamination and provide guidance on how to better evaluate the hazards in food production and processing operations, and implement and monitor effective measures to prevent contamination.\n\nAs part of a shared vision to reduce foodborne L.m. illnesses, HHS’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) have undertaken several activities to realize this vision. FDA recently released new preventive controls standards and is now working to increase industry’s application of preventive controls for L.m. hazards. FDA, CDC, National Institute of Health (NIH), and USDA-FSIS are collaborating to use genomic methods to help determine the food source of outbreaks and to determine the sources of L.m. in the food supply chain. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), combined with robust data from epidemiologic investigations, has the potential to greatly improve the detection and investigation of L.m. outbreaks and can even help link single, sporadic illnesses to foods, something rarely possible before. FDA and USDA-FSIS share regulatory responsibility for preventing L.m. contamination in food and as such will jointly report on their array of activities to reduce L.m. contamination at various points across the food supply chain. Collectively, these activities should help to reduce the overall burden of listeriosis in the population.\n\nFindings from these efforts will ultimately advance the work of the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration, a tri-agency group of FDA, CDC, and USDA-FSIS, that is combining data from outbreaks with other information to determine the major sources of L.m. illness. The results of this work will significantly contribute to FDA’s and USDA-FSIS’s efforts in implementing more risk-informed food safety strategies and to better target resource allocations.\n\nThis Agency Priority Goal supports HHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective E to reduce the occurrence of infectious disease and the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce the incidence of L.m. infections. It also supports FDA Strategic Priorities, Goal 1, Enhance Oversight of FDA-Regulated Products and all the corresponding Objectives. Improving food safety is one of the CDC Director’s designated “Winnable Battles.” The indicator to strengthen collection of patient interview and laboratory data is consistent with a Quarterly Progress Report target for the CDC Director. And while FSIS does not fall under HHS, it is important to mention that this HHS Agency Priority Goal aligns with an outcome under USDA’s Strategic Goal 4 - to reduce the total number of Salmonella, L.m. and E.coli illnesses from USDA-FSIS regulated products and to FSIS’s Strategic Goal of preventing foodborne illness and protecting the public’s health.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nBy December 31, 2015, reduce the annual adult combustible tobacco consumption in the United States from 1,342 cigarette equivalents per capita to 1,174 cigarette equivalents per capita, which will represent an approximate 12% decrease from the 2012 baseline.\n\nDescription:\n\nSmoking and second hand smoke is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, killing more than an estimated 480,000 people in the U.S. each year. For every smoker who dies from a smoking-attributable disease, another 30 live with a serious smoking-related disease. Smoking costs the U.S. more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct medical costs, and more than $156 billion in lost productivity. An estimated 58 million nonsmoking Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes more than 41,000 deaths in non-smoking adults each year . While smoking among U.S. adults is down significantly from a decade ago, the decline in adult smoking rates has slowed, concurrent with reductions in state investments in tobacco control program. Fortunately, people who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer; it reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. .\n\nIn 2010, HHS issued Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan, outlining a set of comprehensive actions framed around four key Healthy People 2020 tobacco control objectives:\n\n1) reduce tobacco use\n\n2) reduce the initiation of tobacco use\n\n3) increase successful cessation attempts by smokers\n\n4) reduce the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.\n\nThe National Prevention Strategy, released in 2011, includes tobacco control as one of seven priorities across the U.S. Government.\n\nIn 2012, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.6 billion, more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking. There is also a growing concern regarding new tobacco products that are being marketed to smokers as alternatives for use in smoke-free environments. Dual use of cigarettes and other tobacco products can maintain tobacco addiction and use among smokers who might otherwise quit. The marketing of purported reduced-risk products may increase overall tobacco use. Consumer mistaken perceptions of the “safety” of these products may pose a continuing obstacle for tobacco control.\n\nStates continue to reduce funding for comprehensive tobacco control. Research has shown that progress to prevent initiation and promote cessation in comprehensive programs is reversed when funding is no longer sustained.\n\nHHS engages with multiple stakeholders in implementing tobacco control activities, which include: Congress, the public, minority communities, groups affected by tobacco-related health disparities, state and local tobacco control officials, tobacco control and public health non-governmental organizations, the scientific & research community, and businesses.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has provided direction and support for tobacco control activities in the following legislative actions:\n\n• The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n• The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)\n\n• The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)\n\n• The Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA)\n\nHHS oversees tobacco control and prevention committees covered by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. All meetings of these committees are open to the public and offer opportunities for stakeholder feedback.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nTo reduce the national rate of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by September 30, 2015 by demonstrating a 10% reduction in national hospital-acquired catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) from the current SIR of 1.03 to a target SIR of 0.92.\n\nDescription:\n\nAt any given time, about one in every 25 hospitalized patients has a healthcare-associated infection while over 1 million HAIs occur across the U.S. healthcare system every year. These infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with tens of thousands of lives lost each year.\n\nOf these hospital-acquired events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are among the most common. Research has shown that a significant portion of these infections can be prevented, avoiding patient morbidity and mortality from this HAI while reducing costs accrued to the healthcare system.\n\nThe HAI Agency Priority Goal is to reduce the national rate of HAI by demonstrating significant, quantitative and measurable reductions in hospital-acquired CAUTI. As such; the FY2014-15 HAI Agency Priority Goal (APG) is to reduce the national CAUTI standardized infection ratio by 10% by September 2015 over the current 2012 baseline of 1.03. Of note, this SIR baseline was changed from 1.02 to 1.03 in this goal. This reflects the fact that the CDC released preliminary final numbers for 2012 in September 2013, the time at which this goal was written. However, hospitals still had through the end of the year to report final data to NHSN. Accounting for the last three months of data submitted by some hospitals caused a slight adjustment in the final (and thus baseline) 2012 SIR from 1.02 to 1.03. We make this adjustment in the HAI.APG to reflect the finalized SIR and to maintain consistency with other HAI reports moving forward.\n\nAs we carry this portion of the goal from the FY2011-13 goal, a concerted effort between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH) will continue to be a crucial to meeting goal targets. The main US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operating divisions that constitute this workgroup will focus on applying their HAI programmatic efforts in a way that aligns strategy and metrics, provides consistent messaging to its audience, uses data to target those facilities in most need of improvement, and creates synergy to achieve CAUTI reduction outcomes.\n\nWe will continue to use combined HHS programmatic levers to contribute to the achievement of CAUTI targets. These initiatives include:\n\nQuality Improvement Organization (QIOs) Program\n\nHospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) Program\n\nDisseminating Data for Action using the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)\n\nState HAI programs\n\nPartnership for Patients (PfP)\n\nComprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) for CAUTI Ongoing coordination through HAI strategic planning, HAI Regional and National Meetings\n\nRegular review and updates to the National Action Plan to prevent HAIs: \"Roadmap to Elimination.\"\n\nAttention to several factors are necessary to assess progress toward goals in this new period. As in the previous HAI goal and consistent with a measurement strategy used by a majority of hospitals that participate in national HAI reporting initiatives, this goal will use the standardized infection ratio (SIR) as the measure, NHSN, the CDC-run infection surveillance system as the primary data source and report data points on a biannual basis. A six month lag in data will remain in order to ensure the most complete and accurate data being reported out and minimize statistically insignificant variations in the data.\n\nLessons learned from the previous goal allow us to predict potential changes in the CAUTI SIR trend in the months following January 2015 now that CMS' Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) program requires participating hospitals to report CAUTI in non-intensive care units to receive their full annual payment update. The influx of new CAUTI reporters in the middle of the previous 2011-13 HAI.APG was identified as one but not the sole, etiology behind an increase in the CAUTI SIR over the life of this goal. The differences in CAUTI SIRs in ICU and non-ICU settings along with the influx of new reporters among non-ICU locations in 2015 may impact this goal. The degree to which this could again be a factor again is unknown especially since through programmatic outreach, many hospitals already report non-ICU CAUTI data to NHSN voluntarily.\n\nWe also anticipate application of the new CAUTI definition, which went into effect January 1, 2015, to the APG data we will report in subsequent quarters. Because our baseline CAUTI SIR was calculated using the old CAUTI definition, a strategy to ensure continuity and validity of new SIR data across this goal has been established. The CDC will construct a new SIR by applying the new CAUTI definition to our current baseline SIR and data points proceeding January 1, 2015. In other words, we will translate SIR data including our baseline data prior to January 1st to SIR data that is reflective of the changes in the CAUTI definition. We will also be able to illustrate the CAUTI SIR baseline and trending data by applying the new vs the old definition in order to demonstrate the degree of difference or lack thereof resulting from this definitional change. CDC has changed the CAUTI definition in response to input from stakeholders and scientific data.The HAI Workgroup will present full details on the definition change in relation to this goal and our targeted CAUTI SIR reductions to HHS leadership in November of 2015.\n\nLastly, analysis of the CAUTI data continues to reveal marked difference in reductions between intensive care and non-intensive care units. Intensive care units have significantly higher SIRs, higher number of catheter-days, and show less reductions in these indicators of progress than in the non ICU setting. The difference in CAUTI reductions between ICUs and non-ICU settings have been highlighted in analysis of both NHSN and CUSP for CAUTI data. Given the fact that sicker patients are admitted in ICUs, retaining a urinary catheter for longer may be a rooted in practice necessity or provider belief that it is a necessity and so concentrating on behavioral and systems process change may need to be further emphasized as we work in this setting to reduce CAUTI. The 10% goal for CAUTI reduction in this APG effort represents a composite goal that reflects greater reductions in non-ICU settings and lesser reductions in ICUs. Improvements in CAUTI however, have been demonstrated in large scale improvement programs when actively engaged in embedding evidence-based infection control protocol and a culture of safety unit and facility-wide. It’s also important to note that preliminary projections through the first three quarters of 2015 continue to show a fall in the CAUTI SIR and an on-track trajectory for achieving the CAUTI goal target.\n\nLearn More\n\nStatement:\n\nBy September 30, 2015, improve the quality of early childhood programs for low-income children through implementation of the Quality Rating and Improvement Systems in the Child Care and Development Fund, and through implementation of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System in Head Start.\n\nDescription:\n\nThis Priority Goal calls for actions in FY 2014 and FY 2015 to improve the quality of early childhood education programs for low-income children. For the ACF Child Care program, the goal is to increase the number of states with Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) that meet the seven high quality benchmarks for child care and other early childhood programs, developed by HHS. QRIS is a mechanism by which to improve the quality of child care available in communities and increase parents’ knowledge and understanding of the child care options available to them. In order for a QRIS to be considered as meeting high-quality benchmarks, it must 1) be statewide; 2) be eligible to child care centers and family child care homes; 3) include quality improvement indicators that cover learning environments and curriculum, teacher/practitioner standards, and family partnerships and strengthening; 4) use training or on-site consultation to help child care programs attain or maintain quality improvement standards beyond licensing; 5) offer financial incentives for maintaining or increasing quality to child care centers and family child care homes; 6) include quality assessments of child care centers and family child care homes; and 7) use symbols or simple icons that indicate levels of quality as part of resource and referral/consumer education services to parents seeking child care. For FY 2011, a baseline of 17 states had implemented a QRIS that met all outlined high quality benchmarks. The baseline was calculated using FY 2012-2013 State Plans that were submitted in September 2011. In FY 2014, 29 states had a QRIS that met high quality benchmarks, meeting the previously established target. States expanded from pilot programs to statewide-systems and increased availability to quality information, leading them to meet more components of the QRIS measure. States were also supported by targeted technical assistance through state specific benchmarks and goals. The FY 2014 results show that states continue to make progress toward implementing QRIS that meet high-quality benchmarks, and the ACF Office of Child Care (OCC) has established a target of 32 states for FY 2015.\n\nCurrently, many states meet some, but not all seven, of the outlined benchmarks. States are making significant progress toward implementing a comprehensive QRIS that meets all outlined quality benchmarks; however, their progress is masked by the single figure reported. To provide a more complete picture of QRIS implementation and improvements across the country, OCC is closely tracking the progress of states that may not meet all quality benchmarks, but that have demonstrated improvements by increasing the number of benchmarks reached. For example, as of FY 2014, at least six states have incorporated six quality benchmarks and at least six states have incorporated five quality benchmarks. Between FY 2011 and FY 2014, 27 states and territories have made progress on at least one of the components of the measure. In addition, targeted technical assistance provided by the new National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance, as well as other technical assistance partners funded by ACF, will continue to help states work toward their goal of improving their QRIS.\n\nAlso as part of this Priority Goal, the ACF Office of Head Start (OHS) is striving to increase the percentage of Head Start children in high quality classrooms. Progress is measured by reducing the proportion of Head Start grantees scoring in the low range in any domain of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS: Pre-K). This research-based tool measures teacher-child interaction on a seven-point scale in three broad domains: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. OHS successfully began data collection using random samples for the CLASS: Pre-K in the first quarter of FY 2012. Analysis of the full data set of CLASS scores for the cohort of 388 Head Start grantees that received on-site monitoring in the 2011-2012 Head Start “school year” occurred in October of 2012, and OHS established a baseline of 25 percent scoring in the low range.\n\nAn analysis of CLASS scores for the most recent cohort of 404 Head Start grantees that received on-site monitoring in the 2013-2014 Head Start “school year” (FY 2014 actual result) indicates that 23 percent of grantees scored in the low range, thus meeting the target of 27 percent. All grantees scoring in the low range (below 2.5) in FY 2014 did so for the Instructional Support domain. (Nationwide for the CLASS: Pre-K tool, scores are typically higher in the domains of Emotional Support and Classroom Organization than in the domain of Instructional Support.)\n\nThe FY 2014 result is a signicant improvement relative to the previous FY 2013 result, when the number of grantees scoring below a 2.5 was 31 percent. In response to the data from the FY 2013 CLASS reviews, OHS developed a system to provide more intentional targeted assistance to those grantees that score in the low range on CLASS. OHS is continuing to flag grantees that score in the low range, conduct more analyses on the specific dimension level, which are specific elements or skill areas within each of the three domains, and providing periodic reports to its Regional Offices so they can direct their TTA to specific grantees. For example, concept development, quality of feedback, and language modeling are the three dimensions within the domain of Instructional Support. Providing TTA at the more specific dimension-level supports grantees to focus in on the skills that need improvement.\n\nThere are some challenges to making progress in these areas. In the past two decades, a growing body of evidence has established the importance of quality child care in promoting healthy child development and school readiness and success for children. However, systemic changes take time to implement, and states are at different starting points. In the FY 2016 Budget request to Congress, the President continued to build a continuum of high-quality early childhood programs, including proposing an historic investment of $82 billion over 10 years to increase the availability of high-quality child care for children under four years old. On November 19, 2014, the President signed into the law the first statutory reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program since 1996, which aims to move children receiving subsidies into high-quality child care settings. Among a comprehensive array of reforms, the new statute includes an increased focus on improving the quality of child care through systemic quality investments, which will help move states toward meeting this priority performance goal. In addition, the statute includes provisions requiring states to evaluate the measurable outcomes of their quality improvement activities. OCC is gathering information about QRIS implementation through the CCDBG Plan and the annual quality performance report, as well as providing states with targeted technical assistance through state specific technical assistance plans and goals. ACF recently announced the Early Childhood Training and Technical Assistance System, which transforms the current TA system for child care, T/TA for Head Start, and related programs into a coordinated system that will provide training, resources and materials to multiple stakeholder groups at regional, state and local levels to support school readiness. The new National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance will help OCC continue to support the infrastructure of an early childhood education quality improvement framework, including QRIS.\n\nAdditionally, with respect to Head Start, there are 50,000 Head Start and Early Head Start classrooms across the country in diverse settings ranging from New York City to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Changing teacher behavior and practices at the ground level to improve the quality of the classroom is a formidable challenge, particularly in highly rural areas, American Indian and Alaska Native programs, and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs where finding qualified staff can be difficult due to more limited access to higher education. OHS is using multiple approaches to address this challenge, including policy levers, training and technical assistance, and professional development efforts.\n\nLearn More"
