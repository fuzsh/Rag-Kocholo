It is a companion document to the Canadian Biosafety Standard (CBS), 2nd Edition, 2015 in which the physical containment, operational practice, and performance and verification testing requirements are set out to ensure the safe handling and storing of human and terrestrial animal pathogens and toxins. Activities in Canada involving human and animal pathogens and toxins are regulated by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in accordance with the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act, Human Pathogens and Toxins Regulations, Health of Animals Act, and Health of Animals Regulations.\n\nThe second edition of the CBH updates the guidelines originally published as Part II of the Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines (CBSG), 1st Edition, 2013. The CBSG was developed as the result of a joint initiative undertaken by the PHAC and the CFIA to update and harmonize the following three Canadian biosafety standards and guidelines for the design, construction, and operation of facilities in which pathogens or toxins are handled or stored:\n\nHuman pathogens and toxins: Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines, 3rd Edition, 2004 (PHAC)\n\nTerrestrial animal pathogens: Containment Standards for Veterinary Facilities, 1st Edition, 1996 (CFIA)\n\nPrions: Containment Standards for Laboratories, Animal Facilities and Post Mortem Rooms Handling Prion Disease Agents, 1st Edition, 2005 (CFIA)\n\nThe CBH provides the core information and guidance on how to achieve the biosafety and biosecurity requirements specified in the CBS.

Introduction\n\nThe words in bold type are defined in the comprehensive glossary found in Chapter 24.\n\n1.1 Scope\n\nIn Canada, all facilities that are handling and storing human pathogens or toxins, such as public health laboratories, teaching and research laboratories, diagnostic laboratories in hospitals, and vaccine production plants, are regulated under the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act (HPTA) and Human Pathogens and Toxins Regulations (HPTR).Footnote 1Footnote 2 Canadian facilities that import animal pathogens, infected animals, animal products or by-products (e.g., tissue, serum), or other substances that may carry an animal pathogen or toxin or parts thereof are regulated under the Health of Animals Act (HAA) and Health of Animals Regulations (HAR).Footnote 3Footnote 4 The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for the regulation of human pathogens and toxins under the authority of the HPTA and the HPTR. The PHAC and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) are jointly responsible for the importation and transfer of animal pathogens and toxins under the HAA and HAR.\n\nThe Canadian Biosafety Handbook (CBH), 2nd Edition, 2016 is intended as a companion document to the Canadian Biosafety Standard (CBS), 2nd Edition, 2015.Footnote 5 It is a guidance document for Canadian facilities where human and terrestrial animal pathogens are handled, that updates the guidelines originally published as Part II of the Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines (CBSG), 1st Edition, 2013.Footnote 6 The CBH provides overall guidance on how to achieve the physical containment requirements, operational practice requirements, and performance and verification testing requirements for regulated facilities specified in the CBS. The CBH includes concepts that are fundamental to the development and maintenance of a comprehensive, risk-based biosafety management program; however, it does not provide specific guidance or standard operating procedures (SOPs) for individual pathogens.\n\n1.2 Overview\n\nBiosafety involves the consistent application of safety measures to minimize or prevent harm to laboratory personnel, building occupants, the public at large, the animal population, and the environment resulting from exposure to the infectious material, infected animals, or toxins handled in a containment zone. A biosafety program includes institutional plans and policies that facilitate the safe handling and storing of infectious material and toxins, and prevent the release of infectious material or toxins from the containment zone. Core elements of a biosafety program include a comprehensive training program, medical surveillance program, emergency response plan (ERP), SOPs that follow safe work practices, and a biosecurity plan. A functional and practical biosafety program encompasses all the components that are relevant to the individual laboratory work area, large scale production area, or animal work area. Some facilities may include a single laboratory that performs limited activities involving infectious material or toxins, while other programs may encompass multiple facilities on a campus performing diverse activities involving infectious material and toxins. Common safety measures in a biosafety program encompass good microbiological laboratory practices, appropriate primary containment equipment, and proper physical design of the containment zone. Increased public awareness has focused additional attention on the prevention of the misuse of pathogens and toxins, which has resulted in the fast-paced development of biosecurity, in its own right, and emphasized the value and integration of biosecurity into every biosafety program.\n\nRisk assessments are the basis of all components of a biosafety program; they are critical for identifying the hazards associated with specific tasks or activities involving infectious material and toxins and for implementing the appropriate mitigation strategies. The development of a functional biosafety program requires an overarching risk assessment of all the work to be done with infectious material and toxins. In addition, local risk assessments (LRAs) specific to the work area are conducted to identify hazards based on the infectious material or toxin in use and the activities being performed. Risk assessments describing the hazardous properties of well-characterized human pathogens and toxins and recommendations for their safe handling have been developed into technical documents known as Pathogen Safety Data Sheets (PSDSs) that are readily available on the PHAC website (www.publichealth.gc.ca/pathogens). Fact Sheets for federally reportable diseases affecting terrestrial animals in Canada have also been developed and are readily available on the CFIA website (www.inspection.gc.ca/english/sci/bio/bioe.shtml).\n\nA biosafety program can be integrated into an existing safety program or a national or international quality assurance program to improve and streamline overall safety, and promote understanding of, and compliance with, the facility’s biosafety program. There are many resources and useful documents to facilitate the development and implementation of a biosafety program. In addition to the PSDSs and Fact Sheets described above, the PHAC and the CFIA provide numerous resources, such as biosafety training materials, templates, toolkits, posters, instructional videos, and more, available through an e-learning portal (www.publichealth.gc.ca/training). Throughout the CBH, there are references to additional complementary documents and resources which can be drawn on to develop the best possible programs to prevent the release of pathogens and toxins, and the exposure of personnel.\n\n1.3 The Canadian Biosafety Standard\n\nThe CBS 2nd Edition, 2015 is a harmonized national standard for the handling and storing of human and terrestrial animal pathogens and toxins in Canada. The CBS specifies the physical containment, operational practice, and performance and verification testing requirements for the safe handling and storing of human and terrestrial animal pathogens and toxins. The CBS is used by the PHAC and the CFIA to verify the ongoing compliance of facilities regulated under the HPTA, HPTR, HAA, and HAR.\n\n1.4 How to Use the Canadian Biosafety Handbook\n\nThe information provided in the CBH is intended as guidance on how to achieve the biosafety requirements specified in the CBS, and should not be interpreted as requirements. Where the guidance relates to a requirement from the CBS, the requirement matrix or matrices are referenced (e.g., CBS Matrix 4.1), and the wording used implies an obligation (e.g., must be done, to be done). Likewise, where the guidance relates to a requirement from the legislation (i.e., HPTA, HPTR, HAA, HAR), the specific section and subsection(s), where applicable, will be referenced (e.g., HPTA 33). In some cases, measures that are required only in high containment zones are indicated as “best practices” in lower containment zones and the wording implies a recommendation (e.g., should be done).\n\nThe CBH includes a detailed list of all abbreviations and acronyms used throughout; this list is located at the beginning of the document. Each abbreviation or acronym is spelled out upon first use in each chapter, with the abbreviation immediately following in brackets; the abbreviation is used exclusively throughout the remainder of the chapter.\n\nThe CBH contains a comprehensive glossary of definitions for technical terms, located in Chapter 24 of the document; words defined in the glossary appear in bold type upon first use in each chapter. Chapter 25 provides a list of the resources that were used to develop the CBH. In-text citations are listed in the references at the end of each chapter.\n\nA full list of the external standards and other documents that are referenced in the CBH chapters is provided in Chapter 25.\n\nReferences\n\nHuman Pathogens and Toxins Act (S.C. 2009, c. 24).

Pathogens are a subset of biological material that is capable of causing disease in humans or animals. Examples of human pathogens can be found in Schedules 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act (HPTA).Footnote 1 Examples of animal pathogens can be found on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA's) website. In the context of the Canadian Biosafety Handbook (CBH), the term \"infectious material\" is used throughout to collectively refer to pure cultures or isolates of pathogens as well as any material that may contain a pathogen (e.g., infected tissue sample) or part of one that retains its pathogenicity. A microbial toxin that is isolated from its parental organism or synthetically produced is not infectious by nature; therefore, toxins are not included in the term \"infectious material\". This chapter provides a brief overview of the basic characteristics of the various types of biological material that are important in the context of the CBH.Footnote 2Footnote 3Footnote 4Footnote 5\n\n2.1 Bacteria\n\nBacteria are single-celled prokaryotic organisms lacking a nucleus and other membrane-enclosed organelles.Footnote 2Footnote 3 Morphologically 0.5-5.0 µm in size, bacteria are spherical (cocci) or appear as rods (bacilli) that may be straight, curved, spiralled, or tightly coiled. Based on Gram-stain and morphology, thousands of bacterial species have been classified into one of the following three phenotypes: Gram-negative, Gram-positive, or mycoplasma (bacteria lacking a cell wall). The cell walls in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria differ considerably. In Gram-negative organisms, the cell wall is composed of a plasma membrane, a peptidoglycan layer that comprises approximately 10% of the cell wall, and an outer membrane made of lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. In contrast, the cell wall of Gram-positive organisms is composed of a plasma membrane and a peptidoglycan layer that comprises up to 90% of the cell wall, but no lipid outer membrane. Bacteria also vary in their requirements for oxygen, being described broadly as either aerobic, microaerophilic, or anaerobic.\n\nSome bacteria can induce an immune response (e.g., inflammation) in a host organism, secrete exotoxins, produce surface-associated endotoxins, or form spores that enhance survival and transmission outside of the host for extended periods of time. Bacteria that can infect and cause disease in humans or animals are referred to as pathogenic bacteria. Some bacteria are opportunistic pathogens that can colonize the body of a human or animal host and may not cause disease unless a disruption occurs in the host's immune system or natural barriers to infection (i.e., immunocompromised or immunosuppressed), or if the host is exposed to a high dose of the pathogen. In comparison, obligate pathogenic bacteria cannot survive outside of a host and must cause disease in order to survive and be transmitted from one host to another.Footnote 6 Examples of pathogenic bacteria include Bacillus anthracis, certain strains of Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Salmonella species (spp.).\n\n2.2 Viruses\n\nViruses are the smallest of replicating organisms.Footnote 2Footnote 3Footnote 5 Their small size (20-300 nm) allows them to pass through filters that typically capture the smallest bacteria. Viruses have no metabolism of their own and redirect existing host machinery and metabolic functions to replicate. Structurally, the simplest viruses consist of nucleic acids enclosed in a protein capsid (nucleocapsid). Enveloped viruses have a more complex structure in which the nucleocapsid is enclosed inside a lipid bilayer membrane; this membrane facilitates the virus's interaction with the host cell.\n\nViruses are classified by their replication strategy and by the organization of their genome (i.e., double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], single-stranded DNA, reverse transcribing, double-stranded ribonucleic acid [RNA], negative-sense single-stranded RNA, positive-sense single-stranded RNA, and subviral agents). There are many virus families that are able to infect human or animal hosts. Some are species-specific while others infect a wide range of host species. Some viruses are able to produce a persistent infection (i.e., host cell remains alive and continues to produce virus particles over a long period of time) or a latent infection (i.e., there is a delay of months or years between infection and the appearance of disease symptoms), or they may alter the host genome by integrating (e.g., integration of a retrovirus into the host genome). Examples of pathogenic viruses include influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes virus, rabies virus, and Ebola virus.\n\n2.3 Fungi\n\nFungi are eukaryotic microorganisms that can be easily distinguished from bacteria and other prokaryotes by their greater size and the presence of organelles; including a nucleus, vacuoles, and mitochondria.23 Yeast normally grow as single cells, whereas moulds grow in branching chains. Of the 1.5 million estimated fungal species, over 500 are known to cause disease in human or animal hosts, including several species of yeast and moulds.Footnote 7\n\nExposure to fungal spores can occur via the airborne route, inoculation, or close contact, depending on the species. In addition, some fungal species may produce and disperse mycotoxins (toxins are further described in Section 2.7). In general, human and animal tissues, including blood, are not considered a risk for the airborne dispersal of fungal spores. Most species of fungi are opportunistic pathogens and will generally only cause disease in immunocompromised individuals. Examples of pathogenic fungi include Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Histoplasma capsulatum.\n\n2.4 Parasites\n\nProtozoa and helminths are parasites that live on or within a larger host organism at the host's expense.8 Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic microorganisms that lack a cell wall and are generally motile. Helminths are eukaryotic worms that may grow large enough to be visible to the naked eye. Parasites that live within the tissues or cells of their host are known as endoparasites and cause infections that are generally treatable. Some endoparasites can persist for many years in the human body, even following treatment, and will re-surface to cause disease if the host becomes immunocompromised. Ectoparasites live on the external surface, or within the skin of their host, causing an infestation. The type and degree of injury inflicted on the host will vary based on the number of parasites present.\n\nWhile most helminths in the adult stage of their life-cycle may be quite large and easily visible to the naked eye, they are generally only infectious during life-cycle phases in which they are very small (e.g., egg, larval stage). Since helminths in their infectious stage can be transmitted by ingestion, direct contact, injection, and inhalation, they present a risk similar to that of other microorganisms for accidental or unintentional exposure. Examples of pathogenic protozoa include Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania donovani, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Examples of pathogenic helminths include Trichinella spiralis (nematode), Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm), and Hymenolepis nana (tapeworm).\n\n2.5 Prions\n\nPrions are small, proteinaceous infectious particles that are generally accepted to be the cause of a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).Footnote 2Footnote 3Footnote 4 When an infectious prion enters a host, it induces the normally folded prion protein to convert to the disease-associated, misfolded prion isoform. The pathogenic isoform acts as a template that guides the misfolding of more prion proteins, eventually leading to the accumulation of large amounts of the extremely stable, misfolded proteins in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death.\n\nPrion proteins are extremely heat stable, able to bind with high affinity to metal surfaces, and can persist for long periods in the natural environment.Footnote 9 The most likely route of transmission to personnel handling infectious prions is through accidental inoculation or ingestion of infected tissues. TSEs are unique due to the long incubation times (up to 30 years) before disease symptoms appear.Footnote 10 Examples of TSEs in animals include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie, and chronic wasting disease (CWD). Examples of TSEs in humans include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru. Some prions are zoonotic pathogens, such as the BSE prions.\n\n2.6 Zoonotic Pathogens\n\nThe term \"zoonoses\" describes diseases that are transmissible between animals and humans; it encompasses both anthropozoonoses (i.e., diseases transmitted from animals to humans), and zooanthroponoses or \"reverse zoonoses\" (i.e., diseases transmitted from humans to animals).Footnote 8Footnote 11Footnote 12Footnote 13 There have been several documented laboratory acquired infections (LAIs) involving zoonotic pathogens transmitted to humans by an animal infected with or carrying a zoonotic pathogen. The risk of zoonosis exists in activities involving animals experimentally infected with a zoonotic pathogen, as well as in activities involving first generation wild-caught animals that may be infected with or carrying a pathogen indigenous to the animal's natural environment. For example, Macacine herpesvirus 1 (formerly known as herpes B virus or cercopithecine herpes virus 1) is an enzootic virus present in up to 70% of captive macaques, including rhesus macaques and cynomolgus monkeys, and has been associated with at least 50 documented LAIs.Footnote 14Footnote 15 Documented zoonoses in humans have been caused by bacteria (e.g., Salmonella spp. can cause salmonellosis; Yersinia pestis can cause plague), viruses (e.g., rabies virus can cause rabies), parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii can cause toxoplasmosis), and prions (e.g., BSE agent can cause vCJD).Footnote 16\n\n2.7 Toxins\n\nMicrobial toxins are poisonous substances that are a natural product of the metabolic activities of certain microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi).Footnote 2Footnote 3 Toxins can cause adverse health effects, known as intoxication, which can include asymptomatic or symptomatic physiological changes, severe incapacitation, or death in a human or animal resulting from an exposure (i.e., ingestion, inhalation, inoculation, or absorption) to a toxin. Severe health effects may even occur in response to relatively low dose exposures of toxins. Toxins do not replicate and are not transmitted from person to person. The most likely route of transmission to personnel handling toxins is through accidental inoculation or by the exposure of mucous membranes to aerosolized toxins. Some toxins can be artificially produced by chemical synthesis or by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology (rDNA technology is further described in Section 2.8.1). Microbial toxins are classified according to the organism from which the toxin is derived (e.g., bacterial, fungal). Microbial intoxication is typically associated with bacteria.\n\nTwo types of microbial toxins exist: exotoxins and endotoxins. Exotoxins are often heat-labile proteins and polypeptides that are produced and secreted by a variety of species, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Bacterial exotoxins can exert their toxic effects on the host through the following five mechanisms: damage to cell membranes, inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of neurotransmitter release, activation of secondary messenger pathways, or activation of host immune responses. Examples of exotoxins include tetanus toxin, produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium tetani, and cholera toxin, produced by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Additionally, a family of heat-stable exotoxins exists, called enterotoxins, which exert their primary effects on the digestive tract. Some examples include Staphylococcus Enterotoxin Type B produced by Staphylococcus aureus, heat-stable enterotoxins produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus. Endotoxins are structural molecules (i.e., lipopolysaccharides or lipooligosaccharides) that are embedded in the outer membrane of the cell wall of certain Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae. Endotoxins are relatively heat-stable and generally less toxic than exotoxins.\n\nA subset of microbial toxins is regulated by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the CFIA under the HPTA, Human Pathogens and Toxins Regulations (HPTR), Health of Animals Act (HAA), and Health of Animals Regulations (HAR); an exhaustive list of regulated toxins affecting humans can be found in Schedules 1 and 5 of the HPTA.Footnote 17Footnote 18Footnote 19\n\n2.8 Biotechnology\n\nBiotechnology describes the application of science and engineering to the direct or indirect use of living organisms or parts or products of living organisms in their natural or modified forms. Different methods can be used to alter the genetic material of an organism in order to create a different or novel organism. In nature, spontaneous mutation, crossbreeding, and natural selection lead to organisms and hybrids with new or advantageous traits or characteristics. Molecular methods, such as bacterial conjugation, transformation, and transduction, have been conventionally applied to introduce new genetic information into host organisms or cells for a variety of scientific or industrial purposes. Advancements in biotechnology have resulted in newer, more efficient techniques to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs) by the insertion, deletion, replacement, or alteration of genes or gene segments. There are many applications that employ biotechnology, including the production of antibiotics, hormones, enzymes, and antibodies. Modern biotechnology methods that are commonly used to create new or altered organisms are described below.\n\n2.8.1 Recombinant DNA\n\nGenetic material, either natural or synthetic, can be combined to construct novel rDNA. rDNA technologies, are widely used in modern-day research and industry and have many applications; including the production of transgenic animals, the cloning of microbial toxin genes, drug resistance genes, or other genes in expression vectors, as well as the production of full-length infectious viral clones.\n\nWhile there are numerous beneficial uses for rDNA technology, there is also the risk that this technology can be used to create new pathogenic organisms or to increase the pathogenicity of existing organisms, whether intentionally or not.\n\n2.8.2 Genetically Modified Organisms\n\nGMOs are organisms (i.e., plants, animals, or microorganisms) that are created through the alteration of genetic materials in a way that does not occur naturally through mating or natural recombination. The best known method for creating GMOs is through the application of rDNA technologies. A GMO can be as simple as a point-mutated bacteria strain (e.g., E. coli DH5-Alpha) or rDNA cloned into a viral host (e.g., vaccinia virus vaccines) to overexpress a specific gene for further study.Footnote 20Footnote 21 More complex GMOs include transgenic and knock-out animals (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency mice) whose genome has been altered by the insertion, removal, or alteration of DNA segments.Footnote 22\n\n2.8.3 Viral Vectors\n\nViral vectors are vehicles used to deliver genetic material into host cells for subsequent gene expression. These systems have been used for both research and gene therapy applications. Viral vector systems used for recombinant gene transfer are usually based on viruses present in the human population such as adenoviruses, herpesviruses, and retroviruses. Genetic modifications are typically made to these vectors to improve gene delivery efficiency and to enhance their safety.\n\nRetroviral vector systems, including lentiviral vectors derived from HIV-1, are competent gene transfer vehicles that are widely used for their stable integration into the chromosomes of non-dividing and dividing cells, and for their long-term transgene expression.\n\n2.8.4 Synthetic Organisms\n\nSynthetic biology is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of research that combines biology and engineering for the design, redesign, or fabrication of novel or existing natural biological components and systems.Footnote 23 Synthetic biology includes, but is not limited to, the use of synthetic DNA (sDNA) to design and construct new biological parts, devices, or systems. Synthetic biology demonstrates how rapid advances in life sciences are opening up potentially dramatic applications in fields such as health care, agriculture, industrial chemistry, and energy production.Footnote 24 It is expected to offer many significant and transforming products such as new and improved vaccines, medicines, diagnostic and infection surveillance tools, feed stocks, cleaner biofuels, and industrial processes.\n\nSimilar to rDNA technologies, synthetic biology also has the risk that this type of research may lead to the creation of new pathogenic organisms or increase the pathogenicity of existing organisms, whether intentionally or not.\n\n2.9 Cell Lines and Cell Cultures\n\nCell lines and cell cultures are commonly used in diagnostic, research, and industrial laboratories. The PHAC and the CFIA do not regulate cell lines, but do regulate the pathogens or parts thereof that might be contained within them. Many cell lines do not inherently pose a risk to the individuals manipulating them in the laboratory; however, they have the potential to contain pathogenic organisms such as bacteria (e.g., mycoplasmas), fungi, viruses, or prions. This can occur either naturally through contamination by adventitious organisms (e.g., mycoplasma and moulds), or experimentally (e.g., transduction, transfection, or infection). Cell lines available from commercial sources are generally very well-characterized and the presence of infectious contaminants is documented. Some commercially available and established cell lines and cell cultures may contain parts of human or animal pathogens as a result of a previous infection (e.g., a latent virus or presence of a helper virus) or as the result of genetic engineering to include a pathogen's genetic information that retains pathogenicity. Such cell lines or cultures may be subject to regulation by the PHAC or the CFIA, or both. Freshly prepared cell lines from a primary culture may have a higher risk of contamination, especially if the cell line was obtained from a source known to be or suspected of being infected with a pathogen. There have been documented LAIs associated with the manipulation of primary cell cultures.Footnote 25Footnote 26\n\nBacterial and fungal contamination in cell lines can be readily identified; however, viruses are not as easily identified and can pose a significant hazard. Growth conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, medium supplements) may cause altered expression of oncogenes, expression of latent viruses, interactions between recombinant genomic segments, or altered expression of cell surface proteins. The presence of biologically active mycoplasma products, the stability of mycoplasma antigens, and the fact that a number of mycoplasmas are zoonotic pathogens may make them an additional hazard to consider when working with cell lines.\n\nReferences\n\nChapter 3 - Containment Levels and Containment Zones\n\nContainment (or \"biocontainment\") refers to the combination of physical design parameters and operational practices that protects personnel, the immediate work environment, the community, and the external environment from exposure to potentially hazardous biological material. The Canadian Biosafety Standard (CBS), 2nd Edition, describes the different containment levels for facilities handling or storing human or terrestrial animal pathogens and toxins regulated by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), or both agenciesFootnote 1. The specific physical containment requirements and operational practice requirements for each containment level are specified in the CBS Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. This chapter describes the different containment levels, the different types of work areas that may be found in a containment zone, and guidance to assist regulated parties in identifying and accessing containment zones within their own facilities. Note that all diagrams presented in this chapter are for illustrative purposes only and are not to scale; the optimal configuration of containment zones and sizes of rooms and doorways will vary according to facility type and program.\n\n3.1 Containment Levels\n\nContainment level describes the minimum physical containment and operational practices that a containment zone (i.e., an identified physical area that meets the requirements for a specified containment level) requires for the safe handling of infectious material or toxins. There are four containment levels ranging from a basic laboratory for work with biological material (containment level 1 [CL1]) to the highly sophisticated facilities for work with the highest risk pathogens (containment level 4 [CL4]). The CBS specifies the minimum specific physical containment requirements and operational practice requirements for containment level 2 (CL2), containment level 3 (CL3), and CL4 facilities that are regulated by the PHAC or the CFIA and that are authorized to handle or store human and animal pathogens or toxins. Due to the low risk to public health and the animal population from Risk Group 1 (RG1) biological material, there are no physical containment requirements or operational practice requirements for CL1 facilities.\n\n3.1.1 Containment Level Categories\n\nThe following definitions provide a basic description of the different containment levels for activities with human or animal pathogens or toxins. The requirements and details specific to CL2, CL3, and CL4 can be found in the CBS.\n\n3.1.1.1 Containment Level 1\n\nWork with RG1 biological material can be safely performed in a basic laboratory work area, large scale production area, or animal work area, often described as CL1. CL1 incorporates features that provide the foundation for biosafety upon which the requirements for all higher level containment zones are built. Biosafety is primarily achieved through the use of good microbiological laboratory practices in addition to basic physical containment design elements, such as handwashing sinks, that serve to protect personnel and the environment from the biological material being handled.\n\nDue to the low risk to public health and the animal population associated with RG1 biological material, there are no specific physical and operational requirements for CL1. The general recommendations for the safe handling of RG1 biological material are described in Chapter 21.\n\n3.1.1.2 Containment Level 2\n\nCL2 builds upon the basic laboratory foundation established for CL1. Biosafety and biosecurity at CL2 are achieved through operational practices and a core subset of physical containment requirements that are proportional to the risks associated with the pathogens and toxins handled therein. Operational practices for CL2 include administrative controls (e.g., biosafety program management, training) and procedures (e.g., work practices, personal protective equipment [PPE] use, and decontamination) that mitigate the risks associated with the activities conducted within the zone. Physical containment features include facility design (e.g., location of laboratory, surface finishes, access control) and provision of biosafety equipment, such as primary containment devices (e.g., biological safety cabinets [BSCs]) for certain activities.\n\nA representative diagram of two CL2 zones is provided in Figure 3-1. A CL2 laboratory work area and a separate CL2 small animal containment zone (SA zone) are identified in this diagram; the solid red lines around the CL2 zones illustrate the containment zone perimeter (discussed in Section 3.3.1). This diagram depicts some basic physical features for CL2 zones, such as doors to separate public areas from the containment zones, primary containment devices (e.g., BSCs) located away from high traffic areas/doors, and sinks provided to facilitate handwashing upon exit from the containment zone.\n\n3.1.1.3 Containment Level 3\n\nBiosafety and biosecurity at CL3 are achieved through comprehensive operational practices and physical containment requirements. CL3 requires stringent facility design and engineering controls (e.g., inward directional airflow [IDA], high efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filtration of exhaust air), as well as specialized biosafety equipment (e.g., BSCs, centrifuges with sealed rotors) to minimize the release of infectious material into the surrounding rooms inside or outside the containment zone, or the environment outside. Additional engineering controls, such as effluent decontamination systems, may be needed in some cases (e.g., Risk Group 3 [RG3] non-indigenous animal pathogens) to control the risks associated with pathogen release into the environment. Operational practices at CL3 build upon those required for CL2, taking into consideration the increased risks associated with the pathogen(s) and laboratory activities being carried out with RG3 pathogens.\n\nA representative diagram of a CL3 SA zone is provided in Figure 3-1. The solid red line surrounding the CL3 zone illustrates the containment zone perimeter of the CL3 zone in this example. This diagram depicts some basic physical features such as a door to separate public areas from the containment zone, primary containment devices (e.g., BSCs) located away from high traffic areas/doors, a handwashing sink provided (located in the \"dirty\" change area in this example), as well as anterooms/clothing change areas equipped with a walk-through body shower for personnel, primary containment caging, and pass -through chambers (optional).\n\n3.1.1.4 Containment Level 4\n\nCL4 is the highest level of containment available. CL4 requires a highly complex facility design that is a self-contained area within a building or, when necessary, a separate building. It includes enhanced engineering controls (e.g., HEPA filtration of exhaust and supply air), specialized biosafety equipment (e.g., BSC, effluent decontamination systems), and redundant biosafety features (e.g., two stages of HEPA filtration of exhaust air). CL4 requires the maximum level of operational practices (e.g., PPE use, work practices, medical surveillance) that build upon those required at CL3. CL4 zones necessitate the use of positive-pressure suits for personnel or, as an alternative, the use of a Class III BSC line in a laboratory work area that meets the necessary CL4 requirements.\n\nA representative diagram of a CL4 zone where positive-pressure suits are worn (including a laboratory work area, an animal room, an animal cubicle and post mortem room [PM room]) is provided in Figure 3-2. Features include anterooms with showers separating \"clean\" and \"dirty\" change areas, BSCs, and double-door autoclaves.\n\n3.2 Containment Zones\n\nA containment zone refers to a physical area that meets the requirements for a specified containment level. This can be a single room (e.g., a laboratory) or a series of co-located rooms (e.g., several non-adjoining but lockable CL2 laboratory work areas), or it can be comprised of several adjoining rooms of the same containment level (e.g., CL3 suite comprised of dedicated laboratory work areas and separate animal rooms or animal cubicles). Dedicated support areas, such as anterooms (including showers and \"clean\" and \"dirty\" change areas, where required) are considered to be part of the containment zone, even though the \"clean\" change area is outside the containment barrier (see Section 3.3.2). A containment zone may include one or more work areas of different types (i.e., laboratory work area, large scale production area, animal work areas), as long as they are of the same containment level. The requirements for containment zones in facilities regulated by the PHAC and the CFIA are specified in the CBS.\n\n3.2.1 Containment Zone Work Areas\n\nThe following different types of work areas describe, in general terms, where infectious material or toxins may be handled inside a containment zone. Each area is a designated area within the containment zone.\n\n3.2.1.1 Laboratory Work Area\n\nA laboratory work area is designed and equipped for performing in vitro activities, such as scientific research, diagnostic activities, commercial activities, or teaching, with infectious material or toxins. Samples of infectious material or toxins are handled for in vitro purposes only at volumes considered to be \"laboratory scale\" (i.e., generally less than 10 litres). Virus propagation in eggs can be conducted in a laboratory work area.\n\n3.2.1.2 Large Scale Production Area\n\nA large scale production area is designed specifically for the production (i.e., manufacture) of large scale volumes of infectious material or toxins for commercial activities, scientific research, or teaching purposes. Activities involving volumes of toxins or the in vitro culture of pathogens on a scale of 10 litres or greater are generally considered as large scale. A vaccine production facility is an example of a large scale production area. Large scale work is further described in Chapter 14.\n\n3.2.1.3 Animal Work Area\n\nAn animal work area is designed specifically for in vivo activities with infectious material or toxins (i.e., activities involving whole living animals) for scientific research, diagnostic activities, teaching, or commercial purposes. Animal work areas include spaces specifically designed to house and handle living animals, and may also have designated areas to handle and store animal carcasses, such as a PM room. Animal containment zones describe containment zones that include multiple animal work areas (i.e., a containment zone that includes one or more animal rooms or animal cubicles). Animal containment zones are further described in Section 3.2.2.\n\n3.2.2 Animal Containment Zones\n\nA containment zone designed specifically for pathogen and toxin work performed in vivo (i.e., involving living animals) is referred to as an animal containment zone. A room designed to house animals in primary containment caging (i.e., filtered containment caging designed to prevent the release of infectious material and toxins) is referred to as an \"animal room\". A room or space designed to house an animal (or animals) where the room itself serves as primary containment is referred to as an \"animal cubicle\". In general, animal containment zones include a series of co-located animal rooms or animal cubicles, as well as anterooms, associated corridors and support rooms (e.g., storage and preparation areas) of equal containment level.\n\nA zone where the animals are housed in primary containment caging inside animal rooms is termed a \"small animal containment zone\" (or SA zone). Alternatively, a zone where animals are housed in animal cubicles (i.e., the room itself provides the primary containment) is termed a \"large animal containment zone\" (or LA zone). LA zones may also include specific rooms within the containment zone where animal necropsies and dissections are conducted which are termed PM rooms. Since there are numerous additional physical containment and operational practice requirements necessary for animal containment zones where the room itself provides the primary containment (i.e., LA zones), the CBS distinguishes LA zones at CL2 and CL3 from other work areas and containment zones by designating them as CL2-Ag and CL3-Ag (i.e., CL2- and CL3-\"Agriculture\", respectively) in the requirements specified in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of the CBS.\n\nThe designation as an SA zone or LA zone is dependent on the way in which the animal is housed (primary containment caging versus the room providing primary containment) rather than the actual physical size of the animal. In general, large-sized animals and small-sized animals are housed in LA zones and SA zones, respectively. In some cases, however, small-sized animals can be housed in an LA zone. For example, a room where small-sized animals, such as chickens, are housed in an open space inside a room or where small-sized animals, such as rodents, are housed in open caging only intended to restrict animals to an area (i.e., it does not include filtration to prevent the release of infectious material and toxins), the room itself provides primary containment, and it is therefore considered an animal cubicle (i.e., an LA zone), despite the actual size of the animals. Considerations for animal work are described in more detail in Chapter 13.\n\n3.3 Identifying and Accessing a Containment Zone\n\nIt is essential to clearly identify the containment zone in order to determine compliance with respect to the corresponding requirements specified in the CBS. For example, without first identifying the containment barrier and the containment zone perimeter, it is impossible to determine the point(s) of entry and exit, to identify critical doors, or designate appropriate areas to don and doff PPE. Generally, in high containment zones (i.e., CL3 and CL4), the containment zone perimeter is determined during the design phase of the facility in order to adequately achieve all of the necessary physical containment requirements and to ensure the appropriate physical containment and appropriate level of security to the facility. In contrast, for CL2 zones, in particular in older buildings that have not been recently renovated or updated, the determination of the containment zone perimeter can be more flexible. In CL2 and CL2 LA zones (i.e., CL2-Ag) where inward directional airflow (IDA) is not provided, there is no additional containment barrier created through the flow of air, and as such, the containment zone perimeter (doors and walls) acts as the physical containment barrier as well. Ultimately, it is the decision of the highest levels of the organization's structure (e.g., senior management, institutional biosafety committee) to determine how the containment zones within a facility are identified in consideration of security and access needs and challenges, as well as the movement and flow of materials and personnel, provided that compliance with the applicable requirements specified in the CBS are met. The concepts and considerations for containment zone perimeters and containment barriers are discussed below.\n\n3.3.1 Containment Zone Perimeter\n\nThe containment zone perimeter refers to the outermost physical boundary of a containment zone (i.e., the walls, doors, windows, floors, and ceilings that enclose a single containment zone). There can be flexibility in identifying the containment zone perimeter, in particular for individual containment zones at CL2, as illustrated in Figure 3-3. In Figure 3-3(a), several co-located laboratories are grouped into a single CL2 zone, where all the rooms as well as the adjoining corridor connecting all of the rooms would be considered equal containment level (i.e., CL2). In this scenario, the containment zone perimeter follows the outer wall of this wing of laboratories. There are only two points of entry into/exit from the containment zone, which would require appropriate biohazard warning signage and closed, lockable doors, as per the physical requirements for access (CBS Matrix 3.3). In this example, the co-located office space (adjacent to the autoclave room) is located inside the defined containment zone and, consequently, all CL2 physical containment and operational practice requirements apply in order to demonstrate compliance within the zone. Figure 3-3(b), on the other hand, illustrates the same physical space of laboratories configured so that each room is a containment zone unto itself. In this scenario, there are seven separate CL2 zones identified, each with a single point of entry/exit (requiring lockable doors, biohazard signage, etc.). In Figure 3-3(b), the office space adjacent to the autoclave room is not identified as a containment zone and, therefore, is not required to meet any of the physical or operational requirements as specified in the CBS. Another point of interest is that the freezers located in the corridor in Figure 3-3(b) are located outside of the containment zone and would be required to be kept locked if they contain pathogens or toxins, and in some cases secured to the wall (e.g., if security sensitive biological agents [SSBAs] are present), to meet the requirements specified in the CBS. In contrast, the freezers in Figure 3-3(a), while in the same physical locations, are located inside the CL2 zone and do not require locks.\n\nFigure 3-4 illustrates an example of biohazard warning signage that includes all of the elements required at the point of entry to a containment zone (i.e., the international biohazard symbol, containment level, name and telephone of contact person, and entry requirements [CBS Matrix 3.3]).\n\nFigure 3-5 further illustrates the fluidity of the containment zone perimeter and the necessity to formally define the containment zone at CL2. In Figure 3-5(a) and (b), an office space is located next to a laboratory work area, accessible only through the laboratory itself. In Figure 3-5(a), the containment zone perimeter encompasses the laboratory work area as well as the office space, including both of these rooms in the CL2 zone. In this scenario, all of the physical containment and operational practice requirements for CL2 as specified in the CBS would apply equally to the laboratory work area and the office space (e.g., PPE requirements would apply in the office as well as in the CL2 laboratory work area). Figure 3-5(b), illustrates the same physical space; however, in this case, the containment zone perimeter is defined at the door to the office space. In this scenario, the office space is physically outside of the defined containment zone, and as such, the CBS requirements for CL2 would not be required for the office space. Lockable doors and other physical access requirements specified by the CBS for CL2 zones would need to be included at the entrance to the office and the appropriate operational practice requirements (e.g., exit procedures, doffing of PPE, and handwashing) would have to be followed when entering the office to be compliant with the CBS requirements. In a similar manner, entry procedures and PPE requirements would have to be followed when entering the CL2 zone from the office. It is also recommended in such a scenario, that the containment zone perimeter be visually indicated on the floor by demarcating it with a coloured line (e.g., coloured tape) to reinforce where the containment zone begins and ends. This configuration may not be achievable in CL2 work areas where inward directional airflow (IDA) is provided.\n\nIt is generally recommended to have floor plans of the containment zone and adjoining spaces, with the containment zone barrier and perimeter clearly marked, available to personnel. These can serve to assist in educating personnel and other individuals on the physical layout and the operational requirements of the containment zone; for ease of reference, these could be included in the Biosafety Manual.\n\n3.3.2 Containment Barrier\n\nThe containment barrier, which refers to the boundary between \"clean\" and \"dirty\" areas inside a containment zone, is sometimes distinct from the containment zone perimeter. In some containment zones, most notably in high containment zones, a physical containment barrier of air is achieved through inward directional airflow (IDA) created by the presence of differential air pressures. This effect creates a physical barrier of air against the release of airborne or aerosolized infectious material and toxins through the door.\n\nThe containment barrier is always encountered at or inside the containment zone perimeter. In CL2 zones where inward directional airflow (IDA) or anterooms are not present, the containment barrier often overlaps with and corresponds to (i.e., is indistinguishable from) the containment zone perimeter; however, in high containment zones, the containment barrier is encountered inside the containment zone at the point where the \"clean\" change area of an anteroom in a CL3 or CL4 zone meets the walk-through body shower. This is illustrated in Figure 3-6 in the context of a CL3 zone.\n\nIn some containment zones, it is possible to have multiple containment barriers inside the same containment zone. For example, in a large CL3 LA zone (i.e., CL3-Ag), that encompasses several animal cubicles to accommodate activities involving several different pathogens, it is likely that containment barriers would be established at each animal cubicle and PM room, as well as establishing a containment barrier at the entry/exit to the entire CL3 LA zone (Figure 3-7). This configuration helps prevent the spread of contamination from animal cubicles and PM rooms, protects against cross-contamination of experiments, and protects personnel. In this case, personnel entering an animal cubicle from outside the containment zone would cross, at minimum, two containment barriers.\n\nIn contrast, the containment barrier of CL2 zones that do not require inward directional airflow (IDA) (e.g., laboratory work areas and SA zones) may be identified by a line on the floor demarcating the \"clean\" area from the \"dirty\" area. Unless otherwise identified, the containment barrier of most CL2 laboratory work areas would correspond to the containment zone perimeter.\n\n3.3.3 Accessing the Containment Zone: Anterooms\n\nAn anteroom is a room or series of rooms inside the containment zone that separates \"clean\" areas from \"dirty\" areas (i.e., areas with a lower risk of contamination from those with a higher risk of contamination), for personnel and animal entry/exit across the containment barrier, and for entry to and exit from animal rooms, animal cubicles, and PM rooms. The presence of an anteroom at the point of entry or exit through a containment barrier creates an added buffer space to protect the outer environment from the infectious material and toxins handled within. An anteroom may also provide appropriate space at the entry/exit point(s) to don, doff, and store dedicated containment zone protective clothing and additional PPE, as required.Footnote 2Footnote 3\n\n3.3.3.1 Anteroom Configurations\n\nThe size and complexity of the anteroom(s) is dependent on the design and activities of the containment zone itself. In the most basic configuration, it can consist of a single room situated between an area free of contamination, which is not designated for activities involving infectious material or toxins (e.g., a public access corridor), and a \"dirty\" or contaminated area where infectious material or toxins are handled or stored. The anteroom(s) can serve as an access point into the work area for personnel, animals, material, and equipment. This single anteroom configuration may be incorporated into some CL2 zones, such as large scale production areas, SA zones, and LA zones. It should be noted, however, that not all containment zones at CL2 require an anteroom at the point of access. The CBS can be consulted to determine which work areas and containment zones require an anteroom.\n\nConfigurations for anterooms in CL3, CL3 LA zones (i.e., CL3-Ag), and CL4 zones are more complex and include a series of areas or rooms to prevent the spread of contamination from dedicated PPE and to prevent the migration of potentially contaminated air from the work area across the containment barrier by maintenance of inward directional airflow (IDA). Separating the \"clean\" and \"dirty\" change areas in anterooms with a walk-through body shower allows personnel to shower upon exit across the containment barrier to reduce the risk of release of infectious material contaminating the skin or hair. In CL3 zones where non-indigenous animal pathogens are not handled or stored, a local risk assessment (LRA) may be conducted to determine when a shower is or is not needed upon exit, based on the daily activities. For example, showers (upon exit) may be needed in cases where there is a risk of exposure to aerosolized or airborne pathogens (e.g., biological spill), or substantial contact with infected animals. Showers are always required upon exit from a containment zone actively handling non-indigenous animal pathogens.\n\nLikewise, anterooms for CL4 zones where positive-pressure suits are worn can be very complex and may include not only \"clean\" and \"dirty\" change areas with a walk-through body shower, but also a suit change room (which may or may not be distinct from the \"dirty\" change area) and a chemical decontamination shower.\n\nThe location of the individual spaces within the anterooms is very important and dependent on the exit sequence required for personnel exiting the containment zone. Proper design of anterooms prevents the spread of contamination beyond the containment barrier, safeguards the individual's safety, and protects against a potential exposure to the chemical decontaminants in use.\n\n3.3.3.2 Door Interlocks and Inward Directional Airflow\n\nInward directional airflow (IDA) is an essential component to maintain biocontainment in containment zones where it is required (CBS Matrix 3.5). The careful design and use of an anteroom on the containment barrier is the best way to protect the negative differential air pressures creating inward directional airflow (IDA), thereby protecting the integrity of the containment barrier. A critical door describes any door located directly on the containment barrier of a containment zone, animal cubicle, or PM room where inward directional airflow (IDA) is required. In order to maintain biocontainment and to prevent the reversal of inward directional airflow (IDA) (i.e., the migration of air from inside the \"dirty\" work area to the \"clean\" areas or outside the containment zone), the critical door must not be opened simultaneously with other doors, specifically the door leading into the anteroom from outside of the containment zone and the door(s) leading from the anteroom into the work area (i.e., laboratory work area, animal room, animal cubicle, PM room, or large scale production area). In CL3 LA zones (i.e., CL3-Ag) and CL4 zones, mechanical or electronic door interlocks are required to prevent the simultaneous opening of the critical doors with other anteroom doors that could result in a breach of containment (CBS Matrix 3.3). In CL2 LA zones (i.e., CL2-Ag) and CL3 zones, operational and administrative controls (e.g., standard operating procedures [SOPs] and appropriate signage) may be used in place of mechanical or electronic door interlocks to effectively prevent the simultaneous opening of critical doors with other key doors that could result in the release of contamination. There may be multiple critical doors identified in a containment zone, depending on containment zone design.\n\nFigure 3-8 illustrates anteroom spaces providing entry from an access corridor into a CL3 work area through a series of 3 doors, and describes the combinations of doors that, in its design, must be prevented from opening simultaneously in order to maintain the containment barrier.\n\nFigure 3-1: Representative Diagram of a Mixed-use Facility Containing Multiple Containment Level 2 (CL2) and Containment Level 3 (CL3) Zones\n\nThe solid red lines around the CL2 and CL3 zones illustrate the individual containment zone perimeters. Grey shading indicates rooms and areas that are outside of containment (e.g., public areas, offices, administrative areas, washrooms) that do not have any physical containment requirements.\n\nText Equivalent - Figure 3-1\n\nFigure 3-1: Representative diagram of a Mixed-use Facility Containing Multiple Containment Level 2 (CL2) and Containment Level 3 (CL3) Zones\n\nA representative diagram of CL2 and CL3 zones includes a CL2 laboratory work area (top left area), a CL2 SA zone (bottom right area), and a CL3 SA zone (top right area). Common basic physical features between all zones are depicted in the diagram. These include a door to separate public, office, and administrative areas (bottom left area) from the containment zone; primary containment devices (e.g., BSCs) located away from high traffic areas and doors; and handwashing sinks provided near the point of exit. Additional features depicted for the CL2 SA zone and CL3 SA zone include anterooms or clothing change areas at entry and exit points. The anteroom in the CL3 SA zone includes a walk-through body shower. The SA zone animal rooms, where animals are housed in primary containment caging, are separated from the laboratory work area by a door. Pass through chambers (optional) in the CL2 SA zone and CL3 SA zone lead to a centralized decontamination area (centre right area), which is a separate CL2 zone. A common support area for freezers and storage (bottom central area) is also shared by the containment zones.\n\nThe perimeter of each containment zone coincides with the outermost wall or door. Doors are provided between the public, office, or administrative areas, which are outside the containment zone and have no physical containment requirements, and the corridors leading to the containment zones.\n\nFigure 3-2: Representative Diagram of a Containment Level 4 (CL4) Zone Where Positive-Pressure Suits Are Worn\n\nThe solid red line around the CL4 zone illustrates the containment zone perimeter. The thin black arrows across each doorway and through the anterooms indicate the direction of traffic flow for entry and exit.\n\nText Equivalent - Figure 3-2\n\nFigure 3-2: Representative Diagram of a Containment Level (CL4) Zone where Positive Pressure Suits are Worn\n\nA representative diagram of a CL4 zone is depicted. It contains a laboratory work area across the top of the image, an animal room (SA zone) positioned at the lower right side and an animal cubicle and PM room (LA zone) positioned at the lower left side of the laboratory work area. Dedicated anterooms for personnel entry/exit to the zone are located to the left of the laboratory work area and the left of the LA zone. Both of the anterooms are comprised of a clothing/clean change area, a body shower, a suit/dirty change area, and a chemical shower. The LA zone also contains a separate anteroom at the bottom of the diagram for the entry of animals and equipment into the zone, as well as a separate anteroom for the entry of personnel from the laboratory work area. A gated area (stall) within the LA zone allows for separation of personnel and animals, and the PM room is directly accessed from the LA zone. The perimeter of the CL4 zone coincides with the outermost wall or door to the zone, and anterooms are part of the zone.\n\nFigure 3-3: Representative Diagrams of Different Containment Level 2 (CL2) Zones in the Same Physical Space\n\nContainment zones containing laboratory work areas (LWA) and support rooms are shown in orange; containment barriers are illustrated by a black hatched line.

In Figure 3-3(b), the same physical space is depicted, but without doors to limit access to the wing corridor. In this configuration, each room (i.e., laboratory work areas, cold room, cell culture room, and autoclave room) is considered a separate CL2 zone, and the corridor and office are outside the CL2 zone.\n\n(b) Individual CL2 work areas\n\nText Equivalent - Figure 3-3b\n\nFigure 3-3: Representative Diagrams of Different Containment Level 2 (CL2) Zones in the Same Physical Space\n\nThis figure depicts a wing of separate rooms (i.e., laboratory work areas, cold room, cell culture room, autoclave room, and office) off the same corridor, with freezers located in the corridor.

In this configuration, each room (i.e., laboratory work areas, cold room, cell culture room, and autoclave room) is considered a separate CL2 zone, and the corridor and office are outside the CL2 zone.\n\nFigure 3-4: Representative Biohazard Warning Signage\n\nExample of biohazard warning signage found at the points of entry to a containment zone. Biohazard warning signage must include the international biohazard warning symbol, containment level, name and telephone numbers of a contact person, and entry requirements (CBS Matrix 3.3).

The animal room on the lower left side is accessed from the laboratory work area. The containment zone perimeter coincides with the outermost walls of the zone, including the anteroom. The containment barrier coincides with the containment zone perimeter, except in the anteroom, where it coincides with the inner (containment zone side) wall of the clean change room and storage area, and the shower door leading to the clean change area.\n\nFigure 3-7: Representative Diagram of a Containment Level 3 (CL3) Large Animal Containment Zone (LA zone) that Includes Multiple Containment Barriers\n\nThe containment barrier of the containment zone is indicated with a black hatched line. The inner containment barrier (animal cubicles) is indicated with a blue dotted line and the containment zone perimeter by a solid red line.\n\nText Equivalent - Figure 3-7\n\nFigure 3-7: Representative Diagram of a Containment Level 3 (CL3) Large Animal Containment Zone (LA zone) that includes Multiple Containment Barriers\n\nThe figure shows a CL3 LA zone that includes a laboratory work area (top), two animal cubicles (lower left), and a PM room (lower centre). The containment zone is accessed through an anteroom at the top left with a clean change area, a walk-through body shower, and a dirty change area, that leads to the laboratory work area. Each cubicle and the PM room can be accessed from the laboratory work area through their own anterooms, which include a clean change area, a walk-through body shower, and a dirty change area. The animal cubicles and PM room can also be accessed through the dirty corridor (bottom of image), which is accessed through another anteroom from the laboratory work area. The bottom right corner also has an anteroom leading from outside the zone into the dirty corridor for animal entry. The containment zone perimeter coincides with the outermost walls of the entire zone, including anterooms leading into the zone. The containment barrier of the containment zone coincides with the perimeter, except in the anteroom where it coincides with the inner (containment zone side) wall of the clean change area and storage area, and the shower door leading into the clean change area. An additional (inner) containment barrier exists that surrounds the dirty corridor, the outside of the animal entry anteroom, the animal cubicles and the PM room, and the anterooms to the animal areas, except in the anterooms where it coincides with the inner (cubicle, PM room, or dirty corridor side) wall of the clean change area, and the shower door leading into the clean change area.\n\nFigure 3-8: Representative Diagram of Anteroom Spaces in a Containment Level 3 (CL3) Zone Identifying the Critical Door\n\nThe containment barrier is indicated by the black hatched line and the containment zone perimeter is shown with a solid red line. Door \"A\" leads to the \"clean\" change area of the anteroom from outside the containment zone. Door \"B\", identified in yellow, is the critical door that separates the \"clean\" and \"dirty\" change areas. The \"X\" indicates the location of a walk-through body shower in the \"dirty\" change area. Door \"C\" leads to the CL3 work area (i.e., laboratory work area, animal room, animal cubicle, PM room, or large scale production area). In order to mitigate the migration of air from the \"dirty\" change area to the \"clean\" change area or outside the containment zone into the access corridor, critical door \"B\" would have to be interlocked or otherwise protected against simultaneous opening with door \"A\" (i.e., \"A+B/B+A\"). In order to mitigate the migration of air from the CL3 work area through the \"dirty\" change room and into the \"clean\" change area, critical door \"B\" would have to be interlocked with or otherwise protected against simultaneous opening with door \"C\" (i.e., \"B+C/C+B\").\n\nText Equivalent - Figure 3-8\n\nFigure 3-8: Representative Diagram of Anteroom Spaces in a Containment Level 3 (CL3) Zone Identifying the Critical Door\n\nThe image depicts an anteroom, which includes a clean change area, walk-through body shower, and dirty change area, and a CL3 work area, in order to identify the critical door on the containment barrier, and the combinations of doors needing to be interlocked.\n\nDoor “A” on the left of the image leads to the “clean” change area of the anteroom from outside the containment zone. Door “B”, which opens from the clean change area and leads into the walk-through body shower, is the critical door that separates the “clean” and “dirty” change areas. Door “C”, to the right, leads to the CL3 work area (i.e., a laboratory work area, an animal room, an animal cubicle, a PM room, or a large scale production area). In order to mitigate the migration of air from the “dirty” change area to the “clean” change area or outside the containment zone, critical door “B” would have to be interlocked or otherwise protected against simultaneous opening with door “A” (i.e., “A+B” and “B+A”). In order to mitigate the migration of air from the CL3 work area through the “dirty” change room and into the “clean” change area, critical door “B” would have to be interlocked with or otherwise protected against simultaneous opening with door “C” (i.e., “B+C” and “C+B”).\n\nReferences\n\nChapter 4 - Risk Factors, Risk Groups, and Risk Assessments\n\n\"Risk\" is a function of the probability of an undesirable event occurring and the consequences of that event. For the safety of the community, it is essential to mitigate risks through various mechanisms, such as administrative and engineering controls, practices, and procedures. Risk assessments are conducted for many components of a biosafety program, including the evaluation of individual, community and environmental safety, biosecurity requirements, training needs, and regulatory compliance. Local risk assessments (LRAs), pathogen risk assessments, and toxin risk assessments are discussed in this chapter; overarching risk assessments and biosecurity risk assessments are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively. The requirements for risk assessments in facilities regulated by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) are specified in Matrix 4.1 of the Canadian Biosafety Standard (CBS), 2nd Edition. Footnote 1\n\n4.1 Pathogen and Toxin Risk Assessments and Risk Groups\n\nThe PHAC and the CFIA conduct pathogen and toxin risk assessments to determine the risk group (RG) of a pathogen or toxin, which is in turn used to determine the appropriate containment level to safely conduct laboratory work and other activities with the pathogen or toxin. Risk assessments on well-characterized human pathogens are developed into technical documents by the PHAC known as Pathogen Safety Data Sheets (PSDSs) that are readily available to regulated and interested parties; fact sheets for federally reportable diseases affecting terrestrial animals in Canada have also been developed by the CFIA and are readily available on the CFIA website. Regulated parties are also encouraged to conduct pathogen and toxin risk assessments, especially on uncharacterized or modified pathogens and toxins. The PHAC and the CFIA can assist individuals in their pathogen and toxin risk assessments as necessary.\n\n4.1.1 Conducting Pathogen and Toxin Risk Assessments\n\nPathogen and toxin risk assessments are based on three key elements: science, policy, and expert judgement. There is a qualitative component to a pathogen and toxin risk assessment, so a consistent approach should be used when determining risk groups, and uncertainties and assumptions should be clearly documented. In order to appropriately address all of the elements, individuals with varying expertise and responsibilities (e.g., facility director, principal investigator, senior microbiologist, biological safety officer [BSO], and institutional biosafety committee [IBC] members) should be included in the pathogen and toxin risk assessment process. Pathogen and toxin risk assessments should be reviewed routinely and revised when necessary to take into consideration relevant new information.\n\nThe pathogen risk assessment characterizes the risks associated with a pathogen based on the close examination of the following risk factors, which are the inherent characteristics of a pathogen that contribute to the risk it poses to humans and different animal species (risk factors for toxin risk assessments are discussed in Section 4.3.1):\n\nPathogenicity and Virulence: Is the pathogen able to infect and cause disease in humans or animals (i.e., pathogenicity)? What is the severity of disease in individuals or in different animal species (i.e., virulence; the degree of disease)?\n\nRoute of Infection: How does the pathogen gain entry into hosts (i.e., ingestion, inhalation, inoculation, contact with skin or mucous membranes, or genitourinary)?\n\nMode of Transmission: How does the pathogen travel to hosts? Is the pathogen transmissible by direct contact (e.g., close intimate contact or casual contact) or indirect contact (e.g., fomites, aerosolized droplets or airborne transmission)? Can the pathogen be transmitted by vectors or zoonosis?\n\nSurvival in the Environment: How stable is the pathogen outside the host? Under which environmental conditions can it survive and for how long?\n\nInfectious Dose: What amount of pathogen is required to cause an infection in the host (measured in number of organisms)?\n\nAvailability of Effective Preventive and Therapeutic Treatments: Are effective preventive measures available (e.g., vaccines)? Are effective treatments available (e.g., antibiotics, antivirals)?\n\nHost Range: What are the primary, intermediate, and dead-end hosts? Does the pathogen cause infection in a wide range of species, or is the host range more restricted?\n\nNatural Distribution: Is the pathogen present in Canada or is it exotic to Canada (i.e., non-indigenous)? Is it prevalent in a particular location, region, or human or animal population?\n\nImpact of Introduction and/or Release into the Environment or the Canadian Public: If the pathogen were introduced into the human or animal population or released into the environment (within Canada), what would be the economic, clinical, and biosecurity impact?\n\nWhile most infectious material will clearly fall into one of the four risk groups outlined below, in some cases the level of risk associated with the different risk factors can vary dramatically within a risk assessment. As a result, certain risk factors may be considered more important when determining the final risk group category. For example, if a pathogen is unlikely to cause disease in humans or a"
