        "text": "The countries of the Global South are the ones worst affected by the consequences of climate change and they often do not have the resources needed to protect their citizens from their impacts.\n\nThis challenge is discussed at international climate negotiations under the heading of Loss and Damage. The focus of the discussion is on ways the people and countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change can be supported financially and technically in dealing with loss and damage.\n\nParties at COP28 in Dubai agreed the framework for a global support structure for especially vulnerable developing countries. A new fund was established that will play a key role in the support architecture. “Funding arrangements”, both existing and yet to be established instruments for dealing with loss and damage, will also play an important role. The right combination of the fund and the funding arrangements can close protection gaps in national strategies for dealing with loss and damage. The Global Shield against Climate Risks, which constitutes a funding arrangement especially for an approach to extreme weather events, has already done important work to pave the way for this.\n\nGermany is very engaged in (further) developing support programmes for dealing with climate-related damage, with a view to providing protection against climate risks for as many people as possible.\n\nThrough its integrating and needs-oriented approach, the Global Shield against Climate Risks helps vulnerable countries to develop viable long-term protection and preparedness measures against climate risks.\n\nThe focus is on quick support through pre-arranged finance, in combination with contingency plans drawn up by developing countries. As a result, people and authorities will be able to access the assistance that they urgently need more easily and more quickly when disaster strikes.\n\nIn order to ensure that available mechanisms are carefully tailored to the financial needs of the countries in question, comprehensive country protection packages are developed under the Shield. This involves carrying out an in-country analysis and consultation process together with the partner government and further key stakeholders (civil society, private sector, international organisations, bilateral development agencies, research institutions). By analysing climate risks and the climate risk management activities that already exist, the process identifies protection gaps. On that basis, a protection package is developed.\n\nVarious instruments are available that can be used to help disburse money quickly to governments and to particularly vulnerable people when a disaster occurs.\n\nThey include, for example, social protection systems, designated disaster reserves in public budgets, loans from multilateral development banks that are disbursed in an emergency, and government bonds for which repayment can be reduced or suspended in a disaster situation. Insurance against rare events with the potential to cause a huge amount of damage can also be a useful instrument.\n\nThe basis is provided by contingency plans that a country draws up after analysing its own climate risks. Where are the biggest risks? What efficient protection and preparedness systems are needed to mitigate these risks?\n\nGovernments can use these preparedness mechanisms after climate-related damage has occurred to quickly restore the foundations for economic and social activities for the population. This fast response is very important because, if particularly vulnerable people do not get quick support when a disaster strikes, there can be long-term consequences. They may be forced to use the money that they have put to one side for investments to buy food instead. Or they may have to sell their tractor instead of using it to replant their fields. The children of these families are often not able to stay in school, because their parents are no longer able to pay the school fees or because they must work in order to contribute to the household income.\n\nThe Global Shield against Climate Risks will help to reduce the follow-on costs of disasters, accelerate economic recovery and avert the danger of people sliding into poverty."
