accordance with subsection (2) no. 2 (b) and\n\n2. the building water supply system and its mode of operation have not been modified and demonstrably conform to the generally recognised codes of practice and standards at a minimum.\n\nSentence 1 does not apply to building water supply systems in facilities referred to in section 23 (5) of the Protection Against Infection Act, to care facilities and to other facilities accommodating patients at greater risk of infection with Legionella spec.\n\n(4) In the case of newly commissioned water supply systems, the first testing in relation to the parameter Legionella spec. as required by subsection (1) is to be conducted within three to 12 months after commissioning.\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 32\n\nObligations to conduct testing in relation to radioactive substances\n\n(1) Operators of centralised water supply systems are required to establish, by conducting initial testing in accordance with the provisions of subsections (3) to (5) and (8) and by conducting regular testing in accordance with the provisions of subsections (6) to (8), whether the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I are not exceeded in the drinking water at the point at which it is transferred to the drinking water installation. The competent authority may order that the operator of a decentralised water supply system is required to comply with the obligation under sentence 1 if there are indications that parametric values for radioactive substances under section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I may be exceeded. The competent authority may order that the operator of an individual water supply system is required to conduct testing in relation to the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I if it deems this necessary to protect human health. When issuing the order as referred to in sentence 3, the competent authority determines in each instance which parameters are to be tested and the number of required tests.\n\n(2) Where drinking water is supplied from a centralised water supply system or a decentralised water supply system to another centralised or decentralised water supply system, the competent authority may determine which testing as required by subsection (1) is to be conducted in each case by the operator of which water supply system.\n\n(3) The initial testing serves to determine the annual average activity concentrations and to assess whether the parametric values for radioactive substances are being complied with. The initial testing is to be started within three months after commissioning of the water supply system. Where there are significant changes to water abstraction or water treatment which may have an adverse effect on the radionuclide content of the water, renewed initial testing is to be conducted within three months after the significant change.\n\n(4) The initial testing comprises four tests conducted in four different quarters within a one-year testing period. Drinking water testing which was conducted as part of monitoring within the meaning of section 57 may be counted towards the scope and the number of tests to be conducted as part of initial testing. The parametric value for radon-222 and tritium is deemed to have been complied with during initial testing if the average activity concentration measured over the testing period does not exceed the parametric value in question. The parametric value for the reference dose is deemed to be complied with if the average activity concentration measured in accordance with Annex 4 Parts II and III over the testing period proves that this value is not exceeded.\n\n(5) The activity concentration of radon-222 and the reference dose for natural radionuclides are to be determined during initial testing. It is only necessary to conduct initial testing of the drinking water in relation to the parametric value for tritium or other artificial radionuclides to determine the reference dose if the competent authority has ordered this on the basis of sentence 3 or 4. The competent authority may order that initial testing in relation to artificial radionuclides be conducted if there are indications that the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I may be exceeded. The authority is required to order that the reference dose be determined, taking account of artificial radionuclides, if the parametric value for tritium is exceeded.\n\n(6) Where initial testing establishes the exceedance of a parametric value for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I, regular testing of the drinking water is necessary in relation to that parametric value. This does not affect section 33 (2) no. 2. If the competent authority orders, in accordance with section 63 (1) sentence 1 in conjunction with section 62 (3), that the drinking water be treated to reduce the radionuclide content of the drinking water, then regular testing is to be conducted to check the ongoing efficacy of the water treatment.\n\n(7) Regular testing is to be conducted as from the year following that year in which initial testing was completed or after treatment measures were ordered in accordance with section 63 (1) sentence 1 in conjunction with section 62 (3). The number of regular tests which are to be conducted within a one-year period follows from Annex 6 Part II. Where the results of previous testing have shown that certain natural radionuclides are present in the water in stable activity concentrations, the competent authority may, depending on the local conditions, determine less frequent regular testing and adjust the scope of testing in relation to those natural radionuclides. Drinking water testing conducted in the context of monitoring within the meaning of section 57 may count towards the scope and frequency of regular testing.\n\n(8) The calculation and assessment of the reference dose and the performance characteristics for testing in relation to radioactive substances during initial testing and regular testing are governed by Annex 4 Parts II and III and Annex 7 Part II.\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 33\n\nExemptions from obligations to conduct testing in relation to radioactive substances\n\n(1) Initial testing need not be conducted if the competent authority has determined, on the basis of representative surveys, monitoring data or other reliable information, for a period of time it is required to set that radioactive substances are not present in a water supply zone in concentrations which are expected to lead to an exceedance of the parametric values for radioactive substances as set out in section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I.\n\n(2) The competent authority may, on application, determine for a period of time it is required to set\n\n1. that initial testing need not be conducted if the operator of a water supply system furnishes proof, based on representative surveys, monitoring data or other reliable information, of compliance with the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I and\n\n2. that regular testing need not be conducted if the operator of a water supply system furnishes proof, by means of initial testing, of the exceedance of the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I to such a negligible degree that it may be disregarded from the perspective of radiation protection.\n\n(3) The competent authority may, on application, determine that regular testing may be discontinued if the operator of a water supply system\n\n1. furnishes proof of compliance with the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I or\n\n2. furnishes proof of exceedance of the parametric values for radioactive substances laid down in accordance with section 9 sentence 2 in conjunction with Annex 4 Part I to such a negligible degree that it can be disregarded from the perspective of radiation protection.\n\ntable of contents\n\nDivision 7\n\nRisk-based approach\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 34\n\nRisk management obligation in relation to water supply systems\n\n(1) To ensure compliance with drinking water quality requirements, operators of the following water supply systems are required to carry out ongoing risk management in relation to the water supply system (risk management):\n\n1. centralised water supply systems,\n\n2. mobile and temporary water supply systems with their own water abstraction from which at least 10 cubic metres of drinking water is extracted or supplied to intermediate customers through fixed pipeworks per day or from which at least 50 persons are supplied with drinking water through fixed pipeworks.\n\n(2) Risk management is to be carried out for the first time and an application is to be made in accordance with section 38 (3) for the first time\n\n1. by the end of 12 January 2029 if the water supply system supplies more than 100 cubic metres of drinking water per day or more than 500 persons or\n\n2. by the end of 12 January 2033 if the water supply system supplies at least 10 cubic metres and at most 100 cubic metres of drinking water per day or at least 50 persons and at most 500 persons, unless the public health office has, in the particular case, required, by the end of 12 January 2026, that risk management be introduced by the end of 12 January 2029.\n\nAfter completion of the first risk management, operators of water supply systems are required to conduct a review of their risk management at six-year intervals at most and, if risk management no longer ensures that the drinking water quality requirements under Division 2 are met, to make an application in accordance with section 38 (3) to update the risk management.\n\n(3) Where the results of the assessment of the catchment area for the drinking water abstraction points and of risk management for that catchment area as provided for in the statutory instrument to be issued on the basis of section 50 (4a) of the Federal Water Act are not yet available, section 14 (2a) sentence 2 no. 3 of the Drinking Water Ordinance as published on 10 March 2016 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 459), as last amended by Article 1 of the Ordinance of 22 September 2021 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 4343), applies instead of section 35 (2) no. 1 below.

Where the raw water is supplied to the first treatment step in the water supply plant from several water abstraction systems through a commonly used collector pipe, it is sufficient to test the raw water in the collector pipe prior to the first step in the treatment chain in the water supply plant. This testing comprises the taking of four representative samples at three-month intervals and the taking of at least two event-driven samples within the same period during heavy rainfall, drought or other unusual weather events.\n\n(2) If the testing as required by subsection (1) or further raw water testing in relation to the indicator parameter somatic coliphages reveals an exceedance of the reference value for the indicator parameter somatic coliphages as set out in Annex 3 Part III, the operator is required to\n\n1. identify the causes in the catchment area for the drinking water abstraction points and\n\n2. determine the efficacy of the treatment methods and elimination capacity of the individual steps of the treatment chain and evaluate them as regards viral pathogens.\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 37\n\nProposal for adaptation or continuation of testing plan or for determination of obligations to conduct testing\n\n(1) A proposal for the adaptation or

raw water in accordance with the assessment of the catchment area for the drinking water abstraction points and risk management in relation to that catchment area as provided for in the statutory instrument to be issued on the basis of section 50 (4a) of the Federal Water Act,\n\n5. takes account of the treatment agents or disinfection methods which could be the reason for the presence of individual chemical substances and\n\n6. must, if the proposal is made for the continuation of the testing plan without any changes, include a declaration by the operator to the effect that, in line with the risk management and taking account of nos. 2 to 5, no adaptation of the testing plan is necessary.\n\n(2) A proposal for the adaptation of the testing plan as referred to in subsection (1) may propose that\n\n1. a parameter be eliminated from the testing if the documentation of the carrying out and of the results of risk management as referred to in section 35 (3) shows that for at least three years the measured values in at least two samples taken regularly and at sampling points which are representative of the water supply system as well as all the other samples taken during that period have in each case been less than 30 per cent of the limit value set under this Ordinance; the uncertainty of measurement is not taken into account when assessing the measured values

management documentation.\n\nThe public health office may require a reworking of the risk management if it does not meet the requirements referred to in sentence 1.\n\n(3) When providing the public health office with the documentation referred to in subsection (1), the operator of a water supply system makes an application for the public health office to\n\n1. approve the adaptation or continuation of the testing plan in line with the proposal made in the documentation when reaching agreement as per section 28 (2) sentence 3 or\n\n2. determine the scope and frequency of the testing
