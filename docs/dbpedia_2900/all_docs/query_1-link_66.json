        "text": "Does this change the current threat assessment process or reporting, and if so, how?\n\nLocal educational agencies should continue to follow their established threat assessment protocol when addressing a potential threat. Law enforcement should be contacted immediately when there is reasonable suspicion that the pupil is preparing to commit a homicidal act related to school or a school activity. Law enforcement will then work with the LEA to conduct the threat investigation.\n\nDoes this law change who I contact in law enforcement as part of our LEA’s threat assessment protocol?\n\nNo. LEAs are advised to follow their regular protocol for contacting law enforcement. The contact should be made immediately when there is reasonable suspicion that the pupil is preparing to commit a homicidal act related to school or a school activity. With the passage of SB 906, law enforcement has a significant role in the ongoing threat investigation.\n\nThe new law only applies to schools with grades 6 through 12. What about schools with grades TK through 5?\n\nThe directive to notify law enforcement immediately about a homicidal threat applies to only schools with grades 6 through 12; however, the directive to notify parents/guardians about laws around the safe storage of firearms applies to schools of all grade levels. All potential threats regardless of the grade of the student should be addressed using the school threat protocol.\n\nIs this just related to guns?\n\nNo. While SB 906 is generally focused on guns and gun violence, the threat of homicidal act may reference not only possession, use or depictions of firearms, but also ammunition, shootings, or targets in association with infliction of physical harm, destruction, or death. Given the broad language added by the Legislature in Ed. Code section 49390 (e), the requirements of SB 906 likely could apply to threats involving weapons beyond guns, including bombs and any other weapons intended to cause physical harm, destruction, or death.\n\nWhat is considered to be an investigation?\n\nFor the purposes of SB 906, an “investigation” must occur immediately after receiving the report and should include at a minimum: (1) a review of the firearm registry of the Department of Justice and (2) a search conducted at the school site, but only if the search is justified by a reasonable suspicion that the search would provide evidence related to the threat or perceived threat. The broad language in Education Code section 49394 around an “investigation” and “threat assessment” seems to provide broad flexibility to law enforcement and school districts to tailor the exact protocol for an investigation to the specific threat at issue, as long as the above minimum requirements are met.\n\nWith SB 906, does a school official still complete the School Threat Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)?\n\nOnce the threat has been investigated and addressed using the school threat protocol, a school official should make a School Threat Suspicious Activity report to the San Diego Law Enforcement Coordination Center. If law enforcement was involved in the investigation, they should also complete a SAR report.\n\nFor Education Code 49393 subparagraph (c) what are agencies doing to “keep a record of any report received”?\n\nSB 906 does not provide clear guidance on the best or the required method to “keep a record of any report received.” At a minimum, any report kept by the agency “shall include copies of any documentary or other evidence associated with the threat or perceived threat” in accordance with Education Code section 49393(c). Until further guidance is provided by the Legislature or the California Department of Education, we recommend that agencies follow their existing practices and procedures used for documenting student threats, including keeping a record of when schools have called law enforcement. We encourage school districts to work directly with their local law enforcement agencies to develop and/or refine reporting systems to ensure that the increased volume of threat reporting from SB 906 can be managed in an efficient and effective manner for each local community."
