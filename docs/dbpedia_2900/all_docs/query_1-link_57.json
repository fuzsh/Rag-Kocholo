Inter-agency cooperation\n\nWorking in a multi-agency partnership is the most effective way to respond to domestic violence at an operational and strategic level. Initial and ongoing training and organisational support and supervision are essential.\n\nDomestic violence has harmful impacts for individuals, families, and relationships. It affects the health, well-being and education of children witnessing or experiencing abuse. It affects the economy, businesses, and employers in the community where victims/survivors or perpetrators work. It increases demands of housing and results in other health and social care needs. All these service providers and agencies often deal with the same issues in divergent ways, with different interventions and different outcomes.\n\nPrinciples of multi-agency working\n\nTo ensure a successful partnership, certain principles can be developed and agreed on by different agencies working together. The points listed below can help professionals and organisations to draw and agree on certain principles that all agencies working together should adhere to.\n\nUnderstand that without effective prevention and early intervention domestic violence often escalates in severity and, therefore, it is important to make every effort to identify and support adult and child victims earlier.\n\nPrioritise safety of the victim-survivors and their children when considering interventions and acting immediately on disclosure of risk of harm.\n\nData about all incidents of domestic violence should be recorded, analysed, and shared with management of agencies working together regularly and appropriately.\n\nEncourage cooperation with institutions and authorities that work with perpetrators in order to assess risks on a multi-professional basis and to prevent new incidents of violence.\n\nAt the initial engagement with the services, informed consent of the victim-survivor should be gained to ensure information between agencies can be shared, when required, without unnecessary delay.\n\nWork cooperatively to provide a supportive and enabling environment which encourages people to report domestic violence to the police and other professionals and agencies.\n\nRespect confidentiality and privacy wherever possible and understand the risks associated with information sharing in the context of domestic violence.\n\nDevelop and adhere to shared policies and procedures to guide information sharing between different organisations.\n\nEnsure that victim-survivors are treated with respect and dignity. By listening to them and believing their experiences and assuring them that they are never to blame.\n\nEmpower domestic violence victim-survivors to make well-informed choices and decisions for themselves, wherever possible. Do not make decisions for them without their involvement.\n\nEnsure that services are sensitive to the diverse need of the victim-survivors considering their age, disability, gender, race or ethnicity, religion or belief, sexual orientation, but recognise that such differences are not used as an excuse for accepting or perpetrating domestic violence or other harmful practices.\n\nRecognise that victim-survivors and their children are most at risk when attempting to leave an abusive relationship or seeking help.\n\nChallenges associated with multi-agency working\n\nMulti-agency working has its own challenges. Fundamentally, different agencies and service providers have different organisational missions, visions, values, aims and objectives. They have different targets and tasks and may also have different rules, regulations and working mechanisms. This makes it difficult for professionals in these agencies to work together at the same pace. There could also be a lack of understanding of the role and responsibilities of staff and the language used by individuals and organisations could be different leading to issues in working together.\n\nA good example to elaborate this is the difference in the language, definitions and labels used to refer to the victim-survivor with various labels in operation including ‘victim’ (criminal justice system), ‘survivor’ (women-centred organisations), ‘patient’ (healthcare services), ‘tenant’ (housing services), ‘service user’ (welfare agencies) and ‘customer’ (adults’ social care). When working with perpetrators, the term victim is also used in the sense of criminal law, but it can also refer to ‘relatives’ and ‘clients’ in general.\n\nData gathered by different agencies is not comparable due to variations in the type of data collected, ways it is recorded, data storage and lack, or data portability mechanisms. There may also be different understandings of what constitutes domestic violence and its impact among different organisations. High staff turnover in organisations is also a barrier and affects communication as it takes time for people to develop trusting relationships.\n\nIn addition, different services do not always communicate with each other, and are often not allowed to exchange information, partly for data protection reasons, resulting in the lack of sharing information. Consequently, the victims must repeatedly provide their information, including details of their abusive experiences to different people in different organisations. Recalling experiencing can itself be traumatic for victim-survivors and consequently may deter them from accessing support.\n\n2. Risk assessment\n\nRisk assessment is a cornerstone in domestic violence prevention. The purpose of domestic violence risk assessment is to prevent repetitious violence by identifying the perpetrator’s risk of recidivism , circumstances that may increase the risks of violence as well the victim’s vulnerability factors by conducting a risk assessment and implementing interventions to manage the sources of risks.\n\nRisk assessment is needed in the safety planning of the victim and in managing the sources of risks, these are the main key points:\n\nIt is essential to assist victims in evaluating both their present and future safety, along with that of their children.\n\nOften victims do not want to go to other specialised services immediately or report to the police. Therefore, it is very important that members of the health sector have some background knowledge about risk assessment and how to ask and support victims accordingly.\n\nA comprehensive risk assessment, following best practices, involves gathering pertinent information about the domestic environment, inquiring about the victim’s perception of risk, and making a professional judgment regarding current risk factors. This is usually done by specialised victim support services or the police.\n\nA risk assessment and a clear protocol for referring victims with injuries resulting from domestic violence to further interventions after an emergency room visit are required. The disclosure of domestic violence is also associated with certain reporting and notification obligations, which vary depending on the professional group.\n\nThis may concern the reporting and notification obligations of pedagogical and psychosocial occupational groups in cases of suspected immediate danger to self or others and danger to the well-being of children.\n\nMedical professions are also subject to special reporting obligations, which are regulated in the respective professional laws.\n\nMake sure to\n\nprioritise victim’s safety\n\nadopt a victim-centred approach\n\ntake a gender-sensitive approach\n\napply an intersectional approach: “The characteristics of each individual case are considered when identifying victims’ individual safety needs, including the victim’s gender and gender identity or expression, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, residence status, communication difficulties, relationship to or dependence on the perpetrator and previous experience of crime.”\n\nIt is highly suggested to use a standardised risk assessment instead of using one gut feeling. Many institutions have their standard risk assessment tool they usually use. This can vary however between institutions and countries.\n\nRisk assessment instruments\n\nFind the internationally most frequently used risk assessment instruments here:\n\nDanger Assessment (DA),\n\nThe Danger Assessment is an instrument that helps to determine the level of danger for an abused woman of being killed by her intimate partner.\n\nThere are two parts to the tool: a calendar and a 20-item scoring instrument. The calendar helps to assess severity and frequency of battering during the past year. The calendar portion was conceptualised as a way to raise the woman’s consciousness and reduce the denial and minimisation of the abuse, especially since using a calendar increases accurate recall in other situations.\n\nThe 20-item instrument uses a weighted system to score yes/no responses to risk factors associated with intimate partner homicide. Some of the risk factors include past death threats, partner’s employment status, and partner’s access to a gun.\n\nThe tool is currently available in English , Spanish, Canadian French and Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nA short four-item version called the Lethality Assessment has been developed for use by law enforcement officials responding to domestic violence calls. Women at high risk are then referred to advocates who have been trained in the Danger Assessment.\n\nDomestic Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (DVRAG)\n\nThe Domestic Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (DVRAG) contains the same items as the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA), but also incorporates psychopathy checklist-revised (PCL-R) findings. The DVRAG is a 14-item actuarial tool which assesses the probability of Intimate Partner Violence perpetrated by males against a female partner, and how this risk compares with that of other abusers. These tools may also predict the speed and number of recidivistic offenses and the severity of injuries caused. The general scoring criteria include the instructions for scoring and interpreting the ODARA in any setting. DVRAG is intended for use by forensic clinicians and criminal justice officials who can access in-depth information.\n\nDASH Risk Assessment\n\nDASH stands for domestic abuse, stalking and ‘honour’-based violence. The risk assessment tool was the outcome of documenting 47 domestic homicides and cataloguing the key risk variables to develop the DASH risk model. The DASH checklist is used by a number of agencies in Scotland, including the police. However, it has not been introduced everywhere in Scotland. The DASH risk checklist is supposed to be a consistent and simple tool for practitioners who work with adult victims of domestic abuse. It is supposed to help them identify those who are at high risk of harm and whose cases should be referred to a MARAC meeting in order to manage their risk.\n\nVideo introducing risk identification in domestic violence cases utilising the DASH RIC checklist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB00K1jiFUc&t=23s\n\nBIG 26\n\nThe Domestic Abuse Intervention Program (DAIP) in Duluth, Minnesota, USA, has developed 26 questions to assess the danger emanating from a perpetrator. The Duluth model emphasises the importance of an interagency cooperation and coordinated community response to battering, of victim safety and offender accountability.\n\nDyRiAS Intimate Partner\n\nDyRiAS stands for Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems. DyRiAS Intimate Partner has been in operation in Germany, Austria and Switzerland since January 2012. On the one hand, the instrument measures the risk of committing acts of serious violence against the intimate partner. In addition, a separate scale measures the risk of mild to moderate physical violence. DyRiAS-Intimate Partner only records violence in heterosexual relationships, starting with the male (former) partner. The duration of the current or former relationship is immaterial and can range from a short to a long-term relationship. In total, DyRiAS Intimate Partner comprises 39 items.\n\nMulti-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC)\n\nA MARAC is a meeting where information is shared on the highest risk domestic abuse cases between representatives of local police, health, child protection, housing practitioners, Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs), probation and other specialists from the statutory and voluntary sectors. They talk about the victim, the family and perpetrator, and share information. The meeting is confidential. Together, the participants write an action plan for each victim. At the heart of a MARAC is the working assumption that no single agency or individual can see the complete picture of the life of a victim, but all may have insights that are crucial to their safety.\n\n3. Excursus: Domestic violence in times of disasters\n\nQuarantine, restrictions, closed schools, home office, short-time work, financial worries, and fear of the future – all these factors have the potential to cause increased stress in relationships and family life. It is therefore suspected that there has been and will continue to be a significant increase in violence at home. As on example how disasters can have an impact, COVID-19 is presented here as case study.\n\nSome risk factors for an increase in domestic included:\n\nHealth and mental health problems increased during a lockdown situation, as health-related services are only accessible to a limited extent. This had a negative impact on the health status of individuals, increase their stress levels and often resulted in an increase in violent assaults.\n\nEconomic insecurity or unemployment is accompanied by financial worries can reinforce destructive coping mechanisms.\n\nViolence always has to do with power. In times of crisis and isolation and the associated feelings of helplessness, loss of control and powerlessness, violence is supposedly a means of regaining control and power.\n\nLanguage barriers, closures of contact points or the fact that social workers are only present on site to a limited extent due to the protective measures can made access to support services considerably more difficult.\n\nVictims were also reluctant to take advantage of support services for fear of contracting COVID-19.\n\nSocial distancing can limit the social contacts of individuals to such an extent that victims may not dare to seek help without the closeness and encouragement of caregivers. Similarly, caregivers, acquaintances, or outsiders, such as employers or educational staff, do not become aware of the problem and cannot act as supporters. On the other hand, neighbours are more alert and present and, due to the initial restrictions, must be considered a protective factor.\n\nDomestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic in EU countries\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase of domestic violence was reported in EU countries.\n\nReports to the police are often received with some delay or not reported at all. Also, incidents are more often reported by people victims relate to. Also, the COVID-19-related restrictions prevented reporting because of the lack of social contacts. Therefore, more cases than usual may have stayed undetected. As a result, it can be assumed that there is a high number of unreported cases.\n\nThis logic can explain why, in addition to an increase in reported cases of domestic violence in many areas, there was a decrease in numbers in others. This could be due to the fact that the perpetrator was always present at home so that the victim had no opportunity to call for help and/or report a crime without risking an escalation.\n\nThe document “The COVID-19 pandemic and intimate partner violence against women in the EU” offers a preliminary overview of the measures undertaken across the EU to support victims of violence during the COVID-19 outbreak (from March until the end of September 2020). It identifies examples of promising practices and provides initial recommendations for the EU and Member States on how to better support victims during the pandemic, as well as in other potential crises.\n\nRecommendations to combat and better detect domestic violence during the pandemic\n\nThe lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 in spring 2020 also brought the issue of domestic violence increasingly into the public and police attention.\n\nIt was reported in the media, in politics and by NGOs that under COVID-19 conditions, especially women and children experience increased violence. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has also supported calls for the EU and its Member States to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to step up their efforts to protect women’s rights.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) and UN women have underlined the importance of data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a crucial tool to mitigate adverse effects on women and girls affected by violence, and to develop prevention strategies for future crises. For the future, it is crucial that research provides immediate and longer-term policies and practical responses.,\n\nThe following recommendations were phrased:\n\nLaw enforcement authorities must ensure that domestic violence incidents are given high priority and that the manifestations of violence associated with COVID-19 are addressed.\n\nThe health sector must always ensure that victims of domestic violence have access to sexual and reproductive health information and services.\n\nSocial sector support services should provide more online crisis support services such as hotlines and chats. Emergency care/day care services should be extended to all families – not only to parents working in systemically important jobs.\n\nHow can victims of domestic violence be supported during a pandemic?\n\nIf victims of domestic violence do not want to turn to the police or help services because they do not trust state institutions or have already had bad experiences, the first step out of the violent situation can be taken with help lines or chats if this can be done safely at home. Further help is possible afterwards.\n\nIt is important that victims are always made aware that the blame never lies with them, and that what is happening is wrong. A clear statement and condemnation of domestic violence in the media – especially in times of pandemics – helps those affected to seek further support.\n\nConcerns about the economic consequences after separation can make it difficult for victims of domestic violence to find a way out of their situation. Some victims are financially dependent on their partner, for example because they are no longer able to go to paid work due to caring for family members and childcare, or because they were dismissed in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some countries, like Germany, have a functioning system of assistance to alleviate financial hardship for victims of domestic violence after a separation. This is not the case in other countries.\n\nWritten information on violence in intimate relationships and domestic violence should be available in public spaces in the form of posters and brochures or leaflets which are made available in private areas such as washrooms (with appropriate warnings not to take them home if the perpetrator is there). Offering a QR code that leads to a website with further information can help. The posters, brochures or leaflets should be aimed at female and male victims of domestic violence and not use stereotypes. The designation of concrete contact persons on site and the provision of telephone numbers of counselling centres or websites offering (anonymous) counselling can help victims of domestic violence to seek help.\n\nIn case of acute threat, victims should call the police emergency number. They should state their name, address, further information and, if necessary, the perpetrator’s possession of a weapon, and emphasise that help is needed immediately. Until the police’s arrival, victims and any children should take themselves to safety, for example to neighbours or shops.\n\n4. Cooperation between agencies with focus on the police\n\nCase study: Domestic violence has a negative impact on children\n\nGabby married her husband Nick after a long relationship and shortly thereafter moved to her husband’s family farm. The couple was happy at the farm and soon had their first child. During the pregnancy Nick’s behaviour began to change and by the time their daughter was born the relationship did not ‘feel’ as it had before. Nick seemed withdrawn and spent long periods of time by himself. He began to remind Gabby of Nick’s father who had always been a stern presence in his life.\n\nNick’s behaviour became threatening and controlling, especially in relation to money and social contact. He was increasingly aggressive in arguments and would often shout and throw objects around the room. Gabby thought that, because he wasn’t physically hurting her, his behaviour did not qualify as abuse. Nick did not show much interest in their daughter, Jane, except when in public, where he would appear to be a doting and loving father.\n\nJane was generally a well-behaved child, however, Gabby found that she was unable to leave her with anyone else. Jane would cry and become visibly distressed when Gabby handed her to someone else to be nursed. This was stressful for Gabby, and also meant that her social activities were limited further.\n\nJane took a long time to crawl, walk and begin talking. Her sleeping patterns were interrupted, and Gabby often did not sleep through the night, even when Jane was over 12 months of age. When Jane did begin to talk, she developed a stutter, and this further impeded her speech development. Gabby worried about Jane a lot. Their family doctor told her that this was normal for some children and that, if the speech problems persisted, she could always send Jane to a specialist at a later date.\n\nAfter a number of years, Nick’s behaviour became unacceptable to Gabby. During arguments he would now hold on to the rifle that he had for farming purposes, and Gabby found this very threatening. On a number of occasions, items that Nick threw hit Gabby and she was increasingly afraid for their daughter. Gabby decided to leave and consulted the local women’s service, who assisted her to get an intervention order against Nick.\n\nOnce Gabby had taken Jane away from Nick, her behaviour changed. Jane’s development seemed to speed up and Gabby couldn’t understand why. As part of her counselling at a local women’s service, she discussed this issue, and her counsellor recognised the developmental delay, stutter, irritation, and separation anxiety as effects of Jane’s previously abusive situation.\n\nThis can be seen as a missed opportunity for identifying family violence. If the family doctor would have asked Gabby or Nick (who had presented with chronic back pain) about their relationship, about what was happening to the family, and specifically to Jane, the situation could have been identified much earlier.\n\nTask for reflection\n\na) What could have been done better by those involved?\n\nb) Take a moment to consider which agencies and professionals should have been involved in supporting and/or providing services to Gabby from the beginning.\n\nc) Make a list of different professionals who make up the multidisciplinary team in your organisation and who could be involved in the provision of services for those who have experienced domestic violence (this will vary depending upon where you are based).\n\nThe wide range of professionals, provider services and specialist agencies who may be involved in supporting victim-survivors of domestic violence can include—but are not limited to—primary and secondary health care services, mental health services, sexual violence services, social care, criminal justice agencies, the police, probation, youth justice, substance misuse, specialist domestic violence agencies, children’s services, housing services and education.\n\nAdapted from a case study from RACGP (2014): Abuse and Violence: Working with our patients in general practice\n\nReferrals to health and social service providers\n\nWork with other service providers to develop and implement integrated protocols and effective referral networks to:\n\nlink victims with needed health and social services like shelters, medical and psychological care institutions,\n\ninstitutionalise coordinated efforts,\n\ndevelop standards for referral services,\n\nensure all communications between service providers are non-judgmental, empathetic, and supportive,\n\nidentify the need for standardised data sharing protocols.\n\nCommunication between justice agencies\n\nEnsure effective information sharing amongst justice service providers, including:\n\ninformed consent for disclosure of information is sought from the victim/survivor and/or parents/guardians and legal representative, wherever possible,\n\ninformation is shared within privacy and confidentiality requirements,\n\ndisclosure of information is for the purpose for which it was obtained or compiled or for a use consistent with that purpose,\n\ndevelop protocols and referral mechanisms that promote timely and efficient flow of information amongst service providers.\n\nProcedures and information sharing\n\nEntities shall establish written procedures on risk assessment and risk management, in particular on objectives, responsibilities and roles of professionals, duration and methodologies of risk assessment and management, namely:\n\nthe identification of relevant sources of information, such as the history of violence revealed by the victim/survivor;\n\nthe definition of the instruments to be used;\n\nthe design of situational safety plans.\n\nThe information obtained from the risk assessment should be contained in a clear and objective written report and should cover several areas: history of violence, psychosocial history, current psychosocial adjustment of the offender, context of the victim/survivor’s experience and a conclusive opinion on the risk of violence presented.\n\nMulti-institutional cooperation is of paramount importance for increasing the safety of women and children and requires a process of information sharing.\n\nSharing information between different organisations can contribute to this:\n\nfinding new ideas and solutions in the area of prevention and intervention, making them more coherent and effective,\n\nminimising new incidents of domestic violence.\n\nThe sharing of information may conflict with one of the basic principles of intervention: confidentiality and the right to privacy. Information collection and dissemination strategies must take into account accepted ethical standards, respecting human rights.\n\nThe sharing of information should comply with the following principles.\n\nSafety: information should be shared in a safe way and should not increase the level of risk to the victim/survivor and children by placing them in a more vulnerable situation.\n\nObjectivity: information should be transmitted in an objective way, without any value judgement.\n\nNeed: only information relevant to the creation of an effective safety plan should be considered.\n\nScenario: Victim files a complaint without any current incident\n\nThe victim comes to a police station and files a complaint without any current incident.\n\nTask\n\nDiscuss the following.\n\nWhat measures are available to you?\n\nThe answers to this task can be found in the corresponding sections of this module.\n\nPossible answers\n\nClarification and recording of the facts: who is the perpetrator? How many incidents of domestic violence have there been? Over what period of time? In what intensity? etc.\n\nSearch for possibilities of subsequent preservation of evidence: were there witnesses? Were there visits to the doctor? Are there confidants? Is there evidence in another form?\n\nInformation about rights and obligations, the course of proceedings\n\nRisk assessment and, if necessary, initiation of the protective measures that appear necessary (with reference to the offender, for example: addressing the perpetrator, expulsion, prohibition of approach and contact, detention; with regard to the victim: victim protection talk, shelter if necessary)\n\nDissemination of information about support services (NGOs, public sector)\n\nMediation into the aid network, e.g., through a proactive approach\n\n5. Criminal procedure in cases of domestic violence\n\nIn the criminal procedure for cases of domestic violence, several essential steps are followed to ensure a thorough and just response.\n\nDomestic violence occurs: Firstly, the process typically begins when an incident of domestic violence occurs within a domestic or familial setting or in a (former) relationship. This can involve various forms of violence, including physical, psychological, sexual, digital, or financial.\n\nReport: The reporting of the incident is often made by the victim or a concerned party, and it serves as the formal initiation of the legal process. Reporting can be a challenging decision for a victim, and the victim’s decision not to report, should be respected. However, reporting the violence can be an important step toward seeking assistance and holding perpetrators accountable. In some European countries, for example in France, the police investigation continues even when the victim does not wish to make a report.\n\nDocumentation: The documentation involves gathering statements from the victim, witnesses, and the alleged perpetrator. In addition to verbal accounts, officers may collect physical evidence, such as photographs of injuries, and secure any relevant documents or objects that could be used as evidence in court.\n\nSupport: Simultaneously, victims are offered immediate support and protection. This can include medical attention for injuries, counselling services, or shelters to ensure their safety. Social workers or support organisations may become involved to address the emotional and practical needs of the victim during this challenging time.\n\nInvestigation: A critical phase in the process is the investigation stage. Law enforcement agencies conduct a thorough examination of the case, with the goal of building a comprehensive case file. This entails gathering additional evidence, interviewing witnesses, and assessing the credibility of all parties involved. The aim is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support criminal charges against the alleged perpetrator.\n\nProsecution: Finally, if the investigation yields enough evidence, the case is referred to the prosecutor’s office. Prosecutors review the case and decide whether to file charges against the alleged perpetrator. If charges are filed, the legal proceedings move forward. This may involve court hearings, trials, and potential penalties for the accused, ultimately aiming to ensure justice, protect victims, and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n\nThe following illustration shows the individual steps of the criminal procedure in cases of domestic violence and explains how they are connected:\n\n6. National criminal procedures\n\nCriminal procedures do vary nationally. This is highlighted exemplarily by the criminal procedures in cases of domestic violence applied in Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Finland, France, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden:\n\n7. Risk Assessment Integration Module (RAIMO)\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe learning objectives of this module are to become familiar with the domestic violence risk assessment process, risk and vulnerability factors and the purpose of multi-agency cooperation in risk management.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDear frontline responder, welcome to learn about the domestic violence risk assessment process in a multiprofessional context!\n\nThe purpose of this modular tool is to link various risk assessment procedures and enhance the identification of domestic violence among key agencies (e.g., police officers, social work and healthcare professionals, NGO workers, educators) who come into contact with victim-survivors and perpetrators. This tool demonstrates different risk factors and different approaches to identifying and responding to risk.\n\nYou can use this tool e.g., as a training material or a database.\n\nWe present the four steps of the domestic violence risk assessment process from risk identification all the way to follow-up.\n\nThe Good-read section provides you with recommendable reading. From the Materials section you will find printable items such as checklists. Do not forget to print your own pocket version of the risk assessment checklist – with it, you may save somebody’s life.\n\nContent:\n\nStep 1: Identification of risk factors\n\nStep 2: Risk assessment\n\nStep 3: Outlining necessary actions\n\nStep 4: Follow-up\n\nGood-read\n\nMaterials\n\nStep 1: Identification of risk factors\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe learning objectives of this module are to become familiar with the domestic violence risk and vulnerability factors and to understand why all the professionals should have basic knowledge regarding the risk identification.\n\nRisk assessment is a process, that begins with identifying the presence of risk factors and determining the likelihood of an adverse event occurring, its consequences and its timing.,\n\nThis is Nora. She will be our guide in demonstrating the steps of risk assessment.\n\nRead first about Nora’s case and then learn more about risk identification.\n\nCase scenario\n\nNora is a 34-year-old woman with an immigrant background. She has lived here in your country for three years with her parents and sisters. Nora married Peter two years ago. Peter is the son of a family friend of Nora’s parents. Nora’s family comes from a patriarchal culture where the community comes before the individual.\n\nNora’s marriage with Peter was a relief for Nora’s family since in their culture a woman at Nora’s age should not be single. However, quite soon after Nora and Peter got married, Peter started to control her everyday behaviour. Peter does not let Nora see her friends or go anywhere without him. A mandatory language course is the only place where Nora can go alone.\n\nPeter takes away Nora’s debit card and takes loans under her name. When Nora tries to resist, Peter turns violent and abuses her. Peter threatens to send Nora back to her home country.\n\nNora discloses the situation to her parents, asking for help. First, the parents take Peter’s violent behaviour seriously, but suddenly Nora’s father passes away. Nora’s grieving mother is not capable of standing against Peter’s will on her own.\n\nAt the same time, Peter spreads rumours about Nora’s immorality in order to justify the claims of his violent actions to their community. The rumours humiliate Nora’s family. The community pressures Nora’s mother and her sisters’ families to clear their name.\n\nNora’s mother begs Nora to stay with Peter to calm the situation and her sisters ask her not to bother their mother with the issue any more. Nora feels that she is responsible for the violence and her family’s reputation, and accepts that divorcing Peter is out of the question.\n\nOver time, the violence gets more serious and more frequent. On one occasion, Peter strangles Nora for so long that she loses consciousness. After the strangulation, she starts to have speech impairment issues especially in stressful situations. Nora feels isolated, helpless and depressed.\n\nPeter has threatened to share some private pictures of Nora in public if Nora ‘ruins his reputations as a husband’, as he puts it. Nora feels anxious since she cannot talk to anyone – even her family – about her feelings.\n\nTasks\n\nThis was the story of Nora. Take one minute to think of the following questions:\n\n(1) Which acts, situations or conditions endanger Nora?\n\n(2) Which situations described in the story you consider unfortunate but not your business as a frontline responder?\n\nThere may be some risk factors that do not concern your profession. However, identifying and documenting these risk factors is important in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the sources of risks. This is needed in the phase of risk management.\n\nNow, read more about the identification and documentation of risk factors.\n\nRisk factors to identify\n\nCritical domestic violence risk factors\n\nKey point: There may be some risk factors that do not concern your profession. However, identifying and documenting these risk factors is important in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the sources of risks. This is needed in the phase of risk management.\n\nSeveral factors may indicate escalation of domestic violence. Every frontline responder should have sufficient training and knowledge to be able to identify these critical risk factors. By every frontline responder, we mean uniformed police officers, crime detectives, social workers, nurses, doctors, educators or NGO workers.\n\nIn the table below, we present the critical risk factors and their explanations.\n\nRisk related information to check by each professional\n\nKey agencies should work to a shared understanding of risk, but the nature of their work may mean that they will be able to identify different risk factors. The perspective of a police officer differs from the perspective of a social worker. In the table below, we present the risk factors that relate to different professionals’ perspectives.\n\nVictim’s vulnerability factors\n\nKey point: Identification of victim’s vulnerability factors helps professionals to invite the relevant key agencies in the cooperation, to support the victim in a holistic manner, and to strengthen the victim’s capacity to follow the security strategies.\n\nVictim’s vulnerability factors relate to the victim’s person and life circumstances. They may relate, e.g., to the capacity to trust public authorities, leave the abuser, or the dependency on the abuser. However, these are not reasons why the abuse happens. Perpetrators may choose to exploit vulnerabilities of victims; some victims’ life experiences and circumstances may make it more difficult to survive or escape abuse. Below we have listed the vulnerability factors and explained why and how these factors may affect the victim’s resources and life situations as well as the ability to cooperate with the professionals.\n\nElderly person\n\nA victim may be dependent on a violent family member or the victim may be the only responsible caregiver for a violent family member. Thus, leaving a violent family member may not be an option for the victim. Victim may already be socially isolated.\n\nLeaving may require moving to a new address and securing the contact information.\n\nA perpetrator may have experienced caregiver burnout.\n\nAn elderly person may experience overwhelming shame for the situation especially if the perpetrator is an adult child.\n\nAbuse can occur in many forms, such as physical, sexual, emotional, or financial abuse, negligence, isolation and abandonment. Note also signs of depriving of dignity (e.g., untidy appearance, soiled clothes) or choice over daily affairs, signs of insufficient care (e.g., pressure sores) or over- or under-medicating.\n\nMinor\n\nMinors are nearly always dependent on the perpetrators.\n\nGrowing up in a hostile environment normalises the experiences of violence and thus the victims may not perceive their experiences as violence.\n\nMinors may think their experiences are not believed by the outsiders.\n\nThe patterns of coercive control, such as restriction, isolation and a deprivation of personal freedom may be difficult to discriminate from parental upbringing and protective measures.\n\nNote: In some immigrant or otherwise socially or religiously strongly controlled families, differences between cultural values, lifestyles and views may inflict conflicts between the minors and their parents. Authorities’ non-diplomatic contacts or rash measures may increase the risk that the parents send the child to their native countries to boarding schools or to be raised by relatives. This may increase the risk for FGM, child-marriage as well as breaks in education, social relations and integration.\n\nDisabled person\n\nDisabled persons may be functionally dependent on the perpetrator in everyday life, needing assistance in moving, eating, communicating, medicating.\n\nThe violent family members or caregivers may experience caregiver burnout.\n\nVictim-survivors may have difficulties to make themselves heard, understood or believed.\n\nThe perpetrator may explain injuries as accidents caused by dyskinesia.\n\nDependency on perpetrator\n\nThere are several forms of dependency such as financial and emotional dependency. Also structural reasons such as hierarchical gender relations or rural disparity contribute to dependencies; for instance, when compared to urban women, rural women experience higher rates of domestic violence yet live farther away from available resources.\n\nRefugee background\n\nRates of mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders, PTSD and depression are higher among refugee populations in comparison to the general population. This increased vulnerability is linked to experiences prior to migration, such as war exposure and trauma. In addition, language barriers or negative experiences of police and distrust towards authorities may prevent the victims from seeking help.\n\nHomeless person\n\nHomelessness is often a consequence of domestic violence and it increases the vulnerability and dependency of the victim. Social marginalisation may prevent the victims from seeking help.\n\nVictim belongs to an ethnic minority\n\nLanguage barriers, negative or discriminative experiences of the police, fear of not being believed, experiences of racism, social marginalisation or the power of parallel societies may prevent the victims from seeking help.\n\nVictim belongs to sexual or gender minority\n\nA victim may fear of being ‘outed’ to family members, friends, and co-workers if they report police about domestic violence. A victim may fear discrimination or disrespectful treatment by the police.\n\nStrong fear\n\nFear of an abusive partner may weaken women’s ability to improve their life situations. An atmosphere of fear is likely to increase maladaptive thinking patterns inhibiting problem-solving and increasing denial and avoidance.\n\nMental health issues\n\nApart from being a consequence of domestic violence, e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can also be a risk factor for IPV revictimisation.\n\nFamily or community is justifying violence based on honour/culture/religion\n\nIf the family or the community of the victim approves and justifies violence, the victim may be extremely scared, isolated, coerced and controlled. The victim may feel powerless to seek help. For many victims it may be an unthinkable to abandon their entire community to live without violence, and even if they did so, leaving the family or community may escalate the violence.\n\nGuidelines for case documentation\n\nKey point: Case documentation of domestic violence is an important procedure. The professionals may need previously documented information in the dynamic risk assessment and management process. Standardised risk assessment tools support frontline responders’ work in documenting the case.\n\nSince risk assessment is – or at least should be – a dynamic process that needs be started over again if the risk situation changes, case documentation of domestic violence and its’ risk factors is an important procedure. A careful case documentation should ensure that the professional find previously documented information to revise the risk assessment. Standardised risk assessment tools support frontline responders’ work in documenting the case. Nevertheless, risk assessment should not endanger the victim’s safety at any point. Thus, there should be clear protocols and safety restrictions for documenting the risk assessment, risk management and certain risk factors. For example, this data should not be included the pre-trial investigation records that are part of the judicial process: the perpetrator should not have access to victim-survivors’ risk assessment documentation. Data protection and the boundaries confidentiality as well as the victim-survivors consent to share information are key issues when intervening domestic violence and abuse.\n\nIn the tables below we present the basic guidelines for the case documentation.\n\nGuidelines for case documentation for police, social work and health care\n\nStep 2: Risk assessment\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe learning objectives of this module are to become familiar with the domestic violence risk assessment procedure, different risk assessment tools and high-risk moments that may increase the risk.\n\nRisk assessment is a phase, during which the level of the risk and its nature are assessed. Start with reading how risks are assessed in Nora’s case. Then take a look at risk factors, risk assessment and high-risk moments, as well as aspects of best practice risk assessment and risk assessment tools described in Module 5.\n\nCase scenario: Nora\n\nOne day Nora finds a phone number of an NGO that helps immigrant women. The phone service is also in Nora’s native language. Nora calls the service phone anonymously to ask for legal advice about what happens to her residence permit in the case of a divorce. The NGO worker asks Nora about her life situation. Nora discloses her difficult situation and anxiety.\n\nThe NGO worker meets Nora at the school after the language course since it is the only place where Nora can go alone. With Nora’s consent, the NGO worker contacts the police and a responsible social service worker.\n\nIn some EU-countries the legislation allows the professionals to share and exchange information for more comprehensive risk assessment, if it is necessary to protect a child, to prevent a violent act or if the victim has given her consent. In some EU-countries, however, there is no legislative support in relation to information exchange between the police, social work or health care sectors. Hence, multi-agency mechanisms within the EU range from the adoption of formal or informal referral mechanisms to the presence of multidisciplinary teams or conferences that are mandated by legislation or by policy documentation on risk assessment.\n\nThe Istanbul Convention requires the State parties to take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that an assessment of the lethality risk, the seriousness of the situation and the risk of repeated violence is carried out by all relevant authorities in order to manage the risk and if necessary to provide co‐ordinated safety and support.\n\nThe next example of how Nora’s case is brought into the multi-agency risk assessment process is based on the requirements of the Istanbul Convention. This may differ from your national legislation.\n\nWith the consent of Nora, the police, the social service worker, the NGO worker and a representative of the health care sector participate in a risk assessment conference. Nora has given her consent that the professionals can share and exchange information regarding Nora.\n\nLook at the boxes to see what kind of information can be collected by multi-agency co-operation:\n\nIf Nora is asked about her situation, she may tell us this:\n\n– Her speech issues developed four months ago after Peter had strangled her.\n\n– She fears that Peter will kill her if she separate from him.\n\n– She is worried that her residence permit will be cancelled if she separates; this is what Peter has told her.\n\n– She is worried that the police will not believe her since she is an immigrant but Peter has the nationality of this country.\n\n– Peter has told that he will publish private sexual pictures of her if she tells anyone about the violence or tries to leave him.\n\n– Peter has said that he will make sure that no decent man will ever even look at Nora if she separates from Peter.\n\nThe identified risk factors\n\nThe purpose of risk assessment tools is to help frontline responders identify all the risk factors and to create a complete overview of the victim’s situation in order to ascertain whether she remains at risk of serious harm and can assist in the development of a safety plan.\n\nA calculation of the probability of becoming a victim of serious violence does not help the victim, but the calculation and the frontline responders’ own judgment of the situation support the frontline responders in taking necessary action to protect the victim, and to prevent future violence. In this scenario, the frontline responders have identified the following risk factors and victim’s vulnerability factors:\n\nPeter is\n\n• using violence more frequently\n\n• using more intensive (harmful, injurious) violence\n\nPeter has\n\n• strangled Nora\n\n• used coercive control\n\n• used physical violence\n\n• used economic, digital and psychological violence\n\n• previous criminal record entries\n\nNora\n\n• is planning a divorce\n\n• has an immigrant background\n\nNora experiences\n\n• strong fear\n\n• social isolation\n\n• mental health issues\n\nThe community of Nora and Peter is justifying violence by\n\n• honour\n\nTask\n\nIn order to enable constructive and smooth co-operation between different agencies, the legislation should be clear and every partner should understand their roles and responsibilities.\n\n(1) Do you know, in which situation you can share and exchange information with other agencies?\n\nStep 3: Outlining necessary actions\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe learning objectives of this module are to become familiar with the safety planning, risk management and multi-agency cooperation.\n\nOutlining necessary actions is a phase where the frontline responders in close co-operation plan safety measures and take action to ensure the victim’s safety. Again, read first about Nora’s case. Then, look at the to do –list and read why a strong co-operation network is crucial.\n\nCase scenario: Nora\n\nComprehensive risk assessment should lead to effective risk management. Look at the boxes below: supporting a domestic violence victim sometimes requires help from several different agencies. All the agencies have their own role in supporting the victim. It is important to take legal actions and to support Nora’s well-being, in addition to her relationship with her mother and sisters. Nora needs support from her family members to be able to leave an abusive relationship.\n\nWhy do we need a strong co-operation network?\n\nEffective multi-sectoral and multi-agency interventions require that all policy sectors and actors are engaged and accountable, namely law enforcement, the judiciary, health, social welfare and child services, employment, education, and general and specialised services for victims. Extensive research and evaluation of existing co-ordinated interventions also demonstrate the importance of involving – in addition to sectoral stakeholders – autonomous victims’ rights advocates and other relevant NGOs working in the field of violence against women. Developing a shared understanding of violence against women, as well as improving information-sharing and risk assessment through the development of common standards, guidelines and protocols can greatly contribute toward the pooling of valuable resources and establishing systematic co-operation. Such tools are also instrumental in securing the active commitment of all stakeholders.\n\nTo do-list for frontline responders\n\nPolice\n\nInform the victim about shelters and guide the victim to a shelter if needed\n\nInitiate child protection procedures if not yet done\n\nFile a crime offence report if not yet done\n\nBy the victim’s consent, contact the victim support services\n\nDocument information produced by risk assessment and keep it confidential\n\nInform the victim about a restraining order or issue a temporary restraining order\n\nInform the victim of possible moments when the police is going to contact the perpetrator\n\nInform the victim when the perpetrator will be released from custody*\n\nCreate a safety plan for the victim\n\nIn case of physical injuries, guide the victim to health care services to have them treated and documented\n\nGuide the victim to social services based on her/his needs for support\n\nMake sure all relevant NGOs are invited to participate in the risk assessment process\n\nAssist the victim in protecting her/his personal data\n\nTake into account the risks of digitally assisted stalking and cyberstalking and help the victim in protecting their digital devices\n\nDepending on the legislation, the police can also consider secret means of gathering intelligence prevent crimes or avoid danger\n\nConsider the benefits of a portable alarm system for the victim\n\nAssist the perpetrator in joining a perpetrator programme*\n\n* = if this duty does not belong to an another agency\n\nSocial work\n\nIf there is an immediate or even likely risk to the safety of the client or any children, consider contacting the police\n\nInitiate child protection procedures if not yet done\n\nInform the victim about shelters and guide the victim to a shelter if needed\n\nHelp the victim to solve financial problems\n\nSecure safe housing for the victim\n\nAssist the victim in protecting her/his personal data\n\nAssist the victim in getting immediate crisis help and psychosocial support\n\nHealth care\n\nAlways examine the patient without their family members or spouse being present\n\nAssist the victim in receiving immediate crisis help and psychosocial support\n\nIf there is an immediate risk to safety of the patient or any children, consider contacting the police\n\nInitiate child protection procedures if not yet done\n\nAsk for victim’s consent before letting in any visitors\n\nStep 4: Follow-up\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe learning objectives of this module are to become familiar with the purpose of the follow-up phase and to understand the need for a dynamic risk assessment process.\n\nFollow-up is a phase, during which the frontline responder is in regular contact with the victim. Read first why we need the follow-up phase and then see what the follow-up looks like in Nora’s case.\n\nWhy do we need the follow-up phase as a part of the risk assessment process?\n\nDespite an effective intervention, an abuser may continue being violent and oppressive towards the victim. There are many reasons why a victim of domestic violence may not be able to leave the abuser: e.g., (mutual) dependency, fear or financial issues. Usually it takes several attempts to leave an abuser before staying away for good. Sometimes separation escalates the violence. The victim may try to control the violence by staying in the relationship. The victim may leave the abuser, but the abuser starts stalking and harassing the victim. Child contact arrangements may be used as way to carry on subjecting victims to violence. In a nutshell, the situation may get worse.\n\nIdeally, risk assessment is a dynamic process. Risk assessment needs to be regularly revised. If the threat of violence continues, the process of risk assessment needs to start over again. Effective prevention of domestic violence and breaking the cycle of violence may require several interventions.\n\nCase scenario: Nora\n\nA lot has happened since Nora’s first meeting with an NGO worker.\n\nNora currently stays in a shelter. She has a support person from the Victim Support Service as well as from an NGO that provides assistance for immigrant women who have faced violence. She also has regular meetings with a psychiatric nurse.\n\nPolice has filed a report of assaults, defamation, threatening and frauds committed by Peter. Nora has got a restraining order against Peter. Nora has learnt from her lawyer that divorce does not affect her immigration status.\n\nNora has a new bank account and a new secret phone number. She attends the language course in another school. Nora meets the NGO worker every week. The NGO worker has mediated the conflict between Nora and her mother and sisters successfully.\n\nEverything seems to be fine now, right?\n\nHowever, Nora is scared. She is terrified of the possibility that Peter will find her. A fear of death is taking over her life.\n\nWhen Nora lived with Peter, she felt that she was able to control her fear. She was able to sense Peter’s agitation and she always did everything to avoid an explosion. She pleased Peter and tried to reason with him. She felt how the tension was building and when the violence began, she felt relief: ‘Soon this is going to be over for some weeks. Soon I can breathe again’.\n\nTraumatising experiences make Nora doubt and blame herself.\n\nThe NGO worker and the psychiatric nurse always ask about Nora’s fear, but she cannot tell them. She feels overwhelming shame to admit to her helpers that, despite all the help and support she has received, she is terrified. Living with an abusive partner was easier when she did not have to be frightened all the time. She cannot reveal these thoughts to anyone.\n\nNora becomes even more confused when she meets a friend of Peter by chance. The friend tells that Peter is sad and upset. The friend says that Peter has been extremely worried about Nora and has tried to find her.\n\n‘He is not doing very well.’\n\n‘Please call him.’\n\n…\n\nThe human mind is complex. What could happen next in Nora’s case? What if Nora calls Peter? Will Peter find Nora or will Nora return to Peter? What if Nora tells about this incident in the next meeting with the NGO worker?\n\nMonitoring the situation and keeping a trustful and safe relationship with the victim are extremely important. Here, Nora discloses to the NGO worker how she is worried about Peter’s condition. This leads to a discussion of Nora’s fears and self-blame. The NGO worker pays attention to the message that Peter has been trying to find Nora.\n\nIf Nora’s situation changed, the frontline responders would revise the risk assessment and take new appropriate measures. For example, depending on the legislation, the police can consider secret means of gathering intelligence to prevent crimes or avoid danger. A portable alarm system could ease the fear Nora is experiencing. There are many options.\n\nThank you for reading Nora’s story.\n\nLearn more about domestic violence risk assessment from the Good-read section.

Good practice examples\n\nIn the eight countries IMPRODOVA took place, we identified different good practice examples regarding inter-agency cooperation that we want to introduce to you.\n\nThe cross-referenced analysis of 18 case studies in the IMPRODOVA countries lets us conclude five organisational features that were found in “all good partnership practices” against domestic violence. This should not suggest that it would be sufficient to set up the “right organisation”, i.e., an organisational structure that displays these five characteristics, to generate dynamic, productive and sustainable inter-institutional cooperation.\n\nThe analysis of the 18 case studies shows that the consolidation of a partnership against domestic violence depends on many factors that have nothing to do with the partnership organisations’ design and management. By consolidation, we address the institutionalisation and systematic use of working procedures by which partnership bodies and partnership relays contribute together and in an integrated manner to provide efficient partnership services.\n\nThese factors include:\n\nthe existence of a legal framework or public policy that encourages or even enforces partner organisations to engage in the partnership and consider it a priority. These incentives can be negative (regulatory obligation, hierarchical order, etc.) or positive (granting of subsidies, allocation of additional resources, etc.);\n\nincreased social, political and media pressure to strengthen the war on domestic violence. These pressures are often linked to public opinion cases, advocacy, or the adoption of international standards;\n\nstrong involvement of institutional entrepreneurs and change agents in the design and promotion of the partnership mechanism, and their ability to build alliances with members of influential partner organisations;\n\nsecuring political support, especially from local authorities;\n\nreference to models applied elsewhere – on the national territory or abroad – that are already acknowledged as “good practices”. Such recognition is rarely linked to the availability of rigorous evaluations of “good practice” effectiveness. It most often results from the notoriety of the institutions that have pioneered the practice or are working to disseminate it.\n\nBelow, you may find detailed information about the good practices. To get more information about our research results, you may download our report:\n\nNational Crisis Telephone (Hungary)\n\nThe National Crisis Management and Information Telephone Service (OKIT) was launched in 2005, based on the findings and experiences of a pilot program related to a hotline focusing on domestic violence. At that time, mental health professionals, psychologists, social workers, social pedagogues, and experts in social policy took part in a complex training program and joined the team of counsellors.\n\nOKIT aims to respond to this situation: it helps victims of domestic violence and human trafficking through a telephone line available free of charge, non-stop throughout the country. Trained domestic violence counsellors (operating two lines 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with an additional line on workdays between 8 am and 4 pm when the service receives the most calls) primarily provide counselling and information about available victim support services. In addition, they refer victims leaving their homes and escaping the abusers to shelters which OKIT closely cooperates with. A risk assessment tool supports the counsellors in assessing crisis situations and making decisions about the adequate response. No physical evidence is required to support a client’s case. The organisation can offer a low-threshold service targeted to the complex needs of DV victims and thereby decrease latency.\n\nThe telephone service staff is made up of qualified helping professionals with many years of experience in the field. Staff receive internal training during the induction period as well as taking part in regular training events to improve their work. Colleagues regularly get supervision in a group setting, but individual supervision sessions are also available. Apart from this, the staff have regular meetings during which they discuss cases. OKIT is part of the Crisis Management Network (which also includes, crisis shelters, crisis clinics and secret safe shelters), the network members often meet up for workshops, training events and conferences, where new issues, trends, challenges, and developments are discussed to share goods practices, thinking together, and improving the services for clients. As a telephone service, OKIT also takes part in training events led by experts at other telephone support services.\n\nOKIT has initiated a chat service as well, for victims of domestic violence, child abuse and human trafficking, who have difficulties acquiring help quickly via other channels. The website of OKIT has undergone further developments in recent years: it now has information in multiple languages and the accessibility of the website has also been improved.\n\nLiving Free of violence (Austria)\n\nLiving FREE of violence is a campaign to prevent violence against women and children founded in 2014. “Living FREE of Violence” (GewaltFREI leben) is coordinated by the Federal Ministry for Education and Women’s Affairs and implemented by the association “Autonomous Austrian Women’s Shelters” (Verein Autonome Österreichische Frauenhäuser, AÖF) in cooperation with the Vienna Intervention Center against Violence in the Family (Wiener Interventionsstelle gegen Gewalt in der Familie) and the Austrian National Youth Council (Bundesjugendvertretung). In the years 2014 and 2015, numerous projects aiming at awareness-raising for the issue of violence against women and children and providing valuable prevention work will be implemented.“\n\nTheir homepage provides a broad range of information on domestic violence as well as training material and guidelines for practitioners.\n\nAnchor Team (Finland)\n\nWhat is an Anchor team?\n\nIn Finland there are multi-agency teams (“Anchor teams”) working in several police departments. Anchor teams consist of police officers, social workers, and psychiatric nurses. Anchor teams vary in terms of composition in different locations.\n\nThe multi-agency cooperation and the exchange of information between the police, social services and health care, which is the core of the Anchor method, are based on an agreement between the police and the city (note: municipalities have a duty to provide social and health care services, also in situations of domestic violence).\n\nThe Anchor (“Ankkuri”) model supports the wellbeing of children and adolescents and is geared towards the prevention of juvenile delinquency and crime, violent radicalisation and extremism. In some places, like in case location 1, the Anchor model is also used to prevent domestic and intimate partner violence by intervening in incidents at the earliest possible stage and by referring the parties involved to relevant support services.\n\nThe Anchor model is based on multi-agency cooperation, which involves different public authorities working together at police stations. An Anchor team may consist of a police officer, two social workers, a social advisor, a psychiatric nurse, and a youth worker. The social workers, the social advisor, the youth worker, and the nurse are municipal employees. The staff cooperates closely as a team, each bringing their own professional competence and the support and expertise of their own background organisation to the team.\n\nMultidisciplinary cooperation makes it possible for professionals to serve the customer in a holistic manner based on a ‘one-stop shop’ principle. While the police officer from the investigation unit investigates the crime, the Anchor team’s health care and social work professionals look into the overall circumstances of the customer and his/her family. The Anchor team’s social workers and nurse assess the needs of the customer and refer him/her to further services such as victim support services, shelter services, NGOs working against domestic violence, mental health services etc. The benefits of this holistic approach and multi-agency cooperation are evident in challenging situations where the customer suffers from multiple problems like domestic violence, substance addiction and mental disorder.\n\nEffective victim identification and detection\n\nThe involvement of handling domestic violence depends on the particular police station. Some of the anchor teams are very active in identification of domestic violence victims. The following case example describes the outreach work of an Anchor team.\n\nThe police officer of the Anchor team goes over all the local emergency reports two times per week and searches for expressions that indicate conflicts between couples, disturbing behaviour, mischief, or disorder. For example, an emergency report may be categorised as “disturbing behaviour” in the situation where there has been a noisy person in the corridor, but in reality, this person can be a person who has escaped to the corridor from her violent spouse. The police officer selects all the reports that refer to conflicts or arguments and collects these reports to generate an observation that is more precise.\n\nAfter selection, the police officer tries to identify the persons from the emergency reports. The aim is to identify persons who associate with the reports by using different registers. After identification, the police officer collects data about the person’s living conditions, for example information about children and people living at the same address.\n\nThe Anchor team meets regularly. In the meeting, all of the selected, identified cases are presented to the social worker, the social advisor, and the psychiatric nurse. The police officer examines if the person has previously been in contact with the police. The social worker examines, among other things, if the family is a client of the child welfare service. The psychiatric nurse examines, for instance, if the medical reports give any information about mental disorders of the family’s children. This way, the Anchor team pieces together a huge amount of information about the family even before the family is contacted. The information exchange is easiest when the customer has children because the cooperation can be justified by the child’s interests without asking the customers to give her or his assent.\n\nThe family is contacted by the psychiatric nurse. The team has noticed that people are keener to speak about their life circumstances and potential domestic violence they experience, when they are contacted by the nurse of the multi-agency team. Similarly, people are not very responsive if they get a phone call from a police officer or a social worker who is associated to work for the child protection service.\n\nAfter the psychiatric nurse has contacted a family or a couple, it often becomes clear that there actually have been violent conflicts in the family. In some cases, the police patrol has been on the spot solving the conflict but concluded that no violence has occurred, even though the family has actually suffered from domestic violence for a longer period of time.\n\nCooperation with other police units\n\nDetective senior constables and detective sergeants of a Crime Investigation Unit consult the Anchor team members at the police department. The investigator can convince the victim or the perpetrator to meet the social worker or the psychiatric nurse of the Anchor team. Sometimes, with the permission of the person being questioned, the investigator asks the nurse or the social worker to attend the hearing as a role of a hearing witness. In the first place, the task of a hearing witness is to follow the hearing and make sure that no unappropriate methods are being used. When the hearing witness is the psychiatric nurse or the social worker of the Anchor team, they can hear the victim’s or perpetrator’s story as such. After the hearing is finished, they can start assisting the client without asking him/her to explain the circumstances all over again. In addition, the Anchor team may guide the victim to the Unit of Violence Work, shelters for victims of domestic violence, MARAC group or pass the information to the victim’s own social worker.\n\nCooperation with other professionals\n\nThe Anchor team will inform customers about the relevant services and tries to create bridges to other services and professionals. The Anchor team’s social worker cooperates with the municipality’s child welfare services and the psychiatric nurse has contacts to health sector professionals in addition to MARAC group professionals. In an individual process with the customer, it is decided which services are needed and would support the clients. Mainly meetings are organised in the police department but, for example if the customer is accommodated in a shelter, the psychiatric nurse and social worker can visit there.\n\nThe idea behind the Anchor teams is to prevent domestic violence by intervening at the violence’s earliest possible stage and guide customers to relevant services. Perpetrators are often informed about the local NGO’s services working against domestic violence (Unit of Violence Work). Victims are referred to MARAC groups, shelter services, psychiatrics, victim support services, and also to NGO services and other necessary services that are available in the area (some customers are ready to receive NGO services even from different cities, like from the capital area or other bigger cities).\n\nAnchor team management\n\nSecrecy of personal information is the main cause that limits the effective exchange of information between the authorities. The core of Anchor work – multi-professional cooperation and exchange of information between the police, social work, and health care – is based on an agreement between the police and the municipality. If the customer gives her/his consent, the Anchor team shares information with the police as well as social and health care authorities. Information sharing is easiest and most effective when the customer has a child. In such a situation, the cooperation can be justified by the interests of the child and the cooperation does not necessarily require the customer’s consent. Childless couples are losers in this system if they do not want to receive help from the multi-professional team.\n\nSome limitations within the work of the Anchor team are related to turnover of personnel. The work of the Anchor team is highly independent and self-guided albeit the core is based on teamwork with other authorities. This kind of working environment demands the employees to be open-minded, committed, collaborative, dependable and communicative.\n\nIstanbul Convention and multi-agency cooperation\n\nThe Istanbul Convention, article 18, orders the parties to take the necessary legislative or other measures in accordance with internal law, to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms to provide for effective co‐operation between all relevant state agencies. This includes the judiciary, public prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, local and regional authorities as well as non‐governmental organisations and other relevant organisations and entities. They are supposed to protect and support victims and witnesses of all forms of violence as covered by the scope of this Convention, this includes referring victims to general and specialist support services as detailed in Articles 20 and 22 of the Istanbul Convention. Multi-agency methods like Anchor teams and MARAC groups are means that increase this kind of cooperation between different agencies.\n\nDomestic Violence Investigation Team (Finland)\n\nDomestic violence-specialised investigation team\n\nAn investigation team that is specialised on domestic violence has got several positive outcomes. Specialising in one particular type of crime has produced highly skilled personnel and offered a possibility for motivated and emphatic people to apply for a job in the domestic violence investigation team. Inversely, police officers who are not motivated to investigate domestic violence cases are not forced to do so which lowers the possibility of secondary victimisation – for example in a situation where the victim blamed for the violence or would be treated without respect.\n\nDue to the nature of domestic violence, its investigation demands highly skilled personnel with empathy, motivation, and commitment. The goal of the specialised team is to investigate the crime but also to find special support for the victims who are in a constant dependent or subordinate relationship to the suspect. A preliminary investigation of a domestic violence case means sometimes several long questionings, but the investigator needs to understand things like psychological response to trauma and victimisation. After the questioning is finished, the investigator tries to motivate a victim or a perpetrator to receive assistance. The detective senior constables and detective sergeants have to know how to approach a victim and a suspect to build trust, to motivate the person to talk about his/her situation and to motivate them to get help. This all takes more time than an average hearing in police work. The daily routine where a police officer focuses on one type of crime, and is not distracted by “easier” cases like thefts and forgeries, helps to achieve an environment where domestic violence cases are not skipped as more demanding or onerous tasks.\n\nAllowing the personnel to specialise in domestic violence and feeding their motivation also generates subspecialisation. The supervisors in the domestic violence investigation team are motivated to develop the work among vulnerable groups. Specialisation has also made an effective service counselling possible. The Domestic Violence Investigation Unit has good connections to different governmental and non-governmental services. The employees have personally visited many of the cooperation partners. Knowing stakeholders personally and to be able to talk about their work diversely is an effective tool in motivating clients to receive help.\n\nIstanbul Convention and domestic violence-specialised investigation teams\n\nThe specialisation in the Domestic Violence Investigation Unit has created many qualities that fulfil the guidelines of the Istanbul Convention. The skilled and motivated personnel meet the victims in a sensitive way to prevent repeated victimisation. The victim is asked if she/he wants to be informed when the perpetrator is about to be released from custody. All the victims are informed of their rights and the services at their disposal and the follow-up given to their complaint, the charges, the general progress of the investigation and their role therein. The victim is always asked to give her/his consent to pass the contact information to the Victim Support Finland and all the victims and perpetrators are asked to give their consent to pass contact information to the local Assistance Service for Domestic Violence.\n\nThe specialisation of Domestic Violence Investigation Units grants better protection of the victims, better information sharing, trust and knowledge of one another between partners, better problem solving capacity and better ability to take account of the particularities of each individual victim. The sub-specialisation within the team enables broader understanding of different phenomena like forced marriage and honour-related violence. Once, these sub-specialisation skills are acknowledged and seen as part of the organisation’s structure, they become part of the organisational memory and they are not bound to individuals anymore.\n\nBerlin Initiative against violence towards women (BIG e.V., Germany)\n\nThe ‘Berlin Initiative against violence towards women’ (in the following: BIG), founded in 1993, commits itself to improving the living conditions of women affected by domestic violence, including their children. BIG works to create social and professional conditions in the field of frontline response to domestic violence that reduce the incidences of domestic violence and provide better protection and appropriate support to those affected by domestic violence. This includes strengthening the rights of the victims and ensuring that abusive men are held responsible for their actions. Only if practices are improved in all relevant areas, this deems possible and sustainable. Thus, in order to carry out this work, a multi-professional, well-connected and active network and collaborative approach as the one of BIG is needed.\n\nBIG involves three work units: BIG Coordination, BIG Hotline and BIG Prevention.\n\nBIG Coordination establishes inter-organisational collaboration by involving all relevant professional groups and societal forces involved in domestic violence and by creating efficient cooperation structures for them.\n\nFocussing on the three groups involved in domestic violence (victims, children, and perpetrators), BIG Coordination analyses practices or gaps to then develop or improve practices, which enhance and increase the protection of victims. Its working methods aim to firstly identify weaknesses and gaps in practice through feedback from victims and the cooperation network. Identified problems relate, for example, to difficulties with authorities or in collaborations, tough procedures, lack of offers for certain target groups, gaps in the law, etc. BIG Coordination then invites the relevant experts for a problem to jointly develop solutions that hopefully can be implemented in practice.\n\nThe cooperation network of BIG Coordination\n\nBIG Coordination has an extremely large and diversified cooperation network, in which all relevant stakeholders of different professions and institutions take part.\n\nPsycho-social sector: all counselling and intervention centres, projects, and initiatives in the context of domestic violence and related fields, all women’s houses and shelters in Berlin as well as numerous others in Germany, asylum accommodations, Job Centres and many more\n\nSector of child and youth welfare: in particular youth welfare offices, the children’s emergency service, girls’ emergency service and, for example, a children’s theatre\n\nHealth sector: hospitals, trauma clinics, the Berlin Outpatient Clinic for the Protection against Violence to document the injuries, and S.i.g.n.a.l., another coordination NGO in Berlin, specialised on interventions in the health sector in the case of sexualised and domestic violence\n\nExecutive: officers of the Berlin Police on various levels from base to headquarters\n\nSector of justice: lawyers, district and public prosecutors, family courts\n\nEducational sector: schools and other educational institutions, including universities\n\nPolitical sector: all relevant senate administrations and federal ministries, the State Commission against Violence, integration commissioners of the Berlin Senate, equal opportunities commissioners of the districts\n\nMeasures of work\n\nWork groups often only convene for a very specific question or dilemma. An example of such a practice is an expert group dealing with risk assessment and case conferences.\n\nIn contrast to the work groups formed on a transitional basis only, there also exists a number of regular round tables. The aim is to exchange information on current developments, requirements and challenges related with police work.\n\nOutputs of inter-organisational collaborations\n\nThe following small selection of outputs of this system of collaborative action coordinated by BIG Coordination illustrates achievements at the legislative and police level.\n\nThe Protection Act against Violence (Gewaltschutzgesetz 2002) is based on an initiative of BIG Coordination.\n\nThe Berlin definition of Domestic Violence (2001) has been valid for almost two decades. It is postulated that in the Berlin Police force, every police officer who works in this context is familiar with it. During a time, in which many uncertainties of action in police operations of domestic violence still existed, in which such incidents were treated simply as “family disputes”, this definition made it possible to clearly categorise this form of violence, to compile meaningful statistics and to be able to describe and approach the phenomenon as such. However, with the implementation of the Istanbul Convention (2012), the dilemma aroused that the Berlin definition of domestic violence does not correspond to the one of the EU. The EU definition refers to intra-family violence, which can contain all kinds of violent crimes and not just domestic violence. Nowadays, cases must be counted nationwide according to the EU definition. Nevertheless, the Berlin definition is considered, as the police statistics of Berlin and the Federal Government additionally count violence in partnership. However, the presentation of homicides or other more specific forms of violence has become more difficult.\n\nPolice action in cases of domestic violence includes a proactive approach. This is also incorporated in the police quality standards. The intention is to make it easier for the victims to access suitable support services: with the consent of the victim, the Berlin Police pass on the contact details to the BIG Hotline and a counsellor contacts the woman by phone within a short period of time.\n\nParticularly in the field of education and training, a great deal has been achieved through BIG Coordination, which also offers training and information events. This is important – after all, continuing education is an effective measure to consolidate the achieved results in practice.\n\nHAIP Network (Hanover’s Intervention Program against Domestic Violence, Germany)\n\nIn 1992, the round table against male violence in the family was launched. It developed the Hanoverian intervention project against male violence in the family: HAIP. In 1997, HAIP was officially implemented with a corresponding order from the police chief and has since then been working successfully as an interdisciplinary networked program.\n\nIn 1997, the HAIP network was developed by the “Round Table against male violence within a family” (founded in 1992) and it was established in 1997, even before the Protection Against Violence Act was established in Germany, as an attempt to structure the work against domestic violence.\n\nGoals of HAIP\n\nProvide extensive protection, assistance, and support to those affected by domestic violence.\n\nHold perpetrators accountable and achieve their accountability and behavioural change.\n\nReduce domestic violence through reasonably networked intervention of all those involved, and ensure sustainable long-term support, counselling, and intervention.\n\nPrevention, information, and public relations work.\n\nTake a public stand against domestic violence and on gender justice and work towards social developments and necessities.\n\nAltogether to fight domestic violence, HAIP aims to provide a proactive, fast response towards victims and perpetrators of domestic violence.\n\nRound Table\n\nThe largest body is the “Round Table” taking place twice a year. Members and HAIP committees inform each other about their work and activities, which are done according to the purpose of the Round Table. They make decisions about the work of HAIP including decisions that go into politics, develop opinions on current topics and accordingly distribute work orders to the HAIP committees. About 40 different institutions are part of this, including women protection shelters, the youth welfare office, the equal opportunities office, the medical network, different counselling centres, prosecutors, judges, the police, and representatives of all political factions in the city council.\n\nBuilding Blocks\n\nThe center or heart of the HAIP is the committee that deals with actual cases, the eleven “Building Blocks” (Bausteine). They work independently and e. g., conduct case discussions especially on cases with high risk assessments. Additionally, orders and topics of the round table as well as own questions, case presentations etc. are processed there. Moreover, Building Blocks participate in HAIP’s public relations work and organise specialist courses, lectures, training, and seminars.\n\nThe eleven Building Blocks are:\n\nCoordination Unit “BISS”,\n\nWomen and Children Protection Shelter,\n\nProsecution Hanover,\n\nPolice Hanover,\n\nYouth Welfare Office “Waage e.V.” (counselling for perpetrator-victim-agreements),\n\nMen’s Office Hanover e.V.,\n\nEmpowerment Office (“Bestärkungsstelle”, counselling for female victims),\n\n“SUANA” (counselling for migrant women),\n\nManagerial Director of the HAIP office,\n\nEqual Opportunities Officer.\n\nThe coordination office, special working groups and the coordination unit “BISS” are further parts of the network.\n\nGAIV (Gabinete de Atendimento e Informação a Vítimas da PSP-Porto, Portugal)\n\nPSP-Porto Victims’ Support and Information Cabinet (Gabinete de Atendimento e Informação a Vítimas da PSP-Porto; GAIV) operates in the city of Porto and has 17 police officers on an exclusive basis: they deal with cases of domestic violence, 24/7, in a confidential and specialised way. Between 2010 and 2014, 725 citizens were arrested for domestic violence in the city of Porto alone. About 3,000 victims were followed, 1,200 individual security plans and 1,600 risk assessments were carried out in the last year.\n\nGAIV manages all the domestic violence-related calls in the city. GAIV has become the domestic violence pivotal frontline responder in the city. In the backstage, PSP creates the Crime Investigation Special Teams for domestic violence (Equipas Especiais de Violência Doméstica; EEIV) which are specialised in the criminal investigation of these crimes. This new arrangement allowed the PSP to obtain a high level of public awareness regarding domestic violence.\n\nAligning with the IMPRODOVA conceptual framework, the Porto experience merges an organisational arrangement from the part of PSP, involving intra-organisational cooperation (GAIV and other police units), with inter-organisational cooperation between the police, several NGOs, health services, and public prosecutor services. These arrangements aim to clarify the limits of the problem at hand, goals and stakes, resources and actors involved.\n\nAs mentioned, GAIV emerged as a focal service to attend domestic violence victims and follow-up their cases, control the use of the teleassistance devices (if triggered, police officers are deployed to attend to the victim), and react promptly in case of emergency. In principle, all domestic violence cases in Porto would be dealt with in GAIV. For that purpose, PSP choose a new police facility – Esquadra do Bom Pastor, Bom Pastor Police Station – which was built considering modern technical recommendations, such as friendly interior, among other physical and functional attributes supporting the specific work with victims (e.g., attendance rooms, learning and training rooms, spaces for children, separation between victims and offenders when inside the station). Also, GAIV had the chance to gather specialised personnel working exclusively with domestic violence matters.\n\nTherefore, this new response was able to remove pressure from the system and to increase the quality of service regarding domestic violence victims.\n\nEspaço Júlia – RIAV (Integrated Victim Support Response, Portugal)\n\n25 September 2011: officer João Sousa Dias is on duty when he receives a call from a man reporting a death in a house located two minutes away from the police station. Without wasting time, he goes to the house targeted and is the first officer to witness the crime of domestic violence. Her husband, with whom she had been living for 30 years, murdered Julia, a 77-year-old woman, following a breakfast argument. He himself contacted the police and identified himself as a murderer.\n\nJoão Sousa Dias says he never forgot the scenario he witnessed. A crime without any alert issued to the police before, but that the neighbourhood had some knowledge about: “I asked the neighbours about Júlia. They all told me she was an excellent lady. But when I asked them about the couple’s relationship, they shrugged their shoulders, manifesting that ‘between husband and wife, you don’t pick'”.\n\nJúlia’s episode marked the whole population around her. And now, there is one before and after Júlia. RIAV was founded in 2015, thanks to the will and initiative of the Santo António Parish Council, with the Lisbon Metropolitan Command of the Public Security Police and the Central Lisbon Hospital Centre.\n\nThe Júlia Space, in honour of Júlia, is on the same street as the house where the elderly woman lived and was designed to provide an integrated response to victims of domestic violence. A response that is lacking in many police stations in the country is here: to support and accompany the victims of domestic violence: 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, with specialised technicians.\n\nIn the Espaço Júlia, 10 agents from the PSP work – 5 male agents and 5 female agents with training in the area of domestic violence and victim care. There is also the signatory (Head of the PSP and Trainer of the PSP in the area of domestic violence), and there are two technicians of Victim Support from the Santo António Parish Council (with TAV training from the Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality), which includes the Technical Director of the Espaço Júlia, Inês Carrolo.\n\nSince July 2015, the opening date of the Espaço Júlia, 1573 complaints have been received. In 2019 alone 285 complaints have been received – most of them (224) from women between the ages of 25 and 44, and there is still a certain percentage of those under 18 (10 complaints in 2019).\n\n“The occurrences of the Espaço Júlia, as a rule, are complex and sensitive, since they involve especially vulnerable victims of various ages, from various social strata. The most complicated occurrences are those involving sexual abuse and rape of children, not only because of the nature of the crime, but also because of the technical procedures and police measures that need to be taken urgently”, the Space’s officials say.\n\nAll cases of domestic violence, rape, and sexual abuse are conducted at the Espaço Júlia, which is signalled by the health units of the Dona Estefânia Hospital’s Paediatric Emergency Department and the São José Hospital’s Emergency Department. “However, any person who goes to this space will be attended. If necessary, the victim will be taken to a safe place, managed by entities with which we have partnerships”, adds the Santo António Parish Council.\n\nSources"
