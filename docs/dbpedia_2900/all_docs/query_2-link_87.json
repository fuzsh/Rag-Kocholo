        "text": "05/12/2023: Lauterbach calls for more people to get Covid vaccines\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has called for caution and more vaccinations during Advent in the face of a wave of Covid infections. He said the disease “wasn’t just a cold”. Lauterbach appealed to people aged over 60 and other high-risk groups, adding that getting vaccinated now would be “the ideal time” for it to take full effect in time for Christmas. So far only 3 million people have been vaccinated with the recommended new vaccines which have been adapted to the current virus variants, Lauterbach said, stressing that the figure was too low.\n\n+++\n\n29/11/2023: Phone-based doctor’s notes system reintroduced\n\nBerlin (d.de) The system under which workers can request a doctor’s note over the phone without having to see a doctor in person is to be reintroduced from 7 December 2023, according to information from the ARD’s Tagesschau news programme. It is to be reintroduced on a permanent, rather than only temporary basis. During the Covid-19 pandemic workers were allowed to request doctor’s notes over the phone, but only in cases of mild respiratory infections. In future the system is to cover all diseases which are “not predicted to develop into serious illness”, Tagesschau reports. However, patients must be known to the medical practice, and the practice must check the caller’s identity. In Germany all employees require a doctor’s note to take sick leave from work, which they must present to their employers. The doctor’s note does not state the diagnosis but does indicate how long the doctor expects the worker to be signed off for sickness.\n\n+++\n\n02/10/2023: Nobel Prize in Medicine for BioNTech adviser Katalin Karikó\n\nStockholm/Berlin (dpa) – For their fundamental work on mRNA vaccines against Covid-19, the Hungarian-born researcher Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman from the USA have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. “Through their groundbreaking findings, which have fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system, the laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times,” explained the Nobel Prize Committee.\n\nThe coronavirus vaccines made by the Mainz-based firm BioNTech and the US company Moderna were the first two mRNA products to be placed on the market. In 2013 Karikó had met Uğur Şahin, who founded BioNTech together with his wife Özlem Türeci. As Karikó told the “New York Times”, he offered her a job that same day. She left the company after working there for years, and since October 2022 has continued to serve it in an advisory capacity.\n\n+++\n\n29/09/2023: Specialist pandemic preparedness conference in Berlin\n\nBerlin (d.de) At the invitation of Federal Development Minister Schulze and Federal Health Minister Lauterbach, high-ranking representatives from politics, international organisations, civil society, academia, science and the private sector assembled in Berlin for “Pandemics - no time for neglect” to discuss pandemic prevention. The conference focused on how to avert future pandemics. Federal Development Minister Svenja Schulze said, “Viruses know no borders. We can only protect ourselves from pandemics if we think and act globally, recognising that the risks remain undiminished.”\n\nFederal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said, “The Covid-19 pandemic laid bare the gaps in global pandemic prevention and preparedness.” In response to this, a Pandemic Fund held by the World Bank has been created with a particular focus on supporting developing countries to improve pandemic prevention, preparedness and responses. So far Germany has pledged €199m to the fund, making it the third-largest donor. Germany is also supporting the expansion of local vaccine and pharmaceutical production in Africa with donations so far amounting to €550m. It is also explicitly supporting the goal of the African Union to produce 60% of the vaccines Africa needs in Africa by 2040.\n\n+++\n\n21/09/2023: Number of Covid-19 cases rising in Germany\n\nBerlin (dpa) – As expected, the number of Covid-19 cases in Germany is rising. A newly updated vaccine is available from medical practices, said Markus Beier, Chair of the Association of General Practitioners. He added that while there was demand for the vaccine, there was “scope for that to rise”, and stressed the need to advise more patients on the subject. At the same time, the association of GPs has called for at-risk groups such as the over-60s to get vaccinated against flu, citing a fear of very high numbers of cases if vaccine acceptance proves to be low due to a prevailing “vaccine weariness” in the population.\n\n+++\n\n26.08.2022: Biontech to deliver adapted Corona vaccine soon\n\nMainz (dpa) - Biontech wants to deliver its Corona vaccine, adapted from the Omikron variant, within a few days after the approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is expected soon. \"We can deliver very promptly, hopefully from the beginning of September,\" company boss Ugur Sahin told Der Spiegel. The EMA had recently announced that the competent committee would decide on 1 September on the applications of Biontech/Pfizer and the US company Moderna for approval of their vaccine adapted to subtype BA.1. In the meantime, this variant no longer plays a role in Germany. The hope is that this vaccine will also be more effective against the variants currently circulating. The EMA is also currently examining a Corona vaccine adapted to the current Omikron variants BA.4 and BA.5 from the Mainz-based company and its US partner Pfizer. Biontech is currently submitting the final documents to the EMA, Sahin told Der Spiegel: \"Then it can happen quickly here, too\".\n\n+++\n\n25.08.2022: Corona autumn rules on the way\n\nBerlin (dpa) - After only a few Corona requirements in the summer, stricter regulations on pandemic protection are approaching again for the autumn. The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday launched a draft that provides for more far-reaching rules on masks and tests from 1 October to 7 April 2023. The Länder are to be able to impose them and extend them in the event of a critical situation. Nationwide, FFP2 masks are to be mandatory in aeroplanes and long-distance trains, nursing homes and clinics.\n\n+++\n\n04.08.2022: Possible comeback of compulsory masks\n\nBerlin (dpa) - To protect against an autumn corona wave, mandatory masks are to be possible again in shops or authorities from October. The decision on this is to be made by the federal states themselves for their respective areas. This is provided for in a draft for the Infection Protection Act, as Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) and Federal Justice Minister Marco Buschmann (FDP) jointly announced. \"Masks protect\", Buschmann emphasised. In certain situations, it is therefore reasonable to require masks.\n\n+++\n\n24.07.2022: Groundbreaking ceremony for first Biontech production facility in Africa\n\nKigali (dpa) - The biopharmaceutical company Biontech began construction of the first production facility for mRNA-based vaccines in Africa on Thursday with a groundbreaking ceremony in the Rwandan capital Kigali. The first containers for production, known as \"BioNTainers\", are to be delivered to the site at the end of 2022, a company spokeswoman reported. Production of vaccines is expected to begin about 12 to 18 months after installation, it said. \"The goal we are pursuing with governments and regulatory agencies is to produce vaccines for Africa here with highly skilled professionals from Africa,\" Biontech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin said. Biontech is planning further production facilities in Senegal and South Africa. All vaccines produced in this network are reportedly intended for people in African Union countries. The selection of vaccines to be produced will be tailored to the needs of African Union member states, it said. In addition to the Covid 19 vaccine, these could include malaria and tuberculosis vaccines if development is successful. The company estimates that up to 50 million doses of Pfizer-Biontech's Covid-19 vaccine can be produced initially.\n\n+++\n\n15.07.2022: Lauterbach recommends fourth vaccination also for under 60s\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach recommends that people under the age of 60 also get a fourth Corona vaccination after consulting their doctor. If one wants to enjoy the summer without the risk of contracting the disease, then \"in consultation with the family doctor, of course, he would also recommend the vaccination to younger people\", the SPD politician told \"Der Spiegel\". With the second booster vaccination, there is \"a completely different level of safety\". It significantly reduces the risk of infection for a few months. The risk of contracting long covid is also significantly lower.\n\n+++\n\n12.07.2022: House of History: Collection on the pandemic completed\n\nBonn (dpa) - The House of History in Bonn has now largely completed its collection on the Corona crisis. More than two years after the beginning of the pandemic, about 1500 objects have been collected, said a spokesperson. If there are still serious new developments in the future, these will be taken up, but otherwise all areas of the topic are covered with the collected objects. With the collection, the museum wants to preserve this \"formative contemporary historical event\" as part of the cultural memory. Among the objects are breathing masks, vaccination vials, official forms and children's drawings. There are prohibition signs, for example concerning a \"no-dwelling zone\" in Düsseldorf, but also protest posters from opponents of the Corona measures. A beer wreath from a carnival meeting in the Heinsberg district symbolises the beginning of the pandemic in Germany and the original ball bears witness to the first ghost match of the German Football League.\n\n+++\n\n17.06.2022: Seven-point plan for autumn\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has called for caution in view of the renewed increase in the number of Corona infections and is preparing a protection plan for the autumn. A vaccination campaign with different vaccines is to be part of a seven-point plan. The aim is to close vaccination gaps in a targeted manner, said Lauterbach. In addition, a concept is to be developed to improve the use of medication for patients.\n\n+++\n\n09.06.2022: Expert Council: Rising infection figures in autumn\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The German government’s Coronavirus Expert Council recommends creating a legal basis to allow rapid responses to possible rising infection figures in the autumn and winter. The experts expect rising Covid infections in the autumn and winter to pose a considerable burden once again on Germany’s healthcare system and on key infrastructure for the population and the state. The advisory body, which has been working on behalf of the federal and state governments since December, has now presented its eleventh assessment.\n\n+++\n\n25.05.2022: Corona entry rules to be relaxed as of 1 June\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In view of falling corona case numbers, Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach wants to relax the rules for entering Germany over the summer months. \"Until the end of August, we will suspend the 3G rule on entry,\" the SPD politician told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe. From 1 June onwards, travellers returning to Germany and other immigrants will no longer have to prove that they have been vaccinated, have recovered or have been tested. The currently valid Corona Entry Ordinance still requires 3G proof for all persons over the age of twelve until 31 May.\n\n+++\n\n20.05.2022: G7 health ministers want to strengthen pandemic early warning systems\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The seven leading democratic industrialised nations are pushing for a more powerful fight against future pandemics. The aim is to detect outbreaks more quickly and react more effectively, the health ministers of the G7 countries decided in Berlin on Friday. A \"pandemic pact\" drawn up by them provides for stronger early warning systems, among other things. Networks of experts would have to be set up worldwide. An early warning centre of the World Health Organisation (WHO), which was established in Berlin last year, should also be used as a hub. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (photo), as host, said that the current crises showed how important it was to join forces.\n\n+++\n\n13.05.2022: Germany gives 50 million euros for new pandemic fund\n\nWashington (dpa) - Germany plans to contribute millions to a new World Bank pandemic preparedness fund in the fight against the Corona pandemic. \"I am pleased to announce today that Germany will initially contribute 50 million euros, subject to parliamentary approval,\" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the launch of an international online summit on the Corona pandemic on Thursday. It is the second virtual Corona Summit of this kind. The US government had convened a first summit last year. In addition to the USA, Germany and other countries are co-chairs at the online meeting. Germany currently holds the G7 presidency and will host the summit of the Group of Seven major democratic industrialised countries (G7) at the end of June.\n\n+++\n\n10.05.2022: Germany tourism picks up again after pandemic\n\nWiesbaden (dpa) - German tourism is increasingly working its way out of the Corona low after the end of the restrictions. The number of overnight stays by travellers in hotels, guesthouses and the like rose by 175.7 per cent to 25.1 million in March compared to the lockdown month of the previous year, the Federal Statistical Office said Tuesday. However, the level of the pre-crisis month of March 2019 was still undercut by almost a quarter (minus 23.7 per cent).\n\n+++\n\n04.05.2022: More than 25 million Covid cases registered\n\nBerlin (dpa) -Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 25 million coronavirus infections have been officially registered in Germany. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reported a total of 25,033,970 infections on Wednesday. According to experts, the number of actual cases could already be 50 million or more. Only about half a year ago, the number of infections recorded in Germany since the beginning of the pandemic had been under five million. With the spread of the omicron variant of the virus, the number of infections reported daily has skyrocketed.\n\n+++\n\n16.03.2022: Partial vaccination obligation applies from Wednesday\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The so-called facility-based vaccination obligation has been in effect for workers in care professions since Wednesday. They had until Tuesday to submit proof of vaccination or convalescence - or a certificate that they cannot be vaccinated. Unvaccinated health workers could now face consequences. The authorities are allowed to impose fines, bans on activities and bans on entering.\n\n+++\n\n14.03.2022: VW stops production in Changchun\n\nBeijing (dpa) - Volkswagen has temporarily halted production at three of its plants due to a Corona lockdown in the northeastern Chinese metropolis of Changchun. The plants, which are operated jointly with Chinese partner FAW, are to remain closed for the time being for three days up to and including Wednesday on the orders of the authorities, a VW spokeswoman in Beijing said. According to the statement, one VW plant, one Audi plant and one component plant are affected. On Friday, the authorities in Changchun had ordered a lockdown for the city of nine million people after the Corona figures had risen significantly in recent days.\n\n+++\n\n10.03.2022: Record number of new Corona infections\n\nBerlin (dpa) - For the first time in the Corona pandemic, more than 250,000 new Corona infections have been reported to the Robert Koch Institute within one day. According to the RKI, the health authorities reported 262,752 cases in 24 hours on Thursday morning.\n\n+++\n\n09.03.2022: Corona rules from 20 March with hotspot regulation\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The Corona rules are to be largely dropped on 20 March, but a hotspot regulation is to give the Länder the possibility to intervene. Justice Minister Marco Buschmann (FDP) and Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) agreed on this, according to their own statements. \"I think we have found a very good compromise,\" said Buschmann on Wednesday on the ZDF \"Morgenmagazin\". This was based on two pillars: On the one hand, there will be \"practically no more restrictions in the everyday life of citizens\". Exceptions would be masks and tests where there are many vulnerable people, i.e. in nursing or in hospitals. Masks could also be compulsory in public transport. The second pillar is a hotspot regulation: Additional measures could be taken in areas with difficult outbreaks, such as when the health system is overloaded or dangerous new virus variants are found. The Länder could decide this immediately through their parliaments, Lauterbach said. Then there could also be testing and vaccination certificates again.\n\n+++\n\n07.03.2022: Tourism industry on the verge of a comeback\n\nFrankfurt/Main (dpa) - The tourism industry, hit hard by the Corona crisis, sees light at the end of the tunnel. More and more countries are easing their travel restrictions, in Germany all far-reaching restrictions are to be dropped by mid-March. Tour operators, travel agents and hoteliers are hoping for a strong summer. \"The signs are good that we will see summer business approaching pre-pandemic levels this year,\" says Stefan Baumert, managing director of Tui Deutschland. \"Since the end of January, arrivals have been above 2019 levels.\" However, \"a dark shadow of uncertainty\" is cast by Russia's war in Ukraine, says Norbert Fiebig, president of the travel association DRV.\n\n+++\n\n04.03.2022: Fewer Corona restrictions\n\nBerlin (dpa) - After months of Corona restrictions, further measures have been dropped in Germany. In restaurants and hotels, the 3G rule now applies, according to which even unvaccinated people with a negative test are allowed to eat in restaurants, for example. Clubs and discos that have been closed for a long time are also allowed to reopen, and the 2G-plus rule applies there. So only recovered people and vaccinated people with a test or with a third vaccination are allowed. The new relaxations are the second step of the nationwide relaxation plan that the federal and state governments agreed on in mid-February. More guests are now allowed at events. The federal and state governments had determined that more vaccinated or recovered spectators (2G) could be allowed at large events than before - indoors, the maximum number is 6,000 people at a maximum capacity of 60 per cent. Outdoors, 75 per cent of the maximum capacity may be used and a maximum of 25 000 people are allowed. From 20 March, \"all more profound\" measures are to be dropped if the situation in the clinics permits.\n\n+++\n\n03.03.2022: No more high-risk countries\n\nBerlin (dpa) - As of midnight, no more countries are considered high-risk areas with further requirements such as quarantine obligations upon entry, as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has announced. The background to this are changes to the nationwide entry regulations that will take effect on Thursday. According to these, only states and regions are now classified as high-risk areas in which virus variants with \"more worrying characteristics\" are rampant than the Omicron variant that dominates in this country. For all entries into Germany, however, the 3G rule still applies, as the Federal Ministry of Health emphasised: anyone who has not been vaccinated or has recovered must have a negative test. This proof requirement now applies from the age of twelve instead of six.\n\n+++\n\n02.03.2022: Drosten: No infection-free summer\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Despite the decreasing number of Corona infections in Germany, virologist Christian Drosten assumes that it will still be possible to contract the Omicron variant of the virus in summer. On the one hand, the current vaccination progress is not sufficient, on the other hand, the infection activity by Omicron is still high, said the scientist from the Berlin Charité in the podcast \"Coronavirus Update\" on NDR-Info. \"Therefore, I assume that there will not be an infection-free summer.\" He believes it is advisable to continue wearing masks indoors in the summer. This is \"the most efficient measure of all\".\n\n+++\n\n28.02.2022: Almost 40 countries removed from Corona risk list\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Almost 40 countries were removed from the list of Corona high-risk areas by the German government on Sunday, including the following EU states: Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, Croatia, Luxembourg, Poland, Sweden, Hungary. In addition, the overseas territories of France Guadeloupe, St. Barthélemy, St. Martin as well as the overseas territories of the Netherlands Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, St. Eustatius, Saba, St. Martin. In addition, the following have been removed from the risk list: Albania, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Ecuador, Grenada, Guyana, Iraq, Kosovo, Madagascar, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Moldova, Saint Lucia, San Marino, Serbia, Seychelles, Suriname and Ukraine. For travellers coming from countries that are no longer classified as high-risk areas, the return to Germany is made easier.\n\n+++\n\n25.02.2022: Lauterbach: \"Pandemic cannot be ended by celebration\"\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach opposes the abolition of the vast majority of state Corona restrictions as of 20 March. The SPD politician said that the virus would not be impressed by a \"Freedom Day\". \"The pandemic cannot be ended by a celebration.\" Even after 20 March, when many protective measures are to be removed, the federal states would need more tools to fight the pandemic than testing and wearing masks. \"That is not nearly enough to respond to future waves,\" Lauterbach said. They would \"rather have to be able to make gatherings safer in regional hotspots by restricting access\". A new, nationwide legal basis is being sought for this.\n\n+++\n\n24.02.2022: Modellers expect resurgence in infection figures\n\nBerlin (dpa) - A group of Berlin modellers expects a trend reversal in the Corona situation in Germany. From the end of February, they expect a renewed increase in infection figures due to the omicron sub-variant BA.2, writes a team led by Kai Nagel of the Technical University of Berlin (TU) in a report published on Wednesday. BA.2 is considered to be even more transmissible than the omicron subtype BA.1, which has so far mainly been spread in this country. The team advises to closely monitor the situation, also in view of the course in Denmark with a resurgence of hospital admissions, \"in order to be able to take appropriate measures promptly if necessary\".\n\n+++\n\n23.02.2022: Survey: Corona crisis has made majority of citizens more modest\n\nHamburg (dpa) - According to a survey, the majority of citizens in Germany have become more restrained in their consumer behaviour during the Corona crisis. In a new study by the Opaschowski Institute for Futurology, 60 percent of those surveyed said their attitude to life had changed permanently. They agreed with the statement: \"When consuming and spending money, I have become more moderate and modest - and I don't miss anything.\" Part of the population is forced to save money by rising prices, explained Horst Opaschowski, a futurologist from Hamburg. But there is a second section of the population that voluntarily and consciously wants to be more modest in its consumption. \"Across all social and age groups, the change in consumer behaviour is proving to be a stabilising trend.\"\n\n+++\n\n22.02.2022: Tax revenues up significantly in January\n\nThe tax revenues of the federal and state governments rose significantly in January: they climbed by 22.4 per cent to 57.55 billion euros. This is shown in the current monthly report of the Federal Ministry of Finance. The largest increases were recorded in turnover, wage and income tax, from which the Länder in particular benefited.\n\n+++\n\n21.02.2022: Government expects first Novavax delivery as of Monday\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The first doses of the Corona vaccine from US manufacturer Novavax are expected in Germany this week. \"We are expecting the first delivery from Monday,\" said a spokeswoman for the Federal Ministry of Health in Berlin. It is hoped that the Novavax vaccine will be an alternative for all those who have reservations about mRNA vaccines. The Novavax vaccine is based on a classical method. It consists of virus-like particles containing the spike protein of the coronavirus and an effect enhancer.\n\n+++\n\n20.02.2022: Survey: Every second person wants to continue wearing a mask\n\nBerlin (dpa) - More than one in two citizens in Germany wants to continue wearing masks even after the compulsory wearing of masks is phased out. This is the result of a representative survey conducted by the polling institute Insa for the newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\". Fifty-two per cent of those surveyed said they would continue to wear masks even without the obligation - 79 per cent of them in public transport, 76 per cent in retail, 66 per cent in long-distance transport, 51 per cent in services close to the body, 39 per cent in cultural institutions, 23 per cent in restaurants and 22 per cent at work. On the other hand, 41 percent of the respondents want to do without the mask as soon as the obligation is lifted in the course of the relaxation of Corona measures. A majority, in turn, is also in favour of keeping the mask obligation beyond 20 March, especially in buses, trains and in retail. The federal and state governments have agreed that the vast majority of Corona restrictions should fall by 20 March.\n\n+++\n\n18.02.2022: Researchers: Pandemic cost Germany 330 billion in economic output\n\nMunich (dpa) - According to calculations by the Munich Ifo Institute, the pandemic has reduced Germany's economic output by a total of 330 billion euros in the past two years. Instead of growing twice by 1.3 per cent, the economy had shrunk in the meantime. Ifo expert Timo Wollmershäuser said that this does not take into account future losses in value creation, for example due to shortfalls in education. Ifo head Clemens Fuest spoke of the \"worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s\". It was therefore right that the federal government had resolutely stabilised the economy.\n\n+++\n\n17.02.2022: Corona restrictions to fall until 20 March\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The federal and state governments have agreed on the withdrawal of Corona measures in three stages over the next four weeks until the start of spring on 20 March. From then on, \"all more far-reaching protective measures are to be dropped if the situation in the hospitals permits\". Only \"basic protection\" with mandatory masks indoors and in buses and trains is to remain.\n\n+++\n\n16.02.2022: Biontech wants to produce vaccine in Africa\n\nMarburg/Mainz (dpa) - The Mainz-based pharmaceutical company Biontech wants to inform about plans for sustainable vaccine production in Africa this Wednesday. Beforehand, the Corona vaccine manufacturer expects project partners, including government representatives, to attend a meeting on the topic at its site in Marburg, Hesse. The presidents of Ghana and Rwanda, Nana Akufo-Addo and Paul Kagame, as well as the Director General of the World Health Organisation WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, are expected to be present. Biontech has been producing Corona vaccine at its Marburg plant for about a year.\n\n+++\n\n15.02.2022: Bioinformatician sees saturation effect\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The breaking of the omicron wave can be explained by a kind of saturation effect in the view of bioinformatician Lars Kaderali. \"With the increasing number of recovered people, the virus finds fewer and fewer people who are still susceptible to infection,\" said the Greifswald scientist in response to a question from the Deutsche Presse-Agentur. However, new contact networks could emerge as a result of the relaxation of the Corona measures, in which the spread of the virus could pick up speed again. \"That's why we also say: only relax cautiously,\" said Kaderali, who is a member of the Federal Government's Corona Expert Council.\n\n+++\n\n14.02.2022: Council of experts considers easing possible\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The German government's expert council considers corona easings possible in the coming weeks under certain conditions. \"The number of infections has risen steadily so far, but a plateauing and subsequent drop for the omicron wave can be expected in the coming weeks,\" the council said in a statement on Sunday evening. Meanwhile, the nationwide seven-day incidence fell for the second day in a row. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) gave the figure of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week at 1459.8 on Monday morning. The previous day, the value had fallen for the first time since the end of December and stood at 1466.5.\n\n+++\n\n13.02.2022: Poll: Majority wants early relaxation\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Despite continuing high infection figures, a majority of citizens are in favour of loosening the Corona measures soon, according to a recent poll. 23 per cent of the respondents think there should be relaxations now, 38 per cent would welcome it in two to three weeks, according to the ZDF \"Politbarometer\". Another 38 percent, however, say that there should be more time for easing.\n\n+++\n\n12.02.2022: Corona relaxations possible\n\nBerlin (dpa) - After weeks of rising corona infection figures in Germany, nationwide relaxations in everyday restrictions are concretely on the agenda. The scientific forecasts showed that the peak of the omicron wave was in sight, said Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \"That allows us to set our sights on a first opening step at the federal-state meeting next week and then others for the spring.\" Scholz said in the Bundesrat, with a view to possible openings, that one would be guided by scientific expertise as before. \"Because we don't want to jeopardise our success now.\"\n\n+++\n\n11.02.2022: Berlinale starts with hygiene concept\n\nBerlin (dpa) - After the opening of the Berlinale on Thursday evening, the real festival begins on Friday with special conditions. In view of the infection situation, there had been a long struggle about how to organise the Berlinale. \"But the really, really important thing is: the Berlinale, it is taking place,\" said Minister of State for Culture Claudia Roth (Greens). Film creates invaluable perspectives on the past, present and future, Roth said. Along with Cannes and Venice, the Berlinale is one of the world's major film festivals.\n\n+++\n\n10.02.2022: WHO is 16 billion short: Germany pledges further support\n\nGeneva (dpa) - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 16 billion dollars (13.98 billion euros) are still needed this year to support poorer countries in the fight against Corona. On Wednesday in Geneva, the WHO put the gap in the budget for the supply of such states with vaccines, tests and medicines at this size. The money is to flow into a program launched by the United Nations. It could create a pool of 600 million vaccine doses, buy 700 million tests and provide treatment for 120 million patients, it said. Germany - one of the campaign's largest and most reliable donors to date, with 2.2 billion euros - announced further support. \"We plan to contribute our fair share again in 2022,\" said State Secretary Niels Annen of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation.\n\n+++\n\n09.02.2022: Exports more than make up for slump in Corona crisis 2020\n\nWiesbaden (dpa) - After catching up last year, German exports have clearly exceeded the level before the Corona crisis. Exports of goods rose strongly by 14.0 per cent to 1,375.5 billion euros compared to the previous year, as the Federal Statistical Office announced in Wiesbaden on Wednesday. They were thus 3.6 per cent above the level of the pre-crisis year 2019. According to the data, the largest single market for goods \"Made in Germany\" last year was again the USA, followed by China and France.\n\n+++\n\n08.02.2022: Tui expects strong summer and wants to repay state aid\n\nHanover (dpa) - The travel group Tui expects a strong summer business despite the virus variant Omicron and wants to pay back the first part of the state aid. The plan is to return aid money from the Corona crisis amounting to around 0.7 billion euros, Tui announced when it presented its figures for the first winter quarter in Hanover on Tuesday. \"Demand for travel is high across all markets,\" said chief executive Fritz Joussen. \"The path out of the pandemic is becoming increasingly clear.\"\n\n+++\n\n07.02.2022: Lauterbach: Ease significantly before Easter\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Just over a week before the next prime ministers conference, Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has held out the prospect of an early relaxation of Corona restrictions. \"I believe that we will relax well before Easter. I am firmly convinced of that,\" he told the newspaper \"Bild\". Easter is in mid-April this year. The next top-level meeting between the prime ministers and Scholz is planned for 16 February. There, nationwide relaxations could be agreed upon.\n\n+++\n\n06.02.2022: Hundreds of pharmacies to start Covid vaccinations\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Several hundred pharmacies in Germany are expected to start offering Covid vaccinations as early as Tuesday. This is the assumption of the Federal Association of German Pharmacists (ABDA). The association also expects the number of participating pharmacies to grow successively. There are about 18,500 pharmacies throughout Germany. In the meantime, a good 6,000 pharmacists have completed the necessary training for the vaccination offer, explained ABDA President Gabriele Regina Overwiening. The offer is voluntary and intended as a supplement to the vaccination offers in doctors' surgeries and vaccination centres. The Covid 19 vaccination is the first vaccination that pharmacies can offer nationwide.\n\n+++\n\n05.02.2022: Government removes more African countries from risk list\n\nBerlin (dpa)- For the second time in a row, the German government is removing numerous African countries from its list of high-risk areas. On Sunday, 33 countries will be taken off the risk list, as announced by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Already a week ago, 13 African countries had been downgraded. Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Palestinian Territories are newly classified as high-risk areas. Anyone entering from a high-risk area who is not fully vaccinated or recovered must be quarantined for ten days and can be exempted with a negative test no earlier than five days after entry. Countries and regions with a particularly high risk of infection with the coronavirus are classified as high-risk areas. Currently, about three quarters of all approximately 200 countries worldwide are classified as high-risk areas.\n\n27.01.2022: Bundestag: Orientation debate on compulsory vaccination\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The introduction of a general vaccination obligation in the fight against the Corona pandemic has been discussed passionately but largely objectively in the Bundestag. In a first extensive debate on this socially explosive issue, the opinions of proponents and opponents clashed on Wednesday. Prominent supporters like Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) saw it as the only way to overcome the pandemic. Opponents such as Bundestag Vice President Wolfgang Kubicki or Gregor Gysi of the Left Party, on the other hand, considered compulsory vaccination to be unsuitable, disproportionate and dangerous for trust in democracy. Only the AfD rejects vaccination in general.\n\n+++\n\n26.01.2022: Germany overtakes US as largest WHO donor\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday said Germany has become its largest donor, a position previously held by the United States. \"As you all know, Germany has been an important friend and longstanding partner to WHO and in fact it is now WHO's largest donor,\" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus according to EUobserver.\n\n+++\n\n25.01.2022: Corona protests: Steinmeier sees red line crossed\n\nFederal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has condemned hate and violence in the course of the debates on Corona measures. \"Those who oppose our law and associate themselves with self-declared enemies of the state and right-wing extremists known to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution can no longer credibly invoke democracy and freedom,\" Steinmeier said on Monday at a roundtable discussion on \"Hate and Violence in Times of Pandemic\". Referring to the numerous unannounced demonstrations by opponents of the Corona measures in recent months, the Federal President said, \"The 'walk' has lost its innocence.\" The red line runs exactly \"where violence comes into play\".\n\n+++\n\n24.01.2022: More than 150 countries on list of high-risk areas\n\nBerlin (dpa) - A further 19 states have been classified by Germany as high-risk areas since Sunday, which entails travel warnings and certain quarantine rules on entry. In Europe, these now include Romania, the Republic of Moldova and Kosovo; worldwide, Japan, India and Brazil, among others, have been added. In total, 155 countries are on the risk list of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Anyone entering from a high-risk area who does not have at least the full basic protection of a covid vaccination or has recovered must be quarantined for ten days and can be exempted from this with a negative test five days after entry at the earliest.\n\n+++\n\n23.01.2022: Lauterbach announces new vaccination campaign in different languages\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has announced a new vaccination campaign in the Corona pandemic for next week. \"We have a duty to reach people,\" the SPD politician said in a newspaper interview. Therefore, a campaign with posters as well as radio and TV spots will start on Tuesday. This campaign is \"more creative\" than previous campaigns. \"And it is in different languages,\" Lauterbach added. \"We have to try everything to close the vaccination gap, that is also a prerequisite for a possible compulsory vaccination.\" In Germany, 73.3 per cent of the population have their basic immunisation.\n\n+++\n\n22.01.2022: Government prepares for rising numbers of sick people\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The German government wants to prepare Germany organisationally for the rapid growth of Corona infections with hundreds of thousands of infected people expected every day. Experts expect this \"omicron wall\" to reach hospitals after two weeks at the earliest. Modified quarantine and testing rules ensure that public life can still take place safely, especially in critical infrastructure, the health ministry said. Critical infrastructure includes health care, utilities and security agencies. On Monday, the federal and state governments will coordinate at a conference of minister presidents.\n\n+++\n\n21.01.2022: New drugs against omicron give hope\n\nMunich (dpa) - According to a study published in the scientific journal \"Cell\", in which German teams from Göttingen, Hanover, Braunschweig and Erlangen were involved, several preparations seem to lose their effectiveness against omicron. According to studies, only the new antibody preparation sotrovimab still inhibits severe courses. Hopes are now pinned on new antiviral drugs such as paxlovid and molnupiravir. They should be available on prescription in pharmacies in a few weeks.\n\n+++\n\n20.01.2022: Scholz promotes \"truly global\" vaccination campaign\n\nBerlin/Davos (dpa) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called for stronger efforts for a global vaccination campaign against Corona. \"Without a truly global immunisation campaign, we will soon run out of letters in the Greek alphabet to name new virus variants,\" the SPD politician warned at the World Economic Forum's Davos Virtual Dialogue on Wednesday. Germany, already the second largest donor to the Covax campaign, will continue to contribute, he promised. \"Through our support for Covax, we want to reach 70 per cent of the world's population by the middle of the year.\"\n\n+++\n\n19.01.2022: Over 100,000 new infections - compulsory vaccination as early as April?\n\nBerlin (dpa) - With a delay to other EU countries, the number of cases in Germany is also reaching previously unknown heights. On Wednesday, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reported more than 100,000 infections reported within one day for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Against this backdrop, Federal Health Minister Lauterbach believes it is important that a general vaccination requirement may come into force as early as April after a corresponding decision by the Bundestag. Because unvaccinated people would then have to go through \"three vaccination cycles (...) and by then you are already in September or October\".\n\n+++\n\n18.01.2022: Germany strong production location for Corona drugs\n\nFrankfurt (dpa) - With Biontech, Germany is not only a strong production location for corona vaccines, but also for corona drugs. Large therapeutics companies from the USA and Switzerland rely on Germany as a production location. The US company and Biontech partner Pfizer, for example, manufactures its drug Paxlovid against severe covid courses mainly in Freiburg. The Swiss company Roche has its drug Roactemra filled and packaged in Mannheim, among other places. The drug is administered to combat the body's own immune system overreaction in severely advanced corona diseases.\n\n+++\n\n17.01.2022: Ex-constitutional judge considers compulsory vaccination possible\n\nOsnabrück. The former Federal Constitutional Court judge Gertrude Lübbe-Wolff considers it unlikely that a general Corona vaccination obligation would fail at the Federal Constitutional Court. This instrument has already been used successfully in the past: \"German as well as foreign and international courts regularly do not object in principle to general vaccination obligations or to those existing for certain population groups, such as soldiers,\" writes Lübbe-Wolff in a guest article for the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (NOZ). This is also not the case when it comes to diseases that are less frequently fatal or less frequently cause serious permanent damage. \"In the interest of the general public and for the protection of those who cannot be vaccinated for special medical reasons, certain, in individual cases quite serious, impairments caused by vaccination requirements are to be accepted,\" writes Lübbe-Wolff.\n\n+++\n\n16.01.2022: Austria and many other countries high-risk area\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The Federal Government has again classified Austria as a Corona high-risk area. The regulation has been in effect since midnight and has concrete consequences: Anyone entering Germany from a high-risk area who does not have at least complete basic protection with the usually necessary second vaccination, or who has recovered, must be quarantined for ten days. After five days at the earliest, one can be exempted with a negative test. For children who have not yet reached the age of six, the quarantine ends automatically five days after entry. This means that all nine of Germany's neighbouring countries are now on the risk list. Denmark, Poland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands have long been designated as high-risk areas. In addition to Austria, more than 30 other countries have been on the risk list since Sunday, many of them in Africa and the Caribbean. In total, almost 140 of the approximately 200 countries in the world are now listed there.\n\n+++\n\n15.01.2022: Lauterbach counts on slowing down the omicron wave\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach expects the omicron wave to continue rising - but for the time being sees no reason for new stricter daily requirements in the fight against the coronavirus. \"I think we are now entering difficult waters,\" the minister said in Berlin on Friday. Clinics and laboratories would reach their limits. At the moment, however, the package of countermeasures was sufficient. The strategy is to slow down and stretch out the wave of infection and to boost as many people as possible with booster vaccinations during this time.\n\n08.01.2022: New study on the consequences of mild courses of the disease\n\nHamburg - According to a study by the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), even mild to moderate courses of Covid 19 can impair the functions of the heart, lungs and kidneys in the medium term. According to the hospital, there are also frequent signs of leg vein thrombosis. The finding that even a mild course of the disease can lead to damage of various organs in the medium term is of utmost importance, especially with regard to the current Omikron variant, which seems to be accompanied by milder symptoms in the majority of cases, said Prof. Dr. Raphael Twerenbold, scientific study centre director and cardiologist at the University Heart and Vascular Centre of the UKE. 443 participants between the ages of 45 and 74 were examined.\n\n+++\n\n07.01.2022: RKI: Omicron is increasing rapidly\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The share of omicron in infections in Germany is increasing rapidly. In calendar week 52 (until 2 January), 44.3 per cent of the corona detections examined for variants were due to omicron, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). A week earlier, the value was still given as 15.8 per cent. The new variant was reported from South Africa in November. It is much more contagious than the previously dominant delta variant. At the same time, experts assume that Omicron tends to lead to milder courses of the disease and that infected persons need to go to hospital less often.\n\n+++\n\n06.01.2022: Scientists: Corona improves diagnostics for the future\n\nGreifswald (dpa) - Scientists see opportunities for the future fight against other pathogens in the expansion of molecular biological examination methods during the Corona pandemic. With a view to sequencing - i.e. the extensive decoding of a pathogen's genome - the head hygienist at Greifswald University Medical Centre said: \"This makes it possible to go much deeper.\" Bacteria, for example, could belong to the same species, but have completely different characteristics. With a more precise analysis, antibiotics could be saved and therapies and prevention could be better adapted. Corona has also been sequenced in Germany, said Karsten Becker, Head of Medical Microbiology in Greifswald. The monitoring of the different Corona variants, however, has given the expensive and time-consuming method a boost. At his institution, the method had previously been used in research, but not in patient care. \"It is not the case that if Corona is now over, we will throw it away.\" In the future, sequencing will also be used to monitor pathogen resistance and identify pathogens that cannot be detected using conventional methods. \"That's why this is a brilliant investment for us, also for the future.”\n\n+++\n\n05.01.2022: 150 million Corona vaccinations reached in Germany\n\nBerlin (dpa) - A good year after the start of the Corona vaccination campaign in Germany, the mark of 150 million vaccinations has been reached. The complete basic protection with the usually necessary second shot has now been given to 59.3 million people or 71.3 percent of the population, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). At least 32.7 million vaccinated people or 39.3 percent of the population have received an additional booster vaccination. This third \"booster\" dose is now considered important for effective protection against the more contagious virus variant Omicron.\n\n+++\n\n04.01.2022: Epidemics exhibition in Hildesheim\n\nHildesheim (dpa) - Until 1 May 2022, the exhibition \"Epidemics. Curse of the Past - Threat to the Future\" tells the story of diseases such as the plague, Ebola or AIDS at the Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum (RPM) in Hildesheim. So far, about 17,000 guests have visited the exhibition, said museum spokesman Benjamin Riebsamen. Compared to other museums in Germany, the RPM is in a good position with this number in times of a pandemic. For centuries, more people have died as a result of infectious diseases than in wars or natural disasters. Before the Corona pandemic, many people were not even aware of this.\n\n+++\n\n03.01.2022: Central Council of Muslims for compulsory corona vaccination\n\nThe chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, Aiman Mazyek, pleads for a general obligation to vaccinate against the corona virus. Mazyek told the \"Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung\" that vaccination saves lives, vaccination means solidarity. \"This is true according to the standards of the reasonable citizen and the ethics of Islam,\" Mazyek added. He called it \"annoying\" that the vaccination rate was only slowly increasing.\n\n+++\n\n02.01.2022: Survey: Almost 80 percent do not believe in normalisation in 2022\n\nBerlin (dpa) - People in Germany are more pessimistic about the further development of the Corona pandemic than they were a year ago. According to a survey conducted by the opinion research institute YouGov on behalf of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, only 15 percent believe that the pandemic will be largely or completely overcome in the coming year. 79 percent, on the other hand, believe that the virus will continue to affect life in Germany at least partially throughout the year. 34 percent even expect a strong impairment.\n\n+++\n\n01.01.2022: Italy, Malta and Canada now Corona high-risk areas\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The popular holiday destinations Italy and Malta have been considered high-risk areas since Saturday because of their high Corona infection rates. Canada and San Marino in north-eastern Italy have now also been classified as such by the German government. Anyone entering from a high-risk area who is not fully vaccinated or recovered must be quarantined for ten days and can be exempted with a negative test no earlier than five days after entry.\n\n+++\n\n31.12.2021: Scholz appeals for cohesion in the fight against the pandemic\n\nBerlin (dpa) In his first New Year's address, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for solidarity and decisive action in the fight against the Coronavirus pandemic. \"Let us do everything - but really everything - together to finally defeat the Coronavirus in the New Year,\" Scholz said. In view of a rapid spread of the more infectious virus variant Omicron, he said, it is important to make use of all vaccination offers. \"What matters now is speed. We have to be faster than the virus.\"\n\nScholz addressed the citizens for the first time in a New Year's speech after being elected Angela Merkel's successor at the beginning of December. In his speech, he asked for understanding for the restrictions due to the Coronavirus pandemic. There are to be no large New Year's Eve parties in Germany this year, and fireworks are also to be cancelled. Contact restrictions are also in place. \"Please take these restrictions very seriously. For your protection, for the protection of your families. For the protection of all of us,\" the Chancellor warned.\n\n+++\n\n30.12.2021: Germany to donate another 75 million vaccine doses\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The new German government wants to donate at least 75 million vaccine doses to poorer countries next year without limiting its own vaccination campaign. Development Minister Svenja Schulze (SPD) told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) that the target of 100 million doses set for 2021 had been reached. \"But we must not stop there. For the coming year, we are planning to donate at least 75 million more doses.”\n\n+++\n\n29.12.2021: Federal government buys Paxlovid\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The Federal Government is buying one million packs of the drug Paxlovid from the US company Pfizer against severe covid courses. This was announced by Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. The first deliveries are expected before the end of January, he said. \"The drug is extremely promising because it can significantly weaken the severe course of covid when administered early. I expect that we can use it to prevent numerous severe courses in intensive care units.\" The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted emergency approval for the drug just before Christmas. According to the FDA, it is the first Covid drug in the USA that can be taken in tablet form. Lauterbach also announced an emergency approval: \"So that Paxlovid can be used immediately upon delivery, I have initiated the procedure for emergency approval in Germany together with the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices,\" he said.\n\n+++\n\n22.12.2021: Ethics Council in favour of extending mandatory vaccination\n\nBerlin (dpa) -The German Ethics Council is in favour of extending the recently adopted mandatory vaccination against the coronavirus for staff in institutions such as clinics and nursing homes to \"substantial parts of the population\". However, this must be accompanied by further measures, according to a recommendation adopted by a majority of the independent body that advises the federal government on ethical issues related to the corona pandemic. In addition to nationwide vaccination offers and sufficient vaccine, the vaccine should be freely selectable as far as possible.\n\nThe Ethics Council had been asked for an assessment. The background to this is that the federal parliament will probably vote on a general mandatory vaccination at the beginning of 2022 - Chancellor Olaf Scholz, among others, had spoken out in favour of this. A first limited mandatory vaccination was already decided in mid-December: Employees in institutions with vulnerable people, such as clinics and nursing homes, must prove by 15 March 2022 that they have been vaccinated or have recovered from a covid disease.\n\n+++\n\n21.12.2021: Robert Koch Institute increases risk assessment\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Because of the Omikron variant of the coronavirus, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany has tightened its risk assessment. For those who have been vaccinated twice against the virus and those who have recovered from an infection, the risk of infection is now considered \"high\", the RKI announced on Twitter. For the unvaccinated, it remains \"very high\". For vaccinated persons with a booster vaccination, however, the institute estimates the risk as moderate. Overall, the health risk to the population is assessed as \"very high\". The Institute warns against a sudden increase in the number of cases. The heads of the federal and state governments will discuss tougher Corona measures in Germany on Tuesday.\n\n+++\n\n20.12.2021: Great Britain classified as a virus variant area\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Due to the massive spread of the Omikron variant in Great Britain, the country has been considered a virus variant area since Monday. Entry into Germany from such areas is possible with severe restrictions. Airlines are now essentially only allowed to transport German citizens or people living in Germany from the UK to Germany. A two-week quarantine obligation also applies to those entering the country - including those who have been vaccinated and those who have recovered from a Covid infection.\n\n+++\n\n19.12.2021: France and Denmark new Corona high-risk areas\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The German government now classifies France and Denmark as high-risk areas due to high Corona infection figures. The regulation came into force at midnight on Sunday night. With the exception of Luxembourg, all of Germany's neighbouring countries are now considered high-risk areas. Anyone entering from there who has not been fully vaccinated or has not recovered must generally be quarantined for ten days. With a negative test, you can be released after five days at the earliest.\n\n+++\n\n18.12.2021: German health minister warns of massive omicron wave\n\nBerlin/Hanover (dpa) - Germany is facing a massive fifth Corona wave with the new omicron variant, according to German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. The omicron wave can be delayed but not prevented, Lauterbach said. Germany must prepare itself for a challenge that has never been seen before in this form, he said.\n\nDue to the corona pandemic, a comprehensive ban on the sale of fireworks is again in force in Germany on New Year's Eve. The aim is to prevent accidents caused by the improper use of firecrackers and rockets and thus to spare the hospitals, which are already extremely burdened by Corona.\n\n+++\n\n17.12.2021: High vaccination tempo in Germany\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The pace of Covid vaccinations in Germany has picked up considerably. Last week, there was an all-time high in vaccinations with over 6.6 million, according to the Robert Koch Institute. This week, a daily record since the start of the vaccination campaign was also reached already on Wednesday with almost 1.5 million vaccinations. Overall, the mark of 70 percent of all inhabitants with complete basic protection has now been surpassed.\n\nThe nationwide seven-day incidence continues to fall. The Robert Koch Institute reported the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week at 331.8 on Friday morning. For comparison: The day before, the value was 340.1. A week ago, the nationwide incidence was 413.7.\n\n+++\n\n16.12.2021: 92 million additional Covid vaccine doses\n\nBerlin (dpa) -In Germany, the Federal Ministry of Health wants to buy 92 million additional Covid vaccine doses. Of these, 80 million doses are to be procured from Biontech via EU contracts and 12 million doses directly, as the ministry announced after the Bundestag budget committee agreed. 2.2 billion euros have been released for this purpose. First and foremost, the Ministry of Health explained, it was a matter of making the start of the year reasonable. According to the government's plans, there will be up to 30 million first, second and booster vaccinations in Germany by the end of the year.\n\n+++\n\n15.12.2021: Relief for triple vaccinated people\n\nBerlin (dpa)- In the fight against Corona, the first relief for triple vaccinated people is possible in Germany. The health ministers of the federal and state governments agreed that for the time being, additional tests for Corona access rules will largely be omitted for vaccinated persons with a booster vaccination. However, these facilitations are to be reviewed after two months at the latest. The background to this is that in some cases a negative Corona test is also required for access only for vaccinated and recovered persons. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach considers the omission of extra tests for triple vaccinated persons to be justified: With a booster vaccination, one only has a low risk of becoming infected - and an even lower risk of being contagious to others.\n\n+++\n\n14.12.2021: Corona situation apparently eases somewhat\n\nBerlin (dpa) - A few days before Christmas, the Corona situation seems to be easing somewhat. Apparently, fewer people in Germany are now infected with the virus again. The nationwide seven-day incidence dropped again: The Robert Koch Institute reported the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants and week at 375 on Tuesday morning. The previous day, the value had been 389.2. A week ago, the nationwide incidence was 432.2. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach had written on Twitter on Monday: \"The situation is slowly stabilising and the decline in case numbers is real.\" However, experts are worried about the new corona variant Omikron, which could also spread strongly in Germany.\n\n+++\n\n13.12.2021: Start of Corona vaccinations for children\n\nBerlin (dpa)- Childhood vaccinations with a Corona vaccine for five to eleven-year-olds are to start in Germany this week. According to the Ministry of Health, more than 2.2 million doses of the child vaccine from Biontech/Pfizer will be distributed to pharmaceutical wholesalers. In addition, there are country quotas that will be made available. Medical practices order the vaccines through pharmacies. The Standing Commission on Vaccination had recommended vaccination of children five to eleven years of age who have risk factors for severe covid-19 or have relatives at high risk. In addition, parents can also have their healthy children vaccinated after individual clarification.\n\n+++\n\n12.12.2021: Launch of new expert panel\n\nBerlin (dpa) - A new expert committee is to put the scientific advice of the Federal Government on a broader basis. The fight against pandemics should be based more on scientific expertise, said Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. He announced that for him, close cooperation with the Council's scientists would become the basis of his policy. The newspaper \"Welt am Sonntag\" reported that the so-called Scientific Expert Panel included Christian Drosten, chief virologist at the Charité hospital in Berlin, and Hendrik Streeck, head of the Virological Institute at the University Hospital in Bonn.\n\nMeanwhile, the nationwide seven-day incidence has dropped again compared to the previous day. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) gave the value of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants and week on Sunday as 390.9. On the previous day, the value had been 402.9. On Friday, more than one million people in Germany received a vaccination against the coronavirus for the fourth day in a row.\n\n+++\n\n11.12.2021: First limited Corona vaccination obligation\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Germany will introduce a limited Corona vaccination obligation for health care personnel. This and other new regulations in the fight against the pandemic were decided by the Bundestag and the federal states in the Bundesrat. Employees in facilities with people in need of protection, such as nursing homes and clinics, must prove by mid-March 2022 that they have been vaccinated or have recovered. Moreover, in addition to doctors, pharmacists, dentists and veterinarians will also be able to vaccinate in future. Options for the federal states to impose tougher regional restrictions in the event of very high infection rates will be supplemented and extended.\n\nThe new Federal Minister of Health, Karl Lauterbach, said in the parliament that the new government will undertake many things, but that the primary goal was to protect the population in this health crisis. \"We will therefore do everything we can to end this crisis as quickly as possible,\" Lauterbach said. The new government of SPD, Greens and FDP with Chancellor Olaf Scholz at its head has been in office since Wednesday. In Germany, the Corona situation has been very tense for weeks. However, the vaccination campaign has recently picked up speed. A general vaccination obligation is also being discussed.\n\n+++\n\n10.12.2021: Study: Germany quite crisis-proof in the pandemic\n\nGütersloh (dpa) - According to an analysis, Germany's democracy, state and administration, economy and social security proved to be robust in the Corona pandemic. According to a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Federal Republic of Germany performed well in an international comparison of 29 industrialised countries and was in the top group after Sweden and New Zealand in terms of crisis resistance. For this, 94 indicators were examined in the first Corona year, more than 70 experts had prepared country reports. Member states of the European Union (EU) and countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) were taken into account.\n\n+++\n\n09.12.2021: Boosters significantly increase vaccination protection\n\nBerlin (dpa) - A booster vaccination significantly reduces the risk of contracting or dying from Covid-19. This is shown by two Israeli studies in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\". Both studies refer to the mRNA vaccine from Biontech/Pfizer. However, experts consider the results transferable to other vaccinations. Almost 16 million people in Germany have so far had their basic immunisation against the coronavirus refreshed.\n\n+++\n\n08.12.2021: Drosten dampens hopes for end of pandemic in spring\n\nBerlin (dpa) - According to the Berlin virologist Christian Drosten, the Corona pandemic could drag on for some time. In his opinion, the further course of the pandemic depends strongly on the spread of the virus variant Omicron. In South Africa, the growth rates are high despite the onset of summer there. \"And that's why I wouldn't say at the moment that the pandemic will be over in Germany by Easter, when Omicron takes over,\" said the scientist from the Berlin Charité in the new podcast \"Coronavirus Update\" on NDR-Info. \"I think from January we will have a problem with Omicron in Germany,\" Drosten said. The variant will probably make it necessary to adapt the existing vaccines, he said.\n\n+++\n\n07.12.2021: Lauterbach: \"We will win the fight against the pandemic\"\n\nBerlin (dpa) - \"We will win the fight against the pandemic, and we will be better equipped for further pandemics,\" said the designated Health Minister Karl Lauterbach during his presentation at the SPD headquarters in Berlin. The occupation of the post of Minister of Health has been the most discussed question in Germany in the past few days. On Monday, the SPD decided in favour of the 58-year-old epidemiologist and health economist.\n\n+++\n\n06.12.2021: Doctors' representative: Vaccinate as much as possible at weekends\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In order to achieve the goals of the vaccination campaign, the chairwoman of the doctors' union Marburger Bund, Susanne Johna, believes that massive efforts are also needed at weekends. \"People have time on Saturday and Sunday and would also get boostered in much larger numbers,\" Johna told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe. \"No expense or effort should be spared now to advance the vaccination campaign.\" He said it was absolutely right to reach about 30 million vaccinations by Christmas.\n\n+++\n\n05.12.2021: Omicron co-discoverer Preiser: precursors of the variant have been around for a very long time\n\nStellenbosch (dpa) - Precursors of the recently discovered corona variant Omikron may have existed for a very long time, according to their co-discoverer from Germany. \"According to current knowledge, an early form of Omikron evolved as a separate virus type even before Alpha and Delta emerged,\" said Wolfgang Preiser of Stellenbosch University near Cape Town. He is a member of the research consortium that discovered the variant. This type of virus then presumably evolved over many months without attracting attention, Preiser said. \"The question is: Why did Omikron remain hidden for so long and only now get going? Were one or two mutations still missing to be able to spread quickly?\" Omikron could be the dominant variant in Europe in just a few months, according to the EU health authority ECDC.\n\n+++\n\n04.12.2021: Poland and Switzerland to be high-risk areas as of Sunday\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Due to high Corona infection figures, the German government is classifying Poland and Switzerland as high-risk areas from Sunday. Anyone entering from a high-risk area who is not fully vaccinated or recovered will have to be quarantined for ten days and can be exempted with a negative test no earlier than five days after entry.\n\nThe neighbouring countries Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands are also considered high-risk areas. This is automatically linked to a travel warning issued by the Foreign Office against unnecessary tourist trips. It makes it easier for tourists to cancel booked trips free of charge, but does not mean a travel ban. Thus, as of Sunday, more than 60 countries are fully or partially considered high-risk areas.\n\n+++\n\n29.11.2021: Corona crisis team to start soon\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The Corona crisis team planned by the future government coalition in the Chancellor's Office could start its work within the next few days and thus even before the government of SPD, Greens and FDP takes office. According to FDP leader Christian Lindner, the permanent federal-state body is to start in the new week, SPD leader Saskia Esken said on Twitter \"shortly\" as a time horizon.\n\n+++\n\n28.11.2021: Omicron variant of coronavirus also in Germany\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The omicron variant of the coronavirus discovered in southern Africa has reached Germany. According to the Max von Pettenkofer Institute, the variant, which is classified as a cause for concern, was detected in Munich in two travellers who had arrived on a flight from South Africa on 24 November. The authorities in Hesse are investigating the case of another traveller returning from South Africa who, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs, is \"highly suspected\" of having the virus. The virus variant is apparently spreading rapidly, with cases now being reported from many countries. Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged citizens to prevent a lockdown by voluntarily restricting contact.\n\n+++\n\n27.11.2021: Measures against new coronavirus variant\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Due to the spread of a new coronavirus variant in southern Africa, the German government is drastically restricting entry from a total of eight countries in the region. South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, Eswatini, Malawi and Lesotho will be classified as virus variant areas as of Sunday, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced. Airlines are thus essentially only allowed to transport German citizens or persons living in Germany from there to Germany. However, this is not a flight ban. A two-week quarantine obligation applies to those entering the country - even for those who have been vaccinated and those who have recovered. It cannot be shortened by negative tests.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) classified the variant B.1.1.529 as \"variant of concern\" on Friday. Experts fear that the many mutations of the variant will cause the pathogen to spread more quickly or the vaccines to lose their protective effect.\n\n+++\n\n26.11.2021: South Africa to become a virus variant area\n\nJohannesburg/Berlin (dpa) -Germany will declare South Africa a virus variant area because of the newly emerging coronavirus variant B.1.1.529 there. The regulation will come into force on Saturday night, and airlines will then only be allowed to transport German citizens to Germany, the acting Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, announced on Friday morning. If necessary, South Africa's neighbouring countries would also be affected. Experts fear that the B.1.1.529 variant could be highly contagious due to an unusually large number of mutations and could also penetrate the protective shield of the vaccines more easily.\n\n+++\n\n25.11.2021: More than 100,000 Corona deaths in Germany\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The number of people in Germany who have died from or with Corona has exceeded the threshold of 100,000 deaths. The total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic is now 100,119, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The health offices recently reported 351 deaths to the RKI within 24 hours. The seven-day incidence reached another peak on Thursday and now stands at 419.7 infections per 100,000 inhabitants within one week. The number of new infections reported within one day exceeded the threshold of 70,000 for the first time. According to RKI data, the health offices reported 75,961 new Corona cases in 24 hours.\n\n+++\n\n24.11.2021: Seven-day incidence exceeds 400 for the first time\n\nBerlin (dpa) The number of new Corona infections registered within one day has once again reached a new high. In addition, the nationwide seven-day incidence rose above 400 for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the Robert Koch Institute on Wednesday. The Institute gave the value of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants and week at 404.5. For comparison: the day before, the value was 399.8, a week ago 319.5 and in the previous month 106.3. The health authorities in Germany reported 66,884 new Corona infections to the RKI within one day - compared to 52,826 infections exactly one week ago.\n\n+++\n\n23.11.2021: Social psychologist: Lax pressure on unvaccinated people has the opposite effect\n\nMarburg (dpa) - According to a social psychologist, compulsory vaccination could change the attitude of vaccination opponents rather than just continuing to build up pressure to vaccinate. \"A substantial part of the population has walled itself off in the self-image of not getting vaccinated,\" says Marburg social psychologist Ulrich Wagner. In their \"bubble\", this opinion is constantly reaffirmed and reinforced. \"If political pressure is exerted, there is a danger that this bubble will become even tighter. Just being lukewarm and lax about increasing pressure leads to encapsulation. A clear announcement could lead to the fact that even opponents of vaccination who are actually walled off will eventually get vaccinated and then subsequently change their convictions,\" Wagner believes. Changing one's mind and defending it against the group is very difficult, he says. Compulsory vaccination would bring \"a new argument into play, both for one's own conviction and against the group. \"The external compulsion would be an excuse.\"\n\n+++\n\n22.11.2021: Biontech founder: vaccine protection still very high after 9 months\n\nBerlin (dpa) - According to company founder Ugur Sahin, the protection against a severe corona disease is very high for the Biontech vaccine up to the ninth month. This was shown by recently published studies, Sahin told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag. However, the vaccination protection starts to decrease \"from the fourth month\". Sahin therefore advocated booster vaccinations. \"On the one hand, a booster protects the vaccinated person very well against illness, but it also helps to break further chains of infection.\" This could help us through the upcoming difficult winter.\n\n+++\n\n21.11.2021: Belgium and most of the Netherlands now high-risk areas\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Due to a sharp rise in the number of infections, Belgium and a large part of the Netherlands have been classified as Corona high-risk areas since Sunday. Greece, which is popular with holidaymakers, and Ireland also fall into this category according to a classification by the Federal Government. Anyone entering from a high-risk area who has not been fully vaccinated or has not recovered must be quarantined for ten days and can be exempted from this at the earliest five days after entry with a negative test.\n\n+++\n\n20.11.2021: Bavaria: Tough corona countermeasures\n\nMunich (dpa) - Bavaria is reacting with tough countermeasures to the rising corona infection figures: Starting next Wednesday (24 November), strict contact restrictions will apply to unvaccinated people. Only a maximum of five people from two households will be allowed to meet - only children under 12 will not be counted, nor will vaccinated persons.\n\nAll clubs, discos and bars will have to close for the next three weeks, and there will be no Christmas markets this year. Cultural and sporting events will only be allowed to take place on a much smaller scale: with a maximum capacity of 25 per cent of spectators and with compulsory testing even for vaccinated persons. In extreme hotspots, large parts of public life will also be shut down. Schools and day-care centres, however, are to remain open throughout Bavaria.\n\n+++\n\n09.11.2021: Possible new government coalition plans 3G in the workplace\n\nBerlin (dpa) - A return to free Corona rapid tests, 3G (vaccinated, recovered, tested) at the workplace and financial aid for clinics are intended to curb the drastically rising Corona numbers. This was announced in Berlin by representatives of the possible new government coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP. At the same time, the previous legal basis for drastic Corona restrictions is to expire despite the worsening Corona situation.\n\n+++\n\n08.11.2021: Highest incidence since the beginning of the pandemic\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The 7-day incidence of new infections has reached its highest level since the start of the Corona pandemic. The Robert Koch Institute reported the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week at 201.1 on Monday morning. The previous record value was reached at the peak of the second Corona wave on 22.12.2020 with 197.6.\n\n+++\n\n07.11.2021: Karliczek praises drug research\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Acting Federal Research Minister Anja Karliczek has welcomed the latest success stories in the field of anti-covid drugs. In addition to vaccination, safe and effective therapeutics are crucial to be able to cope with the pandemic, the CDU politician told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur. \"The reports from Pfizer on the application for approval and Merck & Co. on the successful approval of their Covid-19 drugs are therefore good news for all of us.\" Pharmaceutical company Pfizer had reported that it had an effective pill in the fight against the Corona pandemic that was very successful in preventing severe disease progression in high-risk patients. An interim analysis of test results had shown that the drug reduced the risk of hospital admissions and deaths in Covid 19 patients by 89 per cent. Previously, the UK Medicines Agency had approved a tablet developed by pharmaceutical companies Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Merck to treat Covid-19. The antiviral is safe and effective in reducing the risk of hospital admissions and deaths in covid patients with mild and moderate courses, a UK government statement said. Karliczek pointed out that the Ministry of Research was advancing drug research against Covid-19 with several funding measures and strengthening companies in the development of their drugs.\n\n+++\n\n06.11.2021: Ethics Council Vice-Chairman in favour of compulsory vaccination for some groups\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In view of rising corona infection figures, the deputy head of the German Ethics Council, Julian Nida-Rümelin, has spoken out in favour of introducing compulsory vaccination for certain groups. For example, for medical staff and teachers, or from a certain age, compulsory vaccinations would be \"ethically justified in view of the numbers\", Nida-Rümelin said in a podcast of the \"Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger\" and the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND). Nida-Rümelin is a German philosopher. Under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, he was Minister of State for Culture.\n\n+++\n\n05.11.2021: Corona booster vaccinations for all\n\nLindau (dpa) - In view of the worsened Corona situation in many regions of Germany, the federal and state governments want to make booster vaccinations possible for all vaccinated persons after six months. To this end, the federal states envisage, among other things, vaccination buses and vaccination centres, said Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) after a meeting of the federal and state ministers in Lindau on Friday. Doctors in private practice would also be involved in booster vaccinations. \"Boosters after six months should become the rule - not the exception.\" He said this was particularly true for the elderly and the staff of nursing and health care facilities.\n\n+++\n\n04.11.2021: Record high in new corona infections\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The number of new daily infections with the corona virus has risen to a record level in Germany. Health authorities reported a total of 33,949 new corona infections to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) within one day, as the RKI announced on Thursday. A week ago, the figure was 28,037 infections. The previous record was 33,777 cases on 18 December 2020. The nationwide seven-day incidence - the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within one week - is now 154.5.\n\n+++\n\n03.11.2021: Stricter Corona rules in some federal states\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In view of the tense Corona situation, some federal states in Germany are tightening measures to contain the pandemic. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, stricter rules apply from Wednesday for people without a Corona vaccination: anyone who has not been vaccinated or has recovered must show an expensive PCR test for numerous leisure activities in enclosed spaces - for example in restaurants, cinemas, swimming pools, museums or canteens. Tighter regulations are also planned in Bavaria and Saxony. In Bavaria, among other things, the compulsory wearing of masks by pupils in class is to be reintroduced.\n\n+++\n\n02.11.2021: Bundeswehr flies Corona patients from Romania to Germany\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The Bundeswehr is flying seriously ill Corona patients from Romania to Germany for treatment. For this purpose, an Airbus A310 of the German Air Force landed in Bucharest on Monday, the Bundeswehr Medical Service wrote on Twitter. A total of six patients were to be brought to Germany by air. Only just under a third of Romanians are fully vaccinated, according to the EU health authority. The 14-day incidence of new infections recently rose to over 1000 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the EU.\n\n+++\n\n01.11.2021: Phone calls shorter again after Corona high\n\nMunich (dpa) - After people made phone calls significantly longer than before in the first Corona year, some normality is now returning. In August and September, a mobile phone call in the O2 network lasted on average about 2 minutes and 40 seconds, the network operator Telefónica announced. In contrast, in the various lockdown months since the start of the pandemic, callers were on the phone 30 to 60 seconds longer. The reason for this: Because of the Corona restrictions, citizens were less on the move and no longer met friends or family on the spot, but made phone calls to them.\n\n+++\n\n31.10.2021: Corona levels higher than a year ago\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The nationwide seven-day incidence has again risen significantly. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reported the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants and week at 145.1 on Saturday. For comparison: A year ago, the value was 104.9. The health offices in Germany reported 21,543 new corona infections to the RKI within one day. This figure was 18,681 a year ago.\n\n+++\n\n30.10.2021: Two thirds of Germans vaccinated against Corona\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The vaccination rate in Germany has reached the two-thirds mark: according to data from the Robert Koch Institute, 66.6 per cent of the population have now been fully vaccinated against the corona virus. There are still considerable regional differences in the current status of Covid 19 vaccinations: While 78.1 per cent of people in Bremen have complete vaccination protection, the figure in Saxony is 56.6 per cent. Meanwhile, 41.2 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds nationwide have already been vaccinated against Corona. No vaccine has yet been approved for younger children. Meanwhile, the nationwide seven-day incidence is 145.1, significantly higher than a year ago.\n\n+++\n\n29.10.2021: Labour market defies pandemic\n\nNuremberg (dpa) - The number of unemployed in Germany fell sharply to 2.377 million in October thanks to a continuing autumn revival, according to the Federal Employment Agency in Nuremberg. The unemployment rate thus stands at 5.2 per cent. \"Unemployment and underemployment are falling sharply, employment and corporate demand for new staff are increasing, and short-time work continues to decline,\" said Detlef Scheele, head of the Federal Agency's Executive Board.\n\n+++\n\n28.10.2021: Corona restrictions to be phased out gradually\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The SPD, Greens and FDP want to phase out the legal basis for drastic Corona restrictions such as curfews by 25 November. According to the will of the possible coalition partners of a future federal government, the \"epidemic situation of national scope\" should end after about 20 months. Until spring, however, the federal states are to be allowed to set less comprehensive guidelines. By 20 March at the latest, there should be an end to all Corona restrictions.\n\n+++\n\n27.10.2021: Medical consultations via video consultation increase strongly\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In the Corona crisis, medical consultations via video consultation have increased strongly. In the first half of 2021, there were more than 2.25 million such digital contacts at the practices of doctors and psychotherapists, according to an evaluation by the Zentralinstitut für die kassenärztliche Versorgung. Before the pandemic, no 4,000 video consultation hours had been billed in the whole of 2019.\n\n+++\n\n26.10.2021: Experts call for more speed in booster vaccinations\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In view of rising incidences of corona, experts have called for more third-party vaccinations against covid-19 in the elderly and risk groups. The so-called booster vaccinations can usually be administered six months after the second prick so that further antibodies are formed. \"Booster vaccinations for vulnerable groups are urgently needed, especially in view of the rising numbers,\" Dirk Heinrich, Federal Chairman of the Virchowbund der niedergelassenen Ärzte, told the \"Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung\".\n\n+++\n\n25.10.2021: Stiko head rejects Kimmich's vaccination concerns\n\nBerlin (dpa) - The chairman of the Standing Commission on Vaccination (Stiko), Thomas Mertens, has dismissed the concerns of national football player Joshua Kimmich about the lack of long-term studies on vaccines. \"In addition to the approval studies, we know from the accompanying studies that there have only been a few side effects, all of which occurred quite shortly after vaccination,\" said the Stiko head. The scientific community agrees that side effects occurring late after a vaccination \"do not occur, or are an extremely rare rarity with individual vaccines\". The FC Bayern Munich player admitted at the weekend that he had not yet been vaccinated. He still has \"a few personal reservations, especially with regard to the lack of long-term studies\".\n\n+++\n\n24.10.2021: Pandemic control at the centre of the World Health Summit in Berlin\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Lessons learned from the Corona pandemic are the topic of the World Health Summit, which begins today and takes place in Berlin and online. The annual meeting at the Charité University Hospital is considered one of the most important international forums for global health issues. Since 2009, it annually brings together around 2,000 internationally renowned representatives from science, business, politics and civil society to discuss the most urgent tasks of global health care. Until Tuesday, speeches are expected from UN Secretary-General António Guterres, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Biontech founder Özlem Türeci, among others.\n\n+++\n\n23.10.2021: Corona incidence in triple digits for the first time since May\n\nBerlin (dpa) - For the first time since mid-May, the seven-day incidence in Germany has reached 100.

Safety concerns or unknown side effects have not been observed, the Mainz-based company and its US partner said, citing a series of studies involving more than 10,000 participants. \"These important data add to the existing body of knowledge and show that booster vaccinations can help protect large segments of the population from this virus and its variants,\" said Biontech CEO Ugur Sahin.\n\n+++\n\n21.10.2021: New agreement between Biontech and Novartis\n\nBasel (dpa) - Pharmaceutical group Novartis and biotech company Biontech have signed a new production agreement. According to Novartis, the filling and finishing of Pfizer-Biontech's Corona vaccine will be expanded.

In consultations with the health ministers of the federal states, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn argued that the so-called epidemic situation of national scope should not be extended again. This would mean that it would expire on 25 November. The epidemic situation is the basis for regulations and central Corona measures in Germany. It was first established by the Bundestag in March 2020 and later extended several times by parliament. Health Minister Spahn's move met with mixed reactions.\n\n+++\n\n19.10.2021: EU exports one billion Corona vaccine doses\n\nBrussels (dpa ) - The European Union has exported more than one billion Corona vaccine doses to other countries around the world within ten months. \"We have reached an important milestone,\" said Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. The vaccine has been delivered to more than 150 countries since December 2020, she said. Some 87 million doses had gone to low- and middle-income countries through the UN Covax initiative. \"We have always shared our vaccines fairly with the rest of the world,\" von der Leyen stressed.\n\n+++\n\n18.10.2021: Exhibition on the Corona distance\n\nMainz (dpa ) - An exhibition in Mainz is dedicated to the question of how the Corona minimum distance of 1.50 metres has influenced society. In the Kunsthalle in the capital of Rhineland-Palatinate, the works of nine artists and collectives are on display in the show \"Eins Komma Fünf\" (one comma five) until the beginning of January.

Chair Alena Buyx told Focus magazine that the aim was not an \"accusatory stocktaking\" but rather a \"critical outlook\". For example, she said, the paper was to adress questions like: \"What criteria could be used in the future to ensure faster and more precise risk assessments and balancing of interests?\" The review was also intended as a contribution to \"a kind of public healing process\" that could counteract the increasing polarisation caused by the pandemic.\n\n+++\n\n16.10.2021: Biontech and Pfizer apply for approval of vaccine for children\n\nMainz (dpa) - The Mainz-based pharmaceutical company Biontech and its US partner Pfizer have now applied for approval of their corona vaccine for children aged five to eleven in Europe. Both announced in Mainz and New York on Friday that they had submitted the relevant data on the clinical trials to the EU medicines agency EMA.\n\nThe same data had already been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There, Biontech and Pfizer had applied for emergency approval of the corona vaccine for children aged five to eleven on 7 October.\n\nAccording to Biontech and Pfizer, the clinical studies show that the vaccine is well tolerated by children in this age group and produces a stable immune response. Unlike adolescents, children in this age group were given only one-third of the dose. According to the companies, a total of 4500 children aged six months to eleven years took part in the study; the data on the five to eleven year olds were based on 2268 participants. More than 90 clinics in the USA, Finland, Poland and Spain were involved.\n\n+++\n\n11.10.2021: Corona rapid tests to be paid for by the patient\n\nBerlin (dpa) In Germany, the Corona quick tests, which have been free of charge for all citizens since spring, must now mostly be paid for by the citizens themselves. Generally, they remain free for people who cannot be vaccinated, including children under the age of twelve. However, the regulation that came into force on Monday also lays down some transitional rules: for example, children aged 12 to 17 and pregnant women can still take at least one free test per week until 31 December.\n\n+++\n\n10.10.2021: Germany has donated more than 13 million vaccine doses\n\nAccording to the German Federal Foreign Office, Germany has donated more than 13 million Corona vaccine doses to other countries. According to the report, 13,001,280 doses were delivered to 15 countries. 7.3 million of these were delivered bilaterally and 5.7 million vaccine doses via the international vaccination alliance Covax.

This is shown by the results of a series of Germany-wide representative surveys conducted by the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) on corona vaccination in Germany (CoSiD study). 81 percent see vaccination as a communal task against the spread of Covid-19. However, especially in the group of the unvaccinated without a willingness to be vaccinated, confidence in the safety of a Corona vaccination is only low, according to the study.\n\n+++\n\n08.10.2021: Ministers of Education: Schools should remain open\n\nPotsdam(dpa) - Even if the Corona situation in Germany worsens in autumn and winter, schools should not close again. This is what the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder are advocating. It is \"indispensable to keep the schools open and to secure the presence of classes in the long term\", according to a resolution passed by the ministers after consultations in Potsdam.\n\n+++\n\n07.10.2021: Corona tears holes in budgets, but revenues rise again\n\nWiesbaden (dpa) - The Corona pandemic has torn holes in state budgets. According to the Federal Statistical Office, expenditure of the so-called general public budget was 10.8 percent higher in the first half of 2021 than in the first half of 2020, amounting to 883.2 billion euros, the office reported on Thursday. \"The increased expenditure of the general public budget can mainly be explained by increased allocations and grants as a result of the Corona pandemic,\" the Wiesbaden-based statisticians explained. These included, for example, aid to businesses or support for hospitals. Revenues rose by 6.0 per cent to 752.1 billion euros in the first half of 2021. Revenues from taxes and levies had declined significantly in the first half of 2020 - in the meantime, they have returned to the pre-pandemic level, according to the Federal Statistical Office. In total, however, there is a financing deficit of 131.1 billion euros for the first half of 2021.\n\n+++\n\n06.10.2021: Corona and flu wave feared\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In its latest weekly report, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has predicted an increase in the number of Corona cases in autumn and winter. The RKI cited as reasons that there are still a large number of unvaccinated people and that indoor contacts increase in autumn. In addition, doctors fear a wave of influenza. Currently, there is already an accumulation of respiratory infections among minors. Doctors report that infections are now being caught up on, which did not occur last winter and spring due to the partial lockdown.\n\n+++\n\n05.10.2021: Corona crisis makes paper more expensive\n\nFrankfurt/Bonn (dpa) - Paper has become considerably more expensive. And short-notice orders for special graphic papers and cardboard for bindings have become more difficult, reports the German Publishers & Booksellers Association. This is putting Germany's book and newspaper publishers under pressure. The price increase is due to higher costs for energy and transport, but also to the Corona crisis: because more and more paper mills have switched their production from graphic papers to cardboard, which is in demand because of the booming online trade.\n\n+++\n\n04.10.2021: Lufthansa in favour of compulsory employee vaccination\n\nNew York/Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Under pressure from government requirements, more and more US airlines are obliging their employees to have Corona vaccinations. Lufthansa, too, wants to have its flight personnel fully vaccinated against Corona, but cannot rely on compulsory vaccination. Lufthansa board member Detlef Kayser affirmed in the \"Bild am Sonntag\" that \"as a globally operating airline, we are in favour of mandatory vaccination for our crews and also need a way to record the vaccination data.\" In Lufthansa's view, otherwise a stable, worldwide flight operation will not be feasible in the future. Individual countries already require the vaccination for pilots, flight attendants and flight attendants, and others would follow.\n\n+++\n\n03.10.2021: One Million Visitors at Munich's Wirtshauswiesn\n\nMunich (dpa) - The Wirtshauswiesn in Munich has come to an end after 16 days. A good one million visitors took part in the event, as Gregor Lemke, spokesman for the association of Munich city centre innkeepers, summed it up on Sunday. Because the Oktoberfest had to be cancelled for the second year in a row due to the Corona pandemic, 51 inns and beer gardens invited visitors to the Wirtshauswiesn, where dirndls and lederhosen, music, Wiesn beer, gingerbread hearts and ox on the spit were supposed to create Oktoberfest flair. Due to the positive response, the Wirtshauswiesn is to take place again next year - even if there is an Oktoberfest again.\n\n+++\n\n02.10.2021: Steinmeier awards Order of Merit\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany to people who rendered outstanding services to art and culture during the Corona pandemic. The pandemic had made people aware of the importance of art and culture. The Corona crisis had hit all those who work for culture \"particularly hard\", said the Federal President.\n\nThe organiser Petra Schubert, for example, who organised classical concerts for senior citizens in nursing homes during the pandemic, and the President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, received an order for his commitment \"against prejudice, ignorance, hatred and violence\".\n\n+++\n\n01.10.2021: RKI expects Corona increase for autumn and winter\n\nBerlin (dpa) - In the Corona pandemic, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) expects an increase in the number of infections again for autumn and winter. This is what the Institute writes in its weekly report of Thursday evening.

The trend is driven by optimism about income prospects and a positive assessment of the economic situation, GfK reported. However, consumer sentiment is still strongly influenced by the continuation of the Corona pandemic, the consumer researchers summed up.\n\n+++\n\n29.09.2021: Almost three quarters of adults in Germany fully vaccinated\n\nBerlin (dpa) - Almost three-quarters of adults and one-third of children between the ages of 12 and 17 have now been fully vaccinated against Corona in Germany.
