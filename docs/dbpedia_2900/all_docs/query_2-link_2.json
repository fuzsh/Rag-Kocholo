        "text": "The BfC is the central point of contact for industry, policymakers, and other public bodies in Germany when it comes to questions about chemicals regulation. Its duties are anchored in German law by the Chemicals Act (Chemikaliengesetz), while the European framework for its work is laid down by the applicable EU regulations.\n\nBAuA collaborates closely on chemicals regulation processes with the other federal institutions responsible for this field. They include the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz, nukleare Sicherheit und Verbraucherschutz, BMUV), the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung, BfR), and the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA).\n\nEvaluate, regulate, authorise: the Federal Office for Chemicals performs diverse tasks relating to the regulation of chemicals and biocides, a domain strongly shaped by EU law. Issue 01/2024 of baua: Aktuell (German) gives insights into BAuA’s role and various duties overseeing the health and environmental protection aspects of the handling of hazardous substances.\n\nThe BfC summarises the overall position arrived at by the German authorities in the course of their evaluation processes and communicates it to international institutions – including the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the European Commission. In its capacity as the “occupational health and safety assessment office”, BAuA leverages its expertise in occupational safety and health to support the processes that are conducted.\n\nOne important building block in the BfC’s work is the REACH-CLP-Biocides Helpdesk, which provides advice through multiple channels, responding to inquiries, publishing brochures, and holding events. This allows it to offer a high degree of support to manufacturers, importers, and users of chemicals and biocidal products."
