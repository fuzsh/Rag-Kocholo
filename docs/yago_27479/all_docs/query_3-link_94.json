        "text": "The Reagans are most closely associated with the state of California â but the former first lady was actually born here in the city. Queens Borough Reporter Ruschell Boone has more on Nancy Reagan's earliest years.\n\nLong before she called the White House home, before her marriage to Ronald Reagan, before her career as a Hollywood actress â Nancy Reagan lived in aÂ modest, two-story home in Flushing,Â Queens\n\n\"Wow,\" said one neighbor. \"I didn't even know it. I'm 25 years here at this location and I didn't realize.\"\n\nThere are no markers or signs, and a day after her death, there were no flowers or candlesÂ âÂ just a trickle of visitors who stopped to gaze at the house at 149-40 Roosevelt Avenue.\n\n\"I was just passing by and I thought that I would take a photo,\" said one.\n\nNancy Reagan livedÂ in the house for the first two years of her life, beginning in 1921.\n\nShe was Anne Frances Robbins then;Â the name Nancy would come later. This street had a different name too, Amity Street.\n\nIt was renamed in 1922Â for President Theodore Roosevelt. It's part ofÂ aÂ largely immigrant community now, and many on the blockÂ had no idea Monday about it'sÂ linkÂ to political royalty.\n\nBut oneÂ longtimeÂ resident didÂ âÂ Jimmy Charalambous, aÂ barber in the neighborhoodÂ for 54 years.\n\n\"She was a good lady,\" Charalambous said. \"Beautiful lady.\"\n\nThe home's connection to Nancy Reagan was detailed in Kitty Kelly's 1991 biography of the former first lady.Â Nancy Reagan's death put a new spotlight on the home'sÂ past.\n\nOne of the visitors MondayÂ âÂ aÂ woman whoÂ says she volunteered in one of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns and served asÂ a White House intern under PresidentÂ George H.W. Bush.Â\n\n\"I was always a big fan of Nancy Reagan and her red dresses, and you know the Reagans and their economic policies so I just had no idea she was born right here,\" she said.\n\nThe home, empty for years, Â is now owned by a couple in Auburndale, Queens, records show. The ownersÂ could not be reached for comment Monday.\n\nWhen aÂ NY1 reporterÂ came by, a man appeared to be sleeping on the porch, in a box. \"I'm a guard for the house,\" he claimed.\n\nNancy Reagan moved away in 1923,Â eventually to Chicago andÂ college in Massachusetts, thenÂ on to California and, of course,Â to Washington, where she spent eight years in the White House â a remarkable journey that began in aÂ small house in Flushing so many yearsÂ ago."
