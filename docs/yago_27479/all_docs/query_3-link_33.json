        "text": "1 / 13\n\nRonald Reagan started off as more of a playboy—married once and spending much of his time as an actor in Hollywood cavorting with young starlets. But in 1949, after he became president of the Screen Actors Guild, he was contacted by a mutual friend on behalf of Nancy Davis—as Nancy Reagan was known then—an actress who had briefly dated Clark Gable and starred in films like The Next Voice You Hear . . . and Night Into Morning. Davis had persuaded her friend to call Reagan on her behalf because her name had been linked to Hollywood’s blacklist of suspected communist sympathizers—apparently, there was another actress with the same moniker and she wanted Reagan to help clear things up. Ronald and Nancy met for the first time for dinner and fell for each other almost instantly.\n\nIn 1952, Reagan proposed with a simple “let’s get married,” to which she replied, “Let’s.” They were married at Little Brown Church in L.A. that same year on March 4, and seven months after, their first child was born. From there, their American love story played out like a film they might have once auditioned for. And after Reagan became president in 1981, their relationship began to play out in public. She was “Ronnie’s” right hand in all matters of work and in life, and he was her doting, adoring husband. They’d often write love letters to each other, and Nancy eventually published them in a book in 2000 titled I Love You, Ronnie.\n\nToday, as Nancy is laid to rest after passing last weekend at the age of 94, she’s joining her husband again somewhere, arm in arm, looking at him with the famous adoring gaze that, throughout their time in the White House, always brought a little heartwarming passion into tough politics.\n\nAbove, a look back at the early days of Ronnie and Nancy, from their courtship to their wedding day and the beginnings of a marriage that would last 52 years.\n\nWatch Vogue.com’s most popular videos now:"
