Nancy Reagan, wife of former President Ronald Reagan, passed away at age 94 in her Bel Air, California, home on Sunday. Representatives said the cause of death was congestive heart failure.

Born Ann Francis Robbins on July 6, 1921 in New York City, Mrs. Reagan attended Smith College before pursuing an acting career â€” first on Broadway and later in Hollywood in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. It was in Hollywood, where she met her future husband, fellow actor Ronald Reagan. The couple married in 1952 and had two children together. They were married until Ronald's death in 2004.

As President Reagan's focus shifted from acting to politics, his wife was always his biggest supporter and advocate. She became the first lady of California after her husband was elected governor in 1966. Then she became first lady of the United States in 1981, working by his side at the White House as a hostess and proponent of her own causes. During her time as first lady, Mrs. Reagan famously spearheaded a "Just Say No" campaign against drug abuse. In later years, she advocated in favor of stem cell research and for American veterans.

"Mrs. Reagan will be buried at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, next to her husband, Ronald Wilson Reagan, who died on June 5, 2004," Reagan spokesperson Joanne Drake said in a statement to NBC News. She is survived by two children, Ron Reagan and Patti Davis.
