See Page 2 With Office 2010 just released, Sam tells us where we can get a copy and at a very reasonable price, and if you've just updated to Windows 7, you might want to bring back some XP menus - if so, Sam tells you how. See page 4 Ted's got some good advise on what to do if your snags catch fire on the kitchen stove and if you're an old codger like he is and you're over 60, you should join the Seniors' Club. Ted tells you how. See page 6 Page 1 We've got our lovely Page 3 girl again, and some photos of courses from long ago, plus a photo of some old Phan Rang war horses. See page 3 We have the results of our TV survey, and John Mackesy tells us about his pet 618T. And, if you like music where you can understand the words and sing them aloud in public, then that authority on old stuff, Laurie Lindsay, has just the site for you. See page 5 Gary Kimberley tells us his story, and shares his experiences living and working in Vung Tau where he had many memorable moments flying the Caribou. See page 7"
