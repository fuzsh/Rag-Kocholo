        "text": "Short statement:\n\nDr Paul Benneworth is a senior researcher at the Center for Higher Education Policy Studies, the University of Twente, the Netherlands, and also at Agderforskning, Kristiansand, Norway. Paul’s research interests are related to the relationships between universities and societal change with a particular focus on social sciences and humanities research, as well as societal change in old industrial regions. Paul’s Ph.D. explored the ways that old industrial regions create new opportunities for economic development through the ways that their existing industries and technologies are cross-fertilised within wider global networks in ways that drive various kinds of modernisation processes, economic, social, political, institutional, and environmental. In 2010-13 he was Chief Scientist of the Humanities in the European Research Area ERANET network Joint Research Programme “The public value of arts & humanities research”. Paul has undertaken a wider range of basic and applied research activities for a variety of funders including research councils, HE funding councils, the OECD, government departments across Europe, the European Commission and a number of regional authorities. He is one of the authors of “The Impact and Future of Arts & humanities research” (2016, forthcoming, Palgrave).\n\nShort statement:\n\nJosé Gabriel Andrade holds a European PhD in Communication Sciences from the Catholic University of Portugal and a Master in Communication Sciences: Communication, Organisation and New Technologies from the Portuguese Catholic University with the support of the high level Scholarship Programme of the European Union for Latin America (Alban).

José Gabriel Andrade is assistant lecturer at the School of Philosophy and Social Sciences (FFSC) - Braga - and at the School of Human Sciences (FCH) - Lisbon - of the Catholic University of Portugal (UCP); researcher at the Research Center for Philosophical and Humanistic Studies (CEFH, UCP) in the area of Communication, Media and Audience; researcher at the Research Centre for Communication and Culture (CECC, UCP) in the area of Media, Technology, Contexts; and visiting researcher at the Brazil Institute of King's College - London.\n\nShort statement:\n\nFollowing a degree in Medical Cell Biology, Kate moved into the world of science and technology policy, taking a Masters degree at the University of Manchester and staying as a researcher at PREST (Programme of Policy Research in Engineering, Science and Technology). Early work involved the development of research evaluation systems for government research laboratories and programmes, as evaluation began to be introduced in research organisations and programmes in the 1980s. She worked on early evaluations for the European Commission’s Framework programmes, for example the socio-economic impacts of ICT and telematics collaborative R&D.\n\nPREST transformed into the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research in 2004, when Kate became a senior lecturer. She has recently worked on the interactions of firms with physics-based large scale research infrastructures, and the societal impacts of ICT research, developing the SIAMPI framework (societal impact assessment measured through productive interactions). Within the ERA-LEARN project, Kate is contributing to the development of frameworks for mapping the impacts of ERA-nets and Joint Programming Initiatives. Recently she has been working on models of impact in a different domain, namely the impacts of social enterprises and community-based funding instruments for community organisations.\n\nShort statement:\n\nRok Benčin (born 1984) is an Assistant Professor at Postgraduate School ZRC SAZU and a Research Fellow at the Institute of Philosophy at the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Her doctoral research project, undertaken at the University of Exeter, UK was entitled “Articulations of Value in the Humanities: The Contemporary Neoliberal University and Our Victorian Inheritance”. Her thesis traced the shift from liberal to neoliberal education from the nineteenth century to the present day, in order to provide a rich and previously underdeveloped narrative of value in the humanities. Rather than attempting to justify the value of the humanities within presiding economic frameworks or writing a defence against market rationalism, her thesis offered an original contribution through an immersion in social, financial, and literary debates concerning contemporary educational policy.\n\nZoe's research specialism lies in nineteenth- to twenty-first-century novels concerning economics and education, alongside critical theory that addresses socio-economic, policy-oriented, historicist, and aesthetic values. Her work places contemporary cultures of “crisis” within a historical perspective in order to develop a nuanced articulation of contemporary culture and the value of the humanities.\n\nZoe has published research in Palgrave Communications (Vol. 3.1) and is currently working on her first monograph which will explore the means and methods with which to value humanities research in the UK under the present funding and policy climates.\n\nShort statement:\n\nMarc Caball is cultural historian and has published widely in the area of early modern cultural history.

In this work he has investigated the national (Belgian) and European policies and management prescriptions which directly or indirectly - have an impact on the (re)definition of quality when assessing the publications in SSH, and confronted those “supra-collegial” prescriptions with the quality criteria that the researchers themselves would like to see (better) valorized in the assessment of their research and publications. Vanholsbeeck is also a part time lecturer in qualitative methodologies and science communication at the department of communication studies of the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Furthermore, as his current principal professional activity, he is heading a team in charge of following the European Research Area at the Direction of scientific research of the Ministry of Wallonia-Brussels Federation (= French speaking Community of Belgium), with a specific expertise in SSH research, social innovation and Open Science. Marc intends to pursue in the future his investigation of the impact of research policies and management practices on scholarly and science communication, with a specific focus on the SSH.\n\nShort statement:\n\nAfter his degrees in agricultural economics, German-Hungarian translation and international MBA studies, he completed his PhD at Szent Istvan University, Hungary.

She approaches issues related to university governance and academic identity in an empirical framework inspired by linguistic pragmatics and Foucauldian governmentality. Her work contributes to the fields of Social Theory, Applied Linguistics and Higher Education Studies.\n\nMarta’s doctorate in the area of Applied Linguistics focuses on the changes in academic discourse related to the introduction of the Impact Agenda – a new element of assessing academic research, launched with Research Excellence Framework in 2014. Specifically, the thesis explores changes in self-presentation of academics in text (studied on the basis of case studies submitted to REF 2014) and talk (investigated through reflexive interviews). The work argues that the introduction of a new element of academic reality and academic discourse was facilitated by the creation of an ‚impact infrastructure’ (a type of ‚dispositif’) built around a new genre of academic writing – impact case study.\n\nMarta is the author of the two existing publications on research evaluation in Polish (published in Nauka i Szkolnictwo Wyższe). Between 2014-2018 she was member of the ERC-funded DISCONEX project on the ‚Discursive construction of academic excellence’, based at University of Warwick and EHESS, Paris. She is also member of a network of discourse researchers DiscourseNet."
