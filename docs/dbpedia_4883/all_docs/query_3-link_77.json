        "text": "Old habits die hard.\n\nOne of those old habits for me is waking up and checking the news before even getting out of bed. A long time ago that meant turning on the radio.\n\nNow it means moving through a number of news sites on the phone. I need to see what happened overnight.\n\nSo this morning, the 27th of August 2024, that is what I did.\n\nTop of the page stories in the NY Times concerned hostage rescue in Gaza, Russia hammers Ukraine, Harris polling numbers bounce. The Washington Post led with Chinese hackers, the hostage story and cellphone bans in schools. The Guardian US liked stories on Trump supporters attack Walz’s personal history and other US election news. The Guardian UK went with Unite criticisms Starmer, and the Russia/Ukraine war.\n\nThe SF Chronicle, supposedly the “paper of record” for the town I live in, is never at the top of my list for a quick look. Traditionally the paper can be a bit shallow. It once had an unoffical newsroom motto,, “If it’s news to you, it’s news to us”. I am sure the scribblers got the irony.\n\nBut check it I did this morning. In a town facing housing and economic issues, a hot four way race for mayor, drugs and health problems, and budget issues, the Chronicle’s top story, occupying the most import spot, on a phone screen the top of the page, and on a large screen the upper left, is a exhaustive series of articles on the San Francisco classic eatery, the “House of Prime Rib”.\n\nIn an effort to leave no stone unturned there are follow on pieces exploring: How hard it is to get a reservation. How to get in without a reservation. What does your order say about your personality? What is best to order, and what is the best appetizer?\n\nThere is no mention of the “House” shuttering its doors to bust the union that once represented the workers.\n\nHere is a list of unionized eateries in San Francisco and the bay area.\n\nThe 2008 presidential election delivered a result I never thought would happen in my life time - Barack Obama, a Black man, was elected President. I had to go to his inauguration, and I did. It was an amazing event on an unbelievably cold day,\n\nEight years later the presidential election was between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Donald Trump won. I thought his election was, for different reasons than Obama’s, was historic, and so I went to his inauguration.\n\nThe differences were stark: At one, huge crowds, happy, joyous people of all ages, genders and ethnicity, full of hope and faith in the future, excited to be there. At the other, Trump’s, a crowd about a third the size of mostly white people, looking unconnected to each other and the event.\n\nThis week I have put up on the the site “A Tale of Two Inaugurations”. Take a look.\n\n.\n\nRead of the week\n\n“C L R James and America: The brilliant Trinidadian thinker is remembered as an admirer of the US but he also warned of its dark political future” In AEON, by Harvey Neptune. Edited by Sam Haselby\n\n.\n\nFrom San Francisco’s St. Mary’s Pub, a bar Napkin from the 1950s"
