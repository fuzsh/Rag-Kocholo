        "text": "Hey, I hope you’re keeping safe and well. I feel like I just finished July’s post and now it’s the end of August. There are a few more covers from earlier in the year in this month’s post. I’m still catching up. But there’s some Canadian content, a few covers from the UK, some indie presses, and a university press, which is always nice. Enjoy the last few weeks of summer!\n\n1974 by Francine Prose; design by High Tide (Harper / June 2024)\n\nThanks to Robin Bilardello and AD Milan Bozic at Harper for their help on the credit for this one! :-)\n\nAnyone’s Ghost by August Thompson; design by Keith Hayes (Penguin Press / July 2024)\n\nThis was published last month, but I had it in my August folder. If I had to guess it was because of the author’s name. I am easily confused.\n\nThe Buddha of Suburbia by Hanif Kureishi; design by Kishan Rajani (Faber / July? 2024)\n\nI think this came out in July too, but it looks like Faber used the ISBN of the existing 2017 edition even though there is a new cover so I don’t know for sure when it was updated (publishers: don’t do this).\n\nBurn by Peter Heller; design Kelly Blair; painting ‘Boat Building in Maine’ (detail) by Paul Dougherty (Knopf / August 2024)\n\nCoexistence by Billy Ray Belcourt; design by Kelly Hill; photography by Steven Beckly (Hamish Hamilton Canada / May 2024)\n\nDogs and Monsters by Mark Haddon; design by Suzanne Dean; illustration by Neue Gestaltung (Vintage / August 2024)\n\nBecause I am of certain age (old and mouldering like an ancient vampire hiding from the sun of contemporary pop culture) this reminded me of the cabinet art for the original Space Invaders arcade game. Hilariously, if not surprisingly, there is a Fonts in Use post about the typography of the original promo materials and cabinet art of Space Invaders. If anyone knows of a good article about the artwork itself I would love to read it.\n\nEverything and Nothing At All by Jenny Heijun Wills; design by Terri Nimmo (Knopf Canada / August 2024)\n\nFeeding the Monster by Anna Bogutskaya; design by Henry Petrides (Faber / August 2025)\n\nSpeaking of all things retro, Henry has posted some photos of his Letraset experiments for this cover on Instagram.\n\nHair for Men by Michelle Williams; design by Greg Tabor (House of Anansi / August 2025)\n\nThere is something ‘early 2000s Canlit’ about this cover. If you’d told me this was designed for Anansi by Bill Douglas in like 2004 I would’ve believed you, and I mean that in the best way. (I appreciate that only the grizzled Canadian publishing folks like me will get this reference but hey…)\n\nLayman’s Report by Eugene Marten; design by Kate Sinclair (McClelland & Stewart / August 2024)\n\nMammoth by Eva Baltasar; design by Anna Morrison (And Other Stories / August 2025)\n\nAnna also designed the covers for two previous novels by Eva Baltasar published by AOS, including a pink special edition of Permafrost (which is possibly my favourite).\n\nMina’s Matchbox by Yoko Ogawa; design by Suzanne Dean; illustration by Gérard DuBois (Harvill Secker / August 2024)\n\nThe cover of the US edition published Pantheon this month by was designed by Tyler Comrie.\n\nThe Murmuration by Carlos Labbé; design by Anna Jordan (Open Letter / July 2024)\n\nMystery Lights by Lena Valencia; design by Beth Steidle (Tin House / August 2024)\n\nNicked by M. T. Anderson; design by Zak Tebbal (Pantheon / July 2024)\n\nIt might be time to update the now very old (10 years!) skulls post.\n\nNine Minds by Daniel Tammet; design by Louis Gabaldoni (Profile Books / July 2024)\n\nI was trying to think what this reminded me of and I think it’s either Ed Emberley’s Great Thumbprint Drawing Book or possibly the current cover of Design as Art by Bruno Munari, which (IIRC) uses drawings of faces from inside the book (but no thumbprints!).\n\nAnd, also designed by Louis…\n\nOn the Roof by Tom Allan; design by Louis Gabaldoni (Profile Books / August 2024)\n\nThis is really lovely…\n\nPlastic by Scott Guild; design by Tyler Comrie (Pantheon / February 2024)\n\nOof. I’m very late to this one.\n\nPlaything by Bea Setton; design by Beci Kelly (Transworld / June 2024)\n\nI don’t know how you would describe this particular shade — salmon pink? Financial Times pink? (Are those variations of the same thing, actually?) — but it feels like a pink covers are still a bit of thing. (Did I mention pink covers already a couple of months ago? I think I did…? Sigh. I am repeating myself. It might be time to give this up)\n\nSome White Folks by Jennifer Chudy; design by Elisha Zepeda / Faceout Studio (University of Chicago Press / July 2024)\n\nI like this cover a lot, but is the disembodied hug also becoming a thing? I think I mentioned this a while back too! (Pictured: the cover The Nursery by by Szilvia Molnar designed by Hayley Warnham from May last year, and a poster by Vasilis Marmatakis for the 2015 movie The Lobster)\n\nA Termination by Honor Moore; design by Janet Hansen (Public Space / August 2024)\n\nObviously the details of the designs and the approaches are quite different, but the cover of A Termination reminded me of the cover of Anxiety by Samir Chopra designed by Karl Spurzem for Princeton University Press from March this year. I think it’s an interesting compare and contrast?\n\nThe Wisdom of Sheep by Rosamund Young; design by Darren Haggar (Penguin Press / August 2024)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI wonder what it is like to live in uninteresting — boring, even — times? It must be nice. While I continue to ponder that, here are this month’s book covers….\n\nThe Alternatives by Caoilinn Hughes; design by Lauren Peters-Collaer (Riverhead / April 2024)\n\nBack to the Local by Maurice Gorham; design by Pete Adlington (Faber & Faber / June 2024)\n\nPete talks about the book and his process designing the cover for the Faber Journal.\n\nFestival & Game of the Worlds by César Aira; design by Tyler Comrie (New Directions / July 2024)\n\nThe Horse by Willy Vlautin; design by Milan Božić (HarperCollins / July 2024)\n\nKicking Off Around the World by Ramon Usall; design by Steve Leard (Pluto Press / June 2024)\n\nIf I was good at blogging I would have posted this last month when the book was actually published and before the finals of Euros and Copa America, but here we are. Better late than never I guess, and politics never goes out of sport however much some people pretend they are unconnected. (I’m still thinking about doing a post of covers from books about sport, but haven’t got any further than that. Again, if I was actually smart and organized, I would have had it done in time for the Olympics. Cover suggestions still welcome by the way!).\n\nAnyway… The author’s surname and the book’s subtitle were actually printed on to the shirt for the cover and Steve made or bought actual buttons to decorate it.

I feel like these work together despite being quite different? Maybe it’s as simple as the combination of really big type for the title and handwriting of “a novel”?\n\nNeu Klang by Christoph Dallach; design by Jack Smyth (Faber & Faber / May 2024)\n\nThis is out in the US/Canada next month.\n\nPaul Celan and the Trans-Tibetan Angel by Yoko Tawada; design by Jamie Keenan (New Directions / July 2024)\n\nRangikura by Tayi Tibble; design by Linda Huang; illustration by Simone Noronha (Knopf / April 2024)\n\nThe same team created the cover of Tayi Tibble’s previous poetry collection Poūkahangatus, which was included way back in September 2022’s post.\n\nThe Road to the Salt Sea by Samuel Kọláwọlé; design Alicia Tatone (Amistad Books / July 2024)\n\n(Thanks to Alicia and AD Stephen Brayda for sending over the cover)\n\nSteak by Tim Hayward; design by Luke Bird (Quadrille / May 2024)\n\nI am late to this one, but it is very good (in my defence, it only came out in the US/Canada last month).\n\nThey Dream in Gold by Mai Sennaar; design by Vivian Lopez Rowe (Zando / July 2024)\n\nTripping on Utopia by Benjamin Breen; design by Tyler Comrie (Grand Central / January 2024)\n\nI don’t who decided July is Tyler Comrie month (me, apparently), but it seems that way…\n\nTrouble in Censorville by Nadine M.

I’m a little bit ahead of schedule because fall sales conference season is upon us, and I have to be in New York for work next week. I’m less ahead than I would’ve liked — PRINT has already beaten me to the punch! — but here we are, a couple of days earlier than usual, with another look at some new and recent book covers. April is National Poetry Month in the US so there are a few poetry covers in the mix, as well as a couple of covers from independent presses, an Australian cover, and all the usual suspects.\n\nBones Worth Breaking by David Martinez; design by Alex Merto (MCD / April 2024)\n\nCharlie Hustle by Keith O’Brien; design by Eli Mock (Pantheon / March 2024)\n\nI just like the type and the colour palette here.\n\nCahokia Jazz by Francis Spufford; design by Henry Petrides (Faber & Faber / April 2024)\n\nThe Curse of Pietro Houdini by Derek B. Miller; design by David Gee (Avid Reader Press / January 2024)\n\nDivided Island by Daniela Tarazona; design by Jack Smyth (Deep Vellum / April 2024)\n\nThe Formula by Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg; design by Pete Garceau (Mariner Books / March 2024)\n\nTwo nonfiction sports books in one post! Does Formula One really count as a sport? Not for me, Clive. But the subtitle says it is, and a Canadian friend once told me that for something to qualify as a sport it has to endanger your life in some fundamental way, so I guess F1 qualifies under Quebec Rules for Teen Boys if nothing else.\n\nAnyway, it might be fun to do a post of interesting sports books covers at some point if I can find the time (let me know if any great examples come to mind!).\n\nHoney by Victor Lodata; design by Robin Bilardello (Harper / April 2023)\n\nKill For Me Kill For You by Steve Cavanagh; design by Laywan Kwan (Atria / March 2024)\n\nI feel like this is a bit different for a psychological thriller?

Look for it next time you’re in a bookstore.\n\nAlso, this cover isn’t the first to riff, consciously or otherwise, on the cut canvases of Italian artist Lucio Fontana. The cover of Ball by Tara Ison, designed by Kelly Winton, comes to mind. I’m sure there are other examples (David Gee’s unpublished cover for Lolita.

I hope you’re safe and well wherever you are.\n\nBefore we get to the covers, a couple of brief admin things. First up, there have been a couple of behind-the-scenes changes at the CO this past month. They’ve solved a few tech issues for me and hopefully no one else has noticed. Secondly, I’ve been tinkering with the RSS. I’m not sure that’s quite right yet, so apologies if it’s not been working as expected. Let me know if you’re experiencing any weirdness.\n\nI also wanted quickly mention that the deadline for the DPI mentorship scheme has been extended to April 12th. I’m not involved with the DPI, but some really great people are so if you are a designer from an under represented background living in the UK or Ireland, you should think about applying!\n\nAnyway, it’s a really big post this month! The are lots of great covers with the UK, Australia and Canada all represented, as well as the usual folks from US. There are some compare-and-contrasts, a couple of covers from indie presses, a couple of covers for translations, and a couple of poetry covers too. There’s even a meandering digression in the middle (sorry). Enjoy!\n\nAnxiety by Samir Chopra; design by Karl Spurzem (Princeton University Press / March 2024)\n\nCandy Darling by Cynthia Carr; design by Alex Merto (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / March 2024)\n\nCrisis Actor by Declan Ryan; design by Stephanie Cui (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / February 2024)\n\nFourteen Days edited by Margaret Atwood & Douglas Preston; design by Nathan Burton (Harper / February 2024)\n\nFree Therapy by Rebecca Ivory; design by Luke Bird (Vintage / March 2024)\n\nFruit of the Dead by Rachel Lyon; design by Math Monahan (Scribner / March 2024)\n\nSo this cover sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole. It reminded me of a cover design from a few years ago. It didn’t really look the same but, in my mind at least, this other cover featured a blue-red capsule shape (possibly a stretched illustration of a planet and its core) centred on a white background with black Swiss-style sans serif type. It was not exactly minimalist, but clean and precise. I think I saw it on Twitter back in the day. I thought it was maybe literary sci-fi or pop science, and published by one of the big American imprints. I was also pretty convinced that it was designed by Alex Merto or possibly John Gall. One of the dudes.\n\nThis is not the first time I have thought about this cover, and I can, or at least could, picture it quite clearly. The problem is that I can find no evidence of this cover ever existing, and the more I think about, the more the details shift and doubt creeps in. I don’t seem to have posted it anywhere, and I can’t find it in the usual places. It’s possible that I am getting some of the crucial details wrong, mentally combining a couple of covers into one, or it was something other than an actual book cover. But maybe this is some kind of Visual Mandela Effect thing, and this design that I’ve believed existed for years is actually a figment of my imagination.\n\nMy search has felt a bit like the online equivalent of walking into a bookstore and asking for the book with the blue cover. It has made realise that we have very few tools to find cover designs in a systematic way, especially since the Book Cover Archive stopped being a going concern. You just kind of have to browse and I hope you eventually look in the right place (or risk slowly lose your sanity).\n\nAnyway, if this mystery cover is ringing any bells with you, please let me know and put me out of my misery. I have been going slightly crazy. (This sort of thing happens more than I care to admit by the way, but it is particularly bad this time! And, no, I do not have much of a life.

I hope you’re safe and well. As is now the tradition, the first post of the year is a look back at some of the young adult covers of last year. The usual caveats apply of course. Not much YA crosses my desk at work, which is mostly indie publishing, and it is not a category I follow closely apart from what my kids are reading, so my insight here is limited. Still, I think at some of the stuff I wrote about the industry in my 2023 post on adult covers probably holds true for YA too. The toll of the past few years has led to a certain amount of risk aversion from both publishers and designers (albeit for different reasons), and my sense is that folks are bracing for more of the same in 2024. I would guess that genre expectations within the broader YA category have limited the room for experimentation too. Some things need to look the same it seems. But even if there is some conservatism in the current design approaches (if it ain’t broke…), and things in general feel pretty grim, there is a remarkable amount of diversity and representation on the covers of YA books — and perhaps even among the designers and illustrators themselves — and that feels like something that should be celebrated. I’ve tried my best to get all the credits for the covers, but please let me know if I missed anyone out — I’ll be happy to update the post where necessary.\n\nAll That’s Left To Say by Emery Lord; art direction by Jeanette Levy; illustration by Adele Leyris (Bloomsbury YA / July 2023)\n\nAll the Fighting Parts by Hannah V.

Add to this the ongoing concern about how artificial intelligence will affect a business historically dependent upon human creativity — yet through it all, there was still the matter of making books, and their covers, to get on with.\n\nI read Matt’s piece the same day I read an article by Kyle Chayka in the New Yorker about his search for an epochal term to “evoke the panicky incoherence of our lives of late.” The suggestions range from the bland ‘Long 2016,’ to the incredibly ominous-sounding ‘Chthulucene,’ the Lovecraftian ‘New Dark Age,’ and the frankly terrifying and plausible ‘Jackpot’ from William Gibson’s 2014 novel The Peripheral.\n\nThis was the context of life and work in 2023.\n\nMatt notes some designers found inspiration in the zeitgeist. He’s not wrong. But, ironically perhaps, I feel less optimistic about the overall picture than he does.\n\nAt the risk of repeating what I’ve written in the past couple of years, it’s like we’re stuck in a holding pattern, circling the same design ideas. Trends have stuck around. A lot of covers feel safe. Some of this was the books themselves. I’m not sure exactly how many celebrity memoirs is too many, but I’m pretty sure we reached that point and sailed right past it in 2023. No doubt some of it is sales and marketing departments sanding down all the edges and demanding the tried and true (see Zachary Petit’s alternative best of 2023 piece on killed covers for Fast Company). But I would not be surprised if it designers were just getting caught up in the churn — too many books, too many covers, and too much other stuff to worry about.\n\nOr maybe it’s just me.\n\nOne of the themes of the year was nostalgia, which I’m sure can also be put down to the present being pretty fucking awful. It was apparent across almost all genres, including literary fiction, but nowhere more so than in the resurgent supernatural suspense and horror categories. There were creative stylistic mashups with retro vibes, along side fastidious Stranger Things-like homages to the 1980s and Stephen King.\n\nOne genuinely pleasant surprise was the number of interesting covers from Canadian publishers this year. They’ve been quietly risk-averse in recent years, so it was nice to see a few bolder design choices getting approved. I was happy to see a Canadian cover was one of the top picks on Literary Hub’s (very, very long) list of the best covers of 2023.\n\nThere were other things to cheer this year too.\n\nSpine continued to give space to designers to talk about their work in a way I’ve never been able to do consistently here. You can find their 2023 cover picks here.\n\nDavid Pearson started the Book Cover Review, a website for short reviews of book covers.\n\nZoe Norvell’s I Need A Book Cover, a resource for book cover inspiration as well as place for authors and publishers to connect with designers, also went live.\n\nSteve Leard launched Cover Meeting, a podcast series of in-depth interviews with cover designers (including David and Zoe among others). As Mark Sinclair notes in his piece on book cover design this year for Creative Review, Steve’s conversations shed light on wider concerns in the industry as well as each designer’s individual process. Have a listen if you haven’t already.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nThe Adult by Bronwyn Fischer; design by Kate Sinclair (Random House Canada / May 2023)\n\nAlso designed by Kate Sinclair:\n\nThe Annual Banquet of The Gravediggers’ Guild by Mathias Énard; design by John Gall (New Directions / December 2023)\n\nI like John’s cover for Kairos by Jenny Erpenbeck, also published by New Directions, a lot too.\n\nBariloche by Andrés Neuman; design by Alban Fischer (Open Letter / March 2023)\n\nThe Bee Sting by Paul Murray; design by Na Kim (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / August 2023)\n\nAlso designed by Na Kim:\n\nBeijing Sprawl by Xu Zechen; design by Andrew Walters (Two Lines Press / June 2023)\n\nBerlin by Bea Setton; design by Emily Mahon; cover image by Nataša Denić (Penguin Books / May 2023)\n\nAlso designed by Emily Mahon:\n\nB.F.F. by Christie Tate; design by Ben Wiseman (Avid Reader Press / February 2023)\n\nBlue Hunger by Viola Di Grado; design by Myunghee Kwon (Bloomsbury / March 2023)\n\nBreaking and Entering by Don Gillmor; design by Michel Vrana; photograph by Joe Cohen (Biblioasis / August 2023)\n\nBright Young Women by Jessica Knoll; design by Kaitlin Kall (Simon & Schuster / September 2023)\n\nBrutes by Dizz Tate; design by Nicole Caputo (Catapult / February 2023)\n\nCaret, Pilcrow and Cedilla by Adam Mars-Jones; design by Jonathan Pelham (Faber / August 2023)\n\nI also really liked Jonny’s cover design for the UK edition of Tremor by Teju Cole, published by Faber.\n\nCat Prince by Michael Pedersen; design by Gray318 (Little, Brown / July 2023)\n\nThe Circle by Katherena Vermette; design by Jennifer Griffiths; art by KC Adams (Hamish Hamilton Canada / September 2023)\n\nChrysalis by Anna Metcalfe; design by Jack Smyth (Granta / May 2023)\n\nThe Complete Works of Álvaro de Campos by Fernando Pessoa; design by Peter Mendelsund (New Directions / July 2023)\n\nThe Details by Ia Genberg translated by Kira Josefsson; design Stephen Brayda; illustration Najeebah Al-Ghadban (Harpervia / August 2023)\n\nA Dictator Calls by Ismail Kadare; design by Matt Broughton (Vintage / August 2023)\n\nThe Employees by Olga Ravn; design by Paul Sahre (New Directions / February 2023)\n\nExcavations by Hannah Michell; design by Arsh Raziuddin (One World / July 2023)\n\nThe Girls’ Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank; design by Annie Atkins (Penguin / May 2023)\n\nGlaciers by Alexis M.

I hope you’re safe and well and caught up on your podcasts, shows, and TBR pile.\n\nI thought this was going to be a short post this month, and then it turned into a long one — or longer than expected at least. I don’t have too much to add to the covers. I’m busy, you’re busy. It’s almost October, literally no one has time for this! But there are some lovely covers this month. There’s a bit autumnal orange and ennui, some nice type, and a couple of Canadian covers (for those keeping count), and a couple of appropriately off-beat ones from our friends at New Directions.*\n\nAmerican Gun by Cameron McWhirter and Zusha Elinson; design by Rodrigo Corral (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / September 2023)\n\nBright Young Women by Jessica Knoll; design by Kaitlin Kall (Simon & Schuster / September 2023)\n\nThe Circle by Katherena Vermette; design by Jennifer Griffiths; art by KC Adams (Hamish Hamilton Canada / September 2023)\n\nCreep by Myriam Gurba; design by Clay Smith (Avid Reader Press / September 2023)\n\nDisruptions by Steven Millhauser; design by Janet Hansen (Alfred A. Knopf / August 2023)\n\nFear by Robert Peckham; design by Tom Etherington (Profile / September 2023)\n\nGoth by Lol Tolhurst; design by Timothy O’Donnell (Quercus Publishing / September 2023)\n\nThis whole thing is ridiculously in my wheelhouse. The cover photo is by the author (of course!), and there’s a fun note about trying to source the type in Timothy’s Instagram post about the design.\n\nGrand Tour by Elisa Gonzalez; design by Na Kim (Farrar, Straus & Giroux)\n\nI’m not sure it was the intention, but I like the trippy film title / goth art project quality of this.\n\nHow I Won a Nobel Prize by Julius Taranto; design by Lucy Kim (Little Brown & Co / September 2023)\n\nThe Lights by Ben Lerner; design by David Pearson (Granta / September 2023)\n\nHopefully you’ve all had chance to listen to David on the Cover Meeting podcast by now. It’s really good!\n\nThe cover of the US edition published by FSG was designed by Thom Colligan. It’s interesting that they’re similar and yet different. I wonder if it was brief or just a creative coincidence?\n\nThe Love of Singular Men by Victor Heringer; design by Pablo Delcan (New Directions / September 2023)\n\nLove the red type on green.\n\nMonstrilio by Gerardo Sámano Córdova; design by Alex Merto (Zando / March 2023)\n\nThis gives me decidedly 1990’s New York publishing vibes.\n\nStarter Villain by John Scalzi; cover art by Tristan Elwell (Tor / September 2023)\n\nThis just makes me think of a corporate Behemoth.\n\nTime Without Keys by Ida Vitale; design by Tyler Comrie (New Directions / September 2023)\n\nWe Measure the Earth With Our Bodies by Tsering Yangzom Lama; design by Mia Kwon; illustration by Grace J Kim (Bloomsbury / September 2023)\n\nThis is the paperback cover. Mia also designed the jacket of the hardcover published last year.\n\nWound by Oksana Vasyakina; design by Nicole Caputo; art by Jenny Barron (Catapult / September 2023)\n\nThe Wren, The Wren by Anne Enright; design by Kate Sinclair; art by Darek Grabus (McClelland & Stewart / September 2023)\n\nI’m sure I’m not the only one to get Edward Hopper vibes from this cover.\n\nThe cover of the UK edition was designed by Suzanne Dean with a cover illustration by Anna Morrison.\n\n*A bit of admin from last month: I finally managed to spend some time browsing a bookstore and I was able to ascertain that the cover of the US edition of Bridge by Lauren Beukes was designed by Kirin Diemont. Apologies to Kirin for not crediting her at the time in last month’s post. It’s updated now)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
