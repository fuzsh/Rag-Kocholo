        "text": "No.5 SFTS reached a strength of some 2,000 personnel during the war and graduated 1,515 pilots. The rate of flying conducted at the school declined during 1945 and, by November, its aircraft were being readied for storage. In February 1946, No. 5 SFTS was disbanded and its staff and equipment used to re-establish No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS), which had operated during the war as No.1 Service Flying Training School prior to disbanding in 1944. No.1 FTS was allocated 55 Wirraways, two de Havilland Tiger Moths, and one Avro Anson, though in the event it undertook little flying before relocating to Point Cook in August 1947. Post-war demobilisation saw the establishment of several RAAF Care and Maintenance Units (CMU), which were responsible for the upkeep of surplus equipment prior to disposal. No.5 SFTS spawned Care and Maintenance Unit Uranquinty to look after aircraft stored at the base. These were auctioned off in November 1948, and CMU Uranquinty was dissolved the next month.\n\nThe control tower was dismantled by No. 2 Airfield Construction Squadron (2ACS) and shipped to Woomera, the airbase supporting the operation of the RAAF Woomera Test Range.\n\nAfter the RAAF left, the base was used as a migrant centre until September 1951, when the RAAF required the base to be reopened and No. 1 Basic Flying Training School operated there until 19 December 1958, when the base was finally closed down.\n\nToday there is nothing left of the old base, which was sold to a private buyer many years ago. A memorial consisting of a Wirraway engine and a number of information panels can be found in the nearby town.\n\n9 Squadron chopper.\n\nIroquois helicopter machine gunners from No 9 Squadron, check their weapons after a mission in support of Australian troops in the rubber plantations near the 1st Australian Task Force (1ATF) Headquarters, near Vung Tau, South Vietnam, known as Operation Bribie. During a reconnaissance run over the Long Tan area, the RAAF men spotted three Viet Cong (VC) moving through the rubber trees. They swept into the attack and the three VC guerrillas were believed killed.\n\nDraped in machine gun 7.62mm ammunition belts, the crewmen are Brian Víncent Taylor, of Rockhampton, Qld (left), and Brian Boyd (Ron) Hill, of Subiaco, WA (right). These men along with Fl Lt Robert Andrew Macintosh, and co-pilot Geoffrey Alfred Banfield, flew the Iroquois A2-1019 during Operation Bribie. This aircraft is now part of the Australian War Memorial's collection.\n\nThis aircraft was considered a write-off after it had been crash landed in the jungle about 8 miles from the Australian Task Force. It dropped into a clearing from a height of 25 feet after a total engine failure and was air lifted back to Vung Tau by US Army Chinook. 9 Squadron's crew decided to rebuild the crippled aircraft and planned to have it \"flying\" within a month using parts from another damaged aircraft. \"It's a tribute to the skill of the tradesmen in the Squadron\" Flt Lt Cotter said as he inspected the aircraft.\"\n\nThis aircraft was taken on strength by 9 Squadron at Fairbairn in October 1964. In May 1966 it was flown to Richmond then transported via HMAS Sydney to Vung Tau, arriving on 6 June 1966. It returned to Australia in October 1968 and was issued to 5 Squadron at Fairbairn. From 1975-1979 the aircraft was used at Williamtown and later issued to No 2 Flying Training School at Pearce where it was used in Search & Rescue Operations. On 21 May 1985 it was flown by Wing Commander Mick Haxell DFC to the Australian War Memorial and presented to the Memorial by Air Marshal Evans AC DSO AFC. This aircraft was stored at Fairbairn from 21 May 1985 until 18 May 1988 when it was transported to AWM Mitchell store. It is currently on display in the Vietnam Gallery.\n\nIn 1963 HRH Queen Elizabeth and HRH Prince Phillip the Duke of Edinburgh toured Australia. The RAAF Directorate of Public Relations covered the tour and produced a video of the event. The video starts showing the arrival of the royal couple at RAAF Base Fairbairn via a Qantas Boeing 707. The Royal couple are greeted by Prime Minister Menzies and the Governor General. Then the Queen and Duke inspected apprentices from RAAF School of Technical Training Wagga followed by a parade of Officer Cadets at Manuka Oval.\n\nYou can see the video below.\n\nSpotted at the Launceston Casino.\n\nI was in Launceston recently and as one does, decided to try my luck at the Casino only to spot an old mate, John Broughton, who had the same idea and had been in Tassie nomading with wife Josie for the past month or so.\n\nThe poor old Casino is starting to show its age. Opened in 1982, not a lot has been done to the place since way back then except for the introduction of a heap of poker machines. After we had a meal in the very ordinary downstairs Links Buffet (an old Coles Cafeteria would beat it by heaps) we headed for the pokies.\n\nI did alright but poor old John paid for a few bricks and part of the furniture and while he still had the shirt on his back, I grabbed a wheel chair and got him out of the place while he was still in shock.\n\nWe got him back to his motor home and after a few McWillys Cream Sherries he regained his composure, after which Josie put him to bed and tucked him in.\n\nWe heard he was back to normal next day.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the A model Hercs belonging to 36 Squadron started to develop wing problems. These aircraft were by then only 12-15 years old, the first having arrived at Richmond in December 1958. Australia at that time was the first country outside of the US to operate the Herc but it wasnt long before the rest of the world realised what a magnificent aircraft it was and the orders poured in to the Lockheed sales office.\n\nOne by one, 36Sqns Hercs were sent down the tarmac to 2AD which was given the job of rehabilitating (what sort of a word is that??) the wings. Some years later there was a legal battle before the Admin Appeals Tribunal with questions raised concerning the safety standards employed during the work.\n\nThe As were retired in 1978 but by then they had done a ton or work.\n\nKokoda.\n\n76 years ago, the Australian Army met the Japanese Army on the Owen Stanley ranges north east of Port Moresby. The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian Territory of Papua. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitarō Horii and Australian and Papuan land forces. The Japanese objective was to seize Port Moresby by an overland advance from the north coast, following the Kokoda Track over the mountains of the Owen Stanley Range, as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States.\n\nJapanese forces landed and established beachheads near Gona and Buna on the north coast of Papua, on 21 July 1942. Opposed by Maroubra Force, then consisting of four platoons of the 39th Battalion and elements of the Papuan Infantry Battalion, they quickly advanced and captured Kokoda and its strategically vital a irfield on 29 July. Despite reinforcement, the Australian forces were continually pushed back. The veteran Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) 21st Brigade narrowly avoided capture in the Battle of Mission Ridge  Brigade Hill from 6 to 8 September. In the Battle of Ioribaiwa from 13 to 16 September, the 25th Brigade under Brigadier Kenneth Eather fought the Japanese to a halt but ceded the field to the Japanese, withdrawing back to Imita Ridge.\n\nThe Japanese advanced to within sight of Port Moresby but withdrew on 26 September. They had outrun their supply line and had been ordered to withdraw in consequence of reverses suffered at Guadalcanal. The Australian pursuit encountered strong opposition from well prepared positions around Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village from 11 to 28 October. Following the unopposed recapture of Kokoda, a major battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari from 4 to 11 November, resulting in a victory for the Australians. By 16 November, two brigades of the Australian 7th Division had crossed the Kumusi River at Wairopi, and advanced on the Japanese beachheads in a joint Australian and United States operation. The Japanese forces at BunaGona held out until 22 January 1943.\n\nAustralian reinforcement was hampered by the logistical problems of supporting a force in isolated, mountainous, jungle terrain. There were few aircraft available for aerial resupply, and techniques for it were still primitive. Australian command considered that the Vickers machine gun and medium mortars were too heavy to carry and would be ineffective in the jungle terrain. Without artillery, mortars or medium machine guns, the Australians faced an opponent equipped with mountain guns and light howitzers that had been carried into the mountains and proved to be a decisive advantage. Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of BunaGona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day.\n\nIn consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \"crisis of command\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers. The generalship of MacArthur and Blamey has been criticised for unreasonable and unrealistic perceptions of the terrain and conditions under which the campaign was fought  to the detriment of the troops committed to the fighting. The Kokoda Track campaign has been mythologised as Australia's Thermopylae and incorporated into the Anzac legend even though the premise of a vastly numerically-superior enemy has since been shown to be incorrect.\n\nStrength:\n\nAllies: 30,000. Japan: 13,500\n\nCasualties from the conflict were (roughly):"
