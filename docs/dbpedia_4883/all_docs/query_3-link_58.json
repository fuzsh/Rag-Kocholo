Raised in Launceston, 43 years old, married with two boys.\n\nWhat do I believe in? Hard work, standing up for what's right, tackling the big issues and the independence of local government.\n\nWhat have I done on council? In the past 12 months I've initiated a full, public review of Launceston's rates system; launched a campaign to restore the Duck Reach Power Station, fought to get a tip shop back and operating, campaigned for more water through the Gorge, got support for a practical, scientific approach to improving the health of the Tamar River, helped secure an annual arts festival and held Ben Lomond Water to account through public forums on price rises.\n\nMy vision - Launceston becoming known as the healthiest place in Australia; a thriving and diverse business-sporting-cultural centre, underpinned by a clean environment.\n\nI also recently launched a campaign for Launceston to get its fair share of Commonwealth payments to fund regional facilities like the QVMAG, the aquatic centre and Aurora\n\nStadium, thus easing the burden on ratepayers.\n\nIf you're looking for an independent, hardworking, full-time alderman and deputy mayor who gets results, then I ask for your vote and support.\n\nTONY BENNEWORTH\n\nI AM a proud, locally born and bred Launcestonian!\n\nI have experienced living overseas and interstate, experiences which have helped broaden my outlook on life.\n\nTypically among Australians these days, I have had several career changes, starting my working life as a journalist and working in the banking and finance sector, in sales and\n\nmarketing, two stints as a member of parliament, and in commercial real estate.\n\nI am a former state cricketer and commentator.\n\nYes, I'm competitive and enjoy success, but I'm also a team player and love to share victory with the team, the community and the state.\n\nDealing daily with both local business people and big operators has enabled me to harness community sentiments on a variety of issues.\n\nI am concerned with the state of the economy. I strongly believe in local government reform, including planning.\n\nThe state of our river, the future of our recreational facilities and the promotion of a \"can do'' attitude are all issues close to my heart.\n\nJIN-OH CHOI\n\nLIKE the other 17 candidates, I am asking for your number 1 vote.\n\nI encourage you to ask questions of myself and other candidates to find out what we're really about.\n\nI stand for:\n\n- Planning which is effective and services that meet people's needs;\n\n- Making sure that diverse groups and communities flourish together;\n\n- A clever, active and creative community;\n\n- Making sure that the community is economically robust, diverse and sustainable;\n\n- Remembering that our natural environment is valued, this should be restored and protected; and\n\n- A council that works with each other and the whole community.\n\nI want to be part of our council in the direction that people want.\n\nPeople really care about Launceston: they care about its character, they care about their lifestyle, they care about the beautiful, natural environment we live in - and so do I.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me on 0408 271 800, jin-oh@jin-ohchoi.id.au or www.jin-ohchoi.id.au.\n\nJIM COX\n\nWITH more than 17 years representing the people of Launceston in State Parliament, I believe I have the experience needed to represent your views around the council table and take action on issues that are important to you.\n\nI am standing as an independent candidate, and have the determination to represent the people of Launceston and its suburbs with the commitment you deserve.\n\nAs a former Tasmanian minister for local government, I have the knowledge and skills to make decisions and get things done.\n\nExciting developments are being proposed for the municipality, and we need to get the decisions around these projects right.\n\nWe must not add to parking and traffic congestion, and ensure the infrastructure is in place to enhance our city, not detract from it.\n\nIt is vital that we spend ratepayers' money on services that matter to you, no matter where you live in the municipality.\n\nI was born and raised in Launceston, have raised a family here and am lucky enough to have been able to build a career here.\n\nI know this city and its suburbs and would be honoured to again have the chance to ensure this city supports you and your family.\n\nTOM ELLISON\n\nTHIS year, voters have a real choice. Between them, the six retiring aldermen have accumulated 100 years serving on the Launceston City Council. Three have chosen not to contest\n\ntheir seats.\n\nNobody doubts the importance of experience. But experience and vision are not the same.\n\nAs a financial analyst, I work with complex and challenging issues on a daily basis. The sorts of problems Launceston will need to face in coming years.\n\nI believe Launceston needs a new direction. A sustainable future. A jobs-rich future. A chance to remain the best regional city in Australia.\n\nWe can only achieve that by electing leaders with talent and vision who aren't saddled to the past. Aldermen with the passion to encourage the development of new and innovative businesses in our region. People prepared to stand up for our city, environment and future. Candidates prepared to say the Tamar Valley does not need a pulp mill.\n\nLaunceston could, and should be a business hub for Tasmania. A model for other regional cities. I can help achieve that.\n\nIf you've already committed to another candidate, I'd be grateful for your number two vote.\n\nDANNY GIBSON\n\nI AM passionate about Launceston. As an independent, fresh voice for our city, I am connected and committed. I will work hard to represent you with integrity.\n\nI am committed to listening and to serving your interests. As a member of Rotary, chairman of Cityprom and leader of arts and youth initiatives, I have the governance experience\n\nnecessary.\n\nNot afraid of a challenge, I am capable of offering new ideas and suggestions but I will also deliver outcomes. I am about making Launceston a vibrant community with more focus\n\non our people, culture and way of life.\n\nI am committed to business and our CBD. I want to clean up the river through the development of a body with relevant, informed knowledge which pursues the state government\n\nfor the budget allocation not delivered.\n\nI'm about encouraging youth and not blaming them for everything which happens within our community.\n\nA vote for me is not a token young vote but a vote for collaborative engagement and a vote to question all that your rates are spent on.\n\nI promise to listen and respond for Launceston through strong leadership, a proven passion and the ability to relate to people.\n\nNICK HUTCHINSON\n\nI BELIEVE our community has an amazing future; its greatest value lying with its people.\n\nAs an alderman I will endeavour to develop and build that value within our residents.\n\nI'm a young man (26 years old) with a growing family who understands the pressures that face many of us.\n\nI have worked with a variety of organisations and have gained a keen insight into various levels of our community from youth to the mature aged, those in business, retail and\n\nfamilies.\n\nI will bring these experiences to council, along with my desire to listen to and work for the community, to ensure decisions are made with the best outcomes for Launceston.\n\nNever before has there been such a need in our city for aldermen who focus on helping and developing local businesses, minimising rate and fee increases, fostering development within our city and encouraging safety within our community.\n\nWe need aldermen who work together as a united front to achieve this.\n\nIf elected I will work towards these goals for the benefit of Launceston and its people.\n\nPlease contact me on 0408 067 087 to discuss any concerns. Your support is much appreciated.\n\nCLARE JOKUSZIES\n\nI HAVE been a Launceston resident for 24 years and, for the majority of this time, I have, with my husband Manfred, run award-winning small businesses in and around Launceston.\n\nSince the sale of our cafe, Konditorei Cafe Manfred, we have operated a manufacturing and export-import business.\n\nThere are many issues that I am passionate about, and I fully support community discussion of these.\n\nI recognise the contribution small businesses make and the need to protect them.\n\nSustainable new enterprises should be encouraged, yet not at the expense of those we already have. A careful balance is needed.\n\nWise and prudent council spending is vital to make the most of the fine amenities that we have.\n\nThe tough issue of safety on our streets and our roads is of great concern. I also see the importance of council encouraging responsible pet ownership.\n\nI am totally independent of any political party, a hard worker and always give my all. If elected, I guarantee I will work hard for the entire Launceston community and I am prepared\n\nto dedicate as much time as possible for the benefit of our city.\n\nTo contact me phone 0438 892 691 or go to www.yourcityyourvote.com.au.\n\nHUGH McKENZIE\n\nTHIS council election offers Launceston voters an opportunity to make a real choice about the governance and direction they want for their community.\n\nI am standing because I believe I can make a positive contribution to building Launceston's future prosperity.\n\nAs a semi-retired accountant, I have the necessary time, skills and energy to develop and implement a new vision for this city.\n\nI have lived, studied and worked in Launceston for most of my life and raised four sons here. I have been committed to local activities, including my sons' school board, local arts\n\nand sporting events, like the Launceston Cycling Classic.\n\nThere are many issues facing our community.\n\nIf, like me, you want a council that can implement successful strategies that attract visitors and new business investment, you need to vote for aldermen who understand and have\n\nexperience in the business sector.\n\nMy record proves I have the expertise and ability to think creatively and deliver results, rather than just be involved in discussions.\n\nPlease contact me on 0418 132 442 or visit my website www.hughmckenzie.com.au.\n\nI look forward to hearing what you think is important and how I can best represent you.\n\nLYN MITCHELL\n\nI AM happily married to Kent, have two sons and have lived in Newnham for 40 years.\n\nI have been employed as a special education teacher's assistant since 1998, working with children with disabilities and special needs. Contributing to the educational needs of these students has been extremely rewarding.\n\nIn my role as publicity officer and board director with Bowls Tasmania (North) I also write regular lawn bowls columns for The Examiner.\n\nI have held numerous executive and committee positions and have life memberships from the Rocherlea Primary School and Launceston Soccer and Sports Club as a result of my\n\ninvolvements.\n\nIf it means less governance, rate reductions and improved infrastructure and services, I support council amalgamations.\n\nAs ratepayers are struggling with increased financial burdens, a much fairer rating system must be introduced as soon as possible.\n\nI am passionate about the Tamar River and increasing water flow through the Gorge.\n\nI have no ties to any political party and am completely independent. I will act in the best interests of the community without any outside influences and if elected I promise open,\n\nhonest and transparent representation.\n\nTONY PECK\n\nTONY Peck fully supports development in the municipality, particularly in job creation, as jobs must be the top priority.\n\nThe sustainable economy of our community is of the utmost importance so we can make Launceston a better place for us and our children into the future.\n\n\"Start Something Special in Launceston,'' the city's new promotional campaign, is an opportunity for the whole tourism industry to be involved and is vitally important for us all.\n\nAlderman Peck is one of the city's most experienced and hardworking aldermen.\n\nHaving served Launceston as mayor (four years) and deputy mayor (three years) he is passionate about Launceston.\n\nHe is chairman of the council's economic development committee and a member of the finance and audit committee.\n\nAlderman Peck is a board member of Launceston Airport on behalf of council.\n\nHe is a proven community and business leader who will achieve the best value for ratepayers.\n\nHe has enthusiasm and vision, and a commitment to stand up and be counted when Launceston needs a voice.\n\nAlderman Peck supports dredging of the Tamar River, along with river edge development. He wants to keep the town clock chiming.\n\nNICK PEDLEY\n\nTHE Launceston City Council is in desperate need for some intelligent young members.\n\nNick Pedley is running for council because he offers the youth and energy the council has needed for a long time.\n\nMr Pedley is a 22-year-old currently working as a teacher's aide whilst at university studying a bachelor of business.\n\nHe believes that the council needs a Gen Y view when dealing with issues facing the next generation.\n\nIf elected, he will focus on four major policy problems within the Launceston community.\n\n1. Anti-social behaviour within Launceston because everyone has the right to feel safe in their community.\n\n2. Decreasing the cost of council with resource sharing and greater state and federal support for the ongoing costs of our regional facilities such as the aquatic centre.\n\n3. Council should lead the debate on the Tamar River. For too long council has had a policy of all talk and no action.\n\n4. Launceston as a city and as a council needs to become more sustainable for future generations.\n\nGen Ys need a say.\n\nTo discuss any issues please contact napedley@gmail.com or 0458 866 008.\n\nALEX PETROVSKY\n\nTHE reason why I am standing for the council is that I am tired of hearing people complain about some of the decisions (or lack of) made by past councils. It is time to stop complaining and take action.\n\nWe need down-to-earth people with commercial skills on the council to avoid some of the mistakes of the past such as spending millions on projects that have not been properly\n\ncosted.\n\nTasmania is facing challenging economic times with jobs and business incomes under pressure and it is critical that the council does not further increase the cost pressures we are\n\nall facing.\n\nAt the same time the council must be proactive in encouraging developments that will enhance our city. Improving parking in the city is essential to stop business being lost to the lower cost municipalities that cover our outer suburbs.\n\nWe need to not only retain and enhance events such as Festivale, the V8 Supercars at Symmons Plains and AFL at Aurora Stadium, but reinstate past successes such as the Basin Concert and support new events.\n\nIf elected I will donate one-third of my alderman's allowance to support bringing back the Basin Concert and Fireworks on New Year's Eve. I challenge other candidates to make\n\na similar commitment.\n\nROB SOWARD\n\nROB Soward was elected as an independent alderman and believes that party politics has no place in council.\n\nDuring Alderman Soward's time on council he has been extremely effective in getting things done.\n\nHis persistence has seen many issues resolved because he puts people first and makes sure that issues are followed through to their resolution.\n\nAlderman Soward is actively involved in the community and those he has worked with can testify to his enthusiasm, effectiveness and dedication.\n\nIn tough economic times, we need strong and experienced leadership and Alderman Soward's extensive experience will enable him to be an effective leader and a strong voice for\n\nHe has two university degrees and a fair share of commonsense that comes from being an active and involved member of our community.\n\nAMY TYLER\n\nI AM a 27-year-old Launceston City Council candidate for the Greens Party.\n\nRaised in Launceston and having worked and studied around the world, I've returned here to live because I recognise the uniqueness of our city.\n\nWith your vote, I will advance a local economy that attracts young professionals and supports families, public spaces and transport that connect community making living healthy\n\neasier and reducing pressure on our hospitals, neighbourhoods free from pokies, sustainable development not a pulp mill and a woman's perspective on council that will question how we can better invest our rates and not just spend them.\n\nI believe we need to invest in:\n\n- Our tip, so it is a place for recycled goods and not a dump;\n\n- Cycleways, pathways and efficient public transport so a fifth of our budget isn't spent on local roads annually;\n\n- Energy efficiency to reduce costs of living; and\n\n- Progressive business practice that supports the distinct needs of young women who want a family and a career.\n\nI have the vision for what is possible, the youthfulness to work actively to ensure it happens and the backing of a party growing in strength and influence.\n\nANNETTE WADDLE\n\nWELL here we go again.\n\nSince last election I've been very interested in all the mobile phone towers springing up around suburban Launceston and the electromagnetic radiation they do or don't emit.\n\nThe federal laws at the moment pretty well stop local councils from objecting to them. People-power sometimes works, like in Sandy Bay.\n\nThey persist in building them among houses and schools and they really don't know what harm can come in the future to people who live nearby.\n\nI would like federal legislation changed to force the companies to share the towers; that would halve the need for so many towers.\n\nYes, I do own a mobile phone.\n\nCausing a bit of angst among our residents are bike lanes and black spots and planning schemes.\n\nNine on-street parking spots will be lost at Mowbray Heights when Coles is finished, mainly to accommodate a set of traffic lights in Invermay Road to connect Coles and Woolworths.\n\nI would rather have nine on-street parking spots back outside our little local shops than pander to the big boys.\n\nI still keep a watch on the Lilydale area for anything it needs.\n\nI'm only a phone call away on 0407 879 478.\n\nMARK WEBB\n\nMARK Webb has outstanding ability and competency.\n\nAims:\n\n- Selective cost-cutting to minimise rates and charges.\n\n- Focus on the core council functions and good service _ be brilliant at the basics.\n\n- Improve the rates system to better reflect costs of providing services.\n\n- More logical council boundaries, including mergers.\n\nLong-range planning for infrastructure, facilities and amenities.\n\n- Simplicity and timeliness, rather than bureaucracy, for people dealing with the council.\n\n- Professional business-like monitoring of management and organisational performance and improve corporate governance.\n\nQualifications: bachelor of commerce, bachelor of economics with first-class honours, master of business administration.\n\nPrevious board experience: University of Tasmania Council, Teachers Police and Nurses Credit Union, CONNECT Credit Union.\n\nOther experience: Merchant banking, strategic planning, auditing, accounting, administration and client service roles.\n\nQualities: Independent, intelligent, hard-working, professional, ethical and determined to do an excellent job.\n\nKEITH WENN\n\nAS PRINCIPAL of Launceston College for 10 years, I manage and lead an organisation that has developed to 1500 students with a staff of 154.\n\nPrior to Launceston College, I was principal of Riverside High, West Launceston, Waverley and four country schools.\n\nI am standing for the council because in difficult times more of the same is not the best option for our city - more effective management is needed.\n\nCouncil is a multimillion-dollar organisation responsible for your money. Value for money requires effective decision making based on sound judgment.\n\nCouncil should be composed of people who have a proven ability to successfully manage multimillion-dollar budgets.\n\nI bring a high level of management, financial and organisational skills developed across a wide spectrum of issues - infrastructure, personnel, resource effectiveness and development - all based on constant improvement and value for money decisions.\n\nI commit, as I did in the Tasmania Tomorrow debate, to support what is best for this community not political agendas.\n\nIf elected I will strongly address issues, such as our river, our hospital, our schools, rates reform and local government reform - your issues.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
