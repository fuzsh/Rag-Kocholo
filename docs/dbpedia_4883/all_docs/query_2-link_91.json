Best has written several books about the misleading use of statistics in public discourse and about societal problems. Threatened Children: Rhetoric and Concern about Child-Victims, for which Best won the Charles Horton Cooley Award, argues that statistics about child abuse have been distorted by the media to create a feeling of hysteria on the subject. In this climate of anxiety, there is a push to expand the definitions of child abuse to cover a range of behaviors that Best considers disturbingly inclusive, including such things as exposure to song lyrics and secondhand smoke, circumcision, parental attitudes toward gender differences, and even lack of a television. Best argues that emotion, rather than reason, has driven child-welfare policy in America, and that closer scrutiny of facts could result in saner attitudes. LeRoy Schultz, writing in Institute for Psychological Therapies Journal, noted that Threatened Children might be \"the best intellectual history of the current child abuse [controversy] ever assembled.\"\n\nIn Random Violence: How We Talk about New Crimes and New Victims, Best again faults the media for exaggerating statistics about violent crime and thereby creat- ing the perception that random violence is a pervasive reality in contemporary American society. He writes that data do not support such a perception; in fact, many statistics indicate that violent crime has decreased. Furthermore, far from being random, violent crime tends to occur according to patterns that relate to poverty, social class, and other sociological factors. Yet the media consistently frame crime reports in ways that suggest randomness and that create, in the words of Western Criminology Review contributor Marilyn McShane, \"a melodrama of claimsmaking so that good and evil, victim and offender are easier to understand but, ironically, further from the truth.\"\n\nRandom Violence is \"a magnificent contribution to the social construction of social problems literature,\" wrote Tony R. Smith in Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture. \"The lucid analysis draws upon an impressive range of resources to support the central thesis that language is consequential. The language we select to talk about social problems shapes the way we think about and subsequently address society's problems. Effectively tackling our problems demands that we first come to terms with how we talk about them.\"\n\nIn Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists and More Damned Lies and Statistics: How Numbers Confuse Public Issues, Best looks at how skewed data affect perceptions of and responses to public problems. Writing in the Christian Science Monitor, Steve Weinberg described Damned Lies and Statistics as a \"clearly written primer for the statistically impaired\" and \"as important to discussions of public policy as any book circulating today.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nBest, Joel, Random Violence: How We Talk about New Crimes and New Victims, University of California Press (Berkeley, CA), 1999.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Historical Review, June, 2000, David T.
