II. During the reign of King Fejsál of Iraq, which lasted from 1939 to 1958, the coinage of Iraq underwent significant development. The king strove for modernization and economic development, and this was also reflected in the coinage. In 1939, at the beginning of Fejsál's reign, gold and silver coins were still minted in Iraq, but these were soon replaced by the previously unknown paper money. The first Iraqi paper money was issued in 1940 and was made in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 dinars. During the Second World War, Iraq was under German occupation, and this also affected the coinage. The German occupiers replaced the Iraqi money with their own money and removed the royal symbols from the coins. After the war, in 1945, Iraq returned to minting its own coins. Royal symbols were returned to coins and new coins were introduced, such as the 10 fils and 25 fils. In 1958, after the assassination of King Fejsál, a revolution broke out in Iraq and the royal system was overthrown. After the revolution, the new government also reorganized the Iraqi mint and introduced new coins and paper money. II. The coinage of Fejszál still has significant collector value today.
