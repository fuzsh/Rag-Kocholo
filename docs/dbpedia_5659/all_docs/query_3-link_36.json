The image, taken at London Airport in October 1958, marks the end of an era as the young monarch, dressed in a smart suit and holding a briefcase, steps off the plane, ready to embark on his reign. Born in 1935, Faisal II was the last monarch of Iraq, ascending to the throne at the tender age of 16 following the death of his father, King Ghazi. His education in the UK, which began in 1947, was part of a broader effort to modernize and Westernize Iraq, and the young king was deeply influenced by his experiences in England. However, the political climate in Iraq was volatile, and the monarchy would soon face significant challenges. In July 1958, a military coup led by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party overthrew the government, and Faisal II was forced into exile. The king and his family were eventually executed in November 1959, bringing an end to the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq. This photograph, taken just months before the tragic events that would unfold, offers a poignant reminder of a young king's hopes and dreams as he returned home to assume his role as ruler of his country. The image is a testament to the complex and often tumultuous history of Iraq and the Middle East in the mid-20th century.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nFramed Prints\n\nIntroducing the stunning Framed Print from Media Storehouse's exclusive collection, featuring the captivating image of King Faisal II of Iraq.
