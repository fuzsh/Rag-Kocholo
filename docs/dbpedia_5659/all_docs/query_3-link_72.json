        "text": "Hezbollah fires barrage of rockets at Israel from southern Lebanon\n\nDozens of rockets have been fired from Lebanon toward Israeli territory, the Israel Defense Forces said late Thursday, but the military estimated that just five crossed into Israel.\n\nThere are no reports of damage or injuries.\n\nHezbollah later confirmed it launched dozens of Katyusha rockets at the Matzuva settlement in northern Israel.\n\nEarlier, sirens sounded across various communities in the western Galilee region, after two days without launches detected from Lebanon.\n\nThe IDF said shortly after the launches were carried out, Israeli planes “struck the Hezbollah launcher from which the projectiles were launched in the area of Yater in southern Lebanon.”\n\nIt added that IDF artillery had fired to remove threats in the areas of Rmaych and Ramyeh in southern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech Thursday that the group would resume confrontations on the border, but they should not be “mistaken” for the promised response to the killing of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, Fu’ad Shukr, on Tuesday.\n\nRemember: Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, operates out of southern Lebanon.\n\nThe recent killing of three high-profile figures in Iran-backed militant groups, which have had repeated clashes with Israel throughout its war in Gaza, has raised fears of a broader Middle East conflict.\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect that Hezbollah has taken responsibility for the attack.\n\nHezbollah says response to Beirut strike will go beyond border skirmishes, but stops short of declaring war\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed a response to Israel’s attack in southern Beirut earlier this week, which killed the group’s top commander Fu’ad Shukr and at least five civilians, including two children, according to the Lebanese health ministry.\n\n“This was not just an assassination operation. This was an assault,” Nasrallah said in a fiery speech Thursday afternoon during a funeral procession for Shukr in southern Beirut.\n\nNasrallah said the response would go beyond the scope of the daily border skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces that have been ongoing during Israel’s war with Hamas, adding that the retaliation will be “studied.”\n\nHe stopped short of declaring war but said Israel had crossed “red lines” in Beirut, as well as in Tehran with the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, which Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility for the killing.\n\n“They’ve picked a fight with all of us,” Nasrallah said, referring to the Iran-backed network of armed groups that spans Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iraq.\n\n“On all supportive fronts, we have now entered a new phase, different than the past phase,” he said, referring to the Iran-backed axis.\n\nRemember: Shukr is one of three high-profile figure in Iran-backed militant groups to be killed in recent weeks.\n\nHaniyeh was killed Wednesday by an explosive device planted two months before the explosion, a source tells CNN. And Israel says a strike last month in Gaza killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas’ military wing.\n\nPalestinian reporters hold vigil for Al Jazeera colleagues killed in reported Israeli strike\n\nAbout a dozen Palestinian journalists coalesced outside Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in northern Gaza on Thursday to protest against the killing of their colleagues in a reported Israeli airstrike earlier this week.\n\nCNN footage from the demonstration showed reporters wearing their blue press vests and lining the courtyard of the medical facility, east of Gaza City. The sound of Israeli drones cuts through overhead.\n\nAl Jazeera correspondent Anas Al-Sharif and others paid tribute to their late colleagues, carrying photos and slogans that read: “Journalism is not a crime.”\n\nCalls for press freedom: The vigil came a day after Al Jazeera staffers Ismail Al-Ghoul and Rami Al-Rifi, both aged 27, were killed in a reported Israeli strike while on assignment in Al-Shati refugee camp, sparking condemnation from advocacy groups in what has been the deadliest period for journalists since 1992.\n\nA third Palestinian, 16-year-old Khaled Al-Shawa, was also killed in the strike on Wednesday, according to local reporters. The teenager had been riding his orange bicycle to deliver food for an elderly resident in the neighborhood before he was killed, according to Saudi-backed broadcaster Al-Arabiya\n\nKhader Al-Za’anoun of WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, also contributed reporting from Gaza City.\n\nHezbollah chief says Israel \"doesn’t realize the red lines it has crossed\"\n\nThe leader of Hezbollah has warned Israel “doesn’t realized the red lines it has crossed,” following a spate of Israeli attacks on multiple fronts in the Middle East.\n\n“On all supportive fronts, we have now entered a new phase, different than the past phase,” the paramilitary group’s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech in Lebanon on Thursday. The fronts Nasrallah references involve Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\n\nNasrallah also rejected Israel’s accusation that the militant group orchestrated a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, saying Hezbollah’s “internal investigations” show that the group “have nothing to do” with the assault.\n\nThe rocket blast tore through the town of Majdal Shams and killed at least 12 people. The children killed in the strike had been playing on a soccer field, according to a list from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and residents who spoke to CNN.\n\nIran's acting foreign minister speaks to regional counterparts after assassination of Hamas political leader\n\nIran’s acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani spoke with several regional counterparts to discuss the assassination of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh as concerns mount over escalating tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\nIran has accused Israel of assassinating Haniyeh in his northern Tehran residence on Wednesday. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nKani spoke separately with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi.\n\nIran’s acting foreign minister told his Saudi counterpart that Iran will use its “legitimate right to take remorseful and decisive action against” Israel.\n\nKani told the Qatari prime minister that Israel attacked Iran’s national security by killing Haniyeh, an “official guest” who was in Iran attending the inauguration of the Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nSpeaking to the Turkish foreign minister, Kani said that the attack in Iran will pose “serious threats to regional security and stability.”\n\n\"The bloodbath doesn't stop.\" 8 Palestinians killed in Israel strike while waiting for Gaza aid, witnesses say\n\nAt least eight people lining up for aid at a Gaza refugee camp were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Thursday, according to Palestinian witnesses. Two children and their mother were also injured in the attack and the dead and injured were brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, according to CNN footage.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike.\n\nThe video showed generations of Palestinian men flocking outside the hospital in Deir al-Balah. Pools of blood streaked the floors of the medical facility. Mourners cowered over shrouded bodies, delicately kissing the deceased and wailing in disbelief.\n\nIn another scene, rows of worshippers stood to perform Janazah, the Islamic funeral prayers. Echoes of “Allahu Akbar,” which means “God is greater” in Arabic, filled a courtyard of the refugee camp. Young girls and boys wearing shoes covered in dust crouched near the ceremony, their eyes tired with grief.\n\n“We want to live in dignity like the rest of the world,” added Abdo. “We are in a genocide… We beg for everyone to stop this war.”\n\nMohammad Al-Sawalhi contributed reporting from Gaza. Dana Karni contributed reporting.\n\nHamas military chief's killing a “milestone” on path to achieving Israeli war goals, defense minister says\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has said the killing of Hamas’ military chief is a “significant milestone in the process of dismantling Hamas as a military and governing authority in Gaza.”\n\nThe Israeli military said they killed Mohammed Deif in an airstrike in Khan Younis in July.\n\nDeif’s death would be the killing of the highest-ranking Hamas military official in Gaza since the start of the war. CNN has contacted Hamas for comment.\n\nThe Israeli attack on him killed at least 90 Palestinians in Al-Mawasi, half of whom were women and children, according to Gazan health officials. At the time, a UN worker described the aftermath as “the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael not invited to ceremony commemorating atomic bombing of Nagasaki\n\nIsrael will not be invited to this year’s peace ceremony commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki to promote a “peaceful and somber atmosphere” at the August 9 event, the city’s mayor said.\n\nThe decision contrasts with that of Hiroshima, whose authorities told CNN last month they had no intention of retracting Israel’s invitation to their own peace event, despite calls for the country to be sidelined.\n\nBoth cities had been under pressure from activists and bomb survivor groups to exclude Israel due to its assault on Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed since Israel began targeting Hamas following the militant group’s October 7 attack.\n\nNagasaki’s mayor Shiro Suzuki said that Israel’s exclusion was due to security concerns and was not a political decision.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nThousands gather at memorial service for assassinated Hamas political leader in Iran\n\nThousands have gathered in the Iranian capital, Tehran, at a memorial service for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nA procession is scheduled to start at Tehran University and will head towards Azadi Square, according to Iranian news agency Mehr News.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will lead prayers for Haniyeh today, according to Iranian state media, and the country has announced three days of public mourning.\n\nAccording to live pictures of the service, thousands were seen gathered together to listen to Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the speaker of Iran’s parliament.\n\nMany in the crowd were seen waving the Palestinian and Iranian flags as well as the yellow flag of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\nHaniyeh will be buried in Qatar’s capital, Doha, on Friday, Hamas said. Before his assassination, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha, where Hamas had a political office.\n\nFears of wider conflict following killings of Hamas and Hezbollah figures. Here's the latest\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge the death of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran yesterday.\n\nHamas said Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.\n\nThe killing is a major escalation of conflict in the region that throws it into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase.\n\nHaniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group assassinated in recent days, following Israel’s killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon.\n\nIran’s supreme leader will lead memorial prayers for Haniyeh today, according to Iranian state media.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\nIran vows revenge: Iran’s supreme leader has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Haniyeh, the New York Times reported citing three Iranian officials familiar with the orders. Israel will pay a “heavy price” for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil, said senior Iranian diplomat Abbas Araghchi.\n\nIsrael’s response: Israel has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in the last few days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday, and vowed to keep fighting as the region stands on edge.\n\nFuture of ceasefire talks unclear: A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN on Wednesday that Haniyeh’s assassination could “complicate mediation talks,” as he had been “instrumental” to their progress. The source said Haniyeh was a “key decision-maker,” along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.\n\nHere are the latest developments stoking tensions in the region:\n\nFu’ad Shukr: Hezbollah has confirmed the death of senior commander Fu’ad Shukr, and a Lebanese security source told CNN that his body was found under rubble in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Israel had said it killed Shukr in a drone strike in a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold. The death toll in the strike has risen to six.\n\nPalestinians tortured: A UN Human Rights Office report said Palestinian detainees from Gaza and the West Bank have faced torture, mistreatment and sexual abuse since October 7 and that at least 53 have died in detention. The Israeli military confirmed to CNN that a number of Palestinian detainees died while in their custody in the prison facilities.\n\n“Dangerous escalation”: UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the attacks in Beirut and Tehran “represent a dangerous escalation” in the region. He said that the international community needs to work together to use diplomacy to de-escalate and to try to prevent “any actions that could push the entire Middle East over the edge.”\n\nFlight restrictions issued around Tehran ahead of memorial procession for Haniyeh\n\nTemporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThe notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.\n\nFlight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. local time (10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) until 10:30 a.m. local time (2:30 a.m. ET Thursday), according to the notice.\n\nHaniyeh’s memorial procession will be held from the University of Tehran towards the capital’s Azadi Square, Iran’s semi-official news agency Mehr News said.\n\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will lead prayers Thursday morning, according to Iran’s state-run PressTV news outlet.\n\nIran’s Civil Aviation Organization regularly issues Notice to Air Missions across the country, which alert pilots to issues that impact flight operations. But the one in place for Thursday specifically restricts flights in the airspace surrounding where Haniyeh’s procession is due to take place and within the same frame."
