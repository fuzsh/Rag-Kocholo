        "text": "Kassem is killed in a coup led Colonel Abd al-Salam Aref and the military as well as members of the Ba'ath party (Feb. 8). The Ba'ath party, founded in Syria, advocates pan-Arabism, secularism, and socialism. Colonel Aref becomes president, Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr of the Ba'ath Party becomes president.\n\nAref purges the government of Ba'ath party, including President al-Bakr.\n\nIraq retaliates against the Kurds for supporting Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, and through \"Operation Anfal\" slaughters civilians or forces them to relocate. Thousands flee to Turkey (Feb.–Sept.).\n\nIran-Iraq war ends in a stalemate. An estimated 1.5 million died in the conflict (Aug. 20).\n\nIraqi troops invade Kuwait. Saddam Hussein justifies the attack by blaming Kuwait for falling oil prices that harm the Iraqi economy (Aug. 2).\n\nThe UN imposes economic sanctions on Iraq (Aug 6).\n\nU.S. military forces arrive in Saudi Arabia (Aug. 9).\n\nThe UN issues a Security Council resolution setting Jan. 15, 1991, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, authorizing the use of \"all necessary means\" if it does not comply (Nov. 29).\n\nThe Persian Gulf War begins when Operation Desert Storm launched by a U.S.-led coalition of 32 countries under the leadership of U.S. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. A campaign of air strikes against Iraq begins (Jan. 16–17).\n\nGround forces invade Kuwait and Iraq, vanquish the Iraqi army, and liberate Kuwait. President George H. W. Bush declares a cease-fire on the fourth day (Feb. 24–28).\n\nShiites and Kurds rebel, encouraged by the United States. Iraq quashes the rebellions, killing thousands (March).\n\nFormal cease-fire is signed. Saddam Hussein accepts UN resolution agreeing to destroy weapons of mass destruction and allowing UN inspectors to monitor the disarmament (April 6).\n\nA no-fly zone is established in Northern Iraq to protect the Kurds from Saddam Hussein (April 10).\n\nUN weapons inspectors report that Iraq has concealed much of its nuclear and chemical weapons programs. It is the first of many such reports over the next decade, pointing out Iraq's thwarting of the UN weapons inspectors (July 30).\n\nIraq suspends all cooperation with the UN inspectors (Jan. 13).\n\nUN secretary-general Kofi Annan brokers a peaceful solution to the standoff. Over the next months Baghdad continued to impede the UN inspection team, demanding that sanctions be lifted (Feb. 23).\n\nSaddam Hussein puts a complete halt to the inspections (Oct. 31).\n\nIraq agrees to unconditional cooperation with the UN inspectors (Nov. 14), but by a month later, chief UN weapons inspector Richard Butler reports that Iraq has not lived up to its promise (Dec. 15).\n\nThe United States and Britain began four days of intensive air strikes, dubbed Operation Desert Fox. The attacks focused on command centers, missile factories, and airfields—targets that the Pentagon believed would damage Iraq's weapons stores (Dec. 16–19).\n\nBeginning in January, weekly, sometimes daily, bombings of Iraqi targets within the northern no-fly zone begin, carried out by U.S. and British bombers. More than 100 air strikes take place during 1999, and continue regularly over the next years. The U.S. and Britain hope the constant barrage of air strikes will weaken Saddam Hussein's grip on Iraq (Jan. 1999–present)."
