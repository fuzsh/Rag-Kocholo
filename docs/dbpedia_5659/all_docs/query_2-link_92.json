Gifted and imaginative, they developed the first known system of writing. The Sumerian language, linguistically separate from any other, has been preserved for us today through the thousands of clay tablets its speakers left behind. Sumerians also invented the wheel, a mathematical system based on the number 60 (the basis of time in the modern world), and a system of banking.\n\nThe Sumerians were the very first people to settle into Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) around 4800 BC marking the emergence of the first human civilization.

The Akkadians were a Semitic-speaking group who united the Semites and Sumerian speakers under one rule. The Akkadian empire was short-lived and in 2125 BC the empire fell. Mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two distinct empires: Assyria in the north and Babylonia in the south.\n\nIn 2340 BC Sargon of Akkad conquered most of the Sumerian city-states, thus ending Sumer with the rise of the Akkadian Empire, sometimes regarded as the first empire in history.

Mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two distinct empires: Assyria in the north and Babylonia in the south.\n\nThe Babylonian Empire ushered in a new era in Mesopotamia after the downfall of the Akkadians. The reign of Hammurabi 1792-1750 BC the sixth King of Babylon is regarded as one of the highlights of ancient Mesopotamian civilization. Hammurabi was the first to develop a code of law, moving justice from the whips of the powerful, to a codified system of regulation applicable to all society. It’s most famous phrase is “an eye for an eye” representing the Babylonian sense of justice.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire, named for its original capital, the ancient city of Assur (Ashur) was centered in northern Mesopotamia. The Assyrians were known for their mastery in battle and their penchant for city-building (such as Nineveh and Kalakh) and by the 9th century BC grew to control Mesopotamia and substantial territory in the greater region. In 626 BC, Nabopolasser, the king of Babylonia threw off Assyrian rule and named Babylon the capital of the empire.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire, named for its original capital, the ancient city of Assur (Ashur) was centered in northern Mesopotamia.

Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Ali ibn Abi Talib, moved his capital from Medinah to the city of Kufa when he became the fourth Caliph.\n\nThe region of Mesopotamia came under Arab influence in 636 AD and it was the Arabs who were first to call the country “Iraq” meaning “the fertile”.

During the period beginning in the mid-8th century and lasting until the Mongol conquest of Baghdad in the mid-13th century, the city became a great center of civilizations at the crux of economic and informational trade routes. Universities were established, science, math, philosophy, and medicine flourished, and literature reached its height.\n\nThe second Abbasid Caliph Abu Jaafar Al Mansur commissioned the construction of Baghdad which became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th century.

In the 16th century, most of the territory of present-day Iraq came under the control of the Ottoman Empire with the exception of a sixteen year insurrection by the Safavid’s starting in 1622. Ottoman rule lasted until the end of World War I, throughout which Iraq was divided into three provinces, Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra.\n\nIn 1920, the Treaty of Sevres established Iraq as a mandate of the League of Nations under British administration, and in 1921 Faisal I was proclaimed King of Iraq. The British mandate was terminated in 1932 and Iraq was admitted to the League of Nations. In 1945, Iraq joined the United Nations and became a founding member of the Arab League. The Hashemite monarchy ruled Iraq until 1958 when it was overthrown by a coup d’état by members of the Iraqi Army.\n\nIn 1920, the Treaty of Sevres established Iraq as a mandate of the League of Nations under British administration, and in 1921 Faisal I was proclaimed King of Iraq.

In 2005, Iraqis held their first national election through which a National Assembly was elected and a Transitional Government was approved by the Assembly. Additionally, Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum, thus making the transition to Iraq’s first constitutional government in half a century.\n\nIraq held a national legislative election of 325 representatives in 2010; the elected Council of Representatives approved a new government in December 2012. A year later, the last remaining US military forces withdrew from the country, marking the end of US operations in Iraq.\n\nIraq held a national legislative election of 325 representatives in 2010; the elected Council of Representatives approved a new government in December 2012.
