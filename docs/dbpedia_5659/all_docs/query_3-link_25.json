King Faisal had been educated in the United Kingdom, with his cousin, King Hussein of Jordan, and had reigned with British support.\n\nEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe King and Crown Prince were received by the Duke of Gloucester on arrival in Britain and rode in a train to Victoria Station, where they were welcomed by the Queen (wearing the Nizam of Hyderabad Brooch), Queen Mother, Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Margaret, the Duchess of Gloucester and the Duchess of Kent. Following the Official Welcome and the inspection of the Guard, the Royal Party rode in a Ceremonial Procession to Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhile there are no images or footage of the State Banquet hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the Gala Performance at Covent Garden or the Return Banquet hosted by King and Crown Prince, King Faisal (in the Royal Victorian Chain) and the Queen (wearing Queen Alexandra’s Kokoshnik Tiara, the Greville Ruby and Diamond Floral Bandeau Necklace, and Queen Victoria’s Bow Brooch) as well as the Duchess of Gloucester (in the Gloucester Honeysuckle Tiara), the Duchess of Kent (wearing the Cambridge Sapphire Parure), and the Duchess of Beaufort were captured at the Banquet hosted by the British Government at Lancaster House in London."
