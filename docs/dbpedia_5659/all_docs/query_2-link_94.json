        "text": "Born into a privileged Muslim family from oil-rich Kirkuk in northern Iraq, Kirdar has twice had to flee the country. Each time he wound up penniless in the U.S., where he rebuilt his life. It was when he was in college in California, \"washing dishes and sweeping floors,\" that \"I first came to understand America and appreciate its values.\" That is why Washington should listen to what the well-connected banker has to say about a post-Saddam Iraq.\n\nAlthough he's for an Iraqi regime change and the well-thought-out U.S. military planning taking place, Kirdar nonetheless warns about the \"day after.\" The worst thing the U.S. could do is handpick Saddam's successor from among the exiled Iraqis, much like what was done in Afghanistan. \"Iraqi leadership should come from within Iraq and not from outside. The U.S. government should not even be perceived as an occupying force.\"\n\nAfter Saddam and his top 30 or so murderous henchmen are removed, the U.S. should let Iraq's competent civil servants continue running the country under a transitional administration, with elections held two years hence under U.N. auspices. America should crucially help Iraqis craft a \"constitution that guarantees human rights, the rule of law for every individual and an independent judicial system.\" Ethnic tensions should be defused by allowing for elected, rather than appointed, governors and mayors. General Douglas MacArthur's genius, Kirdar notes, was that he put in place a constitution but allowed the Japanese to choose their own leaders.\n\n\"This is where I get emotional,\" says Kirdar. Between 1921 and 1958 Iraq was a constitutional monarchy with a parliament--Kirdar's father was elected--filled with minorities. \"Our first finance minister in 1921 was Jewish, and Christians were in the cabinet. Iraq had a good government under a unified kingdom.\"\n\nThe Arab Socialists that eventually produced Saddam Hussein ended this era when they staged the coup of 1958 and massacred King Faisal II and his entire family. A democratic Iraq, says the now-white-haired Kirdar, would return the country of his birth to its roots."
