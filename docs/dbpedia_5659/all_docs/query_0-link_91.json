        "text": "The forgotten Holocaust\n\nDuring World War II, my family and I were living in a modest house in Baghdad. Besides my parents, my brother and me, we had my paternal grandmother, my fathers two brothers, three sisters; one of them was married with two children and a husband. All of these people were living with us because my father was the eldest, and it was his responsibility to care for the rest of his family. He had a small engineering company that built roads and highways across Iraq. The rest of the family was either unemployed or did very little work. They used to tell us that if you love each other, you could have 10 people live in one room, and if you do not, a whole house is not big enough for two people. So we tolerated, persevered and survived.\n\nIn 1941, while World War II was going on, Iraq had a young monarch: King Faisal II. Because he was under age, his uncle, Prince Abdulla, was his guardian. They were both pro-British. A coup developed, headed by Rasheed Ali Algailani along with the army, and they turned the sentiment of the government from pro-British to Pro-German. The British had a base in Iraq located approximately 20 miles from Baghdad. The base was called Sin Eltheban, which means the tooth of a fly. It was located in a valley surrounded by low hills. Most of the land in the area was flat, and it was surprising that the British would choose a valley surrounded by hills for their base.\n\nThe new government and the Iraqi saw the location as an opportunity to capture the base. At dawn, they mounted a surprise attack on the base; the British were unable to counterattack. As soon as the British planes attempted to take off, the Iraqis would shoot them down. The radio broadcast claimed that 36 British planes were shot down that day. The British base fell and the remnant of the Allies presence in Iraq disappeared. (Fortunately, during the coup and mobilization of the army, the king and his uncle escaped to safety in England.)\n\nA pro-German government soon was formed. The Germans were elated and most gratified to have a physical foothold in a country so rich with oil. They sent a few personnel to Iraq, but no big force because they, like the British, were occupied in a vicious war in North Africa and Europe. But, they had enough advisors to direct the murder of the Jews in Iraq.\n\nThe British could not bear the loss of Iraq; they came back through an amphibious landing in Basra from the Persian Gulf. Within 30 days they reached Baghdad. During the month of the British invasion, anti-Semitism swept through Baghdad and the rest of the country, with the German-backed government arresting and killing many members of the Jewish hierarchy, using trumped-up charges and accusations of Jews being spies for the British. In addition, when the defeated Iraqi army returned to Baghdad, they, too, were determined to kill all the Jews. With machine guns in hand, the Iraqi soldiers went to Jewish neighborhoods and killed everyone in sight. After 24 hours of killing, the soldiers realized that they could now steal  as if a strange power had intervened to at least slow down the killings. They were occupied with stealing everything from jewelry to furniture. After 48 hours, more than 5,000 Jews had been slain: men, women and children. A well-known professor from the Jewish school was stabbed several times and his abdomen was cut open. He tried to replace his intestines inside and go to the hospital for help. Needless to say, it was all in vain and the professor did not last very long.\n\nThe Iraqi army carried out unimaginable atrocities: a child was sitting on the doorsteps of his home with an old amulet and bells over his ankle; they cut his leg off and rattled the bells over their heads. There was a squad of soldiers on a main cross-road corner where they stopped cars and buses, took the Jews out and executed them. Stacks of bodies were seen by my uncle when he was driving a car, and he sped away when he realized what was happening. When he came home to tell us, he was shaking like a leaf. There were many other atrocities during the 48 hours. One could not imagine what one human being can do to another.\n\nMy family and I were fortunate. Our neighbor, who was a captain in the army, was a friend of my father. He told us that we could stay at his home. He wore his uniform and said that he would protect us with his life. There were 12 members in my family between the ages of 8 and 70; I was 9 years old at the time. We all stayed at his house for several hours. Fortunately, the massacre did not reach our neighborhood. During the ordeal, the Jews tried to fight back. They had no weapons or machine guns, but they used the bricks from the flat roofs as their weapons. At the end of the two days, many of our friends and family were killed, but, thank God, our immediate family that lived in our household was safe.\n\nAll that time when the killing and the looting were going on, the British army was across the bridge. It would have been very easy for them to cross over and stop the tragedy, but they did not. The British lived with the dictum divide and conquer, so it was no skin off their backs if the Muslims were killing Jews: So what else is new!\n\nFollowing the massacre, the Haganah, the Jewish organization for the creation of Israel, then Palestine, became more active in an attempt to bring the Jews out of Baghdad to Palestine. The organization also trained and educated young men to protect themselves should the tragedy repeat itself. I was one of the trainees at the ripe age of 13. However, the Haganahs main purpose was aliyah  to help Jews immigrate to Palestine. They did this by land; they did it by air; and they did it by sea, mostly through bribes. In Iraq you can do almost anything with bribes.\n\nOne of the routes taken by the immigrant Jews was to travel east of Iraq to Iran. The Iranians, at that time, were very hospitable and allowed the immigrants to enter their country, then go to the airport in Tehran and take a plane to Palestine. They were able to do all that because the shah was in power and, seemingly, he was a friend of the Jews. A little bribe here and there also helped facilitate their travel.\n\nAnother route that was taken from Baghdad to Palestine was to go directly west, through the desert, and bribe the authorities at the checkpoint. In 1947, while all these things still were going on, I was finishing my high school in an American-sponsored institution.\n\nThere is a portion in the Bible [Torah], Lech Lecha, which means get out of here. That is what God told Abraham  to get out of there. Well, in his time, Abraham lived only a couple of miles from my residence. Believe me, you do not need God to tell you to get out of there, because you want to get out of there. My family could smell trouble in the country; therefore, they supported my traveling to the United States to continue my education. Through bribes, persistence and other means, I was able to obtain a passport in six months. The visa came from the American consulate, with difficulty. However, I must tell you that, in those days, if you had any type of abnormalities: cross-eyed, flat feet or any other major or minor abnormalities, you were disqualified to enter the United States, even if you were on a student visa. Fortunately, I was perfect. Because I was a student and not an immigrant, all I needed to prove was financial capability to go to school.\n\nIn December 1948, I was ready for the trip. It was very exciting to say the least, even though I had never traveled anywhere before. Now I was 16 years old and was ready to travel halfway around the world. The trip began with a bus ride of about 24 hours from Baghdad to Beirut, Lebanon. In order to go to Beirut, I had to go through Syria. At that time Syria had an epidemic of the plague. As a result, I had to pay a doctor to say that I did not have the plague. From Beirut, I boarded a ship that would go Alexandria, Egypt, then to Genoa and Naples in Italy.\n\nThe first leg of the trip was very frightening. I became seasick and, for three days, I had nothing to eat or drink and was constantly vomiting. The sea was so rough that a ship near us sank in the Mediterranean; we picked up the survivors. When we arrived in Naples, we changed from the cargo ship to a Polish luxury liner, the Sobiesky, and they allowed us to get off the ship for a few hours. The ruins of the war were unbelievable. The streets were filled with piles of shattered and bombed buildings.\n\nMy friends and I went into a restaurant and ate spaghetti for the first time. Following our meal, we started walking. There were houses with flashing ads  50 cents. Naturally, I had no idea what they were selling. My friends went in; so did I. To my surprise and amazement, this was a house of ill-repute that was catering to the soldiers and visitors. I ran out fast. The story I was told is that these women had lost their husbands in the war and had no other means of support. After a few hours on shore, which was very adventurous for a 16-year-old boy, we went back on board ship to America. The ship was large and beautiful, the sea was calm and, fortunately, I was never seasick again.\n\nOn a foggy December morning, we saw a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty presenting itself as a torch of light and freedom. At last I was in America, and I was free! This may be difficult to understand for people born in the United States, but for the ones who saw discrimination, killings, looting and all kinds of tragedies, freedom means a great deal. It is life from the dead. It is a breath of fresh air when you were in a room choking from the smoke. It is a burden you carried all your life, and your back was about to break, when suddenly this burden is removed. It is the light at the end of the tunnel. Now I was in America for a new life, opportunity and freedom.\n\nThis article is a synopsis of a portion of a book Dr. Sheena is writing. He is grateful to Catherine E. Stern, his writing teacher at the Jewish Community Center, for her help in editing the article."
