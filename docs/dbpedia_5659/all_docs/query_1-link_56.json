        "text": "Nameer A. Jawdat ’50 died February 9, 2012, in Bethesda, Md., of pneumonia. He was born on November 1, 1926, in Baghdad, Iraq, and prepared for Bowdoin at Baghdad College, Landon School for Boys, and Harvard University. He was born in Baghdad and came to Washington in 1942 when his father was named Iraqi ambassador to the United States. He attended Bowdoin from 1946 to 1948. In 1949, he returned to Iraq, where he was a farmer and ﬁrearms dealer. One of his closest friends was Iraq’s King Faisal II, who was assassinated in a coup in 1958. Soon after the coup, he left Iraq for Beirut, and later lived in Geneva and Vienna, working as an editor of publications for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) from 1962 to 1968. He also lived in Rome before settling in Bethesda in 1981. He wrote and lectured on ﬁrearms and issues related to the Middle East and was a member of several organizations related to Middle Eastern concerns. He is survived by his wife of 42 years, Jean Fritter Jawdat; a son, Faisal Nameer Jawdat; a daughter, May Nameer Jawdat; a brother, Nizar Ali Jawdat; and a sister, Selwa Pachachi."
