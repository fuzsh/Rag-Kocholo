        "text": "Ahmed Chalabi, the darling of the US neocons, who became the most prolific conduit of false information alleging that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has died of heart failure aged 71. Tipped by his Washington friends as the best man to succeed the Iraqi dictator, Chalabi played as destructive a role in post-Saddam Iraq as he had done before George W Bush sent troops into the country.\n\nA leading Shia Muslim, he was appointed by the Shia-led government to chair the de-Ba’athification commission. He used the position to purge hundreds of Sunni politicians who wanted to run for parliament in March 2010, thereby paving the way for the sectarian polarisation that provoked the emergence of the extremist Sunni group Islamic State.\n\nChalabi was a masterful manipulator with a mixed reputation as a banker and a politician. He was appointed deputy prime minister and briefly served as oil minister, but was never popular among Iraqis, who saw him as the archetype of the shady exile on the payroll of foreign powers. In the December 2005 elections his party failed to win a single seat.\n\nThe New York Times, whose star reporter, Judith Miller, used Chalabi as a main source for her allegations about WMDs – the newspaper later apologised for the shaky reporting – called him in a 2008 headline “Neoconner”.\n\nChalabi was born into a wealthy family in Kadhimiya, a northern district of Baghdad. His parents were Shia, but like most members of the country’s elite at that time they were secular, westernising and supporters of the British-imposed monarchy. When King Faisal II was deposed in a military coup in 1958 they left the country, and Chalabi went on to gain bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, in 1969, a PhD from the University of Chicago.\n\nFrom working as an academic at the American University of Beirut he switched to moneymaking, and in 1977 founded the Petra Bank in Jordan. In 1989 there were accusations of embezzlement and false accounting, and Chalabi fled the country before being convicted by a military court of bank fraud and sentenced to 22 years in prison. He claimed the case was politically motivated by people who wanted to discredit him.\n\nHe divided his time between Britain and the US, but found Washington more useful for his ambition to topple Saddam. In 1992 he and other exiles founded the Iraqi National Congress, which was lavishly funded by the US government to overthrow Saddam. What was meant to be an umbrella group for different opposition groups soon dwindled into a virtual one-man band, because of Chalabi’s inability to share decisions.\n\nFunded by the CIA and living briefly in Iraqi Kurdistan, Chalabi sent his men on a futile attack on the Iraqi army that the US had not authorised. In spite of this fiasco, Chalabi worked closely with the Clinton administration and played a major role in getting Democrats as well as Republicans to pass the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998.\n\nAfter Bush’s arrival in the White House, Chalabi’s task became easier. Glib and with a good sense of humour, he was pushing at an open door. All that was needed were allegations that could be presented as hard evidence that Saddam was pursuing a secret WMDs programme. Bringing forward defectors who claimed to have information from inside the Iraqi regime, Chalabi got a willing hearing, particularly within the Pentagon. A report by the US General Accounting Office revealed that he was on the State Department’s payroll from March 2000 to September 2003. The Defence Intelligence Agency continued paying him until May 2004.\n\nChalabi was one of the first exiles to return to Iraq, arriving in a US military plane in Nasiriyah before Saddam had fled from Baghdad. He was backed by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, to head a new government. Paul Bremer, who headed the Coalition Provisional Administration, invited Chalabi to join the 25-person Interim Governing Council (IGC) that was meant to put a fig leaf on the US-led occupation.\n\nBut Chalabi had little backing from fellow members of the IGC. There was a telling moment during their inaugural meeting when Chalabi took the microphone to “express the gratitude of the Iraqi people to President Bush and Prime Minister Blair for liberating Iraq”.\n\nI watched as none of his colleagues applauded and there was an equally embarrassed silence when Chalabi proposed that 9 April, the day that US Marines pulled down a statue of Saddam outside the main press hotel in Baghdad, should be celebrated as Liberation day. Even for the rest of the IGC, who owed their new positions to Washington, this was too controversial a stance in a country where most people saw the arrival of the Americans as an occupation.\n\nChalabi continued to have prickly relationships with his Iraqi colleagues. The Americans began to fall out with him after the revelation that there were no WMDs. Chalabi linked himself to Moqtada al-Sadr, who led the Shia resistance to the occupation, and developed contacts with Iran, whom he saw as the new kingmakers. In 2004, US troops raided his Baghdad home and office on fraud charges.\n\nLater that year, US officials accused him of giving Iran information on US troop positions. Nothing came of either set of charges, though they marked a dramatic fall from grace.\n\nHe retained influence with fellow Shia politicians and in spite of losing badly in the December 2005 elections stayed as deputy prime minister until May 2006. He later took charge of the controversial de-Ba’athification process.\n\nWhen Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, lost favour with the Americans in 2014, Chalabi’s hopes of taking power were rekindled. Apparently having learned nothing, the key US architects of the 2003 invasion, the former senior Pentagon officials Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, publicly backed him to replace Maliki. It was never a serious option. With the combined support of Iran and the US, the Iraqi parliament ignored Chalabi and chose the more emollient figure of Haider al-Abadi to succeed Maliki.\n\nChalabi is survived by his wife, Leila Osseiran, and their four children.\n\nAhmed Chalabi, banker and politician, born 30 October 1944; died 3 November 2015\n\nThis article was amended on 6 November 2015. In the penultimate sentence, it was the Iraqi parliament that had the support of Iran and the US rather than Chalabi."
