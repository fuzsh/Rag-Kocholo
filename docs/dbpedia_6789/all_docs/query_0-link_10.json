He was forced to sign a resignation statement in September 1992, but that resignation was not formally confirmed by parliament and he said on several occasions that he had not officially resigned. In November, after parliament passed a resolution granting that the September resignation was a result of pressure and threats, he said he would now resign of his own free will \"so that the people can be reunited and so that peace can return to Tajikistan.\"\n\nNabiyev, Yusif (Mustafa ogly) (b. 1926), chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Nakhichevan A.S.S.R.

He was also governor of Zabaikalye oblast (1901-04).\n\nNader (Shah), original name Nadr Qoli Beg, also called Tahmasp Qoli Khan (b. Aug. 6, 1698, Kobhan, Persia [now Iran] - d. July 1, 1747, Fathabad, Persia), shah of Persia (1736-47). In 1726, as head of a group of bandits, he raised an army of 5,000 to help Shah Tahmasp II regain the throne the shah's father had lost four years before. Success in battle brought the bandit power enough to restore the shah, but when Tahmasp rashly attacked the Turks while Nader was preoccupied in the east, and had to accept ignominious defeat, Nader deposed him in favour of the shah's infant son (1732), then deposed the son, Abbas III, as well (1736) and had himself proclaimed shah. Meanwhile he projected military strength in all directions. The Russians surrendered Baku in 1735. He built a navy that allowed him to conquer Bahrain and Oman. He defeated the main armies of the Mughal Empire, entered Delhi (1739), and returned to Persia with the famous Peacock Throne and the even better-known Koh-i-Noor diamond. He then led successful campaigns against Bukhara and Khiva, and the extent of territory he controlled rivaled that of ancient Iranian empires. As much talent as he had as a general, as little did he have for statesmanship or administration. His harshness toward his subjects became more pronounced the longer he was in power; torture and executions were common. The extravagant cost of his wars drained the treasury. His attempt to turn his subjects from the Shi`ite to the Sunni form of Islam cost him what little popularity he had. He was assassinated by his own troops while attempting to crush an uprising in Khorasan. His empire fell apart after his death.\n\nR. Nader\n\nNader, Ralph (b. Feb. 27, 1934, Winsted, Conn.), U.S. presidential candidate (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008). In 1965 he became famous with his best-seller Unsafe at Any Speed, a book that criticized the American auto industry and led to the passage of the 1966 National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which empowered the government to set safety standards for all automobiles sold in the United States. He then turned his attention to other consumer issues and founded numerous organizations like the Center for Study of Responsive Law (1969) and Public Citizen (1971). His fellow activists, known as \"Nader's Raiders,\" presented scores of studies on such widely divergent items as pipeline safety, baby food, insecticides, mercury poisoning, pension reform, land use, and banking. He is considered to be a major influence on the public-interest movement, and his model of fact-finding followed by lobbying is much in evidence in the United States. He was credited as the moving force in new legislation calling for stricter regulation of meat- and poultry-processing plants, coal-mine safety and health, and radiation emissions from television sets, and as instrumental in the passage of California's Proposition 103 (1988), which provided for a rollback of auto insurance rates. After running briefly as a write-in candidate in the 1992 Democratic primary in New Hampshire, he ran for president on the Green Party ticket in 1996 and 2000, winning 0.7% and 2.7% of the vote, respectively. Many Democrats saw him as a spoiler who helped to elect George W. Bush in 2000 (when his vote total far exceeded Bush's winning margin in two states, Florida and New Hampshire; by winning just one of them Al Gore would have had a majority of electoral votes). As an independent he won only 0.4% in 2004 and 0.6% in 2008.\n\nNadingar\n\nNadingar, Emmanuel (Djélassem) (b. 1951, Bebidja, southwestern Chad), defense minister (2004-05) and prime minister (2010-13) of Chad.

Feb. 20, 1901, Khartoum, Sudan - d. Aug. 28, 1984, Cairo, Egypt), president of Egypt (1953-54, 1954). A professional soldier, he held various military appointments before World War II. Promoted to colonel, then brigadier, he distinguished himself in the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. He was made a major general in 1951 and by this time had been invited to act as a figurehead for the Free Officers movement, a nationalist military group led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. In January 1952 the Free Officers helped Naguib win election as president of the Egyptian Army Officers Club in opposition to a man backed by King Faruq. The Free Officers engineered a coup that overthrew Faruq that July, and Naguib was presented to the public as the man in control. He became commander-in-chief and, after the resignation of Ali Maher in September over land reform, prime minister. When the republic was declared in June 1953, he became president. But the real power lay with Nasser. A rivalry developed as Naguib, contrary to Nasser and many of the other Free Officers, wanted to see a speedy return to parliamentary government. He also objected to the summary sentences that were passed on various politicians by the Revolutionary Tribunal. In February 1954 he resigned, but dissident members of the Revolutionary Command Council invited him to resume office. Still, Nasser steadily consolidated his own position and became prime minister in April. In October an assassination attempt was made on Nasser in which Naguib was vaguely implicated. In November Naguib was ousted and placed under house arrest, which was eased in 1960 and ended in 1971; he ceased to play any role in Egyptian politics.\n\nNagy (de Vámos), Emil (b. Nov. 16, 1871, Kaposvár, Hungary - d. Aug. 20, 1956, Budapest, Hungary), justice minister of Hungary (1923-24).\n\nF. Nagy\n\nNagy, Ferenc (b. Oct. 8, 1903, Bisse, Hungary - d. June 12, 1979, Fairfax, Va.), prime minister of Hungary (1946-47). He became the national secretary of the Smallholders' Party in 1932 and served in parliament from 1939 to 1942. After the Nazis had taken control of Hungary in World War II, he was jailed by the Gestapo in 1944 but later escaped. In 1945 he became minister of reconstruction in the postwar provisional government and in August was elected president of the Smallholders' Party, which won a majority in parliamentary elections in November. He was speaker of the National Assembly late in 1945 and in 1945-46 served as a member of the High National Council, which exercised the powers of head of state. He then became premier of an anti-Fascist coalition government and tried to build bridges between the Communists, centrist forces, and royalists. His policies, however, were thought by the Soviet-backed Communists to be too conservative, and in May 1947, they engineered his resignation. Perhaps anticipating developments, he had gone on vacation to Switzerland, where he learned of charges that he had plotted against the state. He resigned without returning to Hungary. He moved to the United States in June and was stripped of his Hungarian citizenship in October. He tried to go to Hungary during the uprising of 1956, when the government was headed by moderate Communist Imre Nagy (no relation), but got no farther than Vienna when Soviet tanks crushed the rebels. In 1961-62 he was chairman of the Assembly of Captive European Nations.\n\nI. Nagy\n\nNagy, Imre (b. June 7, 1896, Kaposvár, Hungary - d. June 16, 1958, Budapest, Hungary), prime minister of Hungary (1953-55, 1956). Drafted in World War I, he was taken prisoner by the Russians in 1915, but was released during the 1917 revolution and joined the Red Army. In 1919 he played a minor part in Béla Kun's short-lived Communist government and then went underground as a Communist organizer until in 1929 he went to the U.S.S.R. On returning to his country in late 1944 with the Soviet army, he was appointed minister of agriculture in the first postwar Hungarian government. He was interior minister in 1945-46 and president of the National Assembly in 1947-49. He was excluded from the Communist government in 1949 because of his independent attitude but was readmitted after a public recantation. In 1953 he became prime minister, but in 1955 Mátyás Rákosi forced him to resign and he was dismissed from the party central committee. In April 1956 he was expelled from the party, then in October he was readmitted and again became prime minister during a popular uprising against Soviet domination. He took no clear stand at first, but on November 4, when the Soviet army returned to Budapest in strength, he took refuge in the Yugoslav embassy and made a dramatic radio appeal to the West for help. He left the embassy on November 22 under an agreement with the Hungarian government that he would be allowed to go home. However, he was immediately arrested by Soviet security officers and deported to Romania. He was brought back to Budapest in 1957 and tried in secret in June 1958. He was sentenced to death for conspiracy against the people's republic, and was executed. In July 1989, as part of the wave of liberalization occurring in Hungary and Eastern Europe, he was posthumously rehabilitated by the Supreme Court.\n\nNagy (de Nagybaczon), Vilmos vitéz (b. May 30, 1884, Parajd, Hungary [now Praid, Romania] - d. June 21, 1976, Piliscsaba, Hungary), defense minister of Hungary (1942-43).\n\nA. Al Nahayan\n\nNahayan, Sheikh Abdullah ibn Zaid Al, Arabic Shaykh `Abd Allah ibn Zayid Al Nahayan (b. April 30, 1972, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates), foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates (2006- ); son of Sheikh Zaid ibn Sultan Al Nahayan. He was also culture and information minister (1997-2006).\n\nK. Al Nahayan\n\nM. Al Nahayan\n\nNahayan, Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zaid Al, Arabic Shaykh Khalifa ibn Zayid Al Nahayan (b. 1948, al-`Ayn, Abu Dhabi [now in United Arab Emirates] - d. May 13, 2022), president of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi (2004-22); son of Sheikh Zaid ibn Sultan Al Nahayan. He became crown prince of Abu Dhabi on Feb. 1, 1969, and head of the Council of Ministers and defense and finance minister of the emirate in July 1971. Following the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on Dec. 2, 1971, he became deputy prime minister of the federation.\n\nNahayan, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Zaid Al, also spelled Mohammed bin Zayed (\"MbZ\") (b. March 11, 1961, al-`Ayn, Abu Dhabi [now in United Arab Emirates]), president of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi (2022- ); son of Sheikh Zaid ibn Sultan Al Nahayan; half-brother of Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zaid Al Nahayan. He was already effectively in charge for much of his half-brother's reign, when he was crown prince of Abu Dhabi.\n\nNahayan, Sheikh Shakhbut ibn Sultan Al, Nahayan also spelled Nahyan, or Nuhayyan, Arabic Shaykh Shakhbut ibn Sultan Al Nahayan (b. 1905, Abu Dhabi [now in United Arab Emirates] - d. Feb. 11, 1989, al-`Ayn, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates), ruler of Abu Dhabi (1928-66); son of Sheikh Sultan ibn Zaid Al Nahayan. As ruler of the largest of the British-controlled Trucial States, he maintained generally friendly relations with the U.K. He quarrelled for several years with Saudi Arabia over the Buraimi oasis. He awarded concessions for Western oil exploration as early as 1939, and the first oil shipment left Abu Dhabi in 1962. He was reluctant to invest his oil earnings (as much as £25 million per year in the mid-1960s) in major development projects. In 1963 he signed a £5 million plan for development, including construction of a modern airport, a 70-km water pipeline, and two new schools. Although he allowed some banks to open, he did not deposit his own funds, hoarding his wealth at home, mostly in gold bullion with a few million dollars in stacks of notes. The story goes that he was persuaded to bank some of his money only when he found that part of his fortune had been nibbled away by rats. His relations with Britain deteriorated when in March 1962 the British awarded the disputed island of Halul to Qatar. According to the British political agent, Shakhbut's personal control of even the smallest detail \"would make Louis XIV look like a constitutional monarch.\" In August 1966, a council of the ruling family replaced Shakhbut with his more progressive younger brother, Sheikh Zaid, who had visited London in July. Shakhbut was exiled to Bahrain, but by 1970 he had returned to Abu Dhabi.\n\nZ. Al Nahayan\n\nNahayan, Sheikh Zaid ibn Sultan Al, Zaid also spelled Zayid or Zayed, Nahayan also spelled Nahyan, or Nuhayyan, Arabic Shaykh Zayid ibn Sultan Al Nahayan (b. c. 1918, Abu Dhabi town [now in United Arab Emirates] - d. Nov. 2, 2004, Abu Dhabi), ruler of Abu Dhabi (1966-2004) and president of the United Arab Emirates (1971-2004); son of Sheikh Sultan ibn Zaid Al Nahayan. His brother Sheikh Shakhbut ibn Sultan, who became ruler in 1928, appointed Zaid governor of Abu Dhabi's eastern province in 1946. His popularity helped to defeat a scheme by Saudi Arabia to annex the region. In 1966 he deposed his brother and became ruler. The leaders of the royal family thought him more able than Shakhbut to deal with the changes wrought by the export of oil, which had begun in 1962. He established a government structure and initiated large-scale development projects. As Britain prepared to end its protectorate over the Trucial States, Zaid persuaded five of the six other states to join Abu Dhabi in the U.A.E., a federation with a common foreign policy, which was formed in 1971 (the remaining state joined in 1972). The rulers of the emirates elected Zaid to five-year terms as president of the U.A.E. in 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, and 2001. In a reorganization of the U.A.E.'s federal structure, he brought most of Abu Dhabi's ministries into the federal cabinet in 1973. During his second term he integrated the emirates' defense forces and increased the individual emirates' contributions to the federal budget. One of his primary concerns was to use oil revenues to raise living standards. The image of the U.A.E. was dented by the failure on July 5, 1991, of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), an institution which had been founded in 1972, with Zaid's help, by a Pakistani banker, Aghan Hasan Abadi, and of which the Abu Dhabi government had bought the majority of shares in 1990.\n\nNahhas\n\nNahhas, Mustafa al-, until 1952 Mustafa al-Nahhas Pasha (b. June 15, 1876 [according to other sources, June 5, 1879], Samannud, Egypt - d. Aug. 23, 1965, Alexandria, Egypt), prime minister of Egypt (1928, 1930, 1936-37, 1942-44, 1950-52). Soon after World War I he joined the nationalist Wafd party, assuming its leadership upon Saad Zaghlul's death in 1927. As implacable as his predecessor, he was much less successful in holding his party together. His first prime ministerial term lasted only a few months. He was dismissed by King Fuad I after he introduced legislation demanded by the extreme nationalist wing of the Wafd. Returned to office in 1930, he attempted to curtail the king's power; when Fuad withheld his consent, Nahhas resigned. Appointed prime minister again in 1936, after the death of Fuad, he headed an Egyptian delegation in London and in August signed an Anglo-Egyptian treaty of alliance in response to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Continuing friction between the palace and the Wafd was early apparent, as the young king Faruq I disagreed with Nahhas over the king's powers and over international policies; after street brawls between rival youth organizations, Faruq dismissed Nahhas in December 1937. In 1942 the British obliged Faruq, by a show of military force, to appoint Nahhas again as prime minister, due to his pro-Allied position. In October 1944 he presided over the meeting of the Arab states at Alexandria which gave rise to the Arab League. On his return to Cairo he was abruptly dismissed, the British having withdrawn their support from him. His final term began in 1950, by which time the palace and Wafd had come together, which took the brakes off corruption, and popular opposition was growing towards both. Following a day of total disorder in Cairo in January 1952, Faruq once more dismissed Nahhas. After a coup in July the Wafd was broken by the freezing of its funds and Nahhas retired to private life.\n\nNahles, Andrea (Maria) (b.

She was general secretary (2009-14) and chairman (2018-19) of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and minister of labour and social affairs (2013-17).

March 1, 1908, Pae-ka-dar village, Pa-an township, Burma - d. March 7, 2003, Mawlamyine, Myanmar), Myanmar guerrilla leader. He was active in politics since founding the Mon Freedom League in 1947. He went underground in 1948, the same year that Burma gained independence. The Mons, who live mostly in the east of the country near the Thai border, are one of several ethnic minorities seeking autonomy. Detained by the government in 1948 and again during 1949-51, Nai Shwe Kyin went on to help found the Mon People's Front in 1952 and the New Mon State Party in 1958. The New Mon State Party established a small guerrilla army which suffered from splits in its ranks. It signed a ceasefire agreement with Myanmar's military government in 1995. In 1990 he became president of the National Democratic Front, an umbrella political organization of ethnic groups.\n\nNaidenov, Angel (Petrov) (b.

He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1999-2003).\n\nNaidu, M(uppavarapu) Venkaiah (b. July 1, 1949, Chavatapalem, Nellore district, Madras [now in Andhra Pradesh], India), vice president of India (2017-22). He was also minister of rural development (2000-02), urban development, housing, and urban poverty alleviation (2014-17), parliamentary affairs (2014-16), and information and broadcasting (2016-17) and president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (2002-04).\n\nN.C. Naidu\n\nNaidu, Nara Chandrababu (b. April 20, 1950, Naravaripally village, Chittoor district, Madras state [now in Andhra Pradesh], India), chief minister of Andhra Pradesh (1995-2004, 2014-19, 2024- ). He was elected to the Andhra Pradesh state legislative assembly in 1978 as a Congress Party member and served as a minister in the state cabinet in 1980-83. During this period he married the daughter of N.T. Rama Rao, the founder of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). He joined the TDP in 1983 and became its general secretary in 1985. Although he did not hold a portfolio in Rao's 1983-89 government, he came to wield considerable clout within the party. When the TDP was out of power in 1989-94, he served as party coordinator, his skillful work being a key factor in the success of the TDP in the state elections of 1994, after which he became finance minister. In 1995 he staged an intraparty coup against his father-in-law to counter the rising influence of Lakshmi Parvathi, Rao's second wife. He mustered a majority of the party to his side, forcing Rao to resign, and became chief minister in his place. He continued to strengthen the party, and in the 1996 Indian parliamentary elections the TDP made significant gains. In the 1999 elections, the TDP took 29 seats in the Lok Sabha, a performance that solidified his reputation as a leader to be reckoned with; he also won a second term as chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. He let the U.S. consultancy McKinsey write a development program on neoliberal lines and won the praises of Western leaders. He was viewed as a future prime minister by many political analysts. But while he transformed the state into an information technology hub he left millions in desperate poverty; many small farmers committed suicide. In the 2004 state elections his government was heavily defeated. He again became chief minister in 2014, after the state was reduced in size by the separation of Telangana; he was defeated again in 2019. In 2023 he was accused of having orchestrated a giant scam, misusing funds meant for training unemployed youth in the state; he spent 53 days in jail. Nevertheless the following year he made another comeback, defeating a government that hardly appeared less corrupt.\n\nNaidu, Padmaja (b. Nov. 17, 1900, Hyderabad, India - d.

March 2, 1949, Lucknow, India), Indian politician. After some experience in the suffragist campaign in England, she was drawn to India's Congress movement, addressing the All-India Social Conference in Calcutta in 1905. In 1919 she joined Mohandas Gandhi's non-cooperation movement against British rule. In 1924 she traveled in eastern Africa and South Africa in the interest of Indians living there and in 1925 she became the first Indian woman to be elected president of the Congress (the first woman was the English feminist Annie Besant eight years earlier). In 1928-29 she toured North America, lecturing on the Congress movement. She was jailed several times for her anti-British activity (1930, 1932, and 1942-43). In 1931 she accompanied Gandhi to London for the inconclusive second session of the Round Table Conference for Indian-British cooperation. Following the outbreak of World War II she supported the Congress Party's policies, first of aloofness, then of avowed hindrance to the Allied cause. Upon independence in 1947 she became governor of the United Provinces (later Uttar Pradesh), a post she retained until her death.

July 23, 1953, Kuala Lipis, Pahang, Malaya [now in Malaysia]), deputy prime minister (2004-09) and prime minister (2009-18) of Malaysia; son of Tun Abdul Razak bin Hussein; grandson of Tan Sri Mohamed Noah Omar; nephew-in-law of Datuk Hussein bin Onn. He took his late father's place in parliament in 1976 and was appointed deputy minister of energy, telecommunication, and post in 1978, at age 25. After a stint as chief minister of Pahang (1982-86), he returned to federal-level politics and became one of the rising stars within the United Malays National Organization (UMNO). He was minister of culture (1986-87), youth and sports (1986-90), defense (1990-95, 1999-2008), education (1995-99), and finance (2008-18). As defense minister, he set up the Malaysian Armed Forces Department for Veteran Affairs in 2001. In 2003 he was instrumental in introducing the National Service, aimed at instilling patriotism among youths and students. In 2004 he was appointed deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and also became deputy president of UMNO. He received the titles Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar (1976), Dato' (Oct. 23, 1978; 1983; 1990), Dato' Seri (Oct. 24, 1985), Datuk (September 1990), Dato' Seri DiRaja (April 10, 2004), and Datuk Seri (Dec. 11, 2004). In 2008, following election losses for UMNO, Abdullah announced that Najib would succeed him. In 2009 he won the UMNO presidency unopposed and then became prime minister. He won the 2013 elections but suffered a humiliating fall from grace in 2018 when former UMNO prime minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, 92, came out of retirement, formed an opposition alliance, and successfully challenged him, prompted by a scandal in which Najib and others were accused of siphoning off billions of dollars from a state development fund known as 1MDB. In July 2018, soon after leaving office, he was arrested and charged with corruption; he was found guilty in July 2020. He began serving a 12-year jail term in August 2022, reduced to 6 years by a pardons board in February 2024.\n\nNajibullah\n\nNajibullah (Ahmadzai), Mohammad, in 1986-87 also known simply as Najib (b. Aug. 6, 1947, Gardez, Paktia province, Afghanistan - d. Sept. 27, 1996, Kabul, Afghanistan), president of Afghanistan (1987-92). He joined the Parcham (\"Banner\") faction of the (Communist) People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) in 1965 and was twice imprisoned for political activities. The PDPA staged a successful coup in 1978, but the Khalq (\"People's\") faction soon gained supremacy, and Najibullah briefly served as ambassador to Iran, but was fired for allegedly plotting the overthrow of the regime of Hafizullah Amin. He went into exile in Eastern Europe until the U.S.S.R. intervened (1979) and supported a Parcham-dominated government. He was made head of the secret police (Khad) and acquired a reputation of brutality and ruthlessness among the Islamic guerrillas who fought against the regime. In May 1986 Major General Najibullah was made general secretary of the PDPA, replacing Babrak Karmal. In December 1986, he became head of a commission writing a new constitution, and under that constitution he became president in November 1987. Karmal's Parcham faction was broadly based, and Karmal's rule had given the Soviet-imposed government the credibility it sought. However, Karmal was too nationalistic, while Najibullah showed total commitment to the U.S.S.R. As the guerrilla war grew in intensity, the Soviet Union pulled its troops out in 1989. Najibullah proved Western predictions of his regime's imminent collapse wrong and managed to hang on to power for nearly three more years, attempting to gain support by relaxing his strict control, but in 1992 he was finally forced from office by the rebels. He took refuge in a UN compound. Factional fighting continued, and when the Taliban militia took over Kabul in 1996, they summarily executed Najibullah.\n\nNajjar, Mostafa Mohammad (b. 1956, Tehran, Iran), defense minister (2005-09) and interior minister (2009-13) of Iran.\n\nNakagaki, Kunio (b.

Jan. 9, 1983, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan), Japanese politician. He emerged as one of the country's most colourful figures and became a member of the lower house of the Diet (parliament) in 1963. A decade later, intent on furthering his career, he formed a secretive ultraconservative group called the Seirankai (Blue Storm Society), whose 31 members helped one another advance in the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP). During the late 1970s the club disbanded, but Nakagawa had already established a foothold in the party and in 1982 was the youngest of four candidates for the presidency of the LDP. Nakagawa, who placed last in the election, became deeply depressed and took his own life by hanging himself with his kimono sash.\n\nNakagawa, Kenzo (b. July 1875, Niigata prefecture, Japan - d. 1944), governor-general of Taiwan (1932-36). He was also governor of Kagawa (1923-24), Kumamoto (1924-25), and Tokyo (1929).\n\nNakagawa, Shoichi (b.

Nov. 28, 1945), foreign minister of Japan (2008-09); son of Yasuhiro Nakasone. He was also minister of education (1999-2000).\n\nY. Nakasone\n\nNakasone, Yasuhiro (b. May 27, 1918, Takasaki, Gunma prefecture, Japan - d. Nov. 29, 2019, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1982-87). In April 1947 he was first elected to the lower house of the Diet (parliament), becoming one of the youngest persons ever to hold a seat in that body. He held several cabinet posts beginning in 1959, including that of transport (1967-68), defense (1970-71), and international trade and industry (1972-74). After Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki resigned (1982), Nakasone, an ally of the powerful Kakuei Tanaka, won a four-way contest to become the president of the dominant Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) and thus prime minister. In 1983 Tanaka was convicted of bribery and violations of the foreign exchange law, causing an uproar that forced Nakasone to call early elections. The LDP lost its absolute majority, and it was only after a small conservative party agreed to form a coalition with the LDP that he was reelected as prime minister. In 1986, however, he led the LDP to a spectacular victory in the national elections, and made political history by having his tenure as party president (and hence as prime minister) extended by one year, though he was not granted a third term. Japan continued its sustained economic growth under his administration and became the world's largest creditor nation. In foreign affairs he sought to strengthen Japan's ties with the United States. In May 1989 he was forced to resign formally from the LDP - though he remained in the Diet - to take responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal which occurred when he was in office. He rejoined the LDP in April 1991 and was named a senior party adviser in November. He did not stand again for the Diet in 2003 due to a new party policy setting an age limit of 73 for candidates (he was 85).\n\nNakatani\n\nTaro Nakayama\n\nTosiwo Nakayama\n\nNakatani, Gen (b.

April 3, 1947, Raluana, East New Britain, Papua New Guinea - d. March 31, 2023, East New Britain), prime minister of Papua New Guinea (1988-92). He moved into the political arena with his appointment as principal private secretary to Chief Minister Michael Somare, who became prime minister at independence in 1975. Namaliu remained in government employment, serving as a district commissioner and as chairman of the Public Service Commission, until he was elected to parliament representing Kokopo on New Britain in 1982. In parliament he was a member of Pangu Pati and held the portfolios of foreign affairs (1982-84) and primary industry (1984-85). His rise to power had its origins in the instability of the government of Prime Minister Paias Wingti, which was weakened by internal divisions and embarrassed by a major timber scandal. In connection with the latter, a commission of inquiry announced findings of corruption and perjury against Ted Diro, leader of the People's Action Party, a coalition partner of Wingti. Faced by a vote of no confidence and the defection of Diro and his supporters, Wingti tried to form a coalition with Somare. This failed; Somare retired and was replaced as leader of the Pangu Pati by Namaliu. A further attempt by Wingti to join with the Pangu Pati also failed, and on July 4, 1988, a little more than one week after becoming leader of the opposition, Namaliu was sworn in as prime minister. His two main objectives were to secure constitutional amendments that would help to generate stability in the nation's politics - a move that had the full support of the parliamentary opposition - and a renewed attempt to grapple with the country's law and order problem. He was speaker of parliament in 1994-97, was knighted in 1996, was minister of petroleum and gas in 1998-99, foreign minister again in 2002-06, and treasurer in 2006-07.

After being educated at the administrative college in Dehra Dun, India, he served as an adviser to his father and led the Sikkimese delegation that negotiated the 1950 treaty with India. Six years after the death (1957) of his first wife, Palden Thondup defied Buddhist tradition and made international headlines by marrying New York socialite Hope Cooke. During his reign he and his consort sought to modernize the Himalayan kingdom with roads, schools, and hospitals. In 1973 he lost power when he pressed too hard for Sikkimese autonomy.

[plane crash] Sept. 29, 1981, near Tehran, Iran), defense minister of Iran (1981).\n\nNamoloh, Charles (Dickson Ndaxu Phillip) (b. Feb. 28, 1950, Odibo, Ohangwena region, South West Africa [now Namibia]), defense minister of Namibia (2005-12). He was also ambassador to Angola (1995-2003), high commissioner to India (2003-05), and minister of regional and local government, housing, and rural development (2012-15) and safety and security (2015-20).\n\nNamphy\n\nNamphy, Henri (b. Nov. 2, 1932, Cap-Haïtien, Haiti - d. June 26, 2018, Dominican Republic), head of state of Haiti (1986-88, 1988). Following the fall of the government headed by President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled the country with his family in 1986, Lieutenant General Namphy became president of the interim governing council, made up of six civilian and military members. His selection was not surprising. He was widely liked and respected and had a reputation for being honest and apolitical. His early weeks in power were traumatic as Haitians ceased their jubilant celebrations over the departure of Duvalier and started rioting and looting. In March, as violence swept the capital, Port-au-Prince, the most popular member of the council resigned as justice minister and Namphy dismissed three other members who had close ties with the Duvalier regime. The new council had two other members apart from Namphy himself. The council had difficulty in exerting its authority throughout the year because of frequent strikes and demonstrations. Observers at home and abroad regarded Namphy and his government as ineffective. At the same time, there was no alternative, and an election held in October for a constituent assembly to prepare a draft constitution reflected a lack of public interest in determining the country's political future. Namphy was unusual in his lack of political ambition. From the start of his presidency he made it clear that he would hand over power to an elected president. His lack of political dynamism possibly explained why support for him was waning. In January 1988 presidential elections were won by Leslie Manigat, but in June Namphy deposed him after Manigat had dismissed Namphy as army commander. In September Namphy was himself deposed by a group of young officers.\n\nNamsinov, Ilya (Yevgenyevich) (b. June 15, 1920, Mechetinsky rayon, Don oblast [now in Rostov oblast], Russia - d.

Sali Berisha's rule in March 1997, he was released from jail, was pardoned by Berisha (March 15), and again took the lead of his party. After June 1997 elections he returned to the post of prime minister, heading a left-centre coalition. Instability continued, and he resigned in September 1998. In February 1999 he also resigned as Socialist Party chairman, but he was reelected to that position in October 1999, causing the resignation of his successor as prime minister, Pandeli Majko. Majko's successor, Ilir Meta, also resigned (in 2002) after Nano accused his government of corruption and incompetence. For some months Majko returned to office, until he resigned again to settle the bickering within the party, and Nano became prime minister a third time. After the defeat of the Socialist Party in the 2005 elections, he resigned as party leader.\n\nNansen, Fridtjof (b. Oct. 10, 1861, Store Frøen, near Kristiania [now Oslo], Norway - d.

Aug. 15, 1769, Ajaccio, Corsica [now in France] - d. May 5, 1821, St. Helena), first consul (1799-1804) and emperor (1804-14, 1815) of France. In 1791 he joined the Jacobin club and soon became its president, making speeches against nobles and clerics. In 1793 he was given a command at the siege of Toulon and quickly defeated the royalists there who were aided by a British fleet in the harbour. He was rewarded by a speedy promotion to brigadier general. In 1796 he became commander of the Army of Italy and in quick succession achieved victories over the Sardinians and Austrians. In 1798 his forces took Malta and the Nile delta, but his first defeat came when his fleet was destroyed by the British navy. Arriving back in France, he joined Emmanuel Sieyès in planning a coup, which was carried out on Nov. 10, 1799; the Directory was abolished and a Consulate established with Napoléon as one of three equal members. Soon afterward he became first consul. An 1802 referendum made him first consul for life, and in 1804 he was crowned emperor. In 1805 he made himself also king of Italy (having already been president of the Italian Republic from 1802), and he put relatives in charge of various vassal states; he himself was also grand duke (1808-09) and regent (1809-13) of Berg and Cleves. The beginning of the end came when his invasion of Russia in 1812 ended in a disastrous retreat. Under attack from all sides, he announced his abdication in April 1814 and was exiled to the island of Elba, of which he was made sovereign. A year later, however, he returned to Paris and was reinstated as emperor. But when British forces, reinforced by Prussians, defeated the French at Waterloo, he had to abdicate for a second time, and this time was exiled to St. Helena in the South Atlantic. The Code Napoléon and other Napoleonic institutions still persist, as does his reputation as one of the greatest military commanders of all time.\n\nNapoléon II: see Reichstadt, Napoléon François Charles Joseph Bonaparte, Herzog von.\n\nNapoléon III\n\nNapoléon III, also called (until 1852) (Charles) Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (b. April 20, 1808, Paris, France - d. Jan. 9, 1873, Chislehurst, Kent, England), president (1848-52) and emperor (1852-70) of France; brother of Napoleon Lodewijk II; nephew of Napoléon I. He was the third son of Napoléon's brother Louis Bonaparte (Lodewijk I Napoleon) and his wife, Hortense de Beauharnais Bonaparte. He took part in an unsuccessful plot against the papal government in Rome in 1830 and in the rebellion in central Italy in 1831. After the death in 1832 of his cousin the Duke of Reichstadt (Napoléon I's only son), Louis-Napoléon considered himself his family's claimant to the French throne. Convinced that as Napoléon's nephew he would be popular with the French army, he led two unsuccessful coup attempts, one at Strasbourg in 1836, when he was exiled by King Louis-Philippe, and another in 1840, when he landed with 56 followers near Boulogne, was arrested, brought to trial, and sentenced to permanent confinement in a fortress. In 1846 he succeeded in escaping and fleeing to Britain, where he waited for another chance to seize power. After the revolution of 1848, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly and in December was elected president. The constitution forbade the reelection of the president after one four-year term, and when he realized he could not obtain the necessary votes for a revision of the constitution he carried out a coup d'état on Dec. 2, 1851. Following a plebiscite in November 1852 he established the Second Empire and assumed the name Napoléon III. In 1853 he married Eugénie de Montijo, of minor Spanish nobility. He helped transform France into a modern industrial state. In 1870 he led France to defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and was deposed. Released by the Germans, he went to live in England.\n\nNapoleon Lodewijk II, French (Charles) Napoléon Louis Bonaparte (b. Oct. 11, 1804, Paris, France - d. March 17, 1831, Forlì, Papal State [now in Italy]), grand duke of Berg and Cleves (1809-13) and king of Holland (1810); son of Lodewijk I Napoleon; nephew of Napoléon I.\n\nG. Napolitano\n\nNapolitano, Giorgio (b. June 29, 1925, Naples, Italy - d. Sept. 22, 2023, Rome, Italy), president of Italy (2006-15). During World War II he took part in the resistance against Nazi and Fascist troops, founding a Communist group in 1942. At the end of the war, in 1945, he became an official member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and in 1953 he was elected to parliament for the first time. He quickly became a key party organizer as a member of the party's national committee. His early years were characterized by unswerving loyalty to the official Communist line (e.g., hailing the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956 as necessary), but the PCI distanced itself from the Communists in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe after the Soviet army invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 and by the 1980s he had emerged as one of the most influential leaders of the reformist wing of his party. At a PCI congress in 1986, he made a speech in which he described the PCI as \"an integral part of the European Left.\" When the PCI set up a shadow cabinet in 1989, he became shadow foreign minister. He was a champion of the party's transformation into the Democratic Party of the Left (subsequently the Democrats of the Left) in February 1991. He was president of the Chamber of Deputies (1992-94), interior minister (1996-98), and a member of the European Parliament (1999-2004), serving as chairman of its committee on constitutional affairs. In September 2005, he was named a lifetime senator by Pres. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In 2006 he became Italy's first former Communist to be appointed head of state. In 2013, the 87-year-old became the first Italian president to be reelected. He resigned in 2015, however, citing his advanced age.\n\nJ. Napolitano\n\nNapolitano, Janet (Ann) (b. Nov. 29, 1957, New York City), governor of Arizona (2003-09). She volunteered as an attorney for the state Democratic Party and joined the team of lawyers representing Anita Hill at the hearings on the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas in October 1991. In 1993 she was appointed U.S. attorney for Arizona where she served until she ran for attorney general in 1998; she was elected by a 50%-47% margin in a year in which the top 5 statewide offices were won by women of which Napolitano was the only Democrat. As attorney general, she got plenty of good publicity. By October 2001 she had a 55% positive job rating, and she was obviously running for governor (Jane Hull was term-limited). She announced in January 2002. She campaigned as a \"conservative Democrat\" and was criticized as \"too Republican\" by one primary opponent. But she was able to enlist the help of the firefighters' union and the United Food and Commercial Workers to amass the necessary 6,000 nominating petitions and 6,000 $5 contributions that qualified her for financing under the Clean Elections Act. Napolitano won the primary over former state senator Alfredo Gutierrez, 57%-22%. In the general election, Napolitano relied on her record as attorney general and called for closing loopholes and cutting spending to make up the budget shortfalls; she supported the death penalty. Her Republican opponent, former congressman Matt Salmon, opposed tax increases, announced a Workforce 2010 plan to create 500,000 jobs paying more than $40,000, and said he wanted to bring God back into government. It proved to be a very close election, and she won 46%-45%. Her taking office in 2003 was the first orderly transition from one governor to another since 1987. In 2009-13 she was secretary of homeland security in Pres. Barack Obama's cabinet.\n\nNapthine\n\nNapthine, Denis (Vincent) (b.

June 10, 1957, Dundgovi aymag, Mongolia - d. Nov. 12, 2007, Töv aymag, Mongolia), prime minister of Mongolia (1998-99). A member of the National Democratic Party, he became mayor of Ulaanbaatar in 1996. He was well liked by the public, and few blamed him for the capital's mounting piles of garbage and proliferating potholes. When the government could not sell Ulaanbaatar's only skyscraper to private investors, Narantsatsralt moved the mayor's office into it. He took over as prime minister after the fledgling democracy went through a seven-month crisis period that saw parliament fail to agree on five candidates for prime minister. He was elected as a lawmaker in 2000 and in 2006 became minister of construction and city planning. He was killed in a car accident.\n\nNarasimhan\n\nNarasimhan, E(kkadu) S(rinivasan) L(akshmi) (b.

He joined the Indian foreign service in 1949 and became ambassador to Thailand (1967-69) and Turkey (1973-75) but was especially effective as ambassador to China (1976-78), helping to mend relations following a 15-year rift in diplomacy. After retiring from the foreign service, he served as ambassador to the U.S. (1980-84) as a political appointee. In 1984 he entered politics, serving in the Lok Sabha (People's Assembly) from 1985 to 1992 for the Ottapalam constituency in Kerala. He was a minister of state in the union cabinet from 1985 to 1989 and became vice president in 1992. Supported by nearly all of the main political parties, he became the first \"untouchable\" (member of India's lowest caste) to become president in 1997 when he was elected by 95% of the mainly upper-caste federal and state lawmakers, defeating former chief election commissioner T.N. Seshan. His installment came only weeks before the 50th anniversary of India's independence. Caste discrimination had not been completely eliminated in the previous 50 years, and indeed had led to recent violent eruptions, but his election was seen as a harbinger of progress in that area. He brought a rare assertiveness to the largely ceremonial post. Twice, on constitutional grounds, he questioned the government's decision to sack state governments. He also challenged the tradition that, after an election, the largest party automatically gets the chance to form a government, insisting it show evidence of a parliamentary majority.\n\nM.K.

Dec. 9, 1963, Tokyo), the daughter of Hisashi Owada, a high-ranking official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, joined the Foreign Ministry herself in 1987. When they first met in 1986, Naruhito was favourably impressed, but Owada was reportedly not interested in courtship. Marriage would mean the loss of much of the unprecedented freedom she enjoyed, and the decision was especially difficult because she would be exchanging a career in diplomacy for life in the imperial household, where the emperor's family, by tradition, lacked both privacy and autonomy. Only in December 1992 did Owada finally decide to accept the marriage proposal. Naruhito had persuaded her that her duties would be largely diplomatic in nature and promised to protect her for her entire life, an idea that was widely interpreted to mean that he was determined to guard her from the traditional, rigid ways of the Imperial Household Agency courtiers. Both were well prepared to take advantage of the experience they had in the world beyond the palace walls. A daughter, Aiko, was born Dec. 1, 2001.

While serving in the Egyptian army in the Sudan, he met three fellow officers - Zakaria Mohieddin, Abdel Hakim Amer, and Anwar as-Sadat - with whom he planned a secret revolutionary organization, the Free Officers, whose aim was to oust the British and the Egyptian royal family. On July 23, 1952, Nasser and 89 other Free Officers overthrew King Faruq in an almost bloodless coup d'état. Nasser vetoed Sadat's idea of executing Faruq and permitted him to go into exile. The country was taken over by a Revolutionary Command Council of 11 officers controlled by Nasser, with Maj.Gen. Muhammad Naguib being put forward as the leader of the regime. In 1953 Nasser became vice-premier and interior minister, and in 1954, in a complicated series of intrigues, he emerged from the shadows and replaced Naguib as head of state and prime minister.

He became a prominent advocate of Arab unity and a leader of the nonaligned states. He introduced land reforms and oversaw the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

He created a union with Syria in 1958; when Syria withdrew in 1961, Egypt retained the name United Arab Republic.
