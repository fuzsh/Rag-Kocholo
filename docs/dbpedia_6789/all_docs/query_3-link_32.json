        "text": "COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA\n\nLEADERS AND ACTIVISTS: BRIEF BIOGRAPHIES\n\nBankim Mukherjee (1897-1961)\n\nBankim Mukherjee was one among the first generation of Communist leader from Bengal. Born in Belur in Howrah as in 1897, he at first studied in Hindu School and then Presidency College. In the early twenties he left his studies at the call of Gandhiji, joined the non-cooperation movement with his boyhood friend and teacher colleague Radharaman Mitra, and toured the whole of Bengal as a firebrand Congress Volunteer carrying the message of non-cooperation to the masses. In 1923-24 he went to Benaras as a congress worker and was jailed in Uttarpradesh during this time. Under the instruction of Motilal Nehru Bankim Mukherjee returned to Calcutta in 1926 and came closer to the working class movement. In 1928 he, along with Radharaman Mitra, organised the jute workers of Bauria and Chengail in the district of Howrah and led their long drawn strike. In the course of the strike, Bankim Mukherjee ’s political outlook underwent a radical change: he embraced Marxism. During this period he also developed contact with Kishorilal Ghosh, secretary of the then Bengal Trade union federation. Subsequently he came into contact with Gopen Chakravarty, Dharani Goswami, Philip Spratt and other leading members of the Workers and Peasants Party of Bengal. Inside the congress Bankim Mukherjee was well-known as a leader of the militant section and was elected as one of the vice-presidents of the Bengal provincial congress committee. He brought some congressmen towards the trade union movement. He was one of the main organisers of the famous workers march to the Calcutta congress session in 1928. He was also famous as an orator having mastery over both Bengali and Hindi languages. His oratory, intelligence, dedication and untiring labour for the cause of the working class attracted not only the workers but also quite a good number of intellectuals of Bengal. Thus both inside the Congress and the trade union movement Bankim Mukherjee brought left and militant politics. He, along with Abdur Razzak Khan, jointed the Bengal Chatkal workers union and organised about three lakhs of jute workers. He became one of the left leaders of the AITUC and was regarded as one of its stalwart. Along with Abdur Razzak Khan, Moni Singh, Kali Sen, Bankim Mukherjee led the biggest strike of the jute workers in 1929. Bankim Mukherjee attended the All India conference of the Workers and Peasants party held at the end of December 1928 but did not join the party formally. Nor was he a member of the communist party at that time. He was, however, well known as a communist and was loved and respected as such. After the Meerut Conspiracy case he came closer to the Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India and fully and unhesitatingly cooperated with the party in all mass movements carried on in the province. He was elected to the AICC and visited many parts of India as a congress leader and as a trade union leader wedded to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. During the thirties Bengal was the epic centre of political movement – Satyagraha movement on the one side and secret and violent revolutionary movement on the other electrified the whole country. Actions of the militant youth like the Chittagong armoury raid were bursting forth in profusion. In 1930 Bankim Mukherjee, along with some communist and left minded congressmen, organised and led the carters strike in Calcutta. The police and administration oppressed the strikers as well as their organiser. Carters barricaded some areas of Calcutta and fought the police. The police opened fire on them and injured a number of them. Bankim Mukherjee and Abdul Momin were arrested. During the days of his incarceration Bankim Mukherjee held classes teaching congress boys the principles of Marxism. Some of his jail students joined the CPI after their release according to his advice. He became a member of the CPI unit in Bengal in 1936. He was elected to the Bengal Assembly form Asansol constituency in 1936 as an independent candidate supported by the CPI. As a communist parliamentarian he worked inside the assembly as a spokesman of the masses, against British Imperialism, for the freedom of the country. Outside the assembly he led struggles of working class and peasants including the strike of the jute workers in 1937. He was one of the founders of the All India Kisan Sabha and started organising the Kisans of Bengal. The radical developments on the peasant front culminated in the formation of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) at the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress in April 1936, with Swami Sahajanand Saraswati elected as its first president. The other prominent founding members of this Sabha were N.G. Ranga, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, Indulal Yagnik, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Z.A. Ahmed, Pandit Karyanand Sharma, Pandit Yamuna Karjee, Pandit Yadunandan (Jadunandan) Sharma, Rahul Sankrityayan, P. Sundarayya, Ram Manohar Lohia, Yogendra Sharma and Bankim Mukherjee. At the Seventh AIKS conference held at Bhakhna, Punjab from 1-4 April 1943, Bankim Mukherjee was elected as the All India President and at the Eighth and Ninth conferences held at Vijayawada (1944) and Netrakona (Now in Bangladesh – 1945) he was elected the General Secretary. In 1938 he became a member of the Bengal Provincial committee of the CPI. During the Second World War he was one of the campaigners against fascism and carried the policy of the party not only in Bengal but outside as well. His loyalty to proletarian internationalism was displayed at that time, when nationalist-minded people became hostile to the CPI for adopting the people’s war policy. He married Shanta Bhalerao, who was a secretary of the AITUC. Bankim Mukherjee was elected to the legislative assembly of West Bengal from the Budge Budge constituency as communist party candidate in 1952 and again in 1957. At the party congress of the CPI held in Vijayawada in 1961 he was elected to the national council. He was jailed for the last time in 1959 during the Food Movement of Bengal. He died of cancer at the age of 62 in Kolkata on 15th November 1961.\n\nMoni Singh (1901-1990)\n\nMoni Singh was a communist militant, a member of Communist Party of India, subsequently active in the Communist movement in East Pakistan and a founder of communist party of Bangladesh. He was born at Susang-Durgapur in the district of Mymensingh on 28 June 1901. After completing his primary education he went to Kolkata to pursue a secondary education. There he joined Anushilan Dal, an armed revolutionary group (1914). But after a decade he withdrew himself from the terrorist movement and joined the Communist Party of India in 1925. Moni Singh achieved his initial success as a communist organiser in 1928 when he led a successful 13-day long strike by the workers of Kesharam Cotton Mills at Metiaburuj in Kolkata. He was arrested in 1930, and on his release from jail in November 1937 came back to Susang-Durgapur. There he organised the farmers and led a peasants’ movement to protest against Tanka system. He was one of the chief organisers and president of the reception committee of the convention of Nikhil Bharat Kishan Sabha held at Netrakona in 1945. After the partition of India in 1947 Moni Singh assumed the leadership of the communist movement in East Bengal. At this stage he once again joined the Hajang peasants of Mymensingh and started a movement for the abolition of Tanka system. As this turned into an armed uprising, the government of Pakistan abolished the Tanka system in 1951. At the same time, an arrest warrant was issued against Moni Singh and all his movable and immovable properties were confiscated. While in hiding, Moni Singh was elected secretary of Communist Party of East Bengal in 1951. In 1954, the Communist Party was banned by the government of Pakistan. At the third conference of the Party which took place in secret in 1956, Moni Singh was again elected secretary. He was interned in 1967. He was elected general secretary for the third time at the congress of the party held secretly in 1968. Moni Singh sided with the Soviet Union in the Sino-Soviet split. A mass upsurge of 1969 compelled the government to release him, but he was soon arrested again. During the Bangladesh war of liberation, Moni Singh managed to escape from the Rajshahi prison on 7 April 1971 with the help of common prisoners and joined the war. He was made a member of the advisory council of the mujibnagar government during the War of Liberation. After the emergence of Bangladesh, Moni Singh was elected president of Communist Party in the second congress of the party held in 1973. In 1975 he joined the bangladesh krishak sramik awami league (BAKSAL). Moni Singh helped revive the Communist Party in 1976. In the presidential election in 1978, he took part in a campaign in support of the Democratic Alliance. At the third Congress of Communist Party held in 1980 he was once again elected president of the party and continued to hold this position until his death on 31 December 1990. His autobiography entitled Jiban Sangram (2 volumes) is an important record of the history, politics and the communist movement in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nDOCUMENTS OF THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT IN INDIA\n\nVolume I (1917-1928)\n\nVolume II (Meerut Conspiracy Case 1929)\n\nVolume III (1929-1938)\n\nVolume IV (1939-1943)\n\nVolume V (1944-1948)\n\nVolume VI (1949-1951)\n\nVolume VII (1952-1956)\n\nVolume VIII (1957-1961)\n\nVolume IX (1962-1963)\n\nVolume X-A (1964)\n\nVolume XII (1968)\n\nVolume XVII (1975-1977)\n\nVolume XIX (1980-1981)\n\nDOCUMENTS OF THE HISTORY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA\n\nVolume I: 1917-1922\n\nVolume II: 1923-1925\n\nVolume III-A (1926)\n\nVolume III-B (1927)\n\nVolume III-C (1928)\n\nVolume VII: 1948-1950\n\nVolume VIII: 1951-1956\n\nINDIAN COMMUNIST PARTY DOCUMENTS 1930-1956\n\nBefore the 1920s\n\nLetter from Virendranath ’Chatto’ Chattopadhyaya (in German) (1916)\n\nLetter from Virendranath ’Chatto’ Chattopadhyaya (translated by Baijayanti Ray) (1916)\n\nThe 1920s\n\nThe Indian Communist Party [Object, Programme, Methods, Principles], The Indian Communist Party, Cawnpore (n.d.)\n\nThe Moplah Rising By Abani Mukherji for Communist Review (March 1922)\n\nIndian Labour Movement: A Review of the Situation By Abani Mukherji for Communist Review (September 1922)\n\nSummary of the proceedings of the first Indian Communist conference, Cawnpore, (December 1925)\n\nConspiracy of Imperialism in the All-India Trade Union Congress, by S.A.
