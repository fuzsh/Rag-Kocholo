        "text": "Elamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad (13 June 1909 – 19 March 1998), popularly EMS, was an Indian communist politician and theorist, who served as the first Chief Minister of Kerala state in 1957–59 and then again in 1967–69.\n\nAs a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI), he became the first non-Indian National Congress chief minister in the Indian republic. In 1964, he led a faction of the CPI that broke away to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist) - CPI(M).\n\nThis is the official information from Wikipedia. However, EMS was not just the first CM of Kerala after it was formed in 1956. He was its first Communist Chief Minister whose government was dismissed by the Jawaharlal Nehru government under Article 356.\n\nEMS was a pivot of India's coalition politics in the later phase of his career when he moved to Delhi to serve the Marxist party at its headquarters for nearly 14 years. The leftists still remember him as it is his 111th birth anniversary today."
