        "text": "Marxist theoretician and practitioner, EMS Namboodiripad was born on June 13, 1909 in present-day Malappuram district of Kerala. EMS became active in public life at a young age by participating in the social reform movement against the caste system and social conservatism. EMS got actively involved in the anti-imperialist freedom struggle, but as a socialist and later a communist, he recognised the limitations of the bourgeois nationalist movement in bringing real freedom to the vast majority of the Indian population. His acute political insights were informed by a concrete understanding of Marxist theory applied to the Indian conditions.\n\nEMS led one of the first communist governments around the world that came to power through electoral means. Understanding land relations as a fundamental source of inequality that sustained feudal landlordism, EMS initiated radical redistributive measures in the form of land reforms that was unique in India. The Left under his leadership instituted various progressive policies including public investments in health and education that helped Kerala achieve near-universality in terms of access. Kerala’s remarkable experience in handling the COVID-19 crisis is built on this foundation of Left politics that Comrade EMS played a huge part in formulating."
