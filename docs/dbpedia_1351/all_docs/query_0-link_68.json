        "text": "Cienciano made the home team count with a victory against Sp. Cristal at the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega stadium. The local team scored the only goal of the game at 44 minutes of the second half, through Danilo Carando. With an assist from Ayrthon Quintana, the forward took the ball to the back of the rival goal with an excellent shot from the semicircle.\n\nDanilo Carando had a great performance. The Cienciano attacker shone by scoring 1 goal and kicking 10 times.\n\nAnother player who had a great game was Jeferson Nolasco. Cienciano’s goalkeeper was the protagonist against Sporting Cristal: he contained 8 shots.\n\nThe game was fought, but there were more infractions than the creation of fair play. There were 2 reprimands: Brenner and Rafael Lutiger.\n\nCienciano’s coach, Oscar Ibáñez, presented a 4-5-1 tactical layout with Jeferson Nolasco in goal; Luis Garro, Koichi Aparicio, Fernando Evangelista and Ivan Santillán on the defensive line; Carlos Beltrán, Claudio Torrejón, Alberto Quintero, Alfredo Ramúa and Didier La Torre in the middle; and Danilo Carando in attack.\n\nFor its part, Tiago Nunes’ team came out with a 5-2-3 tactical layout with Renato Solís between the three sticks; Jhilmar Lora, Gianfranco Chávez, Ignácio da Silva, Rafael Lutiger and Nicolás Pasquini in defense; Martín Távara and Yoshimar Yotún in the middle of the field; and Joao Grimaldo, Brenner and Washington Corozo up front.\n\nKevin Ortega Pimentel was the referee chosen for the match at the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega stadium.\n\nOn the next date, Cienciano will visit Sport Boys and Sp. Cristal will play at home against Alianza Atlético.\n\nNote and image source: DataFactory\n\n2023-10-23 04:23:45\n\n#Cienciano #advantage #home #field #beat #Sporting #Cristal"
