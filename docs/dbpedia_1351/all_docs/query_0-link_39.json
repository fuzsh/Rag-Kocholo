        "text": "Lima, 15 Mar Melgar de Arequipa eliminated this Tuesday from the Copa Sudamericana al Cienciano in Cusco, the only Peruvian team to win an international tournament, with a score from Argentina's Bernardo Cuesta that allowed them to advance to the group stage of the competition. The team led by Argentina Néstor Lorenzo grew strong at home to seal a 1-0 in the classic between teams from southern Peru, breaking the 1-1 parity achieved in last week's first leg match in Cusco. 19 minutes into the game, Cuesta showed all his gunner resources to get a rival scorer in the area and score the only goal of the match with a low shot that entered next to the left pole defended by Chilean goalkeeper Miguel Vargas. On the pitch of the UNSA Monumental stadium there was an intense and sometimes stuck clash, especially in the first half, when three Cienciano players were reprimanded by Colombian referee Andrés Rojas. During the first minutes, Melgar had options from the Argentine Martín Pérez Guedes and his compatriot Cuesta, who at 8 sent a header that did not enter Vargas's goal for very little. In response, fellow Argentinean Danilo Carando hit another headed shot that, with greater precision and fortune, could well open the account for Cienciano. However, before the goal, Melgar went to the front and had occasions at the feet of nationals Luis Iberico, Alexis Arias and Cuesta himself. After suffering the score, Cienciano sought the aftershock with shots by Argentineans Nicolás Rinaldi and Luciano Recalde, although at the end of the first half Melgar was able to increase numbers with a header by fellow Argentine Cristian Bordacahar. In the second half, there were offensive attempts by both teams, with deep attacks by Iberico and Carando on each goal, but also numerous fouls and interruptions of the game, to the point that at 81 minutes midfielder Arias had to leave the field of play due to injury. In the end, Melgar struggled with no luck to increase the numbers, but two shots sent by Iberico and Archimbaud lacked fortune. With Cuesta's solitary score, Melgar left Cienciano out of the tournament that brought him international fame, when he won the 2003 title, after beating the River Plate, and a year later allowed him to stay with the South American Cup, thanks to a resounding victory over Boca Juniors. - Technical sheet: 1.
