        "text": "“I praise the discipline of the players and their commitment to attend training until this date,” said the ex-AC Milan, Juventus and Japan boss. “There is no doubt that all my players will be fully ready and have the incentive to compete in the Asian Cup with all their force.\n\n“We will, undoubtedly, be very careful to instil discipline. Any player will be excluded that does not comply.”\n\nHe added: “The squad is open to any player that emerges. My door is open to each and every player.”\n\nThe Whites next congregate from August 1-18 in Salzburg, Austria. A pair of stints then follow in Spain – October 6-16 in Girona and November 6-20 in Barcelona.\n\nPreparations are wound up in Dubai/Abu Dhabi from November 6-20 and Abu Dhabi from December 15-31.\n\nFriendly matches will be contested at each stage. They will not play any fellow Asian nations.\n\nZaccheroni has been tasked to improve on 2015’s third spot under Mahdi Ali and make the final on home soil, in a repeat of 1996’s event. To do this, the 1998/99 Serie A winner will need to cure a chronic lack of goals – his charges have scored just five times in 10 matches.\n\n“I have read a lot recently about my use of a 3-4-3 formation,” Zaccheroni said. “This method won many titles at AC Milan, but I did not rely on any specific formation throughout my career.”"
