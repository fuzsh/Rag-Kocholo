        "text": "The other two awards went to AGL runners-up Al Wahda, with Argentine striker Sebastian Tagliabue winning the Best Foreign Player and goalkeeper Mohammed Al Shamsi collecting the award for Best Young Player.\n\nAl Ain’s players also littered the Team of the Season, with Essa, El Shahat, Berg and Abdulrahman also joined by UAE defender Ismail Ahmed and emerging attacking midfielder Rayan Yaslam.\n\nThe rest of the team was made up by Al Nasr defensive duo Mahmoud Khamis and Ahmed Al Yassi, Shabab Al Ahli Dubai Club centre-back Mohammed Marzooq – who despite playing in a middling team that struggled to fifth place, was part of a defence that conceded a league low 18 goals – Al Jazira’s ferocious forward Ali Mabkhout and Wahda wonder Tagliabue.\n\nAbdulrahman was somewhat fortuitous to pick up a fourth Best Emirati Player award after a quiet campaign by his standards, marred by injury. He adds the award to the trophies he won in 2012/13, 2014/15 and 2015/16.\n\nBut the Boss’ grip on the awards was as deserved as their double success, with the Garden City side returning to their glorious roots following a few barren years by their standards.\n\nMamic’s men lifted a first league title in three seasons, while a seventh President’s Cup overall, but first in four years, was lifted.\n\nAl Ain lost just once in 22 games – a joint record for the professional era – and scored 15 more goals than any rival.\n\nTagliabue was crowned the league’s best import for the second time. The 33-year-old veteran, who this week signed a new two-year extension with the Clarets, led the goalscoring charts until the penultimate round before being pipped to the Golden Boot by Berg.\n\nEventually finishing with 23 goals, Tagliabue won the award ahead of Berg and Al Wasl’s Fabio De Lima."
