        "text": "Mythical and mystical. A land that has beckoned explorers and inspired writers, painters and artists. A rugged and breath-taking landscape of peaks, valleys, plateaus, and cliffs. A nation of proud and formidable warriors long ago, distinct from Tahitians, with their own language and culture. A people where a simple smile will win them over. The Marquesas Islands is a world unto itself.\n\nLocated 1,500 km northeast of Tahiti, the Marquesas archipel ago consists of 12 islands, only 6 of which are inhabited. The Marquesas Islands emerge from the Pacific Ocean, high and lush. Nature is raw and its charm powerful. It is a land of stories and legends, as fascinating as it is unforgettable. Welcome to the Marquesas, the “Land of Men”.\n\nHenua Enana should be the name one retains of the Marquesas. Each island of the archipelago is one of the foundation pillars of a divine house, built for mankind by Oatea and his wife Atanua.\n\nThe two large pillars are represented by the island of Ua Pou; the ridge beam by Hiva Oa; the other beams and rafters by Nuku Hiva; Fatu Hiva, representing the roof; and Tahuata the light at dawn; Mohotani, the song of a bird; and all the remains from the construction became the island of Ua Huka. After the era of the gods came the era of men. However, Spanish prowess, having launched its galleons all over the world as early as the 15th century, decided otherwise. Thus the name Marquesas was given by the Spanish explorer Alvaro de Mendana in 1595, while the four southern islands, observed or explored by sailors from the Spanish expedition, were given the names of saints: Santa Magdalena (Fatu Hiva), Santa Dominica (Hiva Oa), Santa Cristina (Tahuata) and San Pedro (the black rock of Mohotani). The Northern ones were given the honour by an American Joseph Ingraham, , in 1791, who renamed them: Ua Huka became Federal; Nuku Hiva, Washington and Ua Pou, Adams Island.\n\nPosterity soon forgot those names which the Marquesans had always ignored. Meanwhile the Frenchman Etienne Marchand took possession of the archipelago in the name of France and its new regime. These now became the islands of the revolution. History takes a passing delight in these titbits, although only the name ‘Marquesas’ remains. From this administrative denomination, poetry took hold and finally we, the islanders, loved the gentleness of its name. But for you, visitors who wish to feel the history and emotional power of the Marquesas, remember this: these islands at the end of the world are called Henua Enana, the Land of Men.\n\nAccording to Marquesan legend, the creation of the archipelago represents a house built by the god Oatea for his wife Atanua.\n\nWhere are the Marquesas Islands located ? What is the climate in the Marquesas Islands ? Fauna and flora of the Marquesas Islands Economy of the Marquesas Islands The gastronomy of the Marquesas Islands What language is spoken in the Marquesas Islands ?\n\nLocated in the northern South Pacific Ocean, 1,500 km northeast of Tahiti, the Marquesas are one of the most remote archipelagos in the world. The Marquesas are spread over 12 islands (11 high islands and 1 atoll), of which only six are inhabited: Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, Tahuata, Hiva Oa and Fatu Hiva. Due to their geographical isolation, discovering the Marquesas Islands is a unique experience during a stay in Polynesia. The best way to get there, and sometimes the only way, is on board the Aranui, the essential link with the outside world for Marquesans. The Aranui will take you to some of the most remote villages in the world, which no other boat serves.Located in the North of the South Pacific Ocean, 1,500 km northeast of Tahiti, the Marquesas are one of the most remote archipelagos in the world. This volcanic archipelago is composed of 12 islands (11 high islands and 1 atoll), of which only six are inhabited: Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou, Ua Huka, Tahuata, Hiva Oa and Fatu Hiva. The largest island of the archipelago is Nuku Hiva and is inhabited by about 3000 people. The smallest uninhabited island is Motu Nui, which is only 0.36 km². The Marquesas Islands were discovered in 1595 by Álvaro de Mendaña y Neyra, a Spanish navigator. In 1842, the Marquesas Islands were annexed by France and are now part of French Polynesia. The Marquesas Islands are known as a natural paradise: here, no lagoon, but blocks of lava rising in the middle of the Pacific, streaked with deep green valleys. The Marquesas offer themselves in their authenticity and impose their difference. The Marquesas Archipelago is also known for its unique handicrafts, including tiki statues, wood or bone jewelry, carved pirogues and colorful weavings.\n\nDue to their geographical isolation, discovering the Marquesas Islands is a special experience during a Polynesian holiday (cruise). The best way to get there, sometimes the only way, is on board the cargo ship Aranui, an essential link with the outside world for the Marquesans. The Aranui will take you to some of the most remote villages in the world on an unforgettable cruise, which no other boat serves.\n\nCooled by the gentle breezes of the South Pacific, the climate of French Polynesia is ideal. Being tropical but moderate, the days are sunny and pleasant, with an average yearly temperature of 27°C, making of French Polynesia a year-round destination. With a hot, humid season during the austral summer (November to April) and a cool, dry season (May to October), the breadth of the geography of French Polynesia means that each group of islands has a slightly different climate.\n\nBeing closer to the Equator, the Marquesas Islands have a warmer and wetter sub-tropical climate than of the Society Islands. In the Marquesas archipelago, the driest months are between August and December and the wettest months are March and April, although it is frequently sunny. The southern islands of the Marquesas are the wettest, while the northern islands are the driest. The best time to do a cruise in the Marquesas Islands is between May and December-January, when there is less rain. However, it should be noted that all year round is a good time to visit the Marquesas Islands with the Aranui, the experience being above all based on the discovery of the Marquesan culture and traditions.\n\nThe flora, originating from South-East Asia and South America, and the terrestrial fauna arrived in the Marquesas by the ocean, pushed by the winds or the Pacific swell. The Marquesas are characterised by a rich endemic flora, which its isolation has succeeded in preserving and conserving to 50%. The Ua Huka Arboretum protects rare or endangered species and is home to many varieties of Pacific trees. Due to its remote location, the archipelago’s terrestrial fauna is limited. Imported from Chile in the 19th century, horses, which Gauguin was so fond of depicting, are omnipresent on the island and often the only means of locomotion from valley to valley. On Ua Uka, often called the “horse island”, one can find wild horses as well as hundreds of goats. The bird, very important in traditional Marquesan society, has a few endemic species including the “pihiti”, found on Ua Huka, the “upe” on Nuku Hiva, and the “pahi” on Tahuata. Although increasingly threatened today, particularly by rats, the birds live rather serenely in the Marquesas.\n\nUntil recently, the island’s economic activity was mainly focused on agriculture (copra, lemons, grapefruits) and fishing, but it has gained new impetus, benefiting from the income from public works but also from the exploitation of the “noni”, a fruit with multiple virtues, which is increasingly popular internationally. At the same time, there has been a real boom in the craft and tourism sectors, boosted by the international reputation that its famous guests (Paul Gauguin, Hermann Melville, Jacques Brel) have shaped. Due to its geographical remoteness, maritime freight plays a key function in the economy of the archipelago. The Aranui plays an essential role in this respect, ensuring on the one hand the supply of food products, petroleum products and construction materials and on the other hand the export of local products to Tahiti. Cruises on board our mixed cargo ship are a unique opportunity to witness the unloading of cargo and to meet the local population.\n\nIn addition to traditional Polynesian dishes, such as Tahitian raw fish, “umu”, cooked for hours in a buried oven, the Marquesas have their own culinary specialities. These include curried goat, “popoi”, a fermented paste made from taro, a tuber grown on the island’s marshy lands. A staple food for Marquesans, the fruit of the breadfruit tree (“uru”) is eaten grilled over a wood fire, fried or baked, or fermented in silos in the Marquesas. This tree also plays a role in the history of Tahiti, since William Bligh was entrusted with the expedition of 1789, which gave rise to the famous Bounty mutiny, in order to acquire a few feet of this plant to acclimatise it in the British colonies.\n\nIn addition to French, the official language of French Polynesia, Marquesan is recognised as a French regional language. Distinct from Tahitian, and closer to Hawaiian, of which it is said to be one of the main ancestors, Marquesan is composed of two dialects: “eo enana”, spoken in the north-west of the archipelago, and “eo enata” spoken in the south-east. In 1977, in reaction to a decree imposing Tahitian as a compulsory language in all Polynesian schools, three courageous teachers from Ua Pou, supported by Bishop Hervé Le Cleac’h, set up the Motu Haka association to defend their language. And in 1985, the Marquesans were authorised to teach their language in primary school, which is an exception in all of Polynesia. After two centuries of prohibition, when Marquesans were never allowed to pray in their own language, we are now witnessing a cultural revival of Marquesan heritage, proud and happy to mark its difference.\n\nAranui.com\n\nThe site, its structure and its graphic or textual elements are the property of the CPTM.
