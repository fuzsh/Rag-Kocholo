        "text": "Nowadays, it seems like any travel inspiration is paired with a warning of overcrowding and overtourism. Visiting places you see on your feed can often mean battling through crowds of thousands of others who also saw them on their feed. That is not the case with the Marquesa Islands, originally named Te Henua Enata, a group of islands in Polynesia. Just half of the 12 islands are populated, according to CNN, and don't receive too many visitors because of their hard-to-reach location.\n\nTe Henua Enata is getting more attention now that it has been named one of the newest UNESCO World Heritage sites. The main island, Nuku Hiva, is home to archaeological sites and waterfalls and is centered around an archipelago. The 12 islands are home to a pretty incredible mix of history, culture, and natural beauty. With Nuku Hiva having a population of just 9,000 people, the islands are \"virtually free from human exploitation,\" according to UNESCO, and are \"among the world's last marine wilderness areas.\"\n\n\"Through its selection of the Marquesas Islands, the World Heritage Committee recognizes the exceptional universal value of this archipelago, where we find evidence of a civilization intimately linked to its unique geological and marine environment,\" the French government shared in a statement. \"Its inclusion on the list sends a message of support for preserving the Pacific's terrestrial and marine biodiversity and for recognizing the richness and diverse cultures of our overseas territories.\"\n\nHopefully, the UNESCO designation will encourage the preservation and protection of the islands' cultural and natural life, even among people visiting the area. Overseen by the Tahitian Tourism Board, there are ways to visit the remote islands responsibly.\n\nYou can take a direct flight from Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia, to Nuku Hiva through Air Tahiti and Air Moana, which is a three-hour flight. There are also ways to sail from other islands in French Polynesia into the Marquesas. Just be prepared to spend significant money to make it to the island; it costs upwards of $700 just for that flight from Papeete to Nuku Hiva."
