All ages welcome.\n\n10:30 AM | Pacific Song Exchange “Bring Your Drums and Guitars!” Music from multiple cultures will be taught en masse, with group sharing, and a string and drum jam session.\n\n12:00 PM | Lunch Break\n\n1:00 PM | Pacific Games/Sports Exchange “Strength, Strategy and Skill” This is an interactive cultural exchange where everyone can join in and play.\n\nPena Makoare, Rangi Kipa, Ngahina Hohaia, Sian Neutze-Montgomery.\n\nWe are a collective of Māori artists whose work expresses our cultural identity through our relationship with Tōhora and Parāoa and gives life to ancient practices shared by our whānau across Te Wheke. At this momentous gathering of Pacific nations, we call for change to domestic and international conventions and legislation that impede the ancient practices of mana ariki across Moana-nui-ā-Kiwa. We also stand in support of He Whakaputanga Moana (Declaration for the Ocean) signed by Kiingi Tuheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero VII and Kaumaiti Nui Travel Tou Ariki on 4 April 2023 calling for personhood status for Tohorā as arikinui of our oceans.\n\nThis interactive talk will encourage questions and comments from the floor with support from Bonita Bigham co-Head of Delegation for Aotearoa currently engaged in doctoral studies on this subject and based in Hawai’i on a Fullbright Scholarship.\n\nWe encourage you to join us during the Festival to share your experiences and aspirations #ikanui\n\nDr. Dan Aga taught Composition & Literature at the American Samoa Community College for many years. His 1987 short story “Between Ocean and Sky” ends with the meditation “…these waves that created the poetry that created Samoa.”\n\nThis talk is about using Text, Image, & Music with a little comedy and a very small cast to perform the Samoan Creation myth. How does one stay true to the text of an oral narrative? How does one depict a God that doesn’t look like a Disney cartoon? How does one find the right balance in a bi-lingual performance?\n\nHoromona Horo from the Ngā Puhi, Taranaki and Ngati Porou Iwi is a composer, musician, traditional practitioner, cross genre and arts collaborator. He has fused the traditional instruments of the Māori, taonga pūoro, with a range of cultural, musical, traditional, contemporary and educational forms of creative arts all around the world. Te Oriori o Te Moana Nui a Kiwa will be a series of 3 sessions. Participants can come to one or more of the sessions.\n\nTuesday, June 11: A presentation of Traditional Musical Instruments of the Pacific, with the gathering and discussions from musicians/players from across the Pacific.\n\nWednesday, June 12: A workshop to build and work towards a piece of music sharing the natural sounds of the Pacific.\n\nThursday, June 13: A performance between the participants/artists involved in the workshops for this inaugural gathering of artists.\n\nZoe Rimmer discusses the new wave of working with Kelp, and language, while Western institutions still hold her people’s cultural objects captive, they continue to tell a story of ‘encounter’.\n\nIslands mark our Northern and Southern waters. The Island state of Lutruwita/Tasmania has witnessed decades of reclamation where the custodians across homelands were denied their very existence. Their practice & expression of their language - palawa kani, reflects the pristine ancient seas that surround them.\n\nMuch of their rikawa (kelp containers) are still held in the British Museum, and the Musée du Quai Branly, Paris were made by Ancestors to hold and carry water, a life sustaining resource and practice. Today, as the only known historic rikawa, they hold and carry Ancestral presences and knowledge.\n\nWe imagine who made them; whose hands touched them; who drank from them. We hear the voices and cultural memory of our Old People held within them.\n\nMr. Pasang Kincyang currently serves as Director of Dept. of Education and Culture for Council of Indigenous Peoples of Taiwan. He once served as Secretary General of Indigenous Peoples Department of New Taipei City Government and District Mayor of Wulai District, New Taipei City. Indigenous culture is an important asset of Taiwan. As the central agency for Indigenous policies, the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) is dedicated to promoting and preserving Indigenous cultures.\n\nThrough interdepartmental and interdisciplinary collaboration, CIP strives to create environments conducive to the use of Indigenous languages, promote Indigenous education for all citizens, and advance the preservation of Indigenous cultures. In addition to highlighting the unique characteristics of Taiwan's diverse ethnic groups, CIP aims to cultivate public appreciation and respect for cultural diversity. We hope the public will enhance their understanding of Indigenous cultures, fostering a society that values diversity and inclusivity.\n\nHoromona Horo from the Ngā Puhi, Taranaki and Ngati Porou Iwi is a composer, musician, traditional practitioner, cross genre and arts collaborator.

With the rise in artificial intelligence and concerns for data sovereignty, the Whare Kōrero was built to provide a safe space to share Māori and Pacific stories in ways that protect the mana and the rights of our data. Today, the Whare Kōrero provides access to news, stories, and performances to audiences around the world. It also serves as the foundation for Papa Reo and a future where Māori will build and control their own AI tools. To ensure our languages and cultures thrive in a digital society, the technologies must speak our languages. To ensure our people thrive in a digital economy, our people must be the curators, creators, and users of the technologies that represent our languages and cultures. Papa Reo is a platform upon which we've built world-leading AI technologies that will empower the next generation of Māori creators and builders.\n\nMelissa Malu is a proud Fijian/Tongan woman and is Head of Pasifika Collections and Engagement at the Australian Museum. As lead curator for the Australian Museum's new permanent Pasifika Gallery, Wansolmoana (one salt ocean) she has been instrumental in growing the museums engagement with Pasifika communities in diaspora and in the Pacific.\n\nThe presentation will spotlight the creation of Wansolmoana, the Australian Museum's permanent Pasifika gallery, illustrating how deep engagement with Pasifika communities, elders, artists, and creators led to a groundbreaking shift in museum curation. It will showcase the collaborative process, emphasizing community involvement and the empowerment of Pasifika voices through partnerships. Positive outcomes, such as the revitalization of cultural practices and narratives, and the commissioning of contemporary artworks, demonstrate the impact of this approach in empowering Pasifika cultural knowledge holders. The presentation aims to inspire global cultural institutions to engage respectfully and authentically with communities, fostering meaningful representation and cultural exchange.\n\nKylie Simeon (Ngati Kahu, Toatoa) is from the Far North of Aotearoa. She was taught by Alison Inch from Toatoa, andhas been weaving and in the Rongoa space for 33 years. She was also taught by Eddie & Atawhai Teneti. Sheʻs been a part of the National Māori weavers of Aotearoa, a member of the Tuia Mara Whenua Rongoā rōpu and proud patched member of Te Rarawa Noho Taiao.\n\nRevive and empower our people around traditional Māori medicines and healing. Explore Te Ao Māori and the power of 3. Learn about various plants and their medicinal uses including: Tupākihi, Kawakawa, Tataramoa, Māmaku, Kūmarahou, and the practice of Tupapakurau (natural preservation of those who have passed on - Whare Tangata).\n\nLyllardya Allira Houston, Liandra Gaykamangu Lucy Simpson, Cindy Rostron, Maminydjama Maymuru, Eunice Yu.\n\nMeet the Designers and Models strutting the international runway. Each design and garment is rooted in cultural integrity and sustainable values. First nations art and creativity are transforming design and culture across the Australian fashion industry. Cheekily labelled - the new black.\n\nThe story of country is the same, the mediums and expressions have shifted but it’s the telling, that continues to be passed down through the generations. The importance of each work is creating a space in the fashion world where Indigenous art and artists are now recognised, celebrated, and compensated. From working with plant-based dyes and paints, and creating fabrics with locally grown and sourced textiles. The traditions of painting and celebrating country with an eye for colour and texture is now resplendent in the dyeing process and prints on fabric.\n\nMeet our four designers. This growing sector reflects our personal value as women.\n\nFamous for its ancestral stone figures (moai), Rapa Nui is home to cultural leaders Maima and Lynn Rapu, the founders of the Ao Tupuna Foundation, a non-profit NGO created and established in Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Chile in 2016.\n\nTheir objective is to carry out the rescue of ancient knowledge such as Ancestral Navigation, preservation of the Rapa Nui language, creation of Cultural, Social, Educational and Environmental projects that involve and positively impact our community and the world.\n\nIn spite of conservation efforts, the environmental damage has not stopped, perhaps because we cannot reach awareness and an attitude of respect toward nature. Teaching environmental values from infancy is a way of generating change and ensuring that nature is seen and appreciated. Environmental ethics and ecological awareness begin when human beings recognize ourselves as a species, being part of nature, and acknowledging that our actions have an effect on other species.\n\nThinking from an eco-social and bio-cultural approach, we should integrate social well-being with the conservation of biological and cultural diversity. Ancestral navigation, as our ancestors lived and taught it, helps us understand, relive and apply these concepts from early childhood through adulthood.\n\nHoromona Horo from the Ngā Puhi, Taranaki and Ngati Porou Iwi is a composer, musician, traditional practitioner, cross genre and arts collaborator.

It’s a family obligation, a blood line responsibility to continue this stewardship.\n\nFor years in Queensland much was discouraged and forbade as Aboriginal Lives were controlled by the Aborigines Protection Act. The reclamation of ancient practices and language has seen one small island, known as Minjerribah, find a way to use the enduring traditions of their Quandamooka grandmothers and combine the ancient knowledge of weaving with stewardship for the sea country. The waste that kills their totemic associations and seabeds is being salvaged, crafted as they weave knowledge from the past into hopeful futures, bringing attention to sea pollution and its impact on their shorelines.\n\nYessie Mosby, Waniki Maluwapi & Dylan Mooney talk about their campaign.\n\nOur Islands Our homes. Yessie Mosby is a member of The Torres Strait 8, a group of Traditional Owners from Torres Strait Islands taking the Australian government to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations for its inaction over climate change. They speak about living on the front line, and the stories, the resilience and the action needed to address the rising waters across Australia’s Torres St Islands.\n\nVisionary ancestors such as Chief Bamaga in the 1940s took action by securing land on the Australian Mainland for his Sabai community, due to increasing seawater inundation levels. Now the next generation are taking the Australian Government to the United Nations. Highlighting this global threat that needs world attention.\n\n“We must look after our island, the way it has looked after us. The bosom of this land is our mother, and the water surrounding it is our father. We have to protect them, our islands our home.”\n\nAniata Kimitete and Laiza Taea, the directors of the show share that Mohuta is the name of the original tribe that settled on the island of Nuku Hiva according to an old local legend. The showʻs theme is the Matava’a, Te Au ‘I’I Tupuna (the current from the ancestors) represented by their journey to find new land on their vaka. There are 8 dances:\n\nThe Vanana: psychological preparation of the people asking the protection of the gods during the vaka construction.\n\nThe Ruu: self-introspection of the people on their future journey in their physical preparation.\n\nThe Mahau: preparation of the vaka with all the important elements we need to bring (food, knowledge, culture, education, medicine).\n\nThe Putu: Navigation starts. The weather is sweet but soon turned. The ocean gets rough and follows a battle between the gods of wind and ocean.\n\nThe Hioo: During the night the peace comes back and at dawn appears the silhouette of a bird announcing the approach of land.\n\nThe Pipine: The praise of this bird.\n\nThe Haka Manu: The land is in sight. Signs of the approaching land are also coming (dolphins, birds, debris, dirt smell…) soon we’ll arrive on shore. People are happy.\n\nThe Rikuhi: We arrived on the new land and thank the ancestors for this journey, the traditions and the knowledge they shared so we could cross the ocean safely.\n\nSteven Pigram, Darren Compton & Joel Nganjmirra & Josh Slypresent an interactive talk and workshop: Yidaki - Boomerang percussion, vocals, and elements of the song line structure. The cultural Mapping, the pathways and the trade routes were always marked in song with rhythm.\n\nSongline lyrics contained important knowledge of creation, navigation, water sources. Repeating the song cycle, lyrics and enacting the dance, cemented both tangible and intangible elements of the story. Giving the songman a full understanding of his environment and the formation of the landscape that shapes us all.\n\nToday our songmen are continuing the language and the connections – it’s a huge commitment and lifelong learning . The Muggera and Injalak dancers made the decision to continue the work of their language guardians, cultural authority’s and tradition holders.\n\nAniata Kimitete and Laiza Taea, the directors of the show share that Mohuta is the name of the original tribe that settled on the island of Nuku Hiva according to an old local legend.

The ocean gets rough and follows a battle between the gods of wind and ocean.\n\nThe Hioo: During the night the peace comes back and at dawn appears the silhouette of a bird announcing the approach of land.\n\nThe Pipine: The praise of this bird.\n\nThe Haka Manu: The land is in sight. Signs of the approaching land are also coming (dolphins, birds, debris, dirt smell…) soon we’ll arrive on shore. People are happy.\n\nThe Rikuhi: We arrived on the new land and thank the ancestors for this journey, the traditions and the knowledge they shared so we could cross the ocean safely."
