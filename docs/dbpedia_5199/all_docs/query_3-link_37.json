        "meta_description": "Taiohae, Nuku-Hiva,\r\nis the biggest and main settlement on Marquesas with population about 1600. It\r\nis also Port of Entry into French Polynesia. The\r\ntime zone here is -9.5 UTC. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBaie de\r\nTaiohae, the main port for the Marquesas, offers most services. There is no\r\nmarina, but the anchorage is very huge and safe.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAnchorage \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe\r\nentrance is straightforward and may be possible to enter at night. Keep left\r\nof  the red flashing range lights. Be\r\ncareful when entering at night, there is many boats at anchor without anchor\r\nlights.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe bay of Taiohae\r\nprovides good shelter, can be busy, but is wide and huge. There is enough room\r\nfor about 100 or more boats. Drop the anchor at 10-15 meters.The bottom is\r\nsand or mud, anchor keep good. Most of yacht anchoring close to the old city\r\npier in NE corner of the bay, where is located the best place for landing by\r\ndinghy. You should not anchor close to the new city quay (E part) because of ships\r\ncoming and maneuvering there every few days.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe bay is\r\ngood protected, there is not much swell or strong winds in anchorage area. When\r\nstrong SE is blowing the swell could make anchoring uncomfortable, but it is\r\nstill safe.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDinghy’s\r\nlanding point \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe dinghy\r\ncan be left at small old harbour located in NE corner of the bay (easy to find,\r\nsome local small boats). There is a ladder which helps to leave the dinghy on\r\nLW.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExtreme\r\ncare must be taken there (dinghy dock) particularly when there is swell in the\r\nbay. At low water dinghies can end up under the wall and many dinghies was damaged\r\nin the past. If you plan longer stay on land it is better to leave your dinghy\r\nat the ladder and then move the dinghy to the southern wall.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYacht\r\nService \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nKevin, an\r\nAmerican who lives here offer many services for yachts.

No other\r\nislands (other than the ports of entry at Ua Pou or Nuku Hiva) should be\r\nvisited before reporting to the officials.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYachts can\r\nnow clear in or out of FP with the “gendarmes” offices (French Police) which\r\ndeal with Immigration and Customs formalities. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe\r\nGendarmerie in Taiohae is located in E part of the village. When you leave the\r\nold harbour turn right on main road and walk about 5 minutes.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is\r\nthe official source from the Government of France: \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/ \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFrench\r\nPolynesia is part of the European Union (as an overseas collective of France)\r\nbut not of the Schengen Area Agreement and has its own visa rules. These rules\r\nclosely follow those of mainland France with some exceptions that\r\nare specific to FP. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUE sailors \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAll\r\nEuropean Union sailors don’t’ need a visa, and the procedure is easy going. You\r\nall have to visit Gandarmerie with your passport, a captain have to fill up the\r\ncustoms form, and send a copy to Customs in Papeete (there is a post office, the address\r\nis on the form). That’s all, you are allowed to stay on Polynesia\r\nfor 2 years. Prepare a list with quantity of strong alcohol, wine, beer,\r\ncigarettes, cigars, you have on boat (for customs form). \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNon EU\r\nsailors \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou need a “Visa\r\nOn Arrival” which is good for 90 days. Applying for a 90-day visa does not help\r\nwith the bond or your check-in process. If you wish to stay longer than 90 days\r\nin French Polynesia, you should apply for a\r\n“Long Stay Visa”. Anyway all the crew has to visit Gandarmerie personally with\r\nthe passport.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe French Polynesia Bond.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFrench Polynesia requires all non-EU visitors to either prove that they have a paid way\r\nout of \r\n\r\nthe\r\ncountry, or pay a bond on arriving in French Polynesia.\r\nThis bond basically is the guarantee that the French government doesn’t have to\r\npay to fly indigent people home. There are 3 ways to satisfy this requirement: \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1. Show an\r\nairplane ticket out of the country \r\n\r\n2. Pay the\r\nbond (roughly the equivalent of an airplane ticket out of the country) – about\r\n2000 USD. The bond is refundable when you leave, with time and paperwork. Even\r\nif you have obtained a long stay visa, you must pay a bond.  \r\n\r\n3. Arrange\r\nwith an agent to “guarantee” you. Essentially the agent guarantees that THEY \r\n\r\nwill pay to\r\nfly you out of the country, and so you essentially pay for an insurance policy \r\n\r\nwith the\r\nagent – cost about 200USD per person. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAll\r\ndetailed information you will get at Gandarmerie office. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWiFi \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWiFi: there\r\nis a WiFi (available at anchorage), name ViniSPOT, but it’s not free and rather\r\nquite slow. One hour cost about 4EUR, 20hrs – 40 EUR (payment via internet with\r\ncredit card). In 2016 the system worked wrong and with 1hr credit you can surf\r\nall the time. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA small bar\r\nlocated in old harbour provide a free internet. Ask for password. Yacht service\r\nalso provide an internet – 300CPF / day \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFuel \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe fuel\r\nstation is located on East part of the bay on the new wharf. You can berth\r\nthere for a while, but be prepared for some swell which makes berthing\r\nuncomfortable. Other way is delivering fuel in jerry cans by car (ask for help\r\nKevin Yacht Service). \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuty Free\r\nFuel \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA permit\r\nfor duty-free fuel can be obtained for free if you go in person to the Customs\r\noffice in Papeete\r\nwith your departure clearance. Otherwise, if using an agent (Kevin Yacht\r\nService), you will be charged for this service. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWater \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are\r\ntaps at the dinghy landings/ramps in port, but this water is dirty. There are\r\nthree taps in the village, where the water is filtered and available for free. Kevin\r\n(Yacht Service) can help you and deliver a water from a tap to the harbour\r\n(cost 500 CPF). Kevin have some empty containers.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGroceries: \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is\r\nfew shops located along the main street. You can buy there a fresh baguettes in\r\nthe morning. Taiohae is a great place for provisioning - significantly better\r\nthan anywhere in the \r\n\r\nMarquesas, Tuamotus\r\nor Gambiers. There is a daily fruit and veggie market right next to the dinghy\r\ndock, so fresh stuff is easy. Most of this produce is grown on the island and\r\nso isn't too outrageous in price.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGas:  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNew bottles\r\navailable in some groceries. Refilling – ask Kevin in Yacht Services. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBank: \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is a\r\nbank with ATM located on the main road.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTrash:  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are\r\ntrash bins located in old harbour. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAirport \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is an\r\nairport on Nuku-Hiva which has flights every day to/from Tahiti.\r\nAir Tahiti is the carrier, their office is\r\nlocated on the main road next to bank. Airport is located other side of the\r\nisland. If you need a transfer ask Kevin.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOther\r\nservices \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is a\r\npost office located in E part of the village (turn right when you leave the old\r\nharbour). A hospital, pharmacy and dentist are in the village.",
