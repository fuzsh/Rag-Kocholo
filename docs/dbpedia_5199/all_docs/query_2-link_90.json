        "text": "Hatiheu, one of Nuku Hiva’s largest and most fertile valleys, is an ideal setting for settlement but the valley’s early human history is poorly known. Its importance in late prehistory is well attested, with six major community ceremonial complexes (tohua) and hundreds of domestic structures (paepae). Recent excavations and AMS dating at Pahumano-o-te-tai indicate use of the area begins around the late 13th to late 14th century AD and continued into the post-contact period. Evidence from the earliest occupation suggests a structure and domestic activities, including preparation and cooking of both wild and domesticated animals, and tool maintenance and adze manufacture involving both local and exotic raw materials, as identified through pXRF analysis. A remarkable number of stone sources are represented in the relatively small sample, including the newly identified East Hatiheu Quarry (described herein), four other Nuku Hiva localities, Eiao Island and a possible southern Marquesan source. A ~600-year stratigraphic sequence of repeated burning, erosion, and colluviation informs on long-term geomorphic dynamics at this locality. Pahumano joins a number of similarly-aged sites from throughout the archipelago which, as a whole, identify the 13th to 14th centuries as a period of widespread established settlement.\n\nThe Marquesas fieldwork was conducted by the author with the cooperation of the Department of Archaeology in Tahiti, under the supervision of Maeva Navarro, director. Edmundo Edwards, who heads the project for the Department of Archaeology, collaborated with me to gather these data. Our goals are to 1) document all existing rock art in French Polynesia along with its associated archaeological remains; 2) preserve and restore rock art sites whenever possible; 3) inform the local community and to teach them to preserve their cultural heritage; and 4) share with the inhabitants the research that is being carried out. To date, approximately six months have been spent working on five of the six presently-inhabited islands. Roughly 344 panels of petroglyphs and pictographs, and 78 tiki (deified tribal ancestors) have been documented. IslandsvisitedareNukuHiva, Hiva Oa, Ua Huka, Ua Pou, and Tahuata. Due to differentgeological conditionsonUa Pou, the rock formations are most unsuitable for ...\n\nD uring the Marquesan Archaeological Rock Art Survey (1984 to 1989), over 6,000 petroglyphs, 110 pictographs, and 81 sculptured anthropomorphic figures (tiki) were located and recorded (e.g., Edwards and Millerstrom 1995; Millerstrom and Edwards 1998; Millerstrom 1997, 2001, 2003). Some forty-one valleys were visited on five of the presently six inhabited islands; Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka, Ua Pou, Hiva Oa, and Tahuata. The majority of the rock art occurs on Nuku Hiva (Table 1). Despite the robust rock art inventory, few historic images are to be found. The reason for this is uncertain: perhaps"
