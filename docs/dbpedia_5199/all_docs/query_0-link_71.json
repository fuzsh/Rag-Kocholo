        "text": "Natural beauty is on display everywhere you look on this two-week voyage through the Marquesas, Tuamotus, and the Society Islands, a dreamy realm of majestic mountains, blue lagoons, and vibrant cultures. During your journey, explore captivating Fakarava, an atoll known for its pristine beaches and exceptional snorkeling, and the utterly remote Marquesas Islands, home to ancient cultural traditions. Your adventure circles back by way of the Society Islands, including Bora Bora, legendary for its immense turquoise lagoon and barrier reef, and spectacular Moorea, with its jagged mountains.\n\nNote: This trip is not exclusive to, nor operated by, Wilderness Travel, who acts solely as an agent in booking your reservation with the operator. Please download the Rate Sheet in the Dates & Pricing section to see the full pricing details and contact our Cruise Collection Specialists to check availability.\n\nThe trip is rated Level 1, Easiest, and is appropriate for anyone in good health who is physically active. Zodiac landing crafts are used to explore the coastline and transport passengers ashore for walks to wildlife sanctuaries, scenic nature areas, and local towns and villages. There are also ample opportunities for swimming and snorkeling. Some agility is required for getting in and out of the Zodiac landing crafts.\n\nTrip Levels\n\nWith more than 200 different adventures to choose from, we want to help you find the trip that’s right for you. Our Trip Level system ranks each trip in two ways: a number rating from 1 to 6 according to the activity, and general travel rigors. 1 is the easiest and 6+ the most difficult—see descriptions below for explanations of each number. A plus (+) sign means the trip is a bit more strenuous than other trips of that level. The detailed explanation of each trip—below the bar with the number rating—is perhaps more important, specifying activities, altitudes, hiking, and travel conditions. The Detailed Itinerary, available by download or mail, gives further information. Our Area Managers can also answer questions and guide you to the trip that best suits your interests.\n\nLevel 1 – Easiest\n\nNon-camping journeys, optional walks, little elevation gain or loss.\n\nRoyal Rajasthan and Villages of India\n\nIndochine\n\nSmall ship cruises\n\nLevel 2 – Easy to Moderate\n\nHotel nights and/or safari-style camping, hikes of two to four hours on some days. Other physical activities are sometimes included, such as optional sea kayaking.\n\nOur African safaris\n\nCosta Rica Wildlife\n\nLevel 3 – Moderate\n\nHalf- to full-day hikes (3-6 hours) over rolling countryside on most days, occasional steep trails. Many of our hotel-based walking tours are in this category, as are our snorkeling adventures.\n\nTuscany & the Cinque Terre\n\nArgentina: Hikes and Estancias of Patagonia\n\nPalau Snorkeling & Sea Kayaking\n\nSome trips with minimal hiking but rugged travel conditions or long drives, such as Tribal Ghana, Togo & Benin, are Trip Level 3.\n\nLevel 4 – Moderate to Strenuous\n\nFull-day hikes (4-6 hours), mountainous terrain, significant elevation gains and losses (hiking up or down as much as 3,000 feet) on many days. Altitudes no greater than about 10,000 feet.\n\nUltimate Patagonia\n\nHiking the Spanish Pyrenees\n\nLevel 5 – Strenuous\n\nFull-day hikes (4-8 hours), mountainous, steep terrain (hiking up or down as much as 3,500 feet) on many days. Trips with hiking at average altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000 feet are in this category.\n\nInca Trail to Machu Picchu\n\nEverest Lodge to Lodge\n\nLevel 6 – Very Strenuous\n\nFull-day hikes (5-8 hours), mountainous, steep terrain (hiking up or down as much as 3,500 feet) on many days. Most hikes take place at altitudes above 10,000 feet, with some days ascending as high as 18,000 feet.\n\nEverest Base Camp\n\nClimb Kilimanjaro!"
