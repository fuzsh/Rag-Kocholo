        "text": "Government of French Polynesia\n\nBecause Bora Bora is a part of French Polynesia, a French overseas territory, the French government is in charge there. The Windward Islands, Leeward Islands, Tuamotu Archipelago, Gambier Islands, and Marquesas Islands are the five administrative regions that make up French Polynesia. The High Commissioner of the Republic in French Polynesia is in charge of Bora Bora, which is a member of the Society Islands.\n\nThe administration of the region and enforcement of French laws and regulations are under the control of the French Polynesian government. This includes obligations like upholding law and order, defending citizens’ rights, and fostering economic development. The government is also in charge of managing the territory’s natural resources and providing funds for social services like healthcare and education.\n\nA president is chosen by the people of French Polynesia every five years to lead the country’s government. The president is in charge of seeing that French Polynesia’s rules and regulations are upheld and has the authority to veto any legislation that has been voted by the assembly. The president is in charge of selecting ministers and other members of the executive branch of government.\n\nLocal Government\n\nThe local government of Bora Bora oversees the administration of the island in addition to the French government. A mayor leads the municipal government, which is composed of elected council members. The council is in charge of making choices about regional matters like infrastructure development, tourism, and land usage.\n\nThe upkeep of Bora Bora’s infrastructure, including the streets, bridges, and public buildings, is the responsibility of the local administration. Additionally, it is in charge of running the island’s sewage and waste management systems as well as providing municipal services including police and fire protection. To draw investment to the island and encourage economic development, the local government also collaborates with the French Polynesian government.\n\nThe municipal administration is accountable to the island’s citizens and is chosen by the Bora Bora populace every six years. Residents are invited to attend these sessions and offer their opinions on critical choices. The council meets frequently to discuss and make decisions on local issues.\n\nFrench Polynesian Assembly\n\nThe legislative body of French Polynesia, the French Polynesian Assembly, is in charge of enacting laws and regulations for the nation. The 57 members of the Assembly are chosen by the people of French Polynesia every five years. Decisions regarding taxation, public spending, and economic development must be made by the Assembly.\n\nAn important part of the administration of both Bora Bora and French Polynesia as a whole is played by the French Polynesian Assembly. Its members are chosen to represent the interests of the people of French Polynesia, and it has the authority to put forth and adopt laws. Members of the Assembly are urged to collaborate in order to find answers to the problems affecting the territory. The Assembly meets regularly to discuss and vote on legislation.\n\nThe French Polynesian Assembly also has the authority to approve the government’s budget and financial statements, ensuring that tax dollars are being used wisely and openly. In order to preserve the rights and interests of the people of French Polynesia, the Assembly also has the authority to look into and hold the administration responsible for its deeds.\n\nSenate and National Assembly of France\n\nThe French Senate and National Assembly also have an impact on Bora Bora’s government in addition to the French Polynesian Assembly. These are France’s legislative bodies, which are in charge of establishing rules and laws that apply to the entire nation, including French Polynesia. Both the Senate and the National Assembly, which each have 348 and 577 members, respectively, are chosen by the French people.\n\nLegislation affecting French Polynesia, such as that pertaining to taxation, social services, and economic development, may be passed by the Senate and National Assembly. These laws and rules must be implemented by the French government in French Polynesia, and the French Senate and National Assembly must ensure that the government is abiding by them.\n\nThe Senate and National Assembly also have the authority to approve the French government’s budget and financial statements, ensuring that public monies are used efficiently and openly. Additionally involved in foreign affairs, the Senate and National Assembly represent France and French Polynesia in discussions and negotiations on a global scale.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, there are several different organizations involved in the government of Bora Bora, each of which has distinct roles and authority. The administration of the region and enforcement of French laws and regulations are under the control of the French Polynesian government. The municipal government is answerable to the Bora Bora citizens and is in charge of running the island. The legislative body of French Polynesia, the French Polynesian Assembly, is essential to the administration of the colony. The legislative bodies of France, the National Assembly and Senate, have the authority to enact laws and regulations that apply to French Polynesia."
