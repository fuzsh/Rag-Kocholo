        "text": "Just 54 acres in size, Samarai Island was once an important trading center, due to its location on the southeast coast of Papua New Guinea, on the China Strait between Australia and East Asia. It was discovered in 1873 by British navigator Captain John Moresby, who initially called it Dinner Island. Five years later, the establishment of a mission station here led to its development as a bustling port town and headquarters of an administrative district of British New Guinea.\n\nIn 1942, it was evacuated and its buildings were destroyed to prevent the island from falling into Japanese control during World War II. Rebuilt since — though not to the same scale as its glory days — the island was declared a National Historical Heritage Island by the government of Papua New Guinea in 2006. Take a stroll along the pleasant pathway that encircles its pretty town, view spectacular marine life on a SCUBA diving expedition, or simply relax on the beach.\n\nThe third-largest archipelago in the South Pacific, with 992 islands, the Solomon Islands were settled by European colonists and missionaries during the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1893, the archipelago was divided between Great Britain and Germany. Among the British-controlled islands was the then-obscure island of Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomons.\n\nInhabited for thousands of years, Guadalcanal was discovered in 1568 by the Spanish explorer Alvaro de Mendaña de Neira, who named it for a village in Andalucía, Spain. In 1942, the Japanese effort to build an airfield on the island prompted six months of combat, in which the Allies were ultimately victorious. It was a turning point in the Pacific theater during World War II.\n\nThe island is still brimming with World War II relics, monuments, and memorials. Perhaps you’ll explore its tropical interior, with its excellent birdwatching. Or discover why the island is revered for its superior snorkeling and diving, with clear waters, shipwrecks, and an abundance of marine life, including barracuda, lion fish, giant clams, hammerhead sharks, and whale sharks.\n\nConsisting of 82 volcanic islands, the nation of Vanuatu lies in the South Pacific, about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to Australia. Spanish for “the holy spirit,” Espiritu Santo is the largest island in the Vanuatu archipelago. Here, you’ll find miraculous scenery, from its palm-lined, white-sand beaches and spring-fed swimming holes to lush rainforests and lofty mountains, including Vanuatu’s four highest peaks.\n\nThe character of this once-isolated island was dramatically changed forever during World War II, when it became an Allied military supply and support base. A lieutenant commander for the U.S. Navy named James A. Michener wrote Tales of the South Pacific based on his experiences while stationed here. The Pulitzer Prize-winning book was later turned into the musical South Pacific by Rodgers & Hammerstein. While here, perhaps you’ll venture to the two protected areas that have been established to preserve local biodiversity, which includes the Santo Mountain Starling, a bird that is exclusive to the island. Coral reefs and shipwrecks — including the SS President Coolidge, renowned as one of the most accessible shipwrecks in the world — make it a popular destination for divers. You can also enjoy exceptional swimming and snorkeling. Or simply relax on the beach.\n\nOne of the youngest countries in the world is Timor-Leste (formerly East Timor), which became a sovereign nation in 2002. The island of Timor was colonized by the Portuguese in the early 16th century, and Timor-Leste’s capital city, Dili, retains its Portuguese ambiance, despite occupations by the Japanese during World War II and Indonesia in the late 20th century.\n\nLocated on Timor-Leste’s northern coast, Dili is still a sleepy colonial town — but also one that is modernizing rapidly, so now is a good time to visit, before its discovery by Westerners changes it forever. If you’re feeling energetic, perhaps you’ll climb the 580 steps to the Cristo Rei: except for Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer, it is the largest statue of Christ the King in the world, at 88.6 feet tall. Perhaps you’ll stroll the waterfront in the colonial heart of town. At the Dili Tais Market, you can find a wide assortment of goods, including local handicrafts such as tais, a traditional woven fabric. The city also boasts a number of fine white-sand beaches and excellent diving and snorkeling among clownfish, zebra fish, angelfish, lion fish, Napoleon wrasse, and perhaps even a dugong, a mammal similar to the manatee.\n\nIn Fiji, virtually everyone you’ll meet will be smiling—and when you view the high mountains, lush vegetation, shimmering waters, and pristine white-sand beaches of this island nation, you’ll understand why. A British colony for nearly a century before gaining its independence in 1970, Fiji remains English speaking and today boasts a multinational population, among whom the majority are of Melanesian descent. As you mingle with the locals, you’ll see why Melanesians are reputed to be among the friendliest people in the world.\n\nLocated about six miles off the coast of Fiji’s main island, Viti Levu, Beqa Island measures less than six square miles in territory—yet it looms large among those seeking a paradise by the sea. Surrounded by one of the largest barrier reefs in the world, the island offers exceptional snorkeling at high tide, with an abundance of colorful tropical fish teeming among the coral blooms. Or bask on a golden-sand beach shaded from an azure sky by swaying palms.\n\nInland, the island is carpeted with lush rainforest laced with waterfalls and streams and dotted with villages known for their tradition of firewalking and joyous hospitality.\n\nEAST OF PAPEETE\n\nHouse of James Norman Hall • Arue, PK 5.5\n\nSee the superbly restored home where the American novelist, pilot and adventurer lived for almost 30 years.
