        "text": "Wow! Where did the time go? I did not realise how long it has been since I filled you in on what has been going down aboard Spirit of Argo. So where to begin?\n\nTHE HUMANS ARE USELESS\n\nMore on that later, but really how did these two humans ever manage to get us half way round the globe? And now we seem to be stuck on the island of Nuku Hiva?\n\nSOME HOW THEY BROKE THE RIGGING\n\nThere are all these wires, poles and clips that hold up the sails on this boat and after ‘a bit of sailing they should be checked regularily. My humans swear to me they did a full check before we left Tahiti in June, but a few cracks in the system were found after the hard sail to wind to get to the Marquesas.\n\nThankfully there is a welder here at this village. Also access to the World Wide Web. No excuse for my humans not to learn how to become novice ‘riggers’, and organise shipping in some replacement parts. Only one problem. Everything will need to be sent to Tahiti and then shipped out here in the Marquesas.\n\nAh! One more problem! There happens to be a World Wide Pandemic. With the number of active Covid 19 cases on the increase, and new ‘more contagious’ variants spreading, French Polynesia decided to close their boarders to tourism. And the airlines cancelled flights. Waiting for our parts was going to take some patience.\n\nTRYING TO KEEP MY HUMANS MOTIVATED\n\nIn the mean time I had the job of keeping the humans on task to get some boat jobs done. They are always finding excuses to go off snorkelling, diving, hiking or fishing instead.\n\nWhere do all these boat jobs come from? Sun, salt, sand and general wear and tear.\n\nFix leak in freezer.\n\nFix leak in fridge, and then sprung another leak.\n\nFind stray current in rigging.\n\nFix loose connection to one of the solar panel banks.\n\nFix all the shock cords on kayaks.\n\nStrip old paint of textured non skid on decks in preparation for painting.\n\nRestitching, replacing damaged zippers and Velcro on canvases.\n\nReplace seals on autopilot hydraulic ram.\n\nReplace seals of fresh water and sea water foot pumps.\n\nReplace seals and clean pipes on toilet.\n\nClean boat bottom, prop, chain and anchor lines, as we were stationary too long and be coming a local reef.\n\nRust removal and painting on engine along with oil change.\n\nRepair the portable Honda generator.\n\nReplace packing around the rudder.\n\nFix leak around galley sink.\n\nFix leak around stay sail track.\n\nReplace the seals on the watermaker.\n\nHard as I tried, the humans kept sneaking away on me.\n\nI have added pictures later of what they got up to.\n\nFINALLY THE RIGGING ARRIVED BY SUPPLY SHIP\n\nNow you would think, getting the rigging replacement wires up and secured would be the hard part? Or perhaps setting the new tensions would be hard? But NO! It turned out getting the OLD RIGGING off was the hardest part. It took days/weeks of lubricant, heat, vinegar, brute force and persistence. All this interspersed with days when the anchorages was too rolly to safely work above. It only took a couple of hours to put up the new wires and tension them in the end.\n\nOH YES! DO NOT FORGET THE TSUNAMI\n\nYou think you are in a perfectly protected anchorage and then an earth quake happens somewhere in the Pacific and all the island nations are on high alert. Of course my humans left me alone on the boat through the whole thing. Oblivious to the threat. I could have died! More on that too later.\n\nNow for some pictures. They always tell a better story than I do.\n\nRIGGING REPAIRS\n\nA BIRTHDAY ABOARD!\n\nTHE BOAT JOBS CONTINUE\n\nBACK TO THE RIGGING\n\nTIME TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN!\n\nWith the major repairs done I guess it was time to let the humans off the boat to have a little fun.\n\nHIKING\n\nNuku Hiva is a relatively young volcanic island. It’s steep mountain slopes make road building difficult. Just have a look at the map of the island and the ‘squiggly lines’ should tell the story. The few roads they have managed to built are steep and winding. The majority of valleys can only be reached by sea or by horse trail.\n\nThis means every hike you go on starts at sea level and only goes up hill from there. But there are many tracks to follow.\n\nThe humans started with a few hikes within the Bay of Taiohae and progressed to visiting the neighbouring bays.\n\nTIKI\n\nTiki are specific to Polynesian culture. Carvings that mark boundaries, sacred sites or areas of significance. They represent a god or ancestor and embody their mana (spirit) or power. Tiki can posses both good mana and bad mana and Polynesians are VERY supersticious!\n\nFISHING\n\nMy humans were lucky enough to meet a very nice couple who decided to retire on the island of Nuku Hiva. Both had worked for a period of time as a teacher and doctor respectively in the village of Taiohae. Daniel and Marie were kind enough to take the humans fishing. But they had to get up before the dawn.\n\nWHAT NEXT?\n\nWell it turned out Marie had some friends in the valley of Hatiheu who had horses. So the girls tried to set up a day to go riding.\n\nHORSE BACK RIDING\n\nTo get to Hatiheu Bay is no easy feet. The village is on the opposite side of the island and you need to scale two mountain ranges to get there.\n\nBANYAN TREES\n\nThe banyan tree is sacred to Polynesians. They are frequently planeted near high priest platforms (me’ae). When a chief or priest died their head was placed in the roots of the sacred banyon tree to help facillitate their souls reaching the spirit world.\n\nWHAT ELSE CAN THE HUMANS GET UP TO TO AVOID BOAT JOBS?\n\nHOW ABOUT SOME DIVING?\n\nTHE HUMANS GOT UP TO SOME MORE HIKING\n\nIt turns out there is a ceremonial site right in the valley of Taiohae, where we were anchored. Only trouble is the humans always got lost on the trails before they find it.\n\nTOHUA KOUEVA\n\nBut, finally they stumbled on the right turning.\n\nAND EVEN MORE HIKES TO AVOID BOAT WORK!\n\nDANIEL’S BAY TO TAIOHAE BAY\n\nThis time the humans attempted the full day hike from Hakatea Bay (Daniel’s Bay) back to Taiohae Bay.\n\nThe two bays are separated by an impressive mountain range. Only the sea and horse tracks connect the two valleys. Marie joined us on this adventure and Daniel was nice enough to drop us off in his fishing boat.\n\nMAKING FRIENDS\n\nLiving a transient life style, my humans tell me, it is not always easy to make new friends. It is great when my humans do find people that have common interests and enjoy doing similar things.\n\nWhen the humans do make new friends they always bring back new stories and a better understanding of the world and the people living in it.\n\nBUT DO NOT FORGET ABOUT ME!\n\nTSUNAMI WARNING\n\nWhile the humans were off the boat having their ‘human’ fun there was a big earth quake in the South Pacific. It sent shock waves radiating out and many of the island nations, including French Polynesia, were put on ALERT.\n\nWell of course the tsunami hit! Luckily it was less than a metre. The water initially dropped, with the shore line becoming exposed, 10m or more, past the low tide line. Then, in a series of wavelettes, the water returned a metre or so further up the beach from where it started. The bay water level continued to surge in and out for an hour or more before dark, but never as dramatic as the first time.\n\nSo somehow, despite the humans making all the wrong choices, I have survived my first Pacific tsunami.\n\nWhat will these humans put me through next?"
