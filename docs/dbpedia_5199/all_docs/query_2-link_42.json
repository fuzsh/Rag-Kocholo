        "text": "With its beautiful 118 tropical islands, French Polynesia is a true paradise in the South Pacific.\n\nOnly 67 of these idyllic islands are inhabited and offer unique habitats. The islands are spread across five different archipelagos and cover an area the size of Europe.\n\nJoin us on our unforgettable, varied dream trip through one of the most breathtaking regions our world has to offer... French Polynesia.\n\nOn our 3-week trip through the incomparable island world of French Polynesia, we visit the most beautiful but also the most hidden places you can only dream of. Fulfill the dream that is on every diver's wish list and join us on our incomparable dream trip to the islands of Tahiti, Rurutu, Bora Bora, Rangiroa & Fakarava.\n\nAll those for whom 3 weeks on this indescribably beautiful piece of earth are not enough, are welcome to accompany us to the\n\nMarquesas - a land full of stories and legends.\n\nThe largest island in French Polynesia is considered the epitome of paradise all over the world, and with good reason. With its incomparable combination of imposing mountain landscapes, deep valleys, breathtaking coral reefs, crystal-clear waters and majestic waterfalls, the island presents itself as a truly idyllic paradise.\n\nTahiti is also home to the bustling & colorful capital Papeete. In addition to the famous city market, historic government buildings and the pearl museum, this is the place to experience true Polynesian nightlife.\n\nThis is also where our dream journey through French Polynesia begins, where we will spend the first night.\n\nAccommodation: Intercontinental Tahiti Resort **** in a double room with Garden View\n\nCatering: Breakfast included\n\nWe also return to Tahiti after the first stage of our trip, where a fantastic round trip is on the program. We visit the larger western part 'Tahiti Nui' and 'Tahiti Iti' - the smaller eastern peninsula.\n\nThe next day we continue to one of the most exciting destinations in the South Pacific - Rurutu.\n\nRurutu is the northernmost island of French Polynesia, located about 550 km from Tahiti and is also known as the island of whales.\n\nBetween July and October, the humpback whales migrate to the warm waters of Rurutu to mate and calve. Whale mothers move around the island with their calves to nurse them until they are big enough to move on to the Antarctic. An encounter with these majestic marine mammals in 28° warm water and visibility of up to 80 meters is definitely a unique highlight that no diver or snorkeler will ever forget.\n\nYves Lefèvre, one of the most famous marine biologists, whale researcher and former cameraman of Jacques Cousteau, has settled in French Polynesia and will accompany us with his team on Rurutu and also lead our dives on Rangiroa.\n\nRurutu is our second stay, where we will spend 5 nights.\n\nAccommodation: Vaitumu Village *** in Garden Bungalow\n\nCatering: Half board included\n\nBora Bora is undoubtedly the most famous of all the islands, the epitome of the South Seas and enchants with its breathtaking lagoons in the most varied shades of blue.\n\nMont Otemanu, a 727m high dormant volcano, lies at the center of the exotic island surrounded by tropical vegetation.\n\nIn the crystal-clear lagoon with its fascinating and untouched underwater world, you can experience the biodiversity and magic of the South Pacific up close. You can encounter colorful schools of fish close to the beach, while sharks, barracudas and rays make their home in the deeper waters. Particularly impressive is the large number of manta rays and leopard rays that can be found in the lagoon's so-called \"ray strait\".\n\nA visit to the exclusive island of Bora Bora is an absolute MUST and is therefore included in our program as the third destination that we will visit as part of our atoll pass.\n\nAccommodation: Hotel Maitai Polynesia *** in a double room with Ocean View\n\nCatering: Breakfast included\n\nRangiroa with its 240 islands is the world's second largest atoll with the enchanting name \"endless sky\", is known worldwide for its breathtaking dive sites and attracts the attention of all diving enthusiasts. Rangiroa is an idyllic place that surpasses human imagination and transports its visitors to another world far away from the hustle and bustle.\n\nThe Rangiroas North Pass is one of the most famous dive sites in Polynesia. The drift dives, on which Yves Lefèvre will again accompany us, will be carried out in the North & South Pass. Here you will encounter countless grey sharks, hammerhead sharks, oceanic blacktips, manta rays, dolphins and colorful schools of fish.\n\nRangiroa is the fourth stop on our journey.\n\nAccommodation: Kia Ora Resort **** in a beach bungalow with whirlpool\n\nCatering: Breakfast included\n\nFakarava resembles a small atoll in the Maldives, has been declared a UNESCO biosphere reserve together with its neighboring atolls and boasts an extremely rare flora and fauna.\n\nNever before has a diver seen so many sharks as in the Fakarava South Pass, for which it is world-famous. In addition to the sharks, colorful corals of various species can be found right down to the shallows. Large schools of tuna and gigantic barracuda, reef sharks, nurse sharks and Napoleon fish can also be encountered while diving here.\n\nFakarava is our fifth destination before heading back to Tahiti and optionally on to the Marquesas.\n\nAccommodation: Pension Raimiti *** in Robinson Bungalow\n\nCatering: Full board included\n\nThe simple but very cozy Pension Raimiti is a very special Polynesian family pension away from the tourist crowds, very romantic and particularly suitable for divers, as it is located directly on the South Pass\n\nThe Marquesas are a land filled with stories & legends and geographically belong to the East Polynesian islands, south of the equator. The legend tells of God who created a \"great house\" at the top of all the islands, represented by the largest of them - Nuku Hiva.\n\nThe archipelago with 12 islands and numerous small islets is divided into a northern group with the main islands of Nuku Hiva, Ua Pou and Ua Huka and a southern group with Hiva Oa, Tahuata and Fatu Hiva. The Marquesas are still largely unexplored in terms of diving.\n\nThe underwater world is full of exciting treasures and amazing biodiversity. Manta rays, eagle rays, sharks, mackerel, tuna, swordfish and many other sea creatures can be observed along the coast. With a bit of luck, you might even come across some of the hundreds of dolphins that frolic along the south-east coast of Nuku Hiva.\n\nWe visit Nuku Hiva as our seventh stay, not only to explore the diving, but also the beautiful landscape. The local program includes 4 dives and 3 shore excursions.\n\nAccommodation: Nuku Hiva by Pearl Resort *** in a bungalow overlooking the bay\n\nCatering: Half board included\n\nDue to its fertile and lush land, the island of Hiva Oa is now known as the \"Garden of the Marquesas\". The island is characterized by a rugged landscape and, with a bit of luck, you might stumble across one of the many archaeological sites that are still largely hidden even after hundreds of years. The island is also home to the largest Tiki statues in the Tahiti Islands.\n\nBefore our wonderful trip comes to an end with Hiva Oa as our eighth stay, we will get to know the island better with 2 dives & 2 land excursions.\n\nAfter 4 weeks of total travel time, we will return to Tahiti, from where we will start our journey home the same evening.\n\nAccommodation: Hiva Oa Hanakee Lodge *** in an Ocean Bungalow\n\nCatering: Half board included\n\nMaldives and More is your trusted travel partner with over 30 years of experience in tourism, ensuring that your stay in the Maldives is unforgettable. With our passion for diving and our own liveaboard on site, we can rightly say that we know the area like the back of our hand!\n\nWe take care of all the details of your trip. Entrust us with your travel dreams and let us make your dream come true together."
