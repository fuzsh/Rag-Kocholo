        "text": "French Polynesia is easily my no 1 favorite place in the world! I have been four times and am already dying to return back to explore more. The destination is a group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean that is an overseas collectivity of France. It is made up of 118 islands and atolls, spread out over an area of about 2,000,000 square miles. The islands are split into 5 main archipelagos – each with their own distinct characteristic features which makes this destination as a whole so unique and diverse.\n\n“French Polynesia” is also interchangeably called “Tahiti”. Tahiti has 5 main archipelagos : The Society islands, the Tuamotus, The Marquesas, The Austral islands and the Gambier islands. The most popular island group is the Society Island group which also has islands that you have probably heard of such as – Tahiti (the capital), Bora Bora, Moorea, etc.\n\nThe islands of Tahiti are as mystical as they are dreamy, and are best known for their beautiful white sand beaches, crystal clear waters, incredible marine life and lush vegetation. They are a popular destination for tourists looking to relax and enjoy the tropical climate, as well as for those interested in watersports such as snorkeling, diving and surfing, as well as those who want to discover remote untouched isles off the beaten path.\n\nI have been to 9 islands so far and plan on returning back to more so I will share this brief travel guide as an overview for French Polynesia and keep adding to it as and when we visit other islands, so definitely bookmark this blog post!\n\nHow to get there?\n\nColorful cabin of Air Tahiti Nui\n\nIf you are headed to French Polynesia from any international destination, you will be first be flying into Papeete airport that is located on the main island of Tahiti. While booking tickets look for the airline code PPT. If you are flying from the US, it is closer than you think especially from the west coast – just a 7.5 hour direct flight from SF/LA/Seattle ! If you fly from :\n\nLAX or SEA – Air Tahiti Nui is your best option from LA or Seattle\n\nSFO – United is your best option ( Frenchbee also flies direct from SFO but I prefer United )\n\nOnce you get to Tahiti – you might have a few hours or an overnight to kill, if the main island of Tahiti isn’t your final destination. You may find yourself on an international flight that either arrives to Papeete late in the evening OR departs from Papeete super late at night (on your way back). Most people just stay here for a few hours or a quick overnight before flying out or taking a ferry to the to the other islands such as Bora Bora, Moorea and so on. If you are going to be in Tahiti for a few hours before or after your island hopping adventure and need a quick guide on what do in Tahiti – check out my 24 HOURS IN TAHITI travel guide for more!\n\nIsland hopping in French Polynesia :\n\nIf you are going to Moorea, you can take an easy 30 min ferry ride via Aremiti or Terevau ferry from Tahiti. But if you are going to any other islands in French Polynesia you will have to take a domestic flight via the main domestic carrier Air Tahiti (* don’t confuse this with Air Tahiti Nui). Air Tahiti is the main carrier in French Polynesia, and covers a network as vast as Europe ( thats how vast the entire islands of Tahiti are spread!)\n\nAir Tahiti flies to 48 of the 118 islands, since not all of the islands have airports. If you are headed to islands without airports you might have to also do an additional boat transfer after the domestic flight. Depending on what islands you choose in your itinerary, you could either choose to fly between them directly or via the main airport at Papeete in Tahiti. This all depends on the Air tahiti schedule that releases every few months at a time. They also have multi island passes that they sell which work out to be very economical if you are island hopping a lot. I know it sounds complicated but its really not, and if you are staying with a hotel their concierge would be more than happy to assist you with booking transfers. Also in my experience it is very difficult to modify or change reservations so its best to book your internal flights only once you are absolutely sure of dates.\n\nThe newest domestic airline in Tahiti is Air Moana which also offers flights to many destinations across French Polynesia. While they don’t cover as many destinations, they do offer competitive pricing, inflight entertainment, assigned seating among other perks. Definitely check out both to compare to see what might work best for you.\n\nBest time to visit :\n\nHigh season runs from May to October and is usually the best time to go due to less rainfall and incredible weather. High season also means expensive rooms, flights and everything else in general.\n\nFor this reason – you can also consider going in the shoulder months of April or November.\n\nThe first time we went we went in the high season and had a mix of sun and rain. For our second time we took a chance and went in the shoulder season and actually had even better weather! So it really depends on luck. But if its your first time going there, I would recommend going during the high season.\n\nHow long to spend :\n\nI would recommend a minimum of 3-4 days per island that you are visiting. If you are going to just 1 or 2 islands, you can spend atleast 5 days per island to make it more relaxed.\n\nUseful things to know :\n\nIslands we have been to :\n\nWith 118 islands to choose from among 5 incredible archipelagos there is something for everyone! Whether you are a first timer or a repeat island hopper like us, French Polynesia will enchant you like no other destination with her unbeatable beauty.\n\nIf you are a first timer I would recommend the 3 most popular islands of Tahiti – Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora. Here is a brief overview of all the islands we have to so far in Tahiti; I will update this list as and when we visit more.\n\nISLAND 1 : TAHITI\n\nIntro to Tahiti\n\nTahiti is the largest and most populated island in all of French Polynesia. It is also the capital of the country. If you are headed to French Polynesia from any international destination, you will be first be flying into Papette airport that is located on the main island of Tahiti. Most people just stay here for a few hours or a quick overnight before flying out or taking a ferry to the to the other islands such as Bora Bora, Moorea and so on.\n\nWhere to Stay in Tahiti\n\nWe loved staying at the beautiful Le Tahiti by Pearl resorts. We are huge fans of the Pearl resort brands as its one of the few luxury brands from French Polynesia itself and manage to tie in the luxury aspect with authentic island charm and hospitality so well. Le Tahiti sits on one of the most beautiful black sand beaches in Tahiti. Their rooms are spacious and updated. We loved being able to shower, get a good rest, use their facilities like the pool/gym and get dinner just before our late night flight out. It is the perfect option if you find yourself in Tahiti for a day or two at the beginning or end of your trip.\n\nThe Intercontinental Tahiti Resort and Spa is another option and is conveniently located 10 min from the airport. You may find yourself on an international flight that either arrives to Papette late in the evening OR departs from Papette super late at night; so this resort is ideal especially for this reason. It is a beautiful resort for a complete stay in Tahiti, but also a great option if you just want a place for a few hours with clean basic rooms, a hot shower, food and other amenities if you have time.\n\nThings to not miss in Tahiti\n\nBlack sand beaches : The island of Tahiti is famous for its stunning black sand beaches and one of my favorite ones that we stopped at was Taharuu beach.\n\nPapeete market : A must visit is the Papette market! Strolling through this sensory market is such a sensory delight and you will find everything here from crafts, fresh flowers, produce, souveniers and more.\n\nTravel guide to Tahiti\n\nCheck out my travel guide for 24 hours in Tahiti for more.\n\nISLAND 2 : MOOREA\n\nIntro to Moorea\n\nMoorea is a geographical marvel with its 8 voluminous mountain peaks that rise from its translucent lagoon, creating a distinctive and rugged silhouette visible from the western coast of Tahiti. It has the most epic Jurassic Park like vibes everywhere! The island is blessed with dreamy lagoons, volcanic mountains, lush rainforests and more ; making it one of the most popular spots for a vacation or honeymoon in Tahiti!\n\nHow to get to Moorea ?\n\nTo get to Moorea, you can either fly or take a ferry. Taking a ferry is so much more convenient and cheaper! There are 2 main companies that have ferry services between Tahiti and Moorea – Aremiti ferries and Terevau ferries. Prices are roughly just around $11 per person per way and you can buy tickets the the ferry terminal directly. There are ferries that run pretty much every hour and it takes roughly 25-45 minutes one way, depending on whether you take the fast ferry or the slower one. I highly recommend renting a car to get around in Moorea – Avis Tahiti and Europcar are right off the ferry dock area.\n\nWhere to Stay in Moorea\n\nHere are few options in the budget category :\n\n1 ) Tipaniers Iti\n\nWe stayed at the charming little Tipaniers Iti right on Opunohu Bay. There are a few beach bungalows here and you can use all the facilities at Les Tipaniers hotel just about a 5 minute drive away.\n\n2 ) Les Tipaniers Hotel\n\nArguably the BEST beach in all of Moorea is Tipaniers beach and this hotel is located right on it! This was initially our first choice, but they were sold out for our dates so I would recommend booking in advance. There are many beach bungalows and villas to choose from here, 2 restaurants and a dive/kayak rental shop on the beach too.\n\nIf you are looking for the luxury overwater bungalow experience in Moorea – checkout Sofitel Moorea (below) or Hilton Moorea.\n\nThings to not miss in Moorea\n\nA lagoon tour in the beautiful lagoon where you get to swim with sharks and sting rays! We did this tour with Moorea Miti Tours and it was so much fun.\n\nBelvedere lookout – The iconic view of Moorea with Belvedere mountain, Cooks Bay and Opunohu Bay.\n\nSwimming with whales – if you visit during whale season (Aug – Oct) this bucketlist activity is a must do! Check out Corallina Tours or Moorea Moana Tours.\n\nTravel guide to Moorea\n\nCheckout my budget travel guide to Moorea for more.\n\nISLAND 3 : BORA BORA\n\nIntro to Bora Bora\n\nBora Bora was everything I had imagined and more! It completely exceeded my expectations in every way. This idyllic South Pacific gem is an epitome of a luxurious island escape and is well known for it gorgeous views of the mountains, crystal clear lagoon, luxury overwater villas and incredible marine life.\n\nHow to get to Bora Bora\n\nBora Bora is a short 45 minute flight from Tahiti. It is one of most scenic flights I have been on! It is open seating, so you want to get to the airport early to get in line to try to get the best seat in the house. Tip : Sit on the left side of the plane to get the best view!\n\nWhere to Stay in Bora Bora\n\nMy favorite resorts in Bora Bora in no particular order :\n\n1 ) FOUR SEASONS BORA BORA\n\nThe Four Seasons Bora Bora is a true gem located in perhaps the best location in Bora Bora. The resort is great for couples and families too. It is definitely on the pricier side – but 100% worth it for the five star luxury and hospitality! Exceptional service, luxe overwater villas and an overall incredible experience makes this one of my favorite places we have stayed ever. Check out my full BLOG POST HERE.\n\n2 ) INTERCONTINENTAL BORA BORA RESORT & THALASSO SPA\n\nIf you are looking for an amazing group of hotels to stay across both Tahiti and Bora, the Intercontinental French Polynesia group is your best bet. They have 1 resort in Tahiti and 2 in Bora Bora. The 2 resorts in Bora Bora are IC Thalasso ( more luxurious and located on its own motu) and IC Moana (on the mainland and slightly cheaper). We absolutely loved our stay at IC Thalasso especially cos of the beautiful views of Mount Otemanu, amazing overwater villas and the very friendly staff. IC Thalasso also is a fantastic option for families and couple alike. Check out my full BLOG POST HERE.\n\n3 ) CONRAD BORA BORA NUI RESORT\n\nThe newest luxury resort addition to Bora Bora is the Conrad Bora Bora Nui. Roomwise especially this was our fave, cos it was newer, more updated and had a super spacious deck with an overwater pool and hammock. While it dosen’t have a direct view of Mount Otemanu from the resort (only some villas do – like the King otemanu villa that we stayed at), it totally makes up for mountain views with the best private beach in all of Bora Bora – half a mile long with soft white sands! It also has the only 2 storey villa and hillside villas in Bora Bora too, if you are looking for something different. We saw a good range of travellers from solo travellers to families to honeymooners here. Check out my full BLOG POST HERE.\n\n4 ) LE BORA BORA BY PEARL RESORTS\n\nLe Bora Bora is a beautiful luxury resort in Bora Bora that has the best of both worlds – luxury and authentic Polynesian hospitality. It is the only Relais and Châteaux property in Bora Bora and sits on Motu Tevairoa, only a ten-minute boat ride from the airport and fifteen minutes across the lagoon from the village of Vaitape. Location wise Le Bora Bora is amazing – both because of its proximity to the airport and mainland, but also due to its magnificent views of Mount Otemanu. It sits in one of the most breathtaking areas of the lagoon where you see the stark contrast of the two shades of blue, personally my very favorite part of Bora Bora lagoon. Le Bora Bora felt like a luxurious escape in paradise but it still retained the laidback and authentic Polynesian vibes, which is the reason we keep going back to all the Pearl Resorts of Tahiti! Check out my full BLOG POST HERE.\n\n5 ) ST REGIS BORA BORA\n\nThe St. Regis Bora Bora Resort is a luxurious and picturesque resort located on its own private motu in Bora Bora. It is the only Forbes 5 star resort in Bora Bora and is renowned for its exceptional service, stunning natural beauty, featuring crystal-clear turquoise waters, lush tropical landscapes, and breathtaking views of Mount Otemanu. For more you can check out my blog post here.\n\n6) ROYAL BORA BORA (budget style option)\n\nAside from luxury hotels, Bora Bora also has many budget style hotels and airbnb’s on the main island. The only budget hotel we have stayed at is Royal Bora Bora and it was great – clean, basic and at an amazing location, close to Matira Beach. I honestly loved staying here for an extra 2-3 days after a stay at a luxury hotel so that I could also experience the main island of Bora Bora.\n\nThings to not miss in Bora Bora\n\n1) Lagoon tour in Bora Bora (group option) :\n\nThe number 1 thing to do in Bora Bora is a lagoon excursion on the world famous lagoon – meeting stingrays and sharks up close, snorkeling with the most colorful fish, cruising some unreal blue waters, learning about Polynesian culture and also enjoying a delicious island style lunch on a private motu. If all this sounds like a dream tour – you must check out Lagoon Service in Bora Bora. Check out more in my blog post here.\n\n2) Lagoon tour in Bora Bora (private option) :\n\nWhile a group lagoon tour is budget friendly, if you are looking for something more intimate and private I highly recommend doing a private lagoon tour. This way you can go to the spots you want to and experience the Bora Bora lagoon Robinson Crusoe style. We did this with Toa Boat Bora Bora and it was absolutely incredible. They have 3 pontoon style boats that are super comfy and many experiences to choose from. Read more in my blog post here.\n\n3) 4×4 tour in Bora Bora main island\n\nA 4×4 tour of Bora Bora is such a great way to explore the island. We did this ATV tour via Tinggly and it was so epic! We got to drive to the highest point in Bora Bora which you can drive to, to get an unforgettable 360 degree view of Bora Bora. You can use code SHANKAR20 to get 20% off any experience and getaway collections.\n\n4) Matira Beach\n\nFor the best beach in Bora Bora, don’t forget to visit world famous Matria beach, deemed as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It is quite possibly the most stunning public beach I have ever been to.\n\nTravel guide to Bora Bora\n\nFor more details check out my very detailed ultimate travel guide to Bora Bora.\n\nISLAND 4 : TETIAROA\n\nIntro to Tetiaroa\n\nWith its white sand beaches, swaying coconut palms, colorful birds, and sparkling lagoon, Tetiaroa is a dreamy paradise. Its truly one of the most gorgeous places I have ever been to in my life. Beyond its breathtaking beauty, Tetiaroa is a place of rare biodiversity and a natural sanctuary for birds and marine life. Tetiaroa also has a special place in Polynesian history and culture. It was the exclusive and favored retreat of Tahitian royalty for centuries. It is also home to one of the world’s best private island resorts – The Brando.\n\nHow to get to Tetiaroa\n\nPC : The Brando\n\nAfter arriving at Tahiti International Airport in Papeete you will have to take another short domestic flight. From Tahiti it’s a short but spectacular 20-minute flight to Tetiaroa onboard Air Tetiaroa, the flight from Bora Bora takes one hour. When you book a stay with the Brando their reservation agents will arrange this portion of your trip for you. This was hands down one of the most beautiful flights I have ever taken!\n\nWhere to Stay in Tetiaroa\n\nThe Brando is a unique luxury resort on French Polynesia’s breathtakingly beautiful private island of Tetiaroa – an atoll composed of a dozen small islands surrounding a sparkling lagoon 30 miles northeast of Tahiti.\n\nNamed after actor Marlon Brando who purchased the private island of Tetiaroa, after filming ‘Mutiny on the Bounty” he described the island as “a pinch of land peeking out of the immensity of the Pacific Ocean.” After Brando passed away, The Brando was built in 2014, as an eco-resort and spa which is now one of the most exclusive and luxurious private island resorts in the world. It is handsdown our no 1 favorite luxury resort in the world! Check out more in my BLOG POST HERE.\n\nThings to not miss in Tetiaroa\n\nTetiaroa is handsdown the MOST beautiful lagoon in all of French Polynesia! If you stay at The Brando I highly recommend the “Ultimate Lagoon Experience” which is their most popular excursion and an absolute must do on your visit. Along with 2 naturalist guides from Tetiaroa Society we set out to explore the beautiful Tetiaroa lagoon beyond Onetahi (the islet on which the resort sits). Our views while cruising down the unspoiled lagoon were just beyond breathtaking! We got to visit Bird Island, another island where we saw some unique flora and fauna (including rare bird species and coconut crabs!) and the iconic Queen’s Bath. As the name suggests – Tahitian royalty used to bathe here due to its mineral rich sands and pure waters! The water here is like a swimming pool – shallow, calm and warm.\n\nISLAND 5 : TAHA’A\n\nIntro to Taha’a\n\nTaha’a is blessed with lush mountains and valleys, turquoise lagoons and virgin motu islets! Its a lot less touristy than its popular neighbor Bora Bora. Personally I absolutely loved the rustic island charm and authentic Polynesian flair in Taha’a. Taha’a is also known as the “Vanilla Island.” Its fertile land and climate produce what chefs and gourmets around the world think is the tastiest, most fragrant vanilla on earth. Tahitian pearls are also produced in Taha’a. A few pearl farms take advantage of the island’s pure lagoon to grow endless variations of the famous pearl.\n\nHow to get to Taha’a\n\nTo get to Taha’a you will have to fly into Raiatea airport and take a boat shuttle over to Taha’a.\n\nWhere to Stay in Taha’a\n\nLe Taha’a Island Resort is a stunning luxury resort, set on beautiful Motu Tautau, a private islet looking onto the lush shores of Taha’a on one side and the majestic silhouette of Bora Bora on the other. It was the first member of Relais & Chateaux in the Islands of Tahiti and is a part of the Pearl Resorts which also have other beautiful resorts around in French Polynesia. Check out more in my BLOG POST HERE.\n\nThings to not miss in Taha’a\n\nAn island tour of Taha’a to check out its vanilla farms, a pearl farm as well as a local rum distillery.\n\nThe other popular tour is a lagoon tour of Taha’a which is what we opted to do! The highlight of this tour was getting to snorkel with black tip sharks and it was incredible. We have done this in a few other islands in Tahiti, but I must say it was the best in Taha’s as there aren’t too many people. Infact when Anush and I went we were the only ones in the water with the sharks, which was awesome!\n\nISLAND 6 : TIKEHAU\n\nIntro to Tikehau\n\nTikehau is one of the most beautiful atolls of the Tuamotu archipelago and is the coral-covered crown of an ancient, 65-million years submarine volcano. Its white and pink sand islets, fringed with coconut trees, shape a 177 square-mile lagoon that opens onto the ocean through a single pass, which is why it is one of the most marine rich atolls in the world!\n\nHow to get to Tikehau\n\nTo get to Tikehau you will have to fly into Tikehau airport and take a boat shuttle to your accommodation if necessary.\n\nWhere to Stay in Tikehau\n\nLe Tikehau by Pearl Resorts is an authentic Polynesian sanctuary, located in an unspoiled natural setting of a private coral islet called Motu Tiano. The location of Le Tikehau is absolutely unreal – remote, untouched and so picturesque! Its easily one of the most beautiful places we have ever been to. Pink sand beach, wild coconut groves, a beautiful tropical garden and the most gorgeous lagoon at the end of the world make this an idyllic escape like no other. Read more in my BLOG POST HERE.\n\nThings to not miss in Tikehau\n\nA lagoon tour in Tikehau is an absolute must do! Tikehau is truly spectacular – both above and below the water. If you are an avid diver, this is paradise for you! And even if you dont dive, I highly recommend doing a lagoon tour. The only way to really get a taste of everything this unique atoll has to offer is by venturing out into the lagoon.\n\nWe did a full day lagoon tour with Hititemanava Lagoon Excursions and it was absolutely incredible! From snorkeling with manta rays, to exploring Puarua (bird island of Tikehau), to eating a delicious local lunch in a fisherman’s village, to discovering more unspoiled motus – this is a must do activity in Tikehau.\n\nISLAND 7 : Rangiroa\n\nIntro to Rangiroa\n\nRangiroa is the second largest atoll in the world and the largest lagoon atoll in all of French Polynesia! Rangiroa is known to be one of the world’s most immense natural aquarium thanks to its large marine rich lagoon. Being very accessible yet secluded in every way, this island off the beaten track is both known from its renowned diving as well as exceptional lagoons.\n\nHow to get to Rangiroa\n\nAir Tahiti has a direct flight option to Rangiroa from Papeete as well as from Bora Bora! It was so convenient for us to get here from Bora Bora.\n\nWhere to Stay in Rangiroa\n\nWe stayed at the casual luxury Hotel Kia Ora resort and spa, which is arguably the best hotel in Rangiroa! It sits on the most beautiful lagoon and is nestled within a dreamy palm tree grove! We absolutely loved staying at this traditional hotel, it has all the amenities you would expect from a luxury hotel but still remains very rooted and authentic in tradition.\n\nThings to not miss in Rangiroa\n\nSince we aren’t divers I am not going to cover any diving in this. But the one activity I highly recommend to do Rangiroa is an excursion to Reef Island and Blue Lagoon. We did this with Orava Excursions and it such an incredible day exploring Rangiroa lagoon. Another spot to visit in the lagoon is Pink sands.\n\nTravel guide to Rangiroa\n\nFor more details check out my very detailed travel guide to Rangiroa.\n\nISLAND 8 : Fakarava\n\nIntro to Fakarava\n\nFakarava is one of the most beautiful lagoon atolls in French Polynesia and in the world! It has been deemed as a UNESCO Biosphere reserve due to its particularly rare flora and fauna. The rectangular reef encloses such a rich unique ecosystem and the protected coral atoll here is a natural reserve for many rare species of birds, plants and crustaceans. This is a diver’s haven and is the one place in the world known for its “wall of sharks” – where you can dive with over 500 sharks! Diving enthusiasts come from all over the world to swim with the majestic gray sharks in the waters of Fakarava, explore the coral reef and drop-off, and admire the sea turtles, rays, barracudas and a host of other marine species. We aren’t divers and even with just snorkeling you can see a ton of marine life! And if you are a sucker for idyllic lagoon and remote islands of the beaten path – Fakarava is truly the island of dreams!\n\nHow to get to Fakarava\n\nAir Tahiti has a direct flight option to Fakarava from Papeete as well as from Rangiroa. It was so convenient for us to get here from Rangiroa.\n\nWhere to Stay in Fakarava\n\nFakarava dosen’t have any major resorts or big accomodations. Infact I feel like the absence of any major resort is truly a blessing in disguise as it only helps to maintain the atoll’s pure surroundings, secluded appeal and authentic nature. Havaiki Lodge is the best place to stay in all of Fakarava. Located in north Fakarava, it sits on the most beautiful beach in town and has a couple of accomodation styles to choose from – beach bungalows, garden rooms, etc. We loved staying in a garden room, it had a clean basic bedroom, bathroom and balcony. They have two restaurants, a superb beachfront, the oldest pearl farm as well as operate their own tours in North Fakarava.\n\nThings to not miss in Fakarava\n\nSince we were only in the North for this trip and since we don’t dive, I will only cover the activities we did. We booked all of these with Havaiki.\n\n1 ) Green Lagoon Tour\n\nA must visit in Fakarava is Motu Teahatea or commonly known as Green Lagoon – an idyllic lagoon sheltered by palm fringed motus all around. It is like a natural swimming pool of crystal clear waters filled with fish, black tip sharks and so much healthy coral.\n\n2 ) PK-9 beach\n\nPk 9 beach is drop dead gorgeous and what you would imagine a wild Tuamotu beach would look like. As the name suggests it is 9km west of Rotoava (you would need to go past the airport and follow the dirt track on the left at the PK9 marker). It’s a thin, laid-back stretch of white coral sand backed by tall leaning palms and lapped by sparkling turquoise waters.\n\n3 ) Try the Pearl Lottery at Havaiki’s Pearl Farm\n\nPearl Farming is very popular in the Tuamotus and Havaiki has the oldest pearl farm in Fakarava! It has also been featured in several articles including National geographic. A must do activity in Fakarava is attending a presentation at the farm where they show you everything about how they harvest pearls, demonstrate grafting and so much more. You can also get to try your luck at the Pearl Lottery where you can pick an oyster and harvest your own pearl where it can be made into a simple bracelet or necklace. This was our absolute favorite souvenir, so special!\n\nTravel guide to Fakarava\n\nFor more details check out my very detailed travel guide to Fakarava.\n\nISLAND 9 : Nuku Hiva\n\nIntro to Nuku Hiva\n\nThe Marquesas Islands are a group of volcanic islands in French Polynesia and are known for their rugged, mountainous landscapes, rich history, and cultural significance. The Marquesas are somewhat remote compared to other tourist-frequented Polynesian islands such as Tahiti or Bora Bora, offering a unique and relatively untouched glimpse into Polynesian culture and natural beauty. They also have their own unique culture and language which is so fascinating! Nuku Hiva is the largest of the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia, known for its rugged terrain, archaeological sites, and rich history. The island offers dramatic landscapes, from towering mountains and lush valleys to ancient stone statues and petroglyphs.\n\nHow to get to Nuku Hiva\n\nAir Moana and Air Tahiti both have a direct 3 hour flight from Papeete to the Marquesas and flies to both Hiva Ova and Nuku Hiva.\n\nWhere to Stay in Nuku Hiva\n\nLe Nuku Hiva by Pearl Resorts is undoubtedly the best place to stay in all of Nuku Hiva. It is a Relais and Chateaux property as well. The resort is located cliffside facing the stunning Taiohae bay and at a convenient location perfect for exploring the island. The Lodge experience aims to be authentic, laid-back, in harmony with the Marquesan life philosophy.\n\nThings to not miss in Nuku Hiva\n\nFrom our 3 day stay in Nuku Hiva, here is a quick list of the must do things in Nuku Hiva :\n\n1) Taiohae\n\nTaiohae is a pretty, small seaside town. It is the administrative, economic and educational center of the Marquesas Islands, with French and Polynesian administrations, police, post office, hospital, city hall, Air Tahiti agency, bank, schools and a few shops. Must see sites include the Notre Dame Cathedral, Tohua Temehea and Tohua Koueva.\n\n2) Roadtrip around the island\n\nGo on a roadtrip around the island and take it all the beautiful views – Aakapa bay is my favorite viewpoint! If you do a full day island tour with the resort they will take you to all the best scenic spots.\n\n3) Hatiheu Bay\n\nMost of the islanders live in the three main villages : Taiohae, Taipivai and Hatiheu. The most iconic beach of Nuku Hiva is undoubtedly Hatiheu Bay a dark sand beach framed with the towering knife edge ridges of the mountains behind. It is truly so mystical and magical in every way, one can absolutely feel the mana in this ethereal place. The valley of Hatiheu is in the north-west of the island. It is a mystical place, with a troubled past, rich in archeological remains. It is one of the most important archeological sites in the Marquesas Islands, with paepae (stone platforms), tiki, me’ae (religious sites) and numerous petroglyphs etched into the rocks.\n\n4) Go Hiking or Horseback riding\n\nMany bays are only accessible by hiking, on a horseback ride or by boat ! Nuku Hiva has tons of hikes to explore its rugged raw terrain. Do not miss out on the Anaho bay hike or a horseback ride to Ha’atuatua bay.\n\n5) Eat a traditional Marquesan meal\n\nYvonnes at Hatiheu is incredible!\n\n6) Watch a traditional Marquesan cultural show\n\nLe Nuku Hiva has a monthly show and this was one of my favorite evenings !\n\nTravel guide to Nuku Hiva\n\nFor more details check out my very detailed travel guide to Nuku Hiva.\n\nQuick Links to other blog posts :\n\nAdding this here in case you want quick access to other French Polynesia travel guide posts.
