My answers are in blue, and Bob's are italicized .\n\nWhat\n\nwas something that you loved that you didn’t foresee and what was\n\nsomething you were worried about that you didn’t need to be?\n\nAlthough\n\nit was not technically on this section of the passage, I loved the\n\nDoldrums. Admittedly we had a motor and so we were not relying on the\n\nwind to get us through, but I loved the stillness of the ocean. The\n\nabsolute glassiness of it. The things that I worried about I am not sure\n\nthat I didn’t need to concerned about. We worried about them so that we\n\nwould do everything we could to stop them from happening.\n\nBetter\n\nthan I thought was how fast the time passed, with special thanks to\n\nreading. I worried that sleep loss could become a cumulative\n\nproblem, but that wasn't really the case.\n\nHow\n\nwas your experience extending a strange alternating sleep schedule over\n\nthe long time period? Did you ever fall asleep on watch?\n\nOur\n\nwatch schedule is a natural extension of our typical habits. Bob tends\n\nto fall asleep earlier than I do, and thus wake up earlier. We just push\n\nthis schedule to its limits and it works well. Bob falls asleep as\n\nearly as he can, sometimes as early as 7, then wakes up at 1 or 2 and\n\ntakes over from me. I like to stay up reading, so I just push that to\n\nstaying up later and later, then I get to sleep in the morning. There\n\nwere certainly days that our rhythms were interrupted by weather or\n\nequipment breakage, but then we just take turns napping during the day.\n\nMy\n\nexperiences on previous passages prepared me well mentally, however on\n\nthis passage the motion of the boat was a greater challenge to both\n\ngetting and staying asleep.\n\nWhat would you do differently if you did it again?\n\nI\n\nwould download more podcasts, they are great company on nightwatch. I\n\nthought I had done so, but most of them were gone by the time I wanted\n\nto listen to them.\n\nI agree with more podcasts, but if we could find the right person, another crew member would be worthwhile.\n\nWhat food that you provisioned did you wish you had more of and which food did you never actually eat?\n\nWe\n\nwould have liked to have more non dairy ice cream but the freezer just\n\ncouldn't hold any more. Also more lettuce would have been nice, but it\n\nis difficult to get it to last.\n\nI\n\nagree with the lettuce and ice cream, and would add more hummus. We did\n\nnot use many canned goods, but those are really provisioned for our\n\nremaining months before large groceries in Papeete.\n\nDid\n\nyou think about people who had made this crossing before access to\n\ntechnologies you have? Anyone in particular? Did you feel connected to\n\npast explorers and sailors in some way out in the vast open blue?\n\nThank\n\ngoodness for technology! To do this without GPS, our chartplotter and\n\nour Sat phone would have been a totally different experience, and\n\nnot something that I believe it would have enjoyed. I did think about\n\nthose who came before us and how their experiences differed from ours.\n\nCertainly\n\none cannot discount the advantages of GPS and the security that\n\nknowledge feeds you every day you are out of sight of land. When I think\n\nof the Polynesians, that for thousands of years, explored these same\n\nwaters by reading the waves, the wind, and determining their location by\n\nholding their hand up to the stars, I am humbled.\n\nAll\n\nwho have gone to sea before us, and all our fellow cruisers today\n\nreadily share information. Technology and information properly applied\n\nkeeps us safe, and allows us to continue following in the path of the\n\nreal explorers.\n\nAt what point in your crossing did you feel most isolated?\n\nFor\n\na while our text messaging app was not working. When I wasn't\n\ngetting any messages from the outside world I definitely felt isolated.\n\nWhen\n\nthe autopilot had troubles twice in one day, along with battery\n\ncharging issues, I felt we could be out there days longer with constant\n\nhandsteering and maybe a loss of refrigeration. But isolation is\n\nrelative when you know you just have to fix things the best you can and\n\nkeep going.\n\nWhat was the most: Fun? Rewarding? Emotionally moving? Boring? Challenging? Unexpected?\n\nWow,\n\nthat's a lot! Boring is easy - the lack of being able to do many things\n\nI love to do, go for a walk, make art, make music. There was just too\n\nmuch motion of the boat to feel comfortable enough to do the last two.\n\nUnexpected\n\nwould be the number of small (4-5 inches) squid that would be found on\n\ndeck in the morning at the beginning of the passage. At night I could\n\nshine a bright light into the water and see the light reflecting in the\n\nred eyes of the squid. They disappeared about halfway through the\n\npassage, but on our list of things yet to do is to clean up the squid\n\nink on deck.\n\nMost\n\nfun was ten minutes with dolphins swimming along in our bow wake. Most\n\nrewarding was finally getting to prove we could do it. Getting the\n\nbattery charger and autopilot to work again, thus avoiding minor\n\ncalamities was a real emotional lift. Most boring was the first third of\n\na book by William F. Buckley I gave up on. Most challenging was\n\nremaining able bodied and more or less upright for 20 days straight on a\n\nbroken carnival ride. Unexpected, was how quickly the time passed.\n\nWere there times when you were nervous or scared?\n\nWe\n\nhave made enough smaller passages that I wasn't really nervous or\n\nscared, but as is often the case, the most nerve-wracking is usually at\n\nthe end. In this case in the last 24 hours we had winds up to 25 knots\n\nand 3 meter seas. We have had continuing issues with our bio growth in\n\nour fuel and clogging the filters. We (and by we, I mean Bob) changed\n\nthe filters for safety reasons for the last hour before entering the\n\nharbor at Nuku Hiva. The winds we gusting up to 22 knots and the waves\n\nwere 3 meters and coming at us from the side. We were motoring at this\n\npoint to get into the harbor. At the mouth of the harbor are two very\n\nlarge rocks they call sentinels that we had to pass between. We were\n\nmaking plans as to what to do if the engine failed at that point (pull\n\nout the sails and turn back out to sea). For me this was definitely the\n\nhairiest part of the passage. All ended well, the engine didn't die, we\n\nmade it past the sentinels, into the harbor and safely set anchor.\n\nSometimes the way Sarah looks at me when she's handing me the hammer is pretty scary.\n\nFavorite constellations as viewed mid-ocean?\n\nTransit of Venus and Jupiter every morning just before first light.\n\nI\n\nloved watching the Milky Way and seeing the Southern Cross, but I have\n\nto admit that for all the hype that the Southern Cross gets, it is\n\npretty small in comparison to Northern Hemisphere constellations like\n\nthe Big Dipper or Orion. I think that the Souuthern Cross must have a\n\npretty good agent promoting it.\n\nHow did the food provisioning work out?\n\nOur freezer is not big enough for everything that we would like to bring, otherwise excellent.\n\nOur\n\nchocolate stash of artesian chocolate from Chocolopagos lasted until\n\nthe very last days, then we knew it was time for landfall. We still had\n\nsome carrots, cabbage and potatoes left at the end, we did not have to\n\nresort to a totally canned meal.\n\nHow do you navigate? Do you shoot the sun just for fun?\n\nWe\n\nhave no sextant aboard. We rely on satellite GPS, either through our\n\nchartplotter or our handheld radios. GPS is worldwide accurate. Besides,\n\ntoo many billion cell phone users, militaries, and Uber drivers need it\n\nfor it to fail. If by the strangest twist of fate GPS failed we would\n\nfall back to our compass, paper charts, the position of stars and\n\nplanets if visible, and dead reckoning. You adapt.\n\nWe\n\nplot a course on the chartplotter before we depart and then over the\n\nlength of this long passage we attempted to stay on course, often\n\ncorrecting for the wind and the currents which seemed to want to take us\n\nfurther south than we wanted to go.\n\nWhat is the deepest part of the Pacific that you have crossed?\n\nI think about 19,000 ft.\n\nWhen\n\nwe are sailing over the top we can't really tell if the water is\n\nseveral hundred feet deep or several thousand, it all looks the\n\nsame. And once the numbers go over several hundred feet our depth\n\nmonitor just says: depth - - -\n\nWhich buoyancy devices we use:\n\nWhen\n\nwe arrived in the Tuamotus we started off with fenders as we did not\n\ncarry anything else. The disadvantage of fenders is that they compress\n\nif they submerse, one gets growth on them, etc. Those hard plastique\n\npearl farm buoys are much better. Some people say, they are washed\n\nashore everywhere in the Tuamotus. Well that was not our experience.\n\nKauehi was our first atoll and in any reasonable distance from the\n\nvillage the shore line was cleaned by the locals. Nevertheless, many\n\nvillagers have their stash of pearl farm buoys in their gardens. So we\n\nsimply walked to one obviously very friendly fellow and asked whether we\n\ncould have four of them. He actually picked the four nicest he had, of\n\nthe same color, including lines attached to them and did not even want\n\nto have anything in return. We put on clips/little carabines to the ends\n\nof the lines for fast attachment / detachment to/from the anchor chain\n\nand were ready to go.\n\nWhat kind of clips we use:\n\nWe\n\nuse little stainless steel carabiners, the size is basically driven by\n\nthe diameter to fit through a chain link, i.e. it needs to be\n\nsufficiently thin (we have a 10mm DIN chain, so carabiners end up being\n\nlike 4-5cm in length), we use different sorts, i.e. whatever we found in\n\nour related spare part bag\n\nWhere we position the buoys:\n\nOur\n\napproach is to put the first buoy typically / normal conditions at 10m\n\nplus water depth from the anchor, then a buoy every 5m of chain, after\n\nthe fourth we let out another 7-8m of chain and then hook the bridle.\n\nThere are other recommendations which take a multiplier to water depth\n\n(like 1.5x or 2x water depth), but we just find that not suitable to\n\naccommodate for all ranges of water depths. The 10m basically decides\n\nhow much chain ends up on the seabed, one could do less if the sandy\n\npatch is really small or more if there is a larger sandy patch to anchor\n\n(in case one sees that at all).\n\nWith\n\nthis approach we end up with a few meters more chain out than based on\n\nour non-floating chain length rule under normal conditions (we apply\n\nwaterdepth plus 30m) – in bad conditions we obviously deploy more in\n\nboth cases (non-floating and floating).\n\nHow we deploy the buoys:\n\nFirst\n\nwe explore to find the spot we want to anchor as usual. If possible we\n\nwould look for a sandy patch for the anchor itself, but despite the\n\nclear water, when anchoring in deeper water we are not able to see for\n\ngood and/or be able to drop the anchor that accurately. We put out as\n\nmuch chain as we feel comfortable to “drive in” the anchor. Then we pull\n\nup the chain again to the first spot for the first buoy (the 10m +\n\nwater depth), then put out 5m chain, attach a buoy, etc. (lifting the\n\nanchor is as usual, just stopping at every buoy and unclipping it, it\n\ndoes not really delay the process once one gets the hang of it).\n\nHow we clip on the clips:\n\nFor\n\nus it is exactly the same as putting the chain hook / bridle on. So in\n\nour case we have to bend over the pull pit and downward to clip them on,\n\nbut as said, that’s the same as we do with the bridle as well and\n\n“normal procedure” for us. If we had a set-up where the chain hook would\n\ncome through the bow roller, the clips could go through as well as they\n\nare way smaller than our chain hook and in our case it would be easy to\n\nget a clip and line from the front through the bowroller back on deck.\n\nDifficulties I could only see arising if it was – due to bow design /\n\nset-up – tricky to get to the chain outside of the bow or the clip from\n\nthe front through the bowroller back on deck or into the chain locker,\n\nbut that’s set-up specific, hard to comment in general (in the worst\n\ncase I would deploy by dinghy).\n\nGeneral experience:\n\nIn\n\ngeneral, the boat swings easier than with a non-floating chain, due to\n\nthe missing friction of the chain length towards the yacht. In places\n\nwhere the wind is dominant anyways and is stable trade wind from the\n\nsame sector all the time, that’s no issue at all. In places, where\n\nswinging is dominated rather by current or tide, one obviously has to\n\ncheck for the space.\n\nIn\n\nour case only the buoy closest to the yacht is floating on water level\n\nin a low wind situation, the others are submersed. We actually measured\n\nin one instance the depths of the clips on the anchor chain on an\n\nanchorage where the anchor was at 11.5m depths: the clips of the buoys\n\nwere at 7m, 4m, 2m and 0m water depth respectively (starting from the\n\nanchor) at low wind."
