Beck in 1921.:\n\n“January 24\n\nI went up onto the plateau and on up to Mt. Ootua several miles to the eastward, and around its base saw several red-capped doves of which three were secured. they were as reported, found near the heads of canyons and usually seen when flying to or from the canyon where the stream of water was flowing. As I stood on the top of the ridge with a brisk breeze sweeping over, one flew back and forth to windward of me several times looking at me. Their call notes did not seem to have the half douen rapid “Coos” at the end of the cooing as does the white-crowned and the Tahitian species. … The red-crown would come to my calling occasionally, but in the thick forest would fly past or light unseen. No white-crowns were seen where the reds were found, but they occurred just below them.” [1]\n\nThe white-capped Fruit-Dove (Ptilnopus dupetithouarsii (Neboux) is still found on most of the Marquesan Islands, it is thus somewhat strange that the Rad-capped Fruit-Dove is now extinct.

Shape and sculpture fall within the limits of variation observed for the nominate race. The diameter (3.52 mm.) is less than that of nearly all adult A. radiella radiella, but the shell is clearly subadult and this difference has no significance.” [1]\n\n***\n\nsyn.

Tavaetu on the island of Tubuai, Austral Islands.\n\nThe author gives a description of the life animal.:\n\n“Animal similar to M. ornatella but with row of black dots between pedal grooves, similar squarish ones above this and vaguer, smaller ones below; mantle-lobes and shell-laps edged with dark spots.” [1]\n\n***\n\nThe species could not be found during recent searches and is considered most likely extinct.
