        "text": "Buy data Donate\n\nUpdates:\n\nSorin Cosoveanu sent me a link to source [4], which has (as it turns out) preliminary 2012 census data, and then source [9], which has the final results. I replaced the former with the latter in the table below.\n\nClipperton Island has been placed directly under the administration of the French Overseas Ministry. Technically, it is now a public domain of the French state (domaine public de l'État français, propriété domaniale de lEtat). As such, it is part of France, but not part of any other subdivision of France. Since it has no permanent inhabitants, I have exercised my editorial prerogatives by listing it here, and not as part of France itself.\n\nParaskevas Renesis writes that the status of French Polynesia was changed from territoire d'outre-mer (overseas territory) to pays d'outre-mer (overseas country) by Law 2004-192 of 2004-02-27, signed by the president on 2004-03-01. Source [3] gives the date 2003-12-18. At source [2], the U.M.P. Party specifies the more precise title \"pays d'outre-mer au sein de la République\" (overseas country in the bosom of the Republic), and says that the assembly passed the measure on 2004-01-15. The French Yahoo! News says that Parliament passed the measure on 2004-01-29. I suppose that each of the dates represents a different stage in the process, and that the effective date is the latest one, 2004-03-01. The effect of this change is to give French Polynesia an additional degree of autonomy.\n\nSources disagree about the capital of Tuamotu and Gambier Islands. The book \"Administrative Subdivisions of Countries\" said that the capital was Rangiroa, on Rangiroa Island, in the Tuamotu group. Many sources say that it's Rikitea, on Mangareva Island, although some of them refer to Rikitea as the capital of only the Gambier Islands. The most official source I could find was INSEE (source [5]), which says that the provisional administrative seat of Tuamotu and Gambier Islands is Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia.\n\nThe primary divisions of French Polynesia used to be known as circonscriptions. In recent documents, they are called subdivisions administratives. It may be that the new status was created by a change in the basic law which took place on 1999-03-19. On the same occasion, the status of the secondary divisions was supposedly changed from communes to circonscriptions territoriales.\n\nThe results of the census of French Polynesia, taken on 1996-09-03, have been published. They are shown in the table below.\n\nErrata: In the main table for French Polynesia on page 136, two digits were transposed in the population of Marquesas Islands. The correct figure should be 7,358. This makes the total 1988 population of French Polynesia come to 188,814. (My source also had the digits transposed.)\n\nThe postal codes for French Polynesia have the form F-987xx, an extension of the French system. (The book contained a typo in the code.)\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameFRENCH POLYNESIA ISO codePF FIPS codeFP LanguagesFrench (fr), Tahitian Time zone-10 (see note) CapitalPapeete\n\nFormed in 1903 under the name French Establishments in Oceania (Établissements français de l'Océanie), by uniting several French colonies. In 1946, its status changed to overseas territory. In 1957, it was renamed French Polynesia.\n\nTime zone note: the Marquesas Islands are in the -9:30 time zone; the Gambier Islands, -9. However, the majority of the Tuamotu and Gambier Islands subdivision is in the -10 time zone.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDutch: Frans Polynesië\n\nEnglish: Territory of French Polynesia (formal)\n\nFrench: Polynésie f française, Établissements mp français de l'Océanie (obsolete)\n\nGerman: Französisch-Polynesien n\n\nIcelandic: Franska Pólýnesía\n\nItalian: Polinesia Francese\n\nNorwegian: Fransk Polynesia\n\nPortuguese: Polinésia Francesa\n\nRussian: Французская Полинезия\n\nSpanish: Polinesia f Francesa\n\nTurkish: Fransız Polinezyası\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nDescriptive: French possessions in Polynesia. Polynesia comes from the Greek words for \"many islands\".\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nFrench Polynesia is divided into five subdivisions administratives (administrative subdivisions) and Clipperton Island.\n\nNameHASCPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Capital Clipperton IslandPF.CI052none Leeward IslandsPF.LI34,581430166Uturoa, Raiatea Marquesas IslandsPF.MI9,261997385Taiohae, Nuku Hiva Tuamotu and Gambier IslandsPF.TG16,831877339Papeete, Tahiti Tubuai IslandsPF.TI6,82014255Mataura, Tubuai Windward IslandsPF.WI200,7141,196462Papeete, Tahiti 6 subdivisions268,2073,6471,408\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nPopulation: 2012-08-22 census.\n\nCapital: city name, island.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Communes of French Polynesia page.\n\nFrench Polynesia is subdivided into 48 communes.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nA note in ISO standard 3166 states that Clipperton Island is part of France. Prior to 2007, the ISO standard said that it was part of French Polynesia. FIPS PUB 10-4 lists Clipperton Island as a separate country (code IP). The GENC standard also lists it as a country, with codes CP and CPT. ISO 3166-2 now lists it as part of France, with the code FR-CP. Clipperton is over 3,000 km. from the nearest part of French Polynesia, and over 11,000 km. from European France.\n\nLeeward Islands extends from Bellinghausen Island and the Îles Scilly in the west to Raiatea and Huahine in the east. It also includes Bora Bora.\n\nMarquesas Islands extends from Eiao and Hatutu in the northwest to Fatu Hiva in the southeast. It also includes Hiva Oa.\n\nTuamotu and Gambier Islands includes several smaller island groups: the Actaeon Islands, Disappointment Islands, Duke of Gloucester Islands, Gambier Islands, and King George Islands. Some of its outlying members are Hereheretue, Timoe (Temoe), Pukapuka, and Matahiva.\n\nTubuai Islands extends from Îles Maria in the west to Îles Marotiri (Îlots de Bass) in the east. It also includes Tubuai and Rurutu.\n\nWindward Islands extends from Maiao (Tubuai Manu) in the west to Mehetia in the east. It also includes Tahiti and Moorea.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for French Polynesia lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nClipperton Island: discovered by pirate Clipperton in 1705.\n\nLeeward Islands, Windward Islands: named for their relative locations in the Society Islands with respect to the prevailing easterly winds. The Society Islands, in turn, were named by Captain James Cook in honor of the Royal Society of Sciences, which had subsidized his journey.\n\nMarquesas Islands: named by Alvaro de Mendana de Neyra in honor of his uncle, Marquis Antonio de Mendoza, viceroy of Peru.\n\nTuamotu and Gambier Islands: Tahitian tua: high sea, motu: islands; Gambier Islands named for James Gambier of the British Admiralty by their discoverer, Captain Wilson.\n\nChange history:\n\n1931: Clipperton Island, disputed between France and Mexico, awarded to France by arbitration.\n\n1936-06-12: Clipperton Island attached to French Establishments in Oceania.\n\n1946-10-25: Status of Établissements français de l'Océanie changed to overseas territory.\n\n1957-07-22: Name of territory changed to Polynésie française.\n\n2004-03-01: Status of French Polynesia changed from overseas territory to overseas country.\n\n2007-02-21: Clipperton Island placed directly under the administration of the French Overseas Ministry (Ministère de l'Outre-Mer).\n\nOther names of subdivisions:\n\nClipperton Island: Île Clipperton (French)\n\nLeeward Islands: Îles sous le Vent (French)\n\nMarquesas Islands: Îles Marquises (French); Isole Marchesi (Italian); Markesasinseln, Marquesasinseln (German); Marquezas Islands (obsolete)\n\nTuamotu and Gambier Islands: Îles Tuamotu et Gambier (French); Low Archipelago (obsolete); Paumotu Islands (obsolete)\n\nTubuai Islands: Austral Islands (variant); Îles Australes, Îles Tubuai (French)\n\nWindward Islands: Îles du Vent (French)\n\nPopulation history:\n\nName1962-11-091971-02-081977-04-291983-10-151996-09-032007-08-202012-08-22 Leeward Islands16,00015,71816,31119,06026,83833,94934,581 Marquesas Islands5,0005,5935,4196,5488,0649,2819,261 Tuamotu and Gambier Islands7,0008,2269,05211,79315,37018,31716,831 Tubuai Islands4,0005,0795,2086,2836,5636,6696,820 Windward Islands52,00084,552101,392123,069162,686196,520200,714 Total85,000119,168137,382166,753219,521264,736268,207\n\nSources:"
