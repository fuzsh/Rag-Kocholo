From the sparkling white sands by the beautiful turquoise green lagoon water to the overwhelming sound of the breaking waves by the Pacific shores, this nation is a natureâ€™s paradise in true sense. French Polynesia might be a little known destination but it excels as a perfect tropical getaway and the most romantic honeymoon vacation. Relax by an atoll or offshore coral islets, take a stroll within the high-rise palm trees and lush jungles, enjoy a coconut drink at the busy night bazaars; opportunities for rejuvenation are galore in this island nation. The soaring silhouette of Morea islands, the atolls of Bora Bora and the warm smiles of friendly Tahitians mark the characteristics of French Polynesia. Tourists to this amazing destination should not miss out the opportunities of scuba diving and snorkelling where you rub shoulders with shoals of colourful sea fish. People with strong heart can also brave the shark dives to view this astounding sea creature from a yards distance.\n\nPalm trees on Moorea\n\nFrench Polynesia is a group of about 118 islands located on the eastern part of the South Pacific Ocean. Geographically they are located halfway between California of United States of America and Australia. The islands of French Polynesia are part of the Polynesian archipelago.

French Polynesia consists of several groups of islands, which includes Austral Islands, Bass Islands, Gambier Islands, Marquesas Islands, Society Islands and Tuamotu Archipelago. Apart from these main landforms other small islets and atolls include Bora Bora, Hiva `Oa, Huahine, Maiao, Maupiti, Mehetia, Moorea, Nuku Hiva, Raiatea, Tahaa, Tetiaroa, Tubuai, and Tupai. Tahiti Island is part of the Society Island group and is the most largest and populated of them all.
