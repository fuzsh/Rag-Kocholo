Yorkton, a city of nearly 17,000, serves as the main shopping and service center for much of east-central Saskatchewan and western Manitoba.

Yorkton's trading area extends several hundred kilometers in all directions, encompassing a population of about 200,000.

As the main trading and service center for the area, Yorkton has attracted most major retailers, restaurants, farm implement dealers, and car dealers, as well as a vast number of locally-owned businesses catering to the requirements of a rural and farm population.

Farms in the region are somewhat smaller and much more diversified than in other areas of the province, providing for a more prosperous and more stable farm economy.

About Saskatchewan

Saskatchewan is located in the heartland of Canada, bordered by the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Alberta, and to the south by the American states North Dakota and Montana.

The name is derived from the Plains Indian word "kisiskatchewan", meaning the river that flows swiftly.

Saskatchewan covers more than 650,000 square kilometers (over a quarter million square miles), of which half is forest, a third is farmland, and an eighth is fresh water. The farmland produces more than 54 per cent of the wheat grown in Canada, making agriculture (along with mining, manufacturing and tourism) a principal export industry.

Saskatchewan is home to a million people, many with their family roots in eastern Europe, Russia, Scandinavia and the British Isles.
