        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe hydrology of the Canadian Prairies has been described as a semi-arid, cold regions system where snowmelt runoff over frozen soils dominates streamflow generation, substantial runoff is stored in depressions restricting basin contributing areas and summer rainfall primarily supplies crop evapotranspiration (Gray, 1970; Gray et al., 1986; Granger and Gray, 1989; Pomeroy et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2010). But since early assessments, the region has undergone changes in climate (Akinremi et al., 1999; Millet et al., 2009; Bonsal et al., 2012; Shook and Pomeroy, 2012) and land use (e.g. Rashford et al., 2011) – both impact streamflow generating processes (e.g. Burn et al., 2010). The Canadian Prairies are part of North America's Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), which typically receives less than 500 mm per year of precipitation (Burn et al., 2008). Although snowfall accounts for only one-third of the total precipitation, over 80% of the streamflow is derived from snowmelt over frozen soils (Gray and Landine, 1988). The millions of isolated depressions in the PPR capture most of the runoff generated owing to their unusually high storage capacity (Hayashi et al., 2003) but can connect to each other or streams during times of high runoff through the fill and spill process (Spence, 2007; van der Kamp and Hayashi, 2009). Connectivity among depressions changes with depressional storage, producing intermittent streamflow (Spence, 2007) and resulting in dynamic contributing area for runoff to streams (Shaw et al., 2012). The relationship between contributing area and storage is hysteretic with a sharp decrease in contributing area as depressional storage evaporates or percolates into the subsurface (Shook et al., 2013). Spring streamflow is controlled by the hydrological processes that transform snowfall into streamflow, including blowing snow redistribution, sublimation, snowmelt, infiltration into frozen soils and runoff over a variable contributing area connected to the stream channel via the fill and spill dynamics of depressional storage (Shook et al., 2015).\n\nConsiderable research indicates that prairie hydrology is highly sensitive to changes in climate and land use given its domination by cold regions hydrological processes and high evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio (Conly and van der Kamp, 2001; Fang and Pomeroy, 2007). In general, precipitation has increased (Millet et al., 2009) primarily due to an increase in rainfall (Vincent et al., 2007; Mekis and Vincent, 2011). The persistence of rainfall events has also changed. From 1951 to 2000, the number of multi-day storms increased at many sites in the Canadian Prairies while the number of single-day events decreased (Shook and Pomeroy, 2012). Future climate projections presented in Töyrä et al. (2005) using 11 global climate models over the Canadian Prairies were highly variable, yet the median of the results suggests increased temperature and precipitation by 2050 and 2080 when compared with that of 1961–1990 climatology. Annual temperatures are projected to increase 2.0 and 3.8 °C with increases in annual precipitation of 9.5% and 14.2% by 2050 and 2080, respectively.\n\nEradication of the plains bison and cessation of aboriginal grassland management by fire by the 1870s created substantial but poorly documented changes to the landscape. Since European settlement in the early 1900s, native grasslands and wetlands (Heagle et al., 2013) have been converted to cropland or pastureland (Hanuta, 2001; Upper Assiniboine River Basin Study, 2000). Although studies have shown that the conversion of grassland to cropland on the upland slopes of the wetlands increases the amount of runoff that enters the wetland (van der Kamp et al., 2003; Voldseth et al., 2007), the impact of such changes on streamflow under 100% conversion to cropland at a basin scale using a modelling approach was found to decrease streamflow by 2% due to a loss of winter snowfall accumulation caused by increased blowing snow sublimation (Pomeroy et al., 2010). Water levels in wetlands are also vulnerable to changes in climate (Johnson et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2010; Werner et al., 2013) and other agricultural practices, such as tillage practices (eg. Elliott et al. 2001). About 70% of Canadian Prairie wetlands have been filled or drained since settlement (DUC, 2008). Because of recent intensification of agriculture (Rashford et al., 2011), efforts have been renewed to drain wetlands (Watmough and Schmoll, 2007) using drainage channels, which form permanent surface water connections between isolated wetlands, ditches or streams (Brunet and Westbrook, 2012). The reduced ability for depressions to store surface water permanently increases the contributing area and the volume of runoff (Brannen et al., in press; Upper Assiniboine River Basin Study, 2000).\n\nAttention has also been focused on linking changes in land use and climate to watershed hydrological response. In terms of land use, better understanding the impacts of wetland drainage on streamflows has been of recent interest. Modelling research has shown wetland drainage increases annual and peak daily flows as well as the magnitude and frequency of flooding (Gleason et al., 2007; Pomeroy et al., 2010, 2014; Yang et al., 2010). The few observational studies across the PPR that have examined meteorological, land use and streamflow data have mixed conclusions. For example, Miller and Nudds (1996) examined 12 unregulated rivers from Canada and the USA and found that landscape alteration, not changes in precipitation, caused an increase in runoff. In contrast, Ehsanzadeh et al. (2012a, 2014) could not find a detectable impact of climate change, wetland drainage or farming practices on streamflow frequency distributions in the Canadian Prairies from a range of rivers that included regulated systems. Similarly, Ehsanzadeh et al. (2014) concluded that wetland drainage has not had a detectable effect on streamflows across the Canadian Prairies, with the exception of one site, Smith Creek, Saskatchewan. In this study, a mixture of regulated and unregulated basins was used for the analysis, which may have had an effect on the results.\n\nThe baseline hydrology is well documented in this region, but it has recently undergone rapid changes in climate and land use. Recent studies have examined changes in climate and streamflow separately, or integrated them for statistical analysis at the basin scale with mixed results. There is a need for detailed and comprehensive analysis of changing hydrometeorology, drainage and runoff processes in order to better understand the dimensions of hydrological change in the region. There exist very few basins with datasets where this can be accomplished, which precludes a detailed regional approach. The objective of this paper is thus to describe the historical variability of detailed hydrometeorological, runoff process and wetland drainage variables for what is possibly the best-documented wetland-dominated headwater basin in the Canadian Prairies, Smith Creek Research Basin. The data will be assessed for trends and change points and will be used to identify associations between changes in wetland drainage and climate to the changes in the hydrological regime.\n\nStudy Site and Methods\n\nStudy site\n\nSmith Creek Research Basin (SCRB) is located within the Assiniboine River Basin and is approximately 60 km southeast of the city of Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada (Figure 1). SCRB has a gross drainage area of 393 km2 and is relatively flat with slopes of 2–5% and elevations of 490–548 m a.s.l. The dominant land use is agriculture (primarily cereals and canola) and the remainder is comprised of native grassland, deciduous woodland and natural wetlands (Fang et al., 2010). The dominant soil texture is loam (Saskatchewan Soil Survey, 1991). The basin lies within the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) where large portions of drainage basins do not normally contribute runoff to streamflow. The 1 : 2 year flow non-contributing area has been estimated by Agriculture and Agrifood Canada and is mapped along with the prairie agricultural zone and SCRB in Figure 1. The non-contributing area calculation is based on data from before the 1980s, and since then, depressions in the basin have been extensively drained. Flows in some depressions drains in SCRB are managed by the rural municipalities (RM) of Churchbridge and Langenburg through the use of culvert gates that are normally left open but are closed during periods of high spring runoff, resulting in the temporary restoration of the drained ponds in recent years. Hydrometeorological instrumentation at SCRB includes a streamflow gauge at the outlet operated by Water Survey of Canada, as well as two meteorological stations nearby each other in the southern part of the basin: one run by the University of Saskatchewan (U of S MET) and the other run by Environment Canada (station name: Langenburg, climate ID: 4014145).\n\nSimilar to the rest of the Canadian Prairies, peak discharge within SCRB has been typically caused by spring snowmelt that peaks in mid-April and ceases in May (see Figure 2 for example). Intense rainfall events have caused intermittent streamflow throughout the summer, but these events tended to be rare, small in volume and of short duration. From 2010 to 2014, streamflow within SCRB exhibited characteristics that are unlike the prairie hydrology that has been previously described (e.g. Gray, 1970). Mixed snowmelt and rainfall runoff in the spring of 2011 caused massive flooding, while high flows in 2012 and flooding in 2014 (including the all-time peak streamflow in 2014) were caused solely by rainfall, something that has never been recorded at the basin before 2012.\n\nMethods\n\nLand use change\n\nPonded area and drainage channel length were manually measured from early summer aerial photographs obtained from 1958, 2000 and 2009 by Lyle Boychuck of Ducks Unlimited Canada as part of their wetland monitoring programme (Boychuk et al., 2014). Ponds in the original analysis were divided into those with vegetation and those with open water, but for hydrological purposes, all shallow/open water and marshes were grouped together as ponds. Surface drainage channels are constructed to facilitate the flow of water from fields to the Smith Creek channel by enhancing natural spillways, create outlets for isolated depressions, or improving roadside ditches to handle increased flow from upstream drainage. Drainage channel features appear straight with uniform channel bottoms, and show evidence of excavation such as exposed clay or soil piles (Boychuk et al., 2014).\n\nHistorical agricultural land use data were obtained from the Census of Agriculture conducted by Statistics Canada (1961 to 2011) every 5 years through a nationwide survey. Information for the RMs of Langenburg (No. 181) and Churchbridge (No. 211) were used to document changes in land use for the RMs adjoining and including the SCRB, and involved changes in crop land, summer fallow, pasture land, woodland and wetlands (unimproved land), and tillage practices (only available since 1991).\n\nPrecipitation and snowcover\n\nDaily precipitation data (rainfall and snowfall) were compiled for the period between 1 November 1941 and 31 October 2014 following a hydrological year of November to October. Because of the short-term records from the U of S MET (2007–2013) and the missing data from the Langenburg Station (1960 to present), data from Yorkton, Saskatchewan (Environment Canada station ID: 4019080; 1942 to present), 60 km to the northwest, was used to both extend the records back to 1942 and infill missing data. Yorkton and Langenburg precipitation data were adjusted to the U of S MET based on the double mass curve method (Searcy and Hardison, 1960). Adjusted Langenburg data were used to infill missing U of S MET data, as well as backfill to 1960. Missing Langenburg data was replaced with adjusted Yorkton data, which were also used to backfill to 1942. Rainfall and snowfall data were adjusted separately as the relationship between sites changed with precipitation phase. Precipitation records from the Adjusted Homogenized Canadian Climate Database (AHCCD) were not used for this study due to limitations discovered at the nearest site, Tonkin, Saskatchewan. Data for AHCCD Tonkin site were compiled from two different stations with no corrections applied to account for site differences and were therefore deemed to be unsuitable for this study.\n\nDaily rainfall in the SCRB from May to September was separated into single-day and multiple-day rainfall events. Single-day rainfall events are defined as daily rainfall values that are preceded and followed by days with zero rainfall. Single-day rainfalls are characteristically caused by convective storms that can be intense with great local depth but cover small areas and are hydrologically ineffective because the volume of rainfall at a basin scale is small. Multiple-day rainfall events have two or more consecutive days of rainfall. These are typically due to frontal storms, which may have embedded convection but that are generally of lower intensity and much large area than single-day storms. Because of their duration and areal extent, multiple-day storms can cause saturation overland flow and streamflow at a basin scale (Shook and Pomeroy, 2012). To consider the changes in convective storms during the period in which they normally occur, the time period of May to September was used.\n\nSnow on ground data were obtained from the Environment Canada Yorkton station from 1956 to 2012 (missing 2007) and were used to identify the maximum snow depth, duration of continuous snowcover days and first snow-free date on an annual basis. The maximum snow depth was identified as being the greatest depth of snow, even if it was only for a single day. The duration of continuous snowcover is defined as the longest length of time within one snow season where snow depth is ≥1 cm. Trace amounts of snow on the ground were assumed to be 0 cm of depth and were not classified as a continuous snowcover. The first snow-free date is the first day when snow depth is 0 cm (the day after the continuous snowcover is depleted).\n\nTemperature\n\nTemperature data were obtained from AHCCD (http://www.ec.gc.ca/dccha-ahccd/) Tonkin site from 1942 to 2012. Tonkin, Saskatchewan, is 40 km northwest of the University of Saskatchewan meteorological station and 20 km east of Yorkton. To include 2013 and 2014 in the analysis, data from Environment Canada Tonkin station were used. Missing data accounted for ~0.7%.\n\nStreamflow and runoff mechanism\n\nStreamflow data were obtained from Environment Canada's Water Survey of Canada (WSC) archived hydrometric database online (http://www.wsc.ec.gc.ca). The stream gauge has been operated by the WSC (station 05ME007) since 1975. Available from WSC were daily, monthly and annual streamflow discharge. Streamflow data from 2014 are provisional as flow data have not undergone quality control by WSC. Because of the station being inundated during the flood of 2014, 22 missing days of daily discharge data were linearly interpolated using manual measurements.\n\nIn order to separate the streamflow into various runoff mechanisms such as snowmelt, rainfall and mixed snowmelt and rainfall, observed daily temperature, rainfall, snowfall, discharge and snow on ground were used in a runoff estimation technique (Figure 2). It was assumed that no groundwater contributes to streamflow due to the lack of baseflow – the stream typically dries out after snowmelt runoff is complete. Streamflow is classified as being derived from snowmelt at the beginning of the spring freshet, which corresponds with rapid snowmelt. It remains classified as such until a daily rainfall of >5 mm occurs concomitantly with increasing discharge. If the discharge is >0.1 m3/s prior to the rainfall event or snow depth >0 cm, the streamflow is classified as a mixed snowmelt and rainfall runoff regime. If the stream is dry or discharge is <0.1 m3/s prior to the rainfall event and there is no recorded snow on the ground, the streamflow is classified as a rainfall runoff regime.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nTrend tests\n\nAll observed variables were examined for the existence of trends at daily, monthly and annual time scales. Because of differing data characteristics, two different statistical methods were used for to test for trends: the nonparametric Mann–Kendall statistical test along with linear regression was used for continuous data (e.g. precipitation amounts) while logistic regression was used for discrete data (e.g. number of events). All data were tested for serial correlation at 95% confidence levels prior to the trend test as serial correlation can influence test results (Yue et al., 2002). All tests were conducted in R, a statistical computing environment and language. The packages used for these tests were Kendall (McLeod, 2011) and R Stats (R Core Team, 2012). Trend tests were considered statistically significant at 5% level.\n\nChange point analysis\n\nIn order to identify shifts or changes in the direction of trends, change point analyses were conducted in R using the ‘changepoint’ package (Killick and Eckley, 2013). In this package, the Segment Neighbourhood was implemented to identify change points in the mean and variance. A detailed description of the Segment Neighbourhood method used can be found in Auger and Lawrence (1989). If change point lengths were less than 3 years, the maximum number of change points was reduced by one unit until all change point lengths were greater than 2 years to avoid spurious change points.\n\nTeleconnections\n\nClimate teleconnections such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscilation (PDO) and others have been shown to influence some annual streamflows in the Canadian Prairies; the influence is more frequently observed in the western portion of the region (St. Jacques et al., 2014). The influence of teleconnections on streamflow was conducted following the methodology of St. Jacques et al. (2010), which uses generalized least squares regression to model the impacts of climate oscillations. For this study, the average annual streamflow (based on daily flow values) is examined for the influence of the Southern Oscillation Index and PDO. R, an open-sourced statistical programming software and language, was used (R Core Team, 2012).\n\nResults\n\nLand use change\n\nSmith Creek Research Basin has been partially drained, with the extent of ponded area decreasing dramatically from 24% in 1958 to 12% in 2000 and then 10% in 2009, resulting in a 58% loss in ponded area (Figure 3, Table I). Drainage channel length increased fourfold from 1958 to 2000 and almost eightfold from 1958 to 2009, suggesting an increased rate of drainage in the 21st Century. Local farmers report that the rate of drainage (typically occurring in fall) increases following wetter spring conditions, which have commonly occurred in the last 20 years.\n\nSubstantial changes in agricultural land use and tillage practices have occurred between 1961 (Statistics Canada, 1961) and 2011 (Statistics Canada1). Crop land has become the dominant agricultural land use, increasing from 33% of total farm area to 60%. Pasture land slightly increased from 2% to 9%, while summer fallow decreased from 20% to 5% of total farm area. Woodland and wetlands (unimproved land) decreased substantially from 46% to 27%. Between 1991 (Statistics Canada, 1991) and 2011 (Statistics Canada2), the adoption of zero till practices has been considerable, increasing from less than 2% of seeded land to 34%. Conservation tillage (tillage retaining most of the residue on the surface) also increased from 25% to 47% whereas conventional tillage (tillage incorporating most crop residue into the soil) decreased substantially from 73% of seeded land to 19%.\n\nTemperature\n\nChanges in meteorological variables observed in SCRB are indicative of a changing climate. The average maximum, minimum and mean temperatures in SCRB for 1942 to 2014 are 7.3, −3.9 and 1.7 °C, respectively. Temperatures have increased significantly over this period (Figure 4, Table II), with the basin maximum increasing by 1.2 °C. At a monthly scale, significant increases in temperatures (p < 0.05) were found for January, March, June and September. The range of monthly increases is from 1.1 to 4.0 °C, with large increases in March of 3.5 °C. In contrast, October minimum temperatures have decreased significantly (p < 0.05).\n\nMaximum Minimum Mean Annual +1.2 — — January +4.0 — — March +3.4 +3.5 +3.5 June +1.2 +1.1 +1.1 September +3.2 — +2.1 October — −1.4 —\n\nPrecipitation and snowcover\n\nMean annual precipitation from 1942 to 2014 was found to be 442 mm, with rainfall accounting for 325 mm (73%) and snowfall 117 mm (27%; Figure 5). Although there are no significant trends (p > 0.1) or shifts in total annual precipitation, the increasing temperatures have led to a gradual phase change. Annual rainfall has significantly increased (p = 0.013) at a rate of 0.9 mm/year while annual snowfall has decreased (p = 0.102) by 0.5 mm/year. The result is a significant increase in the annual rainfall fraction of precipitation (p = 0.043; Figure 6) from 68% to 78% of annual precipitation between 1942 and 2014. Concurrently, snowfall fractions gradually decreased from 32% to 22%. On a monthly scale, rainfall fractions have significantly increasing in March (p = 0.006) with change points in 1963 and 1972 that ultimately quadrupled the mean rainfall fractions in March from 4.8% to 19.0%. Monthly rainfall fractions were only found to be changing in March, but there were significant increases in the amount of rainfall in March (p = 0.010), May (p = 0.034), June (p = 0.048) and October (p = 0.051). Mean monthly rainfall gradually became more concentrated in the early summer between 1942 and 2014; increasing from 1 to 4 mm in March, from 31 to 59 mm in May, from 58 to 92 mm in June and from 14 to 23 mm in October.\n\nThe number of multiple-day events has increased significantly by 50% (p = 0.029, Figure 7), yet the number of single-day events have not significantly changed (p > 0.1), resulting in an increase in the total number of rainfall events of 14% (p = 0.025). From 1942 to 2014, the annual number of multiple-day rainfall events has increased by 5 whereas the total number of rainfall events has increased by 3.5.\n\nGiven the decreases in snowfall and increases in temperatures (particularly in January and March), the maximum snow depth has significantly decreased from 1956 to 2012 (p < 0.001) at a rate of 8 cm/decade (Figure 8). The duration of continuous snowcover has decreased (p = 0.058), resulting in a significantly earlier first snow-free date (p = 0.042). On average, the duration of continuous snowcover is 128 days (~4.25 months), with the first snow-free date gradually moving from April 9 to March 26. Subsequent snowfalls can occur after the first snow-free date, but they tend to be small (<5 cm) and coverage short-lived.\n\nStreamflow\n\nAnnual streamflow volume in the SCRB has increased by 14-fold (significant at p < 0.001) over the period of record (Figure 9). The average annual streamflow volume from 1975 to 2014 is 9715 dam3, and change points were identified in 1994 and 2010 (Table III) that increased the mean annual volume. Streamflow volumes tripled between 1995 and 2010, a period that included the worst multi-year drought (1999–2004) on the Canadian Prairies (Bonsal and Wheaton, 2005). The second change point marked the beginning of one of the wettest years on record in the northern portion of the Canadian Prairies (Chun and Wheater, 2012) with 498.8 mm of rainfall in 2010 which ranked 2nd highest since streamflow records started. During the last changepoint, the Assiniboine Watershed (including the SCRB) experienced widespread flooding in 2011 and 2014. Annual average streamflows were not found to be correlated to the PDO (R2 = 0.329) or Southern Oscillation Index (R2 = 0.281), although the 40 years of available data mainly encompassed the positive phase of the PDO (1977 to 2007; St. Jacques et al., 2014).\n\n1975–1994 1995–2010 2011–2014 Annual runoff 3000 9900 42 700 Snowmelt runoff 2600 7210 17 880 Mixed runoff 300 860 11 500 Rainfall runoff 80 1800 13 350\n\nNot only has the volume of runoff increased within the SCRB, but the runoff mechanisms that produce streamflow have shifted throughout the study period as evidenced from increased contributions from snowmelt, mixed and rainfall runoff since 1975 (Table III and Figure 9). Despite observed decreases in snowfall amounts, annual streamflow volume derived from snowmelt runoff has increased fivefold. Annual mixed snowmelt–rainfall runoff volumes have increased 34-fold and rainfall runoff volumes have increased 150-fold. The substantial increase in rainfall runoff may in part be due to the timing of the increased rainfall amounts since 1942 primarily in May and June (28 and 34 mm, respectively) mainly in the form of multiple-day rainfall events. The timing of such events is occurring shortly after the snowmelt season when basin conditions are still relatively wet.\n\nAlthough streamflow volume derived from all forms of runoff increased and contributed to extensive flooding after the second change point, the increases were not the same for all forms and favoured rainfall-runoff mechanisms; for instance, snowmelt and mixed runoff volumes increased threefold, and rainfall runoff volume increased 23-fold after the first change point and before the second change point. Prior to the first change point in 1994, snowmelt runoff accounted for 86% of the annual streamflow within SCRB, a value consistent with Gray and Landine's (1988) estimate for the Canadian Prairies of >80%. Since then, the fraction of streamflow derived from snowmelt runoff have declined to 71% and then 47%, while mixed and rainfall runoff have increased to 29% and then 53%, suggesting a reversal of the basin from being snowmelt dominated to rainfall-runoff dominated (Table IV, Figure 9). After the first change point, decreases in the fraction of streamflow derived from snowmelt runoff were offset by increases in the fraction of rainfall runoff. These changes were further amplified after the second change point, with the additional increase in the fraction of streamflow derived from mixed runoff. The substantial changes in runoff mechanisms after the second change point are primarily due to rain-induced high flows in 2012 and flooding in 2014. These floods account for a majority of the runoff in those years. Further, streamflow during the 2011 flood was dominated by mixed runoff as there was high rainfall shortly following snowmelt. This event marked a change point in the fraction of streamflow derived from mixed snowmelt and rainfall runoff.\n\n1975–1994 (%) 1995–2010 (%) 2010–2014 (%) Snowmelt runoff 86 71 47 Mixed runoff 7 6 19 Rainfall runoff 7 23 34\n\nRunoff ratios were evaluated in order to gain greater insight into runoff generation processes within the SCRB. Runoff ratio is the fraction of precipitation that falls within the basin that becomes streamflow. From 1975 to 2014, runoff ratios increased significantly (p < 0.001; Figure 10), and the period was marked by two change points occurring in 1994 and 2010. The change points shifted the mean annual runoff ratios from 0.019 prior to 1994 to 0.057 in 1995–2010, and then to 0.22 after 2011. The shifts in runoff ratios were coincident with shifts in annual streamflow volume and amount to a 12-fold increase in runoff ratio over the period of record.\n\nFigure 11 depicts the maximum, minimum and mean hydrographs of the three change point time periods to facilitate further discussion of the dramatic changes in SCRB hydrological regime. It should be noted that each time period has a different length. From 1975 to 1994, streamflow in SCRB was dominated by snowmelt runoff and typically receded back to zero flow after the completion of snowmelt in spring. Negligible runoff occurred during the summer months. From 1995 to 2010, streamflow duration expanded into the summer months due to rainfall-runoff mechanisms and rain-on-snow contributed to generating higher runoff peaks in the spring period. The largest peak flow during this 1995 to 2010 period (1995) was caused by widespread spring flooding resulting from snowmelt satisfying depressional storage. Streamflow was first sustained throughout much of the summer in 2010. Hydrograph shapes are substantially different from other years in the 2011 – 2014 changepoint period. During this period, streamflow still peaked in spring because of snowmelt and mixed runoff, but there were second peaks that occurred in the summer months, not driven by snowmelt. Double peaks occurred in 2012 and 2014, with the rainfall driven peak being larger than the snowmelt peak in both years.\n\nNot only has the volume of runoff and streamflow increased within the SCRB but the peak discharge has also increased substantially (Figure 12). There is greater uncertainty in peak discharge values than lower discharges because the culvert at the gauging station was inundated during peak flow in 1995, 2011 and 2014. There are also differences in natural unimpeded flows and those at the gauging station due to impoundment of flows and the formation of a temporary lake upstream of the gauge due to restricted flow through the culvert and the damming effect of a road above the culvert. There are several roads and culverts in the basin that act to funnel and obstruct streamflow during extremely high flows. From 1975 to 2014, mean annual peak discharge at Smith Creek significantly increased (p = 0.006), with a change point occurring in 1994. Prior to the change point, mean annual peak discharge was 3 m3/s, which tripled to 9.2 m3/s afterwards. The size of the culvert at the outlet of the SCRB has not changed since the WSC gauging station was installed at the inlet to the culvert in 1975. However, the roadway above the culvert was built up to prevent being washed out after the 1995 flood, allowing for a higher head, which can increase the flow rate (Smith, 1985) through the outlet culvert. Impacts of this alteration are only likely during extremely high flows wherein the culvert is overtopped and upstream ponding occurs. In these cases, a whirlpool forms over the inlet – whirlpools were observed in 2011 and 2014. Changes in culvert size thus cannot fully explain the tripling of peak discharge after 1994.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe climate, land use and hydrological regime of SCRB have changed dramatically in the last half-century. As compared with changes in streamflow, changes to the climate are modest, but changes in drainage are similarly dramatic. The annual amount of precipitation to the basin has not significantly changed over time, which differed from the average increase of 9% across the PPR presented in Millet et al. (2009). Tremendous changes were observed in the way precipitation is delivered, which may be a factor impacting streamflow. Despite decreases in snowfall amounts, the absolute volume of streamflow derived from snowmelt runoff has increased. The maximum depth of snow has gradually decreased, and the timing of snowcover depletion is occurring 2 weeks earlier (March 26). The increase in March rainfall may have increased the frequency or spatial extent of ice layers at the base of the snowpack. Ice layers restrict the infiltration of snowmelt water into frozen soils (Gray et al., 2001) and can cause almost all snowmelt to form runoff. Increases in rainfall amounts (predominantly in May and June) combined with the increased frequency of multiple-day rainfall events in the summer months have almost certainly contributed to the increase in the amount of mixed and rainfall runoff observed at the basin scale.\n\nGradual changes to the character of precipitation cannot fully explain the 14-fold increase in streamflow volumes, 12-fold increase in runoff ratio and tripling of peak discharge over the period of record. The last change point (2011 to 2014) is short in duration because of the availability of data at the time of the study. Future analysis on subsequent years as they become available will determine the length and the following shift direction. Although flow frequency analysis was not conducted, it is clear that the hydrological regime of Smith Creek is non-stationary. Research in the prairie region has shown that not only do changes in precipitation influence streamflow but so do anthropogenic changes (St. Jacques et al., 2010; Miller and Nudds, 1996). In the SCRB, over 58% of the ponded area has been lost due to drainage. The drainage channels that have been created are generally well-engineered, allowing for little to no residual depressional storage. Farmers in the basin have openly stated that they amplify their drainage efforts in flood years to reduce the amount of water sitting on the landscape and associated economic losses.\n\nModelling studies have concluded that wetland drainage increases annual and peak daily flows, as well as the magnitude and frequency of flooding (Gleason et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2010; Pomeroy et al., 2014). Streamflow generation from runoff is mainly controlled by depressional storage (Shook et al., 2015), and draining depressions increases the contributing area to streamflow (Brannen et al., in press). Comparable results were presented in Miller and Nudds (1996) who concluded that landscape alteration caused an increase in runoff in unregulated rivers, as there were no changes to the amount of precipitation. Ponded area in SCRB was reduced by 14% and drainage channel lengths increased by 185% from 2000 to 2009. The 12-fold increase in runoff ratios from the 1970s to the current decade reflects factors such as changing precipitation delivery, infiltration capacity, contributing area and depressional storage of the basin, all of which are affected by changes in climate and land use. While spring infiltration rates may have dropped due to March rainfall increases and the greater number of summer multiple-day rainfall events in May and June can increase summer runoff, the marked increase in late spring and summer flows due primarily to increasing mixed and rainfall runoff is disproportionate to these climate change impacts. Given that over half the ponded area was drained and drainage channel length increased eightfold in the last 56 years, both the depressional storage capacity was decreased and contributing area was increased. It is therefore highly likely that the increase in runoff ratios, along with annual streamflow volumes and peak discharge, is partly driven by enhanced drainage.\n\nPrimary changes in agricultural land use in the SCRB include substantial increases in crop land and the extensive adoption of zero and conservation tillage practices. On the Canadian Prairies, the conversion of land use to cropland decreases infiltration in the spring (van der Kamp et al., 2003; Pomeroy et al., 2010) due to the destruction of macropores (van der Kamp et al., 2003), yet the shorter plant height results in decreased snow accumulation due to increased blowing snow sublimation (Pomeroy et al., 2010). Results from a modelling study in the SCRB found that spring streamflows were relatively unaffected (−2%) under complete conversion to cropland (Pomeroy et al., 2010). Runoff differences under conservation and zero tillage practices have been shown to have little effect during the snowmelt period yet can effectively reduce runoff during the growing season (Elliott et al, 2001; Tiessen et al., 2010). As a result, it is likely that such changes have had little effect on the streamflow in the SCRB and may even act to reduce runoff during the summer months when the largest changes in streamflow have been observed. Further diagnostic hydrological process studies are needed to gain a better understanding of how land use change, including drainage, influences streamflow in this and similar basins.\n\nThe results from this study confirm and help explain many findings of recent research conducted on the Canadian Prairies. Ehsanzadeh et al. (2012a, 2014) suggested that changes in precipitation inputs would result in sudden changes to streamflow, which appears to be supported here in that a dramatic increase in streamflow volume occurred with changes in the delivery but not the annual volume of precipitation. The disproportionate response of streamflow to such changes may in part be due to the dynamic nature of the contributing area (Ehsanzadeh et al., 2012a). Many studies have shown the importance of depressional storage effects on streamflow generation (Gleason et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2010; Shook et al., 2015), which affects the shape and slope of the flow frequency curve (Ehsanzadeh et al., 2012b), and such non-stationary effects may be becoming apparent in SCRB as depressional storage declines with drainage. Increased streamflow and runoff ratios for the SCRB were also presented in Ehsanzadeh et al. (2014), yet the lack of long-term trends in the Assiniboine River and across the Canadian Prairies in Ehsanzadeh et al. (2012a, 2014) is not supported by the data and detailed analysis for SCRB shown here, where there are strong and statistically significant trends for increasing discharge. It may be that the impact of river regulation on the statistical analysis employed by Ehsanzadeh et al. (2012a, 2014) masked the ability to detect increased runoff from the many creeks. Unfortunately, as most unregulated creeks and rivers in the region are ungauged, it is not possible to assess at larger scales whether the unregulated flows show non-stationarity due to changes in basin hydrology in the same manner as this study has shown for SCRB.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe hydrological regime of the SCRB has changed substantially. Drainage has increased in the basin over the last 56 years, reducing the ponded area extent by 58% and increasing drainage channel length 780% between 1958 and 2009. The climate change observed within the basin is indicative of warming, with air temperatures increasing substantially and the greatest increases occurring in early spring. In response, the rainfall fraction of total precipitation has gradually increased, with the greatest shift from snowfall to rainfall events in March. Snowfall amounts have decreased along with the maximum depth of snow, resulting in snowmelt occurring 2 weeks earlier. The frequency of multiple-day rainfall events has increased by 50% and this may reflect greater frontal precipitation rather than convective precipitation mechanism. Increased rainfall has predominately occurred in May and June, which is shortly after the snowmelt season ends and the basin is still relatively wet.\n\nStreamflow volumes, runoff ratios and peak discharge have increased dramatically since 1975, with large shifts occurring in 1994 and 2010. Despite decreases in snowfall amounts, the volume of streamflow derived from snowmelt has increased. However, vastly increased discharge contributions from rainfall and mixed rainfall–snowmelt runoff processes have changed the fraction of streamflow derived from various runoff mechanisms; fraction of snowmelt runoff decreased and rainfall runoff increased. Mean annual peak discharge and runoff ratios tripled after 1994, and runoff ratios then almost quintupled after 2010.\n\nIt is unlikely that any single change is responsible for the dramatic shift in SCRB hydrology. The substantial but gradual changes to the character of precipitation cannot fully explain the 14-fold increase in streamflow volumes, 12-fold increase in runoff ratios, transformation from snowmelt dominated to rainfall dominated runoff and tripling of peak discharge. This rapid shift in hydrology is likely due to a non-linear or threshold-like response to combinations of a changing climate, exacerbated by changes in land use and recent increases in drainage. Therefore, it is critical to consider the influence that land use change, including drainage, exerts on prairie basin hydrology under a changing climate. Further diagnostic investigation using process hydrology simulations is needed to fully explain the mechanisms behind the observed regime changes.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was supported by funds were from the Canada Research Chairs Programme, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Ducks Unlimited Canada, Environment Canada, Agriculture and Agrifood Canada, Manitoba Water Stewardship, Saskatchewan Water Security Agency and the University of Saskatchewan.
