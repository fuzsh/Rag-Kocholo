        "text": "Context 1\n\n... Creek Research Basin has been partially drained, with the extent of ponded area decreasing dramatically from 24% in 1958 to 12% in 2000 and then 10% in 2009, resulting in a 58% loss in ponded area ( Figure 3, Table I). Drainage channel length increased fourfold from 1958 to 2000 and almost eightfold from 1958 to 2009, suggesting an increased rate of drainage in the 21st Century. Local farmers report that the rate of drainage (typically occurring in fall) increases following wetter spring conditions, which have commonly occurred in the last 20 years. Substantial changes in agricultural land use and tillage practices have occurred between 1961 (Statistics Canada, 1961) and 2011 (Statistics Canada 1 ). Crop land has become the dominant agricultural land use, increasing from 33% of total farm area to 60%. Pasture land slightly increased from 2% to 9%, while summer fallow decreased from 20% to 5% of total farm area. Woodland and wetlands (unimproved land) decreased substantially from 46% to 27%. Between 1991 (Statistics Canada, 1991) and 2011 (Statistics Canada 2 ), the adoption of zero till practices has been considerable, increasing from less than 2% of seeded land to 34%. Conservation tillage (tillage retaining most of the residue on the surface) also increased from 25% to 47% whereas conventional tillage (tillage incorporating most crop residue into the soil) decreased substantially from 73% of seeded land to 19%. Changes in meteorological variables observed in SCRB are indicative of a changing climate. The average maximum, minimum and mean temperatures in SCRB for 1942 to 2014 are 7.3, À 3.9 and 1.7 °C, respectively. Temperatures have increased signi fi cantly over this period (Figure 4, Table II), with the basin maximum increasing by 1.2 °C. At a monthly scale, signi fi cant increases in temperatures ( p < 0.05) were found for January, March, June and September. The range of monthly increases is from 1.1 to 4.0 °C, with large increases in March of 3.5 °C. In contrast, October minimum temperatures have decreased signi fi cantly ( p < 0.05). Mean annual precipitation from 1942 to 2014 was found to be 442 mm, with rainfall accounting for 325 mm (73%) and snowfall 117 mm (27%; Figure 5). Although there are no signi fi cant trends ( p > 0.1) or shifts in total annual precipitation, the increasing temperatures have led to a gradual phase change. Annual rainfall has signi fi cantly increased ( p = 0.013) at a rate of 0.9 mm/year while annual snowfall has decreased ( p = 0.102) by 0.5 mm/ year. The result is a signi fi cant increase in the annual rainfall fraction of precipitation ( p = 0.043; Figure 6) from 68% to 78% of annual precipitation between 1942 and 2014. Concurrently, snowfall fractions gradually decreased from 32% to 22%. On a monthly scale, rainfall fractions have signi fi cantly increasing in March ( p = 0.006) with change points in 1963 and 1972 that ultimately quadrupled the mean rainfall fractions in March from 4.8% to 19.0%. Monthly rainfall fractions were only found to be changing in March, but there were signi fi cant increases in the amount of rainfall in March ( p = 0.010), May ( p = 0.034), June ( p = 0.048) and October ( p = 0.051). Mean monthly rainfall gradually became more concentrated in the early summer between 1942 and 2014; increasing from 1 to 4 mm in March, from 31 to 59 mm in May, from 58 to 92 mm in June and from 14 to 23 mm in October. The number of multiple-day events has increased signi fi cantly by 50% ( p = 0.029, Figure 7), yet the number of single-day events have not signi fi cantly changed ( p > 0.1), resulting in an increase in the total number of rainfall events of 14% ( p = 0.025). From 1942 to 2014, the annual number of multiple-day rainfall events has increased by 5 whereas the total number of rainfall events has increased by 3.5. Given the decreases in snowfall and increases in temperatures (particularly in January and March), the maximum snow depth has signi fi cantly decreased from 1956 to 2012 ( p < 0.001) at a rate of 8 cm/decade (Figure 8). The duration of continuous snowcover has decreased ( p = 0.058), resulting in a signi fi cantly earlier fi rst snow- free date ( p = 0.042). On average, the duration of continuous snowcover is 128 days (~4.25 months), with the fi rst snow- free date gradually moving from April 9 to March 26. Subsequent snowfalls can occur after the fi rst snow-free date, but they tend to be small ( < 5 cm) and coverage short-lived. Annual stream ow volume in the SCRB has increased by 14-fold (signi fi cant at p < 0.001) over the period of record (Figure 9). The average annual stream fl ow volume from 1975 to 2014 is 9715 dam 3 , and change points were identi fi ed in 1994 and 2010 (Table III) that increased the mean annual volume. Stream fl ow volumes tripled between 1995 and 2010, a period that included the worst multi-year drought (1999 – 2004) on the Canadian Prairies (Bonsal and Wheaton, 2005). The second change point marked the beginning of one of the wettest years on record in the northern portion of the Canadian Prairies (Chun and Wheater, 2012) with 498.8 mm of rainfall in 2010 which ranked 2nd highest since stream fl ow records started. During the last changepoint, the Assiniboine Watershed (including the SCRB) experienced widespread fl ooding in 2011 and 2014. Annual average stream fl ows were not found to be correlated to the PDO ( R 2 = 0.329) or Southern Oscillation Index ( R 2 = 0.281), although the 40 years of available data mainly encompassed the positive phase of the PDO (1977 to 2007; St. Jacques et al ., 2014). Not only has the volume of runoff increased within the SCRB, but the runoff mechanisms that produce stream fl ow have shifted throughout the study period as evidenced from increased contributions from snowmelt, mixed and rainfall runoff since 1975 (Table III and Figure 9). Despite observed decreases in snowfall amounts, annual stream fl ow volume derived from snowmelt runoff has increased fi vefold. Annual mixed snowmelt – rainfall runoff volumes have increased 34-fold and rainfall runoff volumes have increased 150-fold. The substantial increase in rainfall runoff may in part be due to the timing of the increased rainfall amounts since 1942 primarily in May and June (28 and 34 mm, respectively) mainly in the form of multiple-day rainfall events. The timing of such events is occurring shortly after the snowmelt season when basin conditions are still relatively wet. Although stream fl ow volume derived from all forms of runoff increased and contributed to extensive fl ooding after the second change point, the increases were not the same for all forms and favoured rainfall-runoff mechanisms; for instance, snowmelt and mixed runoff volumes increased threefold, and rainfall runoff volume increased 23-fold after the fi rst change point and before the second change point. Prior to the fi rst change point in 1994, snowmelt runoff accounted for 86% of the annual stream fl ow within SCRB, a value consistent with Gray and Landine ’ s (1988) estimate for the Canadian Prairies of > 80%. Since then, the fraction of stream fl ow derived from snowmelt runoff have declined to 71% and then 47%, ..."
