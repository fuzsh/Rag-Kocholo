        "text": "May 24, 2023 | 5:00 PM\n\nIt’s no surprise that Saskatchewan is dealing with so many wildfires as many communities are currently experiencing historically dry conditions.\n\nAccording to Environment and Climate Change Canada, the first two weeks of May were the driest on record for this time of year for Prince Albert, Saskatoon, Yorkton, and Meadow Lake.\n\nThe weather agency has 138 years of data for P.A., 126 years for Saskatoon, 115 years for Yorkton, and 74 years for Meadow Lake.\n\nWhile not topping their own list, the dry conditions in other communities across the province are also some of the worst in their history.\n\n“It’s been a very, very dry and abnormally hot start to May,” said Sara Hoffman, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.\n\nThe lack of precipitation has helped start and spread several wildfires. According to the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency (SPSA), there have been 184 fires this year which is above the five-year average of 109 for this time of year.\n\nIt’s been even worse for Alberta. Wildfire officials say more than 10,000 square kilometres of land has already burned in the province.\n\nThe record for an entire season was set in 1984 at roughly 13,000 square kilometres. Other years with large fires, including 2016 which had the Fort McMurray wildfire, had better overall seasons.\n\nAlong with being dry, Alberta is also experiencing some of the hottest conditions they’ve ever had in May.\n\n“A number of sites, including Edmonton which has 142 years of data, are on track to be the warmest May on record,” said Hoffman.\n\nSaskatchewan is also dealing with abnormally high temperatures, but not record-breaking. P.A. is dealing with its 10th hottest start to May, while Yorkton is having its 19th.\n\nMeanwhile, the rain many communities in the province have gotten over the past couple of days is expected to help ease the harsh dry conditions.\n\nThe amount of precipitation has actually allowed the SPSA to lift its provincial fire ban on all Crown lands, provincial parks, and the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District north of Highway 16. Some communities have also lifted their own bans; however, many still have theirs in effect.\n\n-With files from CKOM News and The Canadian Press\n\n—\n\nJaryn.Vecchio@pattisonmedia.com\n\nOn Twitter: @princealbertnow"
