Each place has a total for how many days of wet weather it usually gets a year and for the normal amount of precipitation.\n\nYou can jump to a separate table for each section of the province: Southern, Central and Northern Saskatchewan.\n\nThe calculation of days only includes the days when precipitation totalled at least 0.2 millimetres (0.008 inches). The annual amount of precipitation is an average of weather data collected during 1981 to 2010."
