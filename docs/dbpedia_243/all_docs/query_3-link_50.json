        "text": "Itâ€™s going to be a hot and smoky week across the province as a heat wave has struck parts of northern Saskatchewan and forest fire smoke from northern Alberta is infiltrating southern regions of Saskatchewan.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada has issued a number of air quality statements affecting the Regina, Moose Jaw, Swift Current, Kindersley, Saskatoon, Prince Albert, Yorkton, Melville, Weyburn, and Estevan regions. According to the weather office, a weak surface level ridge is bringing in the smoke and haze, which can cause problems for those with breathing problems. Conditions are expected to improve by this evening.\n\nCLICK HERE to see an interactive map of forest fire smoke across western Canada.\n\nEnvironment Canada and Climate Change has also issued heat warnings for the Unity/Wilkie area, as far north as Lake Athabasca, and as far east as the Sandy Bay and Pelican narrows region. Meteorologists are predicting this heat wave will last three to five days and bringing 30 degree Celsius and higher temperatures throughout the day. Lows of 16 degrees are expected at night.\n\nHeat is in the forecast for Country Thunder Saskatchewan, which kicks off on Thursday evening. Both Precision Weather and Environment Canada are forecasting daytime temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius or higher."
