        "text": "The water bodies of the Saskatchewan Prairies suffer multiple stressors, and demand for water is expected to increase. Water quality models can help evaluate water management strategies and risks such as climate change. This study assesses the impact of interbasin water transfers on the water quality of a strategic, eutrophic prairie reservoir that receives poor-quality watershed runoff. A one-dimensional WASP model was used to estimate nutrient transformations in the transfers along a 97 km river channel. The WASP model was then loosely coupled to a two-dimensional CE-QUAL-W2 model of the downstream receiving reservoir. Output from the WASP model was manually transformed into boundary conditions for the CE-QUAL-W2 reservoir model. This method improves on an earlier attempt to estimate nutrient transformations in the transfers using linear regression. Results from the loosely coupled models suggest Buffalo Pound Lake would respond well to the interbasin transfers. The number of threshold exceedances decreased for all modeled water quality variables. Nutrient concentrations were most influenced in the open water season following spring freshet. Any additional reduction of threshold exceedances during winter was minimal in comparison. These results are interesting from a management perspective as increased transfers under winter operations risk ice damage to the river channel.\n\nThe main objective of this research was to understand the effects of climate change on soil water content (SWC) across the Qu’Appelle River basin in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and output from 11 high-resolution (0.22°) regional climate models (RCM) were used over three 30-year periods: the near future (2021–2050) and distant future (2051–2080) and the historical reference (1975–2005). The RCM data are from the CORDEX North American domain, which employs the RCP8.5 high-emission scenario. SWC was modeled at the hydrological response units (HRU) level and at daily and monthly (warm season only) intervals for 2015–2020. The model was calibrated and validated using SUFI-2 in SWAT-CUP based on observations for streamflow and SWC, including measured data and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 for surface (up to 5 cm deep) soil moisture. Values of the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (NS) ranged from 0.616 and 0.784 and the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.8 for calibration and 0.82 for validation. Likewise, the correlation coefficients between ground measurements and SWAT were 0.698 and 0.633, respectively. Future climate forcing of the calibrated SWAT model revealed that warmer and drier growing seasons will prevail in the region. Similarly, the ensemble of all RCMs indicated that the mean temperature will increase by 2.1 °C and 3.4 °C for the middle and late periods, respectively, along with a precipitation increase of 10% and 11.2%. SWC is expected to decrease with an increase in potential evapotranspiration, despite an increase in precipitation. Likewise, the annual SWC is expected to decrease by 3.6% and 4% in the middle and late periods, respectively. The monthly SWC changes showed the highest decreases (5.4%) in April in the late period. The spatial pattern of SWC for 11 RCMs was similar such that the northwest and west of the river basin are wetter than the south and east. SWC projections suggest that southern Saskatchewan could experience significant SWC deficiencies in the summer by the end of this century.\n\nAn assessment of evaporation losses from soils is critical for sustainable agriculture in semi-arid regions. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of desaturation and shrinkage on evaporative flux from representative soils. Results indicated that the surface area did not change for silty sand (6% volume reduction) and substantially increased for lean clay (17% volume reduction). The evaporative flux for silty sand decreased from 31 to 25 mg/m2∙s in Stage II, remained constant during Stage III, and decreased to 11 mg/m2∙s in Stage IV. In contrast, the lean clay showed a longer Stage II (34 to 14 mg/m2∙s), a near constant Stage III, albeit a similar Stage IV (13 to 3 mg/m2∙s). The air entry and residual suction values were 1 kPa and 100 kPa for silty sand and 5 kPa and 1400 kPa for lean clay. In both soils, the total suction merged with the matric suction at Stage II–Stage III boundary. Furthermore, the shrinkage curve was J-shaped for silty sand with the only void ratio decrease in Stage II, whereas that for the lean clay showed a significant void ratio decrease in Stage II, marginal decrease in Stage III, and no decrease in Stage IV. Under high demand, the silty sand exhibited Stage III and Stage IV evaporation, whereas the lean clay also showed significant flux during Stage II. For the investigated range of water content, the total water loss under high demand was found to be 7 times that under low demand.\n\nImprovement of dendrochronological crops yield reconstruction by separate application of earlywood and latewood width chronologies succeeded in rain fed semiarid region. (1) Background: Tree‐ring width chronologies have been successfully applied for crops yield reconstruction models. We propose application of separated earlywood and latewood width chronologies as possible predictors improving the fitness of reconstruction models. (2) Methods: The generalized yield series of main crops (spring wheat, spring barley, oats) were investigated in rain‐fed and irrigated areas in semiarid steppes of South Siberia. Chronologies of earlywood, latewood, and total ring width of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) growing in forest‐steppe in the middle of the study area were tested as predictors of yield reconstruction models. (3) Results: In the rain‐fed territory, separation of earlywood and latewood allowed increasing variation of yield explained by reconstruction model from 17.4 to 20.5%, whereas total climatic‐driven component of variation was 41.5%. However, both tree‐ring based models explained only 7.7% of yield variation in the irrigated territory (climate inclusion increased it to 34.8%). Low temperature sensitivity of larch growth was the main limitation of the model. A 240‐year (1780–2019) history of crop failures and yield variation dynamics were estimated from the actual data and the best reconstruction model. (4) Conclusions: Presently in the study region, breeding of the environment‐resistant crops varieties compensates the increase of temperature in the yield dynamics, preventing severe harvest losses. Tree‐ring based reconstructions may help to understand and forecast response of the crops to the climatic variability, and also the probability of crop failures, particularly in the rain‐fed territories.\n\nLong-term water resource management requires the capacity to evaluate alternative management options in the face of various sources of uncertainty in the future conditions of water resource systems. This study proposes a generic framework for determining the relative change in probabilistic characteristics of system performance as a result of changing water availability, policy options and irrigation expansion. These probabilistic characteristics can be considered to represent the risk of failure in the system performance due to the uncertainty in future conditions. Quantifying the relative change in the performance risk can provide a basis for understanding the effects of multiple changing conditions on the system behavior. This framework was applied to the water resource system of the Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB) in Saskatchewan, Canada. A “bottom-up” flow reconstruction algorithm was used to generate multiple realizations for water availability within a feasible range of change in streamflow characteristics. Consistent with observed data and projected change in streamflow characteristics, the historical streamflow was perturbed to stochastically generate feasible future flow sequences, based on various combinations of changing annual flow volume and timing of the annual peak. In addition, five alternative policy options, with and without potential irrigation expansion, were considered. All configurations of water availability, policy decisions and irrigation expansion options were fed into a hydro-economic water resource system model to obtain empirical probability distributions for system performance – here overall and sectorial net benefits – under the considered changes. Results show that no one specific policy can provide the optimal option for water resource management under all flow conditions. In addition, it was found that the joint impacts of changing water availability, policy, and irrigation expansion on system performance are complex and resemble nonlinear functions of changes in individual drivers. The proposed risk-based framework can be linked to any water resource system assessment scheme to quantify the risk in system performance under changing conditions, with the larger goal of proposing alternative policy options to address future uncertainties and management concerns.\n\nA stochastic production function was estimated to investigate the effect of fertilizer inputs, changes in weather conditions and the use of improved varieties on barley and canola yields and its variability in Manitoba. Adoption of improved barley varieties did not have a significant effect on yield, while the adoption of herbicide-tolerant hybrid canola varieties was positively correlated with yield. An increasingly warmer climate in Manitoba is expected to have a slightly negative effect on mean barley yield and yield variance. In contrast, a warmer climate is expected to have a negligible effect on mean canola yield, but a positive effect on yield variability. Our results showed that a projected 50% increase in growing degree days would lead to a decrease of less than 1% in barley and canola yields.\n\nThis analysis uses over 50 years of hourly observations of temperature, relative humidity, and opaque cloud cover and daily precipitation from 11 climate stations across the Canadian Prairies to analyze the monthly, seasonal and long-term climate coupling in the warm season. On climate timescales, temperature depends on cloud forcing, while relative humidity depends on precipitation. The monthly climate depends on both opaque cloud cover for the current month and precipitation for both the present and past 2 months in summer. Multiple linear regression shows that anomalies of opaque cloud and precipitation explain 60-80% of the variance in the diurnal temperature range, afternoon relative humidity and lifting condensation level on monthly timescales. We analyze the internal coupling of diurnal climate observables as a further guide to evaluating models. We couple the statistics to simplified energy and water budgets for the Prairies in the growing season. The opaque cloud observations have been calibrated against the incoming shortwave and longwave fluxes. We estimate that the dry-down of total water storage on the landscape damps 56% of precipitation anomalies for the growing season on large spatial scales, although this drydown increases evapotranspiration. This couples the climatological surface fluxes to four key observables: cloud forcing, precipitation, temperature and humidity. We estimate a climatological evaporative fraction of 0.61 for the Prairies. The observational relationships of the coupled Prairie climate system across timescale will be useful for evaluating these coupled processes in models for weather and seasonal forecasting and climate simulation.\n\nThis analysis uses over 50 years of hourly observations of temperature, relative humidity, and opaque cloud cover and daily precipitation from 11 climate stations across the Canadian Prairies to analyze the monthly and seasonal climate coupling in the warm season. The opaque cloud observations have been calibrated against the incoming shortwave flux and longwave flux, so knowing the cloud forcing terms, we can estimate net radiation, and analyze the coupled energy and water budgets. On climate timescales, temperature depends on cloud forcing, while relative humidity depends on precipitation. The monthly climate depends on both opaque cloud cover for the current month and precipitation for both the present and past 2 months in summer. Multiple linear regression shows that anomalies of opaque cloud and precipitation explain 60-80% of the variance in the diurnal temperature range and afternoon relative humidity on monthly timescales. For the May to August growing season, we use the GRACE satellite data to show that the dry-down of soil moisture damps 55% of the precipitation anomalies. This enables us to estimate surface evapotranspiration, close the energy and water budgets for the growing season, and estimate the mean evaporative fraction is 0.57 for the Prairies. Our analysis couples the surface fluxes to four key observables: cloud forcing, precipitation, temperature and humidity. Finally we review how the regression coefficients relating summer climate variables change with time-scale.\n\nQuaking or trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests occur in highly diverse settings across North America. However, management of distinct communities has long relied on a single aspen-to-conifer successional model. We examine a variety of aspen-dominated stand types in the western portion of its range as ecological systems, avoiding an exclusive focus on seral dynamics or single-species management. We build a case for a large-scale functional aspen typology based on the existing literature. Aspen functional types are defined as aspen communities that differ markedly in their physical and biological processes. The framework presented here describes two “functional types” and seven embedded “subtypes”: seral (boreal and montane), stable (parkland, Colorado Plateau, elevation and aspect limited, and terrain isolated), and a crossover seral-stable subtype (riparian). The assessment hinges on a matrix comparing proposed functional types across a suite of environmental characteristics. Differences among functional groups based on physiological and climatic conditions, stand structures and dynamics, and disturbance types and periodicity are described herein. We further examine management implications and challenges, such as human alterations, ungulate herbivory, and climate futures, that affect the functionality of these aspen systems. The functional framework lends itself well to stewardship and research that seek to understand and emulate ecological processes rather than combat them. We see advantages of applying this approach to other widespread forest communities that engender diverse functional adaptations."
