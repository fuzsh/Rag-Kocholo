Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Yorkton is essentially constant during December, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 19, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 5% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Yorkton is essentially constant during December, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 11.0 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on March 30, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.9 miles per hour, while on July 30, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Yorkton throughout December is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 44% on December 28.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Yorkton typically lasts for 4.0 months (125 days), from around May 18 to around September 19, rarely starting before May 1 or after June 4, and rarely ending before September 2 or after October 6.\n\nThe month of December in Yorkton is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in December in Yorkton\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Yorkton are essentially constant during December, remaining around 1,634Â°F throughout.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Yorkton is essentially constant during December, remaining within 0.1 kWh of 1.0 kWh throughout.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during December is 0.9 kWh on December 18.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Yorkton are 51.217 deg latitude, -102.468 deg longitude, and 1,650 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Yorkton is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 85 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,657 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (154 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (945 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Yorkton is covered by cropland (53%) and artificial surfaces (43%), within 10 miles by cropland (85%) and grassland (11%), and within 50 miles by cropland (83%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Yorkton, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Yorkton.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Yorkton according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Yorkton is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Yorkton and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nYorkton Municipal Airport (CYQV, 96%, 3.3 mi, north, -16 ft elevation change)\n\nRoblin Man (CWXB, 1.8%, 48 mi, east, 121 ft elevation change)\n\nBroadview, Sask. (CWIK, 1.3%, 59 mi, south, 315 ft elevation change)\n\nIndian Head (CWBD, 1.0%, 69 mi, southwest, 249 ft elevation change)\n\nCYQV, 96%3 mi, -16 ftCWXB, 2%48 mi, 121 ftCWIK, 1%59 mi, 315 ftCWBD, 1%69 mi, 249 ft© OpenStreetMap contributors\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Yorkton and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
