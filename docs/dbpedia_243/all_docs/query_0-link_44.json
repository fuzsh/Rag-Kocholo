The most distinctive feature of the situation is the unmistakable revival in trade. The improvement is proceeding in a steadily widening circle. The buoyancy and activity manifest on our Stock Exchange this week in such a conspicuous degree are but a reflection of the growing betterment of trade affairs. At first it was merely the iron and steel industry—that most important of the country's industries—that revealed signs of new life. Now evidence to the same effect is discernible in many other quarters. It is marvelous what a transformation has occurred in men's hopes, and in their views also, within the period of the last twelve months. Just a year ago mercantile and industrial affairs were at their lowest ebb and the whole country was in the deepest despair. Confidence seemed to be completely gone and the outlook was gloomy in the extreme, with scarcely a bright spot on the industrial horizon. Now every one is buoyed up with new hope and the future is once more viewed with unabated confidence. The change is the more remarkable inasmuch as it comes at a period of the year when the disposition usually is to proceed with the utmost caution,and for obvious reasons. We have just entered upon a new crop season when the unavoidable uncertainties attending the raising of our mammoth supply of agricultural productions, upon which so much depends, are present in every one's mind,since experience teaches that the future course of trade will in large measure be controlled by the question whether the new stores of nature's bounties are to be meagre or abundant. No one can tell yet what the 1909 crops will amount to. Nevertheless our business men are going ahead even without knowledge on that point. The new hope which has sprung up in men's breasts also comes at a time when tariff legislation is still far from completed— indeed when as to many articles and schedules there is just as much doubt as to what the new tariff duties are to be as there was three or four months ago. When 1909 opened and trade began to lag after the spurt of activity which came in the closing months of 1908 with the assurance of the defeat of Mr. Bryan in his third attempt to grasp the Presidency, we were told that it was the uncertainties of tariff legislation that was keeping enterprise in check and placing an embargo upon trade. No doubt this was, and is even yet, an unsettling influence; for uncertainty of any kind is always a deterrent upon men's actions. But now, though this dampening influence is still present, business seems to be proceeding without regard to the same, and there is every evidence of a genuine and pronounced revival in trade. In a word, men once more have confidence in themselves and in one another. What is the reason for the rejuvenation? The ready reply will be that sentiment has changed. But why has sentiment changed? A year ago we were all controlled by fears and there was just ground for those fears. Now these fears have vanished. The causes were largely, if not entirely, political. And no one can deny that the political aspect, at least as far as national affairs are concerned, has been wholly altered. The transformation in that respect has been no less striking than the transformation in the trade situation. When business men proceeded so cautiously in January [VoL. Lxxxvm. and February of the present year, it was, in the main, with the view to awaiting and seeing what would be the policy and plans of the new Administration coming into power on the 4th of March. It is hardly needful to remind the reader of the depressing influence exerted by the late Administration or to recall the ebullitions of wrath, the denunciations of the courts, the assaults upon corporations and wealth, the attacks upon the railroads, and the crude propositions for reconstructing the industrial and economic fabric which were hurled at a suffering public with such painful frequency under that Administration. Would the new Administration follow a similar course? If so, then it were in vain to hope for a return of normal trade activity. Anxiety on that score was quickly allayed. The test came almost at the moment that the Administration took office; and Mr. Taft lost no time in making his position understood. On a re-trial of the celebrated action against the Standard Oil Co. in which a fine of $29,240,000 had been imposed, the trial judge was obliged to order an acquittal, since the prosecution had no case. We all know what bitter words President Roosevelt used last August when the United States Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Landis and how his every utterance breathed defiance of the courts. The new Administration treated the failure of its suit in a totally different way. It acted with dignity and composure. Through Attorney-General Wickersham it announced that it would be guided entirely by the rules laid down by the courts. There would be no litigation for sensational effect. Cases similar to the one that had failed would be abandoned and the legal department of the Government would hereafter make sure that the law had actually been violated before it attempted prosecution. Since then the Government has been acting in a similar sensible and dignified way, showing that its policy would be not to disturb but to assure the mercantile and financial world—that nothing would be done to threaten the security and stability of legitimate business interests. This is all that the public had been waiting for and all that any one could ask for. Here, then, we have the reason why business men have been taking new hope and trade activity has been spreading in all directions. Moreover, the fact that trade has quickened so decidedly, with assurance on that point, indicates what actually occasioned the panic of 1907 and the trade revulsion and convulsion that followed in 1908. No doubt a large part of our population never fully appreciated what a blighting influence upon trade the old political influences and methods had exerted. But the lesson, and the evidence of it, is now before them. It is in the highest degree gratifying that the old conditions are now behind us. Furthermore, in the change which has occurred to new and better conditions we manifestly have a sure foundation for enduring trade revival and for the glowing prospects of the future which are now being so generally entertained. A statement authorized by J. P. Morgan, Co. makes clear the details of the negotiations which this week have resulted in arrangements for the practical listing of United States Steel stocks on the Paris Bourse. It corrects some of the statements of a misleading character which appeared during the JUNE 5 1909.1 THE CHRONICLE week and discloses the far-reaching importance of the negotiation. It appears that a block of 100,000 shares of Steel common has been sold to a Paris syndicate, composed of Morgan, Harjes & Co., the Credit Lyonnais,the Comptoir Nationale d' Escomptes and the Societe Generale. This syndicate will issue its own certificates secured by the 100,000 shares of Steel common, and such certificates will be traded in on the Paris Bourse. It is stated that it had at no time been proposed to list any part of the Steel stock on the Bourse; to list only a small portion of 5,000,000 outstanding shares of common stock would have involved an expense of about $3 per share, which would have been prohibitory. Neither was it proposed to place any part of the 100,000 shares, as above noted, on the Paris market. All that was desired was to put the stock before the French investor and to enter into business relations which may eventually result in the investment of large amounts of French capital in American enterprises. The block of 100,000 shares of Steel above noted will not be transferred to Paris, but will be held in New York by the Bankers' Trust Company in trust for the syndicate; this company will collect the dividends thereon, forward them to the syndicate in Paris, and such syndicate will pay dividends in the same amount to the holders of its certificates. It is by an arrangement similar to this that many American stocks have been traded in at Amsterdam. The only American securities previously listed in Paris were a block of Pennsylvania Railroad bonds and a lot of New York New Haven & Hartford debentures. As the result of the announcement of the proposed listing of Steel in Paris, the stock had almost a continuous advance this week, not only in New York but in London and Paris. The Treasury deficit for May was $5,453,955 and for eleven months of the fiscal year ending with May $97,858,102. May's receipts from customs increased 83/ millions, compared with a year ago, but there was a nominal decrease as compared with last month. Internal revenue increased 1 million over May 1908 and there was a slight gain therein compared with last month. Disbursements for May were greater by 4 millions than those in the corresponding month last year. There was a decrease of $2,700,000 in civil and miscellaneous expenditures, compared with last month and an increase of 1 million on account of the Navy. Pensions payments show a gain of 3 millions and those for public works 33 millions compared with April. Engagements of $885,000 gold bars for shipment to Paris on Thursday were made profitable as an arbitrage operation through a rise in sterling at New York on London and an easier tone for exchange at Paris on the British capital. On Thursday the Paris rate on London sharply advanced, the result of active trading; but as sterling at New York on the British capital also rose, shipments of gold coin to Paris could not be advantageously effected. 1397 ing Government bond market conditions that attract attention. The fact is recognized that the Government has about exhausted its market for the certain sale at not less than par of any considerable amount of bonds bearing as low an interest rate as 2%. With the exception of 63 millions 3s of 1908-18, there are no bonds which may be refunded into consols and no public deposits that can be made to stimulate a market for Panama bonds. It seems necessary, however, that money shall be provided for the needs of the Government through new bond issues. In order that they may be marketed, when emitted, they will have to bear a rate of interest which will place them on an investment basis. To effect such purpose, though, they will come into competition with the consols and the Panamas,and, owing to the higher interest rate, the new bonds will be attractive while the consols and the Panamas will be discriminated against. It would be a breach of good faith and contrary to public policy for the Government to impart to the new bonds any privilege enjoyed by the 2%s, such as partial tax immunity on circulation bwd upon the new securities, which would give them an artificial price; neither would the extension of this partial tax immunity be necessary if the interest rate on the bonds were on an investment basis, for they should be regarded as on their merits alone. With a view, therefore, more firmly to establish an artificial price for the 2s and thus make the market receptive for more Panamas, it is suggested that the partial tax immunity enjoyed by circulation on the 2s be increased by reducing such circulation tax by one-half, or to IA of 1%. The tax would bear such a reduction,for collections thereunder are now three times the requirements for national bank administration; even at W of 1% the yield would be i 13 millions, while last year the expenditures chargeable to the tax fund were $527,000. The proposed tax reduction is, according to the circular, likely to be acted upon at the present emergency session of Congress. There are indications, as stated in the circular, that depository accounts must soon be reduced in order to increase the working balance of the Treasury. Such deposits now amount to 62 millions, of which 52 millions are in temporary or special depositories and the remainder in permanent or regular accounts. The former might be reduced by 20 millions without interfering with the business of thePepartment, and if this course were taken and the regular accounts to remain undisturbed, the above-noted 20 millions reduction would be the extent of the withdrawals. There is no necessity for the maintenance of the 10 millions balances in special depositories. These, however, are distributed among one 'thousand banks, many of which qualified largely for the purpose of being designated as a United States depository, and these and others bought bonds at high prices and have suffered loss through the shrinkage of the premium on such securities and also through the recall of their deposits from time to time. For these reasons the equities seem to be with the banks, and favor the retention of the depository accounts,unless the Treasury actually is forced to withdraw them. Bank managers who, for the benefit of their correspondents, make a study of situations which may be of interest to such correspondents have submitted The foreign exchange market was quite strong on in a recent circular some facts and suggestions regard- the resumption of business on Tuesday, after the 1398 THE CHRONICLE holiday, and, owing to a recession of half a centime in exchange at Paris on London,there were expectations of a renewal of the movement of gold hence to the French capital; such expectations were later in the week realized, when engagements of $885,000 gold were effected. On Saturday of last week $1,250,000 n gold coin was shipped to Argentina. Part of this consignment consisted of double eagles which were withdrawn from the Sub-Treasury; the remainder was in eagles that were obtained from the banks. The Bank of England on Tuesday secured the whole of the $5,000,000 Cape gold that was offered in the London bullion market on that day. The fact that Vienna bankers were not competitive bidders for the metal would seem to indicate that Austria's requirements for gold are satisfied. French bankers also refrained from bidding for the South African consignment, probably relying upon their ability to obtain the metal from New York, possibly on more advantageous terms. It appears by London mail advices that French bankers are large investors in South African mining stocks. Recently the Bank of Paris bought outright a block of about 50,000 shares of the Ferrera Deep mine, at the same time, it is reported, obtaining an option for an equal amount of the stock; this seems to indicate that as the result of cheap money the large banks at Paris, which have heretofore extensively traded in gold-mining shares through London, are now directing their attention to more or less permanent investments therein. The cotton crop situation at this time is set forth at such length on subsequent pages in our annual report on acreage that briefest reference to the subject will suffice here. According to our compilation, area has been further augmented by 1.05%, indicating that the freely tendered advice to curtail planting has been as usual ignored, and rightly so in view of the world's needs of the staple and the profit in raising it. That the increase in area has not been greater than mentioned above is accounted for by two causes—fear of boll-weevil invasion and high prices for grain. The first cause, operating in Louisiana,is responsible for a rather large reduction in acreage in that State, and also accounts for a small falling off in Mississippi. An increased planting of grain has served to hold down the gain in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas to very moderate proportions, and explains an actual slight loss in area along the Atlantic. So much has been said of late about the poor crop outlook that it becomes important to state that our investigations indicate a better promise at this date than at the corresponding time a year ago. Planting differed little,if at all,in the two years on the average; but weather conditions on the whole have been more favorable. The season has not, of course, been free from complaints of excess of moisture or lack of it, and low temperature has been referred to from time to time. Deficiency of rainfall in Texas was apparently the most serious drawback, but since the middle of May complaints on that score have practically ceased. All things considered, the outlook now would seem to be fairly promising, better than last year, and capable of further improvement under future normal meteorological conditions. [VOL. Bank clearings continue to make a very satisfactory exhibit, the completed results for the latest month (May) furnishing convincing evidence of the improvement in affairs as compared with a year ago. Moreover, the favorable May showing is not due to an important augmentation in dealings in stocks at New York or other speculative centres. On the contrary, the transactions at the New York Stock Exchange were smaller for the month this year than for the corresponding month a year ago, comparison being between 16,495,230 shares and 20,975,022 shares. Furthermore,the total for the five months of 1909,at 78,814,142 shares,is only moderately heavier than the aggregate (74,997,001 shares) for the similar interval of 1908. Bond dealings, however, continue noticeably larger and in excess of any former year. At the Boston Stock Exchange the month's sales were 1,346,426 shares, against 1,173,283 shares in May 1908, with the five months' results 5,877,501 shares and 4,575,431 shares respectively. As emphasizing the encouraging character of the latest returns of clearings, it is to be noted that of the 127 cities included in our May compilation on the first page of this issue, only 11 record losses from the previous year. Moreover, the gain for the whole country in May, as compared with the month of 1908, reaches 19.5%, and for the five months is 27.6%. Compared with two years ago, there is also an increase for the month (5%), but for the period since Jan. 1 a loss of 2.8% is exhibited. Outside of New York the gain in the total for May is 16.5% and for the five months 15.6% when contrasted with 1908, with the losses 2.8% and 1.2%, respectively, compared with 1907. Considering the returns by sections, we find that the middle group (which includes New York) exhibits a gain for the month of 20.4% over 1908 and for the period since Jan. 1 the increase reaches 33%. In the New England section the gains were 11.4% and 19.4% respectively, and for the Middle West 17.3% and 15.1%. Pacific Slope cities, without exception, recorded increases, the hggregate for the division for the month exceeding that for 1908 by 28.1%, with the five months' result a gain of 22%. Thp \"Other Western\" group records an excess in May of 15.7% and in the five months of 16.5%, as compared with 1908, and for the South the percentages of gain were 20% and 15.3% respectively. Clearings for the Dominion of Canada also make a very gratifying exhibit for May, each of the thirteen cities participating, and the same is true of the five months' result. For the shorter period the gain in the aggregate as compared with 1908, reaches 24.2% and contrasted with 1907 is 5.3%. For the five months the increases are 22.1% and 8.6%, respectively. Commercial failures for May 1909, while covering a smaller aggregate of liabilities than in April, were somewhat heavier than in the corresponding month of 1908. The exhibit is, therefore, by comparison less satisfactory than that for any month since August last. The poorer showing, moreover, is due in considerable measure to important failures among brokers, a status of affairs that was also a feature of the April showing. The disasters among brokers, however, have resulted largely, if not wholly,through speculation, and, although they have served to materially swell the aggregate of liabilities, cannot be taken as JUNE 5 1900 • THE CHRONICLE indicating any let-up in the progress toward normal business conditions. In fact, eliminating from the month's total the liabilities of brokers, we find the situation to be more favorable than a year ago. Of the brokerage failures referred to above, the most important in the liabilities involved were W. W. Tracy & Co., of this city, about $1,500,000, and Sederquist, Barry Sc Co., also of New York, half a million, these two concerns contributing much the greater part of the $2,253,377 indebtedness of brokers, transporters, Src., in May 1909. A total that compares with only $1,083,709 in the month of 1908 and $1,171,440 in 1907. Disasters among manufacturers, according to Messrs. R. G. Dun Sr Co.'s statement, stood for liabil ties of $7,156,140 in May of the current year, contrasting with $6,988,988 in the previous year and $4,758,725 in 1907. But in the trading division the showing is a favorable one, the month's indebtedness this year at $4,974,233 comparing with $5,570,684 for May 1908 and $4,035,245 for the period in 1907. The liabilities of all failed concerns, however, as stated above,and for the reasons enumerated, were greater in the month this year than in 1908 or 1907, the contrast being between $14,383,750 and $13,643,381 and $9,965,410. The suspension of the Waterville (Me.) Trust Co. with obligations of $1,500,000, and one small bank, comprised the disasters among banks in the month of 1909, whereas in May last year 20 finan4 cial institutions, with aggregate indebtedness of 51 millions of dollars, were forced to the wall. In 1907, however, one small bank comprised the insolvent list and only $10,000 was involved. A more satisfactory indicator of the comparative favorableness of the situation this year is furnished by the results for the elapsed five months of the calendar year. The total number of failures for that period in 1909 was only 5,868, representing $75,670,026 of indebtedness, whereas in the like period of 1908 the aggregates were 7,597 and $109,666,040. In 1907, however, the exhibit was much better than now, the number of failures having been only 4,772 and the liabilities $53,123,097. It is to be noted that the status of affairs in manufacturing lines is encouraging, $32,316,972 of indebtedness for the period this year comparing with $47,950,964 and $24,598,123 respectively in 1908 and 1907. A similar situation is to be recorded among traders,whose five months' aggregate of but $31,015,834 contrasts with $43,155,257 last year and $23,046,702 two years ago. Obligations of brokers, transporters, Scc., for the period since Jan. 1 total $12,337,220, against $18,559,819 in 1908 and only $5,478,272 in 1907. Financial casualties for the five months of 1909 involved obligations of $11,500,000, that aggregate comparing with $77,636,619 for the corresponding interval of 1908 and $9,629,028 in 1907. According to computations by the \"Insurance Press,\" a journal which pays particular attention to summaries of this nature, payments for death claims within this country and Canada by all life companies and associations in the United States were about % 3303 millions in 1908, to which an estimated 150 millions may be added for \"dividends\" and surrender values, plus payments to foreign policy-holders and to annuitants. These figures cover more than the work done by regular level-premium companies under the 1399 review of the official reports in this State, the total payments for death claims by these regular companies having been only 192% millions in 1907. These figures are impressive, and a business which disburses to its associated owners out of private funds a total of over 480 millions annually is vast enough to claim consideration. The advance of new life insurance business might halt, because of statutory restrictions or otherwise, without necessarily involving any decline in these disbursements; indeed, assets must be expected to grow, and payments to the insured naturally grow, by the nature of the case. It is therefore somewhat remarkable when this natural increase shows a halt. The past year was in some aspects one of no progress, and in some States official figures show_ a decline in death claims and endowments. The financial and industrial troubles certainly could not have tended to reduce mortality among holders of policies; yet we should not be warranted in putting all adverse results in life insurance upon either those troubles or upon bad legislation. These are the chief causes, but their respective shares can only be estimated. The companies which make returns to this State reported at the end of 1906 an increase of some 273I millions in the amount of loans to policy-holders during that year; in 1907 there was a further increase of about 4 721 millions in these loans; in 1908 a further increase of about 553/ millions, bringing the total to a little over 362 millions outstanding. These loans are made upon the policies as security, and of course stand as liens, reducing the insurance protection by just so much. We may assume that this increase represents mainly the unfavorable condition of things in general. Almost immediately after the trouble in the autumn of 1907 came a large resort to these loans, because holders of policies which had been running some years suddenly realized that they possessed in them an asset available for borrowing at once, however stringent the loan market. Of late years some of the larger companies have organized regular arrangements for keeping more in touch with their members; this includes systematic effort to dissuade from lapses and to keep policies alive by temporary aid. Special effort has been made to follow up policy loans and get the borrowers to pay them off; yet the loans have increased notwithstanding, and so far we see the effects of general trouble. But the official returns to this State show that about 1,124 millions of outstanding insurance ceased in 1908 in other modes than by death and maturity; that is, by expiration,surrender,lapse or decrease. These are unfavorable and undesirable modes of termination; they always indicate more or less unhealthiness in life insurance conditions,and used to be charged mainly to excessive competition. The amount thus ceased in 1908 was about 613 millions more than in 1907. Here are hidden the effects of adverse legislation and of the disturbance caused by the investigation of 1905, which lasted publicly for at least six months. How far the indiscriminate headlines and comments during the inquiry produced distrust and anger, and caused men to drop their policies,can never be exactly known, for no record of it has been made. But particular cases have been reported, as in one where a man persistently refused to pay his renewal, although the effort from the company to persuade him to do it was pushed 1400 THE CHRONICLE to the limit; then he suddenly died, and his widow pathetically explained her condition and inquired whether the company could not do something. Where a few cases have come to light it is safe to assume that many have occurred and the loss has been borne in silence. But it would not be extravagant to conclude that all which has ever been unjustly taken from the insured, by all the means discussed and denounced in 1905 and legislated against in 1906, i s far less than has been since lost through existing insurance sacrificed or natural insurance prevented as the result of this particular exercise of the desire to reform things too sweepingly and suddenly. VOL. the month of 1908 was a loss of 10,501. For the four months of 1909 the net increase was 345,389, against a decrease last year of 58,067. For the ten months of 1908-09 the arrivals (alien and non-alien) exceeded the departures by 405,554, against a similar balance of only 242,251 in 1907-08. For the month and four months of 1907,and the ten months of 1906-07,the net gains in foreign-born population were 140,626, 360,628 and 782,904 respectively. As regards the month just closed(May) immigration was hardly upon as free a scale as in April. According to figures compiled by us for the full period the arrivals of steerage passengers at New York were only 89,772, against 96,598 for April. In May of 1908, however, the inflow of aliens through all ports of the country reached the meagre total of 48,245 and the departures were 61,251, so that a further net loss of 13,006 in population resulted. This year, on the other hand, the outward movement continues small, so that the month will show an important net gain. The immigration statement for April, made public last week, presents no features differing so essentially from those for earlier months of 1909 as to call for extended comment. It shows, as did those months, a comphratively free movement of aliens to the United States, and, concurrently, there has been a small efflux of the same class from the country. In that respect the movement is in sharp contrast with that of a year ago, The Pennsylvania Railroad returns of earnings are when departures were in excess of the arrivals. The now showing larger increases with each succeeding reasons for the difference were fully explained by us month, just as in 1908 (with which we are comparing) when reviewing the statements for March and preced- they had been recording steadily augmenting losses. ing months of 1909.

Day-to-day money, representing bank and trust company balances, loaned on the Stock Exchange during the week at 2% and at 13%, averaging about 19%; all lending institutions quoted 13% as the minimum. Time loans were in only moderate request and offerings were not pressed. Round amounts of franc finance bills were drawn but few sterling loan drafts made their appearance. Rates for time contracts on good mixed Stock Exchange collateral were 2@231% for sixty and 2% for ninety days, 2@ j 23 4% for four, 3@33-1% for five to six and 33/2@3%% for over-the-year maturities.

According to our special cable from Lon7 don, the Bank of England lost £840,840 bullion during the week and held £37,302,530 at the close of the week. Our correspondent further advises us that the loss was due largely to shipments to the interior of Great Britain, but exports exceeded imports by £165,000. The details of the movement into and out of the Bank were as follows: Imports, .£95,000 (of which £10,000 from Hong Kong, £13,000 from miscellaneous sources and £72,000 bought in the open market); exports, £260,000 (of which £252,000 to South America and £8,000 to Gibraltar), and shipments of £676,000 net to the interior of Great Britain. ..... The foreign exchange market was remarkably strong this week, promptly absorbing the reimbursing bills drawn against exports of gold to Argentina and to Paris, and rates rose to about the highest recorded in a year; the business was chiefly confined to short Expectations that exchange would be immediately influenced as the result of the successful negotiations for the listing of Steel stocks on the Paris Bourse were not realized. Such listing, of itself, would not, it was asserted, create exchange, for the listed stock is to be represented, according to official reports, by the certificates of a syndicate that are issued against Steel stock which is held by such syndicate in trust, and these certificates will be traded in on the Bourse. The supply of sterling for remittance was slightly augmented through drafts against a shipment of PA millions gold to Argentina and on Wednesday the export of $885,000 gold to Paris created an equal amount of French exchange. These offerings of sterling and franc bills made only a temporary impression upon the market. Long sterling and franc drafts, representing borrowing of foreign capital through 1401 finance bills, contributed to an easier tone for these kinds of exchanges. Canadian bankers drew sixtyday bills at 4 8640 and ninety day at 4 8580, incident to such financing operations; extensions of these contracts for another period of three months would made the proceeds of the long drafts available for six months' loans at 3%@31 4%, the ruling rate for / domestic money. The market was quite strong on Thursday and it so continued on Friday. Compared with Friday of last week rates for exchange on Tuesday were 15 points lower for long at 4 8630@4 8635; 5 points higher for short at 4 8785® 4 8790, and 5 points for cables at 4 8805@4 8815. On Wednesday long and cables were unchanged and short rose 5 points to 4 8780@4 8795. On Thursday long was 15 points lower at 4 8625@4 8630, on a rise in unofficial discounts at London; short was 5 points higher at 4 8785@4 8795, and cables 5 points at 4 8810®4 8820.

The most noteworthy phenomenon of the clay, not only in our own but in the foreign markets, is undoubtedly the sudden outburst of speculation for the rise. It has taken different forms in different markets, and different explanations have been assigned to it abroad and here. In London, it has displayed itself in a violent advance in the market for South African gold mine shares, and a highly interesting incident in connection therewith is the recent turn of Paris capital on a very considerable scale into the speculation in these shares. Economies in mining and a consequent larger yield on the gold mine shares is the popular explanation. At London, it appears from all the dispatches that the Stock Exchange has witnessed an outburst of speculative activity of a violence not seen in that market, in the Kaffir shares at any rate, since the famous \"Barnato boom\" of 1895. In our own market we have had the rather striking spectacle of prices, after lying dormant during fully a month at the end of the winter season, suddenly turning into an upward movement, which, although irregularly distributed, has sufficiently demonstrated the presence of an appetite for speculation. Such a phenomenon brings a number of other considerations into view. To many 'people the fact of such a speculative movement, only a year and a half after the panic of 1907, is itself the greatest matter of surprise. But it is not by any means wholly without precedent. The London \"boom\" of 1895, just referred to, came at a similar distance from our panic of 1893, and not only was speculation rampant in London at that time, but our own markets went through a season of active speculation, partly a reflex of the London situation and partly a response to the apparently successful efforts to protect our Treasury's gold reserve. Beyond even this matter of precedent, however, it must always be kept in mind,in discussing the question as to recovery from 1907, in finance and in industry, that in two important respects the fundamental situation, when our markets emerged from the panic, was such as had never existed on any previous occasion of the kind. We refer to the familiar facts that the currency was sound, as it certainly was not after the panics of 1893 and 1873, and that the agricultural West, instead of being, as it was on those previous occasions, in a condition of depression and financial helplessness, was wealthy and prosperous to a degree never before witnessed in the history of the country. It was literally true that, whereas the West had been a burden on the financial resources of the East for years after our earlier panics, it was, in a certain sense, the mainstay of the whole country's position after the panic of 1907. The importance of this consideration has not diminished during the past eighteen months. It is, we believe, very largely to these two facts that some striking and apparently surprising phenomena of recent months must be ascribed. First of all, there was the undoubted spirit of confidence and optimism which prevailed, in the mind of the public at large, within a very few months after the panic itself. It assumed, no doubt, some slightly grotesque forms, and it was difficult for many people to take altogether seriously the \"prosperity leagues\" and the \"sunshine movement.\" Yet, at the same time, [Vora. Lxxxvin as the year 1908 drew on, it became evident that real conditions were mending with unexpected rapidity. It was noticeable, also, that whereas in all other panics the market for real estate and the building industry had been the last to collapse,and had suffered longest of all, it was in these very markets that activity seemed on this occasion to be most promptly resumed. Indeed, it is probably true that the interruption to, activity in real estate was more temporary than in any other market. This was largely true even of prices, taking the country as a whole, but it was even more notably true of volume of transactions. Stagnation in the realty market for a series of years has not been unusual at such junctures; but in 1908, where building permits taken out in the principal American cities footed up in January only $27,970,617, as against $46,136,314 in the same month of 1907, by September they had parallelled the total of the year before, and in December stood at $52,470,754, which not only far surpassed the $29,849,650 of the previous December, but ran beyond even the earlier active months of 1907. This was a striking illustration of the difference in conditions as compared with most previous occasions of the sort. It was not the only novel and curious phenomenon. One of the portentous incidents of the six months following the panic was the extraordinary emigration movement, which in some months of 1908 resulted in an exodus of laborers actually greater than the inflow. Yet the movement turned with such violence toward the cloSe of 1908 that immigrant arrivals during the past few months have been fully up to the normal of good times. Such things are sufficiently distinct evidence that the country was, at all events, not headed for such a period of depression and despondency as followed our other financial crises. Much doubt remained, and still remains in some directions, as to the exact nature of the situation. The position in the steel trade early in the present year was extremely perplexing and disconcerting. The reduction in prices which was eventually ordered led to great confusion and unsettlement during many weeks, but even this was followed, as were the similar cuts in the textile industries last year, by exceptionally large orders, hurried in to take advantage of the inviting prices. It would be premature to assume that this sudden demand has struck a pace which is sure to be maintained continuously. But it added necessarily to the optimism of the day. The stock market has drawn its own inferences from these various phenomena, as it usually does. How far its advancing prices have reflected relief from the absence of the complete demoralization in the steel market which may have been expected, how far it has indefinitely discounted the longer future, how far it is prudently measuring reasonable probabilities, and how far it has passed under the spell of unreasoning speculative excitement, are matters which are not always easy to determine. There is undoubtedly much in the argument that the people at large who hold stocks have apparently been reluctant to sell, even at the higher prices, and that this, as usual, has provided the opportunity for advancing the level of prices still higher. In a larger sense,the stock market has a traditional value as the index to coming events. There are, JUNE 5 1909.) THE CHRONICLE however, certain dangers in assigning this function to a speculative market, arising chiefly from the familiar habit of over-discounting. A speculative market may look to the immediate or the very much longer future, but in looking to the more distant outcome, it runs the risk .of overlooking what may happen before its hopes are realized. This was notably the case in the year already refered to, 1895. The Stock Exchange ievival of that year may be classed with perfect safety as the forecast of the reviving prosperity which began in 1897 and which assumed such extraordinary proportions later on. But before such expectations were by any means fulfilled there were some troublesome bridges to pass over, and the crossing caused for a considerable time a different aspect of things on the Stock Exchange and elsewhere. There is always the more or less doubtful question of the money market, as we learned in the autumn of 1901; there is the question of the crops, as we have learned on numerous occasions. It does not follow that either of these considerations will play an essential part in cheating hopeful expectations on the present occasion. Both may conceivably serve to encourage real confidence later on. But persons who wish to penetrate the future, if they are wise, will ,take the unpleasant possibilities into as full account as the pleasant. In the meantime, the testimony of present-day indications, not excepting the stock market, in pointing to a return of better times, is gratifying to every one. It is additional witness to the great change in the fundamental elements of financial strength, recuperative power and genuine prosperity which has come to the United States during the dozen past years. TOO MUCH LEGISLATION HARMFUL. Three prominent railroad men, talking this week on widely different subjects, have given expression to a common conclusion, namely, that in this country we are attempting too much .by legislation, and that interference on the part of Government with the everyday affairs of men is pernicious and harmful and at the same time destructive of that confidence and stability which are essential to uninterrupted progress. Mr. E. H. Harriman discoursed freely on a variety of topics on the eve of his departure for Europe; Mr. James J. Hill delivered an elaborate address on the opening of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition at Seattle, and President Charles S. Mellen of the New York New Haven & Hartford Railroad wrote a letter to the Public Utilities Committee of the Connecticut Legislature protesting against the bill proposing to establish in Connecticut a Public Service Commission. Added importance is given to the views of , these men by the fact that in politics their party affiliations are widely different. When, therefore, all three point to the dangers arising from attempting too much by statute, it is obvious that the warning should be heeded. Mr. Hill made the matter a leading feature of his speech. He declared that the greatest service to the nation, to every State and city, to-day, would be the substitution for a term of years of law enforcement for law-making. He thought the watch words of the republic ought to ,be \"Equality, Simplicity, Economy and Justice.\" He said they were interwoven with 1403 every fibre of the national fabric. To forget or deny them will lead to every misfortune and every possibility of destruction that rises now threateningly in the path of our country's greatness. Equality before the law, he argued, is an embodied promise of the United States. It is the first principle sought to be established by the Federal Constitution. In so far as we have been faithful to it, we have not only grown great and prosperous, but have commanded the respect of others because we respected ourselves. Continuing, he said: \"It needs heroism, it involves the shaking off of ostentatious follies that have already warped our earlier ideals, it may even require a considerable readjustment of our whole industrial system and a reform in our very conception of the relation between a government and its citizens, before the severe standard of absolute equality before the law can be restored. It demands a new standard of economy in both our public and private expenditure. \"It demands the repeal of many laws and the suppression of many of the bills presented to State and Federal legislatures—so many are there framed to give to one an undue advantage or take away from another fair field and an equal judgment. It demands the abolition of that most hateful and corroding element in a republic that is called class consciousness. To steer the ship of state among these shifting and conflicting currents, now full speed ahead and now full peed astern, is a •task of extraordinary difficulty. Yet, unless we can follow the course of equal justice laid down on the chart, shipwreck lies somewhere ahead.\" Mr. Hill also urged that the frequent use of the phrase \"our complex civilization\" creates a vague impression that simplicity has been banished necessarily from the modern world by a kind of natural evolution, whereas it remains now, as always, the normal rule of a wholesome national life. We have complicated our educational system and made it superficial. We have complicated our social life until natural human intercourse is overlaid with a, thick stratum of vulgar prodigality, luxury, display and insincerity. We have complicated our law-making until, despite the high standards, the unimpaired traditions and the continual labors of the courts, the administration of justice is difficult and sometimes uncertain. We have complicated our financial system until it encourages the wildest speculation at one moment and at another sinks into business collapse. We have complicated our industrial organization at both ends of the scale until the great middle class, which represents labor uncombined, a fine energy and modest accumulations of capital, finds many of its rights invaded or destroyed. And we complicate all these complications by incessantly passing more laws about them. He argued that simplicity in governing methods, in character and conduct must be a fixed quality of the State that survives those changes of the centuries in which all others have vanished. Mr. Harriman made no set remarks, but expressed himself without reserve on all the topics broached by the newspaper representatives who had called upon him to get his opinions on a variety of current matters. He gave utterance to much the same views with reference to the causes of the recent panic that have been frequently set out in these columns. He repudiated the idea that speculation should be held responsible for that calamity. \"It wasn't speculation and highpressure business which led up to the panic,\" he 1404 THE CHRONICLE said, \"but uneasiness caused by the attitude of the public officials.\" \"The panic of 1907 was directly caused by the extraordinary court decision of Judge Landis—there is no doubt about that. There was some distrust that hadn't been recovered from, caused by the reaction of the spring months, but it wasn't until the Landis decision came along that it became serious. That decision is what frightened people into withdrawing money from circulation.\" Mr. Harriman finds what others have noticed,that there is now a tendency on the part of the public to take a saner attitude toward corporations. He said that on his recent trip to the Pacific he found that conservatism was rapidly taking the place•of the hysteria of the last few years. \"People are beginning to get back their courage. They have been submerged in hysteria. They didn't know whom to trust and kept everybody under suspicion. Now, I think people are returning to the old-fashioned idea that they can have some confidence in the other fellow. Suspicions are narrow, and it is courage and confidence that make for progress.\" Mr. Mellen's comments, as already indicated, were prompted by a desire to oppose the establishment of a Public Service Commission, but what he had to say is of general application and wide interest. After noting that the chief power over the New Haven Co. conferred by the proposed bill is control by a political board over the management of its finances, he declared that this seemed to him unwise and injurious. He did not assume that there would be any toward his company on the part of any political board that might be created; for it was difficult to believe that any men would consciously wish to hamper the financial arrangements of the largest business corporation in New England, whose prosperity is evidently essential to the welfare of the communities which it serves. But assuming the most perfect good will toward the company by every member of the contemplated commission, the working of the proposed machinery of financial control would inevitably act injuriously upon the company's finances. In the first place, the mere fact that all the company's plans would have to be prematurely revealed to the world in a public hearing, at which the officials would be obliged to state precisely the purposes for which it was intended to raise new capital, might seriously hamper or even altogether prevent the execution of these plans. In the second place, the bill provides that the proposed political board shall dictate to the directors of the company the prices which they must receive for the company's securities. The communities served by the company are steadily growing in population and in the magnitude of their commerce. It is inevitable that the company will in the future, as in the past, have to add largely to its facilities in order to handle economically and expeditiously the increasing traffic on its lines. For this purpose it will require new capital in large amounts, but $20,000,000 or $30,000,000 of new capital cannot ba obtained in the same way or on the same terms that a few thousands can. The financial managers of the company need a free hand in the preparation of their financial plans, and in the delicate negotiations with bankers whose intermediation is often required. Under the proposed law there could be no certain basis for financial negotiations until aftor a public hearing and a [VOL. Lxxxvm decision by the proposed political board, which decision might be delayed for months. Moreover, the board may fix the price of the securities too high, in which case the financial plan will fail, with much resulting mischief; or the board may fix the price too low, in which case the bankers will not offer so much as they would have done if negotiations had been unhampered. Mr. Mellen also objects to the provision of the bill fixing an artificial limitation on the borrowing power of the corporation. This, he demonstrates, would operate unfairly and mischievously. It would seem, he says, that it ought to be the common desire in Connecticut to enable the company to borrow at home and abroad, upon' the best terms possible, all the money which its directors think can be safely borrowed and profitably used in the development of its business. But the proposed bill provides that the company can not issue bonds in excess of the amount of its nominal capital stock. Mr. Mellen shows how this would work in the case of the New Haven. In normal times the market value of New Haven stock, he urges, has been about $200 a share. A careful appraisal of its property indicates that the value of this property,over and above all liabilities, is sufficient to justify such a value for the stock. But the provision referred to would forbid the company to issue bonds for more than one-third of the actual value of the property. That is, if the company's capital is assumed to be $100,000,000, its bonds could not exceed $100,000,000. As the property represented by the stock is worth $200,000,000 and that represented by the bonds would be worth $100,000,000, the whole value of the property would be $300,000,000, against which the law would allow the issue of only $100,000,000 in bonds. Mr. Mellen also avers that the proposed law will financially injure weak corporations as well as those financially strong. Referring to the assumption that there should be public interference with the methods of raising new capital because the public is somehow harmed if the nominal capital of a company is greater than it need be, he shows that this assumption embodies an economic fallacy. A manufacturing corporation earning $100,000 per annum on a capital of $100,000, would earn no more if its nominal capital were $1,000,000 or $10,000,000. The sole:difference would be that in the latter case its dividends would only be 1% on the $10,000,000, as against the 100% on the original $100,000 of stock. However, this particular point has no bearing on the New Haven Co., which Mr. Mellen says cannot be intelligently accused of having any \"watered\" stock. It has never issued any stock since it was organized in 1872 at less than 100 cents on the dollar; but, on the other hand, it has during that time received in premiums on stock issued $22,808,537. Accordingly, he urges, that a statute ought not to be passed injuriously affecting the financial future of this great Connecticut company, because it is thought (whether intelligently or not) that some other company has in the past followed unsound principles of finance. Generalizing, Mr. Mellen says, it is easy to declaim about the existence of evils and to demand that they be immediately cured by statute. But when such a declaimer drafts his statute, it often appears that this statute would cause, in direct or indirect ways, evils in other respects which would outweigh any good expected from the law. It used to be better understood JUNE 5 1909.] THE CHRONICLE than it is now, he argues, that there are comparatively few evils that can advantageously be attacked by the statute law,and that on the whole that country is governed the best which is governed the least. Mr. Mellen is here expressing sound and sensible doctrine and his letter should serve to defeat the proposed measure or at least to secure its modification so that it will be shorn of its most objectionable features. Moreover, what he says, taken in conjunction with the views expressed by Messrs. Harriman and Hill, ought to have the effect of enlightening public sentiment so that there will be less interference with natural forces in promoting the development of the country's industries than there has been in the immediate past. FEDERAL TAXES ON INHERITANCES. While the inheritance tax proposal is not contained in the Aldrich Tariff Bill now under discussion in the Senate, the final attitude of Congress on the question cannot be definitely known until the actual conclusion of tariff legislation. Provision for a tax of that kind is embodied in the Payne Bill as it passed the House of Representatives, and President Taft also advocated such a tax in his inaugural address. The States, not unnaturally, are opposing the proposal, and it is obnoxious and objectionable on many grounds. Twice has the Federal Government, under the spur of necessity brought about by the extraordinary expenditures of war, resorted to the experiment of levying taxes upon inheritances, and, unlike the tax upon incomes, the legality of this form of taxation has received the sanction of the Supreme Court of the United States. The tax upon legacies and successions imposed on account of the Civil War took effect on June 30 1862 and its repeal became effective on Oct. 1 1870. The second resort to this sort of taxation was a part of the general scheme for meeting the cost of the Spanish War and was applied, subject to certain exemptions, to the personal estates of persons dying between June 13 1898 and July 1 1901, so far as the interests in such estates became absolutely vested in the possession and enjoyment of beneficiaries not especially exempted prior to the repeal of the law, which repeal took effect on July 1 1902. At least this statement of its scope is in accordance with the conclusions so far reached by the courts, with perhaps a single exception, in cases in which their aid has been invoked for its interpretation. Legacies or distributive shares passing to the husband or wife of the decedent were exempt from taxation, as were also bequests for educational, literary, artistic, religious and charitable purposes,and all interests not in excess of $10,000, to whomsoever passing. The rates of taxation were progressive in a double sense, the minimum rate of three-quarters of 1% being imposed upon interests of not over $25,000 which passed to lineal issue or ancestors or to brothers or sisters of the decedent. The rate doubled if the taxable interest passed to the descendant of a brother or sister, and quadrupled if to an uncle or aunt or one taking as the descendant of either. Four per cent was exacted on interests passing to great-uncles or great-aunts or their descendants and 5% on those to more remote collaterals, to strangers in: blood or to bodies politic or corporate. Whatever the degree of relationship the rate increased 50% if the interest 1405 exceeded $25,000 and did not exceed $100,000; 100% if from $100,000 to $500,000; 150% if from $500,000 to $1,000,000 and 200% if it exceeded $1,000,000. Thus the maximum rate. under the law became 15% and this rate was applicable to an interest exceeding $1,000,000 when such interest passed to a relative more remote than a second cousin. In a recent case the Supreme Court held that the highest rate was properly exacted upon an interest passing to a legallyadopted daughter of the decedent. The collections under this law naturally continued, owing to delays in the settlement of estates, for some time after its repeal, the amounts received by years being as follows: Years ending June 30— 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 Amts. Collected $1,235,435 2 2,884 ,491 5,211,898 4,842.966 5,356,774 2 072 132 774,354 142,148 Total $22,520.201 1: Amounts collected subsequent to June 30 1906 would doubtless slightly increase the aggregate shown but not in a material degree. The amounts refunded as improperly exacted are not definitely known, but it is probable that in the aggregate they somewhat exceed 10% of the collections and that therefore the total sum remaining to the Government to the credit of this tax is less than 20 millions. The geographical distribution or incidence of this tax is interesting and significant. As might have been expected, it fell most heavily upon the northeastern portion of the United States, but few would apprehend, without an examination of the data, how largely this was the case. The collections were not reported separately by collection districts after July 1 1902, but for the first four fiscal years during which they were made such data are available. The following table, for the years 1899 to 1902, inclusive, during which the collections aggregated $14,174,792, shows the amounts collected in Eastern and Northeastern States. Per Cent PerCent Amounts of Total of Total Collected. Concerns. Pop'n.

Massachusetts paid $142 of each $1,000 collected, though it has but 37 of each 1,000 of the country's population. The average payment per 1,000 of population for New York was $684 22; for Massachusetts, $720 63; for the whole region covered by the States specifically enumerated in the foregoing table, $597 27. For the rest of the United States the average payment per 1,000 of population was $76 35. Such an inequitable distribution of the burden of any tax among the people of the United States plainly violates the spirit if not the letter of the Constitutional requirement that direct taxes shall be apportioned among the States in proportion to their population. It is especially obnoxious when the injustice is so sectional in its operation. The result is one which might temporarily be borne as an incident of war, but it ought to forbid the permanent adoption of taxes on inheritances as a source of Federal revenue. 1406 The ready answer to this objection, viz.,that the tax is placed where it can most easily be borne, is neither sufficient nor in accordance with the facts. As the tax contemplated must be confined to personal property in order to meet the Constitutional objections to a direct tax not apportioned in accordance with population, it is not a tax upon property or wealth but upon a particular form of property. The preponderating portions of the total exactions which were collected in New York, Massachusetts and the other States specifically named do not indicate that these States possess proportionate shares of the national wealth; they only mean that the property of the people of those States is more generally in a particular form, that of personalty, than that of the inhabitants of other portions of the country. It should be observed that these objections are quite aside from any considerations affecting the propriety of this form of taxation as a source of revenue for particular States. Proposals of the latter sort are to be accepted or rejected upon quite different grounds, and it is worth remembering in this connection that most American students of taxation, who approve these taxes at all, are of the opinion that legacies and successions should be reserved for State taxation or as the subjects of especial and temporary emergency taxes necessarily levied by the Federal Government. are in large measure only a shifting from one product to the other, as the exigencies of the case may be, most cultivable land being already utilized in one way or another. Thus it happens that with provisions high corn will be substituted for cotton, as has been done to some extent this season. But when we get into newer territory we find each year a tendency—and a natural one at that—to add to the area under cotton. Still even there the additions from year to year will vary much in ratio, and in some cases an actual reduction occurs. We have to go no further back than the spring of 1905 for an instance of that kind. From the largely increased planting the previous year, favorable weather conditions assisting, an unprecedented crop was secured—a yield nearly 33/ million bales greater than in the previous season. As a result the world's surplus stock of cotton was very appreciably augmented and a marked decline in prices was the outcome, values at time of planting in 1905 being the lowest in six years. While the excessive supply may not alone have been effective, it, in conjunction with low prices, was instrumental in bringing about a general diminution in area —noticeable in every cotton-growing State—that completely wiped out the previous year's addition. Again, some comparatively local cause, such as a late flood, will operate to hold down or take away from cotton acreage. But in the long run in newer fields, such as Texas, Oklahoma and to some extent Arkansas, considerable virgin soil is brought into cultivable condition each year, and under any but extraordinary. circumstances cotton gets some of it, and very often the major portion. So far as the present season is concerned, there has been no apparent reason for cutting down cotton acreage, but a number of factors working to induce an increase. The most potent of these has been the comparatively high prices ruling for the current crop, despite the fact that the ultimate yield bids fair to approximate very close to, if not e)eceed, the record production of 1904-05. Again, notwithstanding the large yield,surplus stocks of the raw material have not become excessive, considering the rate at which consumption of cotton is increasing. It is only a few years.ago that the carrying forward from one season to another of a surplus of a million bales or so would have had a marked effect on price bases. Now a carry-over of any amount is merely taken as a guaranty of sufficiency of supplies in time of need—crop disaster; and a large acreage does not assure a corresponding crop. On that point it hardly seems necessary to enlarge, so many instances in support of it being comparatively fresh in the minds of those who follow cotton matters closely. Lest, however, there should be any doubt on this point, we repeat the compilation we gave last year showing the variations in yield for a number of years past: Year's Planting. . • Census Bureau total. . on.,200 1.0NceCOO....1M-1 10.:01 00 .4 ,-4, , No000c0CD000000000000000 =CD CD ice 00GO GO oZo0o0o0c0c0c0C0 CA C7, . CLI C. l COTTON ACREAGE AND CONDITION JUNE 1909. Our investigations into this spring's cotton planting have not unearthed any evidence of the wholesale reduction in area planted that early disseminated reports claimed would be a feature of the season. Changes in acreage have occurred, of course, and some of them have been in the direction of curtailment of planting; but on the whole there has been the usual non-attention to the freely offered advice to decrease cultivation. It is passing strange that each spring for some years past there have been the same rumors circulated about intentions to largely reduce area, emanating apparently from practically the same sources; but the reduction never materializes. The reports are always received with incredulity, but they continue from year to year, their disseminators failing to grasp the humor of the situation. The question naturally arises: Why should there be any general reduction in area with the world's need for cotton quite steadily increasing and the crop a profitable one in the raising? Usually one of the arguments advanced in favor of reducing acreage is the alleged lack of profit. It is undoubtedly true that in some sections of the South there are crops that, all things considered, make a better return at times than cotton; but, speaking generally of the results of recent years, the staple has been the best paying crop. Cost of production has increased of late years in most sections, but prices secured for the product have advanced in much greater ratio. Back in the nineties, with cotton selling at times but little above 5 cents for middling uplands at New York, lack of profit or actual loss at the plantation was a reasonable assumption. But the last four seasons, with middling here ruling above 9 cents all the time, and above 10 cents during most of the marketing period, claims of unprofitableness lack force. This is amply proven by the planter's attitude regarding area. In the older sections of the belt, and more particuarly in the Atlantic States, any changes in the area of crops [VoL. Lxxxvm.

Normal conditions assured, the greater the area the larger would be the total yield. But while acreage is controllable, weather is not. In the series of years covered by the table the average yield per acre has varied all the way from 144 lbs. lint per acre (1884 planting) to 240 lbs. (1898), with the production exceeding 200 lbs. in only six out of the twenty seasons given. In the season drawing to a close the crop is of course, as already stated, close to, if not in excess of, the previous record in number of bales, but in product per acre is only of average proportion in fact, the average of the other nineteen years. On the acreage as given a yield per acre as great as in 1899 would have afforded a yield over 16 million bales; but on the basis of the 1884 production per acre the outturn would have been barely 10 million bales. This indicates the possible variations that may result from weather conditions, and denotes the folly of making any crop estimates based mainly upon acreage figures. We have attempted to enumerate above some of . the considerations which in one way or another influence planters in the matter of acreage; and with them in mind we fail to discern any reason why any reductions in area should have been looked for this year, except such as have been induced by locally operating causes. Prices have been remunerative recently, the world's needs are increasing and labor is plentiful. With those favorable factors working in unison it is not reasonable to expect that Southern planters would generally curtail cotton area for some other product. We note with a certain amount of satisfaction, as it tends to confirm our estimate of total acreage issued In June last, that the Department of Agriculture has revised its acreage- figures for 1908. It announces that as a result of a special investigation a revision of its preliminary estimate of the area planted to cotton last year has been made, the revision indicating that the acreage then seeded was about 33,370,000 acres, instead of 32,081,000 acres as estimated last June. This brings the Government total for last year practically in accord with ours, which was 33,512,112 acres. This is the second time within the last few years that the Department has been forced to take such action. The former occasion, however, a much greater addition had to be made, as after stating in June 1906 that \"the Department is convinced that the estimated planted acreage in cotton of about 28,686,000 acres is near the truth,\" it made revision the following June, increasing the 1906 area to 32,049,000 acres, or a little in excess of our result. There is no intention in referring to this matter to reflect in any way upon those who have charge of the compilation of the estimates for the Department; but the fact that such important corrections have had to be made rather indicate that the sources of information are not of the best. As regards our own compilations of area, we have never been dogmatic enough to assert that the results are absolutely correct, but do claim that they indicate the tendency as closely as it can be arrived at short of an actual census. Consequently we should be permitted to entertain a feeling of satisfaction at their virtual confirmation at this time. 1407 Conclusions. From the details by States given on subsequent pages, we sum up our conclusions briefly as follows: FIRST, Acreage. -As already inferred, there has not been any general tendency this spring toward radicalism in either direction in the matter of cotton area, and certainly our investigations have unearthed no evidence that advice to reduce it largely has been heeded. Locally operating causes have been effective in the direction of curtailment; but, generally speaking, conservatism has been the rule, and on the average for the whole country the result has been a small increase in area. In this respect the season has differed little from that which preceded it. Comparatively high prices for grain have induced planters in some States, if not in all, to substitute cereals for cotton, with the result that in a number of instances new land given to \"cotton has barely offset that taken away or left but a nominal increase, and in others there has been an actual decrease, as in North Carolina and Mississippi. In Louisiana,of course,the situation has been very different, our reports indicating that fears of a boll-weevil invasion, more apparently on the part of those who make advances to farmers than of the planters themselves, has been instrumental in bringing about quite an important reduction in acreage. It is, in fact, only in newer sections (mainly of Texas and Oklahoma) that we find really large additions, and even there grain seems to have been substituted on some land heretofore given to cotton. At the same time, with prices remunerative, as they have been during the season now drawing to a close, there has been a pretty full planting of the staple, as, according to our analysis of the situation, there has been a net gain in the country's cotton acreage of 1.05%, against 1.31% last year. The changes, as we have made them for each State, are indicated in detail in the following: Es imated for 1909. States.

Low temperature and some flooding of bottom lands delayed planting; and cold weather during April.and the first few days of May, culminating in frosts from the 1st to the 3d of the latter month, retarded germination. Moreover, deficiency of moisture in portions of Texas all through the season down to about the middle of May was an adverse influence but during the last two or three weeks the weather has been more favorable, barring excess of rain in some localities, inducing satisfactory development of the plant and working a decided improvement in the outlook. In fact, telegraphic advices as we go to press denote that the crop is doing well as a whole. The prospect therefore is that with average seasons a fairly good crop will be secured. (2) Cultivation, according to our returns, has been well looked after, with the result that fields over much f the belt are now quite free of foreign vegetation, many, in fact, stating that the weather has favored work so much that they are cleaner than the average. Fertilizers have been more extensively used this year, the takings of both commercial sorts and home-made composts having increased. (3) Condition of the plant, as our summaries denote, is now in the main fairly promising, and, except that it is less advanced, is rather better than last year at this time. In Texas of course the droughty conditions that were so prominent a feature down to the middle of May caused a feeling of pessimism with regard to the outlook in that State, which, however, has been largely dispelled by the progress the crop has made under the influence of the recent rains. Speaking generally, the plant is now in good condition pretty much everywhere and on the whole quite well fortified to overcome any ordinary adverse conditions. The ultimate outturn, however, is a problem to be solved by the weather conditions during the next two or three months. Our summaries by States are as follows: VIRGINIA.—The preparation of land for cotton and the actual putting in of the seed in Virginia this season was about on a par with 1908. Our reports on germination indicate that seed came up fairly well on the whole, and that little or no replanting had to be done. Weather conditions since growth began have been favorable on the average, although there have been some complaints of too low temperature. Stands average good over the State and fields are in a satisfactory state of cultivation. Acreage.—The cotton area of Virginia is at best limited, and this season, while changes are noted in some localities, it remains practically the same as it was last year. Fertilizers have been used to about the same extent as in the previous season. NORTH CAROLINA.—On the average the planting season differed little from last year, work starting in some sections about the middle of April and finishing generally a month later. While the season in April this year was on the whole more satisfactory than in 1908, there were complaints that heavy rains rendered the soil crusty and hard to work in some localities, retarding operations to some extent. But this applied to a comparatively very limited area. With regard to germination, our, returns are quite full and pretty well in accord. They indicate that seed came up well in most instances. Cold weather was complained of at times as late as the first week in May, and in a few insta"
