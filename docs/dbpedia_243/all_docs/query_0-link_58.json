        "text": "This is a list of notable tornadoes, tornado outbreaks, and tornado outbreak sequences that have occurred in Canada in the 21st century (2001 through 2100). Due to increasing detection, particularly in the US and southern Canada, numbers of counted tornadoes have increased markedly in recent decades although number of actual tornadoes and counted significant tornadoes has not. In older events, the number of tornadoes officially counted is likely underestimated.\n\nOn average, there are around 80 confirmed and unconfirmed tornadoes that touch down in Canada each year, with most occurring in the southern Canadian Prairies, Southern Ontario and southern Quebec. Canada ranks second in the world for the most tornadoes per year, after the United States. The most common types are F0 to F2 in damage intensity level and usually result in minor structural damage to barns, wood fences, roof shingles, chimneys, uprooted or snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Fewer than 5% of tornadoes in Canada are rated F3 or higher in intensity, where wind speeds are in excess of 225 km/h (140 mph). Prior to April 1, 2013, Canada used a slightly modified Fujita scale, and as of that date the Enhanced Fujita scale, again slightly modified, was put into use to rate tornado intensity, based on the damage to buildings and vegetation.[1]\n\nEach year on average, about 43 tornadoes occur across the Canadian Prairies and about 17 occur across Ontario and Quebec.[2] New Brunswick and the British Columbia Interior are also recognized tornado zones. All other provinces and territories have significantly less threat from tornadoes. The peak season in Canada is through the summer months (June to August) when clashing air masses move north, as opposed to the spring season in the United States southern-central plains, although tornadoes in Canada have occurred in spring, fall and very rarely winter.\n\nThe reported increase in numbers of tornadoes in recent years may reflect more reporting by citizens and media involvement rather than an actual increase in tornado occurrence (although some natural increase has not been ruled out), in addition to better detection technology i.e. Doppler weather radar and satellite imagery. The upswing could also be attributed to other factors, such as improved aerial and ground damage assessment after the fact in sparsely populated areas (particularly the case in remote parts of the Canadian Prairies and Northern Ontario, for example), better trained spotter capabilities and increased use of digital recording devices by citizens. The Northern Tornadoes Project attempts to gather more systematic data on tornado prevalence.[3] Tornadoes in Canada are enough of a threat for a public warning system to be in place, overseen by the national weather agency, Environment Canada (EC).\n\nFor a variety of reasons, such as Canada's lower population density and generally stronger housing construction due to the colder climate, Canadian tornadoes have historically caused far fewer fatalities than tornadoes in the United States. The deadliest tornado in Canadian history, the Regina Cyclone of June 30, 1912, does not even rank in the top 25 when compared to American tornado fatalities. Urban centres are not immune from the threat of severe tornadoes. Twelve medium to large size Canadian cities have been hit by significant strength tornadoes (F3/EF3 or higher), which caused large-scale damage and fatalities: Toronto (1868); Regina (1912); Windsor (1946 and 1974); Sarnia (1953); LaSalle (1956); Sudbury (1970); Woodstock (1979); Lloydminster (1983); Barrie (1985); Edmonton (1987); Aylmer (1994 and 2018); and Ottawa-Gatineau (1888 and 2018).\n\nAll figures for damages are in Canadian dollars.\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\n2001\n\n[edit]\n\nJune 8 – an F0 tornado was confirmed near Upper Manitou Lake, about 45 km (28 mi) south of Dryden, Ontario, causing extensive tree damage.[4]\n\nJune 19 – two tornadoes touched down in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec.

The first near Burnstown, 10 km (6.2 mi) southeast of Renfrew. It ripped the roof off a barn, snapped several trees and destroyed a shed.[15] The second tornado happened near Thurso.\n\n2005\n\n[edit]\n\nMay 23 – a tornado touched down in and around Nipawin, Saskatchewan.\n\nJune 4 – several cold-core funnel clouds were spotted in Central and Southern Alberta. Four of which briefly touched the ground. Several trees were damaged.\n\nJune 21 – A severe thunderstorm spawned one tornado near Lethbridge, Alberta.

These associated storms caused extensive widespread damage in a path from Stratford (20 km (12 mi) west of Kitchener), to Peterborough, and along Georgian Bay near Collingwood. A storm cell just to the north of Fergus spawned two F2 strength tornadoes that were particularly damaging, tearing apart trees, farms and overturning automobiles driving on a highway. The first tornado tracked through Milverton to Conestogo Lake (west of Elmira). The second moved from Salem to Lake Bellwood (north of Guelph). The same storm cell later triggered a tornado warning in Toronto and caused extensive flooding with over 140 mm (5.5 in) of rain in some northern sections of the city, washing out many roads as well as damaging infrastructure such as storm sewers and electrical systems. An unusual tornado possibly touched down within the Toronto city limits, although never officially confirmed by Environment Canada. In its wake, the storm left a trail of damage that, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, represented the highest insured loss in the province's history, exceeding $500 million. That's more than two and a half times Ontario's losses during the infamous ice storm of 1998 and the second largest loss event in Canadian history.\n\nNovember 9 – A late-season F1 tornado touched down in Hamilton, Ontario, damaging homes and tearing the roof off an elementary school a school, injuring two students.[17]\n\n2006\n\n[edit]\n\nJuly 4 – an F1 tornado struck Glassville, New Brunswick, 40 km (25 mi) south of Perth Andover.

The same storm system spawned an outbreak of fourteen confirmed tornadoes[19] mostly concentrated north of Peterborough in the Haliburton, Kawartha and Madawaska areas, which damaged cottages in the area, some severely. It was the most tornadoes confirmed in Ontario in a single 24-hour span day since 1985 and matched the annual provincial average. The strongest were two F2s, one that struck an isolated area near Bancroft and the other that made a direct hit on the town of Combermere.\n\nAugust 5 – in Gull Lake, Manitoba an F2 tornado killed a woman at a campground north of Winnipeg.\n\nAugust 15 - an F1 tornado impacted the area of Pokemouche and Evangeline, New Brunswick. Hail, damaging winds and intense lightning were reported in the region. A tornado swept along a corridor of 20–50 m (66–164 ft) wide and 3 to 5 km (1.9 to 3.1 mi) long extending from Pokemouche through Evangeline. The tornado estimated in the lower F1 range (wind estimated around 120 km/h (75 mph)) caused structural damage to a few properties and uprooted/snapped a few trees along the corridor. The sighting of the actual funnel cloud / tornado was reported by a few members of the public. Ended at\n\nAugust 20 – two tornadoes touched down in Manitoba, including an F2 tornado that hit the community of La Broquerie, Manitoba, destroying a house. The second tornado touched down just east of the Stony Mountain Institution, approximately 15 km (9.3 mi) north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, whipping up dust in a farm field. Video on YouTube\n\nAugust 24 – two tornadoes touched down near Unity and Yorkton, Saskatchewan.\n\n2007\n\n[edit]\n\nMay 15 – An F1 tornado struck the Mitchell, Ontario, area around 60 km (37 mi) northeast of London, causing minor damage. It was the third significant tornado to hit the Mitchell area in a three-year span. The same storm system that caused this tornado also produced two other tornadoes (an F0 and an F1) in The Thumb area of Michigan, northern Indiana, and Ohio before crossing Lake Huron into Ontario.\n\nJune 22–23 – A rare combination of weather systems converged on a June weekend causing severe thunderstorms which spawned at least eight tornadoes across southeast Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. The most significant, and the first confirmed F5 tornado in Canada, touched down near Elie destroying four homes, sweeping away two (one of which was heavily anchored to its foundation), flipping one home-owner's Chrysler Fifth Avenue onto a neighbour's roof, and heavily damaging a flour mill. The F5 Elie tornado was described \"as bad as they ever get here in Canada\" by meteorologist Dave Carlsen of Environment Canada, while he told Canwest Global affiliate CKND-TV.[20][21] A large F3 wedge tornado also touched down near Pipestone and Baldur.[22] Two tornadoes at Lampman and Carnduff, Saskatchewan, reported property damage and one injury, Surprisingly there were a minimal amount of reported injuries resulting from all of the tornadoes. There were also sightings of three small tornadoes becoming one. One of the tornadoes in this outbreak also travelled 15 km (9.3 mi) south of Baldur and was rated an F3 on the Fujita scale.[23] A total of eight confirmed tornadoes over the two day span.\n\nJune 25 – a small tornado touches down near Standard, Alberta, destroying a barn and electrocuting a horse.\n\nJune 26 – Environment Canada confirmed a tornado struck the Petitcodiac, New Brunswick, in the Salisbury area.
