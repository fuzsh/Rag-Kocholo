The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe perceived humidity level in Yorkton, as measured by the percentage of time in which the humidity comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable, does not vary significantly over the course of the year, staying within 2% of 2% throughout.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Yorkton\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in YorktonJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Mar 120%Mar 120%Jul 195%Jul 195%NowNowcomfortablecomfortabledrydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Yorkton experiences mild seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe windier part of the year lasts for 8.3 months, from September 21 to May 30, with average wind speeds of more than 10.6 miles per hour.

Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy experiences extreme seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe brighter period of the year lasts for 3.7 months, from April 28 to August 17, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter above 5.7 kWh. The brightest month of the year in Yorkton is July, with an average of 6.7 kWh.\n\nThe darker period of the year lasts for 3.6 months, from October 25 to February 13, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter below 2.1 kWh.

Within 10 miles is essentially flat (154 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (945 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Yorkton is covered by cropland (53%) and artificial surfaces (43%), within 10 miles by cropland (85%) and grassland (11%), and within 50 miles by cropland (83%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Yorkton, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Yorkton.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Yorkton according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Yorkton is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Yorkton and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nYorkton Municipal Airport (CYQV, 96%, 3.3 mi, north, -16 ft elevation change)\n\nRoblin Man (CWXB, 1.8%, 48 mi, east, 121 ft elevation change)\n\nBroadview, Sask.

Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis .

While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
