        "text": "This report on climate change in Ontario provides: • a synthesis of the current climate change impacts being seen in Ontario; • a series of maps showing potential future climate across the province in the event international efforts to curb greenhouse gases are not successful at avoiding buildup of atmospheric CO2 concentrations to 450 ppm, resulting in a 4°C increase in global temperature; • current and projected CO2 emission in Ontario and other Canadian jurisdictions, set against a theoretical cap on emissions that would limit global temperature change to 2°C; and, • examples of opportunities for emissions reductions in Ontario, in particular in the forest and transportation sectors. Climate change maps are used to show where the relative hazard produced by climate change might be highest across the province, by combining changes in temperature and precipitation into a single numerical hazard index.\n\nA series of posters representing updated data and information about climate change science are displayed along the walkway on the first floor in Building F. These posters are collected, summarized and synthesized from peer-reviewed publications from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; UN Food and Agriculture Organization; U.S. Environmental Agency; U.S. Climate Change Science Program and U.S. National Research Council. The overall objective of the project is to increase the Governors State University community\\u27s awareness of the climate change issue and enhance the intellectual pursuits for better understanding of interaction between human activities and the environments\n\nI have slightly revised this paper to take into account some comments, as well as to remove a few typos.
