        "text": "City in Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nNot to be confused with Yorktown.\n\nFor other uses, see Yorkton (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nYorkton is a city located in south-eastern Saskatchewan, Canada. It is about 450 kilometres (280 mi) north-west of Winnipeg and 300 kilometres (190 mi) south-east of Saskatoon and is the sixth largest city in the province.\n\nYorkton was founded in 1882 and incorporated as a city in 1928. The city is bordered by the rural municipalities of Orkney to the north, west, and south, and Wallace on the east.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1882 a group of businessmen and investors formed the York Farmers Colonization Company. Authorized to issue up to $300,000 in debentures and lenient government credit terms on land purchases encouraged company representatives to visit the District of Assiniboia of the North-West Territories with the intent to view some crown land available near the Manitoba border. They were impressed with what they saw and the group purchased portions of six townships near the Little Whitesand River (now Yorkton Creek) for the purpose of settlement and to establish a centre for trade there.[8] This centre would become known as York Colony.[9]\n\nThe company founded the settlers' colony on the banks of the Little Whitesand River where lots were given freely to settlers who purchased land from them. The colony remained at its site until 1889. It was originally located at PT SE 1/4 13-26-4 W2M.[10]\n\nIn 1889 the rail line was extended to the Yorkton area. It was at this time the colony townsite relocated alongside the new rail line.[11]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nYorkton is located in the aspen parkland ecosystem.[12] The terrain is mainly one of agriculture and there is no forestry industry.[13] It is also in an area of black calcareous chernozemic soils.[12][13] The Yorkton area was located on the edge of an area of a maximum glacial lake.[13] The quaternary geology has left the area as a moraine plain consisting of glacial deposits.[12] The bedrock geology is the Pembina Member of Vermillion River Formation and Riding Mountain Formation. Yorkton is located in the physiographic region of the Quill Lake-Yorkton Plain region of the Saskatchewan Plains Region.[13]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nYorkton has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with extreme seasonal temperatures. It has warm summers and cold winters, with the average daily temperatures ranging from −17.9 °C (−0.2 °F) in January to 17.8 °C (64.0 °F) in July.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Yorkton was 40.6 °C (105 °F) on 19 July 1941.[14] The coldest temperature ever recorded was −46.1 °C (−51 °F) on 20 January 1943.[15]\n\nExtreme weather events\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the evening of July 1, 2010, Yorkton received a severe thunderstorm warning. Soon after, Yorkton was experiencing pea sized hail, strong winds, lightning, and heavy rain. The rain created a flash flood. Broadway Street received the worst of the flood with local businesses being severely damaged, with one being completely destroyed.[18] The city of Yorkton declared a State of Emergency and the Canadian Red Cross helped out with the victims of the flood.[19]\n\nOn the weekend of June 29, 2014, Yorkton declared a State of Emergency after rain caused flash floods in south-eastern Saskatchewan.[20]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationsYearPop.±%1901700— 19112,309+229.9%19215,151+123.1%19315,027−2.4%19415,586+11.1%19517,074+26.6%19619,995+41.3%197113,430+34.4%198115,339+14.2%199115,315−0.2%200115,107−1.4%200615,038−0.5%201115,669+4.2%201616,343+4.3%202116,280−0.4%Source: Statistics Canada[21][22]\n\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Yorkton had a population of 16,280 living in 6,974 of its 7,529 total private dwellings, a change of -0.4% from its 2016 population of 16,343.
