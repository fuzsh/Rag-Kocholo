        "text": "Rainfall\n\nNorthern Saskatchewan has received extremely high cumulative precipitation since April 1, 2020, resulting in very high flows and lake levels across the Churchill River and Lower Saskatchewan River basins. Much of this rainfall fell in the months of May, June, and July, where accumulations at some sites exceeded 200% of normal.\n\nOver this past week, most of the Churchill River Basin received 9 to 20 mm, with the heaviest rain occurring in the northeast in the Hatchet Lake area. Father north, over Lake Athabasca and in the Stony Rapids area, 27 to 45 mm of precipitation was received. These amounts are not expected to result in any higher peak flows or levels than what has already been observed.\n\nFlows and Lake Levels:\n\nHigh river and lake levels can be expected for the remainder of fall and in some cases, such as the mainstem of the Churchill River, into the winter. The observed peaks throughout the system were generally slightly lower than previous historical highs. However, flows and levels in the Lower Churchill River, including Reindeer River and Churchill River near Sandy Bay, exceed previous historical highs.\n\nBelow are specific conditions at various locations as well as projected future peak levels:\n\nIle a la Crosse:\n\nPresent elevation: 420.97m\n\nLevels at Lac Ile a la Crosse are continuing to decline; however, they will remain higher than normal for the remainder of the open water season and vulnerable to additional rainfall events and wind events. Based on historically similar years, levels prior to spring snowmelt in 2021 are expected to be 0.4-0.5 m higher than normal on Lac Ile a la Crosse.\n\nLac La Ronge:\n\nCurrent elevation: 364.84 m\n\nObserved Peak: 364.95 m (August 10-30)\n\nOver the past week, 9 mm of rainfall has been recorded at La Ronge and lesser amounts over headwater areas near Montreal Lake, and lake levels continue to decline. Lac La Ronge is still expected to go into winter at a level similar to what was experienced in 2011.\n\nSandy Bay\n\nPresent Elevation: 8.56 m (1830 m3/s)\n\nObserved peak: 10.15 m (2420 m3/s) on August 4\n\nWater levels at Sandy Bay reached a peak on August 4 and are now down about 1.6 m. Levels are now well below the 2005 peak. With flows upstream showing some slow declines, flows and levels at Sandy Bay will continue to decline slowly over the coming week. Flows are expected to drop below 1800 m3/s by the end of the month and continue to slowly recede in October.\n\nMeeting Lake\n\nWith warm and dry conditions over the past month, levels at Meeting Lake have been dropping. 25 mm of precipitation has been recorded since September 1.\n\nPresent elevation: 739.27 m – September 18, 2020\n\nObserved peak: 739.48 m – July 27, 2020\n\nFuture Rainfall\n\nMinimal precipitation is expected to fall over the next couple of days, with only 1 to 10 mm of precipitation expected across most of the north. A small precipitation event is expected to occur early next week, with the northeast corner of the province forecasted to receive an additional 15 mm.\n\nNorthern Saskatchewan has received extremely high cumulative precipitation since April 1, 2020, resulting in very high flows and lake levels across the Churchill River and Lower Saskatchewan River basins. Much of this rainfall fell in the months of May, June, and July, where accumulations at some sites exceeded 200% of normal.\n\nFor more information, contact\n\nPatrick Boyle\n\n(306) 631-6997"
