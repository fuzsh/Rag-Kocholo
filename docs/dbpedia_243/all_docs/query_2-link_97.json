Our perceived temperatures factor in humidity and wind chill to better represent how hot or cold the day feels to a person.\n\nAverage Yorkton Temperatures by Month\n\nDaily highs (averaged for the month) usually give the best indication of the weather.

Note that we define “significant precipitation” as .1 inches or more in this section. The lowest chance of rain or snow occurs around early to mid February.
