        "text": "It will be a wintery start to the week in Saskatchewan.\n\nAs of Sunday, snowfall warnings have been issued in the areas around Yorkton, Moosomin, Melfort, Humboldt, Kamsack, Hudson Bay and Pelican Narrows.\n\nDavid Baggaley, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said in an interview that those areas can expect the snow to hit hard and fast.\n\n“The biggest issue is that it’s going to snow heavily today. It’s going to come down pretty quickly. It will be a quick change to the weather, so travel in that part of the province … It’s probably going to be quite tricky today,” he explained.\n\nIn the northeast, he’s predicting 15 to 25 centimetres, or six to 10 inches of snow. In the southeast and central-east, he’s forecasting 10 to 15 centimetres, or four to six inches.\n\nThe heaviest snow will come from a weather system throughout Sunday. A second, less-severe system will hit more of the province late Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIn both Regina and Saskatoon, temperatures are well below normal and there are good chances of either rain or snow.\n\nIn Regina, the temperature is expected to fall to 1 C in the afternoon. The average daily high for this time of year is above 9 C.\n\nIn Saskatoon, the temperature will hold steady at about 2 C. The average daily high for this time of year is above 9 C.\n\n“It’s a little bit late in the season, (but) springtime is always the changeable season. Just about anything can happen, of course. We’re always hoping that we’d be done with winter by now, though,” Baggaley said."
