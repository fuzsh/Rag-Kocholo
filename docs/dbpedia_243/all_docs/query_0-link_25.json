Riggs Treas., NVIlliam Dana Seibert, See.. Herbert D.Seibert. Addresses of all. Office of Co. The Financial Situation. The text of the report of the committee of bankers, headed by Albert H. Wiggin of the Chase National Bank, which has been investigating the condition of German credits, has been made public the present week, and has everywhere been received with high praise. It is a clear cut statement of German conditions and German needs, frank as well as comprehensive, more so, in fact, than any document of the kind that has come to our notice for a long time. An attempt has been made to twist the meaning of one or two sentences in the report, and to invest them with a significance which it is plain they were not intended to have, but that is not because of any defect in the report itself, which is expressed in language not open to misconstruction. In diagnosing Germany's present ills the Wiggin committee reaches exactly the same conclusions as those proclaimed by the Seven Power Conference at the termination of its labors on July 23. Germany is suffering from excessive short-term foreign credits and its problem is how short-term credits can be reduced and in part at least converted into long-term credits. Temporary provision can be made for taking care of part, at least, of the excessive short-term credits, and, in fact, arrangements to that end are provided in the report itself. These consist of extending the short-term credits provisionally through the renewal for a period of six months of the $100,000,000 credit obtained in June from the Bank for International Settlements, in association with the Bank of England, the Bank of France, and the Federal Reserve banks of this country, with similar renewals by other foreign creditors of the Reich. With regard to these arrangements the report says: \"We have placed ourselves in touch with the banking groups which have been negotiating with Germany lirtintrie NO. 3452 as to the terms on which the existing short-term credits should be maintained. At our invitation, representatives of these groups and of the German banks met in Basle on Friday, Aug. 14, and after five days' study and consideration have agreed upon and will recommend a plan of prolongation of such credits to the numerous creditor banks and bankers for their acceptance.\" \"This agreement,\" it is stated,\"provides for a continuation of credits to German debtors up to the total then outstanding for a period of six months from the date of the signing of the agreement, subject to an arrangement being made with regard to existing central bank credits. An individual agreement,\" it is added, \"in an approved standard form will be made in every instance directly between the German debtor and the foreign creditor. The form of this agreement,\" we are told, \"has been drawn up so as not to interfere in any way with the normal relations previously existing between the parties; while it involves certain specific assurances it is essentially based upon a broad foundation of mutual confidence.\" The report then adds: \"Realizing that it is to their interest to assist in every way possible to insure the stability of the reichsmark, the foreign creditors have come to an arrangement with Germany that the immediate release of their reichsmark balances shall be only partial and the remainder will be gradually released during the term of the agreement. \"The plan further provides two forms of additional security to creditors participating in the plan. One is to associate direct responsibility on part of the final credit taken with that of the debtor bank itself. The other is an undertaking by the German Gold Discount Bank to take over or guarantee within certain limits the indebtedness to foreign creditors, thus lending the important support of the Gold Discount Bank resources and prestige to the obligation. \"Provision has been made to secure by Government decree or otherwise that foreign creditors of German banks shall receive equal protection to that of creditors residing in Germany.\" With reference to long-term credits, however, the situation is different. The Seven Power Conference could devise no means to that end, and the Wiggin committee is equally helpless. It can only state the indispensible preliminaries that must be met before Germany can hope to obtain foreign aid along that line. It is in the remarks on that point that the differences of interpretation have arisen. The concluding words in the report read as follows: \"We therefore conclude by urging most earnestly upon all the governments concerned that they lace no time in taking the necessary measures for bringing about such conditions as will allow financial operations 1164 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE to bring to Germany—and thereby to the world— sorely needed assistance.\" What are the indispensible prerequisites? The committee has named them in a previous paragraph where it says: \"We think it essential that before the period of prolongation of credits recommended by the London conference (the Seven Power Conference) comes to an end, they should give to the world assurance that international political relations are established on the basis of mutual confidence which is the sine qua non of economic recovery, and that the international payments to b6 made by Germany will not be such as to imperil the maintenance of her financial stability.\" It is this reference to international payments to be made by Germany that is construed as meaning that there must be a complete revision of international debt payments which would mean payments which the Allies are obliged to make to the United States. If such revision should be undertaken it would be flying in the face of public sentiment in this country, which is unalterably opposed to anything of the kind. Besides, in a time of business depression like the present it would be virtually impossible for the United States to forego the Allied payments. Surrendering the payment for a single year, such as was involved in President Hoover's moratorium proposal, is one thing, and permanent yielding up of such payments is quite another thing. Moreover, no one in this country would ever be persuaded that France, which is overflowing with gold, is not able to make, with absolute ease, the payments required under the agreement with the United States. However, the Wiggin committee goes further than this and mentions other obstacles that must be overcome. It says: \"Second, we would point out that the case of Germany provides a most forcible illustration of the fact that in recent years the world has been endeavoring to pursue two contradictory policies in permitting the development of an international financial system which involves the annual payment of large sums by debtor to creditor countries, while at the same time putting obstacles in the way of the free movement of goods.\" This last plainly has reference to the tariff barriers which with increasing force one country after another has been placing against all other countries, and which constitute a more serious drawback than is involved in the German reparations payments. On that point the report speaks without equivocation or reserve, and also in very convincing fashion, adding: \"So long as these obstacles remain such movements of capital must necessarily throw the world's financial balance out of equilibrium. Financial remedies alone will be powerless to restore the world's economic prosperity until there is a radical change in this policy of obstruction, and international commerce—on which depends the progress of civilization—is allowed to assume its natural development.\" This last, it will be observed, is apart from the caution enjoined that the reparations payments to be made by Germany shall not be in excess of Germany's ability to pay. Both, however, are political questions lying wholly outside the province of the Wiggin Committee, and reference to them is made simply because, as the report itself says, \"We have felt it to be our duty to point out the reasons why it is impossible for the present to suggest defiaite plans for securing to Germany long-term credits.\" This [Von. 133. last is the crux of the whole matter, and the Wiggin Committee, like the Seven Power Conference, finds itself obliged to give up the whole job as hopeless. In that respect the report is disappointing, but at least it possesses the merit of being a clear presentation of the facts of the case. An outcropping of bank failures in Ohio has been one of the unpleasant developments of the week. There is no reason to think, however, that these failures have anything more than a strictly local significance or that the ill consequences will extend beyond the local field within which they occurred. They seem to have had their origin in the closing on June 17 of the Security-Home Trust Co. of Toledo, a $36,000,000 institution. The 60-day limit then imposed by many of the Toledo banks on the withdrawal of deposits expired on Monday and Tuesday of the present week. Preliminary notices filed with the banks, of intention to draw out deposits, made it apparent that the withdrawals would be very heavy. At the same time plans for merging three of the institutions which this week have gone down, so as to create a consolidated institution sufficiently strong to cope with the situation, came to grief at the last moment. The three institutions referred to were the Ohio Savings Bank & Trust Co., with deposits on June 30 of $45,526,716 and resources of $58,117,115; the Commerce-Guardian Trust & Savings Bank, with deposits of $21,328,006 and resources of $27,016,882, and the Commercial Savings Bank & Trust Co., with deposits of $13,069,244 and resources of $15,160,216. When it appeared at special meetings on Saturday night of last week that the merger of the three institutions could not be carried through, no alternative remained (in view of the certain large demand upon the institutions on Monday) but to vote to close down. A fourth institution, namely the American Bank, with deposits of $1,044,000 and resources of $1,524,000, was forced to close at the same time because its reserves were tied up in the Ohio Savings Bank & Trust Co. and the Commercial Savings Bank & Trust Co. The three institutions first mentioned had aggre gate resources, it will be seen, in excess of $100,000,000, and the Security-Home Trust, which went to the wall in June, had resources, as said, of $36,000,000, the whole thus constituting a formidable breakdown for a city of the size of Toledo. Even though the disturbances were local and confined mainly to the Northwestern part of the State of Ohio (some minor banks in that territory having likewise failed) it is obviously not well to make light of a banking collapse of such magnitude. As it happened, too, the building and loan associations found it necessary to invoke the 60-day limit on payments. In this we refer not merely to the associations in Toledo, but to those at Akron, Ohio, and Cuyahoga, some small banks in those sections having also gone to the wall. The local situation, as a consequence, at one time was in a highly critical state, all business being transacted on a cash basis at retail establishments. Only one large department store in Toledo, according to newspaper accounts, advertised on Monday continuance of its charge accounts. After a brief period, however, the three large banks in Toledo which remained open, namely, the Toledo Trust Co., the First National Bank of Toledo, and the Spitzer-Rorick Bank, were able, with the assistance of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, to AUG. 22 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE cope effectively with the situation. Nevertheless, large sums are tied up in the suspended institutions, and some time must necessarily elapse before Northwestern Ohio can be expected to return to normal. The price of cotton has taken a further tumble the present week. Middling upland spot cotton here in New York sold down to 6.50c. on Wednesday, and yesterday was 6.65c. The proposal of the Federal Farm Board that the cotton planters should plow under every third row of growing cotton in the fields has fallen flat, and is now largely the subject of ridicule. Other suggestions of the same kind, like that of Governor Huey P. Long of Louisiana, who sent telegrams to all Governors, United States Senators, Congressmen, and Lieutenant-Governors of the cotton-growing States, asking them to unite in laying plans for enacting State legislation prohibiting \"the raising of a single bale of cotton in all cotton-growing States during the year 1932\" appear to be no less devoid of merit. News came on Thursday that the Federal Farm Board would make advances to cotton farmers on their 1931 crops on the basis of 1c. a pound less than the market price of the staple, on the condition that the planters wishing to take advantage of the offer deposit their cotton with some one of the recognized co-operative associations— which is not entirely to the liking of many of the planters. It has been pointed out that last season the Board loaned farmers up to 90% of the value of the cotton, and in 1929 took over cotton at 16V a 2c. pound, which contrasts strangely with the prevailing price of less than 7c. a pound at the leading Southern markets, and at some points at even less than 6c. Exceedingly gloomy views regarding the future value of the staple have been occasioned by the Farm Board's proposal of last week that planters destroy one-third of their growing cotton. For ourselves we are unable to subscribe to the dismal views which for the moment appear to be finding such wide acceptance. Even supposing that the 1931 crop should be as large as estimated last week by the Agricultural Bureau, namely, 15,584,000 bales, which remains to be proved, not enough allowance is made in our estimation for the decided probability of a greatly increased consumption of the staple as the result of the inordinately low figure to which the price of cotton has fallen. Low prices are always a stimulus to consumption, and never more 60 than in the case of cotton. This has been demonstrated over and over again. The consul)* ption of cotton is not likely to continue at the low levels of the last two seasons. But even if it does, American cotton at existing prices is certain to displace the inferior cotton of other countries, India cotton, for instance. That has happened over and over again. At proper price levels no other cotton in the world can compete with American cotton. Japan, which ordinarily takes a large quantity of India cotton, will take more American cotton and less India cotton, or at all events will stock up with American cotton to a greater extent than before. China also, which raises an inferior grade of cotton, some of which finds its way to market in Japan, will likewise find American cotton given a preference at present prices, not only by Japan, but by its own home consumers of cotton. Moreover, if newspaper accounts are to be believed, China will bave a greatly reduced production the present year as a 1165 result of the gigantic floods and overflows in the Yangtse River districts which are doing such immense damage. We had an illustration back in 1926-27 of what can happen in the way of increased takings of cotton by foreign consumers when the price of the American staple gets down to a tempting basis. The United States had raised in 1926 a perfectly enormous crop, in fact, the largest crop on record—a crop which fell only a little short of reaching 18,000,000 bales (exclusive of linters), and when prices, as a result, slumped badly. The whole cotton trade was in utter despair at the time, and it seemed as if the country would not be able to get rid of its burdensome supply for years to come. But the foreign consumer came to the rescue and took cotton on a scale never before witnessed. From 8,251,459 bales in the season of 1924-25, and 8,234,705 bales in 1925-26, the exports of cotton from the United States ran up to 11,223,439 bales in 1926-27. This was an increase, it will be seen, of, roughly, 3,000,000 bales in a single year. Every leading country increased its takings of cotton in a most notable fashion, the shipments to Germany running up from 1,736,812 bales in 19251926 to 2,952,846 bales in 1926-27; the exports to Great Britain from 2,290,989 bales to 2,582,439 bales; to Japan from 1,083,912 bales to 1,560,840 bales; to France from 917,268 bales to 1,024,762 bales; to Russia from 245,588 bales to 506,958 bales, and so on all through the list. Even India, such a large exporter of its own cotton, but cotton far inferior, as already stated, to that from the United States, took 299,170 bales in 1926-27 against next to nothing in preceding years, the shipments to India in 1924-25 having been only 2,291 bales and in 19251926 to 17,463 bales. The Orient alone—Japan, China and India—took considerably in excess of 2,000,000 bales of American cotton in that year; in fact, took 2,134,577 bales. As a result of this huge increase in the exports and a smaller acreage in 1927, the price of spot cotton in New York, which had sold down to 12.15c. a pound in December 1926, advanced to 18.90c. the following July. But now the price of cotton is very much lower. As already stated,it touched 6.50c. here in New York on Wednesday. The inducement to the taking of American cotton will be correspondingly greater. As a matter of fact, exports of cotton from the United States to Japan and China are already running very much higher than in the corresponding period of last year. Japan, indeed, has been taking increased amounts of cotton in this country in each and every month of the current calendar year; and for the seven months from Jan. 1 to July 31, 750,612 bales of American cotton have gone to Japan in 1931 against 410,848 bales in the corresponding seven months of 1930. China ordinarily is not a large consumer of American cotton, using not much above 200,000 to 250,000 bales a year, but is now also taking our cotton very freely. For instance, in May the present year the shipments to China were 36,330 bales as against 8,270 bales in May last year; in June the exports to China were 37,605 bales the present year against 5,722 bales in June last year; in July they were 65,359 bales as against 7,875 bales, and in the first three weeks of August they amounted to 27,025 bales against 4,949 bales. In the following table we furnish comparative figures for two years of the movement of cotton to both Japan and China for each month, beginning with May: 1166 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE COTTON EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES. (Running Bales.) —To China —To Japan— 1930. 1931. 1930. 1931. Bales. Bales. Bales. Bales. 8,270 36,230 May 65,943 26,038 5,722 37,605 60,148 36,901 June 7,875 65,359 78,460 15,725 July 4,949 27,025 27,022 17,050 August (3 weeks) 231,573 95,714 166,219 26,816 Total It will be observed that in this period of less than four months Japan has taken 231,573 bales of cotton from the United States the present year against 95,714 bales in the same period of 1930, and China has taken 166,219 bales against only 26,816 bales. Japan and China together have taken 397,792 bales in 1931 against only 122,530 bales in 1930. This has happened at the tail end of the crop year in the two seasons when supplies from the new crop were not yet available. It will be interesting to watch the export movement in succeeding weeks and months when the new crop comes to market in increasing amounts as the season progresses. Irrespective of what amounts of American cotton the Orient may take, it seems assuming no great risk to assert that when the new crop gets under way the cotton export movement as a whole from the United States will reach proportions that will leave the movement of the last two seasons very considerably in the rear. The Federal Reserve statements this week disclose a number of interesting features. In the first place another large addition appears to the volume of Federal Reserve credit outstanding as measured by the holdings of bills and securities. Last week these holdings of bills and securities increased from $941,582,000 to $1,064,781,000; the present week there has been a further increase to $1,118,229,000. For the two weeks combined, therefore, there has been an expansion in the volume of Reserve credit outstanding in the large sum of $176,637,000. The holdings of acceptances, which last week jumped from $66,074,000 to $135,738,000, have the present week further increased to $154,628,000. This time, however, it would appear unsafe to conclude that the new increase represents purchases of foreign bills in connection with the $125,000,000 credit extended to the Bank of England for the purpose of sustaining the sterling exchange market. The reason is that no increase in these bill holdings appears at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We do not know what plan is pursued in allotting these foreign bill purchases among the different Federal Reserve banks, but at least the major portion of any increase on that account should go to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That bank, however, shows its total bill holdings (domestic and foreign) reduced from $69,960,000 Aug. 12 to $63,166,000 Aug. 19. On the other hand, the bill holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland have run up during the week from $9,142,000 to $14,395,000, and this leads to the conclusion that heavily increased offerings of bills were made to the Reserve bank as a result of the Ohio banking troubles which have been such a conspicuous feature the present week. On the other hand, however, on the liability side of the account we find that the foreign bank deposits, which recently have been mounting up so rapidly until on Aug. 12 they reached $180,483,000 against only $5,676,000 on June 17, have this week fallen to $168,408,000, and it may be that if these foreign bank deposits consist, as generally sepposed, of deposits [VOL. 133. by the Bank of France, that some of these deposits were used in the purchase of sterling bills in this market. The discount holdings of the 12 Reserve institutions have also sharply increased the past week, rising from $194,980,000 Aug. 12 to $230,609,000 Aug. 19. And here again the Ohio banking troubles would appear to have been responsible for the change, since the discount holdings of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the week actually decreased from $49,886,000 to $38,775,000. Oontrariwise, these discounts by the Reserve Bank of Cleveland increased from $16,892,000 to $30,517,000. Combining the increase in the discounts at Cleveland with the increase in the bill holdings, the Cleveland Reserve Bank appears to have been drawn upon for help in connection with these Ohio banking troubles in amount of $18,878,000. Sporadic banking troubles in other parts of the country would appear also to account for increases in the discount holdings and the bill holdings at some of the other Federal Reserve banks. San Francisco, where some bank failures have also occurred, is a conspicuous Instance of the kind. The San Francisco Reserve Bank shows the discounts up during the week from $10,689,000 to $33,501,000, and the bill holdings up from 9,351,000 to $12,339,000, an increase in the two items combined of $25,800,000. The holdings of United States Government securities at the 12 Reserve banks changed very little during the week as far as the total is concerned, this being reported at $727,890,000 the present week (Aug. 19) as against $727,961,000 last week (Aug. 12), though there have been some sharp changes in the different items going to make up the total. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation further increased during the week for the 12 Reserve institutions from $1,829,301,000 to *1,901,844,000, and gold reserves also increased, but in a smaller amount,rising from $3,449,182,000 Aug.12 to $3,472,861,000 Aug. 19. Very little interest attaches just now to the figures of brokers' loans as reported by the member banks in New York City, inasmuch as these loans are now down to relatively low figures. This week these brokers' loans show a small increase, the amount rising from $1,329,000,000 to $1,343,000,000, after a long series of weekly decreases. In the different categories of loaning, loans for own account by the reporting member banks in New York increased during the week from $936,000,000 to $950,000,000, while loans for account of out-of-town banks decreased from $230,000,000 to $228,000,000, and loans \"for account of others\" increased from $163,000,000 to $165,000,000. There is little change in the foreign trade statement of the United States for the month of July, issued this week. Merchandise exports were again slightly reduced from the recent very low level, and imports continued less than in four of the preceding six months this year. The value of exports for the past month was reduced to $183,000,000 and imports to $175,000,000. It was about this time in 1930 that the foreign trade of the United States first began to fall away quite sharply, so that the losses for last month, compared with a year ago, are relatively smaller than has previously been the case. Merchandise exports for July, at $183,000,000, compare with $266,761,000 in July of last year, the reduction this AUG. 22 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE year being $83,761,000, or 31.4%, while imports, at $175,000,000 for the month just closed, were $45,558,000 less than the $220,558,000 reported for July 1930, the reduction being equivalent to 20.7%. For the seven months of this year to date merchandise exports are valued at $1,499,225,000 against $2,342,478,000 in the same period of 1930, the reduction this year being $843,253,000, or 36.0%, while imports, at $1,282,359,000, compared with $1,956,543,000 for the same period a year ago, a decline this year of $674,184,000, or 34.5%. This change in conditions will undoubtedly become more marked as the year advances. The balance of trade in July continued on the export side, but was for a very much reduced amount, exports exceeding imports by only $8,000,000; a year ago the excess of exports was $46,203,000. For the seven months of the current year the excess of exports has been $216,866,000 against an export trade balance for the same period of last year of $385,935,000. Both exports and imports of merchandise for the past three or four months show a smaller volume of trade each month measured by the value. The reduction, however, for each month was not large. With commodity prices showing a more or less constant decline during this same period, the probability is that the actual movement measured by the quantity has not materially changed. For example, cotton exports in July, the closing month of the cotton year, were, as is customary, the smallest of the year, being 270,132 bales, and exceeding by a considerable amount cotton exports of a year ago. The increase this year was 93,700 bales, or 53.1%. On the other hand, the value of cotton exports for July of this year was less than that of last year, the amount being $13,530,000, a decline of $1,047,000 from July 1930, a decrease of 7.2%. The constant reduction in the price of cotton is the occasion for this situation. It has characterized the export trade return now for many months. For the seven months of 1931 the change is relatively even much greater than appears for the month of July. Gold exports in July were larger than in any preceding month this year, while imports declined. Exports amounted to $1,009,000 and imports to $20,497,000. In June gold exports were only $40,000 and imports $63,887,000, while for the seven months of this year exports of gold have been only $1,798,000; imports were $260,438,000. The excess of gold imports for the year to date amounts to R258.640,000. In the corresponding period of 1930 gold exports were $51,191,000 and imports $254,087,000, the latter exceeding exports for that period by $202,896,000. Silver exports last month were $2,304,000 and imports $1,640,000. For the year to date silver exports have been $17,080,000 against $33,710,000 a year ago, and imports $15,674,000 compared with $27,226,000 for the corresponding period of 1930. The stock market this week has zigzagged a good deal, but as the week progressed developed a distinctly weak tone. About the only special feature was a severe break in the market on Monday, due to news regarding the banking troubles in Ohio, more particularly in Toledo, where four banking institutions with aggregate resources in excess of $100,000,000 and aggregate deposits in excess of $80,000,000 concluded over the week-end to close down after some strenuous efforts to keep agoing in conferences during Saturday and Sunday. A shortage • 1167 . of cash for retail trade resulted from the closing down, but while this was relieved with the aid of the other banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, on the other hand the building and loan associations deemed it incumbent to impose limits upon withdrawals. This happened not only at Toledo, but the loan associations at other points in Northwestern Ohio took similar action. On the whole, the situation assumed a serious aspect, at least locally, and our stock market reflected apprehension by turning sharply downward after last week's improving tendency in prices. On Tuesday, however, the market enjoyed a sharp recovery as it appeared that the Ohio troubles had been effectually dealt with and were not likely to extend beyond the local territory directly involved. The rest of the week the market moved in an aimless fashion, with prices now slightly up and then down. On Friday the market again turned definitely downward. There were no distinctly new features of great consequence to affect the course of prices. The oil stocks displayed special strength in the belief that the drastic measures taken by the Governors of Oklahoma and of Texas would prove effective in reducing the output of oil and lead to the establishment of higher levels of prices both for crude oil and its prod ucts. An unfortunate feature continues to be the steady decline in all classes of bonds except those which are deemed positively gilt-edged. On Wednesday no less than 50 separate issues of bonds touched new low levels for the year. This week's decline in bonds may have reflected necessitous selling in connection with the Ohio banking trouble, but the course of bond prices has been downward for a long time past. Call loans on the Stock Exchange again continued unchanged at 11 2%,and the Stock Exchange / rate may be considered as pegged at that figure. A total of 59 stocks recorded new low figures for the year during the week, while 20 stocks established new high figures. Trading has been moderately larger. At the halfday session on Saturday of last week the sales on the New York Stock Exchange were approximately 900,000 shares; on Monday, 1,300,000 shares; on Tuesday, 1,700,000 shares; on Wednesday, 1,100,000 shares; on Thursday, 1,100,000 shares, and on Friday, 1,300,000 shares. On the New York Curb Exchange the sales on Saturday were 155,500 shares; on Monday, 209,855 shares; on Tuesday, 241,175 shares; on Wednesday,203,170 shares; on Thursday, 246,730 shares, and on Friday, 234,345 shares.

[VOL. 133. IS Stock exchanges in the important European financial centers showed no deviations this week from earlier trends, all dealings still being overshadowed by the financial crisis in Central Europe and its world wide repercussions. The Berlin Bocrse remained closed under the edict of the German Government issued before business began on July 13. There were no official indications of an early reopening, but it is now believed the German exchanges will resume gradually with no margin trading allowed at first and full reopening likely about Sept. 1. The Berlin \"Boersen Courier\" estimates that unofficial prices of German stocks are about 15% below the last official quotations of July 11. The London and Paris exchanges remained in the doldrums all week, with the slow trading resulting in few changes of any moment in quotations. An interesting decision to open the London Stock Exchange for trading on Saturdays was reached by a committee Thursday and posted on the Exchange. \"In view of the situation of the country and the desirability of affording facilities for dealings, the committee for general purchases has resolved to open the Stock Exchange on Saturdays on and after Sept. 19\" the statement said. A London report to the New York \"Times\" stated that the drift of business in international issues on Saturdays to American stock brokers was one of the chief reasons for the decision. The London Stock Exchange has remained closed on Saturdays since 1917 so that the decision will interrupt a practice of 14 years standing. A further incident that occasioned much interest in London was an announcement last Saturday that Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, was sailing that day for Canada. The Bank issued a statement saying that Mr. Norman was seeking complete quiet and entire freedom from work on medical advice. European trade reports, meanwhile, show that the situation remains much depressed, with definite signs of improvement lacking. The official British total of unemployed went to a new high figure of 2,714,359 in Tuesday's return, an increase of 39,270 in a week. The German total of unemployed holds at about 4,000,000. The London Stock Exchange was soft and dull at the opening, Monday, notwithstanding the announced determination of the Government to balance the budget. The possibility of a tax on fixedinterest issues as one measure for increased Government income produced nervousness among holders of gilt-edged issues, and considerable liquidation developed. British Government securities were hard hit by the selling, sharp recessions appearing. The industrial market was inactive, with prices inclined to drop both in the British and international sections. A slow and not very pronounced rally in British funds developed Tuesday, the tendency being to await further developments on the budget. Oils were better under the influence of closed American wells. British industrial stocks were off as a result of unexpected dividend reductions by leading companies in the textile industry, while international issues were uncertain. A harder tone in the London market finally appeared Wednesday, partly as a result of further rumors that a general 10% import duty might be levied. Business remained small, but quotations improved in almost all departments. An irregular tendency prevailed Thursday, with British funds easier on renewed fears of special taxation of bond interest. British industrial stocks showed no AUG. 22 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 1169 movements of consequence, while the international was said to be dependent on a similar extension to descriptions made slight gains.

The position which has arisen in Geraffecting Germany and other European countries many, the summary states, is due largely to the with varying degrees of acuteness for the last two world-wide depression, but also partly to the parmonths. It is not, of course, a final one, since the ticularly vulnerable position in which the country question of repayment will clearly be a difficult one found itself. Foreign indebtedness of Germany six months hence and further banking agreements grew much faster than her assets in other lands durare thus foreshadowed. The committee met Aug. 8 ing the period between 1924 and 1930, it is pointed under the chairmanship of Albert H. Wiggin, Chair- out. Total foreign indebtedness of the Reich is estiman of the Board of the Chase National Bank of mated at more than 25,500,000,000 marks, which is New York. It included also eminent bankers from in part offset by German foreign assets of 9,700,Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Switzer- 000,000 marks, leaving a net debt to foreigners of land,'Sweden, Holland and Japan. As the discus- about 15,800,000,000 marks.

The during these years were not effected out of Geragreement for prolongation of the private credits many's resources and will not be so effected until 1170 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE an appropriate part of these commercial debts are repaid in the form either of gold, goods or services.\" Even in the most favorable German foreign trade year of 1930, borrowing abroad was necessary to provide one-third of the sum needed for foreign payments. The report points out that the weakness in the German financial situation at the end of 1930 arose out of the fact that whereas Germany's foreign shortterm indebtedness was no less than 10,300,000,000 marks, having increased to that figure from 4,100,000,000 marks at the end of 1926, Germany's shortterm investments abroad,including foreign exchange holdings of the Reichsbank, amounted only to 5,300,000,000 marks. \"The increase in short-term debt was quite out of proportion to the growth of foreign trade,\" it is said, \"and there is little doubt that it was used to a large extent to replace working capital when long-term money proved not available. While it would have been better if these short-term credits could have been converted into a long-term debt, it was probably not possible, and,in any event, was not done. When, therefore, an outflow of capital occurred, it found Germany in a very vulnerable position, which, in spite of an export surplus exist. ing during the first six months of 1931, produced a serious crisis. It is estimated that the withdrawal from abroad of short-term funds in the first six months of 1931 amounted to 2,900,000,000 marks, in addition to which there was a certain amount of selling by foreigners of long-term investments in Germany and purchases by Germans of long and shortterm investments abroad. In all, the outflow appears to have been about 3,500,000,000 marks. \"The committee expresses no view regarding the capacity of Germany to provide her capital needs out of internal savings, but emphasizes that the piling up of her obligations is no ultimate solution of her problem. The immediate credit needs involve the cessation of withdrawals, for which purpose the committee has been in touch with the bankers regarding the so-called 'standstill' agreements with foreign countries whereby existing credits will be maintained. The committee concludes that unless part of the capital withdrawn can be replaced the economy of Germany will continue in a condition of severe strain.\" Mobilization of German assets abroad is not considered a remedy for the situation by the committee, while the alternative of heavily reduced imports and greatly increased exports by Germans also is viewed unfavorably, owing not merely to the dislocation this would occasion in German economic life but also the serious effects on other markets. It was held advisable from all viewpoints, accordingly, that the existing volume of Germany's foreign credits be maintained and that part of the capital recently withdrawn be replaced from foreign sources, rather in the form of long-term credits than of short-term loans. Proceeding in the second part of the report to a consideration of conversion possibilities, the committee states that the German economic position does not appear unfavorable for a transformation of a portion of the short-term debt into long-term obligations. It is remarked, significantly, that there has been a rapid recovery of Germany's export trade in recent years. The authorities of the Reich, moreover, are said to have given proof of their determination to put the public finances on a sound basis. At present, however, conversion possibilities are ruled [VoL. 133. out on the sufficient basis of the low prices now prevalent for German securities on foreign securities markets. \"Two fundamental difficulties remain to be overcome,\" the report adds. \"Until the relations between Germany and other European powers are established on a basis of mutual confidence there can be no assurance of continued economic progress. The second condition relates to the external obligations of Germany. So long as these obligations, both private and public, are such as to involve either a continuous increase in snowball fashion of the foreign debt of Germany, or, alternatively, a disproportion between her exports and imports on such a scale as to threaten economic prosperity of other countries, prospective investors are unlikely to regard the situation as stable.\" The committee recommended, accordingly, as quoted above, that the powers represented at the London conference take measures for the restoration of world confidence in political relations and provide assurances that payments by Germany will not imperil her financial stability. The summary provided by the committee concludes with a reference which is plainly a suggestion for lower tariffs, as already noted further above. The full text of the report was made available Thursday, and it is reprinted in full in subsequent pages of this issue. Added to the report itself are nine annexes and statistical tables, dealing with such subjects as the German balance of payments, foreign exchange movements, capital positions, budgetary estimates and economic activity. These addenda were not made available. The recommendations of the committee provoked much comment in all capitals, with conjecture centering especially on the possibility of acfion at or during the League of Nations Council and Assembly meetings next month. Representatives of all the nations concerned, with the exception of the United States, will attend the League sessions, it was pointed out, and Basle reports suggested that the first steps toward adjustment of the political difficulties might be taken in Geneva. The bold prediction was reported in a Basle dispatch to the New York \"Times\" that within the next six months or so there will be \"the biggest conference the world has seen in years, and its job will be to make real peace.\" A move was said to be afoot to have all the important European Premiers, as well as the Foreign Ministers, attend the Geneva gatherings, so that decisions on the largest questions could be made without delay. This movement was said to have British sponsorship. There was no official comment of any kind in Washington on the report of the committee. It was pointed out by William R. Castle, Jr., Acting Secretary of State, that the meeting in Basle was one of bankers who had no relationship whatever with the United States Government. \"So far as the. Government is concerned, it is not merely a financial question, but one that must await some crystallization of public opinion,\" a Washington report to the New York \"Times\" said. Bankers in New York considered the report a good one, although there was not much enthusiasm regarding the prospects of early action on the recommendations. Paul M. Warburg, Chairman of the Manhattan Company, who permitted himself to be quoted, remarked that the report is \"entirely sound,\" and added he was glad the committee had the courage to go to fundamentals. Atro. 22 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE In London the report was viewed as a further warning that the whole problem of reparations must be reconsidered quickly if chaos is to be avoided. The implications of the report were considered a reflection of the views long held by the city. Comment in Paris was reserved, but all information from Basle was read with the keenest interest. Mixed feelings were aroused in Berlin by the results of the Basle meeting. The six months' extension of short-term credits was regarded as too short a period, and some apprehension was manifest concerning further possible developments at the expiration of the agreement. Much satisfaction was expressed, on the other hand, over the recommendations of the committee, which were viewed as a public recognition by leading financial authorities, though only by implication, that the burden of German reparations is too heavy. Various proposals for balancing the British budget have been under consideration this week by the special Cabinet Committee headed by Prime Minister MacDonald, but measures that will prove satisfactory to all three parties in Britain have not yet been formulated. The Cabinet Committee based its studies on the report of the governmental economy committee, which warned of a prospective deficit of £120,000,000 unless stringent measures of economy are adopted. Mr. MacDonald sought to allay the apprehensions aroused by the disclosure. \"There is nothing wrong with Britain,\" he said in London late last week. \"Our difficulties are the results of the bad state of world trade and are not caused by the fact that Britain is in a bad way. With reduced national income there must be reduced national expenditures, if the country is to pull through. This means there must be emergency measures to husband the country's resources.\" The Cabinet Committee formulated early this week a series of emergency proposals designed to meet the situation, and discussions regarding their acceptability were promptly started with the Conservative and Liberal party leaders. The proposals under consideration were not officially divulged, but the more important ones were apparently revealed by the London \"Daily Herald,\" which is considered the mouthpiece of the Labor Government. A general 10% tariff on imports of manufactured goods for revenue purposes was the foremost of the items, according to the account in the \"Daily Herald.\" Other proposals included temporary suspension of the sinking fund on the national debt, a special tax on fixed income securities, increased contributions to the unemployment insurance fund by workers and employers, and voluntary conversion of war loans to lower interest rates. Difficulties rapidly appeared in the discussions of means, even the Labor followers of the Government raising objections to the schemes presented by the Cabinet for their consideration. The Trades Union Council expressed dissatisfaction, it was said, because the Government proposed too much economy to suit it. The Cabinet Committee discussed the proposals Thursday with Neville Chamberlain and Sir Samuel Hoare, representing the Conservatives, and Sir Herbert Samuel and Sir Donald MacLean, who acted for the Liberals. The Conservative Opposition declined to support the plans, it was indicated, because the economies were not considered sufficient to effect the purpose. Liberal conferees stated they \"didn't 1171 reach the point at which one could say we were satisfied or not.\" At least one major reorientation in the European political scheme has resulted from the Central European financial crisis, reports from Hungary making this amply clear during the current week. The financial difficulties were felt severely in Hungary and drastic banking restrictions were applied late in July under emergency decrees of the Budapest Government. Foreign credits extended Hungarian nationals on a short-term basis were withdrawn to a considerable extent, and the need of the country for fresh credits became acute. Aid was proffered by an international banking group headed by French interests, and including bankers of Switzerland, Holland and Italy. Reports from Budapest stated that this consortium was ready to advance $25,000,000 to Hungary, with the French bankers agreeing to a participation of 50%. Although it is stated that no political stipulations were attached, it is plausible that the transaction will influence Hungary to develop closer relations with France, even if it does not cause absolute relinquishment of the close friendship with Germany and Austria. After much hesitation this loan was concluded at Paris Aug.14 for a period of one year, with interest at 6%. The funds thus placed at the disposal of the Budapest Government made possible a resumption of normal banking activities in Hungary this week. Banks reopened Monday, and no further troubles were reported, owing largely to a Government guarantee of the gold value of all deposits until Aug. 30. A further consequence of the transaction, however, was the resignation, Wednesday, of the Cabinet headed by Count Bethlen, who for 10 years has guided the destinies of the Balkan State. It is reported in a special cable to the New York \"Times\" that Count Bethlen first tendered his resignation to the Regent, Admiral Horthy, the day after the credit was accepted by the Hungarian Government. He was urged to remain in office, the dispatch adds, because the resignation would give the impression that the Premier \"was refusing to associate himself with the pro-French orientation.\" Count Bethlen persisted in his intentions, and an announcement of the resignation was issued Wednesday. \"The real reason for his retirement,\" a Budapest report to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said,\"may be found in the insistence of France on a new orientation of Hungary's foreign policy as the price of financial help.\" Count Julius Karolyi, Foreign Minister in the Bethlen Cabinet, was invited to form a new Cabinet. Negotiations are said to be in progress for disposition to France of a large part of the Hungarian grain surplus. Although further efforts were made by rebel bands this week to overthrow the Government of Cuba headed by General Gerardo Machado, little success attended their endeavors, and the Machado regime remains in apparent control. Messages received at the State Department in Washington yesterday from Ambassador Guggenheim predicted the speedy end of the revolt. The revolution which has been brewing in the island for more than a year reached the stage of active military movements against President Machado two weeks ago. Former President Mario G. Menochal and Colonel Carlos Mendieta, leaders of the revolutionary junta, counted upon 1172 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE the support of the Cuban populace, and they made their greatest efforts in Pinar del Rio Province, where discontent has been widespread. The first severe clash of the rebellion occurred in Pinar del Rio late last week, and it resulted in the capture by the loyal forces of General Menocal and Colonel Mendieta, together with a number of their followers. Few details of the encounter have been made available, but the blow to the rebels was a severe one, and the Cuban Government had no hesitation in announcing that the backbone of the revolt had been broken. Additional fighting developed this week, however, with the most important engagement taking place at Jibara, in Oriente Province, where a force of 350 rebels landed from the United States last Monday. After bitter fighting, in which scores were reported killed or wounded, this rebel force was defeated Wednesday. Government troops, airplanes and a gunboat joined forces to defeat the rebel band, which was captured almost in its entirety. After this incident the Government lifted the drastic censorship which had been imposed. Havana reports late this week indicate that further rebel forces are operating in Santa Clara Province, and some encounters also were reported in the suburbs of the capital, but it was remarked that the success of the Government against the Jibara force leaves little doubt of an early termination of all active military movements against President Machado. The situation is still said to be tense, however, some accounts stating that fully 95% of the Cuban population is opposed to General Machado and anxious for a change. Washington reports stated emphatically that the United States is unlikely to intervene unless a virtual state of anarchy develops in Cuba. Some international complications may develop, however, as it was reported Thursday that the Danish vessel Frederiksborg had been subjected to bombing and machine gun fire while in Cuban waters. Famine conditions in the thickly populated valley of the Yangtze, which has overflowed its banks in Central China, prompted the Nanking Nationalist Government of China to start negotiations with the Federal Farm Board in Washington this week for the purchase on long-term credit terms of part of the wheat stocks held by this agency of the United States Government. An inquiry as to terms of such a transaction was received by the Farm Board Monday, the Chinese Government transmitting the suggestion through Paul W. Meyer, American Consul at Nanking. Nothing was revealed officially regarding the amount of wheat that might be sold if the negotiations resulted favorably, but informal reports from Washington indicated that it would not exceed 15,000,000 bushels. Chairman Stone, of the Farm Board, stated Thursday that the proposal had received favorable consideration and that negotiations for the sale of the surplus grain would be entertained. It was intimated that obligations of the Nanking Government had been offered as security for payment, and that the sales price probably would be the market figure on the day of shipment. Shanghai dispatches stated that the Chinese Government planned to distribute the grain free at first, in order to alleviate suffering. After the flood waters of the Yangtze recede supplies would be made available only in payment for repair work on the dikes and railway embankments and land rehabilitation. The need of flood and famine relief in China [vol.. 133. is indeed desperate, as the floods are the worst known in a half century. Great areas have been inundated and some estimates of drownings run as high as 15,000, while literally millions have been made destitute. The American Red Cross announced Wednesday that $100,000 had been made available for victims of the floods. Much uncertainty regarding the success of the second Round Table Conference on India has been occasioned by a decision of Mahatma Gandhi, leader of the powerful Nationalist group, not to attend the gathering. Mr. Gandhi's absence from the first conference in London,last year, proved very disconcerting and the failure of the gathering to make any substantial progress toward settlement of the mutual problems of the British and the Indians was widely attributed to this fact. The truce between the Government at Simla and the Nationalist followers of Gandhi last March was followed by arrangements for the second conference, scheduled to open in London Sept. 5. Only two days before the Indian delegates were scheduled to sail for London, a decision was reached by the All-India National Congress Working Committee not to send a representative to London, and Mr. Gandhi promptly announced his intention to abide by the decision. The action was taken, he said, because of the refusal of the Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, to appoint an impartial committee to investigate alleged violations by the Government of the Delhi truce. In subsequent statements the Indian leader indicated that the purported violations were in the form of coercive collections of taxes from peasants. A group of 27 delegates representing other parties in India sailed from Bombay last Saturday, but Mr. Gandhi held to his decision, and little hope is now entertained regarding the prospects of an early settlement of the Indian problem. The Nationalist leaders stated this week that they have no immediate intention of resuming the civil disobedience campaign. The London Government announced Thursday that it was summoning a round table conference to discuss a separate Constitution for Burma and the future relations of Burma and India. This gathering will assemble in London next November, before the Indian round table conference adjourns. The Bank of Germany this week marked its Lombard rate down from 15% to 12%.

The range this week has been from 4.85 7-16 to 4.85% for bankers' sight bills, compared with 4.85 1-32 to 4.85% last week. The range for cable transfers has been from 4.85% to 4.86, compared with 4.853jto 4.85 13-16 a week ago. Although sterling continues below the gold export point as compared with several of the Continental exchanges, with the exception of Paris, the Bank of England lost very little gold to Europe this week, and what it did ship went principally to Holland. On balance the Bank's gold holdings have improved. For nearly two weeks the London check rate on Paris has shown evidence of being pegged around 123.93123.95 and this fact is interpreted as proof that sterling is being supported in the Paris market by the Bank of France. It is also apparent that the banks on this side have been taking precautions to prevent undue pressure on sterling. At all events foreign exchange movements are clearly not normal, and but for central bank support the pound would be ruling lower, although seasonal pressure against London is still a few weeks off. Some uneasiness is displayed regarding the difficulty facing the British Government in balancing its budget. The plans proposed thus far to overcome or to eliminate the budget deficit are of a nature which might easily induce a flight of capital from London which would, of course, depress sterling. The plans of the Labor Government for overcoming the deficit in the budget are given in greater detail in another column. Sterling and all the major currencies are still dominated by the German situation. Bankers say that while there is great improvement in the German situation and prospects, foreign exchange markets will be abnormally affected by the events of the crisis for perhaps a year or more until the German financial difficulties have been completely resolved. This week the Bank of England shows an increase in gold holdings of £1,565,847, the total standing at £134,870,075, which compares with £155,365,515 a year ago. On Saturday the Bank of England received £1,b00,000 in sovereigns from abroad and exported £2,000 in sovereigns. On Monday the Bank bought £222 in gold coin, received £200,000 in sovereigns from abroad, and exported £2,000 in sovereigns. On Tuesday the Bank released £350,000 in sovereigns and exported £14,000 in sovereigns. On Wednesday the Bank exported £2,000 in sover- eigns. On Thursday the Bank bought £7,600 in gold bars and exported £10,000 in sovereigns. On Friday the Bank exported £9,000 in sovereigns. At the Port of New York the gold movement for the week ended Aug. 19, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consisted of imports of $6,515,000, of which $4,000,000 came from Argentina; $1,365,000 from Mexico; $1,000,000 from Uruguay, and $150,000 from other Latin American countries.

Much interest is displayed in New York in the results of the deliberations of the Wiggin committee in Basle. The investigations of the committee reveal that the German short-term foreign indebtedness amounts to roughly Rm. 7,300,000,000, compared with earlier estimates of Rm. 5,500,000,000. Comprised in the committee's total are Rm.5,000,000,000 foreign credits to banks, Rm. 1,500,000,000 to industry and Rm.800,000,000 to public bodies. The consortium of Germany's foreign creditors, also at Basle, working in close conjunction with the Wiggin committee, signed an agreement on Wednesday to prolong Germany's short-term credits for six months.

FINANCIAL CHRONICLE Bankers' sight on Amsterdam finished on Friday at 40.333, against 40.30M on Friday of last week; cable transfers at 40.343', against 40.32, and commercial sight bills at 40.28, against 40.28. Swiss francs closed at 19.45 for checks an at 19.453/b for cable transfers, against 19.493/ and 19.50. Copenhagen checks finished at 26.73 and cable transfers at 26.74, against 26.73 and 26.74. Checks on Sweden closed at 26.75 and cable transfers at 26.76, against 26.74 and 26.75, while checks on Norway 2 finished at 26.73 and cable transfers at 26.743/, against 26.73 and 26.74. Spanish pesetas closed at 8.83 for bankers' sight bills and at 8.84 for cable transfers, against 8.58 and 8.59. Exchange on the South American countries continues unsatisfactory owing to the political uncertainties in most of these republics. Argentine paper pesos have fluctuated rather widely during the week, ranging from 29.14 on Saturday of last week down to 27.83 on Thursday, and closing on Friday at 28%. This compares with par of 42.45. As noted above, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported the receipt of $4,000,000 from Argentina during the week. It is thought probable that Argentina will meet the $50,000,000 maturity on Oct. 1 by the shipment of a corresponding amount of gold. This shipment of gold is expected to bring about a stringency in money for circulation in the Argentine. Gold in the Caja de Conversion on Saturday last totaled 313,905,469 gold pesos. Gold deposited in Argentine legations abroad totaled 11,259,148 gold pesos, making total gold reserves 325,164,617 gold pesos, which is 61.2% gold backing for the paper currency in circulation. This reserve will be reduced to a fraction below 51% by the shipment of $50,000,000 in gold to New York during September to repay the loan falling due on Oct. 1, for the renewal of which American bankers have not offered terms acceptable to President Uriburu. New York bankers say that the difficulty in renewing such a loan at this time lies in the fact that in view of the depressed condition of South American bonds at present, a public offering of a refunding issue would be next to impossible. All the Argentine long-term loans currently active are selling at less than 75 cents on the dollar. A dispatch from Santiago, Chile, on Wednesday stated that the Government has ordered a complete moratorium on foreign debts for the remainder of this year. A partial moratorium was declared last month and since then funds to cover the interest have been deposited in Santiago as a guaranty of future payment. Wednesday's decision, however, declared that all external debt payments are to be suspended since funds are no longer available for the interest deposits. Argentine paper pesos closed at 28% for bankers' sight bills, against 293 on Friday of last week and at 283/b for cable transfers, against 29%. Brazilian milreis are nominally quoted 6.35 for bankers' sight bills and 6.40 for cable transfers, against 7.45 and 7.50. Chilean exchange is nominally quoted 12.10 for bankers' sight bills and 12.15 for cable transfers, against 12.10 and 12.15. Peru, not quoted. dollars were not affected by the slump in Shanghai and continued to rule around 23.88. Until the past week or so there has been a good demand from China for silver in this market, but a sharp decline is now apparent. The American Bureau of Metal Statistics reports that the silver shipment to China in July from New York amounted to 3,084,000 ounces, compared with 2,145,000 ounces in June, and 1,645,000 ounces in May. Shipments from San Francisco to China in those three months amounted to 1,401,000, 1,299,000, and1j1,804,000 ounces respectively. The decline in demand from China of late is attributed to the heavy floods and prospects of famine in many parts. ChirTal, Which will necessitate increased pur.of chases of foodstuffs from abroad. Unusual buying of provisions is already reported. If China is compelled to pay cash, it is feared that silver and the Chinese exchanges will suffer. If long-term credits are granted, the strain will be spread over a greater period and unfavorable affects will be avoided. Japanese yen are steady. Japanese export surplus is gaining steadily. As noted above, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported the receipt this week of $5,000,000 of gold from Japan. This follows the receipt last week of approximately $15,000,000 gold from Japan, which arrived at San Francisco. Closing quotations for yen checks yesterday were 49.34@49, against 49.33@4932 Hong . Kong closed at 23U@24 1-16, against 235 8@ / 23 15-16; Shanghai at 29%@30, against 29%; Manila at 49%, against 49%; Singapore at 569', against 56%; Bombay at 363, against 363j, and Calcutta at 363I, against 363.

The report of the Wiggin committee is a dignified and forcible document, dealing adequately with the particular matters intrusted to the committee, and at the same time embodying recommendations which the strict limitations imposed upon the committee by the London Conference did not clearly envisage. The committee was appointed \"to inquire into the immediate and further credit needs of Germany and study the possibilities of converting a portion of her short-term credits into long-term credits.\" This task the committee, aided by representatives of the banking groups which have been negotiating with Germany regarding the maintenance of existing shortterm credits, and by representatives of the German banks, has performed as thoroughly as the financial data available permitted.
