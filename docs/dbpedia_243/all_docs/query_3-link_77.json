        "text": "No matter what your career goals are; the town, city, or country you want to work; what you’re passionate about; or the work life balance you need; there’s a place for everyone in nursing.\n\nLydia Francis (BSN’20) is a registered nurse (RN) in Prince Albert (PA) and wouldn’t change it for anything.\n\n“As a registered nurse, the opportunities are endless,” said Francis.\n\nFrancis completed her University of Saskatchewan (USask) nursing degree in April 2020, worked as a graduate nurse before passing her national licensing exam in May 2020, and from there, she started her career as a full-time registered nurse.\n\n“I have worked on a medical floor, at a COVID testing site, taught nursing students, was part of a medical mission trip to South America, and I currently work in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Victoria Hospital,” said Francis.\n\nShe chose USask College of Nursing to complete her degree because the full Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program was offered in Prince Albert.\n\n“I liked the idea of a smaller campus where instructors get to know you, small classes to build relationships with classmates, and an affordable university degree, since I didn’t have to move.”\n\nSince 2012, USask College of Nursing has been offering the BSN program at various locations throughout Saskatchewan, including USask campuses in Saskatoon and Prince Albert and distributed nursing sites in La Ronge, Île-à-la-Crosse, Yorkton, and Lloydminster.\n\nStarting this September, the program will be offered in North Battleford and Muenster and starting in fall 2025, Swift Current and Weyburn.\n\nBy offering the BSN program at a distributed nursing site in North Battleford for example, USask College of Nursing is giving students in North Battleford and surrounding area the opportunity to learn where they live. When students complete their nursing education in the community, they will likely practice there afterwards once they become licensed, helping to fill unmet registered nursing workforce needs in northwest Saskatchewan.\n\n“I love that in nursing there are always opportunities to learn and grow, since the medical field is continually evolving and we’re always trying to improve patient care and outcomes,” said Francis.\n\nFor Francis, her first day on the job was one she will never forget.\n\n“My first day as a grad nurse was the first day we had COVID hit PA, so that immediately created a whole set of challenges for everyone in healthcare, including new grads like me!”\n\nBut she’s moved forward from that, learned invaluable lessons from the experience, and had many rewarding days since then.\n\n“One of the highlights of working in ICU is seeing the patients who are really sick, get well again, and witnessing the joy their families feel – it is such a special moment and so rewarding as a nurse who provided care! Another highlight for me in my career so far was going to Guyana on my medical mission trip, and being able to use my nursing skills to provide care the people of Guyana couldn’t access or afford.”\n\nAs for her plans for the future, Francis plans to continue working in the ICU and has already signed up to teach several USask nursing labs in the 2024/2025 academic year. Plus, she has another medical mission trip in the works that she’s looking forward to!\n\n“I encourage anyone thinking about becoming a registered nurse to join me and help make a difference in the lives of people right here in Saskatchewan.”\n\nThe USask BSN is a 1+3 program. Students take their pre-professional year at USask campuses in Saskatoon and Prince Albert, at the University of Regina, or at a number of regional colleges throughout the province. The remaining three years are completed through the College of Nursing in Saskatoon (USask Campus), Prince Albert (USask Prince Albert Campus), La Ronge or Île-à-la-Crosse (Northlands College), Yorkton (Suncrest College), Lloydminster (Lakeland College), North Battleford (North West College), Muenster (St. Peter’s College), Swift Current (Great Plains College), and Weyburn (Southeast College).\n\nFor more information on the University of Saskatchewan Bachelor of Science in Nursing program in North Battleford, please visit USask Admissions or the North West College website.\n\n—\n\n*This article was submitted by Kylie Kelso, Senior Marketing and Communications Specialist, University of Saskatchewan College of Nursing.\n\n."
