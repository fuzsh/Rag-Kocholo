        "text": "The integration of renewable energy sources in building design is a crucial strategy for promoting sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of buildings. By incorporating technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems, the construction industry can significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper explores the fundamental principles and criteria for utilizing renewable energy in sustainable building design. It highlights the benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation. Through an extensive review of current literature and detailed case studies, the study demonstrates how renewable energy contributes to more sustainable and energy-efficient buildings.\n\nGreen building is not just a matter of assembling a collection of the latest green technologies or materials. Rather, it is a process in which every element of the design is first optimized and then the impact and interrelationship of various different elements and systems within the building and site are re-evaluated, integrated, and optimized as part of a whole building solution. By blending the right mix of green technologies that cost less with green technologies that cost the same or slightly more, it is possible to have a very green building project that costs the same as a conventional one. Often the key to a cost effective green building and site design lies within the interrelationships and associated cost and performance trade-offs that exist between different building systems. It is also paramount to separate the role of the different participants in ensuring that the building consumes minimal resources during its life cycle and that it poses a minimal threat to the environment by minimizing the ecological footprint. The main aim of this project is to add various renewable energy sources to green building and create a 3D model on Autodesk Revit Architecture.\n\nAfter the energy crisis in 1970s, buildings began to be used as a platform for the elements which produce energy from renewable energies to return them into energy producing power plants. This is a safe, clean and economic way to produce energy since the energy is produced where it is needed and they use renewable energy resources. So, it promises hope for the future energy production. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine buildings which produce electricity by using renewable energy resources and to show that this is one of the safest, cleanest and most economic ways to be used to produce energy in the future. This is done by describing power plants and how buildings are used as power producing stations by the use of renewable energy resources or other energy producing materials, then by examining case studies which are constructed and already being used, case studies which are just a design that have not yet been constructed, and by making projections to the future energy producing techniques that are just a proposal in 2021. In the conclusion, buildings are proposed as the future power plants, either here on earth or on another planet like Mars.\n\nThe use of renewable energy has been increasing in various applications in Bangladesh, but is concentrated mostly in rural regions. This paper will discuss areas in which renewable energy can be implemented in the architecture of urban Bangladesh. The aim is to point out architectural interventions that reduce dependency on energy consumption. Whereas climatic considerations during building design help in creating low energy architecture, the activities within a building and comfort needs for occupants still require some active energy input. If Architects aim to reduce dependency on conventional fossil energy and try to work in some renewable energy use in the operation of buildings, then savings will act as a bonus under the strained energy situation in Bangladesh. This paper discusses options available for renewable energy use in buildings of Bangladesh in urban areas with particular emphasis on Building Integrated Photo Voltaic systems or BIPVs.\n\nThe environmental impact generated by the residential sector on energy consumption is estimated at approximately 40%. Architecture and urban planning practice is on the front line directly applying best-case evidence-based solutions to make the most of conserving and generating energy. The excessive and inevitable growth of cities derived in both high and low rise building in most of urban central areas to accomplish social and regular housing demands. Simultaneously, a sustained development of clean energy production technologies and computer simulation allows for an increasingly more accurate prediction of the potential that the architectural morphology possesses on the production of clean energies. High rise buildings bring together: possibilities of high density housing, daylighting access limitations in low floor apartments and issues related with the exploitation of solar irradiation for renewable energy purposes. Today's powerful building simulation tools can be leveraged for energy modeling during early design phases and even to shape the morphology of tomorrow's cities. For further reductions in building energy consumption, energy simulations done during conceptual design have potential to impact long term energy use both in architecture and urban planning. This paper reviews early conceptual designs of buildings and their interaction with the immediate built environment looking at the consequences in terms of daylight availability and the potential of irradiation use for clean energy generation.\n\nThe Thermal Test Facility (TTF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, was designed and constructed using a whole-building energy design approach. This approach treats a building as a single unit, not as a shell containing many separate systems. It relies on the use of energy simulation tools for optimization throughout the design process, and requires the involvement and commitment of the architect, engineer, and owner. It can produce a building that requires substantially less energy than a building designed and constructed with conventional means. TTF operating costs are 63% less than those of a code-compliant basecase building. These savings were achieved by implementing an approach that optimized passive solar technologies and integrated energy-efficient building systems. Passive solar technologies include daylighting, high-efficiency lighting systems, engineered overhangs, direct solar gains for heating, thermal mass building materials, managed..."
