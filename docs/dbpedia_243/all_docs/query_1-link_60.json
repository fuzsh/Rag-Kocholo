With the massive amounts of precipitation in Mexico this year, many of the rain-soaked hillsides have become very dangerous. Vanguardia's headline says \"There are at least 400 missing in the landslide\" It is referring to a huge slide that occurred very early this morning (4:00 a.m.) in Santa María Tlahuitoltepec in the state of Oaxaca. It goes on to say \"The Governor of Oaxaca, Ulises Ruiz, is going to Santa Maria Tlahuitoltepec to coordinate the rescue work personally.\"\n\n\"I have just returned from a week's visit to Ixtapan de la Sal, Valle de Bravo and Toluca (all about 100 km. southwest of Mexico City.) Between here (Saltillo) and there, a distance of roughly 1,000 km., very heavy rain was encountered. A pleasant side effect is that the countryside is very lush and green as opposed to desert brown, which is normal for this time of year. It sort of camouflages the extent of the weather calamities that have befallen Mexico this year.

Frost! Alberta's vast crop fields are 2-3 weeks behind schedule due to the unusually heavy amounts of rain this summer and with temperatures dipping dangerously close to freezing most nights the crops are at huge risk. The Wheat and Barley can take some frost but the Canola would be killed outright by it. Farmers are keeping their fingers crossed in hope that a killing frost doesn't happen.\n\nI don't hold out much hope for that, knowing the direction things are going. It will be just another reason for skyrocketing food prices and indeed, food shortages. I'm sure you agree that we should all make like squirrels and be storing long-lasting foodstuffs. - C.
