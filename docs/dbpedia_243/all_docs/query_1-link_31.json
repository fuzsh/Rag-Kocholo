        "text": "Learn to do by doing.\n\nThat’s what 4-Hers from 27 different clubs across eastern Saskatchewan are doing for the next few days as they participate in the annual Yorkton Exhibition Spring Steer and Heifer Show.\n\nMembers have traveled to Yorkton from as far as Tisdale in the north, the U.S. border in the south and Moose Jaw in the west to participate in the event.\n\nJeff Just is a director with the Exhibition and has been involved with this 4-H show for a number of years.\n\n“They get experience showing an animal whether it be for an achievement day or cattle shows,” says Just. “It’s all experience for down the road, it’s\n\nalso an excellent way to meet other 4-H members there.”\n\nMost participants arrive on Thursday and will immediately get down to work in the judging competition.\n\nThe showmanship. team grooming competitions and Jackpot Show will take place most of the day Friday, with their pie fundraiser and talent show happening that night.\n\n“We have volunteers make pies and then we auction them off.”\n\nJust says this event doesn’t happen without the volunteers and the sponsors.\n\nThe three days of events wrap up with the Open Show on Saturday, where every project gets shown off.\n\nFor more information on the event click here.\n\nRural Roots Canada is a proud sponsor of the Yorkton Exhibition Spring and Steer Show and congratulates all of the members on all the hard work they have put into their projects, 4-H Club and community this past year."
