        "text": "To preface I currently live in Vancouver working in the trades. My Uncle inherited the family farm in rural Saskatchewan from my grandparents.\n\nMy Uncles health has taken a dramatic decline over the past year and unfortunately it appears he will have to permanently move into a care home, he was living by himself leasing most of the land to another farmer. If this happens the family farm will inevitably have to be sold, I've estimated its worth between $1.25Million - $1.5Million depending on cultivatable land and soil quality and I believe its 1.5 sections . My uncles wish is to die on the farm, its all he's ever known.\n\nAnyways here's where I come in, I move onto the farm with my uncle and he teaches me the basics of farming (He is still mobile and active) while he still can, I take care of his needs, I farm the land, and he gets to enjoy his last days on the farm.\n\nI have only recently pondered this idea. Its hard to see a future in the Vancouver rat race but on the other hand rural Sask is a completely different lifestyle whether I should or shouldn't move from BC to Saskatchewan is a completely different question. My cousin is also a farmer although 5+ hours away, he makes about $150k (net before tax). He is married with no kids, and spends the most part of his winter on the beaches of the Caribbean\n\nI by no means intend to get the farm for free, By end of year I will have approximately $200k cash. I am in my twenties and single, my uncle is in his late seventies single and has no children. My question is as follows.\n\nIdeally how would this be financially structure this to benefit all parties?"
