To His Honour, Sir Richard Lake, K.C'.M.G., Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Saskatchewan. May it Please Your Honour, — The undersigned has the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report of the Department of Education for the year ended Decem- ber 31, 1919. Respectfully submitted, William Melville Martin, Minister of Education. REPORT OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION Regina, March 1, 1920. Hon. W. M. Martin, K.C., Minister of Education. Sir, — I have the honour to submit for your consideration the Annual Report of the Department of Education for the year ended December 31, 1919. The School Act. — A number of important changes in The School Act were made at the session of the Legislative Assembly which opened on November 27, 1919. Sections 30 and 79 were amended so as to provide one hqur for polling in rural districts. The period for polling has consequently been made uniform in the case of the first election of trustees, election of trustees at annual meetings and an election at a special meeting to fill a vacancy in the board. Hitherto the time had varied from thirty minutes to two hours. The amendments were designed to prevent confusion which had appeared in practice. Section 51 was redrafted so as to provide that in case a new school is being built in a district to replace an old building, which may or may not be centrally located, the board apply to the council of the municipality or to the Department as the law may require for the approval of the site upon which it is proposed to build the new school. Sections 54 and 55 were revised with a view to setting forth clearly the procedure in connec- tion with applications for the alteration of the boundaries of school districts. This phase of departmental work has increased very considerably in recent years due chiefly to a tendency in village and town districts to increase their taxable area in order to cope with increasing costs in school administration and in the case of rural districts to a desire of municipal councils to equalise taxable areas as far as possible within the municipality. Most of the sec- tions dealing with the authorisation of a debenture loan by the Local Government Board and the issue of debentures by a school district have been changed and a number of new sections added, so that on and after May 1, it will be necessary for boards of trustees in connection with the application for a debenture loan to submit to the Local Government Board a resolution setting forth details of proposed capital expenditure and for a bylaw to be passed after the approval of the resolution. This bylaw must in every case be referred to the ratepayers and a poll taken thereon. On account of the greatly increased cost of building and particularly in view of the better class of building now being erected, especially in rural districts, the period of a debenture for frame buildings has been extended to fifteen years. Section 210 has been amended so as to increase the fees that may be charged pupils attending high school classes in public schools and section 211 so as to increase 12 Department of Education the fee to ten cents per teaching day per family in the case of non- resident pupils. Fees in connection with high school work are charged in a number of cases in village and town districts where owing to the small taxable area difficulty is found in obtaining adequate funds for school purposes. The School Attendance Act. — Suggestions for radical amend- ments to The School Attendance Act, having in view chiefly the elimination of the mileage limit for compulsory attendance, extend- ing the age limit and extending the compulsory standard to be attained by pupils before exemption might be allowed, were received from several sources. The consensus of opinion, however, of those most qualified to judge of the operation of the Act was that a more stringent law was not at present desirable or indeed capable of application in view chiefly of the pioneer conditions still existing in many parts of the province. At a conference of inspectors of schools it was clearly shown that the law was being justly and fairly administered and was working satisfactorily and that its provisions had materially improved the attendance of pupils in all the elementary schools. Certain amendments were made, however, with a view to facilitating the administration of the law. Particularly, subsection (2) of section 6 was repealed and it was provided in the new subsection that a child over thirteen years of age who had passed Grade Y could be relieved from attending school for not more than thirty teaching days during the year if such child’s services were required in husbandry or in urgent or necessary household duties. The new subsection requires a certificate of exemption which may be issued subsequent to a resolution at a regular or special meeting of the board, setting forth the reasons for relief. Section 24 was amended by the addition of a subsection imposing a penalty upon any parent, guardian or other person who neglects or refuses to give a teacher or any person appointed by the department or any board such information as is required by the Act or gives false information and upon any person who by threat, intimidation or otherwise prevents or attempts to prevent the attendance of a child at school in accordance with the terms of the Act or in any other way interferes or attempts to interfere with the carrying out of its pro\\isions. The School Grants Act. — This Act was amended so as to increase to two dollars the sum payable per evening session for each teacher employed in a night school and a new section 3a was added providing for a grant to a rural district for a teacher’s residence, such grant not to exceed one-third of the cost thereof and to be made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council after evidence has been furnished that such a residence is requisite for the proper operation of^the school and that without financial assistance from the province the district is unable to erect a teacher’s residence. Debentures. — Two hundred and ninety-three districts were authorised to issue debentures to the total amount of $1,581,770, as compared with 212 districts and a total of $512,770 in 1918. There were registered for sale the debentures of 277 districts for Annual Report, 1919 13 amounts totalling $1,461,695.26, the corresponding figures for 1918 being 197 districts and $609,150. The largest debenture authorised was for the sum of $175,000 for Saskatoon. It is interesting to note that the debentures authorised for school districts during the year amount to slightly more than three times the amount of debentures authorised during the year 1918. This indicates that after the close of the war much building which had been delayed because of war conditions was undertaken. Finances. — The amount expended on school sites and buildings was $1,546,622.51. The amount expended for teachers’ salaries was $4,813,000.42, an increase of $981,058.38 over 1918. This increase is not altogether accounted for by the increase in the number of departments in operation but is very definite evidence of the substantial advance in teachers’ salaries. The amount expended for all purposes was $12,673,124.76. The total govern- ment grant for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1919, amounted to $1,292,954.52, of which sum $91,547.73 was paid for the support of secondary education. School Organisation. — During the year the School District Organisation Branch of the Department was organised with an inspector in charge. This branch is held responsible for the admini- stration of the law as it applies to the erection of new school districts, alterations of boundaries of school districts, the selection, approval and expropriation of school sites, the election of trustees, the operation of schools, the appointment of official trustees and many other matters closely connected with these subjects. At the beginning of the year there were 4,145 school districts in existence. During 1919, 155 new school districts were established while four- teen districts were disorganised, leaving at the end of the year a total of 4,286 school districts in existence. Of these, 4,159 operated schools, an even better record than that of 1918, when it was reported that the ratio between the number of schools in operation and the number of districts in existence was the best in the history of the Department. Naturally some time must elapse before a newly organised district can build a school and have it ready for operation and, therefore, some districts which were organised during the year would not be able to commence operation until 1920. In cases where the number of children of school age in the district is insufficient to warrant the operation of a school the trustees are required to provide for the conveyance of the children to a neighbouring school and to pay for their tuition at this school. Under this plan forty-two school districts provided educational facilities for the children of their districts during 1919. The number of departments in operation during the year was 5,132, an increase of 288 over 1918. This indicates a very healthy growth in the school population and also that the school officials in both the urban and rurgl districts are providing fairly satisfactorily for the increased number of children of school age. Seven school districts were established directly under the pro- visions of section 37 of The School Act. In almost every case the residents had proved unable to carry on the organisation 14 Department of Education proceedings, but the number of children in the territory concerned made the establishment of the district necessary. In the better settled portions of the province as the population gradually increases more school accommodation is required. This may be provided by the erection of more districts but as all the territory is usually included within the boundaries of existing districts the establishment of new school districts causes considerable alterations in boundaries and owing to the opposition aroused in the older established districts the provision of additional accom- modation by this method is often very much retarded. If new districts are not established then the old districts must erect more buildings and to do this they often require additional territory, which again means alterations in the boundaries of existing districts with consequent opposition. The third method of providing the additional accommodation required is gradually meeting with most favour and is spoken of as the consolidation of school districts. When all the factors are taken into consideration it is sometimes very difficult to state which method is the most suitable but there is no doubt that in certain portions of the province we have reached the parting of the ways. By proceeding in one direction we shall establish more and smaller districts, each having one school room in operation. Thus the schools will be brought slightly nearer to the homes of the children, but all the weaknesses and disadvantages of the one room school inadequately supported financially will remain. In the other direction we may proceed towards graded schools and the conveyance of children to school and this is undoubt- edly the most progressive procedure wherever the expense can be ■easily borne. As an indication of the amount of work connected with the alterations of boundaries it may be mentioned that notice of the alteration of the boundaries of every district must be published in The Saskatchewan Gazette and during the year 1919, 479 such notices were published. In certain cases an application for an alteration in the boun- daries of a school district must be made to the Minister of Education and the Department has found it very satisfactory to refer the most difficult- cases to a board of arbitrators as provided by section 57 of The School Act. Approximately thirty applications were dealt with by this method during the year. One high school district, Kamsack, was established while three high schools, namely, Estevan, North Battleford and Swift Current, were raised to the rank of collegiate institutes. Thus there were thirteen high schools and ten collegiate institutes at the close of the year. The names of twenty-two school districts were changed, most •of them acquiring by the change names more suited to public institutions existing in a British country than the names by which they were known formerly. Consolidation of Schools. — What is commonly known as a consolidated school district in this province is merely a large school district with an area of at least thirty-six square miles. In such a district the board of trustees is required by law to provide for the Annual Report, 1919 15 expense of the conveyance of children of resident ratepayers, residing more than one and one-half miles from the school, to and from school each day. A special grant is paid equivalent to one- third of the actual amount spent for conveyance. Six large school districts were established during the year, while one was disorgan- ised before it had been put into operation, owing to the dissatis- faction existing among the ratepayers of the outlying portions of the district. Because of the erection of these large districts seven other districts were disorganised. The new consolidated districts organised were at Viscount, Colonsay, Markinch, Bridge- ford, Conquest and Ardath. Owing to the different conditions existing in the several localities the details of operation in these large districts vary considerably. For example, in the rural areas of the large districts the rate of taxation varies from 4J4 to 20 mills on the dollar and in the urban areas from 5 to 33 mills on the dollar, while the average cost of conveyance per pupil for the year varied from $44 to $218. The cost of transportation increased much during the year; in some cases as much as $7 per day being paid for a van route. Most officials are convinced of the advantages of consolidation and it is worthy of note that the average attendance of all these large districts was about ninety per cent. The greatest expenditure was made by the Cupar school district , which has an area of fifty-six miles and an enrolment of 284 pupils. The cost of conveyance was $7,730.75,. while the teachers were paid $5,850. The total grants received by the district during the year were $3,141.22. The total number of large (consolidated) school districts in existence on December 31, 1919, was twenty- eight. Free Readers. — The following table shows the number of readers of each class distributed during the past two years: Year Phonic Primer Alexandra Primer First Reader Second Reader Third Reader Fourth Reader Total 1918 16,751 18,240 20,322 23,422 16,727 19,826 15,705 19,015 13,421 18,767 10,876 16,716 93,802 115,986 1919 The most notable increases are in the issues of Third and Fourth Readers, 5,346 in the former and 5,840 in the latter over 1918. This is an indication of a substantial improvement in educational conditions in the province, the figures representing a large number of promotions to the Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Grades. The total increase in the distribution of Free Readers over 1918 is 22,184. Training and Supply of Teachers.— The number of certificates issued in 1919 was 3,286 as compared with 2,758 in 1918, an increase of 528. The number of provisional certificates issued shows a very considerable decrease. They numbered 539, being 445 less than in 1918, and of these 71 were granted to returned soldiers. The records also show that of the 3,286 certificates issued, 1,992 were granted to teachers trained in Saskatchewan. 16 Department of Education The following table shows the average salaries paid to teachers for the years 1918 and 1919 and also classifies the certificates held by teachers employed in the province at any time during these two years: Average Salaries First Class Second Class Third Class Provisional Male F’male Male F’male Male F’male Male F’male Urban — 1918 $1,493 $1,003 $1,221 $ 912 $1,113 $ 879 $1,080 $ 950 1919 1,634 1,132 1,352 1,020 1,205 962 900 980 Rural — 1918 1,027 994 1,002 951 989 905 1,027 940 1919 1,185 1,125 1,152 1,074 1,120 1,027 1,148 1,053 Classification—- Totals 1918 217 481 325 2,014 283 1,830 190 722 6,062 1919 30C 580 457 2,548 328 1,669 184 320 6,386 Examinations. — The total number of candidates for depart- mental examinations of all classes in 1918 was 8,399 and in 1919, 6,973. The decrease is due to the fact that no departmental examination was held for Third Class, Part I. It is expected that in 1920 the number of departmental examinations will be further reduced by omitting the examination for Third Class, Part II. The number of pupils recommended for promotion by principals of schools under the High School Regulations was 732 in 1918 and 1,001 in 1919. The movement to dispense with the set public examination as a means for determining standing has in recent years received general approval among educationists. Saskat- chewan has probably gone farther than any other province in Canada in this direction. The system finds very general acceptance among the teachers of the province and up to the present time, from the point of view of the Department, has operated satisfactorily. Teachers’ Exchange. — The work of the Teachers’ Exchange increased to such an extent during the year 1919 that it was found necessary to make an addition of one stenographer to the staff and, for part time, an extra clerk. During the year, 739 teachers were placed, an increase of 475 over 1918. Of these teachers, 427 were placed in English-speaking districts, forty-nine in German districts, six in French districts, thirty-three in Ruthenian districts, two in Indian schools and 224 in districts of mixed nationalities. Twenty-one teachers were placed as principals in town and village districts. Five hundred and sixty-six were placed in rural districts within fifteen miles of the railway, sixty-eight in schools between fifteen and twenty-five miles from the railway and thirty-four in rural schools over twenty-five miles from the railway. The actual placing of teachers represented only about half the work Annual Report, 1919 17 done by the Exchange, the remainder of the time being taken up with correspondence leading to the encouraging of boards of trustees to take better care of their teachers, to provide satisfactory accom- modation and offer sufficient remuneration. Inspection of Schools. — Four new inspectorates were organised in 1919 at Turtleford, Mortlach, Kerrobert and Vidora and the following inspectors appointed: L. Charbonneau, B.A., G. D. Robertson, B.A., Robt. Weir, B.A., F. W. Rowan, B.A., B. W. Wallace, W. J. Small, B.A., and C. A. Scarrow, B.A. B. W. Wallace was assigned to the Yorkton Inspectorate, a position made vacant by the appointment of Dr. J. T. M. Anderson as Director of Education among New Canadians. W. J. Small took over the Biggar Inspectorate in the place of R. W. Asselstine, B.A., appointed to the staff of the Normal School at Saskatoon, and on the resignation of J. J. Stapleton, M.A., C. A. Scarrow was made inspector at Kincaid. These appointments brought the total number of inspectors of schools to forty-five, as compared with five covering the same territory in 1905. Notwithstanding interference with inspection due to the large number of inspectors engaged in Normal School work in the earlier part of the year and to the early approach of winter, 1919 was a very good year for the inspection of schools. The number of schools inspected was 3,894 and the total number of inspections made, 6,974. These figures represent an average of 86.53 schools inspected and an average of 154.75 inspections per inspector. Assistance was given in the inspection of schools by the following members of the Normal School staffs: R. W. Asselstine, J. H. Hedley, J. S. Huff, J. H. McKechnie, F. M. Quance and A. S. Rose.

This figure does not accurately represent the conditions of attendance which are in reality very satisfactory. The figure is considerably lowered, for example, by the enrolment of the same pupils in two or more schools during the year. The reports of inspectors of schools and calculations made on other bases indicate that the average attendance for the province is approximately 77% of 18 Department of Education the enrolment. A movement is under way for the Departments of Education in the various provinces to adopt a uniform system of statistics. A change in the method of finding the percentage of attendance will probably come into effect in 1921. In this event the figures given for the percentage of attendance throughout the Dominion will be based on similar sets of statistical facts and will be properly comparable. Plans of School Houses. — A statement from the Provincial Architect contains the following information. Districts to the number of 182 were supplied with school plans in 1919, twenty-fiv districts were supplied with plans for teachers’ residences, 153 plans for alterations were approved, seven inspections were made at the request of boards of trustees in connection with new buildings or alterations. . In twenty-two cases the Provincial Architect was unable to give his approval of the plans submitted. Exhibitions and Conventions. — School exhibitions to the number of 207 were held in 1919, an increase of 32 over 1918. Judges for exhibitions were supplied from the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Extension Department of the University of Saskatchewan, the Normal Schools and by some of the Collegiate Institutes. The majority of the judges gave lectures or addresses at the school exhibitions. Rural Education Associations. — At the close of 1919, 116 rural education associations were in operation, an increase of thirty- three over 1918. Three inspectorates, namely, Elbow, Milestone and Humboldt, were completely organised in 1919 into rural education groups. School Agriculture. — Boys’ and girls’ clubs have developed relatively faster than any other phase of school agriculture work. Short courses in school agriculture, school gardening, nature study, etc., were given at the Third Class Normal School sessions at Estevan, Weyburn, Moosomin, Yorkton, Prince Albert and Saska- toon and a discussion of school exhibition work was held with First and Second Class students at Saskatoon and Regina. The development of the rural education association with its varied activities, particularly the school exhibition, made the appointment of Mr. F. W. Bates, B.A., M.Sc., as Director of Rural Education Associations and School Fairs, a necessity and this appointment was made to take effect on January 1, 1919. Great use was made of the Better Farming Train in connection with educational work, 11,670 children from 388 schools being in attendance, together with 327 teachers. Special mention should be made of a special short course in agriculture conducted in Moosomin by A. M. McDermott, B.S.A., in co-operation with the Collegiate Institute. Twenty-seven students were in attendance, their ages ranging from fourteen to fifty-seven. In addition to the various phases of agriculture the tudents received instruction in the use of business forms, literature, Annual Report, 1919 19 economics, composition, writing, public speaking, arithmetic and physical training. The work was thoroughly practical, neighbour- ing farms being visited for stock judging, etc. As a result of lec- tures given by Mrs. Feeny, school nurse, fifteen members of the class obtained First Aid certificates. A detailed description of this experiment in education is contained subsequently in this report. Household Science. — In the month of September a year’s leave of absence was granted to Miss F. A. Twiss, Director of House- hold Science, to .enable her to continue her studies at Columbia University, New York, and Miss Isabel Shaw was appointed Acting Director. Miss Hiltz and Miss Neelands resigned in June, their places being taken by Miss Jean F. Flatt and MissMargaret McColl, the appointments being made on September 1st. Short courses were given at Estevan, Melfort, Herbert, Watrous, Gren- fell, Rosthern, Cabri, Griffin, Moosomin, Indian Head, Unity, Leader, Oxbow, North Battleford, Wilkie and at the Summer School for teachers at Saskatoon. The ultimate purpose of such short courses is to familiarise citizens and school authorities with the value of this phase of education with a view to the appointment of teachers on the staffs of the large centres qualified to teach a certain amount of the household science course or, in case a district does not require the full services of a teacher in household science, to join one or more districts in the employment of an itinerant teacher. Short courses also stimulate attention to such matters as the provision of the hot lunch in rural schools. School Hygiene. — The work in school hygiene made very rapid progress in 1919 and the following were appointed on the staff in this branch: Miss Cassie Willoughby, Mrs. E. L. Shaw, Miss M. Russell, Miss Jean Urquhart, Miss Olive Fuller, Miss Gertrude Kilburn and Miss Ruby Simpson. During 1919, 548 schools were visited by our school nurses and 14,926 pupils inspected. Surprisingly few children were found free from any defect. The homes of children were visited in 325 cases. Sixty meetings were addressed and fifty school fairs attended. A course in health education was included in the curriculum of the Summer School for teachers at the University. Cadet Organisation. — The number of cadets in the province at the end of the cadet year, i.e., August 31, 1919, was 3,165. Efficiency prizes were awarded by the local committee of the Strathcona Trust for Saskatchewan to the following fifteen cadet corps in order of merit: Seniors. — Saskatoon Collegiate Institute C.C. No. 328. Prince Albert High School C.C. No. 390. Regina Collegiate Institute C.C. No. 155. Moose Jaw Collegiate Institute C.C. No. 120. Melville High School C.C. No. 464. 20 Department of Education Juniors. — “E” Christ Church C.C. Saskatoon No. 25. Moose Jaw Public Schools C.C. No. 422. Regina Public Schools C.C. No. 321. Prince Albert Public Schools C.C. No. 459. North Battleford (King’s) C.C. No. 652. Maple Creek C.C. No. 463. Rosetown C.C. No. 504. Lloydminster C.C. No. 172. Areola C.C. No. 519. Rouleau C.C. No. 472. New corps were organised at Turtleford, Colonsay, Carlyle, Fleming, Conquest, Unity, Luseland, Kerrobert, Saskatoon (Separ- ate Schools), Wolseley, Kisbey and Davidson. Cadet camps were held by the following corps: Maple Creek No. 463; Rosthern No. 462; Lloydminster No. 172; St. Barnabas Mission No. 764; St. George’s Church, “G” Coy, Saskatoon, No. 25; Christ Church, “E” Coy, Saskatoon, No. 25; Regina Separate Schools C. C. Nos. 755, 593 and 754; Areola No. 519; Stoughton No. 230; Biggar No. 586 and Macklin No. 582. Cadets from the following corps attended Boy Scout camps in 1919: Melville No. 464, Lebret No. 343, Qu’Appelle No. 669, Grenfell No. 143 and Regina Public Schools No. 321. Seventeen corps were not active in 1919 but six of these were undergoing re-organisation at the end of the year. In the silver medal rifle shooting competition, the Regina Collegiate Institute Cadet Corps, No. 155, with a score of 342 out of a possible 350, were the winners among the senior cadet corps of the province. The silver medal will be awarded to one of the following cadets, each of whom obtained the possible score of 35: J. 0. Mollard, H. J. French, H. Vernon, W. A. Wood and H. Wright. The competition among the junior corps was won by the Big River Cadet Corps No. 606 with a score of 290. The silver medal will be presented either to Florian Durand or to Elmer Kennedy, both having obtained the highest score of their team, namely, 32. Inspection of Secondary Schools. — The rapid increase in the number of departments in our High -Schools and Collegiate Insti- tutes and the necessity for more frequent inspection of this phase of public educational work made the appointment of an Inspector of High Schools desirable. J. A. Snell, M.A., LL.D., for some years Principal of the Normal School at Saskatoon, was selected for this work, his place in the Normal School being taken by- Geo. M Weir, M.A., D.Paed. Annual Repobt, 1919 21 NEW LEGISLATION. The Technical Education Act. — A distinct advance was made in education by the introduction at the session of the Legislative Assembly which began November 27, 1919, of The Technical Education Act. This Act provides for day schools either having an independent organisation or constituted as a department of an existing educational institution for the purpose of training adolescents in industrial pursuits and for the duties of citizenship and for evening schools in which adolescents and adults might receive instruction in the various occupations. The establishment and management of such schools is placed in the hands of a voca- tional education committee appointed annually wherever such schools are instituted. This committee is composed of ten members, four nominated by the board of trustees — three being members thereof — three employers of labour nominated by the local civic council and three employees nominated by such local organisation as the board of trustees may determine. It is provided that the members of this committee be British subjects and resident rate- payers of the school district. The Act sets forth the powers of the committee and the method of its operation and provides for the apportionment by the Minister of any moneys available for the support of technical and vocational education under such regulations as may be approved by the Lieutenant Governor in| Council. The Education of Soldiers’ Dependent Children Act. — Generous provision was also made at the session mentioned above for the education of the children of deceased or disabled soldiers. Assis- tance is given to such when they have reached the age of sixteen years and have passed the Grade VIII examination or its equivalent and may be continued for a period of three years or until the child has obtained Junior Matriculation standing. The limit of assistance is $240 for the scholastic year of ten months. The administration of this Act is placed in the hands of a commission consisting of the Deputy Minister of Education as chairman, a person nominated annually by the Minister of Education and a person nominated annually by the executive committee of the Saskatchewan Command of the Great War Veterans Association. An Act for the Creation of Scholarships for Canadian Students in Paris. — Under this Act the Lieutenant Governor in Council is authorised to grant annually three scholarships of $1,200 each to such students or teachers, usually resident in Saskatchewan, as he may designate, for the purpose of assisting them to follow postgraduate courses of study in the city of Paris. Such scholar- ships shall be granted on such terms and conditions and under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. This Act is really the outcome of representations made by the general commissioner for Canada in Paris that the best war memorial to be raised in honour of Canadian soldiers who fell in France and Flanders would be the creation of a per- manent home in the capital of France for C anadian students. 22 Department of Education For the furtherance of this object it was necessary that scholarships be established by the various provinces of the Dominion as their annual contribution to the proposed foundation. The staff of the department has grown very rapidly in recent years. The inside staff at the close of the year numbered 78 and the outside staff (normal schools, inspectors and officials serving on the extension staffs in school agriculture, household science and school hygiene) numbered 77. These figures at the time you began your administration of the department were respectively 49 and 47. Departmental work, in order to economise time and labour and give prompt and effective service, is distributed in branches or sections each in charge of a head. Notwithstanding the rapid development of the system and the multiplication of officials most effective co-ordination in the work and co-operation of the staffs has uniformly prevailed and I wish to pay a tribute to the members thereof for their good service in the cause of public education. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Augustus H. Ball, Deputy Minister. 23 PART I STATISTICAL TABLES. PUBLIC AND SEPARATE SCHOOOLS. General Summary.

As in former years a Summer School designed to meet the needs of teachers who wished to improve their educational standing was held at the University of Saskatchewan. To accommodate teachers who were not free to take the full course of six weeks, the work was divided into quarters of three weeks’ duration, each complete in itself. The first and third quarters ran concurrently from July 2 to 21; the second and fourth quarters from July 21 to August 9. Teachers were expected, in so far as could be arranged, to take some part of the work in agriculture or household science with other special work on the programme. This year saw the largest attendance on record at the summer school. There were two types of course offered, one leading to a University Degree and the other intended to improve the standing of teachers actually engaged in teaching the prescribed course of study. For the first seventy-nine students registered and for the second seventy-seven, classified as follows: (i) Academic Classes.

McCann The work done in the academic classes was substantially the same as that done in corresponding classes in the regular academic year and was intended to be equivalent to it in educational value. Numbers of students are encouraged to proceed to their degrees by being enabled to start in the summer and almost all such students make up by their studies the difference between the work of a sum- Annual Report, 1919 39 mer class and that of the regular academic year. This matter has been considered in many other places where summer sessions are held and there seems to be no tendency to reduce the credit given for summer session classes. The work of the pedagogic classes was made as practical as possible. The course in agricultural science included study |of the following: roots, stems, leaves, flowers, seeds, soils, gophers, insects, plant prop"
