        "text": "Climate change is one of the world’s greatest challenges and a major one for the agricultural sector.\n\nGlobal warming is changing the planet’s weather patterns and average temperatures, which threatens to alter the land area suitable for agriculture and increase the spread of pests and diseases.\n\nAt the same time, feeding an estimated world population of 9 billion in 2050 will require 50% more agricultural production and 15% higher withdrawals of water.\n\nThere has never been a greater need for our sector to source and distribute our products reliably and responsibly, reduce the environmental impact of our activities and look for innovative solutions to the future of food.\n\nOur position as a leading merchant and processor presents both a responsibility and an opportunity when it comes to climate change.\n\nEngaging actively with farmers, suppliers and partners around the world, we influence and encourage them to adopt sustainable practices and reduce emissions.\n\nWe do this by:\n\nTraining farmers in sustainable techniques, and providing tools to help them adapt to a changing climate;\n\nWorking with freight industry partners to find efficient product shipping solutions, reducing emissions and costs;\n\nAdvancing toward zero deforestation targets within our palm oil and soy supply chains;\n\nPromoting sustainable practices throughout our commodity supply chains."
