Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy at Yorkton Municipal Airport is essentially constant during November, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 19, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 5% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed at Yorkton Municipal Airport is essentially constant during November, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on March 30, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.8 miles per hour, while on July 30, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during November is 11.1 miles per hour on November 9.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction at Yorkton Municipal Airport throughout November is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 40% on November 25.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season at Yorkton Municipal Airport typically lasts for 4.1 months (126 days), from around May 17 to around September 20, rarely starting before April 30 or after June 3, and rarely ending before September 2 or after October 7.\n\nThe month of November at Yorkton Municipal Airport is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in November at Yorkton Municipal Airport\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days at Yorkton Municipal Airport are essentially constant during November, remaining within 1Â°F of 1,639Â°F throughout.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy at Yorkton Municipal Airport is gradually decreasing during November, falling by 0.8 kWh, from 1.8 kWh to 1.0 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in November at Yorkton Municipal Airport\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in November at Yorkton Municipal AirportNov1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292930300.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWhOctDecNov 11.8 kWhNov 11.8 kWhNov 301.0 kWhNov 301.0 kWhNov 111.5 kWhNov 111.5 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Yorkton Municipal Airport are 51.265 deg latitude, -102.462 deg longitude, and 1,604 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Yorkton Municipal Airport is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 92 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,619 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (144 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,001 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Yorkton Municipal Airport is covered by cropland (99%), within 10 miles by cropland (90%), and within 50 miles by cropland (83%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather at Yorkton Municipal Airport, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nYorkton Municipal Airport has a weather station that reported reliably enough during the analysis period that we have included it in our network. When available, historical temperature and dew point measurements are taken directly from this weather station. These records are obtained from NOAA's Integrated Surface Hourly data set, falling back on ICAO METAR records as required.\n\nIn the case of missing or erroneous measurements from this station, we fall back on records from nearby stations, adjusted according to typical seasonal and diurnal intra-station differences. For a given day of the year and hour of the day, the fallback station is selected to minimize the prediction error over the years for which there are measurements for both stations.\n\nThe stations on which we may fall back include but are not limited to Broadview, Sask.; Roblin Man; Indian Head; Swan River, Man.; Hudson Bay Airport; Wynyard Marine Aviation Reporting Station; Shoal Lake Airport; and Regina.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
