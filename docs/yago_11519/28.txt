Theresa Lee "Terry" Farrell (born November 19, 1963) is an American former actress and fashion model. She is best known for her performances in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as Jadzia Dax, and in Becker as Regina Kostas.

Farrell is the daughter of Kay Carol Christine (Bendickson) and Edwin Francis Farrell, Jr. Later, her mother married David W. Grussendorf, who adopted Terry and her sister, Christine. In 1978, she left her hometown for a summer in Mexico City as a foreign exchange student. She has since been fond of big cities, so in her junior year of high school, the nearly six feet tall Farrell submitted her image to the Elite modeling agency in New York City. Shortly after, at the age of 16, she was summoned to New York City and, within two days of arriving, had an exclusive contract with Mademoiselle.

Farrell has retired from acting to concentrate on her family. She lives in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with her husband, former Sprint Corporation spokesman Brian Baker (a.k.a. the Sprint Guy) and their son. She enjoys sewing and yoga. Farrell has appeared with her husband at the Hershey Area Playhouse in Hershey, Pennsylvania, in a production of A. R. Gurney's Love Letters. In 2011 interview, she said Michael Dorn and she have always been good friends.
