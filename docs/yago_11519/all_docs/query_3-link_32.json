        "text": "If you're a co-star of a sitcom, kissing the title character can prove fatal to your series health.\n\nThat's the lesson learned by Terry Farrell, fired from her Becker role just after the Monday-night CBS comedy's season finale aired. Her character, diner owner Reggie, finally kissed cranky doctor Becker (Ted Danson) after he showed interest in a lively neighbor (Nancy Travis). It was left a cliffhanger at the time, but Farrell knows the outcome _ for her, anyway _ since she won't even be returning to wrap up that story line.\n\nThe firing came \"completely\" as a surprise, Farrell says. \"I've been trying to adjust to the shock of it, quite honestly. It's hard not to take it a little personally, for someone to say, \"You did a great job, but we don't need you anymore.' Especially with the last three stories (when Reggie's feelings for Becker intensified), you could only think, \"This has to be a really bad joke. After 94 episodes, I don't understand.' \"\n\nFarrell adds, \"I was originally told that the very last scene of the very last episode of Becker would be Becker and Reggie going on their first date, but that was a long time ago. I learned from doing earlier series that so many things are beyond your control, you shouldn't waste time thinking or worrying about them. All you can do is to do your best job and hope people like it.\"\n\nRight now, the actor's life does have a couple of silver linings. The former model and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine veteran has just gotten engaged to actor Brian Baker and she stars as a high school basketball coach in tonight's Lifetime movie Crossing the Line at 9 p.m.\n\n_ Times wires"
