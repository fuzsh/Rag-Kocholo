        "text": "Considering she left two large roles, in two separate shows, prematurely ... I'm thinking Farrell may be what they call \"difficult\". One show? It happens - maybe it really was a creative decision. Two? No.\n\nMargaret was the librarian on the Electric Company. The \"of\" should be \"off\" you 'mos are pretty stupid to not be able to cope with a typo.\n\nNo wonder liberals are in such a mess.\n\n[quote] The \"of\" should be \"off\" you 'mos are pretty stupid to not be able to cope with a typo.\n\nYou say typo. We say ignorant and illiterate or sloppy and lazy.\n\nI'm sure the truth is somewhere in the middle.\n\nWow. I just looked her up. Hasn't worked since 2003 per IMDB. Just had a project this year, \"Renegades\" which states:\n\nRenegades is an independently fan funded sci-fi web series, executive produced by Sky Conway.\n\nUgh. I actually feel bad for her now. Hope she cashed in on that Star Trek money while she could.\n\nr1 from the link\n\n[quote]What happened with Terry Farrell on Becker?...One story I've heard is that...\n\nIt gives a theory of why. The OP asked WHAT HAPPENED not, a guess, which is wrong\n\nCreator and EP David Hackel and Farrell have both stated that it had nothing to do with Farrell supporting the cast in claims for a promised pay rise after season three which contradicts the link.\n\nCan you not read r15?\n\nIn the link at r1 someone on Ken Levine's blog (head writer for Mash, Cheers) asking the question about what happened to Terry Farrell on Becker and saying that he heard she was fired. David Hackel, the show runner you mention, then answers the question himself saying it had nothing to do with contract negotiations and she was in fact a lovely person and great actress who was just written out of the show after the fourth season because they thought that was best for the storyline of the show.\n\nFarrell wasn't fired from Star Trek, so I don't think it was that she was difficult. She decided not to sign a new contract for DS9 season 7, but she did offer to do recurring guest spots. They didn't like that idea, so they just killed her off instead.\n\nShortly after she was written off Becker, she decided to retire from acting. The two recent projects on her imdb are just Star Trek related roles that she probably did for fun."
