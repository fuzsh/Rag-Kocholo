        "text": "Terry Farrell, renowned for her portrayal of Jadzia Dax in “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,” has left an indelible mark on the world of science fiction.\n\nWith a career spanning various roles in film and television, including “Hellraiser 3” and “Becker,” her sudden departure from the acting scene left many fans wondering what happened to this beloved actress.\n\nAs the 30th anniversary of “Deep Space Nine” approaches, the curiosity about Farrell’s life post-Star Trek has only grown. In this article, we’ll explore what ever happened to Terry Farrell, delving into her decision to leave acting, her current pursuits, and how she continues to connect with her fans.\n\nWhether you’re a die-hard Trekkie or simply intrigued by the journey of a talented actress, join us as we uncover the story behind Farrell’s transition from the starship to a new adventure.\n\nBackground Info\n\nTheresa Lee Farrell was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on November 18th, 1963. This 5’ 11¾” (1.82 m) actress and model was active from 1983 to 2003 and, following retirement, returned to acting in 2017. She is best known for her role as Jadzia Dax in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nShe is one of five siblings, two older sisters and two younger sisters, making her the middle child. She was born to Kay Carol Christine Bendickson and Edwin Frances Farrell, Jr. She has five nephews and four nieces.\n\nAt age 15, she became a foreign exchange student in Mexico, giving her a sense of adventure she would try to replicate throughout her life.\n\nModeling\n\nBy age 17, she had dropped out of high school to enter the world of modeling in New York with the Elite modeling agency. Shortly after, she landed an exclusive contract with Mademoiselle and would appear in German and Italian additions of Vogue and editorials in American Vogue.\n\nAfter three years of modeling, however, she turned her attention toward a career as an actor.\n\nTerry Farrell’s Early Career\n\nFollowing a modeling career where she studied acting on the side, she took a role in the 1984 television series, Paper Dolls, drawing from her modeling experience.\n\nThe show was a soap opera focused on the New York fashion industry and appeared to be a great project based on her experiences. However, the show only ran for 14 episodes.\n\nShe landed her first film role in 1986 in the Rodney Dangerfield comedy Back to School. She played college student Valerie Desmond.\n\nFollowing these two notable roles, she would find herself in various film and television projects, including the horror sequel Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth (1992) and on episodes of The Twilight Zone (1986) and Family Ties (1986).\n\nIn 1992 she would appear in an episode of Quantum Leap; that same year, she would star as Cat in the pilot of the cult sci-fi series Red Dwarf.\n\nHowever, these brushes with sci-fi success would pay off when she was cast in the Star Trek series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, appearing in 148 episodes from 1993 to 1998.\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine\n\nShe would play the Trill character Jadzia Dax, a symbiont composed of two in a single, conscious mind.\n\nMany fans of Deep Space Nine consider Jadzia Dax to have been an underutilized character due to her ability to explore themes of gender fluidity, bisexuality, and non-binary gender identity.\n\nIn addition, she also represented ideas of multiple personalities within a single character and was a trailblazing figure at the time.\n\nJadzia Dax served as the station’s chief science officer and was close friends with commander Benjamin Sisko.\n\nJadzia Dax would eventually marry the Klingon character Worf during the show’s sixth season, but in the season finale, Jadzia died.\n\nTerry Farrell left the show, and a new Trill symbiote was introduced in season seven with Ezri Dax, played by Nicole de Boer.\n\nWhy did she leave Star Trek: Deep Space Nine?\n\nJadzia Dax proved to be a popular character with fans of the show but a challenging one for the writers to characterize because of the multiple personalities inherent in the Trill species. By season two, however, the writers had a lock on the character.\n\nAll seemed to be going well until the sixth season of the show. Farrell was offered a chance to join the sitcom, Becker.\n\nShe passed on renewing her contract and joined Becker for four years as Reggie Costas.\n\nTerry revealed she had conflicts with Star Trek producer Rick Berman and attempted to stay on the show with fewer appearances, but he refused.\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine, In Retrospect\n\nTerry reveals that one of her favorite episodes of DS9 is ‘Blood Oath‘. In the episode, Dax joins three Klingon warriors in completing a vendetta.\n\nTerry mentions that she enjoyed the episode because she got to explore the tomboy side of her character and she also felt an sense of equality among the Klington.\n\nShe also mentions that she enjoyed any episodes where they explore bigger social issues. For instance, her relationship with Wharf, which explored inter-species romance on the show and interracial romance in real life.\n\nOne of the story lines on the show that she disliked, involved her character constantly wanting to know who Kira Nerys was dating. Terry mentions that it was out of character and un-evolved for a 350 year old Trill. She said it was a wasted opportunity for two strong women to do something empowering and interesting, instead of gossipy.\n\nWhen asked about what the best part about being a Star Trek cast member is, Terry says that it feels like you are a lifetime member of a family. A family that is welcoming and supportive of all members, old and new. A family that doesn’t distinguish between television or movies. Everyone is apart of the same family and world and she says that is an amazing feeling.\n\nWhat is Terry Farrell doing now?\n\nTerry Farrell quit acting to become an at-home mom, a role she has embraced for the last 19 years.\n\nShe has also been participating in Comic Cons and engaging with fans, especially as “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” celebrates its 30th anniversary. Farrell also has an account on Cameo to record videos for fans at reasonable rates.\n\nShe purchased a small house in New Mexico, where she is an hour and a half drive from her parents\n\nIn 2023, she will be apart of the Star Trek Cruise, alongside her DS9 cast mates, Nana Visitor, Cirroc Lofton, Nicole De Boer, as well as other notable Stark Trek alum.\n\nWhile not something she did in particular, a fan of Star Trek, William Kwong Yu Yeung, an astronomer, named two asteroids in our solar system after her and her Star Trek co-star Nana Visitor in 2001.\n\nIn her free time Terry likes to quilt. She says she picked up the hobby to fill the time while filming Deep Space Nine.\n\nFamily\n\nTerry Farrell has been married twice. Her first marriage was to actor Brian Baker. Their married spanned from September 2002 to December 2015, ending in a divorce. They had one child together.\n\nTerry Farrell’s second marriage was to director Adam Nimoy, the son of the late Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy. Terry Farrell and Adam Nimoy married in March 2018 and are still together.\n\nTerry Farrell has one child. Her son Max Baker was born in 2003 while she was married to actor Brian Baker.\n\nIs Terry Farrell on social media?"
