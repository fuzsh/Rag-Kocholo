Terry graciously consented to an interview with The Thunder Child, which you can read here: http://thethunderchild.com/Theatre/FarrellLoveLetters.html\n\nNote: It’s about her life now, with only a couple of questions about DS9, but it’s a fun read. And if you go see the play, make sure you tell her you read about it in The Thunder Child!”"
