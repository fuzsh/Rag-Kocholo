My grandmother made me a\n\nTRIBBLE. I can still see myself by my Elton John toe socks.'\"\n\n--_Celebrity Sleuth_\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Though Farrell was a big fan of the original 'Star Trek' series growing up, she\n\nknew little about 'The Next Generation before entering the 'Trek' universe\n\nherself. 'I used to watch the original 'Star Trek' all the time when I was a\n\nlittle kid. I remember my grandmother made me a Tribble, which I kept by my\n\nTV in my room. But I had only watched 'The Next Generation' a couple of\n\ntimes,' she admits. 'I really dont' watch that much TV in general. Now, I've\n\nmade it a point to watch 'Next Generation' more often.'\"\n\n--Ian Spelling, _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Official Magazine_\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"...her father left her when she was young and died a few years later. Her\n\nmother later re-married.\"\n\n--Jason P. Heym\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"She is from my hometown and went to my high school: George Washington Senior\n\nHigh School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I think she would have been a senior when\n\nI was a sophomore (I'm class of '85) but she left school before her senior\n\nyear to go to New York to model. I never met her but I remember someone put\n\nher picture up in the office as one of those 'local kid does good' items.\n\nAnyway, since it's not very often someone from CR (or at least attended some\n\nhigh school there) gets famous so I thought I would share my limited info.\"\n\n--Alice Cramer\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"At George Washington Senior High School she was called the 'stringed bean.'\"\n\n\"She started her career climb by winning the Miss photogenic award in some Iowa\n\nbeauty pageant. An amateur photographer took some shots and sent them to New\n\nYork. An Elite? Modeling agency woman came out to check her out. After this\n\nnews made the local (school?) newspaper, all of her friends instantly became\n\njealous. After all, they considered her to be the most awkward looking\n\ncreature at her school. She once had ears that came straight out of her\n\nhead... Her mother even called her Dumbo for her ears. 'They used to catch a\n\nlot of wind,' she said. Then she had some ear-retraction surgery at 18 to fix\n\nthat.\"\n\n--Jason P. Heym\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"...began her career as a fashion model. During her two-and-a-half year stint\n\nbefore photographer's cameras, Farrell graced the covers of such renowned\n\nmagazines as _Vogue_ and _Mademoiselle_, among others. At the same time, she\n\nstudied acting in both New York and Los Angeles.\"\n\n--Ian Spelling, _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Offical Magazine_\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"'Picture this,' reported one tabloid in May 1990. 'Movie tough guy Mickey\n\nRourke actually got on BENDED KNEES in front of nearly 50 people in gal pal\n\nTerry Farrell's acting class--then he asked her to MARRY him! A shocked Terry\n\nsaid, 'Yes,' and the couple got a standing ovation.' Hold the applause! Less\n\nthan a MONTH later, another tabloid offered the following tidbit: 'Mickey\n\nRouke's EX-girlfriend Terry Farrell (who gave up her career to wait for him)\n\nis getting back in circulation. She MOVED IN with Tom Cruise's ex, Mimi\n\nRogers.'\"\n\n--_Celebrity Sleuth_\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"In the early 1980's...Terry was sitting in a restaurant when a waitress mistook\n\nher for Brooke Shields.\"\n\n\"...she was raised on a red meat and milk (it did her body good) diet. After\n\nmoving up, she switched to plain yogurt and rice cakes (too bad).\"\n\n--Jason P. Heym\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Terry Farrell knew Michael Dorn and had worked with Jonathan Frakes nearly a\n\ndecade ago. She and Marina Sirtis had a mutual friend. So, it seemed only\n\nnatural that Farrell would one day wind up before the 'Star Trek' cameras.\"\n\n\"In fact, Farrell spent so much time over on the 'Next Generation soundstages,\n\nwhile filming several audition s for 'Deep Space Nine's' producers, that the\n\nactress befriended virtually the entire cast. 'I would be talking with\n\nJonathan by his trailer when Patrick [Stewart] or Brent [Spiner] would come\n\nby, so we would all talk. I met LeVar [Burton] and we talked for a while,\n\ntoo. He let me ride his bicycle around the lot,' says the actress. 'I just\n\nwent to his wedding, which was great. 'The Next Generation' and 'Deep Space\n\nnine' stages are right by each other, and because we have to spend so many\n\nhours on the lot and the casts are around each other so much, the process of\n\ngetting to know people was really accelerated.'\"\n\n--Ian Spelling, _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Official Magazine_\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"I think the word to describe her is wholesome.\"\n\n\"...she said that 'The only thing I had in common with my boyfriends was green\n\neyes.'\"\n\n--Jason P. Heym\n\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\n\nMODELING\n\nFormat...Sponsor/_Magazine Title_ (Year):\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKool cigarettes (19??):\n\n\"I can't believe you don't have her as the 'Kool girl'. That is, she is the\n\ngirl (one of them at least) in the Kool cigarette print ads. And yes, I am\n\nsure about this (a few years ago).\"\n\n--Chris J. Wein\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Mademoiselle_ and _Vogue_ (19??):\n\n\"...'supermodel' Terry has been on the cover of both VOGUE and MADEMOISELLE.\"\n\n--Dean Adams\n\n\"A photograph of such a _Mademoiselle_ cover can be seen in _Celebrity Sleuth_,\n\nVolume 7 Number 4.\" [See below under MAGAZINES]\n\n--Jeffrey Koga [ed.]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVirginia Slims cigarettes (1991):\n\n\"I digged through some old Entertainment Weekly mags dating back to 1991 and was\n\nsurprised to find Terry Farrell in a number of Virginia Slims ads...most\n\nnotably, the one where she is dressed as Napoleon (\"Ever wonder what history\n\nwould be like if it was herstory?\") Since I remember that ad very well, I was\n\nsurprised I never made the retro-connection to Farrell until seeing it again.\"\n\n--Michael Butler\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEstee Lauder (1992):\n\n\"I found a two-page spread of an Estee Lauder ad in a Vogue magazine with Terry\n\nFarrell in it, from about a year ago. Somebody on the net claimed that only\n\none woman -- not our T.F -- models for Estee Lauder and therefore it couldn't\n\nbe Terry. I don't buy that. I'm looking at the picture right now and this\n\nwoman looks just like Dax, only she has more makeup, less clothing, and no\n\nTrill spots. Even the dopey hairstyle is the same. And the same serene\n\nexpression on her face, too. If this ain't Dax, it has to be her evil twin\n\nsister! (for reference, the ad is a photograph of a woman wearing brown\n\ngossamer silk sitting on a dock in a tropical setting).\"\n\n--Diane Westerfield\n\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\n\nMAGAZINES\n\nFormat..._Title_ (Month Year, Volume Number, Issue Number, page numbers):\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Celebrity Sleuth_ (\"Women of Fantasy #5\", Volume 7 Number 4):\n\n\"Celebrity Sleuth is an overpriced magazine dedicated to printing nude photos of\n\ncelebrities.\"\n\n--Otto \"Hack-Man\" Heuer\n\n\"...a magazine dedicated to provided rare shots of celebrities.

This show is the second spin-off of a\n\nlegend I watched when I was a kid.' It's really a living legend. I can't\n\nwait. 'Star Trek' is such an optimistic view of what the world could be like\n\nin the future. People aren't prejudiced. They love each other for what's\n\ngoing on inside. They try to deal as best they can with problems going on\n\noutside. That is very optimistic, and it should be that way now. 'Star Trek'\n\nsays, 'Hey! We're going to be here in the 24th Century and we'll be getting\n\nalong and we'll be doing exciting things.' People are excited by that. I\n\nknow I am.'\"\n\n--Ian Spelling, _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Official Magazine_\n\n\"Notable episodes include the following...\n\nFirst season\n\n'The Emissary': Jadzia Dax's introduction!\n\n'Dax': Jadzia is placed on trial for the alleged murder, by Curzon, of\n\nTandro's father 30 years ago.\n\nSecond season\n\n'Invasive Procedures': Dax is stolen from Jadzia and is placed into Verad, a\n\ndispossessed and rejected Trill host.\n\n'Melora': Dax and Melora discuss love in Starfleet.\n\n'Playing God': Dax trains Arjin, an arrogant Trill applicant. Includes the\n\ninfamous shower scene!\n\n'Blood Oath': Jadzia is reunited, by a blood oath, with Kang, Koloth, and Kor,\n\nfor one final battle against The Albino.\"\n\n--Jeffrey Koga [ed.]\n\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\n\nFAN LETTER\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"They (I say 'they' because it had to be some mindless fan-mail factory)\n\nbasically took my name and address, computer-printed an address label, and\n\nstuck it on what I am guessing was a pre-made pack of essentially nothing.\n\nThe aforementioned form letter (on personalized stationery), replee with\n\nxeroxed signature (i.e. fake) and typos; and a pretty disappointing black and\n\nwhite photo (8x10 I think) -- the autograph on it is as 'authentic' as that\n\non the letter, and she ain't even smiling. Not even a little.\n\nI have no idea if this is the typical stuff fans receive from 'her', so I'm not\n\ngoing to pass judgement.\n\nIf so, I *would* like to save others from wasting their time as I did, but quite\n\nfrankly it's almost embarassing admitting I got blown off like this. Ack!\n\nSince I don't really know what 'she' replies with, I don't want to set off any\n\nfalse alarms.\n\nConsidering I mailed my letter on the last day of January, and I received this\n\none last week, I think the whole thing's rather pathetic, don't you? Of\n\ncourse she's a big star, but c'mon - she's not *that* big. I suppose I was\n\nexpecting *someone* to at least read what I wrote... Was I wrong in assumingi\n\nTrek stars acted differently from other big-time Hollywood punks? ACK!\n\nPardon me, I need a drink. The flames are scorching my $!*%*&(@ mouth. :-[\n\nMake no mistake - I'm still a big fan, just a bit ticked-off.\"\n\n--Benjamin A.

Dax is an alien known\n\nas a Trill, a joined species compriesd of two seaparte but interdependent\n\nentities: a host and a symobiont. While her 28-year old body serves as a\n\nhost, the symbiont that lives insider her is a 300-year old life form that\n\nlooks like a short, fat snake. Dax therefore possesses the wisdom and\n\nknowledge from six lifetimes of experience.\"\n\n--From the bookmark text\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCreation Convention--Various Jadzia Dax 8\"x10\" color glossy photographs ($5.00\n\neach):\n\nTo date, there are only four that feature just Dax:\n\n1) First season publicity photo. A head and shoulders shot, with her head\n\ntilted slightly to her left, against a yellowish background. Slight\n\nsmile.\n\n[This is my personal favorite]\n\n2) First season photo. A head and shoulders shot of her sitting at her\n\nconsole at Ops on DS9. Slight smile.\n\n3) First season photo from \"A Man Alone\". A medium shot of her standing\n\nbehind Ibudan's clone in the tank. She is smiling broadly.\n\n4) Second season publicity photo.
