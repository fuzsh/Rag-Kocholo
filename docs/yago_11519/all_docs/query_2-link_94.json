        "text": "Go on, be honest – in quiet moment sat in front of your laptop or tablet, have you ever tried to Google yourself? Yes, of course you have!\n\nClick on images and the news tab on Google, and it swiftly unravels a gallery of horrors of notorious namesakes, in my case, with various criminal convictions!\n\nAnd that’s the beauty of Google. Back in the computerless Dark Ages when I entered the grey world of work, if you wanted to find out something, you’d grab a file or research the Encyclopedia Britannica! Now, the world is your oyster with a few well-chosen search words.\n\nWith Search Engine Optimization, those key words are crucial towards optimizing your website to get the best organic traffic from the search engine results page.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nI may only be 21 – okay double that and add on a few large whiskies – but I’ve been called a fair few names in my lifetime. The polite ones are: Vic, Vix, Vicky and Victoria. And I’m asked why I have 4 surnames too – Butcher, Kilburn, Cameron and now O’Farrell.\n\nYour name is your brand. For several years, letters would drop on the doormat addressed Victoria Cameron. Type that into Google, and the SEO was rubbish. Up flooded sylph-like images of Victoria Beckham, Cameron Diaz and Queen Victoria (only kidding with the last one!).\n\nSo your NAME is important SEO. So what’s your best “googleable” name?\n\n1.How do you feel when others shorten you name?\n\nBefore social media, other people would offend you shortening my name. My name is Vicky but if someone whom I’d never met address me as “Vic or Vix” my brain would think, “oh hold on, sorry but that’s the name close friends and family call me, i’ve never met you”\n\nHowever, when I first signed up for twitter there was a character restriction of 140, each letter had to be of value, therefore Vic was unleashed to the world.\n\n2. Do your Social Media names match?\n\nMine don’t - LinkedIn and FaceBook are Vicky but Instagram and twitter are both Vic - how does this effect when people search fo me by name? LinkedIn had been Victoria, but really no-one still uses that. Now social media is not my area of expertise so please feel free to comment below on what we should do. However, in understanding more about the importance of hashtags, my usernames @ are still vic, but the display names are now #PersonalityVic - this is me, it’s also what I am all about.\n\n3. When you’ve changed your surname too!\n\nWithout trying to trump Elizabeth Taylor, i’ve had 4 Surnames, so what if someone who knew me before marriage was searching for that name? Born Victoria Helen Butcher, called Vicky most of my life until 1st married - and my name changed to Victoria Kilburn - for no “snob” factor but purely because Vicky Kilburn had too many K’s in the middle and people would often miss hear me. The funniest ever was buying a train tickets once and the recipient thought I wanted the tube from Victoria to Kilburn 🤦🏻‍♀️. So why 4 Surnames…point 4 👇\n\n4. Don’t give me a nickname I don’t like.\n\nHaving lived 22 years happily as Vicky Butcher, along came Eastenders, now for those who have never watched Eastenders, there was a character called Ricky Butcher, who first appeared in May 1988 (i was just 17), which was all fine, no relevance, carry on as normal. However, in November 1993 the character Bianca appeared and over the years “Ricky” and the way she shouted it grated on me because people started calling me “vicky” in the same tone. The hadn’t change my name, so not a nickname as such but the TONE just grated me. So when I divorced in 2005, the name “Ricky / Vicky Butcher” was not to return. Welcome Vic, Vicky, Victoria Cameron, my wee Scottish Granny’s maiden name, adopted by me because I loved it and her.\n\n5. How many different ways can you spell and say my name?\n\nYou’d think Vicky was an easy name to say, and it is, but as for the spelling, there are many, Vicki, Vikki, Vickie, Vickey, Vici, etc - it’s another reason on social media and email, I am VIC, thats with a C at the end because K is not even in Victoria, just remove the “toria”. I was once asked to spell my name Cameron and said “as in David” - who, at the time, was our Prime Minister, it was retuned with “David who?” Now as for the apostrophe in my surname now, the log-in, the username - please don’t tell me ‘ is a special character that can not use - it’s part of my NAME, it’s not a special character @£$%^&*() these are special characters.\n\nSo why write this article?\n\nDo you check you name online - you should - has anyone tried to set up a fake account with your name?\n\nHow do people find you?\n\nWhats you biggest bug-bear in names ?\n\nIt all comes back to whether your name has the right SEO traction."
