        "text": "A Few Monday Musings\n\nFirst, the BIG NEWS- I am a grandfather! My daughter Taylor gave birth to a beautiful baby girl last Friday, Melina Vess Marie Ferguson entered the world at 12:07PM weighing in at 8 LBS & 10 OZs. She promptly stole our hearts. And I’m filled with pride watching my daughter, she is already a fantastic […]\n\nPosted in: Uncategorized\n\nA Few Sunday Musings\n\nBilly Bob Thornton played my hometown last night and I didn’t go dammit. If you didn’t know it, Billy Bob isn’t just an Academy Award winning actor, he is also a musician and songwriter with his own band, The Boxmasters. Their music has a 50’s country kinda vibe, like Hank Williams Sr or Johnny Horton. […]\n\nPosted in: Uncategorized\n\nDeadly Dentist: Trophy Hunting Cecil\n\nTrophy hunting, I just don’t get it. I’m not against hunting, quite the opposite in fact. I grew up in a house where venison often graced the table. Whitetail deer, killed and ‘dressed’ by my grandfather in our front yard, it was a regular part of my diet growing up and though it’s not a […]\n\nPosted in: Uncategorized\n\nVarious States of The Union\n\nWhile watching the State of the Union speech it hit me; the reason politicians always seem so out of touch; it’s because they only interact with perfect people, Uber-Americans if you will. Whenever politicians give BIG speeches, your states of the union, state, city, etc., at your campaign announcements, basically any speech that’s called an […]\n\nPosted in: Uncategorized\n\nWho Turned off the Sun?\n\n‘Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy…’ – John Denver The weather in the waning days of 2014 and the beginning of this brand-new year has sucked the life right out of me. Seriously, it feels like the rain and grey skies have become vampires, only instead of blood, these vampires drain energy, the will […]\n\nPosted in: Uncategorized\n\nAdmonishing Batman\n\nBatman lives in my house. Not Bruce Wayne of DC Comic, Adam West/Micheal Keaton/Christian Bale/Ben Affleck fame (no disrespect George Clooney/Val Kilmer). No, this Batman is a dog, the son of my Chihuahua Coco. Let’s call it a youthful indiscretion on her part. I call it that because it sounds better than admitting the truth; […]\n\nPosted in: Uncategorized\n\nOn the Moon Griffon Show 12/27/13\n\nhttp://goo.gl/DAtSq4 Yesterday I appeared on the Moon Griffon Show to talk Duck Dynasty and my perspective on getting fired from a television job for something I said. Please give it a listen, I’m in the first two segments only but feel free of course to enjoy the entire two hour show. Thanks to my friend […]\n\nPosted in: Uncategorized"
