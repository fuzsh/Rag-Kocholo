        "text": "Congratulations are in order for two members of the Star Trek family. Over the weekend Star Trek: Deep Space Nine star Terry Farrell confirmed that she was engaged to be married to Adam Nimoy, son of Star Trek legend Leonard Nimoy. The news first came via Access Hollywood’s Scott Mantz and was confirmed by Terry via Twitter.\n\nOver the weekend Adam and Terry expressed thanks on behalf of the couple to the well wishing they had received, including some from Star Trek: Voyager’s Jeri Ryan.\n\nThe pair have been dating since last year. In fact, Terry joined Adam on his media tour for his film For the Love of Spock in 2016.\n\nEarlier this month in Las Vegas the pair showed off their chemistry at Star Trek Las Vegas when Adam was the surprise moderator for Terry’s panel.\n\nThere is no word yet on when or where the pair plan on tying the knot, but there is a good chance some Star Trek royalty will be on hand to wish the couple well.\n\nAwkward?\n\nOf course some fans have noted that there may be a bit of awkwardness due to a scene in the DS9 episode “Trials and Tribble-ations” when the crew traveled back in time to the era of the original Star Trek and while there Jadzia expressed her attraction to Spock, played by Adam’s father.\n\n…but apparently the couple has moved past this.\n\nRegardless TrekMovie expresses our congratulations to the happy couple."
