        "text": "Sam leaps into Al himself, as a young ensign in the US Navy, shortly after he’s been accused of the rape and murder of the wife of a senior officer. Without knowing the implications of what he is doing, Sam convinces Al’s girlfriend–a married nurse named Lisa–to not testify on his behalf, and thus to not ruin her marriage or reputation. Lisa however dies shortly afterward in a car accident (as she was originally fated to do) which means young Al has no alibi for the crime and becomes fated to be executed as a result. Sam eventually discovers that one of Al’s fellow seamen is responsible for the crime, which was committed in a drunken fit. Sam figures out a way to have young Al, from the future, leapt back in time into himself, shortly before the crime. This allows young Al to prevent the murder, which has the spill-on effect of preventing Lisa’s death.\n\nContinue reading Quantum Leap – A Leap for Lisa [4.22]\n\nMy daughters and I are making our way through Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (having finished Voyager a little while ago) and are early in the third season now, having just watched the episode Equilibrium, an episode which focuses on Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), a Trill officer on board the space station.\n\n(Daily Doctor Who #152)\n\nContinue reading Star Trek Deep Space 9: Equilibrium – Some Casual Thoughts"
