        "text": "Yep. She's a stay at home mom. Besides, her husband is making a mint in those Verizon commercials.\n\nHe was in Sprint commercials, not Verizon.\n\nThey rip people off all the same!\n\nI wish she would get back into acting! I always liked her on DS9 (yes, I know that puts me in the minority...).\n\nNo it doesn't. I liked her too.\n\nSure, I LOVED Ezri, and she made me wish Jadzia was never there, but I liked Jadzia too.\n\nI HATED Terry Farrell and Jadzia Dax... HATED it. I was SOOOOOOO happy when she left.\n\nThe worst character (& performance) ever! I couldn't swallow one more second of her low-talk performance. She looked and talked like she just woke up after a night of binge drinking.\n\nHer whole strategy at playing someone old & wise (which the Dax symbiant is supposed to be) was to talk really quietly and hold her hands behind her back.\n\nAghhh! Just remembering those scenes in which she \"fight\" Klingons and is supposed to be a good fighter, yet she still can't raise her voice and goes back to the quiet-talk just drives me maaaad!\n\nWell I found the character and concept behind her species very interesting. I enjoyed her care-free personality and her desire to indulge herself in things that younger minds wouldn't consider since she has accomplished and experienced so much in her 300+ years in existance. I liked her friendship with Sisko, specifically because he knew her as a man and she no doubt knows things about him that only male friends would share with one another! Terry Farrell did a fine job in the role, and handled many intensive scenes brilliantly, especially in 'Rejoined' for example.\n\nTrue that. Not too long ago, I had a chance to talk with the older sister of a friend I grew up with - many years ago, and she was still as beautiful as I remember her from my days of infatuated youth.\n\nI think Hillary Clinton proves the point as well. More attractive now, than then.\n\nBTW, isn't there a movie just out featuring several 'older' women?\n\nYep. She's a stay at home mom. Besides, her husband is making a mint in those Verizon commercials.\n\nHe was in Sprint commercials, not Verizon.\n\nRight, Sprint. I keep mixing them up.\n\nGorgeous.\n\nWow, that's the highlight of my day. This had to have been taken some years ago though. She didn't really look that hot anymore on the special features for the ds9 dvds and that was what 2002 or 2003?"
