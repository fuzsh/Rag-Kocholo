        "text": "Terry Farrell is an American former actress and fashion model. She is perhaps best known for her performances in the television series \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" as Jadzia Dax and \"Becker\" as Regina Kostas.\n\nAfter 18 months of modeling, she studied acting with Kate McGregor Stewart while still modeling on the side. Her first major roles were in the short-lived 1983 television series \"Paper Dolls\" playing a model and in the feature film \"Back to School\" with Rodney Dangerfield. In the spring of 1989, she began studying acting with Stella Adler and appeared in a number of guest-starring roles in series like \"Quantum Leap\" and \"The Cosby Show.\"\n\nShe was then offered a lead role in \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\" Farrell starred as Jadzia Dax, the space station's Starfleet science officer; a character from an alien species known as the Trill, who is host to a 300-year-old symbiont and can draw upon the memories and knowledge of the symbiont's seven previous hosts.\n\nFarrell then co-starred on Paramount's television comedy series \"Becker.\" She played Regina \"Reggie\" Kostas, foil and love interest to Ted Danson's John Becker, for four years and 94 episodes, before she was replaced by Nancy Travis.\n\nFarrell also provided the voice of Six of One in the animated short film \"Tripping the Rift,\" which eventually became a Sci-Fi Channel TV series with other actors providing the voice of Six. First released independently on the Internet, \"Tripping the Rift\" originally featured Patricia Beckmann as the voice of Six and was replaced by Farrell's voice for an episode of the Sci-Fi Channel's short film series \"Exposure,\" in which Farrell was guest host.\n\nFarrell lives in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with her husband, former Sprint Corporation spokesman Brian Baker (a.k.a. the Sprint Guy) and their son. She enjoys sewing and quilting."
