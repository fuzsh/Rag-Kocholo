        "text": "Origin\n\nFarrell : Irish: shortened Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Fearghail ‘descendant of Fearghal’ a personal name composed of the elements fear ‘man’ + gal ‘valor courage’.\n\nArrol : primarily a Lennox name this is more likely to be an anglicization of the Gaelic personal name Fearghal (and thus related to Irish Farrell) than to come from the place-name Errol (Perths).\n\nFairley : 1: Scottish: habitational name from any of several places called from Old English fæger ‘beautiful’ or fearn ‘fern’ + lēah ‘woodland clearing’. Primarily from Fairlie in Ayrshire but perhaps occasionally from other places similarly named such as Fairley (Northumberland) Fairlee in Newport (Isle of Wight) and Fairliehope (Linton Peeblesshire). A Scots family once known as de Ros adopted the name Fairlie when granted lands at Fairlie Ayrshire by Robert the Bruce.2: Irish: variant of Farrelly from Ó Fearghaile.\n\nFarley : 1: English: habitational name from any of various places called Farley of which there are examples in Berkshire Derbyshire Hampshire Kent Somerset Gloucestershire Staffordshire Surrey Wiltshire Shropshire and Sussex. From Old English fearn ‘fern’ + lēah ‘woodland clearing’. See also Farleigh Fairley Fairlie.2: Irish: shortened Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Fearghaile (see Farrelly).\n\nFarrall : Irish: variant of Farrell.\n\nFarrel : Irish: variant of Farrell.\n\nFarrelly : Irish: shortened Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Fearghaile from Fearghaile the longer genitive form of the personal name Fearghal ‘man of valour’ (see Farrell).\n\nFarrely : from Ó Fearghaile see Farrelly.\n\nFarrol : from Ó Fearghail see Farrell.\n\nFarroll : from Ó Fearghail see Farrell.\n\nFerrall : 1: Irish: variant of Farrell from Ó Fearghail.2: English: variant of Fairhall.\n\nFerrel : 1: Irish: variant of Farrell.2: English: variant of Fairhall.\n\nFerrell : 1: Irish: variant of Farrell from Ó Fearghail.2: English: variant of Fairhall.\n\nFerrill : 1: Irish: variant of Farrell.2: English: variant of Fairhall.\n\nFerrol : from Ó Fearghail see Farrell.\n\nFrawley : Irish: shortened Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Freaghaile a metathesized form of Ó Fearghaile (see Farrelly).\n\nFreel : 1: English (of Norman origin): from Middle English freil frele frelle ‘frail weak’ (Old French fresle fraisle fraile).2: Irish: possibly from Ó Frighil a variant of Ó Fearghail; see Farrell.3: Possibly an Americanized form of German Friel 2.\n\nFreely : from Ó Frighile a variant of Ó Fearghaile see Farrelly compare Friel.\n\nFriel : 1: Irish (mainly Donegal and now also in Glasgow): from Gaelic Ó Frighil which is a metathesized form of Ó Fearghail (see Farrell).2: German: from a pet form of the personal name Friedrich.\n\nHarrell : 1: English: variant of Harold.2: Irish: Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó hEarghail ‘descendant of Earghal’ a variant of the personal name Fearghal (see Farrell).\n\nHurrell : 1: English: nickname presumably for someone with shaggy or unkempt hair from a diminutive of Old French hure ‘hair’.2: Irish (Antrim): possibly an Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó hEarghail ‘descendant of Earghal’ a variant of Fearghal (see Farrell Arrell and Harrell).\n\nMackrell : 1: English: nickname from Old French makerel maquerel ‘mackerel’ (the sea fish).2: English: perhaps a nickname from Old French maquerel ‘brothel-keeper broker pimp’ but this is less likely than 1.3: Irish and Scottish: shortened Anglicized form of Gaelic MacFhearghail (compare Farrell).
