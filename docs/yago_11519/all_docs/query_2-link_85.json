        "text": "Hey All,\n\nLeonard Nimoy would have been 89 today! I always like to take a moment to remember him on his birthday. He was a wonderful, brilliant man, fine actor, and great friend to many.\n\nI have to admit, that although he is missed, I am a little thankful that he isn’t here to deal with this pandemic. As a man suffering with COPD from years of smoking,(even though he quit), I suspect he could have caught the virus a bit too easily. But he is at peace now, and, we’re so lucky to have had him in our cultural life.\n\nI also wish a Happy 2nd Anniversary to Adam and Terry (Farrell) Nimoy, who couldn’t have picked a better date of remembrance for their happiness. I wish them love, peace, and safety now and always. ❤ ❤\n\nHi Everyone! Last Saturday (August 24) I had the pleasure of going to the great annual Star Trek convention in upstate NY known as ‘Trekonderoga”! This was my second year at the event, and I had a fun time.\n\nThis year’s guests were David Frankham (Larry Marvick in Is There in Truth No Beauty?), Robin Curtis (Saavik in Star Trek III and IV), Terry Farrell (Jadzia Dax of Deep Space Nine) and Ethan Peck (Spock in Star Trek: Discovery). I was so happy to meet with all these wonderful actors, and especially David Frankham, who is one of the most active 93-year old actors you’ll ever meet, and a total delight!\n\nThis was the second TreKonderoga I’ve been to, (the cons began 5 years ago) and I suspect I’ll go to it again next year (usually in August). The event is based around the year-round attraction that is Star Trek Original Series Tour, where its creator, James Cawley, has totally recreated the complete and original Star Trek set which was used in the fan series Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II. If you’re ever in the area, check out the tour, it truly takes you back in time, it might even make you a little weepy with joy!\n\nI’ll be writing several posts here about each of the actors and events, but for now, enjoy these great cosplayers! These fans brought their game, and it’s lovely!\n\nThis is all kinds of wonderful. Just a few days ago at the the Destination: Star Trek Convention in Birmingham, England, the stars the many Trek incarnations as well as special guests posed on a lovely recreation of the Enterprise bridge! But most importantly, Captain Kirk, Mr. Chekov and Mr. Sulu were back at their stations!\n\nThis picture got me a little emotional! Seeing William Shatner, Walter Koenig and George Takei sitting so fine just made my heart swell (and break just a little)! Unfortunately, Nichelle Nichols couldn’t make it, but I’m sure she was there in spirit. And as beautiful as this is, it made me miss the crew now watching from above: Leonard Nimoy, Deforest Kelley, James Doohan, Majel Barrett, and Grace Lee Whitney ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤\n\nFortunately, the legendary three here had plenty of support in their Trek family. Most notable is Leonard’s son, Adam Nimoy, standing in for his beloved father. As much as I wish that Leonard was still here, I’m so thankful that Adam was there for him.\n\nI also LOVE that George Takei wore a black shirt with a bright yellow sweater, mimicking his original uniform, and look how proudly his sits back at his helm! Steady as she goes!\n\nNow enjoy this moment of Star Trek Awesomeness!"
