        "text": "PITTSFIELD, N.H. – Globe Manufacturing Company kicked off its partnership with the Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund at FDIC 2014, the nation’s largest firefighter training conference and exhibition held April 7-12 in Indianapolis. With its supplier partner, 3M, Globe invited attendees to try its latest turnout gear on the Globe Firefighter Athletic Circuit and committed to make a $10 donation to the Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund in each firefighter’s name. 3M generously matched each donation. In total, Globe and 3M donated $20,000 to the Fund from the Globe Firefighter Athletic Circuit at FDIC.\n\nTerry Farrell was a father, a husband, a brother, and a dedicated firefighter who lost his life on September 11, 2001, during the World Trade Center attack. Among the 343 heroes who died that day, he was in Tower Two when it collapsed. A decorated member of Rescue 4/FDNY and chief of the Dix Hills Volunteer Fire Department, Terry was a devoted firefighter who embodied the spirit of courage and giving. The Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund was established in his memory to assist firefighters and families across the nation with financial, educational and medical support, and to provide equipment donations for fire departments in need.\n\n“We believe in the mission of the Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund and have welcomed them into the Globe family,” said Rob Freese, senior vice president of marketing at Globe Manufacturing Company. “Globe has always given back to the fire service and we are delighted to be able to help firefighters and departments through this worthy cause and hard working group of volunteers.”\n\nThe Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund not only had a booth at FDIC 2014, but also manned the Globe booth with volunteers from chapters across the country in order to raise awareness for the Fund and fundraising activities by Globe and 3M.\n\n“The Terry Fund has been given this great opportunity to partner with Globe. Globe not only makes some of the best and most innovative fire gear on the market today but also strongly supports the fire service through its direct assistance to the Terry Fund,” said Brian Farrell, chairman of the Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund and brother of Terry Farrell. “Firefighters across America will directly benefit from the strong financial support the Fund receives from Globe.”\n\nAlso at FDIC, Globe unveiled new Terry Farrell commemorative turnout gear and will donate a portion of the proceeds from every suit sold to the Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund. 3M will also match Globe’s donation for every suit sold.\n\n“3M is thrilled to partner with Globe in supporting a great foundation like the Terry Farrell Firefighter Fund,” said Jennifer L. Sickmann, global segment marketing manager for 3M. “The engagement from firefighters at the FDIC event was outstanding.”\n\nAbout Globe\n\nGlobe is the largest and most trusted manufacturer of structural firesuits in the world.
