        "text": "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine star Terry Farrell is ready to come out of retirement and ready to bring back Jadzia Dax if the opportunity arises. The fact that the character was killed off doesn’t faze the actress, which delighted the crowd at the 56-Year Mission Star Trek convention in Las Vegas.\n\nBring Back Jadzia\n\nDuring a Deep Space Nine panel, a fan asked Terry Farrell if she was interested in returning to Star Trek and what she thought of resurrecting Jadzia Dax. The actress made it clear she wants to do it and looks to precedent on how, telling the delighted crowd:\n\nI was actually thinking about how Spock died. Didn’t he melt, basically? He saved everyone’s life. And then he just came back… and there he was. And Kirk kind of went, “Oh, there he is.” And everyone nodded and said, “Yes, he’s back!” I want that moment for me… Exactly how you bring her back, it’s no big fucking deal.”\n\nLater a fan mentioned that he always wanted to see Jadzia doing some real hand-to-hand fighting and “kicking butt,” noting he felt her death scene in the season six finale was a “sucker-punch kind of death.” Farrell quickly quipped back:\n\nAnother reason for me to reappear.\n\nFarrell had retired from acting in 2002, to focus on her family. But earlier in the con, she revealed now that her son was off to college, she was ready to return to acting, saying:\n\nI got to do my new eight-by-ten [actor headshot]. I’m very excited. Like, this my life now. I reconnected with my manager. And we’ll see what happens.\n\nStar Trek is more than another job\n\nBut when it comes to Star Trek, Farrell explained it was much more than just another job for her. A fan asked if she would have believed how the early 21st century turned out back when she filmed the episode “Past Tense,” she said “Oh my god no,” adding that she has been “shocked” at the state of the world, feeling the country is “going backward,”, especially in how people treat each other. And here she pivoted to how she sees Star Trek as a force for good:\n\nWe all need so much love and kindness right now. And we can only start with taking care of ourselves and nurturing ourselves as much as possible, and giving and paying it forward as much as we can. And to me, that’s what so great about Deep Space Nine and Star Trek. I just feel so lucky we are part of a show that is never going to go away. All the other jobs I have ever done, nothing compares to the message our show has to give and it keeps doing that… I feel pretty good that we’re all together here and celebrating hope for our future.\n\nHow Avery Brooks helped her early struggles on DS9\n\nDuring a panel discussion on life-changing moments during the production of Deep Space Nine, Farrell got emotional talking about her early days on the series and how she had difficulty with her lines, and it took series star Avery Brooks and director David Livingston to help her get through it:\n\nAt the beginning, even though it was very exciting to get the part, the dialogue was really difficult for me. And they hired me an acting coach when I really needed a dialect coach to work lines with me… There was one episode in particular, and David Livingston was directing and it was a scene with Avery [Brooks] [pauses with emotion] And I couldn’t get it and I was so embarrassed, and Avery was such a champion and he was so kind to me. And they took me to the trailer, the two of them, and he said, “It’s just film! we don’t care.” And I feel bad because Rene [Auberjonois] is not here to say his part of it, but he made me feel really bad about not getting my lines right. It was creating this vortex with me because I was freezing because I was so afraid that I wasn’t going to get it right. So it was just this catch-22 horrible thing. But really, David Livingston and Avery Brooks really helped me feel right again. “It’s okay, everybody goes through it.” They were just so loving and supportive about it, and that was life-changing for me.\n\nMuch from STLV\n\nThere is much more coming for our coverage of the 56-Year Mission Las Vegas (aka STLV).
