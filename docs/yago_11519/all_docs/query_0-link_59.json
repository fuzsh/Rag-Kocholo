Bendickson. Later, her mother married David W. Grussendorf, who adopted Terry and her sister Christine. She was raised in Cedar Rapids. Before becoming a model, she played a Christmas elf at a mall in Cedar Rapids. In 1978, at age 15, she left her hometown in Iowa for a summer in Mexico City as an exchange student. That time in her life made her fond of the big cities, so in her junior year in high school she submitted her image to the Elite Model Agency in New York. Shortly after at the age of 16, she was summoned to NY and within two days of arriving, had an exclusive contract with Mademoiselle Magazine.\n\nAfter 18 months of modeling, she studied acting with Kate McGregor Stewart, while still modeling on the side. Her first major roles were in the short-lived 1983 television series Paper Dolls playing a model and the feature film Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield. In the spring of 1989 she began studying acting with Stella Adler, appearing in a number of guest-starring roles in series like Quantum Leap and The Cosby Show, until in 1993 she was offered a lead role in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\n\nFarrell starred as Lieutenant-Commander Jadzia Dax, Deep Space 9's Starfleet Science Officer, a character who is host to a 300-year old symbiont and can draw upon the memories and knowledge of the symbiont's six previous hosts. Athough she played the character for the series first six years, Farrell decided to leave at the end of her original six-year contract and not renew for the final seventh year with the other cast members.\n\nAfter leaving Deep Space Nine, Farrell won the role of the bartender Reggie in Becker. She appeared in Becker for four years, until the producers decided to replace her with Nancy Travis.\n\nFarrell lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Sprint Corporation spokesman Brian Baker, and her dog Romona. She enjoys cooking and deep sea fishing.\n\nThe asteroid 26734 Terryfarrell, discovered in 2001, was named in her honour by its discoverer, William Kwong Yu Yeung.\n\nTelevision series\n\nPaper Dolls.
