        "text": "1) Return to Acting\n\nA. What prompted you and Brian to return to acting in Love Letters?\n\nBrian and I talked about the possibility of doing a play together - when our son got big enough for us to feel comfortable leaving him with a babysitter. So, when he read about Hershey Area Playhouse's production of Love Letters. Brian contacted the director, Stuart Landon and requested that we take a meeting with him.\n\nAre you looking forward to facing a live audience?\n\nWe had a live audience with Becker - about 200 people every show. However, we weren't nearly as close to the audience as Brian and I will be. It's a thrust stage (seating on three sides), which creates a very intimate setting. At the Playhouse we can nearly sit in the laps of people that are in the front row! That won't be happening of course, but that's how close we are to everyone.\n\nB. According to the January 5 blog by Brian: \"At this point we still need to block the second half of the show. As I mentioned before, Love Letters is a unique play for many reasons.\n\nC. Do you intend to do more stage work, and/or return to TV or films?\n\nI'm not sure where this will take us. I'm always hopeful that I will get to go back to work sometime. I?d love to do another TV movie for Lifetime. I really love that network and the people there are wonderful to work with. But, of course, I would want it to happen over the summer so that I could take my boys with me. ;-) Life is full of all kinds of possibilities.\n\nYou said at one of these conventions: \"It's hard to go from [playing] a hero to a neurotic, bad cook. [Becker].\"\n\nYes, it was very difficult to go from single-camera show to a three-camera show with an audience - a different style altogether. And I have to say it took me out of my comfort zone! But I'm so grateful for that! I learned so much, and I really felt like I stretched every year. I was so looking forward to Season 5 of Becker. It's too bad it didn't happen.\n\nI am, however, forever grateful for the four years I did have. I really learned how to fail in front of others, and I guess that was the hardest lesson of all. It's too bad I didn't learn it in my first job! I will always be grateful for Ted Danson, Dave Hackle and Les Moonves for giving me the opportunity. It was an amazing experience, and it became a favorite way for me to work."
