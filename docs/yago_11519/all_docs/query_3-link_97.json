I found nothing in this framework document which could cause operational issues.\n\nThe CLUE devices are able to detect other CLUE-enabled devices which is of course good for migration/interoperation.\n\nUnrelated to this specific ID (so feel free to ignore) but more on the other documents (data model & protocol): the protocol extensions are briefly mentioned in this framework document section 11, but, can the WG take special care in versioning the CLUE protocol (as proposed in the current protocol I-D) as well as allowing extension of the finite set of values for some information? For exemple, the \"view\" (section 7.1.1.8) has only a limited set of values and there appears to have no way to extend it, is there an intent to open a IANA registry for those values? Probably not as the IANA considerations are 'none'. Does CLUE WG (or another) have the intent to develop a YANG model? It does not appear in the CLUE WG charter.\n\nAs a small nit, I would suggest to move the long section 12 (informative examples) as an appendix.\n\n2015-12-17\n\n24 Benoît Claise [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Benoit Claise\n\n2015-12-17\n\n24 Stephen Farrell\n\n[Ballot comment]\n\nThanks for a pretty comprehensive description.

These sound like\n\nfun systems on which to work.\n\nPity there are so many IPR declarations with not great terms and\n\nfor something that to me at least doesn't appear to require\n\ninvention (just construction of existing bits) but I guess that's\n\nthe world we live in and the WG were ok with that.\n\n- 7.1.1.3 - I wondered if the \"MUST be co-planar\" requirement\n\ncould cause issues (bugs) if receivers don't check for that. Are\n\nreceivers expected to verify that on receipt or is the MUST only\n\nfor senders?\n\n- 7.1.1.10: privacy issues abound, but section 15 only refers to\n\nthe communications security aspect. I think you ought recommend\n\nthat implementations SHOULD minimise the information sent, and\n\nSHOULD give users control over what is sent. You might want to\n\nnote the utility of sending the same subset of information for\n\nregular repeated calls but I'm not sure what clue protocol might\n\nknow that calls are repeats or if there's a better way to manage\n\nre-use of privacy settings for users.\n\n- The secdir review [1] noted some issues that may be worth\n\nconsidering for later WG documents. I'd encourage folks to try\n\nget in touch with the reviewer when doing later work as that\n\nmight avoid some late-surprises. (That is not a threat btw, just\n\nencouragement to try take advantage of a reviewer who likes to\n\nconsider more than just what's in front of him today:-)\n\n[1] https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg06244.html\n\n2015-12-17\n\n24 Stephen Farrell [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Stephen Farrell\n\n2015-12-16\n\n24 Cindy Morgan Changed consensus to Yes from Unknown\n\n2015-12-16\n\n24 Alia Atlas [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Alia Atlas\n\n2015-12-16\n\n24 Barry Leiba [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Barry Leiba\n\n2015-12-16\n\n24 Spencer Dawkins\n\n[Ballot comment]\n\nI remember the first couple of years of CLUE.

This was worth writing.\n\nI'm a Yes, but did have some editorial suggestions and questions.\n\nIn Section 1. Introduction,\n\nCurrent telepresence systems, though based on open standards such\n\nas RTP [RFC3550] and SIP [RFC3261], cannot easily interoperate with\n\neach other.\n\nthis text hasn't changed since the 00 individual draft from 2012. Is it still true for \"current\" telepresence systems?\n\nIn this text:\n\nIf the physical space does not\n\nhave a well-defined front and back, the provider chooses any\n\ndirection for X and Y consistent with right-handed coordinates.\n\nis there any reference/pointer you could provide to a definition of \"consistent with right-handed coordinates\"? If everyone understands that but me, please ignore this comment ...\n\nIs \"line of capture\" a meaningful concept on its own? Or is it only meaningful as \"point on line of capture\"?\n\nI wonder if it would be less confusing if you always called \"volume of capture\" \"3-D volume of capture\". I was consistently assuming \"volume\" was an audio thing, when I saw \"volume of capture\" with no qualifier. You define it as \"3 dimentional volume of capture\", but then drop that qualifier in subsequent use.\n\nIs Person Type just a string for presentation? If so, that's fine, but the framework defines 8 types in some detail, and notes that this list isn't exhaustive and that custom person types can be defined, so I wonder if there's any expectation that CLUE will do anything specific, based on Person Type.\n\nPIP isn't expanded until its 5th use (if I'm reading correctly). I'm guessing that PiPs is the plural of PiP, but that's a guess, and I wouldn't mind a word or two of explanation about that. \"Tiled\" is probably a term of art, so maybe it doesn't need an explanation, but it's not clear whether \"tiled\" and \"PiP\" are the same thing or not (which would be a good thing to include in an explanation, if you add one).\n\n2015-12-16\n\n24 Spencer Dawkins [Ballot Position Update] New position, Yes, has been recorded for Spencer Dawkins\n\n2015-12-16\n\n24 Brian Haberman [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Brian Haberman\n\n2015-12-15\n\n24 Terry Manderson [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Terry Manderson\n\n2015-12-15\n\n24 Ben Campbell\n\n[Ballot comment]\n\nI have some minor comments.

These should be easy to resolve, and I don't think any are show-stoppers.\n\n=== Subtantive ===\n\n- Section 3, MCU definition.\n\nDoes this need a normative reference to 4353? I'm not sure the definition can be understood as written without reading it.\n\n- 4, paragraph (5):\n\nThe 2119 \"OPTIONAL\" is vague about what it applies to. Use of companion protocols? Consider stating this descriptively.\n\n-4, last paragraph:\n\nI don't think the 2119 \"REQUIRED\" is needed or appropriate here. It doesn't seem to add anything, and might be interpreted to not allow local policy decisions, etc.\n\n-5, paragraph 5:\n\nThe paragraph describes what Media Capture means, but never really defines what \"Encoding\" means. (And the definition of \"Encoding\" in the terminology section is somewhat circular.)\n\n- 5, 3rd paragraph after Fig 2:\n\nIsn't setting up media transmission a primary effect?\n\n-6, third bullet:\n\nIt seems kind of odd to use a MUST for this, given that the criteria of professionally installed is somewhat vague. I think a non-normative recommendation would make more sense.\n\n- 7.1.1.7, \"Note\"\n\nWhere are these keywords expected to be defined? This seems like an unfinished section--is it an open to do item?\n\n- 7.1.1.8\n\nWhy is this limited (with a MUST) to these defined values? This list assumes traditional usages. It seems like a more open list would allow for innovative usage. For example, a game court, an outdoor space, etc.\n\n- 7.1.1.9:\n\nThis section seems to need a normative reference to 5646.\n\n- 7.1.1.10: Are LOGO, PHOTO, or SOUND the only kinds of large content that can be carried here?\n\n-7.1.1.11: Is the list of person types exhaustive?\n\n-7.1.1.12: How is priority interpreted? Larger number is higher priority? Is it strictly a matter of ordering, or does 2N represent twice the priority of N?\n\n-8, paragraph after Table 5: \"Simultaneous Transmission Sets MUST allow all\n\nthe media Captures in any particular Capture Scene View...\"\n\nThis seems to reverse the causality. Since the simultaneous transmission set is based on physical limits, shouldn't it say that any particular CSV MUST respect the limitations in the simultaneous transmission sets? (Same for Global View).\n\n- 15, 2nd paragraph:\n\nI think this requires 5239 to be a normative reference.\n\n-15, paragaph 4: \"DTLS/SRTP MUST be supported and SHOULD be used unless the media, which is based on RTP, is secured by other means...\"\n\nIs \"secured by other means\" intended to be the sole exception? If so, then this might should say MUST ... unless\". As defined in 2119, a SHOULD would allow an implementation to skip the protection for other reasons, if the implementer was aware of the implications, etc...\n\nAlso, should the references to 7201 and 7202 be normative?\n\n=== Editorial ===\n\n- Figure 2:\n\nBy SDP Media Session you mean an RTP session as described by the basic SDP right? That is not an SDP session per se.\n\n-5, third paragraph from end:\n\nPlease avoid 2119 keywords inside parenthetical phrases. Also, it's redundant to say implementations of a protocol MUST follow the protocol :-)\n\n2015-12-15\n\n24 Ben Campbell [Ballot Position Update] New position, Yes, has been recorded for Ben Campbell\n\n2015-12-15\n\n24 Martin Stiemerling [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Martin Stiemerling\n\n2015-12-14\n\n24 Joel Jaeggli [Ballot comment]\n\nEric Vynke performed the opsdir review.\n\n2015-12-14\n\n24 Joel Jaeggli [Ballot Position Update] New position, No Objection, has been recorded for Joel Jaeggli\n\n2015-12-04\n\n24 Gunter Van de Velde Request for Telechat review by OPSDIR Completed: Ready.

Recent examples can be found in the \"Action\" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:\n\nTechnical Summary:\n\nThis document defines a framework for a protocol to enable devices in a telepresence conference to interoperate. The protocol enables communication of information about multiple media streams so a sending system and receiving system can make reasonable decisions about transmitting, selecting and rendering the media streams. This protocol is used in addition to SIP signaling and SDP negotiation for setting up a telepresence session.\n\nWorking Group Summary:\n\nWas there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?\n\nThe document was discussed in the meeting, in conferences calls and on the mailing list. The open issues were addressed and there are no open issues, there was consensus on the content of the document.\n\nDocument Quality:\n\nAre there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?\n\nThe actual protocol using the attributes defined in the network is almost done, it is aligned with this document and there is an implementation of the protocol. There are no specific reviews that need to be mentioned.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nWho is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?\n\nRoni Even is the Document Shepherd.\n\nThe responsible AD is Alissa Cooper.\n\n(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.\n\nThe document shepherd reviewed the document in previous and current version and found it ready for publication.\n\n(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?\n\nThe document had good reviews before and during the WGLC.\n\n(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.\n\nNo need\n\n(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.\n\nNo concerns\n\n(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79 have already been filed. If not, explain why?\n\nYes. The authors confirmed.\n\n(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.\n\nThere are IPRs https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&id=draft-ietf-clue-framework from Polycom, Huawei and Ericsson. The WG is aware and there are no concerns.\n\n(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?\n\nThe WG understand the document and agree with it.\n\n(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)\n\nNo\n\n(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/ and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.\n\nNo issues\n\n(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.\n\nNo need for formal review\n\n(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?\n\nYes\n\n(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?\n\nThere are normative references to CLUE WG documents that are almost ready and that had good reviews in the WG.\n\n(15) Are there downward normative references references (see RFC 3967)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.\n\nThere are none\n\n(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.\n\nNo\n\n(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
