        "text": "Like most UK sc-fi fans I've been catching up on the DS9 on the somehow appropriately name Virgin 1 and while DS9 is mostly as good (or better) as I vaguel remember it, what leaps up at me is Terry Farrell's happy-go-lucky (but insincere) mediocre acting. It is all the more glaring, given the otherwise remarkable ensemble cast and the very solid writing. It would even be glaring even on the more lambasted Voyager (Jeri Ryan, Kate Mulgrew, and Roxann Dawson blow her out of the water, even with their more patchy screenplays).\n\nAm I alone in my opinion?\n\nPersonally I found her convincing, but maybe for the same reasons you found her not convincing. Yes she seemed to pause a lot before talking, which could be the actor going \"oh I can't believe I'm fucking saying this trek shit\" and hence ruining her performance or:\n\nHer Character has several lifetimes worth of experience to ponder reactions to actions from. it would be a confusing role to play and if you take her sometimes off-Standish approach into account I would say its Dax going through all her previous lives experience before speaking/acting.\n\nThat makes Dax, to me believable. The times where terry seems mediocre if you look at her closely in the context I mentioned above, you could put it down to a Trill conflicting with itself.\n\nIn which case....\n\nEmmy Award winning performance my dear\n\nI definitely hear where you are coming from. This breezy style of hers is most common in the early seasons, but thankfully fades with time as the show develops. By the later seasons, especially S5 and S6, Jadzia is played much more seriously , especially in the context of the war.\n\nI felt similarly about Dr. Bashir. His early, aloof, snooty persona was offputting (as they creators wanted it to be) but once they let the good doctor show some true grit he became much more interesting to watch.\n\nNope, you aren't alone. A huge portion of DS9 fans hate Terry Farell and Dax on the show, me included.\n\nTerry Farrell is by far the worst actress on the show (she was a model, not an actress) and the worst-written character on the show.\n\nThe other actors on DS9 mostly all have theatre backgrounds (almost always the hallmark of a truly great actor).\n\nHer lines were always generic, interchangeable with Kira, O'Brien or any other character, and completely uninteresting. And woodenly, monotonally-delivered. DS9 would have been a better show without her being on it. She was 100% irrelevant to the plot of the show anyways. The show would have lost nothing by never adding her, but it would have gained not having a useless, annoying character wasting screen-time all the time.\n\nI liked Jadzia, she was one of my favourite characters, and I thought she did well in Becker too. I agree that she would have needed to reflect a bit before answering if she wanted to draw on Dax's memories.\n\nShe was confident, she didn't usually need to act flamboyant, she was skilled, she had Dax, she knew what to do and she did it. When necessary she could explain herself, she could adapt to various situations, work with others, she was good with other cultures and didn't have the prejudices a lot of characters did. I thought she was great.\n\nNope, you aren't alone. A huge portion of DS9 fans hate Terry Farell and Dax on the show, me included.\n\nI didn't know an official poll was done?\n\nI think once the writers knew what to do with Dax (pretty much around Blood Oath) the character and the actor improved. I'd say she was certainly the weakest of the cast members but nothing that ever distracted me from the character. I'm not sure if you gave a different actor the part would it mean much for Dax to be honest.\n\nShe had her moments. I don't blame the actress. The writers really did not know how to work with such a potentially complex character, and just used her as a vehicle for the boring science dialogue, with occasional reminders that she was a hot chick and then further incidental note of the fact Dax had many lifetimes before.\n\nI have said it before: it just doesn't make any sense that they made an effort to establish that Curzon had been this sort of fits-in-with-Klingons-two-fisted-drinker-skirt-chaser guy and he had all these crazy memories with Sisko, and then they tell Terry Farrell to just play this sort of \"I'm-a-quiet-girl-science-nerd-and-I've-got-a-secret\" kind of removed performance.\n\nThey realized it wasn't working later and told her to act like Errol Flynn, but of course no acting job could keep that from ringing a bit false after several seasons of other stuff.\n\nIt was interesting when that dork stole the symbiont for a few hours in season 2 and then immediately started acting sort of heightened, yet it was clear the symbiont did not \"take control.\" It made me wonder if it was Jadzia's ego driving her to act \"superior\" or \"enlightened\" instead of cutting loose. Of course, later Ezri got the symbiont and acted goofy instead, because they didn't want to handcuff themselves any more. More than one writer was heard to remark they wish they'd started with an insecure \"accidentally joined' sort of Trill at the beginning.\n\nSince DS9 Trills bore zero goddamn resemblance to TNG Trills, it seems clear that not quite enough thought was put into some of the elements that were to inform the performances. I can't blame Terry Farrell.\n\nCalm down everyone. If I drive a Chevy or Renault (snicker), amongst Lexus, Infiniti, and BMW-the Chevy's not gonna look too smoky. The Chevy maybe alright w/other Chevy's and Fords, but not in the rarefied company of the other cars. See me point?\n\nI saw Terri as an OK actor, but amongst Visitor, Rene, and all others (even Dorn) she just couldn't cut it.\n\nI saw her on Cosby a couple of times, it was just like DS9, vanilla lines....yada yada....\n\nOne of the problems w/the TF was what to do w/her. Make her hot or brainy, she comes off unconvincing as both (gah, hope that didn't come off as sexist).\n\nI'm going to have to disagree. Jadzia Dax was one of my most favorite characters (Ezri my most hated...in fact...the only one I hated in all of Deep Space Nine. Huh). I loved what Farrell did with her: she was sexy, beautiful, smart, tough, intelligent, both a mentor and child. I don't think anyone but her could have pulled it off. Actually, Dax is one of the great characters in all of Trek, in my most humble opinion.\n\nDid I mention sexy?"
