Having already hired K2 for the last office on Bruton Street, Tom Gore – who also owns the Detroit Pistons NBA team – once again turned to K2 to design and build their new Mayfair office at 5 Hanover Square which was needed to house their expanding team.

The brief was to house their 40 London staff in a World-class facility with the feel of a luxury boutique hotel and to reflect the core values of the company and their clients. The office needed to include client-facing meeting rooms and a client club lounge with a concierge service and to offer clients a “home from home” when visiting. Finishes would reflect neutral, timeless tones. The design was a collaboration with their LA-based design team.

Platinum value having their staff in the office encouraging collaboration and impromptu meetings both internal and with clients and wanted a facility that encouraged their team to be in the office – return to the office is near 100%.
