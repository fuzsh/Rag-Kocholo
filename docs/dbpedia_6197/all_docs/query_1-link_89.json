        "text": "Earlier today, we announced Oregon Tool, the parent company for Woods Equipment, will have a change in financial investment ownership. For the last 5 years, Oregon Tool has been privately held by American Securities and P2 Capital Partners (AS/P2). Today, AS/P2 announced an agreement was completed with Platinum Equity to acquire ownership of Oregon Tool.\n\nPlatinum Equity is excited by our global footprint, committed Team Members, strategic priorities, our impressive growth and future plans.\n\nThe investment support, scale and experience our new owners bring to Oregon Tool and Woods Equipment Company will enable us to realize our goal of serving the needs of landowners everywhere. Platinum Equity believes in, and fully supports our leadership team, and the strategic plans and vision we have developed. They will provide the investment and resources we need to achieve our aggressive goals, accelerate our momentum and further our position as industry leaders and innovators.\n\nIn reality, this change should go unnoticed except for accelerated growth and investment.\n\nThank you for your business and the continued support and passion for our brand. We look forward to continuing to “Get After It”!\n\n#GetAfterIt #WoodsEquipment"
