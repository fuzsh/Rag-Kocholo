This doesn’t influence our ratings, and the opinions are our own. Learn more here.\n\nWarren Buffett, Michael Jordan, and the average millionaire all have one thing in common: They invest in appreciating assets.\n\nIn fact, real estate investing (which is one of the best assets that appreciate in value) has created 90% of the world’s millionaires.\n\nSo if you want to learn how to buy appreciating assets and build wealth like the top 1%, then this will be your go-to guide.\n\nLet’s dive right in.\n\nWhat are Appreciating Assets?\n\nAppreciating assets increase in value over time. Assets that appreciate are typically worth less today than you expect them to be in the future. The value of these assets should outpace the rate of inflation.\n\nGet Exclusive Money Tips Straight to Your Inbox\n\nEvery Saturday morning, you’ll get 1 actionable tip to help you get out of debt, increase your income, and multiply your wealth 👇\n\n17 Best Appreciating Assets to Invest In\n\nAs long as you are consistent and committed to accumulating assets that have the potential to appreciate, you can build your wealth substantially.\n\nWith that said, here are the 17 best appreciating assets to invest in:\n\nPrivate Real Estate\n\nRare Art\n\nFine Wine\n\nFarmland\n\nRental Real Estate\n\nSmall Businesses\n\nHigh Yield Savings Account\n\nBitcoin\n\nIndex Funds\n\nYourself\n\nYour Blog\n\nYour Twitter Account\n\nYour Business\n\nStocks\n\nPrecious Metals\n\nIconic Sport Collectibles\n\nAlternative Assets\n\nI’ll also include a step-by-step investing guide for every asset so you can easily invest in each one. Let’s get started.\n\n1. Private Real Estate\n\nPrivate real estate investing used to be a “country club” pastime, being expensive and exclusive to the ultra-wealthy.\n\nNow, thanks to modern technology, virtually anyone can start investing in private real estate through platforms like Fundrise for as little as $10.\n\nWith private real estate, you can:\n\nBuild wealth\n\nCombat inflation\n\nDiversify your portfolio\n\nProtect against market volatility\n\nEarn passive income from rent\n\nPrivate real estate can actually return more for less risk.\n\nAnd, historically speaking, private real estate (in orange) is also much less volatile than the stock market.\n\nIf you don’t like seeing your portfolio fluctuate from the recent market volatility, private real estate could be a good solution.\n\nAnd that’s where Fundrise comes into play 👇\n\nWith over $1.5 billion of assets under management and over $5.1 billion of asset transactions, Fundrise is definitely a popular and successful investment platform option.\n\nWith Fundrise, you can invest in 3 property types:\n\nApartments\n\nCommercial real estate\n\nSingle-family properties\n\nThe best part?\n\nBy investing in real estate, you also have the opportunity to earn passive quarterly income.\n\nHow to Invest in Private Real Estate\n\nInvesting in private real estate is simple – and it should only take you a few minutes.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\nSign up to Fundrise\n\nChoose your portfolio strategy\n\nFund your account\n\nPlace your investment\n\nCollect your dividends\n\nStay invested for the long-term\n\nKeep in mind that Fundrise is an illiquid investment, so your money can be locked up for up to 5+ years.\n\nAlways make sure you do your thorough research before investing.\n\nRecommended Reading: Fundrise Review\n\n2. Rare Art\n\nRare art is one of the best assets to build wealth in the long run.\n\nJust take a look at how the art market has performed against the stock market over the last 26 years.\n\nFrom the 1995 to 2021 time period, contemporary art yielded an average annual return of 13.8% while the S&P 500 (representing the U.S. stock market) returned 10.2%.\n\nAnd it gets better: Art is also seen as a hedge against inflation and stock market volatility.\n\nCheck out the chart below, which illustrates the correlation of contemporary art versus the ups and downs of the stock market:\n\nThis chart shows that when the stock market goes down (represented by the S&P 500), the contemporary art market does not go down.\n\nWhy is this a good thing?\n\nIf you’re in the middle of a recession, art investments you own will likely not go down.\n\nHow to Invest in Art\n\nSo how do you get started with art investing?\n\nThere are several options available, including:\n\nArt investment platforms – Investors who want to buy shares of multi-million dollar paintings\n\nArt indices – Investors who want to invest using EFTs or mutual funds\n\nNFT exchanges – High-risk, tech-savvy investors who are familiar with the digital, non-fungible token world\n\nArt auction houses – Well-informed investors who have the money to pay the high upfront cost of buying physical art\n\nThe easiest way to invest in art is by joining an art investment platform, like Masterworks 👇\n\nMasterworks gives investors the opportunity to buy shares of paintings worth over $30 million in $20 increments.\n\nHere’s the process to start investing:\n\nSign up to Masterworks\n\nComplete the phone interview\n\nMeet your dedicated sales rep\n\nStart making your art investments\n\nIf you want to invest in an appreciating asset that is not tied to the stock market, then investing in rare art could be a good idea.\n\nRecommended Reading: Masterworks Review\n\n3. Fine Wine\n\nDid you know that one of the fastest appreciating and most stable assets is fine wine?\n\nTake a look at the image below:\n\nOver the past 20 years, fine wine has outperformed the S&P 500 – even during recessions.\n\nAnd it gets better: Fine wine is less volatile than real estate or gold.\n\nHere’s an example of one fine wine investment:\n\nWhen you invest in fine wine through a platform like Vinovest, you actually own the bottle itself.\n\nYou could resell the bottle for a profit or send the bottle to your home and enjoy the liquid gold!\n\nAnother benefit to fine wine investing is that you can:\n\nManage portfolio risk\n\nCounter any market volatility\n\nDiversify your investment portfolio\n\nBut how do you get started with fine investing?\n\nHere’s how:\n\nHow to Invest in Fine Wine\n\nInvesting in fine wine is easy and fast.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\n1. Sign up to Vinovest\n\nThe easiest way to invest in fine wine is by signing up to the Vinovest platform 👇\n\nIt takes only a few minutes to sign up and virtually anyone can be a fine wine investor.\n\n2.

Execute Your Wine Investment\n\nAfter you’ve done your research, funded your account, and decided which fine wine bottle to buy, then it’s time to execute your investment.\n\nRemember that to make a profit on your wine investment, you’ll likely have to hold your bottles of wine for several years (if not decades).\n\nRecommended Reading: Vinovest Review\n\n4. Farmland\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 into farmland back in 1991, your investment would have grown by 2,058% and would be worth over $215,000+.\n\nThis is no joke.\n\nInvesting in farmland can be very lucrative – and farmland has been one of the most stable – and high performing – investments over the past 30 years.\n\nIn the screenshot above, you’ll see a green line that indicates farmland price appreciation, which has consistently increased over time.\n\nFarmland investing is also much less volatile than investing in stocks or REITs for example.\n\nAs you can see, even though the volatility is lower than gold, the S&P 500, or REITs, the overall farmland return is still roughly the same – if not better.\n\nHow to Invest in Farmland\n\nInvesting in farmland isn’t as complex as you might think it is.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\n1. Join FarmTogether\n\nThe easiest way to invest in farmland is to sign up to FarmTogether.\n\nFarmTogether is free to join and it takes about 5 to 10 minutes to set up your profile.\n\n2.

Rental Real Estate\n\nDid you know that 90% of the world’s millionaires invest in real estate?\n\nEspecially with the recent surge in housing prices, it can make sense to invest in appreciating assets like real estate.\n\nWhile it’s not certain that property prices will continue to surge as they have post-COVID, investing in rental real estate can help you earn money in 2 ways.\n\nCheck out the image below:\n\nAs the image shows, by investing in real estate, you can earn money in 2 ways:\n\nPassive income from rent\n\nNet gains from property appreciation\n\nIn fact, the annual returns for rental real estate versus traditional investments (like the S&P 500) over the past 2 decades have outperformed by 2.3% (which can add up to $1,000’s over the years).\n\nDid you know that you can start investing in rental real estate – even if you’re not a millionaire [yet]?\n\nHere’s how:\n\nHow to Invest in Rental Real Estate\n\nInvesting in rental real estate isn’t as complex as you might think – and that’s all thanks to fractional investing and modern technology.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\n1.

Small Businesses\n\nThe movers and shakers of this society include the people that had the courage to invest in small businesses.\n\nIn fact, by investing in small businesses, you could access 10% to 25% in target returns.\n\nWhile investing in private equity markets like small businesses can be volatile and risky, the rewards can certainly outweigh the cons.\n\nFor example, take a look at the chart below:\n\nAs you can see, private equity investments have outperformed traditional investments like the S&P 500 over the past 2 decades.\n\nIn fact, studies like the one below indicate that private equity markets are also often less volatile than the S&P 500:\n\nSource: Crowdfund Insider\n\nWhile there are many pros to investing in small businesses, there are also some cons such as keeping your money locked up for several years (up to 7+).\n\nThe good news is that investing in small businesses could help you:\n\nEarn a net profit\n\nEarn passive income\n\nImprove your local community\n\nHow to Invest in Small Businesses\n\nModern technology makes it easy to start investing in small businesses for as little as $100.\n\nThe best part?\n\nYou pay $0 in fees.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\n1.

Decide How Much to Invest\n\nThe minimum investment is $100 and typically Mainvest’s maximum investment is $2,200 if your annual income or net worth is less than $107,000.\n\nRecommended Reading: Mainvest Review\n\n7. High Yield Savings Account\n\nNo matter what stage in life you’re currently in, you should always stash extra cash in an emergency savings fund.\n\nIn fact, about 57% of Americans can’t afford a $500 emergency with cash… so what do they do?\n\nThey rack up credit card debt (ouch!).\n\nWith that said, I’m going to show you exactly how to open an emergency savings account so you can protect your financial self.\n\nHow to Open a High Yield Savings Account\n\nOpening a high yield savings account can be fast, free, and easy.\n\nHere’s how to do it in 3 simple steps:\n\nGo to Raisin\n\nSelect your high yield savings account\n\nBegin making regular deposits and let your cash build up\n\nRaisin offers FDIC insurance, no fees, and a $1 minimum deposit.\n\nThe best part?\n\nRaisin is available in 30+ countries.\n\nSpend 15 minutes today to set yourself up for financial security and you’ll thank yourself later.\n\n8. Bitcoin\n\nWhile 2022 has not been kind to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, one could argue that now is the best time to buy – if you’re buying the dip.\n\nIn fact, in early 2021, Bitcoin was dubbed the best-performing asset of the decade.\n\nHere is an example of the magnitude of returns from Bitcoin:\n\nYear Return\n\n2017\n\n1,318%\n\n2018\n\n-72.60%\n\n2019\n\n87.20%\n\n2020\n\n302.80%\n\n2021\n\n59.8%\n\nWhile Bitcoin is still in its infantile stages, the crypto market as a whole has absolutely surpassed most expectations with past rallies.\n\nTake a look at the chart below:\n\nThis graph demonstrates that Bitcoin has not only become a very popular digital currency in the modern world but that it is also one of the highest appreciating assets.\n\nBeware: Bitcoin is extremely volatile and there is no guarantee that it will continue to appreciate. Only invest as much as you are comfortable losing.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin\n\nBuying Bitcoin is a simple process.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\n1. Join an Exchange\n\nThe easiest way to buy Bitcoin is to join a crypto exchange.\n\nI use Kraken platoform 👇\n\nIt’s free to join Kraken and the sign-up process takes less than 5 minutes.\n\n2.

Store Your Bitcoin\n\nAfter you’ve executed your Bitcoin order, the next step is to determine where to store your Bitcoin.\n\nIf you signed up with Kraken, you can simply store your Bitcoin on Kraken’s secure hot wallet.\n\nIf you’re skeptical about hackers and want to store your Bitcoin offline, then check out the Ledger Nano X 👇\n\nThe Ledger Nano X provides maximum security and keeps your Bitcoin away from hackers by storing it offline.\n\n5. Oversee Your Bitcoin Investment\n\nThe last step in this process is to oversee your Bitcoin investment.\n\nMany crypto investors follow the “HODL” investing practice.\n\nHODL Defined: HODL is an acronym, which means “hold on for dear life.”\n\nIn other words, invest for the long term and resist the urge to sell during short-term crypto volatility.\n\n9. Index Funds\n\nDo you want to…\n\nIncrease your net worth\n\nInvest in low-cost assets\n\nInvest in easy-to-understand assets\n\nIf yes, then index funds might be the right option for you.\n\nIndex Funds Definition: An index fund is 1 fund that’s made up of hundreds, if not thousands of individual stocks or bonds.\n\nThere are many types of index funds, including:\n\nS&P 500\n\nRussel 2000\n\nRussell 3000\n\nNasdaq Composite\n\nVanguard 500 Index\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average\n\nWhile index funds certainly experience volatility, historically speaking, they have increased in value over the long term.\n\nTake a look at the chart of the S&P 500 index fund, below:\n\nSo far, the fund has steadily grown – even after crippling recessions.\n\nIndex funds are often popular because they are:\n\nLow cost\n\nPassively managed\n\nDiversified across many companies\n\nOk great, but how do you get started with index investing?\n\nHere’s how:\n\nHow to Invest in Index Funds\n\nBefore you start investing in an index fund, you’ll want to open an investment account.\n\nMy personal favorite is M1 Finance, which is a great app, especially for long-term investors.\n\nOnce you’ve opened your account, follow these steps:\n\nDo your research\n\nPick an index fund\n\nBuy index fund shares\n\nKeep investing for the long term\n\nRemember that this is a long-term investment and while you might see declines, they are only temporary.\n\nStay focused on the future, and your bank accounts will thank me later!\n\n10. Yourself\n\nInvesting in yourself is a form of investing in an appreciating asset.\n\nWhen you invest in yourself and in your own capabilities, you can achieve almost anything.\n\nThe good news is that you don’t have to go back to college and take on $10,000’s in student debt.\n\nThanks to modern teaching platforms like Udemy, you can learn almost anything for a fraction of the cost of college 👇\n\nIn fact, one of my favorite courses that is offered on Udemy – especially if you’re looking to start your own business – is called: An Entire MBA in 1 Course.\n\nThe professor who teaches this course completed his MBA at Columbia University and has worked at Goldman Sachs, venture capital firms, and hedge funds in the past.\n\nWhile not every course costs money on Udemy – there are some that are free – compared to what you would have to spend in college for an MBA, this Udemy course costs peanuts!\n\nHow to Invest in Yourself\n\nThere are many ways to invest in yourself.\n\nHere are a few great examples:\n\nExercise\n\nMeditate\n\nSet goals\n\nAvoid debt\n\nLearn daily\n\nShow gratitude\n\nEmbrace failure\n\nPay yourself first\n\nConnect with a mentor\n\nThe point is this: Start investing in yourself today.\n\nEven if you carve out just 30 minutes a day to learn an additional skill, you’ll already be ahead of the game.\n\n11. Your Blog\n\nHave you ever dreamed of making $10,000+ per month from the comfort of your home?\n\nBelieve it or not, you can.\n\nAnd it’s all thanks to blogging.\n\nEspecially since the dawn of COVID-19, if there is anything we learned, it’s that there is no such thing as the stability of a full-time job.\n\nBuilding multiple income streams is literally a form of self-care.\n\nAnd blogging could even replace your full-time job at some point.\n\nHow to Make Money Blogging\n\nWant to learn how you can make money blogging?\n\nHere’s how:\n\n1. Choose Your Niche\n\nBefore you start writing about anything, make sure you take some time to think about your area of specialty.\n\nOf course, you should always consider your passions, but you should also think about topics that are popular and that can make you a lot of money.\n\nBelow are some popular and profitable niche examples:\n\nHealth\n\nFinance\n\nFashion\n\nLifestyle\n\nBusiness\n\nMarketing\n\nEven before you type your first word, you should start thinking about how you can monetize your blog.\n\n2. Create Content\n\nDon’t just sit and start writing.\n\nTo craft the finest content, you need to strategically plan and research the information.\n\nPro Tip: There are 2 main keys to becoming a successful blogger: 1) Post consistently; 2) Be patient.\n\nEspecially as you just start writing, you should try to post consistently.\n\nThe key is not to sacrifice quality over quantity.\n\nSince it’s important to upload multiple posts, you should start planning topic ideas far in advance.\n\n3. Build a Reputation\n\nYour best marketing tool is your reputation.\n\nHow do you improve your blogging reputation?\n\nHere’s how:\n\nBe a guest blogger\n\nWork with experts\n\nPersonally speaking, guest blogging is likely one of the most effective ways to boost your reputation.\n\nNote: Especially if you are newer to the blogging world, you should expect to be turned down multiple times before receiving a “yes” to guest blog.\n\nWhile you can always reach out to major publications (such as Inc.com, Forbes, Business Insider, etc.) the chances of you landing a published article are pretty low.\n\nThat’s why you should probably start by reaching out to fellow bloggers and/or experts in your niche and build your reputation from there.\n\n4. Promote Your Content\n\nYou are your own best advocate.\n\nThe only way to start growing your platform is by promoting your content.\n\nSome key ways to promote your content are through:\n\nSEO\n\nSocial media\n\nYour email list\n\nI’ve built a 145k+ following on Twitter and average between 10 million to 13 million views per month – all for free.\n\nAnother way to promote yourself is by building an email list.\n\nPro Tip: Your email list is the most valuable component of your marketing efforts. It is also often the easiest way to sell your products and services.\n\nBuild your email list by:\n\nWriting weekly newsletters\n\nCreating an email landing page\n\nPromoting the list on your social media account\n\nI cannot stress enough how important an email list is to your success.\n\n5. Advertise Within Your Blog\n\nYou can make serious money through your email list and social media profile.\n\nBut those 2 steps require lots of work.\n\nThere’s another way to earn money passively, by placing ads on your blog.\n\nHere are a few example ad networks:\n\nAdThrive\n\nMediavine\n\nGoogle AdSense\n\nThe more these ads are viewed and/or clicked, the more money you earn.\n\n6. Sell Your Products/ Services\n\nYou can make $1,000’s by selling your own products and/or services on your blog.\n\nSome very common examples include:\n\nEbooks\n\nCourses\n\nConsulting\n\nAs an example, I sell my own ebook, How to Get Rich from Nothing, on my blog.\n\nIt cost me virtually nothing to write and publish, and within the first week of publishing the ebook, I earned over $2,000!\n\n7. Become an Affiliate\n\nBecoming an affiliate is a great way to build wealth.\n\nThe good news is that you can make $1,000’s per month (some people even make over $100,000+ per month!).\n\nThe bad news?\n\nIt takes time.\n\nHere’s how to monetize your blog with affiliate marketing:\n\nGet an Affiliate Marketing Course\n\nJoin affiliate marketing networks\n\nSelect the companies that best work with your niche\n\nPromote the companies within your content\n\nKeep in mind that it typically takes a lot of time (we’re talking several years) to build a solid affiliate income stream.\n\n8. Sell Your Blog\n\nThe final strategy is to consider your exit.\n\nAKA: How, when, and for how much to sell your blog.\n\nHow much your blog sells for depends on the income your blog generates each month.\n\nThat’s why it’s important to focus on website traffic and income first.\n\nAfter you’ve mastered those two categories, you can then consider selling your website for 24 to 36 times its monthly income.\n\nYou can sell your website:\n\nTo an individual\n\nTo a company\n\nOn a marketplace\n\nThere are several success stories of blogs receiving offers of $10 million+ to sell their website.\n\nTake some time to think about whether this is the right next step for you.\n\n12. Your Twitter Account\n\nOne of the best appreciating assets could easily be your Twitter account.\n\nDon’t believe me?\n\nCheck out how much my good friend Dino has made by selling his Twitter services in the past 2 years:\n\nAs you can see, you can become a millionaire without:\n\nA genius IQ score of 160\n\nA fancy Ivy League degree\n\n20 years of marketing experience\n\nAll you need is a phone, WiFi, and a Twitter account.\n\nHere’s how you can get started:\n\nHow to Turn Your Twitter Account into a Money Printing Machine\n\nIf you want to make money on Twitter, then follow my step-by-step guide below:\n\n1. Find Your Specialty\n\nBefore you even open a Twitter account, the very first step is to pick your area of specialty.\n\nAre you worried that you don’t have a niche?\n\nNo problem.\n\nTry thinking about an area of specialty in the 3 most lucrative markets:\n\nHealth\n\nWealth\n\nRelationships\n\nIt’s hard to go wrong when finding a niche in these categories.\n\nAfter you set up your Twitter profile, it’s time to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat are my audience’s pain points?\n\nHow can I add value to my audience?\n\nWhat can I do to solve my audience’s problems?\n\nThe answers might not come to you right away, so keep these questions in the back of your mind.\n\n2. Grow Your Audience\n\nThe next step is to grow your audience by creating the best content possible.\n\nPro Tip: To build a money printing Twitter machine, make sure that your content adds value and solves your audience’s pain points.\n\nNot sure how or where to start writing tweets?\n\nHere’s my secret to Twitter success: X Mastery 👇\n\nThe key is consistently sticking to the methods in the X Mastery course.\n\n3. Monetize Your Twitter Account\n\nOnce you’ve established a solid Twitter audience, it’s time to monetize your account (while still adding value).\n\nThere are many ways to make money on Twitter:\n\nBecome a Ghostwriter\n\nAffiliate Marketing\n\nBuild Your Email List\n\nPromote Your Business\n\nPost Sponsored Content\n\nUse Subscriptions\n\nUse Ticketed Spaces\n\nStart a Community\n\nSell Your Products/Services\n\nGet Clients\n\nAds Revenue Sharing\n\nWhichever option you choose, just remember not to be spammy with your promotion strategy.\n\nPro Tip: There needs to be a balance between proving value and promoting.\n\nThe trick is to continually provide value to your audience while also integrating your products or services.\n\nIf you want the complete guide to growing and monetizing your Twitter audience, check out the X Mastery course.\n\n13. Your Business\n\nDo you want to increase the odds of becoming a millionaire?\n\nThen you may want to consider starting your own business.\n\nIn fact, 66% of millionaires own their own business.\n\nAnd it can be your own business that is an appreciating asset – adding to your net worth with time.\n\nSurprisingly, however, fewer than 20% of households (18% to be exact) are run by a business owner.\n\nYet, self-employed people are 4x more likely to become millionaires than those who are employed.\n\nWhile starting a business is certainly no walk in the park, I would argue that it’s worth the risk – especially if you’re young.\n\nAnd not surprisingly, studies have shown that people tend to love their work if they have some sort of autonomy.\n\nBeing your own business owner, you can:\n\nWork from anywhere\n\nSet your own schedule\n\nWork with the people you like\n\nWork on something that is meaningful to you\n\nStarting a business – whether online or in-store – is likely to build your future legacy.\n\nHow to Start a Business\n\nStarting a business takes a lot of planning and research.\n\nWithout key data points, your business idea could fail as fast as you started.\n\nHere are 10 steps you can take to start building – and growing – your own business from start to finish:\n\nCreate a business idea\n\nResearch your business idea\n\nWrite a business plan\n\nChoose a business structure\n\nGet a federal tax ID\n\nOpen a business bank account\n\nGet financing to fund your business\n\nBuild your team\n\nBrand yourself and advertise\n\nGrow your business\n\nRemember, you don’t need $1,000’s to start building your business.\n\nAll you need is grit, dedication, and resourcefulness.\n\n14. Stocks\n\nThe majority of millionaires have a portion of their money invested in stocks.\n\nWhy?\n\nStocks have historically shown a lot of potential for appreciation in value.\n\nFor example, check out the image of Amazon’s historical performance below.\n\nAs you can see, stocks typically make a good investment if you hold on to them for the long run.\n\nThat’s why it’s critical to maintain a long-term mindset when investing.\n\nBut stocks can be very volatile in the short term, as evidenced by the image of the Amazon stock below.\n\nThis 6-month snapshot of Amazon stock looks a lot more volatile compared with the 24-year snapshot.\n\nCaution: Don’t put 100% of your money into a single stock with the hope that you’ll make gigantic returns.\n\nA well-balanced portfolio is key.\n\nHow to Buy Stocks\n\nBuying stocks isn’t as difficult as you may think.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\n1. Download an Investment App\n\nThe easiest way to buy stocks is to download an investment app that lets you trade stocks.\n\nMy personal favorite investment app is M1 Finance 👇\n\nM1 is free to download and it took me about 5 minutes to set it up.\n\n2.
