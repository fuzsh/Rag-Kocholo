        "text": "We get many questions about what “financial modeling” means, how important it is in the finance industry, and why so many students and professionals are obsessed with learning it.\n\nSo, let’s start with the basic definition:\n\nFinancial Modeling Definition: A financial model is a spreadsheet-based abstraction of a real company that helps you estimate the company’s future cash flows, financing requirements, valuation, and whether or not you should invest in the company; models are also used to assess the viability of acquisitions and the development of new assets.\n\nSuppose that your crazy rich uncle calls you and tells you about his latest investment: a tequila company into which he just “poured” $100,000.\n\nHe shares data about the company’s sales, employee count, and market share, and then he claims that his $100,000 investment will be worth $1 million in 5 years.\n\nHe then gently encourages you to put your life savings into this tequila company.\n\nA robust financial model lets you input these parameters, project the company’s future cash flows, and assess the likelihood of your uncle’s $100,000 investment turning into $1 million in 5 years.\n\nFinancial models cannot predict any outcome with a high degree of certainty.\n\nThe goal is to be “roughly correct” rather than “precisely wrong.”\n\nIf a financial model tells you that a company is undervalued by 5% or 10%, that is a meaningless result because the margin of error is so high.\n\nBut if the model tells you that the company is undervalued by 90% or overvalued by 200%, those are much more useful results.\n\nEven if you’re wrong about the percentages, you can still make money if you are directionally correct.\n\nReturning to this tequila company example, perhaps your model produces the following results for your uncle’s $100,000 investment:\n\n$1 million in 5 Years: This would require the tequila company to grow from 1% to 10% market share in a very crowded market within 5 years. Alternatively, the company could also get there by selling its tequila at 3x the normal price and capturing 3% of the market.\n\n$500,000 in 5 Years: This would require the company to win 5% market share within 5 years or sell its tequila at 2x the normal price while capturing 2% of the market.\n\n$200,000 in 5 Years: This would require 3% market share within 5 years or tequila sold for 2x the normal price and 1% of the market (the same as the current share).\n\nWhat’s the conclusion?\n\nIt’s unlikely that your uncle’s $100,000 investment will turn into $1 million within 5 years because the required pricing and market share are unrealistic.\n\nWe can’t assign a specific probability to this outcome, but we can say that no food & beverage company in history has ever achieved this performance in this time frame.\n\nTherefore:\n\nIf the company does achieve this performance, it will likely take more than 5 years.\n\nAnd the other outcomes here, especially the last one, are more plausible.\n\nDoubling or quintupling your money over 5 years is still a great result, so you might take your uncle’s advice and invest some amount.\n\nOr, perhaps you do further research into the company and its market, become more skeptical, and decide against investing.\n\nA financial model is just a PART OF the investment process; it’s like a piece of evidence in a courtroom murder trial.\n\nIt can help persuade others that you are correct, but a spreadsheet by itself doesn’t solve the case or convince everyone on the jury.\n\nIn these financial models, you project a company’s revenue, expenses, and cash flow-related line items, such as the Change in Working Capital and Capital Expenditures.\n\nYou then use these numbers to forecast the company’s financial statements, i.e., its Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement, over several years.\n\nThe Income Statement shows a company’s revenue, expenses, and taxes over a period of time and ends with its Net Income (i.e., its after-tax profits).\n\nThe Balance Sheet shows a company’s Assets, or its resources that will deliver future benefits, and its Liabilities & Equity, or its funding sources that have direct or indirect “costs.”\n\nThe Cash Flow Statement provides a reconciliation between a company’s Net Income and the cash it generates, which is often quite different.\n\nFor example, accounting rules state that cash outflows for spending on long-term items such as factories and properties should not appear directly on the Income Statement because these items could be useful for many years.\n\nSo, companies record the cash outflows for this spending as “Capital Expenditures” on the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nIf a company buys a new factory for $100 million, its cash flow is reduced by $100 million – but you wouldn’t know it by looking at the Income Statement.\n\nThe company’s Income Statement only shows the “Depreciation” representing the allocation of this $100 million over many years.\n\nFor example, if the factory is expected to be useful for 20 years, the company might record $100 million / 20 = $5 million of Depreciation per year on its Income Statement.\n\nThe Cash Flow Statement records all the cash inflows and outflows, which gives you a full picture of the company’s business health.\n\nIt prevents companies from hiding behind non-cash revenue and expenses that might distort their Income Statement.\n\nThese 3-statement models are widely used at normal companies for budgeting purposes and at banks and investment firms to assess companies’ financing requirements.\n\nFor example, a 3-statement model might tell you that a company will need additional capital in 3-4 years to continue its aggressive expansion strategy:\n\nIf a company has already borrowed money, a 3-statement model might tell you how well it can repay that Debt over the next 5 years.\n\n3-Statement Model Examples\n\nHere are a few examples of 3-statement models:\n\nIllinois Tool Works – Sample 3-Statement Modeling Test and Tutorial\n\nIndustrials Investment Banking – Screenshots from an airline 3-statement model\n\nHealthcare Investment Banking – Screenshots from a bio/pharma 3-statement model\n\nIn valuation models, you estimate the range of values an entire company might be worth today.\n\nFor example, if a public company’s market capitalization (market cap) is $10 billion, is it overvalued, undervalued, or appropriately valued?\n\nShould it be worth closer to $5 billion, or something closer to $15 billion?\n\nValuations are designed to answer these questions.\n\nYou can value a company using different methodologies, but two of the most important ones are the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis and trading multiples, also called “comparable companies,” “public comps,” or “comparable company analysis.”\n\nIn a DCF, you project a company’s cash flows far into the future (5, 10, or even 20+ years) and discount them to their “Present Value” – what they’re worth today, assuming that you could invest your money elsewhere at a certain rate of return.\n\nWith trading multiples, you calculate other companies’ values relative to their financial metrics, such as revenue or profits, and you apply those “multiples” to value your company.\n\nFor example, if similar companies are worth 3x their annual revenue, and your company has revenue of $200 million, perhaps it should be worth about $600 million.\n\nIn a DCF model, similar to the 3-statement models above, you start by projecting the company’s revenue, expenses, and cash flow line items.\n\nUnlike 3-statement models, however, you do not need the full Income Statement, Balance Sheet, or Cash Flow Statement.\n\nMany of the items on these statements are non-recurring or have nothing to do with the company’s core business, so a partial Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement are sufficient:\n\nThis approach saves time and results in nearly the same output in most cases.\n\nValuation and DCF Model Examples\n\nYou can get examples of valuation and DCF models below:\n\nComparable Company Analysis\n\nUber Valuation\n\nSnap Valuation\n\nDCF Model – Walmart Valuation\n\nThe Walmart example also explains the “big idea” behind valuation and DCF analysis.\n\nA merger model is different because it involves two companies rather than one.\n\nThe goal is to assess whether a larger company’s acquisition of a smaller company provides a financial benefit.\n\nFor example, will the acquirer’s Earnings per Share (EPS), defined as Net Income / Shares Outstanding, increase after the acquisition closes?\n\nWill the acquirer’s valuation increase after it acquires the target company and properly integrates it?\n\nIs the acquirer paying a fair price for the target based on the financial metrics of both companies?\n\nIf the acquirer is issuing new stock (shares) to acquire the target, will each company own appropriate percentages after the deal closes?\n\nMerger models are designed to answer these types of questions.\n\nSimilar to valuations and DCF models, you do not need a company’s full Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement to build a merger model.\n\nYou just need the Income Statement and a partial Cash Flow Statement for the acquirer and the target:\n\nMore complex merger models often include the full financial statements, but they’re not required for a basic analysis.\n\nOther key assumptions include the price paid for the target, the form of consideration (Cash, Debt, or New Shares Issued), and the expected synergies (ways for the combined company to cut costs or increase sales).\n\nAs with all other financial models, a merger model is just one piece of evidence in the process of negotiating a deal.\n\nA company’s Board of Directors would never approve of an acquisition solely because of a merger model’s output.\n\nThere must be other perceived benefits, such as strategic, market, and competitive advantages from the deal.\n\nFor example, maybe the target company gives the acquirer access to a high-growth market that would have taken years to enter independently.\n\nOr maybe the target company has valuable intellectual property (IP) that the acquirer cannot easily develop on its own.\n\nM&A and Merger Model Examples\n\nYou can view a few sample M&A and merger model tutorials below:\n\nMerger Model Walkthrough: Combining the Income Statements\n\nMerger Model: Cash, Debt, and Stock Mix\n\nMerger Model Interview Questions: What to Expect\n\nThis last category is a variation on the first category (3-statement models).\n\nWe’re listing it separately because most people consider them separate, despite the similarities.\n\nIn leveraged buyout models (LBO models), the goal is to calculate the multiple or annualized rate of return you could earn by investing in a company, holding your stake, and eventually selling it.\n\nFor example, if a private equity firm acquires a company for $1 billion, operates it for 5 years, and sells it, could it potentially earn an average annualized return of 20%?\n\nOr would that require implausible assumptions, such as the company going from a 10% profit margin to a 30% margin within 5 years?\n\nThe full financial statements are not required for these models because the investment returns are linked primarily to the company’s cash flow and cash flow growth rate.\n\nAnd the “exit value” when the company is sold is usually linked to metrics that act as proxies for cash flow, such as EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).\n\nAs with the other models above, you start building an LBO model by projecting the company’s revenue, expenses, and cash flow line items.\n\nThese give you a sense of the company’s Free Cash Flow, or the cash it generates from its core business operations after paying for funding costs, such as interest on Debt:\n\nBased on the purchase price, the exit value, and the cash flows generated in the holding period, you can calculate the multiple of invested capital (MOIC) and the internal rate of return (IRR), also known as the average annualized return.\n\nThis model is known as an LBO model or leveraged buyout model because private equity firms use a combination of Debt and Equity to fund acquisitions of entire companies.\n\nIt’s similar to buying a home using a down payment and a mortgage, but on a much larger scale.\n\nThe private equity firm operates the company, uses the company’s cash flows to repay the Debt, and sells the company after several years.\n\nThe need to track this Debt repayment and the associated line items makes the Excel formulas more complex than those used in a standard 3-statement model.\n\nIf the private equity firm does not use Debt, the model is much simpler because you need only the cash flow projections, the purchase price, and the exit value.\n\nThis variation is often called a “growth equity model” or simply an “investment model.”\n\nRegardless of the model variation, though, the goal is always the same: determine plausible ranges for the multiple of invested capital and the annualized returns.\n\nYou can get example LBO models, growth equity models, and leveraged buyout tutorials below:\n\nGrowth Equity: Full Tutorial and Sample Case Study\n\nSimple LBO Model – Case Study and Tutorial\n\nIRR vs. Cash-on-Cash Multiples in Leveraged Buyouts and Investments\n\nIn addition to the categories above, there are also specialized financial models in industries such as commercial real estate, project finance, and infrastructure private equity.\n\nIn these industries, financial modeling is based 100% on cash flows rather than accounting profits, so the three financial statements are not used.\n\nRevenue and expense projections also differ significantly.\n\nFor example, in real estate financial modeling, revenue and expenses are based on individual tenants and the terms of their leases, including annual rent escalations, the expenses paid by the tenant, and the probability of leases expiring.\n\nIn project finance and infrastructure, the projections are often based on individual contracts as well – and there may be hundreds or thousands of them.\n\nAnother difference is that in addition to modeling the acquisitions of existing assets, you may also model new developments in both these industries.\n\nTo do that, you assume that a new development initially draws on Equity (i.e., cash from outside investors) and then switches to Debt once a funding threshold has been met.\n\nWhen the asset is under development, it does not generate cash flow, so the interest and fees on this Debt are capitalized.\n\nOnce the development is complete, a loan refinancing occurs, the construction lenders are repaid, and new lenders fund the stabilized asset.\n\nSpecialized Financial Models for Real Estate and Construction\n\nIf you want examples of these specialized models, please see our coverage below:\n\nReal Estate Financial Modeling\n\nThe Real Estate Pro-Forma\n\nInfrastructure Private Equity\n\nProject Finance Jobs\n\nThere are model variations in other industries as well.\n\nFor example, with oil & gas companies, the Net Asset Value (NAV) model is a variation of the traditional DCF analysis that does not have a Terminal Value – because oil & gas assets have limited economic lives.\n\nOnce enough oil or gas is extracted from a field, further extraction is no longer economically viable – even if some resources remain in the ground.\n\nThe asset is effectively “dead” until market conditions change.\n\nTherefore, you cannot assume that the asset will keep generating cash flows indefinitely into the future.\n\nWith banks and insurance companies, there are DCF variations such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) and the Embedded Value (EV) model for life insurance.\n\nThese models have some differences, but they still value companies based on their future cash flows or proxies for cash flow, such as dividends.\n\nIf you poke around online, you’ll see a wide range of opinions on the importance of financial modeling:\n\nSome people claim you need to know it perfectly, even for entry-level interviews and internships.\n\nOthers say that it’s overhyped and not that important; they point out that many groups are not especially technical and do not do much Excel-based modeling.\n\nAnd others say it’s only important for the “exit opportunities” following investment banking, such as private equity.\n\nAs usual, the truth is somewhere in the middle.\n\nYou do not need to know financial modeling “perfectly” for entry-level interviews and internships, but you do need a solid base of technical knowledge to be competitive.\n\nFor example, how do the 3 financial statements link together? How do you set up a DCF and use it to value a company? What are the trade-offs of different valuation methodologies?\n\nYou could memorize the answers to these questions, and that might work to some extent.\n\nBut the best way to mastery this technical knowledge is to learn and practice financial modeling. It’s the difference between passively listening to a foreign language and actively practicing by speaking and writing in that language.\n\nFinancial modeling matters less for the direct benefit and more for the indirect benefit of mastering the accounting, valuation, and transaction analysis concepts that you’ll be asked about in interviews.\n\nIt is true that certain groups in investment banking, such as equity capital markets, do not do much financial modeling work (they spend more time in PowerPoint and Word creating market updates).\n\nBut in interviews, they’re still going to test you on the key technical concepts.\n\nFinally, it’s also true that financial modeling is more important in some fields than it is in others.\n\nFor example, modeling skills do not matter much in early-stage venture capital investing because investing in startups is a much more qualitative process.\n\nAn early-stage startup does not have cash flows to model, and the founder’s personality and drive matter more than any spreadsheet.\n\nBut modeling skills matter more at late-stage VC firms and private equity firms since they invest in mature, established companies."
