        "text": "Alston & Bird has advised Platinum Equity in the financing of its acquisition of Cosmic Pet, an industry leader in innovative pet toys and accessories, from investment firm Guardian Capital Partners.\n\nThe acquisition combines Cosmic Pet with an existing portfolio company of Platinum Equity, Petmate, which manufactures, sources, and markets a diverse product line of pet-related products and accessories. Platinum Equity acquired Petmate in September 2021 in a deal in which Alston & Bird also advised on the financing.\n\nFounded in 1986 and headquartered in Wichita, KS, Cosmic Pet goes to market with highly recognizable brands and has won multiple industry awards for product development and design. In addition, the company also designs and markets high-quality pet hard-good products and consumables across multiple channels under a number of private-label brands, including Hyper Pet, Our Pets, Pet Zone, and Pet Fusion.\n\nPlatinum Equity is a global investment firm specializing in mergers, acquisitions, and operations. With approximately $25 billion in assets under management and a portfolio of approximately 50 operating companies, Platinum has completed more than 300 acquisitions over the last 25 years.\n\nThis is the fourth transaction by Platinum Equity in recent months for which Alston & Bird has advised on the financing. In addition to advising Platinum Equity on the acquisitions of Petmate and Cosmic Pet, the firm advised Platinum Equity on the financing of its acquisitions of Fifth Sun, a designer and distributor of custom screen-printed apparel, by portfolio company Mad Engine; Datalot, a digital marketing company, by portfolio company Centerfield; and Unical, a provider of aircraft parts, components, and services to the global aerospace market.\n\nAdvising Platinum Equity on the Cosmic Pet deal is an Alston & Bird Finance team led by partner Kevin Fink, senior associates Jonathan Forgang and Kayla Mehring, and associates Kyle Brumm and Sam Goldstein."
