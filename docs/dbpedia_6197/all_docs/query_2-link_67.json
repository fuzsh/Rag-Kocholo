        "text": "EIF is a leading financial institution in the European Private Equity market. Through our venture capital and private equity interventions, we play a crucial role in the creation and development of high-growth and innovative SMEs by facilitating access to equity for these companies across the entire life cycle of corporate innovation.\n\nWe do so by investing in venture and growth capital, from the very earliest stages of intellectual property development into technology transfer, to more mature phases of development.\n\nIn supporting both well-known and first time teams, we have built a strong track record in the industry. Through this reputation, while maintaining a highly selective process, we take significant minority stakes in funds which provide a catalytic effect on commitments from a wide range of investors, particularly in the private sector.\n\nThe scale and scope of our investments, along with our added value on fundraising, allows us to promote best market practice and corporate governance for teams we choose to support. EIF's equity activity is principally backed by resources from its main shareholders, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission.\n\nHow to contact us\n\nFor Private Equity and Venture Capital teams raising funds\n\nFor SMEs and entrepreneurs looking for finance\n\nFor all other enquiries, please use the online form"
