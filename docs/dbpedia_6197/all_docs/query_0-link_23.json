Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n“This strategic move allows Kohler to focus and invest in our global kitchen and bath, wellness, and hospitality businesses while also positioning the Energy business to reach its full potential under the ownership of Platinum Equity,” said David Kohler, Chair and CEO of Kohler Co.\n\n“I want to thank the entire Energy team, the performance of this business over the last three years has been remarkable. Exciting times are ahead, and Energy will forever have a special place in our company’s heritage.”\n\nBrian Melka is CEO of the Energy business, elevating his leadership role after more than a decade working at Kohler and driving the group’s growth and success. David Kohler serves on its board of directors.\n\n“We are excited for this next phase of Kohler Energy with Platinum Equity as a partner. The demand for resilient energy is growing, and the world needs much more of what we do,” Melka said.\n\n“Kohler has been an excellent steward of our business for more than 100 years, and this decision positions Kohler Energy to better deliver on that demand. Platinum Equity firmly supports our growth path ahead and can help further accelerate our progress in the global energy resilience industry.”\n\nPlatinum Equity is a global investment firm with more than $48 billion of assets under management and is an experienced partner in the industrial products sector.\n\n“Platinum is committed to strengthening Kohler Energy’s position as an industry leader and investing in development of a new generation of innovative energy resilience solutions,” said Platinum Equity Co-President Jacob Kotzubei.\n\n“We are excited about the prospects for the business, which has been at the forefront of energy resilience for more than a century.”\n\nKohler Energy provides solutions for home energy, industrial energy systems and powertrain technologies. Its portfolio of brands includes Power Systems, Home Energy, Kohler Uninterruptible Power, Clarke Energy, Heila Technologies, Curtis Instruments and Engines.\n\n“The energy resilience business has an outstanding leadership team, dedicated employees and an opportunity to capitalize on the tailwinds driving demand for reliable power solutions for individuals, businesses, and communities around the world,” said Platinum Equity Managing Director Matthew Louie.\n\n“We are thrilled to work with Brian and the management team to continue investing in the company’s human capital, infrastructure, customer and vendor partnerships and growth.”"
