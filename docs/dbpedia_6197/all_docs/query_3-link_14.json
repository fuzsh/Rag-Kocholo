        "text": "Dave Ramsey and his new fight with the Financial Supernerd First, I must admit that I am also a Financial Nerd, hahaha. Dave Ramsey is famous for being a financial education writer and content creator. He has helped thousands of people get out of debt. He has pointed out that if you have a portfolio of $1 MM, you could withdraw 8% annually or $80,000, and you would run the risk of running out of money. Unfortunately, it is not that simple; the stock market has managed to give good returns over time; everyone knows that it does not work as a fixed rate that will earn you every year. Perhaps you will be able to reach that return. Still, one year your performance will be negative, maybe another year of zero, and another year capable of being very good. Many complain about the 4% rule, which says you can withdraw 4% a year. Perhaps if it could be a little more, it has been, until now, one of the most conservative percentages to have a better chance that your capital Doesn't go down in time and get an income.

Inflation is on everyone‚Äôs mind right now, so I thought I'd share 5 ways to combat it: ‚úîÔ∏è TIPS: The principal of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increases with inflation and decreases with deflation. When a TIPS matures, you are paid the adjusted principal or original principal, whichever is greater. ‚úîÔ∏è Precious Metals Funds: The price of gold tends to increase during inflationary periods as the purchasing power of the dollar decreases. There are numerous precious metals funds that invest in gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. ‚úîÔ∏è Commodity Mutual Funds: Broadly speaking, the price of commodities tends to increase during periods of inflation. There are many mutual funds that invest in agricultural and energy commodities that can potentially benefit. ‚úîÔ∏è Equities / Equity Mutual Funds: Companies that are in inflationary-sensitive sectors like industrials and materials can potentially benefit in a higher inflation environment. There are specialty mutual funds that offer underlying equities within the fund‚Äôs portfolio. ‚úîÔ∏è Real Estate / REITs: Real Estate rentals and values tend to increase when prices do. REITs have attractive dividends that, according to Nareit, have outpaced inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index in all but two of the last twenty years. Feel free to share these tips with your friends and family! We could all use help riding out inflation.

Those who are concerned about running out of money too soon 2. Those who should be I can help the first group quickly and regularly do because they are open to a higher standard, but not a new fad. The first group refuses to go backward and down, only up. They will very often allow me to show them how they can produce the most reliable and repeatable Retirement possible so they Never Run Out of Money. Then they can decide for themselves if they prefer guarantees to hopes by gambling. I can help the second group when they are ready and willing to understand their risks and reasons they should be concerned about RUNNING OUT OF MONEY which are sometimes hidden and sometimes they may reject a higher standard. They are often so bought into their current process that they are resistant to learning if there is possibly something better than the binary model they believe. That resistance if not broken will take them too long and too far to change. When those who come to understand realize it, they say, \"I wish I had started 20 years ago.\" I have started people as late as 87 because they realize they want the most for their future whenever they can start. SECRET SAUCE: Let me start you with this, your money can double about 14 times in a lifetime. Every seven years your inventory of opportunities doubles declines. The stock market declines every 5-7 years by over 40% on average and takes 1.5 years down and 3-5 years up to BE. causing another loss of inventory. This is intentional by Wall Street. Once those in this group realize they can't go back and make a new yesterday, they can still make a new tomorrow by raising the standard. TIME is the DISGUISED priority by the Wall Street Masters. TIME is the only unrecoverable commodity. Once understood, the TIME is now! NOT DELAY. That is why no one can be talked into the STEPPED UP FLOOR, that never goes down. You are ready or you are not.
