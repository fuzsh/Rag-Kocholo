        "text": "What Is Negative Cash Flow and How Long Can You Operate With It?\n\nIf you want to build a successful company, youâll need to make more money than you spend. At least, thatâs the long-term goal. But many business owners find they have to operate in the red (i.e., spend more than they make) at times.\n\nNegative cash flow isnât necessarily a bad thing if youâre following a plan. However, you want to avoid running out of cash entirely. To avoid this situation or simply to improve your business cash flow, you may want to consider exploring available business funding sources.\n\nWhat is negative cash flow?\n\nNegative cash flow is when more money is flowing out of a business than into the business during a specific period. Positive cash flow is simply the opposite â more money is flowing in than flowing out.\n\nWhile the concept is straightforward, tracking the movement of money through a business can get complicated. If you have a small business accounting system in place, you can quickly generate a cash flow statement. Along with your balance sheet and profit and loss statement, these make up the main three financial statements for a business.\n\nWhat is an example of negative cash flow?\n\nPeriods of negative cash flow are common and sometimes expected. As the saying goes, you have to spend money to make money.\n\nFor instance, a brand-new business might not make enough money to support itself at the start. Therefore, many entrepreneurs need business funding to start and grow their companies. Famously, some tech startups even can go years before making a profit.\n\nItâs not as realistic for small businesses to last years without turning a profit. But hopefully the initial investments will pay off, and the company will become profitable.\n\nSeasonal businesses also commonly have predictable periods of negative cash flow. A well-known beach town restaurant might make most of its profits during the summer months. Once the busy season wraps up, the restaurant might have much lower labor and supply costs. However, it still may need to take out a business loan or dip into savings to cover the rest of its operating costs during the off-season.\n\nHow does negative cash flow affect a business?\n\nNegative cash flow can make running a business more difficult in the short term. The pressure to cut corners can build if youâre watching your business bank account slowly dwindle â this can have long-term negative consequences on your finances.\n\nFor example, you might not be able to invest in quality equipment, resulting in spending more money to replace or repair the equipment later. Or you might decide to wait to hire more staff or launch a marketing campaign, which might perpetuate the problem if you then run into staffing shortages or struggle to increase sales.\n\nIf you continue to lose money, you may have to lay off employees, forgo your own paychecks, fall behind on payments to vendors and creditors â or even shut down.\n\nIs it OK to have negative cash flow?\n\nOperating with negative cash flow isnât necessarily a bad thing. Even giant, international and world-famous corporations operate at a loss for some months or years. Sometimes, they even lose money and experience negative cash flow on purpose to invest in something that will produce massive profits in the future.\n\nHere are a few situations that can cause a company to experience negative cash flow, even though the company isnât necessarily in a bad place:\n\nPurchasing large business\n\nSpending money to open a new\n\nCreating a new product line or service\n\nLaunching a marketing\n\nRamping up for a busy\n\nIn these cases, the companies are following a plan that requires an initial investment. If theyâre measuring their cash flow over a given month or quarter, they might record negative cash flow for that period. But itâs a strategic decision to invest in the business.\n\nIn contrast, negative cash flow can become an issue when you donât have a plan or strategy. If youâre unexpectedly in the red due to declining sales, unpaid invoices or increased expenses, youâll need to figure out how to improve cash flow.\n\nHow long can you operate with negative cash flow?\n\nYou can operate with negative cash flow so long as you have cash reserves or access to small business funding to continue operations.\n\nStartups, which commonly operate at a loss initially, often track their cashflow runway, meaning how long they can last with negative cash flow until they run out of money. They also track their burn rate, which is how quickly theyâre losing money.\n\nTo find these for your own business, you can:\n\nFigure out how much cash you have on\n\nCalculate how much money youâre losing each month (your burn rate).\n\nDivide your cash by your burn\n\nFor example, if youâre burning $5,000 a month and have $60,000 in reserves, your runway is about 12 months.\n\nHowever, your burn rate and runway arenât set in stone. If youâre worried about running out of money, you may be able to extend your runway or completely switch things around and have positive cash flow by increasing your income or lowering your expenses.\n\nHow to improve cash flow\n\nCash flow depends entirely on three things: money coming in, money going out, and the timing of these transactions. Youâll need to focus on at least one of those areas if you want to improve your cash flow.\n\nHere are a few steps you can consider to improve your cash flow:\n\nRaise prices: Increasing your prices may seem counter-intuitive when youâre worried about losing customers, but sometimes itâs necessary to stay in\n\nLook for ways to increase sales: Consider how you might spur new Perhaps you can try a new product or service, promotions, discounts, or marketing campaign.\n\nCut operating expenses: See if you can decrease your monthly costs by making your business more Perhaps you can shop for new business insurance plans, negotiate discounts with suppliers, and cut energy costs.\n\nAsk vendors about terms: While it wonât save money overall, a terms account lets you pay for invoices over time. Having more time can help you align your income and expenses to smooth your cash flow.\n\nDonât delay sending invoices: Review your invoicing methods to minimize collection When customers pay on terms, you can offer a small discount to incentivize them to send you the payment sooner."
