        "text": "LOS ANGELES (August 6, 2024) – Platinum Equity announced today the acquisition of ASP Global, a leading strategic partner to the healthcare industry that develops, sources and distributes consumable medical products for healthcare providers and distributors.\n\nFinancial terms were not disclosed.\n\nBased in Atlanta, ASP leverages its global sourcing network to provide high-quality products that are customized to meet the specific needs of health systems, labs, GPOs and distributors.
