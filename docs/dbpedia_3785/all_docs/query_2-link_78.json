The Emigrants received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Actress, Director, and Adapted Screenplay—rare honors for a foreign film. Ullmann, often identified with Bergman’s films, has said Kristina is her favorite role. Among the many distinctive qualities of Troell’s cinema is the fact that he is the cinematographer of his own films and enjoys the freedom that comes with the dual role of director-cinematographer.\n\n—Richard Peterson, Christopher B.
