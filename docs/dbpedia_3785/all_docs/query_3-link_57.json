        "text": "The film, shot primarily in Swedish, was initially released in Sweden in 1971 under the title Utvandrarna, which was translated as The Emigrants when it was released in the United States in 1972. The original running time of 191 minutes was edited to 151 minutes for the American release.\n\nIn the opening credits, a written prologue described the parish of Ljuder, Sweden in which the Nilsson family lives, including the exact count of landowners, tenant farmers and soldiers, idiots, prostitutes and others. The prologue also noted that the deacon of the church, sheriff, biggest landowner and church warden ruled the community by virtue of their station, as was the case in most of Sweden in 1844. A written prologue before the closing credits stated that the Nilssons’ arrival in America was only the beginning of their immigration and that the film The New Land will continue their story as they learn to tame the land and prosper. Director Jan Troell's onscreen credit reads: \"A film by\" and then again as: \"Directed, Photographed and Edited by.\"\n\nThe Emigrants and its sequel, The New Land, were based on the four novels by Wilhelm Moberg entitled Utvandrarna, Invandrarna, Nybyggarna and Sista brevet till Sverige about a Swedish family's immigration to the United States in the mid-1800s, fleeing starvation and religious persecution. The books, published between 1949 and 1959 in Stockholm, were widely read by the Swedish public. The 28 Apr 1971 Var review noted that, because of the Swedish public’s familiarity with the books, the characters in the film needed no introduction in Sweden, but when the film was released in the United States, the American audience had some difficulty discerning them.\n\nSeveral reviews noted that The Emigrants and The New Land, at a cost of over five million Swedish kronor, were the most expensive Swedish films ever made and broke Swedish box-office records. Both were shot between 18 Feb 1969 and 14 Jan 1970, in Sweden and the United States. American locations included train and steamboat scenes shot in North Freedom, Cassville and Marine on St. Croix, WI and Lake Ki-Chi-Saga scenes in Itasca County, MN. According to a 10 Sep 1969 Var article, assistance in shooting on location in America was provided by Reid H. Ray Film Industries in St. Paul, MN. The 10 Sep 1969 Var article noted that the New York dock scene was recreated at a Copenhagen location and added shooting locations in Chicago and Minneapolis. According to a 11 Sep 1969 DV article, portions of the film were also shot in Milton, WI.\n\nMany of the same cast and crew were used on both The Emigrants and The New Land, including actor Eddie Axberg, who played “Robert” and was also a sound man on the films. Linn Ullman, who played one of the children in both films, was the daughter of Liv Ullman and Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. An 11 Sep 1969 DV article included Laurie McMillan, a “youngster from Milton,” WI in the cast; however, her appearance in the film has not been confirmed.\n\nReviews also noted that the American release had English subtitles; however, the viewed print, which was a commercial DVD, was dubbed into English, except for scenes in which Robert, “Arvid,” “Elin” and others practice English with one another and try to speak it upon arriving in America.\n\nSeveral reviews lauded Max von Sydow and Ullmann’s performances, much of which was communicated through gesture, with minimal dialogue. In 1971, the Swedish release received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1972, the American release of the film received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actress (Ullmann), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay (Troell and Bengt Forslund). According to a 28 Apr 1971 Var article, the film was accepted by the Cannes Film Festival; however, when the filmmakers were asked to shorten the film, they refused and withdrew their entry.\n\nLess\n\nIn 1844 Småland, Sweden, the parish of Ljuder is populated with several hundred peasant farmers, both small landowners and tenant farmers, making a meager living from the barren land. While the church threatens eternal damnation from the pulpit, the church pastor, churchwarden, sheriff and a wealthy landowner mete out unjust punishments for those who do not obey their laws. The Nilsson family, like many others, toils endlessly with little hope. When Father Nilsson's foot is crushed under a boulder, his eldest son, Karl Oskar, assumes sole responsibility for the farm. Soon after, Karl marries young Kristina and starts a farm beside his parents’ home. Working over twelve hours a day, Kristina and Karl’s mother busily tend animals, cook and clean, while Karl tends the fields. Although Karl’s mother disapproves of his playful new bride, Kristina does her share of the work and bears her husband three children. Bad weather, bringing both flood and drought, destroys year after year of harvests, forcing the couple into debt. When Kristina suggests that they refrain from sex so there will be fewer mouths to feed, Karl, although bitter about their fate, humors his wife into sharing one of their few joys. The next spring, Karl’s carefree, fifteen-year-old brother Robert is sent to work as an indentured farmhand for master Aron, who regularly beats him for daydreaming. Robert bunks there with farmhand Arvid, a gregarious but awkward boy who spends his pay on alcohol. Each night, Arvid plays with his one fine possession, a pocket watch, while Robert reads out loud from books about the plentiful land in North America and the Swedish feudal caste system. Tired of the humiliation and endless work days, one night Arvid threatens to kill Aron’s wife, but Robert wrestles the axe away from the drunken boy and soothes him with his secret. Robert confides that he plans to run away to America, where he claims there are no classes, and invites the boy to join him on his voyage across the ocean. In the fall, drought, a burnt barn and broken plow destroy the Nilssons' hopes of a tolerable winter. When Kristina insinuates that her husband’s growing resentment is a result of the amount of children they have, Karl, valuing his family above all else, lovingly suggests that they must keep peace between each other in order to survive. Meanwhile, Robert suffers more beatings from Aron, including a blow to the head that causes him excruciating earaches. Running away to the Nilsson farm, Robert refuses to finish out his year contract with Aron. When Karl confronts Aron, the owner’s cruel indifference causes Karl to insult the man. Shortly after, the sheriff warns Karl that Robert must leave the district, prompting the boy to announce that he will sell his share in the farm to go to America. Karl agrees that the articles about America’s equality and fertile land have intrigued him as well and considers accompanying his brother. Kristina, worried that as the first immigrants from the area, their inexperience will endanger the children, refuses the suggestion. Meanwhile, Karl’s uncle, fundamentalist preacher Danjel Andresson, is persecuted by the malicious church pastor and his churchwarden for giving communion to his small band of followers including reformed prostitute Ulrika, her illegitimate daughter Elin and several paupers. Stating that Danjel is not ordained, they exile him from the district despite the devout preacher’s retort that the church officials sell liquor that causes sinful behavior. An outraged and righteous Ulrika shouts at the “pot-bellied” town pastor and churchwarden, who, she reminds them, has paid for her services before. Later that winter, Karl and Kristina’s little girl Anna sneaks a handful of uncooked porridge and dies when her stomach bursts from the swelling grain. Grief and another season of bad crops prompt the family to make plans to leave their homeland. As the departure date approaches, Robert reads to the family, embellishing his tales of equality and wealth in America. Meanwhile, Danjel tells Karl and Kristina that God has told him to join the Nilssons' voyage. One spring day, neighbors watch as Robert, Arvid, Karl and Kristina and their children, followed by Danjel, his wife Inga-Lena and their children, servants and followers, leave on wagons loaded with trunks of provisions. During the journey to the port, Danjel assures his faithful that no harm, including seasickness, will come to them because of their belief. When they reach the ocean days later, the group is hurriedly boarded on the frigate Charlotta with dozens of peasant immigrants. After setting sail, they are soon disillusioned by the crew’s constant derision, poor food rations and fetid, cramped quarters. One day, Kristina is mortified to find lice on her body and loudly blames Ulrika, the “whore,” for the infestation. Danjel and Karl’s attempts to quiet the screaming women are unheeded until Ulrika gladly strips to prove her point, while the meek and devout Inga-Lena admits that she has lice. After the passengers spend hours scrubbing their bodies and clothes to rid themselves of the pests, a storm rocks the boat causing all, including Danjel, to experience debilitating seasickness. The worsening conditions kill an old man who is traveling with his wife to their son Anders’ farm in Minnesota. The sea finally calms, but Inga-Lena confides in Kristina that she suffers dizziness and bloody diarrhea, signs of scurvy, and refuses to tell Danjel for fear of injuring his faith further. Meanwhile, Danjel claims the ship is being saved from certain doom only to transport the one virtuous person on board, Ulrika, who has had neither lice nor sickness. One night, a gushing nosebleed leaves Kristina weak and fearing for her life. Seeing her deteriorate from fatigue, Karl asks his wife to forgive him for their immigration to America, but Kristina reminds him that they chose together to better their life. As she fades off to sleep, they both smile, savoring the friendship that has brought them so close. The next morning, Kristina has recovered, but Inga-Lena dies, leaving Danjel to pray for her safe passage to heaven. After many weeks on the sea, the Charlotta arrives at a bustling New York port, overwhelming the immigrants with hundreds of people speaking foreign languages. Resting on grass-covered solid ground, the Nilssons rejoice, drinking milk and eating apples. With plans to settle in Minnesota near Anders, the group cautiously boards a train, fearful of the gigantic steel contraption sputtering steam. Most of the passengers are easily tricked into buying fake remedies with their new American money, including Danjel who is reassured to find the coins are imprinted with “in God we trust.” Rejuvenated by the sights, Robert and Arvid vow to stay together on their voyage, while Kristina offers bread to Ulrika as a gesture of peace. Boarding a steamship days later, Kristina is surprised to see gentry on the upper deck and slaves in the hull. When she questions Robert, whose claims of equality now appear false, he explains that there are two kinds of people in America, those who have been here long enough to be rich and the newly arrived, who have yet to acquire wealth. Tension builds between Ulrika and Karl, who has become the de facto leader of the group, when Karl’s estimates about the distance to Minnesota come into question. However, during a brief docking where Karl and Kristina’s daughter Marta is lost, the motherly Ulrika finds the child, earning the parents’ endearing gratitude. Realizing that the boat’s gruel is making them sick, the group protests the gentry’s fresh meals, but to no avail. By the time they reach their destination, Danjel’s daughter has died and the group has grown weak. Their initial attempts to ask in English for directions to Taylor’s Falls are repeatedly misinterpreted, until a kindly man explains the route and, inviting them into his home, feeds the group a hearty meal. After days of walking through the forest, they reach Anders’ home, a modest barn beside Lake Ki-Chi-Saga. Although Danjel and his group stake land in the immediate vicinity, Karl, having already traveled thousands of miles, walks a few more and, using a stick to check the depth of fertile soil, decides upon a piece of land along the lake’s shore, then happily rests under the tree he has marked to stake his claim.\n\nLess"
