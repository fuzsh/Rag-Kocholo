        "text": "From “High Noon” to “Silkwood” and “The Insider,” the courageous loner who stands up to evil at great personal risk is a familiar film figure. Now the Swedish master Jan Troell has added to that gallery with “The Last Sentence,” his portrait of Torgny Segerstedt, a Swedish newspaper editor who was an early, ferocious and persistent critic of Hitler, defying both Nazi threats and his own government’s pleas not to undermine its neutral stance.\n\nBut “The Last Sentence,” which opens Friday, is anything but a hagiography. The rectitude and fearlessness of Segerstedt’s public stances contrasted sharply with a messy and conflicted private life, which Mr. Troell also mines: Segerstedt was haunted by his mother’s early death, treated his wife with indifference, even cruelty, and flaunted his relationship with a morphine-addicted mistress who was the wife of his closest friend.\n\nIt was precisely that “division between the one you want to be and the one you are, and the judgment you put on yourself for not being the one you wanted to be” that made the project attractive when he was first approached about it, Mr. Troell said in a Skype interview last month from his home in Smygehamn, the southernmost town in Sweden. “You want to do the good, but you do bad things,” he added, “and I think Segerstedt,” a theology student as a young man, “had a very hard struggle with his conscience.”\n\nTo play the complicated characters he had in mind when he wrote the script with the Danish novelist and poet Klaus Rifbjerg, Mr. Troell assembled an all-star Scandinavian cast. The Danish actor Jesper Christensen, perhaps best known as a villain in the James Bond capers “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace,” was cast as Segerstedt, with Pernilla August of Sweden, who plays Shmi Skywalker in the “Star Wars” series, as his mistress and the Swedish comedian Ulla Skoog as Segerstedt’s long-suffering, Norwegian-born wife."
