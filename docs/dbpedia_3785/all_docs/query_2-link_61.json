        "text": "Har Har du Ditt Liv/ Here's Your Life (1966), tratto da un romanzo di Eyvind Johnson, descrive l'educazione morale di un adolescente vagabondo durante la guerra. Lirico, paesaggistico e introspettivo, prelude alla riduzione cinematografica della saga contadina di Vilhelm Moberg, un affresco epico sulla vita quotidiana degli emigranti sconvolge i canoni eroici del cinema americano sui pionieri.\n\nOle Dole Doff/ Who Saw Him Die (1968) racconta il difficile rapporto fra un maestro che tenta di bandire l'autoritarismo da scuola e la moglie con cui vive senza figli.\n\nThe historical epic Utvandrarna/ The Emigrants (1971) and its sequel Nybyggarna/ The New Land (1972) are based upon the novels of Vilhelm Moberg that tell the story of Swedish emigrants to the USA.\n\nElevato ad erede naturale di Sjostrom, Troell emigra a Hollywood e gira Zandy's Bride (1974) dove, riprendendo il tema dei pionieri, descrive la vita di una svedese sposatasi con un rozzo allevatore che la considera poco più che un oggetto ma che alla fine dovrà riconoscerne i diritti.\n\nBang (1977) abbandona l'epos e ritorna all'introspezione (un insegnante di mezza età).\n\nHurricane (1979) is a remake of an old John Ford movie.\n\nIngenjor Andrees Luftfard/ Flight of the Eagle (1982) is about a historical failed Arctic balloon expedition of 1897.\n\nIl Capitano (1991) is another historical reconstruction.\n\nTroell now clearly specialized in biopics: Hamsun (1996) was followed by Sa Vit Som en Sno/ As White as in Snow (2001), which was followed by Maria Larssons Eviga Ogonblick/ Everlasting Moments (2008), an elegant period piece. In 1907 Maria is a good wife and mother who works hard to raise her children, including Maja. Her husband, unfortunately, is a drunkard who causes her much grief. One day Maria finds a camera and starts using it with the help of the local photographer. Meanwhile Sogge joins the socialists and goes on strike, spending his time at the pub where he also cheats on Maria with the waitress. When the anarchists carry out a terrorist attack, he realizes that the waitress is involved but instead the authorities arrest him for hitting her. Seven years later the family is still struggling and Maria has had enough of Sogge. The photographer, a divorced man, gives her a flower. Their affection is secret and never spoken. Sogge, however, seeing a photo of his wife taken by the photographer, understands what is going on. Maria takes the children to see a film and is mesmerized by the new technology. Sogge, even more jealous, beats Maria. While Sogge is in jail for his violent behavior, Maja is old enough to be employed by two old siblings. When the sister is away, the man tries to rape Maja. Maria cannot pay rent but the landlord asks her to take a photo of his shop. Sogge returns a reformed man just when Maja falls in love with Gunnar and the photographer has to move to another town. Sogge helps Maria open a photography studio and the family is finally happy."
