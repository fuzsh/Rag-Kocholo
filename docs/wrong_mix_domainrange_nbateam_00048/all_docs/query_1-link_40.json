        "text": "CHARLOTTE -- Wednesday night, the Charlotte Hornets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 122-113. The Hornets didn’t play their best defensive game, as Anthony Davis scored 40, and in the second half they went through a cold stretch from the 3-point line, but they found a way to win their fifth straight, and over the course of the weekend extended that win streak to seven.\n\n“The thing about the NBA, is there’s a disaster waiting around every corner,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said following the game.\n\nHe was referring to the ups-and-downs in the course of 48 minutes. The inevitable runs from the opponent teams have to absorb and shooting dry spells they have to grind through.\n\nBut the Charlotte coach’s statement is probably true on a larger scale as well. In the course of the regular season, the playoffs, the trade deadline, the draft lottery and free agency, there’s always going to be a disaster around every corner. In Charlotte, they include the Lance Stephenson experiment gone wrong to Michael Kidd-Gilchrist’s injuries.\n\nThe disasters send bad teams reeling. The good teams find ways to adapt and change their style. The difference this year as Charlotte hones in on the playoffs? The Hornets find themselves in the latter category.\n\n----\n\nThe reason the Hornets are here, with a 37-28 record, eyeing the franchise’s third playoff appearance in the last twelve years - is partly by design.\n\nClifford knew at the beginning of this season the Hornets needed to adapt to the changing NBA game. He was an assistant coach for five seasons in Orlando, where Stan Van Gundy was one of the pioneers of the “four-out” offense, spreading the floor with shooters around a dominant big man in Dwight Howard and raining 3-pointers on the opposition if it doubled the post.\n\nSince that stretch with the Magic, the league has moved even more toward smaller lineups and prioritizing 3-pointers. This offseason, Charlotte added Nic Batum and Jeremy Lamb in trades, drafted Frank Kaminsky, and picked up Jeremy Lin in free agency, all with the goal of spacing the floor with shooters around penetration or post-ups in the paint.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hornets players who were on the roster last year changed their games. Power forward Marvin Williams took 265 3-pointers last year, hitting 36 percent. This season, he’s already up to 299 attempts, and he’s shot them better - knocking down 40 percent of those shots.\n\n“The biggest (adjustment) for me is taking more shots to be honest with you. Last year, I was trying to figure out where I was going to get them, and if this was a great shot or not,” Williams said. “This summer, I watched a ton of film and put in a ton of work. My shooting has definitely improved and that’s really helped.”\n\nThe increase in volume and efficiency from 3 has transformed the Hornets from terrible offensively to very good. Last year, the team’s true shooting percentage was 49.8 percent, second to last in the NBA. This season, it’s up to 54.4 percent, 12th in the league and fourth in the east.\n\nComing into the season, the Hornets had made 15 or more 3-pointers in a game just once in the history of the Hornets/Bobcats franchise -- a hot-shooting night in 1997 when Glen Rice, Tony Delk and Ricky Pierce went off against the Boston Celtics. This year, the team has made 15 3-pointers in six games, including twice in the past week against the Pelicans and the Houston Rockets.\n\nClifford likes to see those 3-pointers come off penetration to the lane or to an open man off the pick-and-roll. But as long as the offense is flowing the way he wants it to flow, he’s never going to question his players’ decision to let it fly.\n\n“Stan (Van Gundy)’s whole thing, and I totally agree with it, if you start saying ‘Oh don’t shoot that one,’ then there’s hesitancy on their part and I don’t want that. I want them shooting free and easy,” Clifford said.\n\n-------\n\nThe Hornets have shot the ball freely and easily all season, but the way the team has gotten those shots might not be the way Clifford predicted it in the preseason.\n\nAl Jefferson, the centerpiece of the Hornets’ offense down low and a nightmare in the post-up game for opposing defenses, was supposed to be the hub around which the other four players spread out. But the big man went down with an injury in December, and was inactive for 25 games, only returning for good in mid-February.\n\nInstead of Jefferson finding 3-point shooters off double-teams in the post-up game, the most dangerous action for the Hornets’ offense has become the Cody Zeller pick and roll. Zeller’s not as much of a scoring threat as Jefferson, but when he sets a screen for Kemba Walker or Nic Batum and careens to the hoop like a car with a cinder block on the gas pedal, he sucks defenses into the paint and opens the floor for the shooters.\n\n“No one expected Al to miss as much time as he did. The way Cody has stepped into the role has been amazing. I feel like he’s really the one guy that makes it work,” Williams said. “He’s such a great pick and roll player, he sets screens and rolls hard all the time. He’s a great finisher a great passer, Cody is the one guy who makes the whole four-out deal work,” Williams said.\n\nAdded Clifford, \"It's not that posting the ball is not good. Look, Golden State posts quite a bit. It's just that spacing is everything. The more you can space the floor, the better shot you can get.”\n\nKidd-Gilchrist’s injuries have taken away the Hornets’ best individual defender for the majority of the season, but the fourth-year forward out of Kentucky is not a 3-point threat -- he’s attempted just 25 in his career. With trade deadline addition Courtney Lee taking his place in the starting five, there’s no one for opposing to defenses to help off when Zeller and Walker run a pick-and-roll at the top, allowing the point guard to split defenders and veer to the rim or, if the defense tries to trap, find a shooter on the perimeter.\n\nIn another Hornets season, the Kidd-Gilchrist and Jefferson injuries would be the disasters that would sink Charlotte back into the muck of the lottery. Instead, the Hornets have found ways to change their style and, through unfortunate circumstance, find a formula that works in today’s NBA. There’s probably another disaster waiting around the next corner, but this year, the team appears prepared to take it in stride."
