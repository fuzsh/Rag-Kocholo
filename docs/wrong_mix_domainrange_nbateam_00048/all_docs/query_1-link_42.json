        "text": "NBA Regular Season 2012-2013, Game 2:\n\nUtah Jazz (1-0) @ New Orleans Hornets (0-1)\n\nJazz @ Hornets Game Stream -- Jazz vs Hornets coverage -- At The Hive:\n\n.\n\nThe new look Hornets played a tough game against the San Antonio Spurs two nights ago, falling to the four time NBA Champions 95-99. The Hornets were up at halftime 50-43. They were led by 2012 NBA Draft, Pick #1 Anthony Davis -- who had 21 points (50 fg%, 9/9 FT) and 7 rebounds. Al-Farouq Aminu played like a lotto pick and added 17 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 blocks, and 2 steals. Ryan Anderson and Austin Rivers had disappointing shooting nights that they'd want to exorcise tonight, the two guys known for shooting went a combined 4/19 against the Spurs.\n\nThe Jazz added three point making, and have increased the speed at which they play at. This has taken the ball out of the hands of Al Jefferson. Against this Hornets team, though, I wouldn't mind seeing our bigs pound them into the earth. Derrick Favors and Enes Kanter are bigger than their bench bigs; and stronger by a mile. And Paul Millsap is coming home -- and I can expect him to show up.\n\n.\n\nProbable Starters:\n\nThis is the first game on our three game road trip that will also see us play the San Antonio Spurs (tomorrow night), and the Memphis Grizzlies (Monday). It's three games in four nights, and the only \"easy\" game on paper. We can't drop this.\n\nAs an aside, Hornets fans -- really crappy about that news about Eric Gordon. Hope he gets well soon."
