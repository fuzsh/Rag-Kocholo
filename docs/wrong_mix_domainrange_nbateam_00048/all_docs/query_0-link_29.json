Like I’ve said all along, Al’s played like an all-star. Al deserves to be an all-star. Whether or not he makes the team, that’s up to somebody else.”\n\nAll-star reserves were announced this evening on TNT. Fan voting determined the starters, who were previously announced.\n\nOriginally Published: January 28, 2009 at 11:01 p.m."
