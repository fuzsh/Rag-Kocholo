        "text": "BOSTON — Charlotte forward Al Jefferson hasn't played for the Celtics since the 2006-07 season, but he still openly roots for the local team. No, not the Celtics. The Patriots.\n\nJefferson, 28, signed a three-year, $41 million contract with the Bobcats last summer as a free agent, so he's in Carolina Panthers territory now.\n\nThe Panthers will host the Patriots Monday night and Jefferson is taking heat about the game from Carolina fans. Fortunately for him, not everyone on the Bobcats roots for the Panthers.\n\n\"You've got Cowboy fans,\" Jefferson said before the Bobcats played the Celtics Wednesday at the TD Garden. \"You've got New York Giants fans, which I hate. I catch a little grief for my Patriots, but Carolina is my second team. I support the home team, but I'm a diehard Patriots fan.\"\n\nThe Celtics went 24-58, including an 18-game losing streak, during Jefferson's third and final season in Boston.\n\n\"I try to forget about it,\" Jefferson admitted. \"It was a rebuilding year, that's all I can say. It was a lot of long nights.\"\n\nSome fans are rooting for the Celtics to lose this season to improve their chances in the draft lottery. Jefferson heard that during his last year in Boston.\n\n\"I heard it,\" he said. \"That's why I don't have no comment on it, but I know guys, professional guys, don't go out and play to lose. I know that for a fact. Everybody wants to win.\"\n\nJefferson finally beat the Celtics on Wednesday. Entering the night, he was 0-11 against them since he was traded to Minnesota for Kevin Garnett prior to the 2007-08 season.\n\nJefferson missed much of the preseason and five of the team's first seven regular-season games with a sprained ankle.\n\n\"It's part of the game,\" he said. \"It was a freak accident — came down on somebody's foot. It could have happened to anybody. It's just all about bouncing back and recovering from it and getting back with my team.\"\n\nWhy did Jefferson sign with Charlotte?\n\n\"For the record, being a free agent is not fun,\" he said. \"It's overrated. Nothing like I thought it would be. Charlotte was the team that showed interest in me and wanted me to be a part of their team. To me, that's all I needed.\"\n\nJefferson gets to work with former Knicks center Patrick Ewing, the Bobcats' associate head coach.\n\n\"Yeah, he still thinks he can play,\" he said. \"I'm going to get him out there on that block and show him what the new school is about. But he's been very helpful to me, especially on the defensive end.\"\n\nSullinger hurting\n\nBoston's Jared Sullinger warmed up before the game but sat out with a bone bruise in his right knee. Sullinger hurt the knee Monday when he took a charge from Orlando's Maurice Hawkins.\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens said Kris Humphries, who played only 46 minutes in Boston's first eight games, would get Sullinger's minutes. Humphries had 9 points and 5 rebounds in only 18½ minutes at Miami Saturday, and didn't play Monday against Orlando.\n\nStevens has gone with younger players with an eye toward the future. Humphries' contract is up at the end of the season and the Celtics don't figure to re-sign him.\n\n\"I thought he's played great,\" Stevens said. \"I really think at the end of the day, he's a guy that's been there, done that. He's done a great job rebounding. He's done a great job scoring. He's been a consummate pro, which I really appreciate.\"\n\n\"I've felt good as of lately,\" Humphries said. \"It's been different. I was playing a lot of center. I haven't really played a lot of center to this point in my career. Just adjusting, also adjusting to my teammates and a new coaching system, but all those things considered, it's very simple for me. Be in shape, be ready, play hard — that's it.\"\n\nContact Bill Doyle at wdoyle@telegram.com. Follow him on Twitter @BillDoyle15."
