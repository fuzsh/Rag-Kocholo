        "text": "Minnesota Timberwolves agreed to send power forward Al Jefferson to the Utah Jazz for center Kosta Koufos and two future first-round draft picks.\n\nTimberwolves president David Kahn said the first-round picks and the added flexibility under the salary cap made it the right time to trade Jefferson, who will help fill a void in Utah after Carlos Boozer went to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nYesterday’s deal also included a traded player exception for salary-cap flexibility for Minnesota.\n\nJefferson came to the Timberwolves in 2007 as the main cog in the blockbuster deal that sent Kevin Garnett to the Celtics. He averaged 23.1 points and 11 rebounds in the 50 games before he was injured in 2009.\n\nJefferson averaged 17.1 points and 9.3 rebounds last season in his first year back from that major knee injury. But the Wolves signed center Darko Milicic, agreed to terms with center Nikola Pekovic and traded for Michael Beasley to reshape a small front line into a bigger, and sleeker, unit.\n\nIn the end, Jefferson was expendable.\n\nIlgauskas to Heat\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas is following LeBron James to the Miami Heat. Agent Herb Rudoy said the veteran center expects to sign a two-year contract this week.\n\nRudoy said Ilgauskas told Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert and Cavaliers general manager Chris Grant of his decision.\n\nThe 7-3 Ilgauskas was selected by Cleveland with the 20th pick in the 1996 NBA draft. For his career, he averaged 13.8 points and 7.7 rebounds, and played in two All-Star games. . . .\n\nThe New York Knicks signed Russian center Timofey Mozgov.\n\nChandler change\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats completed a wild 24 hours of trade discussions with a deal that does include center Tyson Chandler after all. He’s just not heading to the team he thought a day earlier.\n\nAfter a potential trade with Toronto fell apart, the Bobcats sent Chandler and fellow center Alexis Ajinca to the Dallas Mavericks for center Erick Dampier, forward Eduardo Najera, shooting guard Matt Carroll and cash.\n\nThe 7-foot-1 Chandler, acquired from New Orleans for Emeka Okafor last season, spent one injury-riddled season in Charlotte. The Bobcats had been closing in on a deal that would’ve sent Chandler and Boris Diaw to Toronto for Jose Calderon and Reggie Evans.\n\nThe Mavericks also signed first-round draft pick Dominique Jones, the 6-4, 215-pound guard out of South Florida, and 6-11 free-agent center Ian Mahinmi. . . .\n\nThe New Jersey Nets acquired guard Anthony Morrow in a sign-and-trade deal with the Golden State Warriors. The deal was completed a day after the Nets handed Morrow an offer sheet on a three-year, $12 million contract. The Warriors get the Nets’ second-round 2011 draft pick.\n\nSpurs sign Bonner\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs finalized a new contract with forward Matt Bonner, their 3-point specialist who hit 39 percent from behind the arc. . . .\n\nBackup center Hilton Armstrong signed a free-agent contract with the Washington Wizards. . . .\n\nThe Houston Rockets reached an agreement with first-round draft pick Patrick Patterson, the 6-9, 236-pound forward from Kentucky. . . .\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers signed guard Willie Warren, a second-round pick out of Oklahoma.\n\nHornets GM out\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets and general manager Jeff Bower “mutually agreed” to part ways immediately. The Hornets said Bower was leaving after spending more than 14 seasons with the club. He was the GM since 2005.\n\nHornets president Hugh Weber says it was in the best interest of the club to part ways with Bower."
