        "text": "The NBA G League is coming to Birmingham, and the New Orleans Pelicans are seeking suggestions before they name their affiliate team in Alabama.\n\nThe NBA team is asking area basketball fans to submit online their ideas for the team’s name. The suggestion box opened on Wednesday, and the Pelicans will continue taking ideas until 5 p.m. CST Dec. 23.\n\n“This is a great way for the community to share the names that they think would represent the city of Birmingham and this exciting new team,” Pelicans President Dennis Lauscha said in a release from the team. “From the beginning, we’ve said that we want the city of Birmingham to be involved in this process. This allows them the opportunity to support the team, and we are eagerly waiting to see the submissions.”\n\nNew Orleans fielded its first NBA G League franchise in the 2019-20 season, resurrecting the Erie BayHawks. The Pennsylvania team had had two previous incarnations in the G League, with those teams moving to become the Lakeland Magic after the 2016-17 season and the College Park Skyhawks after the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe Pelicans hope to relocate the BayHawks to Birmingham for the 2021-22 season. The team will play its home games at Legacy Arena at the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex, which will have a larger capacity than any facility currently used in the G League.\n\nNew Orleans hopes to announce the team’s Birmingham name early next year.\n\nThe Pelicans’ plans for Birmingham mark the return of the NBA’s minor league to Alabama. The inaugural season of the league, when it was known as the National Basketball Development League, included two Alabama teams – the Huntsville Flight and the Mobile Revelers.\n\nThe Revelers lasted for two seasons before folding, but Mobile won the league’s championship in its final campaign.\n\nThe Flight spent four seasons in Huntsville and lives on as the Canton Charge, the G League affiliate of the Cleveland Cavaliers, with a six-year stop as the Albuquerque Thunderbirds in between."
