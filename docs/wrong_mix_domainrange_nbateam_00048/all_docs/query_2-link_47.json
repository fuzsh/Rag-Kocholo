        "text": "Each weekday morning, BDL serves up a handful of NBA-related stories to digest with your ciabatta.\n\nMark Stein, ESPN: \"The Utah Jazz have quickly moved into the lead to acquire Al Jefferson(notes) and were actively working Monday night to complete a deal with Minnesota, according to NBA front-office sources. Sources told ESPN.com that the Jazz and Timberwolves are on the verge of completing a trade that would slot Jefferson's contract into the $14 million trade exception that Utah created earlier this week in its sign-and-trade deal with Chicago for Carlos Boozer(notes). The full extent of the package that Minnesota would receive in return was not immediately known, as one source told ESPN.com that the two teams were still discussing the terms of draft picks that Utah would send to seal the deal. But because its trade exception is large enough to absorb Jefferson's $13 million salary next season, Utah can complete a trade for Jefferson without sending back any players to the Wolves. Sources with knowledge of Minnesota's thinking said Monday that the Wolves' main aim in shopping Jefferson in recent weeks has been securing multiple future first-round picks and taking back as little salary if possible. Via his Twitter account Monday night, Utah CEO Greg Miller wrote: 'I just approved a Jazz roster move that I'm very excited about. Planning to share details tomorrow.'\"\n\nJohn Reid, New Orleans Times Picayune: \"New Orleans Hornets point guard Darren Collison's(notes) participation at the Las Vegas Summer League was shorten after getting permission by Coach Monty Williams to leave Monday morning so he can enroll in summer school at UCLA. Collison sat out Sunday night's game against the Miami Heat because of a bruised right knee. In his only summer league game last Friday against Golden State, Collison had nine points and seven assists. But in the fourth quarter, Collison bumped into Warriors forward Brandan Wright(notes) on a pick-and-roll play and injured his right knee. With Collison acknowledging that he remains on the trading block, the Hornets wanted to avoid diminishing his potential trade value by playing him in front of NBA general managers while injured. 'The trade talks definitely motivates and fuels me,' Collison said. 'No matter where I got to play, I'm going to help that team out.' However, Hornets Coach Monty Williams said Collison benefited from participating, even though he played in just one of the Hornets' five games.\"\n\nDave D'Alessandro, New Jersey Star-Ledger: \"The Nets made another signing yesterday, acquiring restricted free agent Anthony Morrow(notes) in a sign-and-trade transaction from Golden State, which receives nothing in return but a trade exception. Morrow will get a three-year, $12 million contract, so his first-year salary ($3 million) reduces the Nets' bankroll to $14.9 million, with 12 players now under contract. The two-year pro, a 6-foot-5 wing, averaged 13.0 points per game last season in Don Nelson's freelance offense and finished fifth in the NBA in 3-point shooting (.456).\"\n\nFrank Isola, New York Daily News: \"Make no mistake, Walsh and Mike D'Antoni can't be thrilled that Thomas is playing de-facto general manager from Florida International University. A Knicks official admitted that Thomas is 'working like crazy' to rejoin the club and now he has the perfect ammunition. His conversation with Dolan will go something like this: 'Jim, Donnie did a great job getting under the cap but he couldn't close the deal. And forget about all these Olympic stars wanting to play for D'Antoni. He couldn't get LeBron or Wade. I know these guys. I have a relationship with them. Do you know which point guard Chris Paul(notes) has been compared to? That's right, me. Carmelo loves me, too. I will not lose these two guys next summer the way Donnie and Mike lost LeBron.' Come to think of it, he's probably made this clear to Dolan already.\"\n\nRusty Simmons, San Francisco Chronicle: \"As expected, the Warriors announced Monday that Ekpe Udoh(notes), the sixth pick in last month's draft, is scheduled to undergo left wrist surgery Wednesday. But that doesn't close the book on this case. It has been confirmed that the injury is a torn ligament and that Udoh will probably miss four to six months. However, there is some mystery surrounding the rookie's injury. A Warriors news release said the 6-foot-10 power forward from Baylor was injured in a supervised workout at the team's Oakland facility July 4. Udoh said it happened that day while attempting a dunk; point guard Stephen Curry(notes) said it happened while catching a routine pass from director of athletic development Mark Grabow; and shooting guard Reggie Williams(notes) noticed Udoh's wrist was hurting days earlier, while Udoh was bench pressing. 'It was really a freak thing,' Curry said. 'I guess he caught a pass the wrong way, and something kind of snapped, jammed, popped or whatever. I've never seen anyone get hurt that way.' One Warriors decision-maker said he believes Udoh was hurt while working with a personal trainer in Atlanta during the week between the draft and when he returned to Oakland. 'We're sure it happened earlier, and Ekpe certainly should have told us, but that doesn't change our minds about him,' he said. After Monta Ellis(notes) initially lied about injuring his ankle on a moped in 2008, the Warriors suspended him 30 games - costing the guard about $3 million. If the Warriors are convinced that Udoh was dishonest about the origin of his injury, they could be in a quagmire: wanting to reward Udoh for his hunger to work through pain but needing to hold him accountable. 'I would have to look at anything that came up with regard to that,' general manager Larry Riley said. 'My main concern is figuring out what the best thing is to do for him to get healthy.'\"\n\nBroderick Turner and Mike Bresnahan, Los Angeles Times: \"Lakers assistant general manager Ronnie Lester met with the Phoenix Suns about their vacancy for general manager. He will meet with Suns owner Robert Sarver later this week.\"\n\nRamona Shelburne, ESPN: \"Derek Fisher has decided to stay with the Los Angeles Lakers. Credit Kobe Bryant(notes) with the assist. 'I have decided to continue with Kobe, continue with our teammates and the fans of Los Angeles,' Fisher said in a statement on his website. 'While this may not be the most lucrative contract I've been offered this offseason, it is the most valuable. I am confident I will continue to lead this team on and off the court. Let the hunt for six begin.' NBA sources said Fisher's contract is for three years for $10.5 million with a player option for a third year. The Lakers have won two straight titles and five in Fisher's tenure with the team. He gets a three-year deal to return, with a player option on the final year. The Lakers improved their offer a number of times during negotiations, with Fisher deciding to stay around noon PT on Monday, a source said. The Lakers were waiting for the deal to be completed before announcing anything. 'Nothing is signed yet,' Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said. 'We're in continuous dialogue with [Fisher's] representative and we hope to announce something soon.'\"\n\nMichael Wallace, Miami Herald: \"In the end, forward Udonis Haslem(notes) chose the chance to be part of a dynasty over the opportunity to make more dollars. Haslem said Monday he turned down more lucrative offers to sign a five-year contract with the Heat. The deal is worth in excess of $20 million. 'It was an opportunity to win, an opportunity to be close to my mother, with her illness, and an opportunity to be a part of something special,' he said. 'I've never been in this for the money. I would be changing my DNA if I changed just for money.' Meanwhile, the Heat also reached an agreement, as expected, with swingman Mike Miller(notes) on a five-year deal. His agent, Arn Tellum, who has been writing about free agency for The Huffington Post, said Miller chose the Heat over the Knicks, Cavaliers, Clippers and Bulls. Miller met with Heat officials in Los Angeles shortly after free agency started July 1. 'In the elevator [that night], Mike told me that if [Pat Riley] could pull of a LeBron James(notes)-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh(notes) trifecta, he'd be South Florida bound.'\"\n\nMark Murphy, Boston Herald: \"Though the Celtics failed to reach a resolution with Tony Allen(notes), and paid the price Sunday night when the guard and the Memphis Grizzlies agreed on a three-year contract, talks with the team's other remaining free agent continue to progress. Aaron Goodwin, the agent for Nate Robinson(notes), said yesterday the two sides could reach a deal by the end of the week. 'Things are going well,' Goodwin said. 'We're just trying to get something worked out. But both parties are talking.' According to a league source, the Celtics offered Allen an amount similar to the $3 million he will receive annually from Memphis but were unwilling to guarantee the third year as the Grizzlies did. Unlike they had with Allen, the C's don't hold the so-called 'Larry Bird rights' to Robinson, and as a result, can't go over the salary cap to give their backup point guard more money. Robinson, however, has professed a desire to return.\""
