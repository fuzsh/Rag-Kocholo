        "text": "CHARLOTTE – It was supposed to be an easy night for the Charlotte Hornets against the injury-ravaged New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nInstead, the Hornets and Kemba Walker needed to make big plays down the stretch of a 122-113 shootout victory Wednesday night in front of 16,335 at Time Warner Cable Arena.\n\nFacing a Pelicans team that was starting a NBDL All-Star that had been signed only the night before, Charlotte roared ahead by 13 in the first quarter and 17 in the second quarter.\n\nBut New Orleans’ high-scoring duo of Anthony Davis (40 points) and Jrue Holiday (38) led a comeback that caught the Hornets at 109 with 3:19 to play.\n\nBut Walker continued his recent hot streak with a fourth straight game of 30 or more points by scoring 11 of his 35 in the final 2:51 for Charlotte’s fifth straight win and 11th victory in 13 games.\n\n“We’re healthy, we want to win, we’re motivated and we want the playoffs,” Walker said. “You can’t say much more.”\n\nCharlotte (35-28) remained in sixth place of the Eastern Conference, but the Hornets' hot streak has them only three games out of third place and three games ahead of ninth-place Detroit (32-31), whom Charlotte hosts Friday night at 7.\n\n“They’re playing great basketball,” New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry, a Shelby native, said of the Hornets. Charlotte coach “Steve's (Clifford) done a great job of changing the way they play. They changed the way they usually play by spreading the floor and going small when Al's (Jefferson) not in there.”\n\nOn this night, even as Walker had 35, the Hornets got balanced scoring with seven double-figure scorers.\n\n“When we’re at our best, we’re going to defend, rebound, not turn the ball over and share the ball,” Clifford said. “That ball in the first half, that ball was moving and that is how we have to play.”\n\nCourtney Lee added 16 points, Nicolas Batum 15, Marvin Williams 14, Cody Zeller 13, Jeremy Lin 12 and Frank Kaminsky 10 for Charlotte.\n\nBut the Hornets did struggle defending the Pelicans (24-39), who scored 30 or more points in two quarters on Wednesday night.\n\nDavis and Holiday led the fourth-quarter charge from a 103-92 deficit with 10:48 remaining to knot the score at 109 before Walker took charge in the closing minutes.\n\n“When you start the game like we did and dig yourself a hole, then you spend the whole game trying to get yourself back,” Gentry said. “I was happy with the way we played. We made a run to get back in it, but all we did was get ourselves even because we were so far back.”\n\nHornets Notes\n\nHow tough has it been for Gentry in his first year as New Orleans head coach? New Orleans had its 30th starting lineup in 63 games this season.\n\n“We’re going to come close to 300 injury games (missed),” said Gentry, a 1973 Shelby High graduate. “We just had to continue to plug away. It’s been a frustrating year for everyone – from ownership to management to the coaches to the players.”….\n\nGentry left 24 tickets for his family and friends from Shelby on Wednesday, among them his sister Lois Hoskins….\n\nCharlotte hit 15 3-pointers in Wednesday’s game, the 12th time this season the Hornets have hit 14 or more 3-pointers in a single game. Before this season, the Hornets/Bobcats/Hornets franchise had hit 14 or more 3-pointers in eight games covering 25 seasons….\n\nThe seven-game homestand resumes Friday against Detroit at 7 p.m. The Hornets then host Houston on Saturday, Dallas (and Gastonia’s Darrell Armstrong, a Mavericks’ longtime player and assistant coach) on Monday and Orlando next Wednesday.\n\nRichard Walker: 704-869-1841; twitter.com/jrwalk22"
