        "text": "The Charlotte Bobcats are eliminated from further play after losing 109-98 in Game 4 of the 1st round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. The Miami Heat leave Charlotte, North Carolina having swept the Bobcats with style. Many of the players on the Bobcats squad will remain with the organization the next time that the Heat return to Time Warner Cable Arena. However, one key item will change outside and within the facility. The Bobcats will be re-branded as the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nIn December 2013, the Charlotte Bobcats unveiled new primary and secondary logos that will be attached to a new Hornets brand. It includes a meaner, tougher hornet that signifies a return to tradition, but also separates the new club from its past.\n\n\"We recognize the heritage behind the original logo and our goal was to connect to the past but also include elements of an evolution,\" Bobcats Sports & Entertainment President & COO Fred Whitfield said in December. He also mentioned that the city would be getting back its original mascot. \"[W]e are thrilled to be able to bring Hugo back as our mascot. We realize all he meant to the city and our fans and weâ€™re excited to re-introduce him this offseason.\"\n\nThe team now known as the Pelicans and playing home games in New Orleans was once based in Charlotte and referred to as the Hornets. The Hornets initially became a part of the NBA as part of the 1988 Expansion Draft, the same Draft that included the creation of the Miami Heat. In 2002, the then-Charlotte Hornets relocated to New Orleans and changed its name to the Pelicans. Charlotte was left without an NBA team for only 2 years. In 2004, the Charlotte Bobcats were founded. After 10 years, of playing basketball as the Bobcats, the club in Charlotte will return to its roots, shed the Bobcats nickname and once again become the Hornets.\n\nThe newly branded Hornets have a lot to look forward to next season. A 43-39 regular season record in 2013-14 counts as the second-most number of wins for the franchise since its formation. It was also more than double the wins the club amassed in 2012-13 (21 wins). Further, the team has a solid core with Kemba Walker at the point guard position and Al Jefferson at center, with a young and maturing Michael Kidd-Gilchrist at small forward.\n\nBobcats players still under contract will remain with the new-look Hornets. However, the arena and player uniforms will look entirely different at the start of the 2014-15 NBA season. With a sweep by the Heat, it is bye bye to the Bobcats and hello to the Hornets.\n\nWant to learn more about the business of sports? Order my book How to Play the Game and follow me on Twitter."
