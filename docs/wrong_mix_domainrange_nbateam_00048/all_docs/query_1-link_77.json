        "text": "Bringing their old nickname and some new firepower, the Charlotte Hornets make their first appearance in Greenville tonight hoping to create the kind of buzz that helped it rank among NBA leaders in attendance during their early years.\n\nCharlotte will play the Washington Wizards in an exhibition game at 7 p.m. at Bon Secours Wellness Arena. Doors open at 6 p.m. Ticket prices range from $17 to $152.\n\nThe Charlotte franchise was known as the Hornets from 1988 to 2002, when owner George Shinn moved the team to New Orleans and took the nickname with him. The NBA granted Charlotte a new franchise, known for 10 seasons as the Bobcats, but when New Orleans decided to switch its nickname to the Pelicans, Charlotte petitioned the NBA to become the Hornets again. The switch became official in May.\n\nThe team that tips off tonight also will be bringing momentum from a promising 2013-14 season. One season after going 21-61, Charlotte went 43-39 and reached the NBA playoffs, where it was eliminated in the first round by the Miami Heat.\n\nAl Jefferson, signed as a free agent before the 2013-14 season, emerged as a star, averaging more than 21 points and 10 rebounds per game. He was complemented nicely by guard Kemba Walker, who averaged 17.7 points and 6.1 assists per game.\n\nThey have been joined this season by former Indiana Pacers guard Lance Stephenson, who led the NBA with five triple-doubles in 2013-14, and two former University of North Carolina standouts, veteran forward Marvin Williams and rookie guard P.J. Hairston.\n\nWashington finished one game ahead of Charlotte in the NBA's Southeast Division in 2013-14. The Wizards' top players are guards John Wall (19.3 points, 8.8 assists per game in 2013-14) and Bradley Beal (17.1 ppg) and center Marcin Gortat (13.2 ppg, 9.5 rebounds per game)\n\nBon Secours Wellness Arena also will have a new look tonight. The facility has completed renovations to the floors, roof, floors, restrooms and concourse and brought new items to concessions menu."
