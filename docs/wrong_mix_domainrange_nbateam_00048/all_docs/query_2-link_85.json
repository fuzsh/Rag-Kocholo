        "text": "The Charlotte Hornets All-Decade team is complied of the top players in franchise history. The Hornets have been relatively one of the bottom-tier teams in the NBA for the last 10 seasons. But, Charlotte has produced great talent that has come and gone over the years. Despite only two playoff appearances, the Hornets are rebuilding for future success.\n\nSince changing their name from the Charlotte Bobcats to the Hornets in the 2014-15 season, Charlotte has only made the postseason once. A first-round exit to the Miami Heat in 2015-16. The franchise’s best player of the decade, Kemba Walker, dedicated years of tremendous effort to the organization. He will likely go down as one of the top players in franchise history.\n\nCharlotte Hornets All-Decade Team for the 2010s\n\nDecade in Review\n\nThrough the last 10 years, the Hornets are 192-218. The rebuild has been ongoing for years, and some of the best talent on the team never had the chance to compete for an NBA championship. However, many of the players on this list contributed great values to the team that will stick forever in franchise history.\n\nThe future is bright for the Charlotte Hornets as their rebuild continues. Here is the list of the All-Decade team for the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nStarters\n\nPlayer of the Decade: Kemba Walker\n\nWalker played with the Hornets from 2011-2018. In his tenure, the former first-round draft pick scored 12,009 points, which is the franchise record. A four-time NBA All-Star selection, Walker gave it his all on the court for the Hornets. He ranks second in franchise history in assists with 3,308 and first in most minutes played with 20,607.\n\nWalker led the Hornets to a 108-106 comeback win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on October 29, 2014, as the Hornets rebranded and became the Charlotte Hornets yet again. On November 17, 2018, Walker scored a career-high and franchise-high 60 points against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nWalker’s legacy will live on forever in Charlotte, despite the move to join the Boston Celtics last off-season. What he accomplished with the Hornets is unprecedented for the franchise. Though he never led the team to a title, Walker made a lasting impression.\n\nGuard: Stephen Jackson\n\nStephen Jackson made a big impact during his two seasons in Charlotte. He guided the team to their first playoff appearance in 2009-10. Though he left in 2011, Jackson played a key role in Charlotte’s journey to a playoff berth that the organization and fans will forever remember.\n\nForward: Gerald Wallace\n\nGerald Wallace could make a case against Walker to be named the greatest player in Charlotte basketball franchise history. His career in the Queen City lasted from 2004-2011, and he became the first player in the organization to be named an All-Star.\n\nWallace ranks third in franchise history in points with 7,437 and third in rebounds with 3,398. He was named to the NBA All-Defensive team in 2010 and an All-Star selection the same season.\n\nForward: Marvin Williams\n\nMarvin Williams was signed as a free agent in 2014 and has been a valuable asset ever since. One key position lack on the court has been power forward. But Williams has given the Hornets stability at the position. Through his tenure, he has been one of the most consistent players on the team.\n\nThough he was waived on February 8, Williams scored a season-high 30 points on March 8, 2018, with seven three-point shots made. He was claimed by the Milwaukee Bucks shortly after being waived by the Hornets. Although he is no longer with the team, Williams provided security at a position of need during his time in Charlotte.\n\nCenter: Al Jefferson\n\nAl Jefferson could go down as the best free-agent signing ever made by the Charlotte Hornets. His tenure with the team spanned from 2013 to 2016. In that time, he helped lead the team to two playoff appearances in three seasons.\n\nHis arrival to the team was delayed by a high ankle sprain that forced the All-Star center to miss playing time. The All-Star center was suspended in 2015 for violating the league drug policy. But, he brought a new wave of confidence to the franchise with his level of play. In 2014, he tied his career-high with 40 points.\n\nBench\n\nGuard: D.J. Augustin\n\nD.J. Augustin played for Charlotte from 2008-12 and is the only other valuable point selection besides Kemba Walker. Drafted ninth overall in 2008 by Charlotte, Augustin was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second team in 2009. He became a free agent after the 2012 season.\n\nBefore his career in Charlotte ended, Augustin scored a total of 4.3 points per game during the team’s first-ever playoff appearance in 2010.\n\nGuard: Gerald Henderson\n\nGerald Henderson had longevity with the team, playing from 2009-2015. He played a key part in the team’s 2013 playoff appearance. During his tenure, Henderson impacted the team in many positive ways.\n\nDrafted ninth overall by Charlotte in 2009, Henderson had a breakout season in 2011-12. In a below-average season in which the team finished with the worst record, he went 45.9 percent from the floor that season. He became the main offensive weapon for the team that season.\n\nHis player option was exercised in 2015 and he officially left Charlotte, but his impact on the team’s future success following his tenure will last for years to come.\n\nForward: Nicolas Batum\n\nMany Charlotte fans may still be irate with the organization for giving Nicolas Batum a heft contract in 2016. But the season before that, he played a crucial role in getting the franchise to the playoffs. When he arrived in Charlotte, Batum provided a variety of skill sets that were indicative of the offensive scheme at the time. His play has declined, but the run to the playoffs will never be forgotten.\n\nSince coming to the Hornets in 2015, Batum has been a valuable asset to the franchise. Despite a decline in his level of play, his highest field goal percentage came in 2018-19 at .450. He averaged 15.1 points per game in 2015-16, the highest of his career.\n\nForward: Boris Diaw\n\nBoris Diaw forced his way out of Charlotte in 2012. However, Diaw was another key player in the team’s playoff run in 2010. The Hornets have lacked at multiple positions throughout the decade. Power forward is one of them, but Diaw played well during his tenure.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, he appeared in all 82 games for the franchise. He averaged 11.3 points per game during both of those seasons. During the 2010 playoff run, Diaw averaged 7.5 points per game with a .500 shooting percentage from the floor.\n\nCenter: Cody Zeller\n\nCody Zeller was selected by the Hornets in the 2013 NBA Draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second team in 2014. Averaging 8.2 points per game, Zeller has been a role player off the bench for Charlotte in recent years.\n\nIn 2016-17, he shot his highest percentage from the floor at .571. During the 2016 playoffs, Zeller averaged 8.4 points per game for Charlotte. He has a relatively high basketball IQ and plays with an unselfish style on the court.\n\nLast Word on the Charlotte Hornets\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets All-Decade Team has a lot of talent stacked into these players. For a team searching to find their true identity, the Hornets have produced great talent over the years. The pieces are beginning to come together in the Queen City for this team to become a contender. What does the next decade hold for the Charlotte Hornets?"
