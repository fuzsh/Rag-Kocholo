        "text": "For just one night, local basketball fans got the NBA experience close to home.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets and the Washington Wizards brought NBA action and entertainment to the Bon Secours Wellness Arena for a preseason game.\n\nThe Hornets beat the Wizards 99-86 in front of 8,589 fans.\n\nThe game two hours southwest of Charlotte represented an opportunity for the Hornets to spread their brand and engage a wider fan base. That brand happens to be a case of what's old is new again.\n\nThis season marks the return of the Hornets nickname to Charlotte. When the original Charlotte NBA franchise moved to New Orleans, the Hornets name went as well. That team opted to change to the Pelicans, opening the door for Charlotte to regain the Hornets name.\n\nJudging by the Hornets gear in the crowd and the line at team store, the nickname change has been well received in the Upstate.\n\nHornets head coach Steve Clifford is a fan of NBA teams playing exhibitions outside of their home cities.\n\n\"I think it's great,\" he said. \"When I was with the Lakers, we played three different places, all within an hour-and-a-half, two hours. I think it's great to hopefully build a fan base in other areas.\n\n\"And the guys like it. They get to go some place different. They play in a different arena. So I think it's really healthy.\"\n\nFans appreciated the chance to see several well-known and rising basketball stars.\n\nLen Starks of Duncan said the event was great and \"hopefully we can attract more NBA-type games to this area. The Upstate is certainly a growing area. I think we're deserving of this kind of showcase.\"\n\n\"It's fantastic,\" said Jon-Mikel Byrne of Greenville, a NBA and Kentucky fan that took the opportunity to see former Wildcats Michael Kidd-Gilchrist of Charlotte and John Wall of Washington. \"Hopefully, this gets the fan base to broaden out to Greenville. The more we're involved the more likely they are to come back.\"\n\nThe last NBA exhibition game played in the arena in downtown Greenville was Oct. 23, 2001 when the Wizards beat the New Jersey Nets 105-92. Those Wizards featured Michael Jordan, who was making his last comeback as a player. He is now majority owner and chairman of the Hornets.\n\nCharlotte is coming off of a turnaround season. In the final season as the Bobcats, the team went 43-39 and reached the NBA playoffs. They lost in the first round to the Miami Heat in four games.\n\nGary Neal of the Hornets led all scorers with 19 points. Xavier Silas led Washington with 16. Charlotte's Al Jefferson and the Wizards DeJuan Blair led in rebounding with 10 each."
