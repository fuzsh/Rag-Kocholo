        "text": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph J. Ellis, a historian who was educated at the College of William and Mary and Yale, is a Ford Foundation Professor of History at Mount Holyoke University. He has written four books on historical topics, centered on the time Jefferson was alive, dealing with issues and personalities Jefferson dealt with firsthand. After authoring a book on a politician such as John Adams, Ellis seems to have felt a need or want to focus on Jefferson, presumably because of his status as founding father and main contributor to the constitution.\n\nCarroll immediately becomes the Raptors' best perimeter defender, which isn't saying much considering who he finds himself surrounded with. As Eric Koreen of the National Post acknowledges, having the former Atlanta Hawk in the lineup will allow DeMar DeRozan to defend smaller wings, leaving tougher assignments for the more adept Carroll to tangle with on a nightly basis.\n\nThere is one last major way that Jefferson violates his Constitutional Principals, and that is by going against his principal of low government spending. Jefferson, in the Jeffersonian Cyclopedia, wrote, “I am for a government rigorously frugal and simple, applying all the possible savings of the public revenue to the discharge of the national debt.” Jefferson believed in spending as little money as possible to keep the national debt low. For the most part he keeps true to this, but the Louisiana Purchase shows once again how he goes against his principals. In transcription of the Louisiana Purchase it says, “The Government\n\nJefferson uses many techniques to portray exemplification. One of those techniques is work choice and lettering. “He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.” In this quote, he uses words such as Will and Judges. These words are emphasized by capitalization and the use of them in the sentence, not the just at the start of sentences. One other technique he uses is angeling the problem to one person. This allows his argument to be compelling and he doesn't blame a group but one\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans, which is owned by Tom Benson, was established on January 24, 2013. The Pelicans is an American professional basketball team located in New Orleans, Louisiana, and they compete in the National Basketball Association, a part of the league's Western Conference Southwest Division. Basketball is a sport, generally played by two teams consisting of five players. Their objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop, to obtain points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. The Pelicans consist of five separate positions described as: point guard (Jrue Randall Holiday), shooting guard (Chavano Rainier \"Buddy\" Hield), small forward (Tyreke Jamir Evans), power forward (Anthony Marshon Davis, Jr),\n\nWhen Jefferson first goes into jail, he makes an assumption that he is an animal and not a person. Because he believes that he is just an animal, he thinks that he should only eat corn instead of chicken. An example of this is “‘That’s what hogs eat’ he said” (p. 82). This quote shows that Jefferson sees himself as equivalent to a hog and only worthy to eat the same food as hogs. However, towards the end of the novel Jefferson learns how to become a man and to stay strong and have self respect. When Jefferson is executed, he remains stoic and calm. After Jefferson died, Paul told Grant, “He was the strongest man in that crowded room, Grant Wiggins” (p. 253). This shows that he has become a man by staying strong, even when he would not be expected to. By learning to respect himself, Jefferson is able to cope with his impending\n\nAs time was running out for Jefferson, he changed completely. An example of this change comes from page 231 when Jefferson is writing about seeing his godmother for the last time. He says “ When they brought me in the room and I see nanan at the table, I see how old she looked and how tired she looked. And I told her I love her and I told her I was strong…\n\nJeffersonians were, according to McDonald, Americans of Celtic descent, Protestants, or slaveholders from the south. In his own time, Jefferson was regarded by his peers as a champion of liberty, although he never thought it through as a concept. To him, it 's meaning was a conventional one, and since he was a slaveholder, Jefferson never could truly understand liberty. Even his father gained their estate by slaughtering or conning the natives,\n\nA post-up behemoth like Jefferson, however, is more of a black hole when gets the ball on the block, stalling an offensive as he pounds the ball towards the rim with brute force. Okafor's post-game doesn't need to be so lifeless, as his one-handed passing with his giant meat cleaver hands should allow him to quickly pass out of double teams and find open shooters without sacrificing too much in terms of tempo, as he does below:"
