        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The Hornets’ offense has come unmoored. The unit that stunned opponents and fans alike with top-five efficiency earlier this season has devolved into unset 3-pointers and sloppy penetration. Charlotte is 3-8 in its past 11 games, a stretch that included seven home games.\n\nThat the Hornets have not fallen completely on their face is a credit to a defensive system honed by their Van Gundy disciple coach, Steve Clifford. But the issues on the other end are multi-faceted. Several players have fallen back to earth after hot starts, while injuries have sidelined and hobbled others, shifting the rotation in the process. Then there’s the hole in the middle, the size of Charlotte’s biggest player in size and presence.\n\nMORE: 10 bold predictions for the NBA in 2016 | 6 players being used wrong\n\nOn paper, Al Jefferson was struggling when he went down in late November. He was posting his lowest scoring and rebounding averages since he became a starter in 2006, and the Hornets were playing better with him on the bench, on both ends of the floor. But after coming into camp 20 pounds and a stack of Popeye’s receipts lighter than last season, Jefferson had changed his game along with the team. He refused to let the space-and-pace era or lower body injuries run him out of the game, and that assertiveness showed on and off the court. Jefferson still was a deadly low-post scorer, but he showed a renewed passion for pick-and-rolls and stepping out on shooters and finding open teammates.\n\nThe NBA is a battle of gravity. The basket forms a black hole, pulling offenses toward it but allowing defenses to pack themselves in with greater density as a result. The Hornets spent their offseason digging for players who could resist that temptation and be effective around the perimeter. “We want to play four-out,” Clifford repeated any time anyone asked about the roster changes. All seven new players on the roster would take their place in this new offensive philosophy.\n\nJefferson was the counterweight. He filled the lane and drew double-teams, freeing up shooters. He forced defenses to stay accountable and could, when healthy, punish them. Clifford would run plays for Jefferson to start each half, sucking opponents toward the basket to free up Kemba Walker, Jeremy Lin, Batum and the other perimeter playmakers later in games.\n\nThen Jefferson strained his calf on Nov. 29. Then he was suspended five games for violating the NBA’s anti-drug policy, effective upon his return to healthy. He managed two games after Christmas but looked poor, finishing 2-for-12 from the field with eight rebounds in 32 minutes combined. On Dec. 30, the Hornets announced he’d miss six weeks for right knee surgery. That means the All-Star break.\n\nThe Hornets played well in Jefferson’s immediate absence. They ran over the Pistons, Heat and Grizzlies in blowouts, with Cody Zeller looking like the starting center of the present rather than future. They don’t need \"Big Al,\" the thinking went, because he doesn’t fit the mentality of the team now. Then the losing started, the 3-8 skid that began with a Dec. 12 loss to the Celtics.\n\nMORE: Behind Kemba Walker's buzzsaw path to All-Star efficiency\n\nAll of this comes with Jefferson hitting free agency this summer. He’s making $13.8 million this year but unlikely to command that salary because of health alone. The Hornets also will have to deal with Batum, Lin (via player option) and Marvin Williams on the market. The salary cap is rising to a reported $89 million, and Charlotte will have flexibility to chase a second-tier free agent while keeping all three of those rotation players.\n\nThey would have to renounce Jefferson's rights in the process, though. Here’s the impasse: Zeller and rookie Frank Kaminsky, who has played well in the past month, are the big men of the future for the Hornets. They play well together, giving the team a rare set of 7-footers with enough athleticism to guard smaller lineups. Zeller stresses that he has worked to be versatile enough to play with any of the Hornets' variety pack of big men, but he shows undeniable chemistry with Kaminsky, drafted ninth overall last June. Yet neither can do what Jefferson does. Neither provides that gravity.\n\nJefferson will have to take a pay cut whether he stays or goes. He certainly enjoys Charlotte, a town much closer to his Southern roots than his previous stops in Boston, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City. And Clifford values the big man and his style of basketball. He knows the value of that reliable force down low on a team that leans so heavily on 3-pointers.\n\nThat does not erase Jefferson’s flaws. Zeller is a better pick-and-roll player on both ends, using his near-unprecedented speed as a 7-footer to challenge drivers despite his weak shot-blocking skills. He is 8 years younger, and he lacks the injury history of Jefferson. Factor in the minor bump of that third marijuana violation — the only infraction that would draw a five-game suspension — and the future is clouded for Jefferson. He could beat up on opposing second units for the Hornets, sure, but he may want to start. He also may find a suitor offering more money; nearly every team will have at least $13 million in cap room this offseason, and center still is a premium position.\n\nIf Zeller and company can’t reverse this skid, Jefferson's return may come too late. A trade would make sense at that point, along with a shift in mentality. This team already is without Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, its best defender and highest-potential young player, for the season because of a preseason shoulder injury. Many gave up on the 2016 playoffs then, but the strides from Walker and Batum provided hope. Jefferson’s situation complicates that now and in the future.\n\nMORE: The Hornets' oversized path to playing small-ball\n\nThe Hornets are not thinking about the offseason. After last season’s catastrophe, a playoff berth would mean too much for this franchise that rebranded itself in 2014 and hosts the NBA All-Star Game in 2017. Charlotte has not seen a playoff victory — game or series — since 2002, from a team that promptly moved to New Orleans the following season.\n\nThe franchise, under the stable-but-criticized guidance of owner Michael Jordan, has grounded itself in recent years. This season was all about the Hornets finding space. Perhaps Jefferson can pull them back into orbit."
