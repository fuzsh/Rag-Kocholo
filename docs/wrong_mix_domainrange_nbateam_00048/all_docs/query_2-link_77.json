        "text": "It began with a bang. It ends with a whimper. The Anthony Davis Era did not officially start on May 31, 2012 but it might as well have. This was the night of the 2012 NBA Draft Lottery, when the basketball gods looked down from on high and gave the then-New Orleans Hornets a blessing […]\n\nAfter sitting out Wednesday night’s blowout win against an exhausted Portland Trailblazers team, the rumors began to circulate that Eric Gordon would be moved between then and the Thursday, February 21st trade deadline. Whether or not the rumors are true are, in a sense, immaterial. The simple fact is that Gordon hasn’t been healthy for […]\n\nAt approximately 3:00 PM CST today, the team that was born the Charlotte Hornets in 1988 officially became the New Orleans Pelicans. When he purchased the team back in April, owner Tom Benson had made his intentions clear to change the Hornets moniker to one he felt more appropriately tied into the region’s history and […]\n\nBefore I begin, let me wish nothing but luck to the thousands of people affected by Hurricane Sandy’s arrival to the Eastern seaboard. Having just lived through a hurricane weeks back, I can sympathize with all that they’re going through. Hopefully people heeded the authorities’ warnings and either evacuated or prepared to stay put through […]\n\nWithin the last 48 hours, I’ve had two of the biggest names for two of my favorite teams come out and demand a move to a new team. First, Eric Gordon, the Hornets’ All-Star shooting guard, found a team willing to pay him the maximum amount of money he can get – in this case, […]\n\nSo the 2012 NBA Draft ended a few hours ago and most of the analysis has begun. The fact is that it’s impossible to know right now who made the right choice and who let the surefire All-Star pass. Those are conclusions that won’t be reached until years from now. Even the selection of consensus […]\n\nIt’s been a long time a-comin’ but Lady Luck finally smiled towards the poor, downtrodden New Orleans Hornets. After spending a year trying to (and failing) to lose enough to get the most ping-pong balls in the NBA Draft Lottery hopper, they still managed to come away with the biggest prize: the #1 overall pick […]\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that. The deal that apparently couldn’t be closed was finalized and the superstar who kept being told he was going nowhere is gone. By now, everyone knows that Chris Paul is officially a Los Angeles Clipper, where he will throw lobs to Blake Griffin that will be available on […]\n\nWith only a few hours since the ratification of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, Twitter exploded with rumors that Hornets PG Chris Paul was on the verge of being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers – at first glance for PF Pau Gasol and C Andrew Bynum, then it was corrected to be Pau Gasol […]\n\nIf you’ve kept up with the NBA’s labor duel, it might seem as if things are extremely dire. Both sides are committed to their hard position and it seems as if both would rather drive off a cliff with the other side than compromise. Just this past weekend, news of a contentious meeting surfaced with […]"
