No.\n\nPlayed inconsistently, made-you-scratch-your-head and lost to a vastly inferior and undermanned team?\n\nYep.\n\nA night after looking like a sure-bet playoff team in a 10-point win at Memphis, the Jazz looked as awkward and out of sorts as a couple of missionaries on Bourbon Street.\n\nAnd, yes, they did that against a four-win team.\n\nScratch that. The New Orleans Hornets improved to a lofty 5-23 with an 86-80 win over the terrific-one-night-terrible-the-next Jazz.\n\nBecause of injuries, the Hornets were without key players like Eric Gordon and Emeka Okafor.\n\nBut they had Chris Kaman, who scored 27 points. They also had somebody named Gustavo Ayon and Marco Belinelli, who each contributed 13 points as New Orleans snapped an eight-game losing streak.\n\nThe Junior Jazz and Gordon Hayward made it interesting in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter falling behind by as many as 20 points with a completely inept night by most of the main Jazz players, the mix-and-match crew rallied to within three points with 21.6 seconds remaining.\n\nBut Kaman hit a pair of key free throws to help New Orleans pick up a win after losing 23 of its previous 25 games.\n\nAl Jefferson led Utah with 14 points and 12 rebounds, but the Jazz only had 36 points at halftime and 51 through three quarters before posting a failed comeback.\n\nIt gets a whole lot more difficult Wednesday, when the Jazz wrap up their back-to-back-to-back against one of the NBA's best in Oklahoma City.\n\nEMAIL: jody@desnews.com\n\nTWITTER: DJJazzyJody\n\nHalf time Quick Take\n\nNEW ORLEANS — The Utah Jazz are at it again.\n\nWinning? No.\n\nPlaying inconsistently, make-you-scratch-your-head, trailing to a vastly inferior and undermanned team?\n\nYep.\n\nA night after looking like a sure-bet playoff team in a 10-point win at Memphis, the Jazz are looking as awkward and out of sorts as a couple of missionaries on Bourbon Street.\n\nHalfway through this one, Utah trails four-win New Orleans 41-36.\n\nChris Kaman and Marco Belinelli each have 10 points for the Hornets (4-23), who only have nine players available for this game because of injuries.\n\nRaja Bell leads the Jazz (14-12) with 11 points, including three 3-pointers, and Al Jefferson has 10 points.\n\nOther than that, though, the Utah offense has been nonexistent. The Jazz are shooting 39 percent against a New Orleans defense that has been effecitvely using zone to befuddle the visitors.\n\nEMAIL: jody@desnews.com\n\nTWITTER: DJJazzyJody"
