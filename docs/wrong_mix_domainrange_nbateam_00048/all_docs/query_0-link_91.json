        "text": "On Mother’s Day Weekend, the NBA Draft Lottery happened. The Charlotte Hornets secured the sixth pick in the upcoming draft. Last season, the Hornets finished with a 21-61 record, and it seemed like they would have received a top-five pick.\n\nHowever, that isn’t the case. The first ten picks of the upcoming NBA Draft go as follows:\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nHouston Rockets (from the Brooklyn Nets)\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nPortland Trailblazers\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (from the Toronto Raptors)\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nThe Last Five Charlotte Hornets First Round Draft Picks\n\nIn the 2023 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets secured Brandon Miller in the first round with the second overall pick. The great scorer from Alabama averaged roughly 17-4-2 in his rookie year. He also shot 44% from the floor and 37% from beyond the arc. The Hornets also picked up Nick Smith Jr. with the 27th pick last year and he was a role player for them.\n\nIn the 2022 NBA Draft, they selected Jalen Duran and Mark Williams in the first round. Jalen Duran bounced to the Knicks and the Pistons. Mark Williams has been injured in his first two seasons with the team. The Hornets picked him up as they desperately needed a traditional big man to grab the boards. That’s been a missing piece for their team since Al Jefferson was on the squad. Hopefully, he can be healthier entering his third year with them.\n\nThe other first-round draft picks they had in the last five years were James Bouknight, Lamelo Ball, and P.J. Washington. P.J. Washington was a good stretch four that could use a bit more muscle, but now he’s a key piece to the Dallas Mavericks, who are currently in the playoffs.\n\nLamelo Ball and Brandon Miller On The Hornets\n\nLaMelo Ball has been a solid player WHEN he has been healthy, with emphasis on WHEN. He has had a series of injuries that kept him on the sidelines. He averaged 24-5-8 last season but only played for 22 games, so his stats may be inflated due to how little he played due to injuries.\n\nThe one-time All-Star would show glimpses of his floor general potential as a point guard but rarely finished seasons. The Hornets hope Lamelo and Brandon Miller can play more games together to build up their chemistry. With Brandon Miller possibly becoming the primary scoring option or a secondary scoring option, thanks to Miles Bridges’s productivity, Lamelo would have no problem creating plays for them two.\n\nWho Does The Hornets Take With The 6th Pick?"
