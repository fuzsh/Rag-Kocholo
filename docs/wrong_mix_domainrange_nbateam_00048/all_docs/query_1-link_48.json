        "text": "The Charlotte Bobcats opened their last season under the moniker “Bobcats” with a new coach and a positive outlook on the 2013 season. Among those invited to tryout for the team includes some interesting options for the Bobcats should they make the team. Before going into detail about the roster and the roles that the players will ultimately take, I wanted to examine the long shots in camp and try to figure out how likely it is that they will make the Charlotte roster come opening night. Knowing that there are only 12 players that are able to suit up on a given night, I wanted to take players that will make the roster and throw them out for this conversation. So we will look at players like Kemba Walker, MKG, Gerald Henderson, Ramon Sessions, Ben Gordon, Cody Zeller, Al Jefferson, Jeff Taylor, Bismack Biyombo, Brendan Haywood, and Josh McRoberts individually at another point. For those keeping track, that is 11 players. That leaves 1 roster spot open for the team, and they have several interesting options on how to fill the spot. Without further ado, let’s take a look at the 3 most interesting players.\n\nOption #1: Jannero Pargo\n\nThe Positives: Pargo played for the Bobcats for 18 games last year and was relatively effective in his role, posting the 2nd highest PER of his career with a 14.1. The veteran out of Arkansas would give the Bobcats a 3rd option at point guard behind Walker and Sessions, and has been a serviceable backup in the league. With Pargo, you really kind of know what you are getting, and that can be a luxury for teams, especially at the PG position.\n\nThe Negatives: When you know what you are getting, it can also be a detriment to the chances to make a roster, as potential is huge in the NBA. Pargo also posts a higher shots per minute than Kemba Walker, and unless you have the dynamic playmaking ability of Walker, you really want your point guard to be able to distribute at a higher rate than what Pargo showed last year.\n\nChance He is the 12th Man: 40%. Pargo has stuck around the NBA during his career for a reason. He is a veteran who could add an established voice to a relatively young roster and help with the development of Walker. When you add those factors to the fact that he will be able to add depth to the point guard position, he is the most likely of these 3 players to play a role for the team this season.\n\nOption #2: Patrick O’Bryant\n\nThe Positives: O’Bryant was selected in the lottery in 2006, and there is a reason why teams were so high on him. It’s hard to find legit 7-footers and his size would be an asset to the Bobcats if he is able to hang on the roster. He averaged double digits in minutes played per game just once, and that resulted in his most efficient season. If he gets the chance to play, the hope would be that the statistic would continue to show improvement. Coach Clifford also has a lot of experience with big men and could help the development of O’Bryant.\n\nThe Negatives: For a 7-footer, O’Bryant does not rebound very well, posting the lowest total rebounding percent among himself, Biyombo, Haywood, Jefferson, and McRoberts. He is not a particularly strong free throw shooter at a lifetime 58.3%, and that is a liability late in games. He has been coached by Don Nelson and Doc Rivers, and both let him go, which is telling.\n\nChance He is the 12th Man: 35%. Size is always needed in the NBA, and O’Bryant has that in spades. While he has yet to show the potential that made him a top-10 pick in the draft, Clifford’s experience developing players like Dwight Howard might just make this a somewhat logical choice for the Bobcats. However, O’Bryant will have to impress early and often during camp as he has already showed that he might not have the ability to stick on an NBA roster so far in his career.\n\nOption #3: James Southerland\n\nThe Positives: Southerland was a deadly shooter during his time at Syracuse, and could give the Bobcats the ability to spread the floor and give Jefferson and Zeller more space in the post. He has true NBA athleticism. Played for Jim Boeheim while in college and Syracuse players generally translate well into the NBA. The main positive about Southerland is the fact that he has the ability to get hot from 3-point range and score in bunches when called upon.\n\nThe Negatives: The defensive acumen of Syracuse players has been questioned in the past, as they come from a strict zone scheme and that makes it hard to truly know how well the players will be able to guard when outside of the system. Southerland also doesn’t rebound well for someone his size, which is not a desirable trait for a team like Charlotte that occasionally struggles on the glass. Also, while Southerland is an excellent shooter, he does not really have the ability to create his own shot, preferring to be a catch-and-shoot option.\n\n-by James Boger-\n\nChance He is the 12th Man: 25%. The Bobcats have an option similar to Southerland on the roster in Jeff Taylor. If Southerland doesn’t show a true defensive ability, it will be hard to imagine him being a 12th man on this roster when you consider the emphasis that Clifford has put on that end of the floor. However, his shooting ability has the potential to carry him into the roster.\n\n*We would like to take this opportunity to publicly welcome James Boger to the “Bring Back The Buzz” Blog Team. His category for the blog will be called “James Boger’s Buzz” and this is his inaugural post. If you are interested in reading more by James, check out his website Inside Charlotte Sports *\n\nThe 2013-14 season is one that will shape the Bobcats for years to come. The team, marred in embarrassment and the type records you want to avoid, has shown that they are ready to reverse recent trends and win now. The offseason has brought moves that signify this with almost reckless abandon. For one, signing a player like Al Jefferson to a contract worth more than $35 million shows that the team has the ability and the will to sign a big name player to bring talent to Charlotte. When you put that move with the drafting of Co dy Zeller, who is extremely talented and is able to contribute immediately but lacks the “ceiling” of some players drafted after him like Ben McLemore and Nerlens Noel, you have a mix of talent ready to climb out of the basement of the NBA hierarchy. One year before the team sheds the moniker of the Bobcats and transitions to the Hornets name that has so much weight in the Queen City, one question remains to the fans: Why now?\n\nBeing negative doesn’t accomplish much, but when you look at the variables that the team has been presented with, one has to question what is going on with the Bobcats. The experts are predicting one of the most talented draft classes in recent memory. These classes can take teams from being part of the bottom rung of the NBA and turn them into the upper class with the speed and cap flexibility that most can only dream of. One only has to look at the storied class of 2003 to see the impact that truly memorable classes can have on franchises. When you are able to refer to most of these players by their first names and get immediate recognition it just shows how much certain teams were impacted by the presence of players like Lebron, Carmelo, and Dwyane. Will the 2014 class bring more of the same? It’s hard to tell at this point, but the Bobcats have thrown caution to the wind and decided to win in the now over the ever possible light at the end of the tunnel that seems so close to the fans that have persevered through the past 2 seasons. While no one is predicting a championship run for the Charlotte franchise, they might have found the right mix of players to show flashes of a contender while remaining with enough lottery chances to get a player that could push them over the hump.\n\nThis is a hard thing to explain, but when you look at the team, the simple fact is that while the Bobcats aren’t going to make a lot of noise this year but have the potential to do some serious damage if a couple things (read: Ping Pong Balls) bounce their way. When you look at how the lottery has gone since Orlando “won” it and selected Dwight Howard, the team that had the average % chance of ending up with the eventual #1 pick was awarded to was equivalent to the 5th highest chances. The moral of the story is that you can’t depend on outside forces to make yourself better: you have to take fate into your own hands and hope that along the way the odds will be in your favor and actually come through. For any Charlotte sports fan, this is not a particularly hopeful situation. Some might not agree with how this team has been ran in the past, and I for one think the strategy that is being used is a mistake, but at least there is a clear plan. That is something this team needs, and something this city deserves. The Bobcats have the unique plan to be bad enough to continue to build the team through the draft while making strides of improvement enough to keep an already disgruntled fan base interested enough to continue to buy tickets. It’s a strategy that has a very small margin of true victory, and the Charlotte front office is banking on the fact that they took the gamble at the right moment. Only time will tell, but it is clear that this season will go a long way to determine if the team will usher in a new era of success to go along with the Hornets name change in 2014.\n\nDue to the recent struggles of the Charlotte Bobcats, the organization has had the luxury of several lottery picks. While most of the youngsters have first honed their skills at powerhouse D1 schools like Indiana, Kentucky, Connecticut and Duke, the Bobcats strayed away from that trend in 2011 when they picked up Bismack Biyombo. After two seasons, the undersized center from the Congo has yet to make a significant impact. In year three, it might just be a make or break year for the 21 year old.\n\nBiyombo went from possibly second rounder to a lottery talent in a matter of weeks in the spring of 2011. Many teams fell in love with his long limbs and raw ability. Although he is just 6’9”, he is able to play like a true seven footer thanks to his build. It was unanimously accepted that his offense was a work in progress, but then again, so was fellow countryman Serge Ibaka.\n\nOne thing that has hurt Biyombo is that he simply does not have the type of talent surrounding him as Ibaka. It is hard to get minutes on a team that has trouble scoring, when in fact you can’t score yourself. His 5.0 points per game average is not making him a daily fantasy sports star by any means. In fact, his only promising daily fantasy sports statistics right now are his rebounds and blocked shots.\n\nHeading into the 2013-2014 season, Biyombo’s minutes will definitely be challenged. First, the Bobcats took Cody Zeller with the 4th overall pick to help provide some offense down low. Then, management went out and signed Al Jefferson to a favorable deal, allowing them to possibly add two starters to their frontcourt.\n\nIn Year 3, Biyombo might be able to settle into a nice role as an energy bench player. He will still have to play 20-30 minutes a game, but he can focus on what he is instead of what he isn’t. He probably is never going to be a guy who can be relied on in daily fantasy sports to put up numbers, but he can be a productive rotation player who hustles and provides value on the defensive end. That’s probably not the value the Bobcats were hoping out of the #7 overall pick, but Biyombo just seems lost on offense.\n\nWell a lot of the people who questioned the change to the Hornets have been silenced. The skeptics wondered about whether or not our claims of a resurgence of fan support would be validated when the time came. Boy was it!\n\nHere are some quotes from Pete Guelli (Executive Vice President and chief sales and marketing officer)\n\n“New ticket sales are up 59 percent from last year.”\n\n“What’s really encouraging about that is the vast majority of those people have taken advantage of the two-year season ticket program,”\n\n“The number of fans signing up for the two-year plan accounted for more than 50 percent of new sales.”\n\n“We’re very close on a number of new sponsorships,” Guelli said. “There are many, many companies that have not been interested for a number of reasons that are entertaining dialogue around the return of the Hornets.\n\n“That’s where it all starts. If you can get in, have a constructive dialogue. This rebrand has opened up a number of doors that had remained closed since Mr. (Robert) Johnson purchased the team.”\n\n“A slow window turned into a hot sales opportunity,” Guelli said. “The sales in our team stores have doubled this summer from where they were last year.”\n\n“The universal support has created a lot of momentum internally and you can only achieve these numbers if you have motivated employees and this rebrand has helped us do that,”\n\n-rebrand will cost 3 Million\n\n“We’re almost there right now,” Guelli said. “The fact that (ticket sales) are going to occur over a two-year period … When we calculate those numbers on top of what we know we’re going to do from sponsors, we’re almost there, so moving forward we’ll be looking at upside.”\n\nWe’ve also been told that the “Buzz City” apparel has 100% turn around in the team store. This is extremely encouraging to see this type of support for this franchise considering that just last year we came in 24th for home attendance when compared to the other teams in the NBA. Now we are in the top 10 for ticket sales in the NBA and the season hasn’t even started yet.\n\nRUMORS:\n\n*What you are about to read has not been validated by the Charlotte Bobcats organization*\n\nOnce again we have some more news from “the inside”. This has been told to us by a couple people very close to the rebranding process.\n\nThey said that at this point in the process a logo has not been chosen yet but they do have 8 potentials for the Hornets. The majority of these and the most popular ones are sticking to original Hugo look but with a little bit more aggressive twist, a more muscular Hugo with “angrier” eyes and expression. Which is refreshing considering the complete “sissification” that happened to the Hornets brand in New Orleans. They realize the value of the brand loyalty and recognition and don’t want to ruin that.\n\nSome logos are completely different but are not getting as strong support as those similar to the original Hugo.\n\nTo answer the question that has been bothering so many people. Pete Guelli also said that they have not finalized a color scheme but for the time being are using the Carolina Blue for legal reason not yet fixed with the league.\n\nNow our source has stated that most of the design proposals are sticking with the TEAL & PURPLE as the main colors and may use the Carolina Blue for small “details”. This will give them ability to make more apparel designs.\n\nAgain this is all hearsay. Take all this with a grain of salt.\n\nSTAY TUNED! We will bring you the BUZZ as soon as we hear"
