        "text": "When I talked to Coach Clifford, he told me I'm not as bad a defensive player as I try to make myself to be. On the defensive end it's just effort and having the energy to do the things you're supposed to do. Here I am in my 10th year, and all of a sudden I'm on a team that’s been top 10 in defense this whole year – number six if I'm not mistaken now.\n\nI think it was just more mind over matter. I guess I have to admit that I was lazy and I wanted to save my energy on the offensive end. But as I got older and (began) understanding what it takes to win, I've got to have that energy on both ends."
