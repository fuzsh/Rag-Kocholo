        "text": "A person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Indiana Pacers have agreed to terms with big man Al Jefferson on a three-year contract worth $30 million.\n\nThe Pacers and Jefferson came to terms on Friday afternoon, about 12 hours after the free agent frenzy started. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract cannot be signed until July 7.\n\nThe 31-year-old Jefferson is an old-school post player who missed significant time for the Charlotte Hornets last season with a knee injury.\n\nHe averaged 12.0 points and 6.4 rebounds in 47 games for the Hornets, who also lost Jeremy Lin in free agency on Friday."
