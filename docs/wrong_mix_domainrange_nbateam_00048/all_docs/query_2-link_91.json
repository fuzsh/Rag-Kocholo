        "text": "Charlotte Bobcats center Al Jefferson suffered a sprained ankle last week, but told the Charlotte Observer that it is \"very realistic\" he'll play in the season opener on Oct. 30.\n\nJefferson, 28, left the Utah Jazz to sign with the Bobcats this summer and is widely regarded as one of the most talented offensive big men in the league. It's an encouraging sign for the team that he thinks he will be healthy for the start of the regular season.\n\n\"The doctor made it clear it’s just a low ankle sprain. It’s very realistic (to play in the opener). If it were up to me, I’d be (out) another week, but I understand they want to take it really slow.\"\n\nRead more here: http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/10/16/4393227/bobcats-center-al-jefferson-says.html#.Ul8utVCThbF#storylink=cpy\n\nIt makes sense that the Bobcats would want to \"take it really slow.\" The three-year contract he signed this offseason was worth $41 million. That's the type of investment that needs to be protected with due diligence and an intelligent rehab. Jefferson brings a presence down low that the Bobcats haven't had in years; he averaged 17.8 points and 9.2 rebounds last season with the Jazz.\n\nThe Bobcats open their season at Houston to take on Dwight Howard and the Rockets. Having a healthy Jefferson back will play a big part if the team wants to win its first tough road test of the year.\n\nMore from SB Nation NBA:\n\n• Flinder Boyd: 20 minutes at Rucker Park\n\n• Flannery: LeBron belongs to history | Tjarks: Wade must evolve\n\n• The Hook: Why the rush to sign Andrew Bogut?\n\n• Celebrity Hot Tub: The Space Jam soundtrack as NBA roster"
