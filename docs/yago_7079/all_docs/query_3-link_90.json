        "text": "One of the better ultra-cheap clown horror films is Clownhouse (1989), an unexpectedly effective entry into the growing number of evil clown movies, &amp a few years ahead of the great rush of slasher clown that have proliferated in the first decade of the new millenium.\n\nThis film knows something about clowns many of the films in this subgenre have failed to understand: clowns, regular clowns, are creepy. Not just clowns with fangs, painted to look like the psychos they are, but actual straightforward clowns, the ones purportedly designed with the idea in mind that children should find them amusing &amp pleasing.\n\nWith their smelly pants, floppy shoes, deathly white or greasy technicolor faces or sooty tramp complexions, messy flaming yarn hair, &amp swollen alcoholic-red noses, they are strange for glorifying deformity, worrisome for disguising identity or even humanity, &amp creepy for making expansive jests that are frequently sadistic.\n\nClownhouse knows this. Clowns need no exaggeration beyond the fact that they are clowns.\n\nThe tale convincingly conveys the fear of clowns through the young, surprisingly good performance of Nathan Forrest Winters as Casey, youngest of three brothers. He'll piss his pajamas even at the sight of a picture of a clown. We might not all share his phobia, but it's understandable. It's not like being afraid of kittens, they're fucking clowns for crying sake.\n\nIt's mid-October. The circus has come to town &amp Casey's brothers are eager to attend, after school. Mom &amp dad leave town, with oldest brother Randy (Sam Rockwell) having responsibility for the younger boys, though Randy's not all that responsible a young man.\n\nEveryone's assuming Casey's gotten over the terror of clowns he experienced the previous year, for he strives to suffer silently, especially as Randy teases him mercillessly about clowns. His middle brother, Geoff, tries to be supportive, &amp is generally more mature than the obnoxious eldest.\n\nCasey tries to enjoy the carnival that evening, while sidestepping the clowns. He's very curious about the fortuneteller (Gloria Belsky). Randy thinks it's a waste of money, but Geoff says to let him do what he wants.\n\nThe fortuneteller is pretty damned creepy, though she gives a positive reading as one would expect to be done for a kid -- until she looks closely at his lifeline, &amp goes quiet &amp concerned. \"Something very smooth -- is cutting through your lifeline. Take great care!\" And she goes all batshit spooky as the three boys flee the fortuneteller's tent.\n\nDespite that the film's primary characters are kids, there's no sense of it being only a children's horror film.\n\nI expect kids would like it, but circuses of this kind are part of the fabric of a former generation of American fact &amp mythology. The terrors represented are bound to be more familiar to adult viewers. Plus the young actors are good enough to be captivating in their own right, especially Casey as he deals with things very like, if not exactly like, dark echoes of every childhood.\n\nThe first attempt of a \"nice\" clown to entice a child, closely observed by nervous Casey, really is bizarrely unsettling, though nothing definitively untoward. It's Cheezo the Clown, supported by three other clowns performing in the circus ring while Casey sits stern-faced &amp observant. But then Cheezo tries to grab Casey out of the audience to be part of the act, &amp he takes off out of the tent, screaming for all he's worth.\n\nGeoff chases after him &amp calms him down, tries to make him feel less of a chickenshitted idiot. \"You know what I used to be afraid of? The Wolfman. I don't know why. I know he isn't real.\"\n\nWe're about to get a point-of-view, for the first time, outside of Casey's perspective of looming threat. There is a scene late that night when the circus has closed, &amp the clowns are cleaning off their make-up. They're just regular old bozos, &amp they're even a bit distraught to have scared a kid so badly earlier in the evening. Phobias are irrationial after all, &amp these clowns mean no harm whatsoever.\n\nWhen the lights go out in the tent, &amp the circus animals are screaming, it's the clowns we suddenly worry about. By now we know that they are not going to be the problem, but we do have clues that someone on the prowl, with an unwholesome interest in the art of clowning.\n\n\"Get away from the tent please!\" shouts one of the clowns, half out of his make-up. \"Show's over!\" yells another of the clowns, shadows deep around them.\n\nOh, I can't reveal it, I just can't, but we soon understand that even professional clowns can have reasons to be afraid of clowns! The editing is so tight, the quietly sinister music so perfect, &amp then...\n\nA psycho gathers up all the clown make-up, costumes, &amp paraphernalia he can carry. Soon in company with two other lunatics who escaped from the town's mental asylum, three clowns are wandering the night. Mom's away &amp Randy, though not terribly reliable, is responsible for his little brothers. The headcase who has stolen Cheezo's make-up design seems to know exactly which house of the boy who most fears clowns -- &amp the parents are away.\n\nThe typical psycho killer movie just picks off teenagers one by one, no plot required. But by right of having pre-teens as the primary cast, an iota of good taste seeped in, if only an iota. Hence this is going to be in great part a story of heroism in the face of terror, as Casey does everything he can to protect his brothers from what he is first to recognize as a threat.\n\nFor instance, when Randy's decided to walk through the woods to a ma/pa grocery down the way a bit, Casey unexpectedly decides to go with him, scared shitless but not wanting Randy alone if the clowns try to get him. This is effing brave, &amp an effective set of woods-by-night scenes follow Casey's terrific decision.\n\nAnd when Casey tries to convince his brother, \"The clowns, Randy. The clowns. They're here,\" even unsupportive Randy has to feel for the kid, for the first time sounding concerned when he replies, \"Casey, you are the weirdest brother I've ever had.\" Luckily they make it home through the night. But the clowns will get in the house.\n\nIn order to have a quota of slaughter without hacking up children, the story takes a small turn with the farmer down the road, just long enough to provide disgusting clowning bloody doom.\n\nThe three kids on their own watching a video tape &amp eating popcorn, suddeny the lights blow out, &amp the clowns have gained entrance. It's stalker time, &amp I tell ya, I rarely worry about the dumbass teenagers in most films of this kind because they're never well drawn characters. These three kids, by contrast, had me on the edge of my seat for the rest of the film!\n\nNone of it is funny, though now &amp then I got a giggle, like when Casey serious as all hell wants Randy to call the police &amp says, \"Call Officer Friendly.\" Officer Friendly? There are a few little touches like that which don't quite break the tense mood but remind us this is just a movie, &amp we've all just got to be having fun.\n\nI'm just impressed with the script, too. In most such films there's a \"dumbass goes alone in the basement\" scene which is just so stupid. But this time it fits in the script convincingly when none of the boys have the nerve to go up in the attic to check the fusebox, &amp draw straws to see who does it.\n\nThey've not yet seen what we've seen, that clowns lurk in shadows, &amp really it won't matter if one, two, or all three go in the attic. Or anywhere else in the house. It's a gawdamn nightmare no matter what they do. And no sense of any of these lads being just too stupid to deserve life, which is frankly what I feel a lot of the time about the boring teenage victims of less imaginative films about psychopaths.\n\nIt takes so long for the kids to realize clowns are hiding nearby that it does get a bit dull, but not unbearably so.\n\nWhen Randy elects to dress up as a clown to scare Casey in the dark, hidden Cheezo &amp his two buddies look scowly &amp upset. All hell breaks loose for Randy as the clowns reveal themselves at last. The fight is on, Casey &amp Geoffrey vs the three loonies.\n\nSuch sensitive direction of child actors is surprising in a horror cheapie. Alas, the \"sensitive\" director turned out to be a pedarast &amp shortly after filming Clownhouse was arrested for molesting the kid who played Casey, so Victor Salva turns out to have been the real Cheezo, a pure nightmare for children.\n\nSalva's pedarasty is ultimately the only reason not to spend money on this film, as who wants to put dollars in the mits of a registered sex offender. With a simple web search you can find it on-line available to watch for free, &amp I'd recommend that just so that you won't give even one penny in support of a molestor. You wouldn't think anyone like that would ever find anyone to back further filmmaking, but he went on to make the rather competent Jeepers Creepers films, &amp even did work for Disney, living up to his long history of trying to get work where children are within reach.\n\nHere is the \"unrated\" direct to video release of DeadHouse (2005). I'm glad to rate it for them. And I rate it a turd. And be sure to note the \"special\" capitalization of the title, as nothing else is going to be so clever.\n\nTeens Lisa, Christina &amp Brandon (Tracey Dalton, Cara Dalton &amp Anthony Carvalho) are kidnapped by cloyingly upbeat psychopaths Victor &amp Kain (Shaun Israel &amp director Pablo Macho Maysonet IV; these two really were boyhood friends &amp their film comes off as the work of small boys who've mistaken themselves for filmmakers).\n\nTrapped &amp tormented in the run-down residence of the happy nutters, there's a lot of running about &amp a few gore FX. Because psycho Victor wears a clown mask, this one is marginally apropos of \"clown horror\" sub-genre, but only barely.\n\nAmateur from start to finish, the best thing you can say about how badly these would-be actors deliver lines is the sound recording is so bad you don't actually have to hear what they're saying. The video digital cinematography isn't much better than the sound. And the script -- what script! The content attempted is so generic no script was required.\n\nDigital video has made it possible for would-be filmmakers with no money &amp no knowledge of how to make a feature film to make one anyway. From lighting to musical score, they've gotten nothing even close to right, but a good painting of a scary clown on the package (because no still from the film could possibly appeal to anyone) &amp some of us will be tricked into giving it a try.\n\nIt's getting harder &amp harder for B-horror film fans to know what is going to be a sleezy cool trasho-filmo, &amp what is a digital-video home movie with little to no entertainment value.\n\nSome of the set-ups for grue aren't completely bad but the filmmakers lacked the skills to really capture what they were attempting to frame. And making the psychos vaguely likeable should've been a good touch. But it's just so massively awful, nothing that was the least bit likely to lend interest to DeadHouse ever quite gets through.\n\nPablo &amp his fellow school chums have continued to make movies. Maybe they're getting better at it, but I lack sufficient faith to have any desire to find out.\n\nFunland (1986) has an occasionally effective sense of the absurd, mixing parody with satire. Unfortunately the dvd copy looks like a transfer of a color-runny vhs copy &amp cinematography is often out of focus.\n\nThe film was formerly packaged as a gangster spoof, but is presently being packaged as a psycho clown movie, which is completely misleading. The clown in the story is certainly mentally ill, but harmlessly so, as this is strictly a comedy.\n\nFilmed at Six Flags Over Georgia in Cobb County, Georgia, having access to hundreds of acres of theme park rides &amp locations greatly helped with the low budget, though they weren't permitted to film the Monster ride or Thomas the Train Land or the D.C. Comics characters or the Wild West show. What they did access gives the impression of a more generic Funland than was necessary, but I can understand clearing permission to include trademarked &amp copyrighted images &amp characters would be beyond this film's budget.\n\nBruce Burger (David L. Lander, best known as Squiggy on Laverne &amp Shirley) is a spokesman-clown for a national pizza chain. Neil has long held the local rights to be Bruce the Clown for the local franchise which is a major advertiser for Funland, a summer retreat for families &amp teens where Neil can live as Bruce pretty much full time.\n\nHaving had a nervous breakdown before the film started, Bruce has largely forgotten he was ever Neil, plus he seems to think his phallic handpuppet, Pete the Pepperoni, really is his best friend.\n\nHe's inept at being a clown &amp really ought to be fired, except the owner of Funland, Angus (William Windom), has a fatherly fondness for Neil, &amp completely accepts him in his post-breakdown beleif that he really is Bruce.\n\nBecause Funland is being marketed as horror we keep waiting for Bruce to go psycho &amp kill people. In one scene we see everyone from dysfunctional families to young lovers to nuns to Klan members in sheets enjoying the carival atmosphere of Funland, so when Bruce takes a high-powered rifle up to Funland's clocktower, we expect a whole mess of comedy killings. But he's a terrible shot that everyone's safe.\n\nParodying The Godfather, a mafia family has assassinated Angus making it look like a suicide. They took over Funland to use it to launder money while they run it into the ground, with the intent of eventually using the land for bigger development projects. But first they must find the key stockholder, who the gangsters would like to make an offer he can't refuse. Only they don't know Bruce is Neil, the clown they've recently fired.\n\nBeing certifiable though harmless, Bruce has moved into the closed-down Wax Museum with his imaginary friends. The wax figure of Humphrey Bogart (Robert Sacchi) is alive for him, as for Woody Allen in Play It Again Sam (1972). Sacchi also plays the godfather figure Mario Dimaurio, proving he really can play something beyond The Man with Bogart's Face (1980).\n\nAlso keeping him company in the wax museum is the ghost of Angus, pluks of course Pete the Peperoni. Together they plot to save Funland. Bruce has swiped a rifle from hitman Larry (Richard Reiner). Phase one of his plan is to take a sniper's shot at Chad (Lane Davies), the national Bruce the Clown whose existence so much annoys our Bruce.\n\nChad is a Shakespearean actor who hates children &amp hates being a clown, but being a national advertising symbol pays so much better. In his clown wig practicing lines of Shakespeare alone in his dressing room, he's a hoot.\n\nHe in no way deserves to be Neil/Bruce's target for death, &amp as a comedy, we won't really have to worry about him, since our crazy hero couldn't hit the side of a barn. He can, however, in this film's upbeat goofiness, easily be mistaken for the \"hero clown\" who stopped hitman Larry from killing people, leading to a happy ending &amp the salvation of Funland for the benefit of mankind.\n\nCrowded with silly jokes, this is an eccentric enough film to forgive it any weakness. The side character of security guard Darlene Dorkner (Bonnie Turner, a writer for Saturday Night Live in its classic period, &amp writer/producer for some of the best sitcoms, rarely seen in front of a camera) is almost worth the whole show.\n\nAlmost anyone who thought they were getting a slasher horror film will be very unhappy with it, but for anyone who expected an off-kilter satire with touches of black comedy, it's perfectly enjoyable.\n\nContinue to:\n\nPsycho Clowns\n\ncopyright © by Paghat the Ratgirl"
