        "text": "Victor Salva, the director of the hit movie Jeepers Creepers is unleashing a new terror onto the masses with his new film Rosewood Lane. Finally, there has been a casting sighting, and it’s none other then ex Scream starlet Rose McGowan. Read more to see what the director has to say about Rosewood Lane.\n\nThere had been talks of Gina Phillips playing the lead character in the film, but it seems as if they decided to go with McGowan as the star. Producer Phillip B Goldfine states: “Rose fully embodies the lead character, and with her strong cult following I can see audiences as they enjoy watching the horrific experiences her character goes through.”\n\nWith the announcement of this casting, Salva decided to make a few comments of his own to clear up some rumors. Speaking to Shock Till You Drop, Salva said this: “There are a lot of surprises in store for Jeepers fans, genre fans, Rose McGowan fans and just anyone who enjoys a very smart and truly chilling ‘jump-out-of-your seat’ scare fest. But we want everything about Rosewood Lane to remain a mystery until the film is ready to flicker onto movies screens. The true stuff about Rosewood that I have seen online, is the most exciting stuff: That we have the wonderful and beautiful Rose McGowan and a script I have been wanting and waiting to make for a very long time. There is something to be said about the unique kind of horror and suspense that is created with a well told suburban nightmare, which is how I would describe Rosewood Lane.”\n\n“Suburban nightmares are powerful because they are stories that as you watch them, you realize they could easily happen on your own street in your own town. That really gives thrillers like this the ability to get under your skin. And one of the great pleasures for me in finally putting this chiller in front of the cameras, is that Rosewood Lane harkens back to some of my favorite and classic thrillers like Carpenter’s Halloween and Bob Clark’s Black Christmas.”"
