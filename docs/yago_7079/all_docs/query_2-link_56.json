        "text": "A director convicted of molesting a child actor in 1988, several years before working on films for Disney and directing the successful Jeepers Creepers slasher franchise, has been condemned for including comedic references to child sex abuse in his latest film.\n\nIn 1988, a then 30-year-old Victor Salva was sentenced to three years in prison for molesting the 12-year-old star of his debut film Clownhouse, along with filming one of their encounters and possessing child pornography. He ended up serving just 15 months.\n\n\"He spent the better part of a year grooming me and my parents,\" actor Nathan Forrest Winters said earlier this year. \"Developing the trust. It was very calculated, and a long process, as it is with most paedophiles.\"\n\nDespite his conviction, Salva began working again in the mid-Nineties, where his films included the 1995 Disney film Powder and the Francis Ford Coppola-produced monster movie Jeepers Creepers, which has spawned two sequels.\n\nThe latest, which was released this month in the US, faced controversy during its casting process, when the Union of British Columbia Performers released a statement to Canadian casting agents warning that Salva was looking for an 18-year-old actress to portray a 13-year-old girl in the film. The ad was subsequently dropped from an array of casting sites.\n\nDespite the warning, the role was eventually filled by actress Gabrielle Haugh, who has appeared on the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, while early reviews of the film noted that the film includes explicit references to her character's sexual abuse.\n\nIn the film, Haugh's character Addison is a runaway whose estranged relationship with her stepfather is alluded to have involved sexual abuse. While no scenes depict her molestation, two other characters share an exchange in which they express sympathy for her abuser.\n\n\"Can you blame the step-dad, though?\" one character says. \"I mean, look at her. The heart wants what it wants, am I right?\"\n\nThe scene, which was featured in screener copies of the film sent in advance to critics, has subsequently been removed from the version of the film publicly screened and released on DVD. Despite the change, and the fact that Victor Salva's name does not appear on press releases for the film mailed to journalists by its distributor, observers have condemned the scene and Salva's continued employment in the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Winters is planning a documentary about his molestation and the prevalence of paedophilia in Hollywood, releasing a statement to Horror Fuel in which he said: \"The film will show my journey from victim to survivor. It is my belief that we as a whole in this country have been too afraid to face such an unspeakable topic and continue to turn a blind eye, which has allowed these predators of our children to go unchecked for too long.\n\n\"United, victims and survivors and parents and children can make this world safer. Education is prevention, and the more light we shed on this darkest of crimes, the fewer shadows there will be for them to hide.\""
