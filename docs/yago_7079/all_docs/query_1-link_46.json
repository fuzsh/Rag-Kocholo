        "text": "As reported by Bloody Disgusting earlier this week, Jeepers Creepers 3 is looking to start production in Vancouver next month, with Gina Phillips allegedly set to reprise her role from the first movie. And yet many fans may not be familiar with the criminal past of franchise director Victor Salva: a 15 month prison stint for sexually molesting Nathan Forrest Winters, the 12-year-old star of his 1989 horror film Clownhouse.\n\nSince JC3 was first announced, outrage has been brewing over Salva's involvement, but is it possible to separate the artist from the art? For some, it clearly isn't; for others, knowledge of the director's terrible act won't preclude them from enjoying the franchise's long-awaited third entry.\n\nOn this week's episode of HitFix's new horror chat series Nightmare Fuel, I discuss the complex issue with horror filmmaker, author and Dread Central West Coast contributor Staci Layne Wilson, in addition to the forthcoming Jacob's Ladder remake, which this week announced that David M. Rosenthal (The Perfect Guy) and Michael Ealy will direct and star, respectively. But is Rosenthal the right filmmaker to remake one of the most beloved cult horror films of the 1990s?\n\nWatch the new episode above and below.\n\nFollow Staci Layne Wilson on Twitter @staciwilson\n\nMore Nightmare Fuel:\n\nEpisode #1: Horror Movie Anthologies, Southbound & Friday the 13th\n\nEpisode #2: The Witch backlash and that controversial Hellraiser sequel\n\nEpisode #3: Is Suspiria the weirdest horror remake idea ever?\n\nEpisode #4: Is a 10 Cloverfield Lane backlash inevitable?"
