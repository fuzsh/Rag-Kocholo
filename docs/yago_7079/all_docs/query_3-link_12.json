        "text": "At the center of the film Clownhouse is 12-year-old Casey (Nathan Forrest Winters), the youngest of three brothers. Casey suffers from an intense case of coulrophobia, the fear of clowns. Though he’s ribbed by older brothers Geoffrey (Brian McHugh) and Randy (Sam Rockwell), the trio seems to be a pretty tightly-knit family.\n\nThe boys are left alone in their farmhouse while their parents are out of town and decide to visit a traveling circus that’s coming to their town. Unbeknownst to the brothers, three psychotically violent mental patients have escaped from a nearby mental institution and are also headed toward the big top.\n\nOnce Casey and his brothers arrive at home, they are soon under attack by three killers in clown costumes.\n\nThe power to the home is cut off, the police won’t believe Casey’s story when he phones them, and there are no adults in sight to come to the rescue. Clownhouse becomes even more paralyzing when the killers make their way into the homes, giving audiences a scare that they won’t soon forget.\n\nClownhouse has become a forgotten entry in the horror genre largely due to the actions of its director, Victor Salva.\n\nBefore the film was released at Sundance in 1989, Salva was convicted of sexually abusing the film’s star, Nathan Forrest Winters. Salva was sentenced to serve three years in prison, but was released after only 15 months.\n\nThe controversy ruined the reception of an otherwise stellar production. While Clownhouse grew a pretty good following in the early 1990s, efforts to bring the film to new audiences in the early 2000s fell flat when MGM’s DVD release was prematurely pulled from the shelves in 2003.\n\nProtests about the film and threats of a boycott forced the distributor’s hand.\n\nMuch of why Clownhouse only holds a 33% score on Rotten Tomatoes is from Salva’s unforgivable actions. When I first watched the film in 1990, the fear I was filled with was the result of the clowns on the screen. Sadly, the lead actor was subjected to horrors at the hand of a real-life human monster that didn’t hide behind a wig and makeup.\n\nREVIEW SCORE\n\nAll controversy aside, Clownhouse weaves elements of slasher and suspense films into a production that gives great reason to be afraid of what lies behind the painted faces, wigs, and funny costumes.\n\nSolid child acting, eerie cinematography, and a creepy score all make the movie worthy of 4.0/5.0 stars. I’d put these clowns up against Stephen King‘s Pennywise any day in a battle to determine who could frighten children the most.\n\nYou can rent Clownhouse on Prime."
