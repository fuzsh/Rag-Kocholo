        "text": "It was discovered that director Victor Salva had been molesting the film's 12-year-old star, Nathan Forrest Winters, during production. Later it was discovered in Salva's house several videos and pictures of sexual nature of the film's co-star Brian McHugh, indicating he was also molested, but his parents wouldn't let him get involved in the case that was built against Salva.\n\nAt the time director Victor Salva was arrested, everything but the re-looping for this movie had already been completed. Re-dubbing took place during post-production due to the loud noises the cameras made during filming. According to Nathan Forrest Winters, he had to attend to Coppola's house to take part in the re-dubbing for a month, a time in which he was black balled by pretty much everyone and was told by Coppola himself he would never work in the industry again.\n\nShout Factory turned down the chance to license this film from Metro-Goldwyn Mayer for a Blu-ray release as part of their Scream Factory spin-off label. The reason cited was the controversy surrounding the child molestation charges against Victor Salva."
