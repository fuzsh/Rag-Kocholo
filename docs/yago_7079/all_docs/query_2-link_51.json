        "text": "Jeepers Creepers 3 was stuck in development hell for years and it seemed like fans would never get to see what happened 23 years later until last year. Jeepers Creepers 3 crawled its way into theatres for one night due to controversy surrounding Victor Salva’s (Jeepers Creepers, Jeepers Creepers 2) past. For years fans were under the impression that Jeepers Creepers 3, then titled Jeepers Creepers: Cathedral, would pick up 23 years later with Gina Philips (Jeepers Creepers) returning as Trish Jenner to team up with Jack Taggart Sr. (Ray Wise) to put an end to the creeper (Jonathan Breck) once and for all. Sadly that was scrapped for a prequel set inbetween the first two films.\n\nThe only returning cast members present for this 3rd outing were Brandon Smith, Gina Philips, and Jonathan Breck. Shortly before Jeepers Creepers 3 premiered Jonathan Breck had an interview where he explained what happened to the film fans were promised. Cathedral seems to have been turned into a one season series picking up 23 years after the first three films. It is safe to assume that some changes were made to the script as well because it was floating online for a few years. According to Gina Philips she is penciled in for an appearance in Jeepers Creepers 4 which is already written, but since she was the focus of the original script for Jeepers Creepers 3 she could potentially return for the TV series if it ever gets picked up.\n\nInformation about the TV series was made public to us from a source close to Victor Salva in a facebook group called jeepers creepers fans. This individual explained that the reason Jeepers Creepers 3 was changed was because Victor Salva “didn’t want to do the origin story in the lowest budget of the series.” According to the source the series would show the creeper terrorising Poho County again like it did for the first few entries. This backs up what Jonathan Breck was discussing last year regarding the series.\n\nJeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral was planned to end an intended trilogy but since that has been turned into a short series we could see the series premiering first on a streaming service before a 4th film is released. Gina Philips says Jeepers Creepers 4 is ready to go so more than likely the TV series could serve as an introduction to the final films narrative. Fans of the controversial series could be getting a small series set after Jeepers Creepers 2 and then a final film to end it all."
