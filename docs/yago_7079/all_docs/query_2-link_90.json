        "text": "OCALA -- School board members are upset they weren't told that a movie director who is making a low-budget horror film near two Marion County schools was a convicted child molester.\n\nMembers of the Marion County School Board had already agreed to let director Victor Salva and his film crew near Dunnellon Elementary and Dunnellon High School. The school district is being compensated by the movie's production company for longer bus routes caused by the shooting.\n\nWhen they approved the contract, board members weren't told that Salva was a convicted child molester who once videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12-year-old actor in California.\n\nSalva confessed to having oral sex with child actor Nathan Winters in 1987 while directing him in \"Clownhouse,\" a low-budget horror film about three boys terrorized by circus clowns. Salva, sentenced to three years in state prison, served 15 months and completed parole in 1992.\n\nWinters went public with his ordeal in 1995 to protest the release of Salva's film, \"Powder,\" by Walt Disney Studios.\n\nSalva currently is filming a $10 million horror film titled \"Jeepers Creepers\" in Marion County, angering some parents and board members.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that a discussion wasn't held about this,\" school board member Cheryl Appelquist said Wednesday after a board meeting. \"We need to use caution whenever we can.\"\n\nMarion County Film Commissioner Jude Hagin told the school board that she didn't think it was necessary to disclose Salva's past.\n\n\"I did not feel it was necessary to further slander an individual and did not feel one child was in danger,\" she said.\n\n\"Jeepers Creepers\" publicist Joseph Hemingway told the board that Salva is unable to travel by himself because of physical limitations and doesn't pose any threat to minors.\n\nIn addition, sheriff's deputies have been assigned to monitor road closures and keep the set closed, although they will not specially keep and eye on Salva.\n\nHagin said the Sheriff's Office declined her request for an additional officer to be with Salva, referring her to a private security firm available for $55 an hour. She said the production company decided officers on the roads would be enough security for the closed set."
