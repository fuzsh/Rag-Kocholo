        "text": "Mere minutes into “Dark House,” it becomes depressingly clear that the deficit of imagination displayed by the title will not be made up for by the content. (One wonders why the makers even bothered to replace the original name, “Haunted.”) Grabbing off-the-rack ideas — the creepy-crumbly mansion in the woods, the “Deliverance”-style locals, the troubled young man with the weird psychic power — the director, Victor Salva, stuffs them into a plot of resounding silliness.\n\nAbout which the less said the better, so I will merely remark that the aforementioned young man (Luke Kleintank), his heavily pregnant girlfriend (Alex McKenna) and a few interchangeable sidekicks head into those woods and a showdown both biblical and bonkers. Voices leak from heating ducts, bodies hang from a tree, and a three-legged dog makes a pointless appearance. None of which is as unintentionally amusing as the army of ax-wielding henchmen who advance in unison in a sideways crouch, like a chorus line of cave men from a Mel Brooks musical.\n\nFor Mr. Salva, this is a long way down from “Jeepers Creepers,” his respectable little 2001 frightener elevated by genuinely spooky moments and some semblance of logic. Here, instead of terror, we have vapid leads and supporting players who pause to have sex while surrounded by homicidal demons. Sadly, the only thing audiences are likely to find horrific is the acting. Or the possibility that any of these people might make another movie.\n\n“Dark House” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Heads are split, hearts are harvested, and a fetus is terrorized."
