        "text": "I wanted to take advantage of one of the current trends in horror considering Rob Zombie announced 31 which has clowns in it and for the fact that the TV series American Horror Story’s new season is called Freakshow which deals with clowns. A lot of people for some reason in this world suffer from Coulrophobia (a phobia of clowns) and as ridiculous as it sounds, I can understand why. In Clownhouse, one of our main characters has a deep fear of clowns and his worst nightmare is about come alive. Randy (Sam Rockwell), Geoffrey (Brian McHugh), and Casey (Nathan Forrest Winters) are three brothers that are left home alone one night weeks before Halloween. Randy has to take his brothers to the local carnival even though Casey is deathly terrified of clowns. Meanwhile, three inmates break out of the local insane asylum and they kill and take the identities of three clowns at the circus. While on a night of mischief and murder, the three clowns will travel all the to the home where the three brothers are for a night they will never forget. The film also stars Michael Jerome West (The Spirit Of 76) as Lunatic Cheezo, Byron Weible as Lunatic Bippo, David C. Reinecker as Lunatic Dippo, Karl-Heinz Teuber (Amadeus) as real Dippo, Frank Diamanti as Real Bippo, Timothy Enos (The Universe) as Real Cheezo, Gloria Belsky as The Fortune Teller, Viletta Skillman as the mother, and the film was directed by Victor Salva (Jeepers Creepers).\n\nDespite the fact that they took the idea of clowns and brought them to the extreme with this dark take, their was a lot of controversy surrounding the film. The first piece of controversy was it was said that director Victor Salva was accused and convicted of sexually abusing Nathan Forrest Winters during production of this film and he served 15 months of his three year sentence. There was also a lot of trouble behind the release f the film which was not released and then finally released only to have it pulled again which has caused the film to go out of print. I have always told people that so many greats in cinema today got their start in horror movies and the same has happened to Sam Rockwell who makes his feature film debut in this one. I thought about saving this for Cheeseball Cinema, but I thought it was a decent flick even though there were some issues I had. This was the only film that Winters ever starred in and I’m not saying thank god for that, but his acting was a little under par compared to the rest of the guys in the film. There are times in the film where you’re like why would you hide under a table when the clown clearly saw you go under the table. Other than that I did really enjoy watching the film cause it had it’s great moments and you have to give it up to clowns who played the psychological game like the pros spying on their victims and hiding when the victim is about look your way. For a final grade, I am going to give the film a C+/B- because of some of the flaws in the film that are too noticeable."
