        "text": "Livin′ in this modern world everything goes to hell\n\nRioting in the streets, I'm livin′ by my law\n\nRunning an endless race to society's constant struggle\n\nRip it up, tear it down, forget toilet trouble\n\nWhy am I losing sleep so many problems need solved\n\nFighting an endless battle on and on and on\n\nSometimes I really think that maybe I should do the same\n\nI just can't seem to get it right time and time again\n\nI′ve got the key to the clownhouse, it′s mine and mine alone\n\nI'll open the door and jump right in when I feel alone\n\nLife is just a freak show and how much can one take?\n\nWelcome to the center ring a world of fucking snakes\n\nThe sick, the homeless, no set guarantees\n\nStarving in the cold in the streets a part of you and me\n\nChallenge time, break the ice, give this world a song\n\nHold the key in the palm of your hand and still we break the law\n\nThe story of a man who lives in a cardboard box\n\nHe′s tangles and he's webbed all up where do I get off?\n\nLivin′ on travsted hope he's caught himself depression\n\nUse the power of the human mind to destroy all your pressure\n\nSociety′s clownhouse and everyone's a freak\n\nJust paint a smile on the poeple's face you won′t even see their frown\n\nLife is just a circus and now it′s your turn to play\n\nIt's an artificial world you′re livin' in today\n\nAn old lady was hit by a car another hit and run\n\nUsed to live in a trash can amongst the whining scum\n\nThe world to her was just as black as night\n\nNow she lies dead in the street with a pie in her face\n\nWriter(s): michael calabro, casey royer, john knight<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
