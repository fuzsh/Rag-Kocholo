March 29, 2012 – The OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan (OSMFJ) and The OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) announce the release of a new OpenStreetMap layer for Yahoo!JAPAN map services. The new OSM layer is available on Yahoo! JAPAN Local (see the map here)

2011 Yahoo! JAPAN data donation

On March 6th, 2011, Yahoo! JAPAN handed over nation-wide map data to OSMF Japan. The data was originally owned by ALPS corporation, which merged with Yahoo!JAPAN. The OSM community got permission to import and use this data.

Note that the Yahoo! JAPAN ALPS data is not the map data used by Yahoo.com or Yahoo.co.jp. The maps at Yahoo.com and Yahoo.co.jp are not permitted for use by OSM (see the ‘YahooJapanALPS Data’ wiki page).

Mobile maps

The new OSM layer is also available for Yahoo! JAPAN Local mobile. OSM with its frequently updated data is very useful for many map users.
