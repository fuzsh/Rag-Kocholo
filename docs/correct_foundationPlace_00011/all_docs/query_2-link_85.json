        "text": "Yahoo is a company with a storied history that reflects the evolution of the internet itself. Founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo while they were graduate students at Stanford University, Yahoo started as a directory of websites called \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web.\" The name Yahoo is an acronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,\" reflecting its origins as a guide to organize the vast expanse of the early internet.\n\nIn its early years, Yahoo quickly grew in popularity as one of the first and most comprehensive portals on the internet. It offered a range of services including web search, email, news, finance, and more, becoming one of the most visited websites in the world during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Yahoo's rise coincided with the dot-com boom, and it became one of the most prominent symbols of the era's exuberance and innovation.\n\nYahoo's expansion was fueled by strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of Four11, which led to the creation of Yahoo Mail, one of the world's first free web-based email services. The acquisition spree continued with purchases like GeoCities, an early web hosting service, and Broadcast.com, a pioneer in online streaming. However, not all acquisitions were successful, such as the purchase of social networking site GeoCities, which eventually shut down.\n\nOne of Yahoo's most significant milestones was its partnership with Google in 2000, when Yahoo started using Google's search technology to power its search engine. This partnership helped Yahoo improve its search capabilities and gain a larger audience. However, the relationship soured when Google launched its own competing services, leading Yahoo to develop its search technology.Despite its early successes, Yahoo faced challenges in the 2000s as it struggled to compete with emerging internet giants like Google and later Facebook. The company went through multiple CEO changes and strategic shifts in an attempt to regain its footing. In 2008, Microsoft made a bid to acquire Yahoo, but the offer was ultimately rejected by Yahoo's then-CEO, Jerry Yang.One of the most significant turning points in Yahoo's history came in 2012 when Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, was appointed as CEO. Mayer was tasked with revitalizing the struggling company and restoring its relevance in the rapidly changing internet landscape. Under her leadership, Yahoo made several high-profile acquisitions, including the purchase of Tumblr, a popular microblogging platform, and the billion-dollar acquisition of the blogging platform, Yahoo! Sports, Flickr, and more.Despite these efforts, Yahoo continued to face challenges, particularly in its core business of online advertising. The rise of mobile technology further disrupted Yahoo's business model, as users increasingly turned to smartphones and tablets for internet access, where Yahoo had less presence compared to competitors like Google and Facebook.In 2016, Verizon Communications acquired Yahoo's core internet business for $4.83 billion, marking the end of an era for the once-dominant internet company. The sale included Yahoo's email service, search engine, and various digital media properties, while its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Yahoo Japan were spun off into a separate entity called Altaba.Following the acquisition, Yahoo underwent significant restructuring and integration with Verizon's other digital properties, including AOL, to form a new company called Oath, later rebranded as Verizon Media Group. However, the Yahoo brand continued to exist, albeit under different ownership and with a diminished presence compared to its heyday.In 2019, Verizon sold Yahoo and AOL to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion, signaling another chapter in Yahoo's long and complex history. The sale marked the end of Verizon's ambitions in the digital media space and raised questions about the future direction of Yahoo under new ownership.Today, Yahoo remains a recognizable brand with a range of digital media properties, including Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance, and Yahoo Sports. While it may no longer command the same influence and market dominance as it once did, Yahoo continues to play a role in the digital media landscape, serving millions of users worldwide with its various services and platforms. As the internet continues to evolve, Yahoo's fate will likely depend on its ability to adapt to changing trends and technologies, just as it has done throughout its turbulent history."
