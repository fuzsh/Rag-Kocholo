Known as The Peninsula, the area is rich in natural beauty, culture, and entertainment.\n\nPalo Alto\n\nAlthough the University is virtually a community unto itself and even has its own zip codeâ94305âit calls the City of Palo Alto home. Downtown Palo Alto is a short walk from campus and includes many attractions, as well as many shops and restaurants.\n\nStanford Campus Maps\n\nView a searchable campus map and other map resources from Stanford Transportation.\n\nUpdated on February 27, 2024 9:05 AM"
