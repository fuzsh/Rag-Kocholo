        "text": "Overview\n\nThe page lists information for graduating students about forwarding and saving your @Stanford email, as well as disconnecting in-room network connections and optional services such as Cable TV.\n\nStanford SUNet IDs\n\nWhen you started at Stanford you received a SUNet ID account to gain access to @Stanford email and other online services. Your access to most services will end after you graduate, at the expiration of a 120 day grace period.\n\nSee the Closing your SUNet ID Account web page for details.\n\nUpdate your email\n\nSet up a permanent email address\n\n120 days after you graduate, your account will change to a base level account. This base level account is good for five years, giving you access to your transcripts and other online information, but not to @stanford.edu email.\n\nThe Stanford Alumni Association provides free and permanent email accounts to graduating seniors or students who have spent three quarters or more in a degree-granting program. You do not need to be an alumni association member to get a free alumni email account. You select your name@alumni.stanford.edu username at sign up. It is a professional, Stanford-branded email address that stays with you for life. You can use it on your resume and as the permanent address where you forward your @Stanford email at graduation.\n\nIf you create your alumni account prior to the end of the 120 day grace period, new email sent to your @stanford.edu address after it closes will automatically forward to your @alumni.stanford.edu address for two years. We recommend that you use your alumni email address with friends because this address is permanent.\n\nTo learn more and sign up, visit the Stanford Alumni Email Account web page.\n\nFor instructions on moving your student @stanford.edu Gmail and data to your alumni account, see Migrate Your Student Email to Your Alumni Account and Back Up Your Student G Suite Data.\n\nTransfer or forward your email\n\nForward your @stanford.edu email to another permanent email address (e.g., a Stanford Alumni, Yahoo!, or Hotmail account).\n\nLog into StanfordYou, and select Change settings for account.\n\nIn the Forward email to another address section, click Change.\n\nEnter the email address(es) to which you want your @stanford.edu mail forwarded. Forwarding will end at the same time your email service ends, unless you create an alumni account prior to the end of the 120 day grace period.\n\nSet an autoreply message to inform senders of your new email address.\n\nLog into StanfordYou, and select Change settings for account.\n\nIn the Vacation autoreply section, click Change.\n\nSet the autoreply status to ON, and write a message that includes your new email address. You do not need to set an expiration date, as the autoreply will end at the same time your email service ends.\n\nSave your stored email\n\nIf you use POP, your email is already saved on your computer; no further action is required.\n\nIf you use IMAP, be sure that your email and attachments are cached on your machine. To check this, set your email client to work offline and then make sure you can still get to all your email and attachments. If you can't see your messages and attachments offline, refer to your email program's documentation for how to change the caching setting.\n\nIf you use POP to your AFS space (mutt or Alpine), your email is stored in the /Mail folder there. Use OpenAFS to mount your home folder, then either use a desktop email client (e.g., Apple Mail or Outlook) to import the email from the /Mail folder, or just copy the files to your local computer's hard drive.\n\nIf you use Webmail, you will have to install a desktop client (e.g., Apple Mail or Thunderbird) and use POP to download all your email to your local computer's hard drive. See Configuring Your Email for instructions on how set up your email client.\n\nMove your files from your AFS space\n\nUse OpenAFS for Stanford to mount your home folder, and copy the files from your home folder to your hard drive. If you don't have OpenAFS installed, use an SFTP client such as SecureFX (Windows) or Fetch(Mac) to transfer the files.\n\nClose your AFS website\n\nIf you've put a personal web site at your www.stanford.edu/~sunetid address, you may want to use the grace period to redirect people to another web site. You can do this just by placing a link to your new site on your Stanford site's home page, or by using this <head> tag:\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"5;URL=https://www.mynewsite.com\">\n\nThis will cause most browsers to automatically display the specified URL after a delay of 5 seconds (or any number of seconds you specify).\n\nYour website files are stored in the /WWW folder of your AFS home folder. Use OpenAFS for Stanford to mount your home folder, and copy the files from your home folder to your hard drive. If you don't have OpenAFS installed, use an SFTP client such as SecureFX (Windows) or Fetch (Mac) to transfer the files.\n\nIf you have questions, please submit a Help ticket.\n\nClose your Stanford Sites website\n\nTo remove your personal website at people.stanford.edu/sunetid, submit a Help ticket. You have the option of requesting an offline archive of your website.\n\nDisconnect your in-room network connection\n\nRemember to disconnect your in-room network connection. While it may take a day or two for your RCC to process your disconnect request, it could be processed more quickly, so we recommend that this be the last thing you do before you are ready to pack up your computer and move out.\n\nDisconnect your optional cable TV subscription services"
