        "text": "What you need to know about the upcoming changes at Gmail and Yahoo so you can be ready for February 2024\n\nUpdates from Gmail and Yahoo have been shared and released on their respective sites. We're also tracking them in our Updates to Gmail & Yahoo's Sender Guidelines.\n\nOn October 3rd, Gmail released a statement on their blog summarizing upcoming new requirements for senders as well as why they are rolling these out. At the same time, Yahoo released a statement on their blog summarizing a near identical position around what they expect from senders.\n\nWhat Are the New Requirements?\n\nBoth Gmail and Yahoo are focused on three major areas that can help reduce the amount of spam reaching their customer’s inbox: authentication, complaints, and unsubscribes. They are jointly promoting the minimum standards senders must follow come 2024. The requirements detailed below, lay the groundwork for a safer email environment.\n\nBecause most B2C mailers’ audience sits with Gmail and Yahoo (anywhere from 40% up to 90% of their list, in some cases), non-compliance could sink a program. Best practices are no longer recommendations that one should follow, but are recommendations one must follow.\n\nSo let's dive into what you need to know/do for each of the three areas.\n\nAuthentication Requirements\n\nFor all senders, SPF and DKIM must be configured. By requiring both, it helps to fight abuse coming from bad actors honing in on the gaps in SPF and DKIM. Requiring both also lays the foundation to start implementing DMARC.\n\nMost reputable ESPs offer the ability to create a DKIM key with your visible sending domain, even if the SPF domain is controlled by the ESP. However, not all ESPs require a branded DKIM. Many have a default DKIM domain that they’ll use to sign your mail, to help improve deliverability even if you’re not prepared to full configure your custom domain. This was “good enough” in the past, but likely won’t cut the mustard in 2024.\n\nWhat does that mean for you? Check your email headers to see what authentication you are using and which domains are behind it. If your domains aren't used in SPF and DKIM, reach out to your ESP today to determine next steps. We are coming into a big send season so if you are going to change anything, also ask your ESP if there is a way you can slowly introduce the changes or if it would be better for you to wait.\n\nFor bulk senders sending over 5,000 messages a day to Gmail, a DMARC record will also be required, which means at least one of the domains authenticating the mail (in SPF or DKIM) has to match the visible from domain your email recipients see. Notably, they don’t specify a required DMARC policy, just that a record be present. Which means that the DMARC record policy can start at “none.”\n\nOn the surface, it may not seem to impact much, but in reality is a very logical starting point. When implementing DMARC policies from a consultative perspective, we never recommend going from nothing to something. We always start with a policy of “none”. Then we monitor DMARC reporting to make sure we identify all legitimate mail streams that need attention. Once they are compliant, we move to enforcement (quarantine or reject).\n\nA reporting address, RUA, is not required. Reporting can be a lot to manage if you are sending the reports to your own domain. It can require an investment to manage the reports or to pay a third party to do so. By not requiring reporting, it eases that burden.\n\nHowever, one of the core features of DMARC is to receive reporting so that you can not only identify abuse, but you can identify streams that are not fully authenticated. If you are a small sender, there are a number of free services out there to monitor DMARC reports, so if you can, go hit them up.\n\nThis is not the end of what’s to come, just the start.\n\nDNS records alone are just one example of more work that needs to be done. DNS alone can create gaps and opportunities for abuse. Think about how many of your DNS records you can identify or go pull a list. Now, which ones are old, but remain, which ones are new, which are correct, which are wrong, which are overly permissive, which ones have no history or purpose, and how many exist that you don't even know about?\n\nBut when you are asking an entire community to change what they’ve been doing for decades, one must take baby steps and start somewhere.\n\n\"Baby steps\" phrase referenced from What About Bob?\n\nEven as February comes and goes, the bare minimum will not stay that way indefinitely. And although some may want to know where the final requirement lies so they can make all the changes today, both Gmail and Yahoo are very in tune with the reality of where the email environment stands.\n\nSudden changes can impact the send infrastructure and performance greatly. The approach to start DMARC with “none” policy and no reporting requirement allows senders to ease their way into best practices.\n\nSide note: all this authentication prep opens up a lot of doors making BIMI and AMP email possible. Woohoo!\n\nSpam Complaint Rate Threshold\n\nSend wanted mail. It’s a 🎶 tale as old as time 🎶. AND is the foundation of sending best practices (once you step outside of the technical best practices.)\n\nTied to complaints is consent, a BIG factor in customer expectations and subsequent reactions. Mailbox providers measure this consent or continual consent to receive mail by how users interact with their inbox and the messages within it. One of the loudest signals, and a negative one at that, is a spam complaint.\n\nIn 2024, this rate will be given a ceiling of 0.3%. Gmail specifically states they want senders less than 0.1%, but as you reach that 0.3%, there will be bigger and badder problems for you. And even if you are below the 0.3%, it doesn’t mean complaint rates below that won’t cause inboxing issues. That is dependent on all the other factors tied to the sender, message, complaints, and actions of others. Think about what is happening to your mail today.\n\nDefining a spam threshold of 0.3% allows for benchmarks to steer clear of and give senders better guidance on when they need to look at their program and make changes. It also gives the mailbox providers a tiered approach to action. Hit threshold 1, you get consequence 1 (like spam folder placement). If that doesn’t stop the complaints and they are elevated to 0.3%, you get a harsher consequence (perhaps blocks or some really severe rate limiting - and Yahoo has been doing this for a long time now).\n\nThese defined thresholds are essentially creating a policy, making it much easier for receivers to implement defensive actions against abuse.\n\nThis threshold is also not one that will likely be a “one strike and you’re out,” unless of course you’re sending something malicious and deserve it. As with most things deliverability related, “it depends” and there is a lot of history and trending to keep in mind.\n\nA sender that is consistently hitting the thresholds is more telling about their activity and intent than one that may hit it once. The resulting actions from spikes in your data aren't just about a single instance (although if it’s bad enough it can be), but what is happening over time.\n\nYou won’t be left in the dark about your complaint rate. Yahoo has a CFL you can sign up for with your DKIM domain. Google Postmaster Tools shows complaint rates for authenticated domains. Tracking this information gives you a good picture of how your program is performing.\n\nWhen you set up your postmaster account at Google, make sure you also get your authenticating domains added so you can see how your domain is performing on the parent level, but also how each subdomain and authentication domain is performing. This will help you to identify which one is problematic, if at all, and needs to be looked at more closely.\n\nDon’t forget to keep an eye on all metrics and how they move and hopefully identify issues before they arise.\n\nOne way to fight complaints is to make it EASY to unsubscribe. Suggestions deliverability experts have given in the past range from adding an unsubscribe link to the top, making the unsubscribe font the same as the body of the email, clarify unsubscribe and preferences AT the point of collection and welcome/COI outreach. AND list-unsubscribe!\n\nThis functionality for list-unsubscribe comes in two RFCs:\n\nList-Unsubscribe utilizing a link and/or mailto\n\nAND an extension to list-unsubscribe\n\nList-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click allowing receivers to offer a one-click option to unsubscribe.\n\nIt’s to be noted that in reading all the information Google provided, this one-click unsubscribe is NOT for the unsubscribe link in the body of the email. The phrasing can be a bit confusing. What you should know is that they are referring to a specific email header defining the unsubscribe functionality they can use with POST commands.\n\nThe one-click feature gives receivers a way to incorporate unsubscribe functionality into their mail user agent (MUA), aka email client or email reading application. This not only gives them ways to better offer subscription management to their customers, but also helps protect sender reputation from spam complaints that false positives as well as more accurately (in an ideal world) determine when a complaint is really a complaint and not an “this is an easy way to delete the message.”\n\nImage source: Get Stuff Done, Yahoo Blog\n\nI’d say the biggest note in the announcements is the requirement that unsubscribes should be processed in 2 days. This is much different than the CAN-SPAM requirement of 10 days. It goes above and beyond the legal requirements.\n\nGoing above and beyond is the intent here and has been for a long time. If you read Best Practices from 10+ years ago, they recommend actions that go beyond the bare minimum. One example is the push for opt-in when CAN-SPAM doesn’t require it and the push for authentication when the SMTP protocol doesn’t require it.\n\nIf it weren’t for the bad guys or those taking advantage of the SMTP protocol and the end user, these next steps wouldn’t be needed. Consider speed bumps around school zones. Most may follow the lower speed limit, but for those speed demons, the speed bumps help to force everyone to remain in compliance.\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nNothing.\n\nThe email standards that are being “enforced” have been there all along. Unfortunately, despite the age of these standards and the years (decades???) of sharing best practices on their postmaster sites and sender guidelines, there are still a LOT of senders not adhering to them, intentional or not.\n\nThe status quo is not moving the needle. Even other soft attempts to move the needle with authentication, BIMI for example, didn't work. By implementing enforcement strategies that will either reject mail or place it right in the spam folder, an incentive is created to get senders into compliance with best practices.\n\nNon-delivered email or email not seen is email not generating revenue, awareness, loyalty, or whatever your goal is. What's a better incentive than $$$?\n\nAs stated already, this is not the end. Good guys love email. They love the reach and impact email has on their program and bottom line. But bad guys also love email. They love how much money it makes them. Nothing will stop the bad guys from pushing their bad-guy mail, but this will make it harder and force them to invest more in their systems in order to get the mail through.\n\nIt will make it easier to spot them. But it may also move the attack vector to have their sights set on account compromise where they can steal the reputation of good senders. Or move them to DKIM replay and other attacks.\n\nProviders need to be extra vigilant about vetting users of their system and monitoring compliance.\n\nSenders need to make sure they protect their accounts with MFA and limit who has access to the send system and their DNS as well as auditing access controls throughout the year.\n\nWant more detail on the “new” requirements? Visit Gmail’s Email sender guidelines page. A quick highlight of the requirements pasted directly from Gmail’s page are below. There are three extra requirements for bulk senders sending to over 5,000 recipients in addition to the authentication requirement which requires both SPF AND DKIM. Requirements for bulk senders are are bolded below.\n\nSet up SPF or DKIM email authentication for your domain.\n\nSet up SPF and DKIM email authentication for your domain.\n\nEnsure that sending domains or IPs have valid forward and reverse DNS records, also referred to as PTR records. Learn more\n\nKeep spam rates reported in Postmaster Tools below 0.3%. Learn more\n\nFormat messages according to the Internet Message Format standard (RFC 5322).\n\nDon’t impersonate Gmail From: headers. Gmail will begin using a DMARC quarantine enforcement policy, and impersonating Gmail From: headers might impact your email delivery.\n\nIf you regularly forward email, including using mailing lists or inbound gateways, add ARC headers to outgoing email. ARC headers indicate the message was forwarded and identify you as the forwarder. Mailing list senders should also add a List-id: header, which specifies the mailing list, to outgoing messages.\n\nSet up DMARC email authentication for your sending domain. Your DMARC enforcement policy can be set to none. Learn more\n\nFor direct mail, the domain in the sender's From: header must be aligned with either the SPF domain or the DKIM domain. This is required to pass DMARC alignment.\n\nFor subscribed messages, enable one-click unsubscribe and include a clearly visible unsubscribe link in the message body. Learn more\n\nAnd here’s Yahoo’s Sender Best Practices.\n\nWhat Else?\n\nIt’s highly likely Gmail and Yahoo will not be the only ones laying out stricter requirements. A number of providers in Germany have already implemented stricter requirements around naming conventions and consent. However, these joint statements are laying the groundwork for all providers and senders to create an email environment better equipped to identify and fight spam.\n\nNeed Help?\n\nThis may all seem like a lot AND it may seem very rushed knowing we are starting to step into the thick of peak season. However, as stated before, Yahoo and Gmail are very much aware of the current state of affairs.\n\nI take note that Gmail is phrasing the rollout as “starting,” which to me means that come February, Gmail won’t just throw up a big wall that senders still working to become compliant will hit and flounder. But, instead you may start to see issues and those issues will continue to grow if changes aren’t made. Yahoo has also stated Q1 giving a little more flexibility to the rollout.\n\nDon’t forget, you are not alone! There are many resources out there giving additional information and more will come.\n\nWe are here to help. Please reach out with questions or if you want support implementing some of these changes, reach out to our consulting team.\n\nAnd when you get frustrated, remember you can blame the bad guys! Spammers ruin everything.\n\nOther Reading\n\nSpam Resource\n\nWord to the Wise\n\nEmail Karma\n\nValimail"
