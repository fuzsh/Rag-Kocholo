Presented by Akshai Sarma (Principal Software Engineer, Verizon Media) and Nathan Speidel (Software Engineer, Verizon Media). Bullet is a lightweight, scalable open source multitenant query system that lets you query any data flowing through a streaming system without having to store it. Bullet can run arbitrary queries against an unbounded set of data that arrives after the query is submitted; Bullet queries look forward in time. These queries can filter, project, and aggregate data in transit. Bullet is also platform and framework agnostic. Almost all the layers in Bullet can be mixed and matched with different implementations using core abstractions such as Storm and Spark for the backend layer, Kafka or another messaging queue for the pub/sub layer, and so on.
