        "text": "If yours is a smart nonprofit and you put your digital focus on email marketing, buckle up because changes are on the horizon from Google and Yahoo, and we‚Äôve got the scoop. It‚Äôs estimated that Gmail and Yahoo represent 32.2% of all emails opened. Your numbers may be higher. Within my clients‚Äô email lists, I typically find that Gmail and Yahoo users represent at least 50% of all emails on a list.\n\nStarting in February 2024, Google and Yahoo are throwing down three rules you need to know:\n\nAuthenticated Email Domains: Make sure your emails come from legit sources.\n\nEasy-to-Unsubscribe Links: Let users bail with one click, and make it happen within two days.\n\nKeep Spam Rates Under 0.3%: Don‚Äôt be the annoying spammer in people‚Äôs inboxes.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm using platforms like Bloomerang, My Emma, HubSpot, Constant Contact, or MailChimp?‚Äù Good news! You‚Äôre probably in the clear because these platforms are likely already on the compliance train. But, do double-check with your email service provider just to be sure. They probably already have your back.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk about spam rates ‚Äì the real sticky wicket. If you‚Äôre bombarding inboxes without people‚Äôs permission (always a no-no), watch out! High spam rates are like waving a red flag at Google and Yahoo. They‚Äôre on a mission to cut down on spam, phishing, and all those nasty emails. So, be cautious, and check your spam rates.\n\nWondering why Google and Yahoo are shaking things up? They want to make email safer and more reliable for users. These rules are their way of making best practices mandatory ‚Äì no more optional stuff.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the kicker: If you don‚Äôt play by the rules, your organization might end up in Google or Yahoo email ‚Äújail.‚Äù Translation: Your emails get blocked, and there‚Äôs no easy way out.\n\nWho‚Äôs most likely to be affected? Big senders ‚Äì organizations firing off 5,000+ emails a day. Also, those heavy on transactional emails, folks who haven‚Äôt authenticated their domains, list buyers, and anyone with a spammy reputation.\n\nNow, don‚Äôt freak out! Take precautions. Work with your IT wizards to ensure compliance. Consider creating email subdomains to protect your main domain. Clean up that email list. And keep an eye on your spam rates.\n\nRemember, these rules are here to help us all send better emails, protect our organizations, and make our email experience awesome. So, embrace the change, write killer content, and let‚Äôs keep those inboxes happy! üöÄ"
