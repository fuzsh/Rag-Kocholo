        "text": "This question originally appeared on Quora: Is working at Yahoo as a software engineer (new grad) a career-killing job?\n\nAnswer by Andy Manoske, Senior Product Manager at AlienVault, on Quora\n\nShort answer: Hell no, it's not.\n\nLong answer: As a young CS/Econ grad I had, probably like you, a similar choice: do I go into a startup or do I go into an established company (like Yahoo).\n\nMy startup I was blessed to be approached by was Palantir, which is a fantastic company and admittedly at the time would have given me some crazy equity.\n\nMy established company was NetApp, which, for a 22 year old five years ago, was a lot less sexy but had a management team who knew who I was and was dedicated to helping me and my generation of new college grads succeed.\n\nFrom my friends who ended up becoming early engineers at Palantir, it's clear that there were some awesome wild times that I missed. But at NetApp I learned a lot. Things like:\n\nWhat it's like to work on as a dev - and later manage as a PM - a big product.\n\nHow small decisions when you're at an earlier stage in your company impact you 2, 5, and even 10 years later.\n\nThe beginnings of how to manage people.\n\nHow you convert academic economics to business strategy and execution.\n\nWhat not to do in N-number of different parts of working in high tech.\n\nDomain expertise in storage and IT (which were then unsexy but are now super sexy after being rebranded \"infrastructure\")\n\nAnd while Palantir was/is an awesome place, these are things that I was uniquely able to learn because I worked in product at a company like NetApp.\n\nYahoo! was one of our biggest customers at NetApp, and I had a good chance to spend some time talking with their team (plus they're down the street and we would all frequently clog into this bagel place off of Java).\n\nRegardless of the companies issues, I was, and continue to be, impressed by the quality of technical talent there. There's a ton of opportunities there to learn what works, what doesn't, and build a foundation for starting your career in high tech.\n\nAnd therein lies the most important question out of all of this: your first job isn't your career, it's your foundation. It's the \"freshman year\" of your career, where you start to learn the fundamentals shared by all engineering organizations and the lessons about what works and what doesn't. Those lessons are critical and will serve you long after Yahoo! as a brand name fades into history.\n\nYou could end up being a lifer at Yahoo!, but more likely than not you'll eventually go somewhere else. And being at Yahoo! can give you the skills and lessons to be even more effective in your next role, and learn so while uniquely being in an environment where you have a profundity of resources (as opposed to a startup which is frequently the opposite situation).\n\nHonestly, it doesn't matter whether you kick off your career at Yahoo! or somewhere like Uber. Brand name is nice, but secondary to your skillset and personal drive to succeed.\n\nWhat really matters is the team. Which is the company that best enables you succeed? Which has the best people that you're going to enjoy working with - people hopefully with a diversity of thought and personality such that you grow as a person as well as on your LinkedIn. Which company has management who cares about your success and will advocate and enable you to succeed?\n\nCase in point: while Palantir was way sexier, the fact that the CTO and CEO of NetApp knew me and helped guide me in the first steps of my career was absolutely invaluable. I also had a fantastic set of managers, all of whom taught me a lot about what it takes to succeed in a company like NetApp / in any company in high tech. And my fellow New College Grads and interns were awesome, and left me with a lot of friendships that have lasted long after we all left and will continue to last into the future.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the first post-graduation experience you have on your LinkedIn says \"Yahoo!\" or \"Google.\" What matters is whether you have the people around you at your first company who will teach you the foundations of software engineering, and be advocates for your success.\n\nAlso there used to be a bunch of coffee shop/Starbucks things inside the Yahoo! headquarters back in the day. If those are still there, +5 points for awesomeness.\n\nIs working at Yahoo as a software engineer (new grad) a career-killing job?: originally appeared on Quora: The best answer to any question.
