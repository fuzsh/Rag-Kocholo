Please write a comparison/contrast essay of 1000 words or more discussing the questions below. Remember to begin your paper with an engaging introduction and clear thesis statement, develop each point in the body of your paper using examples and quotes from the stories, and conclude your paper with a restatement of your thesis and closing remarks. Also, be sure to maintain your credibility by including in-text citations and a reference list correctly formatted in APA style. Setting: Describe the settings of both pieces and identify how the eras in which they take place—with their distinct societal attitudes and customs—affect the main characters? Characters: “Battle Royal:” Discuss the young man and his grandfather. Why do we never learn the young man’s name? What do the grandfather’s dying words reveal about him? “The Birthmark:” Describe the main characters: Aylmer, Georgiana and Aminadab. What is important to each? Point of View: In which point of view (first- or third-person) is each piece told? If the point of view in “Battle Royal” was changed, would it have made the story more effective, or less so? Symbolism: “Battle Royal:” Analyze the deeper meaning of the following: the “battle royal” itself, the naked blonde, and the young man’s dream at the end of the story. “The Birthmark:” What does Georgiana’s birthmark signify, first to her and then to Aylmer? What does alchemy represent in the story? Themes: What are the main themes/messages of each piece? What, in other words, do you think the authors, Ralph Ellison and Nathaniel Hawthorne, are trying to communicate about life and human nature in their respective stories? Fear: What role does fear play in both pieces? Discrimination: Both stories address physical appearance, specifically one’s skin, and the way people may discriminate against others because of external characteristics they deem inferior. Compare and contrast how discrimination and prejudice are presented in “Battle Royal” and “The Birthmark.” Final Thoughts: Author Tim O’Brien wrote, \"That's what fiction is for. It's for getting at the truth when the truth isn't sufficient for the truth.\" Talk about how literature might give us “truer” insights into the human experience by appealing to our senses, emotions and empathy. Describe a situation in which you or someone you know may have been discriminated against because of appearance, gender, race or another attribute. What did the experience teach you? .\n\nThis module’s assignment has two parts.Part 1 Social media is b.docx\n\nThis module’s assignment has two parts.Part 1 Social media is b.docxdivinapavey\n\nThis module’s assignment has two parts. Part 1: Social media is being used more today than ever to share with friends and family. This leads investigators to look to social media for clues about a subject or the activity. For this module, research ways social media can be used for investigations on the criminal, as well as the civil side, and answer the following: What situations would social media be helpful in the investigation? What are the methods that would be needed to preserve the evidence? What would be the process for obtaining the evidence from the provider? Part 2: As a forensic analyst, you have been asked by the investigator to investigate an email that is subject to an investigation. Using the attached files, complete a thorough analysis of the email and headers. The investigator also wants to know as much as you can find about the person who supposedly sent the email and if there’s any presence on social media. Provide a written formal report from the scenario and questions above. Support your report with the sources used. Use the following for citing sources and document it uses APA (American Psychological Association) style for the sourcing information (References) in the body. 500 words .\n\nThis is Ethics in Criminal Justice Practice class.There are tw.docx\n\nThis is Ethics in Criminal Justice Practice class.There are tw.docxdivinapavey\n\nThis is Ethics in Criminal Justice Practice class. There are two essays that are required for this course. Essay #1 “In the book’s final quote, why do you believe he says it takes “strength and grace” to make choices in life, rather than simply making ethical decisions?” Note: Use the format that is provided in the essay folder on the Black Board. Due Date Wednesday, June 3, 2015 11:59 PM + Essay #2 “Minority Report Steven Spielberg, Director (2002) Minority Report is set in the year 2054, and John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief of the Department of Pre-Crime in Washington, D.C. There has not been a murder there in 6 years, because of an operation Anderton supervises where three pre-cognitive humans (“pre-cogs”) drift in a flotation tank and have their brain waves tapped by computers. These brain waves can pick up thoughts of premeditated murders, so the police can be warned and arrest the would-be perpetrators before they can kill (hence the “Department of Pre-Crime”). Of course, it is not as easy as this, because the pre-cogs can provide only the time and date of the murder, the murderer’s name, and the victim’s name—the other facts can be learned only by clues derived from the various images generated by the pre-cogs around the time of murder. The film is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick. The pre-crime police strategy is going to expand nationwide, and there is personal and bureaucratic jealousy toward Anderton and the pre-crime unit. The movie focuses on a rare disagreement among the “pre-cogs” over a pending murder, and one of the pre- cogs apparently files a minority report disagreeing with the others. Normally, the minority report is disregarded, but the twist is that Anderton himself becomes a target for arrest as a predicted killer, and he is apparently warned of this by one of the pre- cogs. Anderton then is chased by police, assisted by one of the pre-cogs named Agatha (Samatha Morton), and the futuristic police pursuit and search is interesting and compelling. For example, everyone is subject to retina scans, so Anderton has to get an eye transplant to hide his identity while being pursued. The story has several twists, and it raises important issues about the certainty of knowledge and how knowledge should be used. QUESTIONS 1. If we were able to predict premeditated murders in the future by somehow scanning the minds of citizens, is this enough evidence to apprehend and take legal action against them? What would the major ethical perspectives say? 2. The accurate prediction of criminal behavior is not yet possible, but profiles are sometimes used by police for targeting suspects. Under what circumstances is the use of a profile to take police action morally permissible?

Kennedy speaking on t.docx\n\nThis is the speech you will watch Robert F. Kennedy speaking on t.docxdivinapavey\n\nThis is the speech you will watch: Robert F. Kennedy speaking on the night Martin Luther King was assassinated. The short speech you will view was delivered on the evening of April 4th, 1968, by Robert F. Kennedy. You may view it as many times as you like, and even reference it as you answer the following questions. Please upload your work as a Word document you upload when you are done. Be sure to save your Word document to your computer in the event that any technical problems arise. Also, do not attempt to upload your work at the very last moment this is open. Be prepared well before the submission deadline. I will not accept any of this late for any reason. Questions that reference \"our book\" are directed at our class textbook, Invitation to Public Speaking by Cindy L. Griffin. A) In announcing to his audience the assassination earlier that day of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Sen. Kennedy had some ethical issues to consider. Please refer to pages 3 and 4 of our book, and chapter 1 more broadly, and any notes or class Power Points, to answer the following: Question A1 : In what way do you see and hear Sen. Kennedy acting ethically as a public speaker? In other words, how was his speech the kind of public dialogue our book defines as an \"ethical and civil exchange of ideas and opinions among communities about topics that affect the public?\" Question A2: Among the members of the audience assembled to hear Sen. Kennedy speak were whites and blacks. In a sense, the \"community\" of his audience was also two communities. How does Sen. Kennedy address the concerns and feelings of blacks during his speech? How was he, as an ethical speaker, audience centered? He does something very specific to connect with the black members of his audience grieving the death of Dr. King. What is it? Question A3: Sen. Kennedy's speech was praised and cited as the reason there was no rioting in Indianapolis that evening. How might a less ethical speaker have spoken in a way that incited violence or even hate? B) In chapter 3 of our book, Griffin discusses the general and specific purposes to public speeches, and also talks about thesis statements. Consider this information as you answer the following questions: Question B1) Listen to Robert Kennedy's speech and discuss what you think was his general purpose, specific purpose and (though he never says it in so many words) his thesis. C) Sen. Kennedy was a prominent son from a prominent white family endowed with wealth and privilege and power. Others with this identity as their master statuses (defined in chapter 4) have been and are ethnocentric in their standpoints. Answer the following: Question C1) What evidence do you have from this speech about Robert Kennedy's standpoint? How would you describe his standpoint? Is it ethnocentric? D) Chapter 8 offers ideas for using quotations and even poetry in introductions and conclusions. Answer: Question D1 ) When/where did Robert Kennedy use poetry and/or quotatio.\n\nA beginner’s guide to project reviews - everything you wanted to know but wer...\n\nA beginner’s guide to project reviews - everything you wanted to know but wer...Association for Project Management\n\nAPM event held on 9 July in Bristol. Speaker: Roy Millard The SWWE Regional Network were very pleased to welcome back to Bristol Roy Millard, of APM’s Assurance Interest Group on 9 July 2024, to talk about project reviews and hopefully answer all your questions. Roy outlined his extensive career and his experience in setting up the APM’s Assurance Specific Interest Group, as they were known then. Using Mentimeter, he asked a number of questions of the audience about their experience of project reviews and what they wanted to know. Roy discussed what a project review was and examined a number of definitions, including APM’s Bok: “Project reviews take place throughout the project life cycle to check the likely or actual achievement of the objectives specified in the project management plan” Why do we do project reviews? Different stakeholders will have different views about this, but usually it is about providing confidence that the project will deliver the expected outputs and benefits, that it is under control. There are many types of project reviews, including peer reviews, internal audit, National Audit Office, IPA, etc. Roy discussed the principles behind the Three Lines of Defence Model:, First line looks at management controls, policies, procedures, Second line at compliance, such as Gate reviews, QA, to check that controls are being followed, and third Line is independent external reviews for the organisations Board, such as Internal Audit or NAO audit. Factors which affect project reviews include the scope, level of independence, customer of the review, team composition and time. Project Audits are a special type of project review. They are generally more independent, formal with clear processes and audit trails, with a greater emphasis on compliance. Project reviews are generally more flexible and informal, but should be evidence based and have some level of independence. Roy looked at 2 examples of where reviews went wrong, London Underground Sub-Surface Upgrade signalling contract, and London’s Garden Bridge. The former had poor 3 lines of defence, no internal audit and weak procurement skills, the latter was a Boris Johnson vanity project with no proper governance due to Johnson’s pressure and interference. Roy discussed the principles of assurance reviews from APM’s Guide to Integrated Assurance (Free to Members), which include: independence, accountability, risk based, and impact, etc Human factors are important in project reviews. The skills and knowledge of the review team, building trust with the project team to avoid defensiveness, body language, and team dynamics, which can only be assessed face to face, active listening, flexibility and objectively.
