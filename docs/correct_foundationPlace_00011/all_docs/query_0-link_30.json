We are especially interested in critical reflection on women's movements that can be viewed as transformative in the sense that they offer radical challenges to existing gender relations, inequalities and injustices. Contributions should add to the documentation on the proliferation and growth of new modes of organising. Feminist activists have responded to the challenges of economic decline, dictatorship, crisis and conflict, and to repressive civil societies in many new and undocumented ways. Current global challenges make it all the more urgent to critically engage with the changing modes of activism. Submissions would include feature articles; review articles; profiles of individuals, events or organisations; opinion pieces, interviews and other short articles. Deadline for abstracts is April 30, 2004.

The major objective of this conference is to start exploring, under the auspices of the IWHA, the potential for a comprehensive project on the history of water on the African continent. It is hoped that the conference would prepare participants who specialize in Africa for the next IWHA Conference in Paris that is scheduled for 2005. All abstracts must be submitted in English as an e-mail attachment. Deadline for abstracts is June 15, 2004.

But if one looks again, it is clear that the issues raised under this rubric have only become more important to the discipline over the last hundred years. In the 2004 Annual Meeting we return to this traditional theme to examine its resonance in a world made newly aware of the limits and dangers of human rationality. Deadline for abstracts is April 1, 2004. For more information: http://www.aaanet.org/mtgs/cfp/pdfs/index.htm\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS: 2ND INTERNATIONAL 'LANGUAGE-COMMUNICATION\n\nCULTURE' CONFERENCE (November 24-27, 2004) in Beja, Portugal, The theme of this conference is \"Knowledge and Power: History, Geography, Representation, Identity in Post-Colonial Studies.\" In Orientalism, Edward Said selected these two great Baconian themes - Knowledge and Power - as dominant in the discourse of imperial authority. And, in Culture and Imperialism, he called for 'a different and innovative paradigm for humanistic research', 'a way of regarding our world as amenable to investigation and interrogation without magic keys, special jargons and instruments, curtained-off practices.' Both in method and content Said's books contributed to a new approach to post-colonial theory and practice. A year after his death we would like to address some of the issues he developed in his work. Papers on the following subjects are welcome: 1) Histories of Empires and Colonies; Women and Empires; Old Empires and Indirect Colonialism; Post-colonial Theories in the 21st century; Said's works and their importance in post-colonial cultural criticism. Please send 150-word abstracts by July 15, 2004 to the following addresses: Adelaide Meira Serras (aserras@mail.telepac.pt), Luí Leal de Faria (lealfaria@yahoo.com) or Teresa Malafaia (tvmalafaia@mail.telepac.pt)\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS: CONFLICT RESEARCH GROUP, 'GRASSROOTS\n\nPERSPECTIVES ON THE DRC CONFLICT' (May 26-28, 2004) in Ghent, Belgium The seminar will be hosted by the Centre for Third World Studies at the University of Ghent. The purpose of this seminar is to take on the double issue of war and transition in the DRC to initiate an academic discussion on grassroots dynamics of violence and war, and on local processes of conflict-resolution. On the one hand, the organizers want to develop an interdisciplinary dialogue between the different field specialists and scholars that are active in the area of conflict analysis, social anthropology and international relations dealing with \"grassroots\" impacts of the DRC-conflict on a political, socio-economic and socio-cultural level. On the other hand, this seminar intends to combine thorough field research with broader theoretical discussions on violent economic and social transformation in a context of decreasing statehood in Africa. The deadline abstracts is April 15, 2004.For more information contact Tim Raeymaekers (timraey@eudoramail.com) or Koen Vlassenroot (koen.vlassenroot@Ugent.be)\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS: TWO-DAY SEMINAR ON \"HOW GREEN WAS OUR\n\nEMPIRE?

At the same time, religion has continued to impact on transitioning West African societies in many ways. In these societies, the influence of religion can be observed across many social geographies- in higher institutions, corporate organizations, official institutions; in short, every social interstice where religion is theoretically expected to be 'noticed' by its absence. This process, what we might call the enchantment of the public realm, has had profound consequences for traditional divisions between the public and the private spheres. We invite contributions from across disciplines and methodologies which balance the theoretical and the empirical, rethinking these issues in innovative and challenging ways. Authors are encouraged to pay special attention to the ways in which new religious movements question the legitimacy of the state, the role of alienated youth in the formation of these movements, the surge of fundamentalisms across the sub-region, and how ordinary people are using religion to re-negotiate the existing terms of citizenship, engage with or subvert the state. Papers are due by July 30, 2004.
