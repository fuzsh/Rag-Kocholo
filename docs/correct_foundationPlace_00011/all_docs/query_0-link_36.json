        "text": "Welcome to the Book of Abstracts for the 2018 SPARC conference. This year we not only celebrate the work of our PGRs but also the launch of our Doctoral School, which makes this year’s conference extra special. Once again we have received a tremendous contribution from our postgraduate research community; with over 100 presenters, the conference truly showcases a vibrant PGR community at Salford. These abstracts provide a taster of the research strengths of their works, and provide delegates with a reference point for networking and initiating critical debate. With such wide-ranging topics being showcased, we encourage you to take up this great opportunity to engage with researchers working in different subject areas from your own. To meet global challenges, high impact research inevitably requires interdisciplinary collaboration. This is recognised by all major research funders. Therefore engaging with the work of others and forging collaborations across subject areas is an essenti...\n\nAlignment to the sustainable Development Goals (SDGS), that are cascaded down to Agenda 2063, the New Urban Agenda (UN HABITAT III, Quito 2016), GoK vision 2030 and NACRA 2020-24, in learning and research that is represented in this ensemble of inquiry provides suitable local and global anchorage to pertinent, current developmental themes. The inquiry that is featured here interrogates the subject area of environmental planning and provides novel solutions along diverse themes and sub-themes emanating from SDGs 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11,13, and 15 and their equivalents in the Agenda 2063. The endeavour to develop knowledge at a doctoral level examines prevailing reality for SDGs 9 & 11, in the context of facilitating sustainable and resilient infrastructure development and supporting domestic technology development, research, and innovation.; access to natural and contrived green spaces; urban resilience and sustainability; sustainable transport planning; conservation of heritage and cultural identity; and sustainable cities and human settlements. At the master’s degree level inquiry embraces SDG 6 & 11 pursuing knowledge in respect of climate change and population growth impacts on access to quality drinking water; and inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. The undergraduate level in its turn contemplates the local context and its theoretical underpinnings within SDGs 2, 3, 4, 11, 13 & 15 and their equivalents in the Agenda 2063, along the themes of, Zero hunger, health and population; inclusive education; safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements; urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts; and sustainable management of forests-combating desertification-reversing land degradation-and halting biodiversity loss. Research that is presented here is anchored on the intensified application of the Science, Technology, and innovation (STI), a foundation that is designed to raise productivity and efficiency across all three pillars (economy, society & governance – politics) of Kenya’s vision 2030. It provides proceeds of research for development that can accelerate economic development of a newly industrialising nation, Kenya. The research work specifically aligns to the social pillar of Kenya’s Vision 2030. This pillar seeks to attain a just and cohesive society, enjoying equitable social development in a clean and secure environment. It’s intentions are variously addressed in research here as articulated in a social strategy that purposes to invest in the people of Kenya through the diverse goals of (1) education & training; (2) an efficient and high-quality health care system; (3) conservation and management and improved access to safe water and sanitation; (4) a clean secure and sustainable environment; (5) adequate, decent and high quality urban livelihoods; (6) and finally equality of opportunity in accessing public services and providing income generating activities in a drive to achieve equity and poverty elimination. Research here also embraces research in the key technical disciplines of the National Construction Research Agenda (NACRA). These include (1) construction technology and materials; (2) capacity development; (3) construction management; (4) risk and safety management; (5) Environment; (6) construction economics; (7) legal and regulatory framework; and (8) governance."
