        "text": "March 29, 2012 – The OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan (OSMFJ) and The OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) announce the release of a new OpenStreetMap layer for Yahoo!JAPAN map services. The new OSM layer is available on Yahoo! JAPAN Local (see the map here)\n\n2011 Yahoo! JAPAN data donation\n\nOn March 6th, 2011, Yahoo! JAPAN handed over nation-wide map data to OSMF Japan. The data was originally owned by ALPS corporation, which merged with Yahoo!JAPAN. The OSM community got permission to import and use this data.\n\nNote that the Yahoo! JAPAN ALPS data is not the map data used by Yahoo.com or Yahoo.co.jp. The maps at Yahoo.com and Yahoo.co.jp are not permitted for use by OSM (see the ‘YahooJapanALPS Data’ wiki page).\n\nMobile maps\n\nThe new OSM layer is also available for Yahoo! JAPAN Local mobile. OSM with its frequently updated data is very useful for many map users.\n\nAbout OpenStreetMap Foundation\n\nThe OpenStreetMap Foundation is a UK-registered not-for-profit organization that supports the OpenStreetMap Project. The OpenStreetMap Project based at OpenStreetMap.org, is the worldwide mapping effort that includes more than 500,000 volunteers around the globe. The foundation consists of members from around the world who elect its board of directors. Much of the foundation’s extensive work is done in the background, yet is critical to the ongoing functioning and growth of the OpenStreetMap Project.\n\nAbout OSM Foundation Japan\n\nThe OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan (OSMF Japan) is an organisation that performs fundraising and supports the Japanese community; it does not control the project or “own” the OSM data. It is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and to providing geospatial data for anybody to use and share.\n\nhttp://www.osmf.jp/news/pressrelease20120329"
