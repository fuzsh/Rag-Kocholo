        "text": "Hi All, this could be a Tracking Protection block if Yahoo hosts its comments with a third party that does the same for multiple sites (the third party can engage in cross-site tracking). As a test, turn off Tracking Protection on Yahoo! News. Obviously not ideal because you'll probably see even more ads, but please test and see whether that allows comments to load. To do that, click the shield icon at the left end of the address bar (next to the lock) and click the slider switch to turn off tracking protection. Any difference?\n\nThank you for testing that. You might be able to make a more precise exception just for the commenting site. This thread has an example of how people were setting that up for Disqus, but I don't know whether Yahoo uses Disqus:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1cs30e1/openweb_discussion_not_displaying_in_firefox/\n\nWait! That only worked once. However, on the page it wouldn't let me enter a comment, \"failed to publish.\" When I closed the browser and opened a new one, it shows the shield with a line across it, indicating protection is off, but the comments only show up half the time and I still can't post.\n\nAny additional things to try?\n\nI looked at a new story, and the comments are in a frame on this URL:\n\nhttps://openweb.jac.yahoosandbox.com/2.0.0/safeframe.html\n\nIf I click \"Log in\" it takes me to a Yahoo! login page. So it seems I can't test without diving in more deeply than I have time for at the moment.\n\nI have this same problem on Safari. However, I have recently found a workaround. If I get a \"View Comments\" link with no number for the comments, when I click on it, it just disappears. However, I find that if I go to the right of the screen, there is an ad with an 'X'. If I click on the 'X', it goes back to the previous screen. Now if I click on that same story, it loads with the comments accessible.\n\n@ja7 wrote:\n\nHello jscher I don't find the shield. I am on a Macbook air using safari\n\nNormally it is just to the left of the lock icon. I can't think of a reason for it to be completely missing. Is it only missing on Yahoo?\n\nYeah. Yahoo keeps changing their format. When they go back to the old style pages, everything works fine. Now they've gone to this 'New Look' and the Comments sections don't show up again.\n\nNot sure what the problem is. It's only happening on my android tablet, not my android phone or my windows laptop. Things have been really weird this week, it's like AI has been given full control of everything and it's not doing that great a job.\n\nYahoo not only rejects the majority of the comments I make,...now it's not even opening comment sections. I can't read comments. I can't help but feel like the Ai is trying to discourage my comments all together. I can post an lol with a gif and it gets rejected. Years ago I went to Xitter, formerly known as Twitter, because of Yahoo's comment section. Now Xitter sucks because of Elmo. Sucks when Ai tells you to sit down and STFU."
