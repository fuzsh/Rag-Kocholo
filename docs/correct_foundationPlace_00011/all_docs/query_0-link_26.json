        "text": "As the amount of information in the world is growing very quickly, in the case of the semantic web this increasing amount of information is becoming more difficult to find and manage the exact answers to our various questions. To overcome these difficulties some systems have been developed that make it work for us. But there exists many challenges in developing these systems that require a lot of improvement. In this tutorial, we give a basic understanding of Semantic web, RDF triple, SPARQL query language. Here we will discuss the main obstacles for the QA system in processing the questions and a detailed survey of the existing systems. We also provide some advantages and disadvantages of existing QA systems. We also discuss the evaluation campaigns of the existing models based on their precision, recall and F-1 scores on the QALD dataset.\n\nNatural Language Interfaces are increasingly relevant for information systems fronting rich structured data stores such as RDF and OWL repositories, mainly because of the conception of them being intuitive for human. In the previous work, we developed FREyA, an interactive Natural Language Interface for querying ontologies. It uses syntactic parsing in combination with the ontology-based lookup in order to interpret the question, and involves the user if necessary.\n\nAbstract. Much research has been done to combine the fields of Databases and Natural Language Processing. While many works focus on the problem of deriving a structured query for a given natural language question, the problem of query verbalization–translating a structured query into natural language–is less explored. In this work we describe our approach to verbalizing SPARQL queries in order to create natural language expressions that are readable and understandable by the human day-to-day user.\n\nExecutive Summary This document (LarKC D2. 7.3) provides an overview over ongoing and completed efforts to evaluate data retrieval and selection methods within LarKC. As many of these efforts have been reported in previous project deliverables (eg, D2. 1.1, D2. 1.2, D2. 3.2, D2. 3.3 and D2. 7.2) we will refer to those documents whenever appropriate and only repeat information when it is relevant for the understanding of the present document."
