        "text": "Yahoo’s Valuable 500 Commitment:\n\nDisability inclusion is central to our success at Yahoo. We have a proud 20-year history of advancing the needs of our stakeholders with disabilities and of playing a prominent leadership role in accessible technology and beyond. In support of advocacy work, we donated $5M in media to a number of disability organizations, including the NationalAssociation of the Deaf, the American Council of the Blind, and the American Association of People with Disabilities.At all times, we’re guided by the communities we serve.\n\nWhile we celebrate past achievements, we are excited to continue building an inclusive future for all of our stakeholders: users, employees, shareholders and society. We are committed to advancing the experience of people with both visible and non-visible disabilities and are focused on the following areas:\n\nAccessibility:\n\nIncorporate the latest technology and techniques in accessible design and media, and reshape opportunities for and the perception of people with disabilities.\n\nCreate impact through our Accessibility Council – a company-wide effort to achieve best-in-class status around accessibility and disability inclusion.\n\nRecruiting:\n\nYahoo recruiters participate in a certified disability recruiting training program so they have a foundational understanding of how to best recruit, interview, hire, accommodate and onboard candidates with disabilities.\n\nEnsure Human Resources activities (recruitment, talent acquisition, onboarding, training and accommodations) adhere to industry best practices for inclusion of people with disabilities.\n\nProducts & Content:\n\nIn 2020, Yahoo committed to featuring closed captions on 100% of new user-facing video, including partner content, that is streamed on our own video players going forward.\n\nYahoo Fantasy’s app commits to incorporating the latest accessibility features into its native app and seeking input from blind users throughout the design, development and testing phases.\n\nYahoo will continue to raise awareness of people with disabilities in it’s content and coverage. Most recently,Yahoo Sports debuted a short documentary about it’s All Blind Fantasy Football League — a group of sportsfanatics who use assistive technology like screen readers with the Yahoo Fantasy app so they can experience fantasy in a fully accessible way."
