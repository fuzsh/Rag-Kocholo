        "text": ".\n\n>> Essays and poetry by Ron Price TAGS: Growth; Learning; Ron Price\n\n> add tags\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe building of the community & administrative structure of this new world Faith was at the core of Bahai programs & policies, goals & game-plans, so to speak, from 1921 to 1996, a period of 75 years, and as far back as the last years of the 19th century.\n\nNotes:\n\nPart 1:\n\nThis book, of which this document at BLO is Part A, is 790 pages font 16, and 680 pages font 14. The book has 280 thousand words. It contains reflections and understandings regarding the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning and growth, what amounts to a paradigmatic shift, in the Bahaâi community. This international community found in over 230 countries and territories, as well as an estimated 150 thousand localities, has been going through this shift in its culture since the mid-1990s.\n\nThis Faith had its origins in mid-19th century Iran with a century of several critical precursors going back to the middle of the 18th century. The new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture or paradigm, which is the focus of this book, has just stuck its head above the ground, so to speak. This new culture of learning and growth will be developing in the decades ahead, arguably, at least until 2044, the end of the second century of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Era(1844 to 2044), and perhaps beyond into that third century of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Era, 2044 to 2144. Time will tell when the next paradigmatic shift will take place in the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community, a community I have now been associated with for more than 60 years: 1953 to 2015.\n\nPart 2:\n\nComparisons and contrasts are made to several previous paradigm shifts in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community, as well as the BÃ¡bÃ­ community, the major precursor community out of which the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith emerged by degrees from the 1850s to the 1860s. Thoughts on future developments within this paradigm, and future paradigms, are suggested. In the first nine years, 2007 to 2015, of the presence on the internet of this commentary, this book, it has contributed to an extensive dialogue on the issues regarding the many related and inter-related processes involved in the many ongoing changes since 1996 in the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community and its 5 to 8 million adherents.\n\nThis work is dedicated to the Universal House of Justice, trustee of the global undertaking which the events of more than a century ago set in motion. The fully institutionalized charismatic Force, a Force that historically found its expression in the Person of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h, had effloresced by a process of succession, of appointment and election, at the apex of Bahai administration for half a century by the end of April 2013.\n\nI have also written this book as a form of dedication to, by some accounts, an estimated 20 thousand BahÃ¡'Ã­s and Babis who have given their lives for this Cause from the 1840s to the second decade of this third millennium. I have also dedicated this book to the many best teachers and exemplary believers--those ordinary Bahais--who have consecrated themselves, indeed their lives by sensible and insensible degrees, each in their own ways, to the work of this Faith.\n\nThis book has also been written partly in memory of what has come to be recognized as a large and intrepid band of early BahÃ¡âÃ­ men and women who blazed a trail for those of us who have followed, and the ever-growing, ever-evolving global BahÃ¡âÃ­ community that they helped to âbirth.â\n\nI am also grateful to have been in the warm embrace of many BahÃ¡'Ã­ communities, a heterogeneous mix of people who have often tested me to my limits, and I them, but who taught me a great deal through the chrysalis of social interaction and experience over my more than 60 years of association with this newest, this latest, of the Abrahamic religions. Finally, I have written this work in memory of my maternal grandfather, Alfred Cornfield, whose life from 1872 to 1958 has always been for me a model of an engagement in a quite personal culture of learning and personal growth.\n\nPart 3:\n\nThis book is the longest analysis and commentary on this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm that is currently available in the Bahai community, although several other books, which deal with this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture to some extent, have appeared since this book was first launched in cyberspace in 2007. The overarching perspective in this book is a quite personal one that attempts to answer the question: \"where do I fit into this new paradigm?\" Readers are left to work out their own response to this question, as readers inevitably must, now and in the decades ahead, as this new paradigm develops a life of its own within the framework already established in the first two decades of its operation: 1996 to 2015.\n\nThe question now is not \"if\" but \"how\" each BahÃ¡'Ã­ will engage themselves, will participate, in this new paradigm as the first century of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Formative Age comes to an end in 2021, and as the years beyond in this third millennium continue to challenge all of humanity in ways we can, at this point, only dimly imagine.\n\nReflections on a Culture of Learning and Growth: Community and Individual Paradigm Shifts: Part A:\n\nA Contemporary, Historical, Futuristic and Personal Context\n\nby Ron Price\n\n2008\n\nPREAMBLE #1:\n\nSection 1:\n\nThis book is 790 pages font 16, and 680 pages font 14, in length with 280 thousand words. It is divided into two Parts: Part A which is this document at BahÃ¡'Ã­ Library Online(BLO), and Part B which is also at BLO and can easily be accessed by interested readers by typing the words \"culture of learning\" into the \"Title Search\" box at the top of the access page. It was necessary to divide the book into two Parts after some 15 years in the development of the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm as continuing elucidations and commentaries on its structure and function, an ongoing exegisis, became part of an extensive literature. This division into Parts A and B was also due to the limitations in the size that is allowed for each document at BLO. The book contains reflections and understandings regarding a new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning and growth, what amounts to a paradigmatic shift, in the Bahaâi community. It has been going through this shift since the mid-1990s.\n\nThis newest, this latest, of the Abrahamic religions, has been developing a new culture in the last two decades, from 1996 to 2015. This new culture, or paradigm, will also be developing and refining, expanding and consolidating,in the decades ahead, arguably at least until 2044, the end of the second century of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Era(1844 to 2044), and perhaps beyond into what will be the third century, 2044 to 2144. Time will tell when the next paradigmatic shift will take place in the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community, the second most wide-spread religion on the planet according to several sources.\n\nComparisons and contrasts are made to several previous paradigm shifts in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community, as well as shifts in the nature and definition, the teachings and expression, which the Babi community went through in its short existence of some ten to twenty years. Thoughts on future developments within this paradigm and future paradigms are suggested as the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community evolves in the decades and centuries ahead. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith is, in many ways, a religion with the very future in its bones and tissues, its veins and arteries, its cells and atoms.\n\nIn the years 2007 to 2015 during which this book, this commentary, has been available on the world-wide-web, this work has contributed to an extensive dialogue on the issues regarding the many related and inter-related processes involved in the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm. There have been many changes in the international Bahai community in the last twenty years as this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture has been developing. This community which exists in more than 230 countries & territories, and in a guesstimated 150,000 localities, across the planet is what you might call a very wide church. This is putting the subject somewhat colloquially, though, for the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith hardly resembles a church at all; nor is it a sect or a cult, a branch of an old religion, a denomination or an ism. It does not exist among the dozens of wasms, the dozens of outworn shibboleths that fill the spaces of our planet with their useless weeds, long ago having outlived their use and purpose.\n\nShibboleths are customs, principles, or beliefs that distinguish a particular class or group of people, especially long-standing ones regarded as outmoded and no longer useful to the human race. (Note: the last statistic available on Wikipedia for the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith listed 127,000 localities in 2001. Readers with an interest in statistics will find Wikipedia a helpful source across a range of numerical figures for the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. Since 2001, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has continued to expand; any numerical figures after the turn of the millennium in 2001 are, at best, guestimations on my part, drawing on annual reports of several national BahÃ¡'Ã­ communities, communities which publish their statistics annually. It should be emphasized, though, that this new paradigm has, in its first 20 years, 1996 to 2015, placed far less emphasis on numbers than it did in the previous decades of its expansion, previous decades when I was associated with this new world Faith as far back as the 1950s.\n\nStill, the growth in the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community according to one source, Adherents.com, shows some 6 to 8 million. That site also enumerates the 20 largest national BahÃ¡'Ã­ populations, and the 20 countries with the largest proportion of BahÃ¡'Ã­s. The source given by Adherants.com is for the year 2000. The numbers are \"estimated BahÃ¡'Ã­ statistics from David Barrett, World Christian Encyclopedia, 2000; Total population statistics, mid-2000 from Population Reference Bureau (http://www.prb.org). I have no figures for 2015.\n\nSection 2:\n\nThis work is dedicated to the Universal House of Justice, trustee of the global undertaking which the events of more than a century ago set in motion. The fully institutionalized charismatic Force, a Force that historically found its expression in the Person of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h, had fully effloresced by a process of succession, of appointment and election, at the apex of Bahai administration for half a century by the end of April 2013.\n\nI have also written this book as a form of dedication to, by some accounts, an estimated 20,000 BahÃ¡'Ã­s and Babis who have given their lives for this Cause from the 1840s to the second decade of this third millennium. The religious and cultural meanings of martyrdom & witnessing, and their role in Babi history are found discussed in detail in a thesis submitted for Master of Arts for the Dept. of Religious Studies at the University of Toronto in 1997. I have also dedicated this book to the many best teachers and exemplary believers--those ordinary Bahais--who have consecrated themselves, indeed their lives, to the progress of this Faith.\n\nThis book has also been written for what has come to be recognized as a large and intrepid band of early BahÃ¡âÃ­ men women who blazed a trail for those of us who have followed, and the ever-growing, ever-evolving global BahÃ¡âÃ­ community that they helped to âbirth.â I am grateful to have been in the warm embrace of many BahÃ¡'Ã­ communities over my more than 60 years of association with this newest, this latest, of the Abrahamic religions. I have been tested to my limits more times than I can count, and I know I have also tested the limits of others, both in my family and in many of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ communities with which I have been associated over those 60 and more years. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith is not a tea-party, although there are often times when it seems to resemble a party atmosphere due to the highly social nature of this religion.\n\nFinally, I have written this work in memory of; firstly, my maternal grandfather, Alfred Cornfield, whose life from 1872 to 1958 has always been for me a model within my own family of an engagement in a quite personal culture of learning and personal growth; and secondly, the many others who have been my mentors in life, others whose learning or experience, or both, has been an inspiration from my late teens when I began to read seriously in the social sciences and humanities, and when I began to take part in the community life of a religion which had come into my family's life back in 1953 when I was just nine years old.\n\nSection 3:\n\nTHE BADI CALENDAR\n\nThe letter of the Universal House of Justice dated July 10, 2014, with its attachment about the BahÃ¡âÃ­ calendar, was a great surprise to many of the friends in the BahÃ¡âÃ­ world. To clarify several technical issues involved and to appreciate the timing and understand the implications of this message, this article is offered to the readership of this eminent journal. In this epoch-making message that launches a unified BahÃ¡âÃ­ calendar, the Universal House of Justice pointed out to us: âThe adoption of a new calendar in each dispensation is a symbol of the power of Divine Revelation to reshape human perception of material, social, and spiritual reality. Through it, sacred moments are distinguished, humanityâs place in time and space reimagined, and the rhythm of life recast.â The same message drew attention to the fact that the launching of the new calendar will further âuniteâ the BahÃ¡âÃ­ world. The friends in the West had always known, through books such as God Passes By and The Dawn-Breakers, that many BahÃ¡âÃ­ historical dates were recorded and mentioned based on the lunar calendar of Islam. They had been also aware that a few BahÃ¡âÃ­ anniversaries were being observed in some countries in the Eastin accordance with the lunar calendar, while the rest adhered to the dates of the solar calendar.\n\nTo provide for resolving this disparity, the BahÃ¡âÃ­ texts stipulated that the Universal House of Justice had to determine the locality in the world that should be used as the BahÃ¡âÃ­ meridian and the manner in which the BahÃ¡âÃ­ calendar could be adjusted to enable the Birthdays of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h and of the BÃ¡b to occur on two consecutive days, as indicated in BahÃ¡âÃ­ texts attributed to BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h Himself. In its letter of July 10, 2014, the Universal House of Justice gave its answers to these two questions. As of Naw-RÃºz 2015, the BahÃ¡âÃ­ meridian will be the city of Tehran, where the spring equinox will determine the first day of the BahÃ¡âÃ­ year. From that year onward the two Birthdays will be internationally observed according to a lunar reckoning within the solar calendar, the dates of which will be announced in good time by the Universal House of Justice.\n\nThe Writings and Utterances of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h, such as those published in Gleanings from the Writings of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h, clearly stipulate that Tehran was indeed the âmother of the world,â âthe source of the joy of all mankind,â âthe holy and shining cityâ and âthe land of resplendent glory.â What other city had been so praised by the Blessed Beauty? It seems Tehran was destined to be the meridian of the future World Order. To an Oriental pilgrim Shoghi Effendi once said that the Prophet Muá¸¥ammad had called Mecca âthe mother of villages,â but BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h had conferred the title âmother of the worldâ to His native city. As to the question of the observances of the Twin Birthdays, as indicated in Note 138 of The KitÃ¡b-i-Aqdas (pages 224â225), what BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h meant by the two birthdays being as one day (in Questions and Answers #2) was that they should fall on two consecutive days. This is confirmed in a letter written on behalf of the Guardian. To explain fully this provision in the Aqdas, I will quote the following passage from Note 138 mentioned above:\n\nâIn the Muslim lunar calendar these [i.e. the anniversaries of the Births of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h and the BÃ¡b] fall on consecutive days, the birth of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h on the second day of the month of Muá¸¥arram 1233 A.H. (12 November 1817), and the birth of the BÃ¡b on the first day of the same month 1235 A.H. (20 October 1819), respectively. They are thus referred to as the âTwin Birthdaysâ and BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h states that these two days are accounted as one in the sight of God (Q&A 2).â I will discuss the calendar in more detail below.\n\nROLES STATUSES and IDENTITY\n\nRoles and statuses are more diffuse in this 21st century, and a personal sense of identity is the result to a higher degree from structures and narratives pieced together by individuals from many sources. This idea is found in: (i) Dominique Bouchet, The Lost Bond and the Good Life: Identity, Family and Couples in a Social-Philosophical Perspective; (ii) The Good Life: More than One's Self, Ed. Niels Jakob Harbo, 2004, pp.149-68; and (iii) Charles Taylor, The Ethics of Authenticity. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1991. Individuals must be able to engage actively in the construction of their roles, at any moment navigating from one \"reality\" to another, mobilizing themselves in sense-making actions. Individuals become entrepreneurs of their own lives, inventing and reinventing identity by means of actions and choices. Consequently, it becomes essential for many organizations, and especially the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith with its highly diverse membership spread over more than 230 countries and territories, to provide an attractive narrative framework of identity and purpose within which the individual can construct and reconstruct his or her personal narrative. This new culture of learning and growth does just that and has been doing it with greater efficacy as the years have gone on in the last two decades: 1996 to 2015.\n\nThis new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture has been, is & will be a response to changing communication needs both outside & within the BahÃ¡'Ã­ organizational framework. This Faith has long recognized the importance of creating a strong organizational culture as a means to establish feelings of organizational uniqueness. From the perspective of management and metaphors, stories and discourse practices have been used strategically to constitute approved frames of interpretation. Such practices influence the members' perception of organizational life and values. Similarly, there is a recognition of the strong link and necessary coherence between organizational identity, that is, what members of organizations perceive as their own and the organization's values, vision and mission, and corporate identity. Corporate identity is the organization's identity, or brand, communicated to stakeholders outside the organization. This has been a slowly evolving entity since at least the 1980s, if not in the decades before for possibly a century or more, and it has been enhanced many fold in this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm. To put this another way, the public image of this Cause has been enlarged and articulated in a much more specific framework of values and beliefs since the mid-1990s.\n\nThis book is one aspect of what is for me a systematic and determined action undertaken within the wide embrace of the present Five Year Plan's(2011-2016) framework. I also see this book as part of the most constructive response that I, as a concerned BahÃ¡'Ã­, can make to the multiplying ills of a disordered society. I see myself as contributing, in the best way I can, to a new kind of collective life which gives practical expression to all that is heavenly in human beings. There are at least two important capacities that contribute powerfully to this goal and in which I am engaged. The first capacity is to aim at creating a space that contributes to the spiritual character of a community; the second is engaging in elevated conversation which i do in the main in cyberspace and, as time and circumstances permit, in real space.\n\nTHE STRATEGY OF NARRATIVE\n\nThe strategy of individuals and organizations using narrative proceeds from an understanding that identity is constructed actively by subjects. As former collectively defined understandings of roles and identity have disintegrated in recent decades, individuals are no longer primarily oriented by common, predetermined logics. Formerly, individuals relied on preordained or inherited roles and status to make sense of their lives. Today, however, roles and statuses are more diffuse, as I say above, and identity results to a higher degree from structures and narratives pieced together by individuals themselves. They must be able to engage actively in the construction of roles, at any moment navigating from one \"reality\" to another, mobilizing themselves in sense-making actions. Individuals become entrepreneurs of their own lives, as I say above, inventing and reinventing identity by means of actions and choices. Consequently, it becomes essential for organizations to provide an attractive narrative framework of identity and purpose within which the individual can construct and reconstruct his or her personal narrative. After 60 years of going to BahÃ¡'Ã­ meetings and interacting with literally 1000s of people, both within the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community and within dozens of other communities I have watched this process in fine detail. This is a somewhat complex subject which I will leave to readers to examine to the extent their interest engages their reading habits. The internet is now awash with sources and resources for individuals to further their intellectual and academic, their social and psychological proclivities.\n\nHowever complex and confused the scene, the House of Justice emphasized in its Ridvan 2015 message, \"yet there is reassurance in the knowledge that, amidst the disintegration, a new kind of collective life is taking shape which gives practical expression to all that is heavenly in human beings. We have observed how, especially in those places where intensity in teaching and community-building activities has been maintained, the friends have been able to guard themselves against the forces of materialism that risk sapping their precious energies. Not only that, but in managing the various other calls upon their time, they never lose sight of the sacred and pressing tasks before them. Such attentiveness to the needs of the Faith and to humanityâs best interests is required in every community. Where a programme of growth has been established in a previously unopened cluster, we see how the initial stirrings of activity arise out of the love for BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h held in the heart of a committed believer.\"\n\n\"Notwithstanding the orders of complexity that must eventually be accommodated as a community grows in size, all activity begins with this simple strand of love. It is the vital thread from which is woven a pattern of patient and concentrated effort, cycle after cycle, to introduce children, youth, and adults to spiritual ideas; to foster a feeling for worship through gatherings for prayer and devotion; to stimulate conversations that illuminate understanding; to start ever-growing numbers on a lifetime of study of the Creative Word and its translation into deeds; to develop, along with others, capacity for service; and to accompany one another in the exercise of what has been learned. Beloved friends, loved ones of the AbhÃ¡ Beauty: We pray for you in earnest on every occasion we present ourselves at His Holy Threshold, that your love for Him may give you the strength to consecrate your lives to His Cause.\"\n\nSection 3.1:\n\nNarrative patterns and operations provide ways to make sense of life's myriad elements, for seeing life as meaningful. Stories, as Ricoeur writes, are a means of creating an interpretation of life, to avoid the meaninglessness of a life unexamined. Life is, he writes, \"in quest of narrative\". Individuals seek \"concordance,\" or harmony, among the countless components of existence. Through narratives, logical connections and cohesion emerge among the many disparate actions, impressions and events that occur over time. Emplotment, as Ricoeur writes, enables the subject to gather and organize life's many elements, which enables an interpretation and understanding of them. This new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm is made to measure for individuals to enhance the articulation of their life-narrative. One decisive characteristic of the individual in this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture is his or her response to the call of a quest: an existential journey with tasks to accomplish and obstacles to overcome. The medieval knight slayed the dragon; the modern hero, participant in this BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm, uses knowledge, skills and talent to battle both his inner life and the external challenges. The vast and complex framework of BahÃ¡'Ã­ activity provides an implicit model for an individual to quest through concrete descriptions of community work which demands both individual expertise and passionate personal involvement.\n\nThis new culture requires individuals with a conscience; ethical considerations play a central part in the construction of the individual's personal and professional identity. In these organizational-participant stories, experts and specialists are staged as young and powerful characters in pathos-based stories of how to make the world a better place for humankind. To be seen as \"making a difference\" is a powerful part of professional and personal self-fulfillment, as exemplified in the advertisements. As the House of Justice points out in its Ridvan 2015 message the call to support the work \"evokes a response in every heart that aches at the wretched condition of the world, the lamentable circumstances from which so many people are unable to gain relief. For, ultimately, it is systematic, determined, and selfless action undertaken within the wide embrace of the Planâs framework that is the most constructive response of every concerned believer to the multiplying ills of a disordered society.\"\n\nThe human desire to make sense, and create coherence, out of life's flux of experiences and offerings, by holding out narrative models for prospective identity-making, lies at the core of this new paradigm. The communicative strategy of offering a story into which the participant can write himself or herself is not only a break with traditional genres of engineering discourse, but also an acknowledgement by corporations that organizational identity is flexible and can be shaped by stories, of which the individual narrative is one. It is also this mutability that allows for the narrative process of self-creation. At the same time, the narrative model offered in this culture rejects scepticism towards science, technology and progress, by asserting that science, and the company that uses it, is a means to change the lives of individuals for the better. They are based on assumptions that the world is, after all, improvable and that an individual can make a difference.\n\nSection 3.2:\n\nThis new culture makes direct appeals to individuals to convey the value of the Cause to others; this is at the core of the teaching and consolidation, service and social activism aspects of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. The emphasis placed on the individual, on developing his or her talents, and on cultivating ambition for the sake of both self-fulfillment and community cohesion; as well as the emphasis placed on the wider community results in a bond between the individual, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community and the wider society. Through the narrative framework of individual stories, this new culture tries to appeal to the identity and aspirations of the specialist and create organizational scenarios in which professional and personal quests can be fulfilled. In writing him or herself into the story of the community then, the individual utilizes a narrative model as a tool for creating coherence, and finding meaning, in professional and personal life in organizational and social contexts.\n\nOf course, this process with both simple and complex parameters, does not always result in making an appeal to everyone who comes in contact with a BahÃ¡'Ã­ and/or the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. Each BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has its own history; some communities have grown into the millions in the last century, at one end of the growth spectrum, & some communities become stagnant with growth becoming an impossibility and even resulting in decline in membership. In many localities the growth in this new paradigm has been extensive, but in thousands of localities this has not been the case.\n\nStatistical estimates of the worldwide BahÃ¡'Ã­ population are difficult to arrive at. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organised community, but the BahÃ¡'Ã­ population is spread out into almost every country and ethnicity in the world, being recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity, and the only religion to have grown faster than the population of the world in all major areas over the last century. The 5-7 million figure for BahÃ¡'Ã­s worldwide almost certainly started with the first publication of the World Christian Encyclopedia. Before that appeared, no third party figures were available.\n\nOfficial estimates of the worldwide BahÃ¡'Ã­ population come from the BahÃ¡'Ã­ World Centre, which claimed \"more than five million BahÃ¡âÃ­s\" as early as 1991 \"in some 100,000 localities.\" That was five years before this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture came into being by degrees from the mid-to-late 1990s. The official agencies of the religion have published data on numbers of local and national spiritual assemblies, Counselors and their auxiliaries, countries of representation, languages, and publishing trusts. Less often, they publish membership statistics. In recent years, the United States BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has been releasing detailed membership statistics.\n\nSection 3.3:\n\nIn the 1930s the BahÃ¡'Ã­s of the United States and Canada began requiring new adherents to sign a declaration of faith, stating their belief in BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h, the BÃ¡b, and `Abdu'l-BahÃ¡, and an understanding that there are laws and institutions to obey. The original purpose of signing a declaration card was to allow followers to apply for lawful exemption from active military service. The signature of a card later became optional in Canada, but in the US is still used for records and administrative requirements. Many countries follow the pattern of the US and Canada.\n\nOther than signing a card and being acknowledged by a Spiritual Assembly, there is no initiation or requirement of attendance to remain on the official roll sheets. Members receive regular mailings unless they request not to be contacted. The fact that the religion is diffuse rather than concentrated is the major barrier to demographic research by outsiders. Surveys and censuses (except government census, which ask individuals their religion in many countries) simply cannot yet be conducted with such a scope, especially not at the level required to accurately gauge religious minorities. In some countries the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith is illegal and BahÃ¡'Ã­s endure some degree of persecution, making it difficult for even BahÃ¡'Ã­s to maintain a count.\n\nThe World Christian Database (WCD), and its predecessor the World Christian Encyclopedia, has reviewed religious populations around the world and released results of their investigations at various times. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith has consistently placed high in the statistics of growth over these various releases of data: 1970 to 1985, 1990 to 2000, 2000 to 2005, and across the whole range of their data from 1970 to 2010. From the mid-1960s until 2000, the US BahÃ¡'Ã­ population went from 10,000 to 140,000 on official rolls, but the percent of members with known addresses dropped to fifty percent. BahÃ¡'Ã­ community life often places demands both psychological and social on those who join its ranks, demands that prove to be more than the new member bargained-for. And so it is when the bloom comes off the rose, so to speak, and the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ comes to realize just what it is that he or she joined. The initial spark of enthusiasm loses its excitement, its attraction, and the person either resigns or simply becomes inactive. They cease to take part in BahÃ¡'Ã­ community life and often they can not be contacted. The growth of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community across more than 230 countries and territories is a highly varied and complex narrative.\n\nMost denominations make no effort at all to maintain a national membership database and must rely on local churches or surveys of the general population. Local church membership rolls are often maintained poorly because there may be no need for an official membership list (BahÃ¡'Ã­s at least must maintain accurate voting lists) and local congregations sometimes do not provide their denomination's membership data even when asked. Counting American Jews, half of whom are married to non-Jews and the majority of whom do not attend a synagogue, is immensely difficult. Estimates for the numbers of American Muslims and Eastern Orthodox often vary by a factor of two. I mention these other faith communities, as they are often called, because the entire field of statistics is often a dog's breakfast to use a term I have come to appreciate after more than 40 years of living Downunder. Australia in one of the most secular and skeptical, cynical but delightfully honest and humorous communities on the planet; I have slowly come to appreciate and enjoy its vast landscape and its cultural complexities which have grown on me by sensible and insensible degrees since I arrived here in my mid-twenties from Canada.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO A NEW BAHA'I PARADIGM\n\nContext: 1796 to 1996\n\nPart 1:\n\nFrom the last years of the 18th, to the last years of the 19th, century; from the early years of the twentieth century, to the first years of that fin de siecle decade, 1990 to 2000, a large group of men and women were themselves engaged in one of the greatest paradigm shifts in history. The first of these men and women were connected with the precursors of the Babi-religion(1796-1843); the next group with the Babi-religion itself(1844-1863), then another group with BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h(1863-1892), and then yet other groups in a wide variety of ways with Abdul-Baha(1892-1921), then with Shoghi Effendi(1921-1957) and, finally, with the Universal House of Justice(1963-1996). One and all, and in a myriad of ways and means, circumstances and situations, they laid the foundation for what has become, in the last 20 years, a new culture of learning in the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. Through this vast array of shared membership and affiliation, activity and enterprise, over two centuries they took part, knowingly and unknowingly, in a new, non-western, spiritual movement, engaged in a wide-ranging transnational reform enterprise. They were the earliest forerunners, and then eastern-born and western-born followers of the BahÃ¡âÃ­ Faith, an âOrientalâ religion originating in mid-nineteenth century Persia whose twin founders, the BÃ¡b and BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h, claimed to have inaugurated a new universal era of peace, religious harmony and social progress.\n\nA modern religious movement, the BahÃ¡âÃ­ faith has resisted the equation of modernism or feminism with secularism, and religion with secular and partisan politics. Instead what was for many decades seen as a Movement gradually became an independent, a separate, a new religion with its own scriptures and laws, its own calendar and holy days, its own saints and heroes. It gradually escaped the gravitational pull of the religion within which it had been 'birthed.' In similar ways that Christianity became a new religion, and not a Jewish sect, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ faith had by the late 1920s, and more and more as the decades of the 20th century advanced, become a world religion, spreading its membership across virtually every country on the planet by the 21st century. The BahÃ¡'Ã­s saw this religion they belonged to, under the guidance of its appointed and elected leadership from 1921 to the present, as a means for the liberation of men and women everywhere, and the foundation for a new Order. This group of eastern and western men and women not only exemplified a form of millennial religious enthusiasm in their adoption and promotion of the newest, the latest, of the Abrahamic religions, the BahÃ¡âÃ­ faith, and its mythology; but, more significantly, they worked to inaugurate a new World Order predicated on the spiritual and social equality of people everywhere, and the vast literature and quite detailed teachings of the Central Figures of their religion.\n\nPart 1.1:\n\nThe BahÃ¡'Ã­ calendar, also called the BadÃ­â calendar (badÃ­â means wondrous or unique) was first used by BÃ¡bism and then the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith. It is a solar calendar with years composed of 19 months of 19 days each, (361 days) plus an extra period of \"Intercalary Days\". Years in the calendar begin at the vernal equinox, and are counted with the date notation of BE (BahÃ¡'Ã­ Era), with 21 March 1844 CE being the first day of the first year, the year the BÃ¡b proclaimed his religion. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ calendar's implementation has changed over time. The calendar was first implemented and used by the BÃ¡bÃ­ faith and then adapted for use in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, with some changes. However, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ scriptures left a number of issues regarding the implementation of the calendar to be resolved by the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the BahÃ¡'Ã­s, before the calendar could be observed uniformly worldwide. Until 20 March 2015 the calendar was locked to the Gregorian calendar with the new year always being March 21. However, on 10 July 2014 the Universal House of Justice announced provisions that will enable the common implementation of the calendar worldwide, beginning at sunset 20 March 2015. Beginning in March 2015 the calendar will no longer be locked to the Gregorian calendar and the new year will start on the day of the vernal equinox. The period from 21 March 2014 to 20 March 2015 is the year 171 BE. This elaboration of the calendar is just one of many areas of increasing specificity, and increasing complexity in the functioning of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community globally during this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm.\n\nThe BahÃ¡'Ã­ calendar in western countries was synchronized to the Gregorian calendar, meaning that the extra day of a leap year occurs simultaneously in both calendars so there would be 4 intercalary days in most years, and 5 intercalary days during a leap year. The practice in western countries has been to start the year at sunset on March 20, regardless of when the vernal equinox technically occurs. From Naw-RÃºz 2015. In 2014, the Universal House of Justice selected Tehran, the birthplace of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h, as the location to which the date of the vernal equinox is to be fixed, thereby \"unlocking\" the BadÃ­' calendar from the Gregorian calendar. For determining the dates, astronomical tables from reliable sources are used. In the same message the Universal House of Justice decided that the birthdays of the BÃ¡b and BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h will be celebrated on \"the first and the second day following the occurrence of the eighth new moon after Naw-RÃºz\" (also with the use of astronomical tables) and fixed the dates of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Holy Days in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ calendar, standardizing dates for BahÃ¡'Ã­s worldwide. These changes will come into effect as of sunset on 20 March 2015.\n\nThe BahÃ¡'Ã­ calendar is composed of 19 months, each with 19 days.[2] The Nineteen Day Fast is held during the final month of âAlÃ¡â (2 March â 20 March), and is preceded by the intercalary days, known as AyyÃ¡m-i-HÃ¡. There are four intercalary days in a regular year, and five in a leap year.[16] The introduction of intercalation marked an important break from Islam, as under the Islamic calendar the practice of intercalation had been specifically prohibited in the Qur'an.[4] The month of fasting is followed by Naw-RÃºz, the new year. Until 2015, the calendar was effectively synchronized with the Gregorian calendar so that BahÃ¡'Ã­ leap years coincide with common era leap years. In addition, the intercalary days include 28 February and 1 March, causing precise synchronization of the 19 months with the Gregorian calendar. After 2015, the number of the intercalary days will be set as needed to ensure that the year ends on the day before the next vernal equinox\n\n. The names of the months were taken by the BÃ¡b from the Du'ay-i-Sahar, a Ramadan dawn prayer by Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam of Twelver Shi'ah Islam.[17][18] These month names are described as describing attributes of God. In the Persian Bayan the BÃ¡b divides the months in four groups, of three, four, six and six months respectively.[19] Robin Mirshahi suggests a possible link with four realms described in BahÃ¡'Ã­ cosmology. The days of the month have the same names as the names of the month - the 9th day of the month for example is the same as the 9th month - AsmÃ¡, or \"Names\". In the following table, the Gregorian date indicates the first full day of the month. The month begins at sunset of the Gregorian date previous to the one listed, after which time that month's Nineteen Day Feast may be celebrated.\n\nI could outline many areas of increasing cultural and community specificity in addition to those associated with the calendar as outlined above, in the first two decades of the nature and functioning of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture; examples could include, among others: prayer and meditation, attitudes to non-believers in all sorts of categories from homosexuals to people with a variety of disabilities. The teachings insofar as the moral and ethical, spiritual and community parameters are concerned have found a more extensive set of refinements and explanatory frameworks. I leave this to readers with the interest in the now massive articulation of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ teachings, especially available in cyberspace for interested seekers.\n\nPart 1.1.1:\n\nIn their motivations and reform activities, these men & women both resembled & diverged from the great pantheon of reformers & missionary people, political evangelists and social activists. The millennial new World Order they envisioned promised world peace, social and economic justice, and a spiritualization of the planet, similar to Christian expectations of the âKingdom of God on Earth.â However, BahÃ¡âÃ­ conceptions of a ânew heaven and earthâ differed from those of other religious and millennial groups, other political and quasi-utopian factions and formations. The differences were found in the delineation of the doctrinal spiritual and social principles contained in the sacred writings of the BahÃ¡âÃ­ faith. The process was envisaged as being gradual; the revolution quiet and unobtrusive, at least in some respects, although the deaths of more than 20,000 of its early believers was anything but quiet and unobtrusive. Also, unlike other western groups, efforts to implement these principles were guided first by a centralized middle-eastern leadership represented by âAbduâl BahÃ¡ Abbas from 1892-1921 and, then after His death, by His grandson, Shoghi Effendi Rabbani from 1921-1957. After 1957, the centralized leadership was not middle-eastern and, for more than 50 years, that leadership has been elected by the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community by a process of direct and indirect elections.\n\nBahÃ¡âÃ­s believe that a universal paradigm shift, instigated by Divine Will and already in existence for arguably two centuries, would gradually institute a new gender-equitable global civilization. This civilization would gradually come into being through cooperative human efforts both within the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community and without in which both men and women would play a major role. The story of the last twenty years of the extension of this two-century-long paradigmatic shift, an extension taken in a particular direction of learning and growth, culture and activity, is at the center of this book.\n\nPart 2:\n\nThis book is the longest analysis and commentary on the last 20 years of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm, a continuation in many ways, a further development, in the overall paradigmatic shift that first took place within messianic Shi'ism, and then within Babism. The particular development of interest here, the especial part of that paradigm-shift, took place as a heterodox and seemingly negligible offshoot of the Shaykhi school of the Ithna-Ashariyyah-sect, of Shi'ah Islam was transformed into a world religion. That transformation took place largely within the conceptual universe of Shi'ism and, then from the 1860s, within the progressive expansion and establishment of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ faith. By 1996 I had been involved with the Bahai Faith in many different ways for more than four decades, and the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith had developed a vast international administrative apparatus that extended into at least a 130,000 centers in the world and, perhaps, well over 150,000 localities.\n\nBy 1996, too, that two-century-long shift which was centered quintessentially in the persons of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h and the Bab had effloresced in fully legitimate and universally accepted elected institutions for more than 3 decades, or 75 years, depending on just how one defined and described that process of institutionalization of charisma to draw on that erudite sociologist Max Weber. Weber's terminology and his sociology of religion have provided, for me as well as many other BahÃ¡'Ã­s, a useful intellectual matrix for the articulation of this institutionalizing process.\n\nContext 1996 to 2015\n\nTHIS BOOK\n\nPart 1:\n\nThis book is the longest analysis of the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning and growth that is currently available in the Bahai community, although several other books have appeared since this piece of writing first appeared in cyberspace in 2007. Some of those books have devoted part of their content to this new culture of learning. The overarching perspective in this book is a personal one that attempts to answer the question: \"where do I fit into this new paradigm?\" Readers are left to work out their own response to this question as readers inevitably must, now and in the decades ahead, as this new paradigm has developed and will develop a highly diverse life of its own within the framework already established in the first two decades of its operation: 1996 to 2015. Each BahÃ¡'Ã­ has to work out what form his or her ready, or not-so-ready, embrace of the unfolding guidance of the Plan will take. Each BahÃ¡'Ã­ has to work out what form, what attitude, what ways and means, what particular activities their approach to learning and the cultural attainments of the mind will take in this new paradigm.\n\nThe question now, as one prominent BahÃ¡'Ã­ writer put it, is not \"if\" but \"how\" each BahÃ¡'Ã­ will engage themselves, will participate, in this new paradigm as the first century of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Formative Age comes to an end in 2021, and its second century unfolds in the years beyond 2021. I will be nearly 80 in 2021 as this third millennium continues to challenge all of humanity in ways that can now only be dimly envisaged. In 2044 I will 100 and the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Era(BE) will be two centuries into its predicted 1000 year history. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ cycle, and the Revelation proclaimed by BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h, will extend over a period of at least five hundred thousand years, such is the BahÃ¡'Ã­ belief, the long range BahÃ¡'Ã­ historical and futuristic perspective.\n\nPart 1.1:\n\nIn accordance with the principle of progressive revelation every Manifestation of God must needs vouchsafe to the peoples of His day a measure of divine guidance ampler than any which a preceding and less receptive age could have received or appreciated. For this reason, and not for any superior merit which the BahÃ¡âÃ­ Faith may be said to inherently possess, does a number of prophecies bear witness to the unrivaled power and glory with which the Dispensation of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h has been investedâa Dispensation the potentialities of which we are but beginning to perceive and the full range of which we can never determine.\n\nThe Faith of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h should indeed be regarded, if we wish to be faithful to the tremendous implications of its message, as the culmination of a cycle, the final stage in a series of successive, of preliminary and progressive revelations. These, beginning with Adam and ending with the BÃ¡b, have paved the way and anticipated with an ever-increasing emphasis the advent of that Day of Days in which He Who is the Promise of All Ages should be made manifest.\n\nPart 1.2:\n\nTo the truths I have mentioned above, part and parcel of BahÃ¡'Ã­ belief, the utterances of BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h abundantly testify. A mere reference to the claims which, in vehement language and with compelling power, He Himself has repeatedly advanced cannot but fully demonstrate the character of the Revelation of which He was the chosen bearer. To the words that have streamed from His penâthe fountainhead of so impetuous a Revelationâwe should, therefore, direct our attention if we wish to obtain a clearer understanding of its importance and meaning. I try to do this in my book, a book which is getting longer as each month of this paradigm advances. This book is in need of a good editor, but it may be some time before such a skilled person is found.\n\nWhether in His assertion of the unprecedented claim He has advanced, or in His allusions to the mysterious forces He has released, whether in such passages as extol the glories of His long-awaited Day, or magnify the station which they who have recognized its hidden virtues will attain, BahÃ¡âuâllÃ¡h and, to an almost equal extent, the BÃ¡b and âAbduâl-BahÃ¡, have bequeathed to posterity mines of such inestimable wealth as none of us who belong to this generation can befittingly estimate. Those of us who have lived through the first two decades of this new paradigm have only begun to understand its quickening wind.\n\nSuch testimonies found in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ writings, bearing on the themes to which I have referred above, are impregnated with such power and reveal such beauty as only those who are versed in the languages in which they were originally revealed can claim to have sufficiently appreciated. So numerous are these testimonies that a whole volume would be required to be written in order to compile the most outstanding among them. All I can venture to attempt at present is to share with you only such passages as I have been able to glean from His voluminous writings, and the writings of His legitimate successors as I try to come to grips with the implications of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning and growth in the following pages.\n\nTHE INTERNET\n\nSection 1:\n\nIn drawing on the works of other writers over the last nine years, 2007 to 2015, I should emphasize at the outset of this lengthy read that, by mid-March 2015, when my most recent additions and deletions, my most recent updates and editings of this book had taken place, the internet had come to possess a myriad print and audio-visual resources in connection with this new paradigm. There was also a vast expanse, an immense extension, of primary & secondary resource material that had become available in the last two decades in cyberspace. More than a little emphasis is given in this book, and in this new paradigm, to the internet. Since the mid-1990s, when this paradigm began its life across the thousands of localities where the Bahaâi community was and is found, this new culture had become a critical means for the growth of a distinctive Bahaâi ethos of learning. At the same time, the internet had transformed communication on the planet, at least for those with access to the world-wide-web. My book is just one of the seemingly infinite number of resources now available for the 5 to 8 million BahÃ¡'Ã­s, and some of the 100s of millions, indeed billions, of others on the planet who want to know or will want to know more about this new world Faith, & about its unfolding paradigm.\n\nThe advanced computational and communications technologies of the world wide web now play a highly varied, and diverse, set of roles in today's global economic, social, cultural, political, and even ecological orders. The new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture is one of the many cultures that have been transformed due to the internet. Evidence of this exists in technologies used to implement the internationalization, the globalization, of this BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning & growth. The world-wide-web lives in many of the individual & community manifestations of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning spread, as it is now, across 1000s of localities--arguably as many as 150 thousand or more---on the planet. The tools that shape this new media and its practices have transnational impacts and profoundly influence the global outreach of the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community.\n\nThe many new media tools in cyberspace provide contexts for local, regional, national, transnational, and global-scale interaction. The academic study and the practical everyday use of the world-wide-web is a truly interdisciplinary undertaking that has no fixed academic home and, by extension, no organized intra-disciplinary, self-regulating value system or ethics. In other words: it has no cohesive philosophical discourse. It is utilized by the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community at all levels in a virtually infinite number of ways. The internet is embedded in the larger societal and cultural, subjective and objective, economic and community structures of lived experience on our planet of 7.3 billion members, the global population as of January 2015. The systems and sequences, patterns and frameworks within which BahÃ¡'Ã­s exist and operate are now deeply connected to the WWW. At the same time, through this embededness, this new digital media, acts back on the social so that its specific capabilities can engender new concepts of both the individual and the social, of the possible and seemingly impossible. I have devoted some of the initial paragraphs of this book to the internet because of the very pervasiveness of cyberspace in today's world, and because of the profound changes it has brought about not only in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community, but in my own life as I head through the last decade(70 to 80) of late adulthood, as some developmental psychologists call the years from 60 to 80 in the lifespan, and as my writings have begun to acquire a readership across cyberspace now numbering in the millions, something I could scarcely have believed in the opening years of this new paradigm.\n\nSection 2:\n\nThe influence of science and technology on the experience and growth of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community since the middle of the 19th century, as well as the other kinds of communities on the planet, would make a book in itself. The vast expansion of print culture, of communication technology: the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, the television; of the means of transportation: shipping, the car, the train, the airplane and jet--have, one and all, overcome much of the tyranny of distance that was the reality of human experience until the 19th and 20th centuries. They have transformed human activity and resulted in changes that were and are more profound than any in humanity's preceding history, changes that are, for the most part, little understood by the present generation.\n\nThe communication and the communicating subject, the individual, in cyberspace is endowed with a great deal of autonomy in relation to, and over and above, many of the major and dozens of the minor institutions and organizations of communication that exist in the wide-wide-world. The paradigm shift that is the new culture of learning and growth in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has taken place at the same time as the paradigm shift in communication. This latter shift has resulted from the internet since at least those mid-1990s. This transformation of communication is, in some ways, a transformation from mass communication to mass self-communication. The autonomy of social actors like myself has increased and, therefore, the power relationships in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community as well as the larger society have altered. The authority structure in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has not altered, but the power relationships certainly have. I do not want to overemphasize this subject, but I would like to comment on it briefly below.\n\nIn social science and politics, power and authority have come under analytical scrutiny in the last half century, to say nothing of any scholarhip in the previous century and centuries. My views of power and authority come closest to those of Richard Sennett(1943- ), the Centennial Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics and University Professor of the Humanities at New York University. His books \"The Fall of Public Man\" and \"Authority\" published in 1977 and 1980 respectively provide, for me at least, a series of helpful perspectives on the concepts of authority and power. The term authority is often used for power perceived as legitimate within some social structure. Power can be seen as evil or unjust, but the exercise of power is accepted as endemic to humans as social beings. In the corporate environment, power is often expressed as upward or downward. With downward power, a company's superior influences subordinates. When a company exerts upward power, it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of the leader. These are all somewhat conventional views. Richard Sennett writes with a gentleness rare in academically-styled prophets with a tone indeed as well as a conviction like Toquevilleâs own. Readers here with the interest might like to have a look at this French historian and sociologist who wrote a two volume work on Democracy in America when BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h was in his teens and twenties, the 1830s and early 1840s.\n\nSennett has embarked upon an extended account over several decades of the current state of affairs in our rapidly globalizing world. His two books which I have mentioned above are the first of several on the subjects of power and authority, and I leave it to readers to further their interests, if interests they have in the complexities of what power and authority actually mean. Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859) also wrote two books in his role as French political thinker and historian. He is best known for his works Democracy in America which appeared in two volumes: 1835 and 1840. I leave all this with readers.\n\nSection 3:\n\nIt is not my intention to go into the many tributaries of social and political thought, and the many thinkers ancient and modern, whose ideas are relevant to the several contexts that this book explores within the paradigmatic reality of the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture. A unity of concept and knowledge has been slowly emerging and a framework, a matrix that organizes thought and gives shape to activities and becomes more elaborate as experience accumulates, has been developing in recent decades. The notion of a framework is central to advancing the work of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community within this paradigm. Paul Lample expanded on this idea at a recent ABS conference in Canada, in August 2014, and I leave it to readers to Google his remarks, as they Google many a subject in their own efforts to define the ongoing &important relationships between the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith and the wider society in which it exists and has its being.\n\nThe nature of the altered power relations implicit in the recent communication shift, due to the internet, has possibly four particular features or sources of influence and significance. All of them are complex and all of them will develop lives of their own in the decades ahead. The internet and cyberspace and their several accompanying technologies have several consequences in relation to the power relationships with which I am concerned here. The new mass self-communication provides for people like me: (i) with networking power which is the power to include or exclude entities from my system of communication; (ii) with network power which is the power to set the terms of the interactions that take place within the system through protocols that I define; (iii) with networked power which is the power of enabled social actors over other social actors within the system; and finally, (iv) with network-making power which is the power to shape a system by installing protocols that adhere to my particular goals and values. These ideas are, as I say above, somewhat complex & I hope in the pages which follow to be able to provide a context to assist readers in understanding the concrete manifestations of these abstract ideas. They are also complex and difficult for me to understand. We are all in a new world, a parallel universe, a universe and a world which has been transformed time and time again since the middle of the 19th century.\n\nSection 4:\n\nLetter writing as well as writing prose and poetry across several genres of literature, has taken-on a whole new context and meaning in cyberspace for me after some 50 years of writing letters and essays, prose and poetry, notebooks & books in real space: 1954 to 2004. Since emails and the internet emerged by sensible and insensible degrees in the last two decades, 1994 to 2015, literary communication has been revolutionized. In some ways, this new form of literary exchange is not unlike previous decades and centuries when writing was one of the major forms of communication in society. At least this has become true for some writers like myself who utilize cyberspace as their central medium of publicizing their literary wares: books and ebooks, essays and posts at internet sites, narrative and expository details and accounts.\n\nI could spend all my time now writing emails and posting at internet sites. I could write: (i) short and pithy posts of a line or two; (ii) posts of medium length, say, a paragraph or two, and (iii) long pieces of a page or more. But, since I have other literary interests, since I have reinvented myself in recent years, in the years of this new paradigm---and am now a writer and author, poet and publisher, editor and researcher, online blogger and journalist, reader and scholar, I try to keep the sending of emails and internet posts, these new forms of communication, to a minimum. I spend as little time as possible writing: (a) emails and internet posts, and (b) letters and responses to others in cyberspace. If old friends wonder why I do not send them the short and snappy emails that I used to send to them at their email address, or at their Facebook page, or at some other internet site from, say, in those fin de siecle years of the 1990s and, even more recently in the first years of this 21st century, 2001 to 2009, this is the reason. In 2009 I went on an old-age pension and gradually began to write less and less to the 1000s of people who had come into my internet life. I slowly had to work-out an MO, as they say it in the who-dun-its, or I would spend all my time, 24/7 as they say these days, writing to others in cyberspace.\n\nI elaborate in some detail in the paragraphs below on my new MO, an MO that will take me through my 70s in the years 2014 to 2024, and beyond 2024, if I last that long into my old-age. The explanation I provide here is, in part at least, part of the general articulation of my business plan, of the literary industry, of my cyberspace MO, that has come to occupy my leisure-time, my retirement years, as I head into the evening of my life and its inevitable nightfall, death, that messenger of joy as BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h refers to this universal experience. This personal MO is also at the very centre of my own participation in the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm. Each BahÃ¡'Ã­ must work out their own personal MO, their modus operandi, for participation in the international BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. This book tells much about my way of going about things. My way is not a model for others to emulate. This book has a highly personal context and, as I say many times throughout the book, each BahÃ¡'Ã­ must work how how they will engage in BahÃ¡'Ã­ community life in this new paradigm.\n\nSection 5:\n\nAt various times toward the end of those fin de siecle years of the last century, say, 1995 to 1999, human character changed again. At least that is how some social theorists in the fields of sociology and history, psychology and anthropology, have expressed one of the results of all the new technology that has avalaunched into our lives in the last two decades. Human character, at least human interaction, began in those last years of the 20th century to undergo a metamorphosis that is still not complete. But it is profound! It is troubling and challenging for many. For millions, of course, it is irrelevant. This revolutionary change in communication patterns is scarcely understood in its historical context. But, it has become part of the very air we breath, seductively or not-so-seductively insinuating itself into our daily life, we who are connected to some or all of the new technologies. Peoples' responses to this technology are as various as they have been to all technological and human inventions since long before the agricultural, the neolithic, revolution 10,000 years ago which began to transform hunting and gathering communities all over the globe. This book is not an exploration of the internet, nor is it an exploration of the effects of science and technology since the emergence of homo sapiens sapiens. In these opening pages of discussion of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm, though, I have provided what I hope readers will find to be a useful, a relevant, context for the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning and growth.\n\nWhen I think about those late 1990s, as I was retiring from the world of paid employment and student life which had occupied me for half a century, 1949 to 1999, it seems like a 100 years ago, another age, another epoch. Whenever that last moment was, before most of us were on the internet and entering the email world, before we had mobile phones and cell phones, smartphones and iphones, that moment and those years seem like the end of another era. A technological paradigm-change has certainly taken-place in the last 20 years, at this climacteric of history as these first years of the 21st century have opened to the world's 7+ billions. Back in those pre-epochal change years of the 20th century, letters came once a day, predictably, in the hands of the postal carrier. News came in three flavors â radio, television, print â and at appointed hours. Some of us even had a newspaper delivered every morning. For more on this theme, and a stimulating overview of the recent changes in communication patterns, go to: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n16/rebecca-solnit/diary\n\nAs Martin Luther King, Jr. and, as many other philosophers and thinkers of prominence have described modern life in different ways: \"...all life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied together into a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. We are made to live together because of the interrelated structure of reality...Before you finish eating breakfast in the morning, youâve depended on more than half the world. This is the way our universe is structured; this is its interrelated quality. We arenât going to have peace on Earth until we recognize the basic fact of the interrelated structure of all reality and give this reality political and social expression in our institutional life.â(Ron Price with thanks to Martin Luther King, Jr)..The new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm has this concept placed squarely at its centre.\n\nTHIS BOOK AS A WORK OF ART:\n\nSection 1:\n\nPerhaps as a result of the lingering Symbolist inheritance, an aesthetic notion of most potency in the last 40 years, years since I became an international pioneer from Canada to Australia, and since I began to publish my writing in the various forms of the mass media---and certainly in the context of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm---is the idea that a work of art is in some sense about itself. The starting point of the Symbolist movement is the inner vision of the artist. For more, and for a context for this movement, go to: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v06/n11/barbara-everett/somebody-reading\n\nEven in the fine arts, apparently most in love with the visible world, the great painter will be said to paint himself in every portrait. The exquisite old lady reading in a pool of light holds the stillness of Rembrandt himself as he paints, and Velasquez looks back at us through the eyes of a court dwarf. I mention Rembrandt and Velasquez, two very famous artists, but I could just as easily have named any two of literally 100s, indeed, 100s of thousands of others. The artist, the poet, the creative personality, all recreate themselves as they go about their artistic work. So, too, does everyone else in the context of their daily life, although many would not express it that way.\n\nThis self-involvement may all the more readily be found in literature since most writers and, perhaps even more, poets tend to be experts on themselves. I write all this since my writing is overtly and explicitly, openly and directly, autobiographical. I am drawing here, in this brief analysis and description, on a book review in the London Review of Books, Vol. 6 No. 11, 21 June 1984 when I was just beginning to be published in the print media and also beginning to write my autobiography at the age of 40. The book review in question was by Barbara Everett. Everett is a British academic and literary critic. Her review is of a book by the famous poetry critic, arguably the most famous and erudite of poetry critics now alive, Helen Vendler. Everett is reviewing The Odes of Keats by Vendler(Harvard, 1984).\n\nSection 2:\n\nThis Book as the Current Centerpiece of My Literary Output\n\nA. The programmer or maker of the work, for example this book, in setting the terms of the conversation, can be said to shape the limits of engagement in relation to that work. Both myself and my readers, in turn, exert pressure on the system, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. We can strengthen the system, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community, by using it as the forum for communicating what we are writing & doing, thinking & imagining. But my book, potentially anyway, may also cause a negative input into the general BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. In the case of the new media, the internet, my book can also result in little or no influence or interaction. The digital media we now use are not neutral tools. They enact social, ethical and moral worldviews as this book attempts to do. The work I do as a writer and author is relevant, or so I like to think, so I assume. But what I write must be sensitive to BahÃ¡'Ã­ core values and ethics. Writers like myself need to possess both a disciplinary sense of being self-assured that what they are writing is good work within the intellectual culture that is the BahÃ¡'Ã­ international community. Their work must be underpinned by a strong ethical philosophy that is consistent with (i) the broad framework of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ teachings and (ii) their covenantal relationship with the Cause. At least those are some of the core parameters within which I work and have my literary being. Such, in broad terms, is how I see the wide context for this book on the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture.\n\nThis book had become, for me, a sort of centerpiece, not only within all the internet posts on the subject, but also within the context of my own writing in these last two decades. Readers wanting to understand this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture were not, and are not, short on analyses and commentary if they want to get a picture of what this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture was, is, and will be all about. After eight years of having this book in cyberspace this book has become somewhat irrelevant to the mass of readers who prefer, and generally read, only short posts, and for whom a book of this size is just too much in our 21st century world of print and image glut. Millions prefer the short and the pithy, the terse and the taut, the concise and the cryptic, the compact and the clipped to pages and pages of prose. Such is the preference and the proclivity of the Facebook and Twitter generation. That is fine; to each their own as we head into the first decades of this 21st century.\n\nB. As 2015 entered its autumn season, at least in the southern hemisphere,on 21/3/'15, and as spring had begun to open in country after country in the northern hemisphere; as the 50th anniversary of the election of the Universal House of Justice in April 1963 was about to become the 52nd in April 2015 and, as I was myself going through the last half of my 71st year, I found I was adding more and more to this book on a variety of topics that I had no intention of writing about back in 2007 at the inception of this work. There were always several occasions each year when the Universal House of Justice sent further explanatory messages which: (a) extended this new Bahaâi culture in either its structure and its functioning, or both, and which (b) provided a continuing exegisis for the benefit of a community which was striving to put in place the many dimensions of this new Bahaâi culture of learning and growth. I was always able, therefore, to add and edit, comment and analyse this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture at least several times each year. Who knows where and when this book would find its final edition? I had begun to find, though, as this second decade of the new paradigm was coming to a close, that it was becoming impossible for me to adequately cover all the aspects of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm unless I gave to this book virtually all my time. I was not able to do this for several reasons. I began to think that this work was going to become a survey of the first two decades of this new paradigm. As I write these words in the last year of the current Five Year Plan(2011 to 2016), this book has indeed become a picture of where things stand in this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture after twenty years.\n\nPerhaps my own life would come to an end first, at least it seemed to me that it would in all likelihood end long before this paradigm had completed its continuing and complex delineation, its articulation. At the centre of this paradigm was a community building function that had begun as far back as 1996. The structure of this new Faith, as I have already emphasized, had been slowly defined and described, developed and adumbrated for over a century by 1996, but the community within which that structure was to be articulated, within which it was to live and have its being, required its own timeline. Community building is a slow and difficult process, although it has some simple and quite easy to understand aspects. After two centuries of Babi-BahÃ¡'Ã­ history, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has been slowly coming into being all across the planet; little by little and day by day, a long and tedious process in many places, a series as systematic advances, wondrous leaps and thrusts from epoch to epoch, stage to stage, and Plan to Plan in other places. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has seen a remarkably dynamic period in which the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has changed markedly since the mid-1990s, to say nothing of the dynamism that I have witnessed as far back as 1953 when my family in Canada first came into contact with the revolutionizing forces of this Cause. There are many indicators of these changes and these forces, and this work sums them up in what has become a far too lengthy book, far too lengthy for the average member of this Facebook-Twitter generation.\n\nTHE BAHA'I WORLD CENTRE\n\nWith some 700 people now working at the BahÃ¡'Ã­ World Centre(BWC) in Israel and with 1000s of letters going out each year from various BahÃ¡'Ã­ institutions which operate at the BWC; with over 180 national BahÃ¡'Ã­ communities, some 12,000 to 15,000 locally elected BahÃ¡'Ã­ assemblies; and, as I have already indicated, an estimated 150 thousand localities where 5 to 8 million Bahais reside, the printed matter that now pours out into both the internet and real space is simply staggering. As Paul Lample pointed out at an ABS conference in August of 2014, there are now some 200 clusters in the world where 100 or more individuals are supporting the participation of 1000 or more individuals. The most advanced clusters have 500 people supporting the participation of more than 10,000 people. This book makes no attempt to survey, in even the sketchiest of ways, this Niagara, this avalanche, of text that now flows out over the BahÃ¡'Ã­ world as a result of the complex entity, the vast structure with its myriad functions, that is the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm. My aim in this now lengthening book is to provide a bird's-eye view, as it is often said, of the big picture. This newest of the world's Abrahamic religions and its culture of learning and growth as it has developed in the last two decades will keep serious readers busy here for some time. You may be advised to skim or scan, if you would like to get just those nuts and bolts which concern you and your personal interests.\n\nTHIS BOOK AS A USEFUL RESOURCE TO THE BAHA'I COMMUNITY\n\nThis book had become for many, but certainly not for most, a useful resource for readers wanting a macroscopic view of the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm. As 2015 advanced beyond 21/4/'15, as the 5th year of the present Plan(2011 to 2016)opened, and as the end of the second decade of this new paradigm approached(21/4/'16), I continued to edit a document that had grown to more than 790 pages(font 16). Editing is an endless task, as most serious writers find. Time would tell, given the highly dynamic nature of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm, and the extensive growth in the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture, just how large a book this piece of writing would become in the remaining months of the current FYP, and the years taking the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community in 2021 to the end of the first century of its Formative Age. There are now 1000s of books in cyberspace, books which best serve as door-stoppers, and are never read by the vast majority of human beings. This is, and will be, I am confident one of these large and bulky books. Cyberspace at least allows readers to take their contents in little chunks, chunks to suit their reading tastes and daily capacities, if it is chunks that are wanted. From my experience of some 20 years now in cyberspace, chunks is all people usually want from the burgeoning books on the internet. As we have moved into this 21st century, the pace of life seems to have accelerated with news coming at us 24/7, dozens of TV and radio stations; indeed, there are now more options for people to spend their leisure time than ever before. Such is the story for those of us in the advanced and developed economies.\n\nWhat appears to be emerging from the digital revolution is the possibility of a new mode of temporality for public communication, one in which public exchange through the written word can occur without deferral, in a continuously immediate present. It is a world in which we are all, through electronic writing, continuously present to one another, at least to the extent and in whatever ways we desire. This is true for intense and active internet writers like myself, although I am more than a little aware that this is not true of all people. It is not true of millions for whom the parallel universe that is cyberspace virtually does not exist.\n\nHalf the world is still not even connected to the internet and its cyberspace. My remarks here are intended to be of some use to that portion of the world for whom the internet is part of their daily bread & butter, so to speak. There is, I would like to suggest, an unprecedented and unpredictable set of qualities that have emerged in recent years; the possibility of the escape of writing from fixity is something that is difficult to grasp. What the digitalization of text seems to have opened up is the possibility for writing to operate in a temporal mode hitherto exclusively possible for speech, as parole rather than langue, (Hesse, 1996: 32), to use expressions from the analysis of language and linguistics. This âcontinuously immediate presentâ of writing allows one's writing projects, and one's conversations around those projects, to develop in a more fruitful, more organic fashion. Such is the case here; such is the way I have come to see this text among my many other writings in cyberspace. To put all this in the context of the new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture: the paradigmatic shift in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community has also involved a paradigmatic shift in the way I have gone about writing and publishing, interacting and communicating in the wide-wide-world of the wide-wide-web. This is also true for millions of others and all sorts of permuations and combinations unique to each person but, of course, possessing some patterns followed by millions of others.\n\nTHIS BOOK AND THE INTERNET: MORE COMMENTS\n\nPart 1:\n\nThis book has many styles of writing\n\nThere are now many ways that writing in cyberspace can be described. I have just written a few things in the paragraphs above and readers should not concern themselves if they don't understand some of the ways, some of the words, I have used. The internet is a new medium of communication, like the TV and the radio, the telephone and the telegraph before it. There is now an extensive literature on the subject of the internet and its ways and means of communicating. Each reader will, of course, have their own experience and their own level of interest in this subject. The majority of the 5 to 8 million BahÃ¡'Ã­s will never see this book; for less than half the world had access to the internet as of 2015. I write for a coterie, but so do all writers. Some coteries are big ones and some are little. After some 30,000 to 40,000 hits, I'd say this coterie is in the middle range; it is not likely to go viral, and I will never be either famous or rich, entities which have become somewhat complex in this digital age.\n\nWriters like myself in this document are willing to expose some of the process of editing online as they go about extending their work in cyberspace, in public. This process allows some readers, at least those with the interest who follow the ongoing changes in the text of this now lengthy book, to see some of the bumps and false starts that I have taken along the way, over the last eight years. I didnât at first sense, as I wrote the first edition of this work in cyberspace back in 2007, that I was even embarking on a book-length project; I only knew that I had a small, persistent series of questions that I wanted to think about to some extent. Having formulated an initial stab at some possible answers, and having been disagreed with, as well as supported and encouraged by those who read my work in its first three years online(2007 to 2009), the feedback from my commentators made me think in more complex ways about the issues Iâd presented. Only then was I able to recognize that there was more to be said, that there was something in the ideas to which I felt compelled to commit myself. Without the simple and highly focused beginnings of this book back in 2007, without those first questions and, by then, by 2007, a decade of thinking about this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture, as well as the often inadvertent process of drafting more and more commentary in the public space that is the internet, I would not have been led by sensible and insensible degrees to this longer text, a text that is now, as I say above, 790 pages(font 16). The book has come together bit by bit over the last 96 months.\n\nApproaching my writing from the perspective of process, thinking about how ideas move and develop from one form, one post, one piece of writing to the next, and thinking about the ways that those stages are represented, connected, preserved, and âcountedâ within new digital modes of publishing, all helped to foster what has become, for me, a highly fertile text. It may also be far too rambling for many a modern reader. I'm sure it is far too long for most who come across it in cyberspace at whatever site catches their eye, their gaze, their surfing mentality and style, interest inventory and personal circumstances. I took full advantage of the webâs particular and very real temporality, its sense of and use of time. A great deal of stuff that appears, that is published, on the web exists, in some sense, in a perpetual draft state, open to future change. Writers therefore, like myself,recognize both the need this creates for careful preservation of the historical record of the stages in a textâs life and the equal importance for all authors who utilize this cyberspace mechanism of approaching their work openly, thinking about how their texts might continue to grow even after theyâve seen the light of day in some 'published' form. The internet is a new world for both writers and readers. As a writer and teacher over many decades, I am fully aware of how much many find the process of analysis to be like a disease and, with a weary sigh, they often turn to other topics if the analysis goes on too long. Indeed, there are many potentially tortuous considerations which, as a writer, I simply ignore. One can not keep everyone happy all of the time with what one writes. As I often say in this book: I write for a coterie. I, too, often tire of analysis. One can not be on top of everyone's wordy wisdoms or one would exhaust oneself and drown in verbiage.\n\nPart 2:\n\nThis Book Has Many Authors\n\nThere is a âcontinuously immediate presentâin the writing of this book which allows this writing project of mine, and my conversation around this project, to develop in a more fruitful, more organic fashion. This will require a fairly radical shift in both my understanding and that of my readers in what it is I'm doing as I'm writing. If my text is going to continue to grow even as it is being published online, readers are going to need to be present in those texts in order to shepherd that growth â perhaps not forever, but certainly for longer than they have been with traditional print publishing. This thought will make many readers and writers nervous, in part because readers and writers already have difficulties with completing a project; if writers like myself have the opportunity to continue working on something forever, well, then what? On the other hand, would that necessarily be such a bad thing? I am freed to shift my attention away from publication as the moment of singularity in which a text transforms from nothing into something, and instead focus on the many important stages in my workâs coming-into-being.\n\nIn fact, all of this helps me as a writer to think of my career as a writer in a more holistic sense, as an ongoing process of development. I am free to take some or many key moments of writing, what some now call 'the moment of complexity', and see them not as a series of discrete closed projects. I can return again and again to the scene of the text in order to make changes as a result of changes in my thinking about something I had once committed to print. Or I can take old material in new directions. In the past this might have seemed somehow vaguely scandalous. Such abilities it seems to me lead to work that is better thought-through, more âsignificant'. But in order to take advantage of these abilities, writers and readers will first have to learn to value process over product, and to manifest that value in the assessments of literary work. This, of course, this emphasis on process over content has been part of the teaching of writing in many western countries for several decades now anyway.\n\nAs this text became increasingly available for the sort of ongoing development to which I refer above, I recognized more and more the degree to which I was no longer the sole author working on and in this book. This work became far more collaborative than any book I have written in the past. New modes of collaboration â over time, across distances â made possible by networked writing structures required me to think about originality quite differently, precisely because of the ways that these new modes intervened in my conventional associations of authorship with individuality, with this work as mine. This was a new world of publishing and it was a new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture as the fin de siecle closed and the first years of the 21st century advanced incrementally---and as I retired from FT, PT and most volunteer work that had kept me busy for half a century.\n\nThe two facets of conventional authorship, individuality and originality, are intertwined in complex and subtle ways: insisting that a text must consist of oneâs âownâ work is to insist that it make an original contribution to the field. The bottom-line, as they say these days, is that one's work is not simply one's own, not uniquely one's own. Not only does the operation of the digital network exclude the possibility of uniqueness in its very function, the links and interconnections that the network facilitates profoundly affect the shape of any given text. In digital scholarship, the relationships between the authors whose ideas we draw upon, and the texts that we produce are highly dynamic. The work of some of our predecessors is, in some sense, contained within whatever increasingly fuzzy boundaries draw the outlines of my use of texts. And so it is that readers may find this work somewhat fuzzy and not to their liking. It will be too long a read, as I say above, for many but, \"such is life\" as the Australian outlaw Ned Kelly is reported to have said on his way to the gallows in NSW in 1880.\n\nPart 3:\n\nThis New BahÃ¡'Ã­ Culture Has Many Commentators\n\nSince 1996, the year that this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture of learning and growth had its inception, there has been a wealth of new literature, both primary and secondary. I make no attempt to survey this vast landscape. I will cut-and-paste below a review of two books which throw some light on aspects of BahÃ¡'Ã­ culture which I have given little discussion of, important aspects, from my point of view. The two books also came out right at the start of this new BahÃ¡'Ã­ paradigm, although the reviews did not appear until the third year of the new paradigm. The two books are: (1) Symbol and Secret and (2) Revisioning the Sacred. The reviews are both by Jonah Winters and they were published in Iranian Studies, Vol 32, No.1, pages 141-145 in 1999. I had just retired from a 50 year student and employment life in 1999 and was beginning the reinvention of myself as a writer and author, poet and publisher, editor and researcher, reader and scholar, online blogger and journalist.\n\nSymbol and Secret: Qur'Ã¡n Commentary in BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's Kitab-i ÃqÃ¡n appeared in Studies in the BÃ¡bÃ­ and BahÃ¡'Ã­ Religions, volume 7. The author was Christopher Buck and the publisher KalimÃ¡t Press, Los Angeles, 1995. The second book was Revisioning the Sacred: New Perspectives on a BahÃ¡'Ã­ Theology. This article appeared in Studies in the BÃ¡bÃ­ and BahÃ¡'Ã­ Religions, volume 8. It was edited by Jack McLean and was published again by KalimÃ¡t Press, Los Angeles, 1997. KalimÃ¡t Press is, and was, a small, independent publishing house. It can fairly be described as the premier producer of academic material on the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith. Most notable of its contributions in this area is the \"Studies in BÃ¡bÃ­ and BahÃ¡'Ã­ History\" series, volume one of which appeared in 1982.(1) The volumes of this series have consistently featured scholarship that is rigorous and often groundbreaking. These Volumes seven and eight are no exception.\n\nPart 4:\n\nChristopher Buck\n\nA. Symbol and Secret: Qur'an Commentary in BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's KitÃ¡b-i ÃqÃ¡n (Studies in the BÃ¡bÃ­ and BahÃ¡'Ã­ Religions, volume 7) by Christopher Buck, is an examination of the central theological work of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ religion and its relation to pre-existing Islamic theologies and literary forms.(2) Written circa 1862, shortly before BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h first announced to his followers that he was the \"one who God shall make manifest\" foretold by the BÃ¡b, the \"ÃqÃ¡n\" is ostensibly an extended defense of the mission of the BÃ¡b. For BahÃ¡'Ã­s, though, it came to be seen as a defense of and theological exposition on both Babism and the BahÃ¡'Ã­ religion, and it bridges and coordinates the two religions. Further, it is regarded as BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's masterpiece of theological interpretation and exposition. To adduce proofs of the BÃ¡b's prophethood and refute objections to it, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h develops a coherent hermeneutic of creative scriptural interpretation, an explanation of which is unfortunately beyond the scope of this review.\n\nThe title of the book derives from its two main areas of focus. Buck first examines the \"symbol\" by relating BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's hermeneutical enterprise in the ÃqÃ¡n to the well-established traditions of tafsir, Qur'anic interpretation. He demonstrates that, since the ÃqÃ¡n can be seen as residing withinâthough transcending and reshapingâa tradition of Islamic works of exegesis, it is itself an example of Qur'anic exegesis. Much of the value of this examination lies in the fact that comparative studies between Islam and the BahÃ¡'Ã­ religion have yet to be undertaken. Such studies are crucial, for it is only through investigations into Islam that certain metaphors and symbols, technical terms, and cultural assumptions in the earlier BahÃ¡'Ã­ scriptures can be understood. Second, Buck examines the \"secret\" by exploring the theological underpinnings of the ÃqÃ¡n. What was BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's \"messianic consciousness\" at the time of its writing, asks Buck, and to what extent was he disclosing his own secret: that he himself was the promised \"Manifestation\"? Here Buck is on unexplored territory, for this topic has barely been addressed in published BahÃ¡'Ã­ studies. Along the way the book touches on many other issues, such as the manuscript and publication history of the ÃqÃ¡n, ShÃ`Ã notions of the Mahdi, and BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's agenda of social and religious reform.\n\nB. Much of Buck's work in this book is to be commended. His examination is groundbreakingâhe broaches topics vital and yet often ignored. The background work on the history of the ÃqÃ¡n which precedes his main topics is conducted with a depth and assiduousness that could be regarded as a model for future work by scholars of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ religion. He examines the publication history of the ÃqÃ¡n, the dating and dissemination of other key BahÃ¡'Ã­ texts, offers solutions to certain historical dilemmas, and responds to critical charges made by early opponents of the religion with a diligence and concentration which offers great promise for the rest of the book to follow.\n\nThe heart of Buck's project is a demonstration that BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's agenda in the ÃqÃ¡n is prosecuted through innovative tafsÃr. Buck examines many types of exegetical innovation pioneered by BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h. These include the \"interscriptural exegesis,\" i.e. explaining the symbolism in the scripture of one religion through recourse to the scripture of another religion, and the appeal to rationality, i.e. demonstrating the absurdity of literalism. Through these, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h prepares the reader of the ÃqÃ¡n to transcend traditional interpretation and become more receptive to a new revelation. Finally, Buck adapts the tafsÃr typology of Islamicist John Wansbrough to prepare a hermeneutical typology of the ÃqÃ¡n. This section is among the most focused published examinations of BahÃ¡'Ã­ scripture and, even if a reader might disagree with some of Buck's analyses, the endeavour itself is to be applauded.\n\nC. Symbol and Secret's conclusion extrapolates from the above discussions of Islamic context and content in the writings of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h into the realm of BahÃ¡'Ã­ theology. Here Buck examines the implications of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's exegetically-founded break from Islam for issues such as post- Qur'anic revelation, religious and social reform, and metaphorical approaches to scripture. This chapter contains some of the most enlightening and useful discussion in the book, and Buck quite successfully conveys the sense of urgency and potency infusing the ÃqÃ¡n and the state of the early BahÃ¡'Ã­ community. Given the importance of the topics Buck addresses and the skill with which he examines them, it is regrettable that some readers might find Symbol and Secret impenetrable. The two main obstacles in approaching this work are the opacity of Buck's prose and the occasional disorderliness of the book's content.\n\nBuck's writing can in places read as an unsuccessful juxtaposition of poetic and academic styles. His use of metaphors, while colorful, can be distracting. His fondness for polysyllabic alliteration, as in \"vituperative vaticination\" (84) or \"extraordinary extemporaneity,\" (294) can bog down the reader or, worse, bemuse him. As well, he often opts for technicality over clarity. Why \"variae lectiones,\" (139) when \"variant readings\" carries exactly the same semantic value? A more problematic aspect of Symbol and Secret is its somewhat chaotic form. It lacks coherence both in formatting and in content, giving the impression that it was composed in numerous parts which were combined into a somewhat haphazard whole for publication. Its inconsistent use of italics and diacritics might be no more than an occasional distraction, but does indicate a certain lack of editingâas do the few dozen typographical errors occurring throughout the book. The topics examined in the text can be jumbled, with unrelated sentences, paragraphs, and whole sections inserted in the middle of otherwise succinct presentations. Conversely, topics that should be presented coherently can be found scattered across the book. One further wonders what organization guided the layout of Symbol and Secret when the book ends, not with a tight summary of ground covered, but a discussion of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's agenda of socio-religious reform which does not bear direct relevance to the preceding book and reads more as the introduction to a new, unrelated book.\n\nD.These criticisms aside, Buck has undertaken a project that is to be commended on many fronts. This study is daring in that it is the first extended analysis of the Islamic context and content of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's thought and writings. The rigour with which Buck has treated his topics is a model for anyone engaging in textual scholarship: his research is broad, his attention to detail thorough, and his coverage of the topics exhaustive. Finally, many of his conclusions, the light he throws on the ÃqÃ¡n and its content, and in places even his methods are frankly brilliant. Though Symbol and Secret can be a frustrating text which is difficult to penetrate, it is a good study which will well repay the diligent reader.\n\nPart 5:\n\nJack McLean\n\nThe seven essays of Revisioning the Sacred: New Perspectives on a BahÃ¡'Ã­ Theology (Studies in the BÃ¡bÃ­ and BahÃ¡'Ã­ Religions, volume 8), edited by Jack McLean, cover a variety of topics on BahÃ¡'Ã­ theology. While the wide range of style and content of these essays could, in a more established discipline, indicate poor editing or an unfocused mandate, here they demonstrate the richness and potential of this nascent field.\n\nBahÃ¡'Ã­ theology is currently a tentative subject. It faces the expected obstacles confronting such a new and relatively unexplored field, such as a lack of scholastic tradition to build upon, little or no recognition and support from its faith community and institutions, and the difficulty"
