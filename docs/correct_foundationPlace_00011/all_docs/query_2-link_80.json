Have an account? .\n\nWhen David Filo and Jerry Yang created Yahoo in 1995, it was nothing more than a simple list of links. But for early internet users, it was a guide to the open web and new websites clamored to be featured on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, fast-forward more than 20 years, and Verizon is acquiring it for $4.8 billion.\n\nThanks to The Internet Archive, we can revisit the early days and see exactly what Yahoo used to look like.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nTake a trip down memory lane...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJerry Yang and David Filo created Yahoo back in January 1994 while studying at Stanford University. They renamed it \"Yahoo!\" in March.\n\nBy 1996 the site looked like this. The company had its initial public offering in April of that year, closing at $33, up 270% from its IPO price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who was growing up in the 90s may remember \"Yahooligans,\" the company's \"web guide for kids.\"\n\nOr, for an older crowd, its Seniors' Guide, which launched in 1998.\n\nHere's the press release Yahoo published at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe site's homepage still looked pretty much the same by 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2005 was a busy year. Yahoo acquired five companies and made its fateful investment in Chinese ecommerce Alibaba, which would buoy its stock significantly down the line. Its site got a new look too.\n\nHere's how the homepage looked in 2011. In the previous six years, Yahoo had gone through three CEOs. Cofounder Jerry Yang replaced Semel in 2007, but stepped down in only 18 months. Carol Bartz started in January 2009 but was fired by September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 2012, Marissa Mayer took the reins.\n\nIn 2013, the site launched a significant design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncluding a new logo later that year.\n\nFinally, here's what Yahoo.com looks like today.\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
