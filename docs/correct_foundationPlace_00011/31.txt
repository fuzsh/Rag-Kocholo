Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang is set to return to Stanford as a member of the board of trustees.

The board recently elected Yang and Felix Baker, a managing partner of Baker Brothers Investments for five-year terms to start October 1.

“Our board will benefit greatly from their expertise and experience,” said Jeff Raikes, who in July became chair of the board.

The board, which caps out at 38 members, has broad power to control the university, administering invested funds, setting annual budgets, setting policy around how the school operates and appointing the university president, currently Marc Tessier-Lavigne. Last year, the school’s operations budget approached $6 billion, and the university has an endowment of more than $22 billion, one of the largest in the country.

Both men earned undergraduate and graduate degrees at the university and have been involved with the school as alumni. Baker sits on an advisory council that oversees several biosciences institutes at Stanford, while Yang is a member of advisory boards for the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program and the Cantor Arts Center. This will not be his first turn as a member of the board of trustees: Yang sat on the board from 2005 to 2015.
