Verizon’s $4.83 billion acquisition of Yahoo’s core business, announced today, marks the end of Yahoo’s 22-year run as an independent company.

In January 1994, Stanford University graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo created a hierarchically-organized directory of websites imaginatively called “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.”

They renamed the site to Yahoo in April, taking the name from the race of rude, coarse and unpleasant beings in Jonathan Swift’s novel Gulliver’s Travels, though they also came up with a way for it to serve as an acronym — “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.”

The exclamation point was later added to strengthen the trademark.

The site rapidly gained popularity, earning two rounds of venture capital funding before its initial public offering in 1996.

Yahoo! grew to become one of the top web portals, acquiring email, gaming and messaging services and surviving the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

As the internet evolved through the late ‘90s and early 2000s, so did the Yahoo! homepage, which was for millions of people the entry point into the World Wide Web.
