        "text": "What is Mercury banking?\n\nWhile some may refer to Mercury as âMercury Bank,â Mercury is a fintech company, not a bank. Founded in the Bay Area in 2017, Mercury provides a technology platform, and their financial services are offered by its two partner banks, Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust, Members FDIC.Â\n\nMercuryâs platform offers basic banking products and services tailored to venture capital-backed tech startups. The company offers Mercury business checking and savings accounts, corporate credit cards, treasury services, venture debt, and bill payment.\n\nThe company also recently launched Mercury Personal, a subscription-based platform that provides personal banking services including checking, savings, and FDIC-insured deposits. There is currently a waitlist and access to the platform is limited.\n\nMercury for business banking\n\nMercury can handle business basics, including checking accounts, credit cards, and payments by ACH, wire, or check. The platform also provides advanced tools, including treasury and venture debt services.\n\nMercury banking features\n\nHere is an overview of Mercury's offerings.\n\n1. Business banking services\n\nChoice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust, Member FDIC, provide banking services, including checking and savings deposits.Â\n\nThere are no account minimums, overdraft fees, monthly fees, or account opening fees to open a Mercury checking or savings account. Customers can deposit checks, use virtual debit cards, and complete other banking transactions.\n\nNote: Funds held in a Mercury checking and savings account are eligible for up to $5M in FDIC insurance through sweep networks â an offering Mercury sometimes refers to as Mercury Vault.Â â\n\n2. Corporate credit cards\n\nIn addition to debit cards, the Mercury business credit card â the IO Mastercard â is available for businesses that maintain at least $25K in a Mercury account. Credit limits are based on cash underwriting, so changes in your Mercury account balance could impact your limit.\n\nIO is a charge card, so customers must pay off the full balance of each pay period. Your pay period may be daily or monthly, depending on the balance in your Mercury account.\n\n3. Mercury Treasury\n\nThis offering invests funds into âlower-risk mutual fundsâ via Mercuryâs partner, Apex Clearing Corp. The idea is that startups with more than $5M in deposits can put those funds to work to earn yield.Â Â\n\nHowever, keep a few things in mind:Â\n\nIt will take several business days to withdraw funds from Mercury Treasury.\n\nMoney market funds have some disadvantages compared to investing in T-Bills directly.\n\nThe FDIC does not insure Mercury Treasury.Â\n\nMercury Treasury is only available to users with account balances over $500K.Â\n\nCustomers have access to mutual funds offered by Morgan Stanley and Vanguard. Mutual fund investment balances are insured by SIPC and not by the FDIC.â\n\n4. Mercury Venture Debt\n\nMercury lends to VC-funded companies across stages and industries, and VC firms use venture debt to extend cash runway with minimal dilution. Borrowers can request withdrawals and confirm the remaining capital balance in a few clicks.\n\nMercury loan agreements allow borrowers to withdraw any time during the interest-only period, which can span up to 18 months. After that, firms have a loan payback period of up to 48Â months.Â\n\nFounders may apply to refinance and refresh the loan after they raise their next equity round.\n\n5. Financial workflows and accounting integrations\n\nMercury provides some limited integrations with QuickBooks and Xero and offers âNetsuite-friendly reportsâ â or CSV exports of transactions for reconciliation purposes. The company offers also Bill Pay services linked to the Mercury banking platform.\n\nMercury's recently launched financial workflows are free to try until August 1st, 2024. Mercury customers must select one of these four pricing tiers after August 1st:\n\nCore: No monthly fee. No enriched accounting automation for NetSuite. Bill Pay is limited to five bills per month.\n\nPlus: $35 monthly fee. No enriched accounting automation for NetSuite. Bill Pay is limited to 20 bills per month, and $2 for each additional bill.\n\nPro: $350 monthly fee includes a dedicated relationship manager. Enriched accounting automation for NetSuite is included. Bill Pay is limited to 250 bills per month, and $1 for each additional bill.â\n\nEnterprise: Businesses must contact a Mercury salesperson for the monthly fee and pricing related to bill pay. Includes a dedicated relationship manager.\n\nWho is Mercury for?\n\nLike Rho, Mercury is a go-to starting banking solution for many VC-backed startups.\n\nCustomers with more than $250,000 in deposits who want a sweep account to increase FDIC insurance coverage may fit Mercury. Mercury is also a consideration for businesses that want access to venture funding.\n\nHowever, as growth-stage startups scale, they may need additional capabilities like multi-entity support, AP automation, and other important financial operations features.Â Mercuryâs AP automation platform has limitations, and the service can be expensive.\n\nOur Mercury banking review\n\nMany VC firms reevaluated their FDIC deposit insurance risks after the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis in March of 2023.Â\n\nFounders need to understand clearly how much FDIC insurance protection they have, the cost of business banking, and how quickly they can access cash balances.\n\nSaaS startup Superfiliate is disrupting affiliate marketing in e-commerce. Discover why their co-founder transitioned from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to Rho.\n\nMercury pros\n\nLow fee structure: Mercury does not charge annual fees or account fees. There are no fees for Global ACH, wire transfers, or additional credit cards. The Financial Workflows services may include fees.\n\nMercury Vault solution: Mercury Vault provides up to $5 million in FDIC insurance through partner banks and sweep networks. Businesses with large bank balances can spread deposits between multiple banks and get FDIC insurance coverage.\n\nSmooth user experience: Many Mercury customers are satisfied with integrating payments, spend management, corporate cards, and other features into a single platform.\n\nMercury cons\n\nNo cash deposits: Mercury does not support cash deposits, unlike many online business checking accounts. Mercury is not an option for companies that process customer payments in cash.Â\n\nWithdrawing Mercury Treasury funds: Mercury Treasury withdrawals typically take 1-2 business days to post to your account, but transfers can take up to 5 business days. These delays in processing may create cash flow management issues.\n\nMoney market funds vs. T-Bills: Unlike Rho Prime Treasury, which invests client funds in T-Bills held directly in their name, Mercury Treasury funds are invested in money market funds.\n\nRisks of using venture debt: Lenders put terms and conditions in place to ensure prompt loan repayment when due, and loan covenants may restrict how the founders can operate the business while the loan is outstanding. Venture debt is a secured debt, and defaulting on a secured loan will require the founder to give up company assets, which may disrupt or end business operations.\n\nPoint-solution for cash management: Mercury lacks multi-entity support, and additional finance capabilities startups may want to integrate with banking, including fully-integrated AP automation and expense management.Â\n\nIf you use multiple software solutions for banking and finance, your software costs and transaction fees can rise quickly. For example, standalone AP automation, expense tracking, and cash management tools can be expensive and have hidden integration costs with accounting software or bookkeeping platforms like QuickBooks.\n\nManaging multiple financial platforms can also place a strenuous burden on your already time-strapped team. A disjointed finance stack increases the risk of errors and makes understanding how your business operates difficult.\n\nStartup founders must balance the need for high-yield earnings on excess cash with investment risks.\n\nMercury banking fees\n\nBusiness banking: Mercury charges a 1% fee on currency exchange. The foreign exchange fee covers costs incurred by non-USD international wires. Mercury also charges fees for making mass payments on the companyâs API and fees to send USD internationally with optional premium processing.\n\nMercury Treasury: There are no fees to open an account or to process transactions. Mercury charges a percentage fee based on assets held in Mercury Treasury. The percentage fee you charge is determined by the total deposits held across all Mercury accounts (checking, Treasury, etc.) The minimum charge is a 0.05% annual fee.\n\nMercury Financial Workflows: As explained earlier, this platform offers four pricing tiers, ranging from a free version to monthly fees costing hundreds of dollars.Â\n\nMercury Personal: Customers pay a $240 annual subscription for Mercuryâs personal banking services. There is currently a waitlist to access Mercury Personal.\n\nMercury customer service\n\nMercury clients must use email for customer support. Phone support is not offered, chat support is unavailable on weekends, and reviews indicate customers need help with customer support responsiveness.Â\n\nCorporate checking account interest rates\n\nMercuryâs business checking account doesn't earn interest. Mercury customers with more than $500,000 balances can apply for Mercury Treasury to earn higher yields on excess cash.\n\nMercury banking alternatives and comparisons\n\n1.

These charges can quickly add up if you have a high invoice volume.Â\n\nCustomer support: While Ramp claims to offer call, chat, and phone support on their website, âpremium supportâ and âdedicated account managementâ are Ramp Plus and Ramp Enterprise features.Â\n\nPricing\n\nSome of Rampâs basic features are free to use. However, many automation features are now paywalled behind Ramp Plus and Ramp Enterprise plans, including ERP integrations, purchase order management, and premium customer support.Â\n\nAs of this articleâs publishing date, Ramp Plus is $12 per user per month (when billed yearly; $15 per month otherwise).Â\n\nHowever, larger enterprise organizations must contact Ramp Sales for a more specific quote if they want important features like multi-entity support.Â\n\nBest for\n\nRamp is a viable alternative for businesses with manual expense and payment processes or using outdated tools like Concur or BILL that cause problems, such as expense receipt submission and invoice payment delays.Â\n\nRamp vs. Mercury\n\nRamp offers corporate card, expense management, and spend management product capabilities.

Mercury provides tools for these cash management tasks:\n\nManaging bank deposit accounts: Managing bank account balances and determining the amount of excess cash not needed for company operations.\n\nFunding investments: Moving excess cash in and out of an investment account to maximize the yield earned on a cash position. Treasury management invests excess cash in short-term investments, including treasury bills.\n\nEffective cash management also includes cash flow forecasting and monitoring receivables. Mercury does not provide financial tools for these tasks.\n\nCan you deposit cash into a Mercury banking account?\n\nMercury customers cannot deposit cash, and the platform is not part of a fee-free ATM network\n\nIs Mercury a good business banking platform?\n\nMercury is great for startup businesses that want access to business banking services built into a technology platform with a good user experience.Â\n\nCustomers with more than $250,000 in deposits who want a sweep account to increase FDIC insurance coverage may be a fit for Mercury.

When multiple banks are used for deposits, Mercury customers get FDIC insurance through multiple institutions. Mercury customers are eligible for up to $5 million in total FDIC insurance coverage.\n\nMercury Vault monitors balances and prompts the movement of funds when a single bank account balance is higher than the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit.\n\nMercury Treasury investments\n\nMercury customers can invest excess cash to earn a higher yield. Clients can invest in the Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund, which invests 99.5% of assets in US government-backed securities.\n\nInvestors can also choose the Morgan Stanley Ultra-Short Income Portfolio. Both funds provide up to $500,000 in SIPC insurance. Customers with account balances over $25 million can get access to Morgan Stanleyâs fixed-income portfolio management team.Â\n\nAs mentioned above, money market fund risk and rewards differ from investing directly in U.S. Treasuries held in your name.\n\nWhen a customer opens a Mercury Treasury account, Apex Clearing Corporation, a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, opens an account in the customerâs name. Funds are held in custody at Apex, not at Mercury.\n\nHow does Mercury make money?\n\nMercury makes money in six different ways:\n\nInterest earned on checking deposits in Mercury bank accounts\n\nMerchant fees (interchange fees) are paid by merchants when customers use an IO card or a Mercury debit card\n\nEarnings on foreign exchange processing on international wires\n\nCustomer fees paid by Mercury Treasury customers\n\nOrigination fees and interest earned on Mercury Venture Debt transactions\n\nCustomer fees paid by Mercury Financial Workflows and Mercury Personal users\n\nHow long does it take to open a Mercury banking account?\n\nMercury will make a decision on your bank account application typically within 1-2 business days.\n\nFounders who are interested in Mercury complete an online application.
