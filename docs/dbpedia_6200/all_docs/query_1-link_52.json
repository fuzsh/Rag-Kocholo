        "text": "Last month, OpenText entered an agreement to purchase Micro Focus in a $6bn deal. The deal is expected to complete sometime in early 2023, marking another stage in the ownership of the former Mercury Interactive/HP test tools suite.\n\nWith a combined turnover of over $6.2bn, this will make them one of the largest software companies in the world, placing them in the top 20 global software companies.\n\nWhat does this deal mean for you?\n\nIn short, Calleo doesn’t anticipate any impact on the current Micro Focus product portfolio, which includes the following leading test tools:\n\nQuality Center ALM\n\nOctane/Value Edge\n\nUFT (Developer, One, and Mobile)\n\nLoadRunner (Developer, Cloud, Professional, and Enterprise)\n\nService Virtualization\n\nWhether you’re a current user, or interested in any of these tools, we expect no disruption whatsoever. The test tools are as rock-solid as it has ever been, today and into the future.\n\nAfter all, this is by no means the first time these test tools have passed to new ownership…\n\nOwnership Has Changed Multiple Times – And Never Affected Quality\n\nThese test tools have an incredibly long and successful history. Many of them were initially developed by Mercury Interactive and can trace their roots back to the 1990s.\n\nThey first changed ownership in 2006, when Mercury was acquired by Hewlett-Packard. They were then spun off as part of HPE in 2015 when HP split into two separate companies. Ownership changed again in 2017 when HPE itself was acquired by Micro Focus.\n\nSuffice to say, these test tools have a long and varied ownership history. However, throughout that time they have continued to thrive and are still the benchmark that all other test tools measure themselves against.\n\nThe Tools Have Stood The Test of Time\n\nUFT for example started life as Astra QuickTest, which was released in 1998. That’s a staggering 24 years of history and quite remarkable when you consider how quickly technology and software have progressed in the intervening years.\n\nTo give that timeframe a bit more context, 1998 was also the year that:\n\nMySQL was introduced\n\nGoogle filed for incorporation\n\nIE overtook Netscape as the world’s most popular browser\n\n24 years later and UFT is still the world’s leading Software Test Automation tool. It can automate more applications than any other test tool and is used across all industry sectors, including major banks, manufacturers, retail, and pharma.\n\nWhy The Micro Focus Test Tool Suite is so Important\n\nThe Tools continue to be important because they’re the best out there. Time and time again, they have evolved with technology. Year on year, they’ve moved with the times, developed new solutions and improved existing offerings.\n\nOver the decades, The Micro Focus test tools suite has seen many competitors come, and often go quite quickly. Tools like the Rational suite were much hyped, but just couldn’t compete with the usability and functionality provided by the Micro Focus suite.\n\nEven today, there are many other options in the market. A lot of niche players and smaller vendors – Tricentis or JMeter for example – try to muscle in on the space, but just don’t have the same levels of capability and excellence provided by the Micro Focus Tools.\n\nThe Tools That Set The Benchmark\n\nAfter all this time, and multiple changes of ownership, The Micro Focus suite continues to set the benchmark for test tools.\n\nThey lead the way in functionality, they have a tool or feature for everything you’ll need. They also offer the greatest protocol and application support\n\nMicro Focus tools can test a wider range of solutions than any other. They’ve also been around so long that there’s no shortage of skilled practitioners to maximise their value.\n\nIf you are interested to know about the latest tools, please get in touch today!"
