        "text": "Since building our waste water treatment facility in 1931, we've changed a lot more than the name. We've worked hard to restore the quality and reputation of the Grand River, our most precious resource.\n\nWe treat 40 million gallons of waste water every day and keep all untreated sewage out of the river. And we use state-of-the-art technology to do it in the most sustainable way possible.\n\nMore About Wastewater\n\nWater Resources — Utility of the Future\n\nWe are a clean water utility leading towards resource recovery, improved operational efficiency, and sustainability to support a safe, healthy, thriving community, environment, and economy.\n\nManaging the Waste We Produce Every Day\n\nThe Water Resource Recovery Facility treats an average of 40 million gallons of water daily. That's equivalent to 100,000 bathtubs!\n\nResource Recovery\n\nWe’re capturing valuable resources that would otherwise be lost. Methane produced by the anaerobic digester is captured and turned into renewable natural gas. A combined heat and power system produces thermal energy to heat the digester tanks and provides electricity to power the facility.\n\nProtecting Our Natural Resources\n\nGrand Rapids values its water resources above all else. By cleaning wastewater and recovering resources at our facility, we are doing our part to keep the Grand River and our watersheds clean for all to enjoy.\n\nDownload our brochure to learn about the Biodigestion Process and the benefits of using Biogas.\n\nDownload the Brochure(PDF, 3MB)\n\nIf you are interested in seeing the Biodigestion Process first-hand, schedule a tour of the Water Resource Recovery Facility.\n\nSchedule a Tour\n\nOur Environmental Services team is continuing to work on our PFAS evaluation plan, which has been approved by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. This work includes identifying and monitoring potential PFAS sources coming into our Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF). A PFAS pollutant reduction plan is similar to the mercury minimization plan that has been successful over time and has been part of our WRRF program for more than 20 years. We’re committed to pollution reduction and we’re working with confirmed sources to reduce this pollutant in our environment. Our potential and identified sources are collaborative and cooperative.\n\nThese sources impact the WRRF’s treated discharge water to the Grand River – not drinking water. Wastewater sampling at the WRRF is taking place on a monthly basis, and we’re working with identified sources to continue monitoring for PFAS. As with all sewage and pollutant discharges, including domestic use, we continue to reduce and eliminate wastewater as a source of harm to the environment. We continue to work collaboratively with our sewer users, regulating bodies, national membership associations, universities, research foundations and other partners to work on long-term cost-effective treatment solutions.\n\nThe work to reduce PFAS pollutants is expected to take many years, and fully understanding the pervasiveness of PFAS compounds in the environment is still being studied. PFAS is a long-term environmental cleanup, and we’re confident that knowledge, technology and treatment options will continue to improve and be successful. The WRRF’s industrial pretreatment program continues to be a state leader in PFAS evaluation.\n\nCheck out a PFAS destruction technology we’re working to help bring to a bigger scale: https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/diamond-technology-cleans-up-pfas-contaminated-wastewater/.\n\nFor information on the high-quality and safe drinking water provided by our Water System, visit https://www.grandrapidsmi.gov/Government/Departments/Water-System.\n\nWe rely on experts to guide our operations and decision making. These groups review and give feedback on our operations.\n\nStormwater Oversight Commission\n\nThis commission reviews the City's stormwater system. It also makes recommendations for improvement to the City government. Here's a look at the commission's duties:\n\nReviews the current state of the City's stormwater system\n\nReports on stormwater\n\nLook over expenditures and makes recommendations to the City Manager and Commission\n\nStormwater Oversight Commission Documents\n\nMore About the Commission\n\nGrand Valley Regional Biosolids Authority\n\nWe provide leadership in a regional biosolids management program. Our program is sustainable, innovative, and captures the value of biosolids.\n\nWe manage biosolids processing, handling, and re-use. We do this in a diversified manner to benefit the economy, the environment, and society as a whole.\n\nMore About the Authority\n\nUtility Advisory Board\n\nThe Utility Advisory Board is a regional partnership. Grand Rapids provides water and sewer services to other cities, townships, and other municipalities.\n\nUtility Advisory Board Meeting Schedule\n\nUtility Advisory Board Documents"
