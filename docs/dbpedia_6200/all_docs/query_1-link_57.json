        "text": "RA-915M\n\nRA-915M is a supersensitive and highly selective portable analyzer that allows real-time mercury measurement in ambient and indoor air. Being combined with dedicated attachments, the analyzer is used for mercury determination in solid and liquid samples, biological materials, and various gases. RA-915M-based sets can be used in stationary and field laboratories. RA-915M is used for background air monitoring, mercury surveys including continuous measurements from vehicles, indoor and outdoor pollution detection and mapping, demercurization control, occupational health and safety, geochemical exploration, etc. Direct air mercury measurement complies with EN 15852 standard.\n\nMore info\n\nRA-915F\n\nThis simple benchtop mercury analyzer allows fast direct Hg measurement in all kinds of solid, liquid, and biological samples starting from ppb level. Even the complex-matrix samples are analyzed ‘as it is’ without pre-treatment.\n\nMore info\n\nRA-915M / PYRO-915+\n\nRA-915M with PYRO-915+ attachment is a versatile tool for fast direct analysis of all kinds of solid, liquid, and biological samples from ppb level. Even the complex-matrix samples are analyzed ‘as is’ without pre-treatment. No reagents or compressed gases are required. The routine analysis takes 1–2 min.\n\nMore info\n\nRA-915 Lab\n\nRA-915 Lab is the new direct fully automated laboratory mercury analyzer with 45 position autosampler. It provides accurate, reliable and cost-effective measurements in the broadest range of applications areas. The instrument analyzes solid, semisolid, and liquid samples with no pretreatment, reagents and almost no wastes.\n\nRA-915 Lab can be supplied without autosampler.\n\nMore info\n\nRA-915M / RP-92\n\nRA-915M mercury analyzer with RP-92 attachment is used for determination of mercury concentration in liquid samples (water, blood, urine). RP-92 attachment is intended to transfer bound Hg from ion to atomic form using “cold vapor” technique.\n\nMore info\n\nLight-915M2\n\nLight-915M2 is a compact, portable mercury analyzer designed for convenient direct Hg measurement in air. High accuracy and real-time operation along with small size and weight make it an excellent device for field work.\n\nMore info"
