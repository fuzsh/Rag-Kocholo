All benefit from being part of a larger community, whilst retaining their own identity\n\nThis creates a natural environment for knowledge sharing and unlocks a network effect to our businesses with satellite minds that sit around us.\n\nWe are investing in the future, backing businesses that are redefining how industries work.\n\nDriving decades-long trends means maintaining partnerships that span professional lifetimes.\n\nWe have grown businesses from rising stars to international champions worth over $10 billion.\n\nThis doesnâ€™t happen overnight but together we can build a legacy."
