However, this is extremely advisable when deploying Android.\n\nAndroid devices do not come with a common hardware specification, so it is advisable to check compatibility before purchasing.\n\nIf you wish to deploy Appspace on a wide variety of devices using a single OS, then you should consider Android a serious option.\n\nGuides\n\nConfigure Appspace App for Devices on Android\n\nBrightSign\n\nMinimum Certified OS / Firmware Device Series Reference Models Ideal For Content Delivery Mode Appspace App Device Platform Minimum Appspace Version BrightSign OS 9.0.13 BrightSign XC Series 5 XC4055 Digital Signage / Room Scheduling / Kiosks / Enterprise TV Caching via Appspace Downloads Appspace 8.1 BrightSign XT Series 5 XT1145 BrightSign XD Series 5 XD1035 BrightSign HD Series 5 HD1025 BrightSign LS Series 5 LS445 BrightSign OS 8.5.31 BrightSign XT Series 4 XT1144 Appspace 8.0 BrightSign XD Series 3 XD1033 BrightSign 4K Series 2 4K1142 BrightSign OS 8.4.10 BrightSign XD Series 4 XD1034 BrightSign HD Series 4 HD1024 BrightSign XT Series 3 XT1143 XT243 BrightSign OS 8.3.46 BrightSign LS Series 4 LS424 BrightSign XD Series 3 XD233 BrightSign HD Series 3 HD1023 HD223 BrightSign LS Series 3 LS423 BrightSign LS Series 2 LS243\n\nImportant\n\nBrightSign devices running BrightSign OS 8.3.46, requires Appspace App 2.36 or higher.\n\nBefore upgrading BrightSign devices to BrightSign OS 8.5, ensure that Appspace App has been first updated to Appspace App 2.54.2. This is crucial to prevent the local storage from being wiped off due to the architectural changes in the location of the local storage for BrightSign OS 8.\n\nNote\n\nThe BrightSign RC-1001 remote control is only supported via the 3.5mm IR jack on BrightSign devices, and not via the USB IR receivers. However, we do not support the BrightSign RC-1002.\n\nStrengthsChallengesSummaryDevice Limitations\n\nBrightSign develops its own hardware, firmware, and software.\n\nA slim, fan-less design is ideal for even the most challenging environments.\n\nGood 4K video playback performance on the XT4, XT3, and XD3 devices.\n\nThe XT4 devices are designed to support Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for displaying vibrant colors with our App’s HTML5 engine.\n\nGood multicast video playback on all BrightSign devices.\n\nPower over Ethernet (PoE) support on XT4 and XT3 devices.\n\nA range of devices to meet different performance and configuration requirements.\n\nOPS module provides slot-in compatibility with several leading manufacturers’ display products (e.g., NEC).\n\nProprietary device management platform available from BrightSign, offering additional hardware management tools.\n\nIdeal for both cloud and on-prem Appspace deployments.\n\nA microSD card must be purchased separately for each BrightSign device. BrightSign is working on a solution for Appspace customers.\n\nTo display text on top of video requires some workarounds; you must add the Custom.media.video.layerindex property to your device.\n\nThe LS Series 3 models are rather low-power devices, and therefore it is recommended to use only simple images and cards without animation, with transitions disabled.\n\nBrightSign devices are purpose-built for digital signage and kiosks. The company’s Series 4 redesign shows its commitment to customer experience and reliability.\n\nThe RSS Ticker animation stutters when displayed on BrightSign devices due to technical limitations, caused by iframe loading issues.\n\nOn BrightSign 9.0 devices, videos that have been configured to be displayed in Portrait are being displayed in Landscape due to a bug. Appspace has already begun working on this, and a fix will be available in a future release.\n\nGuides\n\nConfigure Appspace for Devices App on BrightSign\n\nConfigure Appspace App on BrightSign with BSN.cloud\n\nChrome OS\n\nMinimum Certified OS / Firmware Device Series Reference Models Ideal For Content Delivery Mode Appspace App Device Platform Minimum Appspace Version ChromeOS LTS 120 AOpen Chromeboxes AOpen Chromebox Commercial Digital Signage / Room Scheduling / Kiosks / Enterprise TV Caching via Chrome Web Store Appspace 8.0 AOpen Chromebox Commercial 2 AOpen Chromebases AOpen Chromebase Commercial Asus Chrome OS Asus Chromebox CN60 Asus Chromebit CS10 Asus Google Meet Compute System (Intel 10th Gen) Wallpaper / Screensavers Streaming via Appspace PWA URL Appspace 8.1\n\nImportant\n\nAppspace currently only supports issues arising from managed Chrome-based devices, thus we recommend Google Chrome Enterprise, previously Chrome Device Management (CDM), to manage your Chrome-based devices.\n\nStrengthsChallengesSummaryDevice Limitations\n\nIndustry-leading HTML5 compatibility.\n\nGoogle Chrome Device Manager (CDM) for large-scale deployments.\n\nClass-leading browser, resulting in high reliability\n\nStrong performance for h.264/MP4 video formats.\n\nConfiguration for single-app/kiosk mode.\n\nA great option for cloud deployments.\n\nLimited video format support (e.g., no multicast support, no support for video formats other than .mp4 h.264).\n\nSupport for RS232 and PoE on limited devices.\n\nCDM licenses required at a fee.\n\nChrome OS sets the standard for HTML5 compatibility. Chrome devices are highly compatible with Appspace features and functions. However, performance may vary depending on hardware specifications (i.e., a Chromebit is ideal for basic signage deployments; but for more rigorous performance requirements, a Chromebox or Chromebox Commercial is the way to go).\n\nGuides\n\nConfigure Appspace for Devices App on Chrome OS\n\nConfigure Chrome OS Devices with Chrome Enterprise (CDM)\n\nConfigure Wallpaper/Screensaver for Google Meet Devices\n\niOS\n\nMinimum Certified OS / Firmware Device Series Reference Models Ideal For Content Delivery Mode Appspace App Device Platform Minimum Appspace Version iOS 17 Apple iPad iPad 10th Gen Digital Signage / Room Scheduling / Kiosks / Enterprise TV Caching via Apple App Store Appspace 8.6 iOS 16 iPad Air 2 Appspace 8.0 iPad 6th Gen\n\nStrengthsChallengesSummaryDevice Limitations\n\nApple develops its own hardware, firmware, and software.\n\nThe Appspace app can run as a standard app that is launched by the user, or in single app/kiosk mode.\n\nExcellent single app experience on tablets.\n\nIdeal for both cloud and on-prem Appspace deployments.\n\nRequires an MDM (Mobile Device Management) software.

As it comes pre-built into these devices, the Appspace App functionality may be limited to only certain features, such as:\n\nBasic wallpaper or signage displays using Appspace on room conferencing devices that are idle.\n\nBasic wallpaper or signage displays using Appspace Lite, on the vendor’s device management portal.\n\nRoom scheduling with Appspace cards on purpose-built room scheduling devices or smart signboards.\n\nContent from Appspace is usually streamed on these devices, and not stored locally due to functional limitations on the device.\n\nAppspace Built-In\n\nCisco Webex and Collaboration Endpoints (CE)\n\nMinimum Certified OS / Firmware Device Series Reference Models Ideal For Content Delivery Mode Appspace App Device Platform Minimum Appspace Version Webex Share OS / novum1.1.0 Cisco Webex Room series Webex Share Wallpaper Caching Preinstalled on Device Appspace 8.0 Novum OS / novum1.1.0 Cisco Webex Room series Webex Room Phone Webex RoomOS Cisco Webex Board series Board 55 Signage Mode Board 70 Board 85s CE 9.4 or later (on CUCM) / latest Cisco Webex RoomOS (on Webex Cloud) Cisco Webex Room series Room 55 Signage Mode via Appspace PWA URL / Appspace Lite Room 70 Room Kit Room Kit Mini Room Kit Plus Room Kit Pro Cisco CE Desk series DX80 Wallpaper Preinstalled on Device / Appspace Lite Cisco CE TelePresence MX series MX200 Wallpaper Preinstalled on Device MX300 MX700 MX800 Cisco CE TelePresence SX series SX20 Wallpaper Preinstalled on Device SX80 Cisco Webex Room Peripherals Webex Room Navigator Signage Mode via Appspace PWA URL / Appspace Lite Appspace 8.1\n\nStrengthsChallengesSummaryDevice Limitations\n\nThe Collaboration Endpoint devices are already in place as they are used for video conferencing. The Appspace integrations bring additional features to existing infrastructure to enhance corporate communication.\n\nThe Appspace integrations do not interfere with Cisco functionality.\n\nAppspace does not just change the wallpaper but provides the end-user with a lot of the features that are traditionally available only on digital signage devices, like the ability to schedule content, use Alerts and create good-looking content by leveraging Appspace Cards.\n\nTo make it easier for Cisco device administrators to access Appspace content, Appspace and Cisco are offering another integration, which will enable Cisco users to access the Appspace content management system directly via the Webex Control Hub, to display engaging digital signage and/or interactive content when the device is not in use as a videoconferencing tool.\n\nConstantly streaming content may increase bandwidth usage. Check out our Managing Bandwidth in Appspace guide for help.\n\nCurrently, the Collaboration Endpoint device integration requires an external Appspace App supported device, known as a caching device, which is responsible for uploading the content to the endpoints. The caching device needs to access the Appspace Cloud and be on the same local network as the endpoints (for CE 9.8 and earlier only).\n\nMass registration requires a desktop tool developed by Cisco to install the macro (for CE 9.8 and earlier only).\n\nThe Cisco Collaboration Endpoints are purpose-built for conference rooms. The wallpaper is a secondary feature, hence, content should be limited to using images and cards only.
