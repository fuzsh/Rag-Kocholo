One of our specialist areas is the determination of Hg in natural Gas, liquefied gas streams, naphtha, produced water, condensates and crude oil. PS Analytical have worked closely with all the oil and gas majors, the majority of the field testing companies and many of the mercury removal system suppliers. The Sir Galahad instrumentation complies with the latest ISO and ASTM methods for mercury in natural gas; ISO 6978:2 and ASTM 6350. They have also sold many online Hg systems worldwide.\n\nIn addition to this PS Analytical offer a consultancy measurement service and have undertaken numerous projects to validate the performance of mercury removal systems and establish the fate and transportation of Mercury for upstream and downstream operations."
