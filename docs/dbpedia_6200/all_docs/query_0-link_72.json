The Secretariat of the Minamata Convention is committed to enabling events at which everyone can participate in an inclusive, respectful and safe environment. Delegates are invited to familiarize themselves with the document.\n\nGreening the COP*\n\nThe Minamata Convention Secretariat has taken steps to enhance and promote the environmental sustainability of its activities, including in the preparation and conduct of its meetings.\n\nThe fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Minamata Convention (COP-5) will be conducted in accordance with the Secretariat’s environmental sustainability efforts. A number of measures will be put in place to reduce the environmental impact of COP-5 and offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions related to it.\n\nThe Secretariat will work with the Geneva International Conference Centre (CICG) and the caterer to reduce the environmental impact of their services. CICG and the caterer have adopted several measures to reduce their environmental footprint. For more information on the environmental measures taken by CICG, please consult the environmental chart of the Foundation for Buildings for International Organizations (FIPOI).\n\nAll participants have an essential role to play in reducing the environmental footprint of COP-5, and your support in this important effort is greatly appreciated.\n\nSustainability measures that will be adopted at the venue\n\nReducing waste production: COP-5 will aim at reducing wastes, especially plastic waste, at the meeting venue, in collaboration with CICG and the caterer:\n\nThe use of plastic in containers, bottles, sandwich wraps, cutlery and cups will be minimized and replaced with alternatives. Please see below a table of items that will be available at COP-5, and suggested actions to reduce waste production;\n\nParticipants are strongly encouraged to bring refillable drinking containers (cups, mugs, bottles) to be used at the Café/Restaurant and hydration stations located throughout the venue;\n\nA discount on hot drinks will be offered by the caterer at the Café le 6ème Continent (Ground Floor) and at the Restaurant (First Floor) to the participants who use their own reusable cups;\n\nThe venue has a recycling programme, and recycling bins are disposed in various locations throughout the venue.\n\nPaperless meeting: The meeting will be paperless and printed documents will not be available at the meeting. Making a meeting paperless considerably reduces the cost and carbon footprint of the meeting. Pre-session documents will be available on the meeting’s website and in-session documents (such as conference room papers) will be available electronically via the COP-5 webpage. Participants are encouraged to bring laptops or tablets.\n\nSuggested actions for participants to support greening COP-5\n\nParticipants who organize their own travel to and from Geneva are encouraged to take the following actions:\n\nCalculate the CO2 emissions related to their travels, using the ICAO flight emissions calculator;\n\nOffset their emissions, using the United Nations carbon offset platform and sending a copy of the attestation to the Secretariat at mea-minamatameetings [at] un.org to help track progress in achieving climate neutrality of COP-5;\n\nReplace short flights with rail trips, where possible;\n\nOpt for direct routes that avoid additional emissions associated with multiple take-offs and landings;\n\nVoluntarily lower the flight class to avoid the higher footprint of business class trips;\n\nUse sustainable transportation, including buses, biking, walking, or carpooling for local trips where possible;\n\nShift meals to plant-based, locally produced, in-season, or eco-certified alternatives where possible;\n\nSeek out accommodations that have a green guest program or have earned an eco-certification;\n\nStay at accommodations that are within walking distance of the meeting venue;\n\nReduce food waste and other waste;\n\nBring refillable drinking containers (cups, mugs, bottles) to be used at the Café/Restaurant and hydration stations;\n\nDownload any electronic documents for use onsite. Printed copies will not be provided, but participants will be able to recharge their devices;\n\nParticipate in the venue's recycling program.\n\nThe following items will be available at the COP venue.
