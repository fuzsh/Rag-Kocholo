        "text": "Sustainable seafood is wild-caught or farmed seafood that is harvested or produced in ways that protect the long-term health of species populations and ecosystems. The United States is a global leader in sustainable seafood. U.S. fishermen and seafood farmers operate under some of the most robust and transparent environmental standards in the world. If the seafood you purchase is caught or farmed in the United States, you can feel confident you’re making a sustainable seafood choice.\n\nMarine wild-capture fisheries in the United States are scientifically monitored and regionally managed. They are enforced under 10 national standards of sustainability through the Magnuson-Stevens Act—exceeding the international standards for eco-labeling of seafood.\n\nAlthough current U.S. aquaculture production is small and lags behind the rest of the world, U.S. fish farms operate under some of the world’s most robust environmental protections. They produce environmentally safe, sustainable sources of domestic seafood. They also create jobs, support resilient working waterfronts and coastal communities, and provide international trade opportunities.\n\nOur sustainable seafood profiles have up-to-date information on the status of some of the nation’s most valuable marine species harvested in U.S. federal waters. They also have information on U.S. farmed fish that help meet our country’s growing seafood demand.\n\nWatch the video below to get a tour of the new home of FishWatch.\n\nWell-managed wild-capture fisheries and environmentally responsible marine aquaculture play an increasingly important role in our food supply, our health, and the environment. Understanding and achieving a sustainable seafood supply is an ever-evolving journey. We continually monitor our dynamic ocean resources to determine whether overfishing is happening and respond quickly with appropriate measures. This adaptive approach to management fosters responsible wild-capture fisheries. Today, more than 90 percent of the stocks we monitor are not subject to overfishing. By prioritizing sustainability, the U.S. fish farms that were once plagued by environmental issues are now some of the most environmentally efficient food production facilities in the world.\n\nWhat is sustainable seafood?\n\nSustainable seafood is fish, shellfish, and seaweeds harvested or farmed in a manner that provides for today’s needs while allowing species to reproduce, habitats to flourish, and productive ecosystems to be available for future generations.\n\nIt’s also the most environmentally efficient source of protein on the planet. In the United States, wild-caught and farmed fish, shellfish, and seaweeds are managed under a system of enforced environmentally responsible practices. Both sources are essential for ensuring sustainable supplies of seafood for our nation and the world.\n\nIs U.S. seafood sustainable?\n\nYes. U.S. seafood is inherently sustainable due to our robust and dynamic science-based regulatory system. From wild-capture fisheries to farmed fish facilities, the United States is a recognized global leader in sustainable seafood.\n\nU.S. wild-capture marine fisheries are conducted under science-based fishery management plans developed by regional fishery management councils through an open, public process. These plans are developed using the best scientific information available. By law, U.S. seafood must be caught according to fishery management plans that:\n\nConsider social and economic outcomes for fishing communities\n\nPrevent overfishing\n\nRebuild depleted stocks\n\nMinimize bycatch and interactions with protected species\n\nIdentify and conserve essential fish habitat\n\nThrough this process, fish populations are managed to provide for today’s needs while allowing the species to reproduce and be available for future generations. Learn more about wild fisheries management in the United States.\n\nHow does NOAA Fisheries make sure U.S. fisheries are sustainably managed?\n\nU.S. fisheries are scientifically monitored, regionally managed, and legally enforced under 10 national standards of sustainability. Managing sustainable fisheries is a dynamic process. It requires constant attention to new scientific information, so that management actions can adapt to changing ocean conditions.\n\nFishery managers use a variety of scientific information—including stock assessments and species and ecosystem research—to set harvest and operational requirements for each fishery. These requirements support the goals of sustaining fish populations, protecting habitat and other species, and keeping fishermen on the job.\n\nIf a species is overfished, this management system allows for restricted harvest levels to rebuild the stock and keep responsible fishermen on the water and fishing communities at work. You can be assured the U.S. seafood you see at the store is being actively managed for today’s consumers and future generations.\n\nWhat role does aquaculture play in sustainable seafood?\n\nAlthough the sustainability of our domestic wild-capture fisheries continues to improve, we cannot meet increasing domestic demand for seafood through wild-caught fisheries alone. Over the past 30 years, global wild-capture fisheries have plateaued while aquaculture has become the fastest growing form of food production worldwide. The United States produces a relatively small amount of seafood from aquaculture. We rely heavily on foreign aquaculture imports to meet the growing demand for healthy protein.\n\nIt is critical for the United States to expand the aquaculture industry. By growing our seafood locally, we can ensure a safe, secure, and sustainable local seafood supply. Marine aquaculture also creates jobs, supports resilient working waterfronts and coastal communities, and provides new trade opportunities.\n\nLearn more about aquaculture\n\nHow does the United States contribute to sustainable fisheries internationally?\n\nThe United States is a global leader in conservation and sustainable seafood. Our nation is one of the largest consumers and importers of seafood in the world. U.S. standards for seafood products have a major impact on the sustainability of the world’s global seafood trade.\n\nThe United States has interests as both a seafood-consuming nation and a fishing nation. It is critical that we take an active role in shaping the conservation and management of international fisheries. To achieve this goal, NOAA Fisheries:\n\nSupports U.S. participation in a number of international fisheries agreements\n\nTakes steps to address global illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing\n\nProvides technical assistance to other countries interested in the U.S. fisheries management system\n\nLearn more about international cooperation for sustainable fisheries and seafood\n\nWant to eat more seafood and support the U.S. seafood industry but don’t know where to start? Our sustainable seafood profiles arm you with the facts about what makes U.S. seafood sustainable—from tide to table. Get up-to-date information on the status of federally managed and farmed marine fish and shellfish.\n\nHealth\n\nSeafood is a healthy food choice, providing key nutrients and healthy protein for everyone from infants to adults. Seafood supplies the nutrients essential for strong bones, brain development, and healthy immune and cardiovascular systems. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend adults eat at least 8 ounces of seafood per week. The guidelines also have specific advice for pregnant or nursing mothers and children.\n\nEating Fish: What Pregnant Women and Parents Should Know\n\nUSDA Food Patterns\n\nMercury in Seafood\n\nAdvisories and Technical Resources for Seafood Consumption\n\nBuying and Handling\n\nWhen buying seafood, choose knowledgeable, reputable dealers—those you trust with a known record of proper handling practices. Once you’ve made your seafood purchase and take it home, be sure to “keep it cold, keep it moving, and keep it clean.” Follow our tips below!\n\nLearn more about buying seafood\n\nLearn more about handling and storing seafood\n\nRecipes\n\nLemon butter shrimp, New England style clam chowder, Parmesan crusted swordfish, and more! Looking for a new seafood dish or an old favorite? If you need some cooking inspiration, browse these seafood recipes for main dishes, appetizers, sides, and more!\n\nCheck out seafood recipes\n\nInspection and Safety\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration runs a mandatory fish inspection program for all seafood processors and retailers, both domestic and international. This program monitors seafood at critical points along the supply chain to prevent food safety problems. NOAA Fisheries also manages a voluntary, fee-for-service program that works with other agencies to provide science-based inspection services to the seafood industry to ensure safe, high-quality seafood. Together, we ensure the seafood that enters the U.S. marketplace is safe and wholesome for the consumer.\n\nLearn more about seafood inspection\n\nMislabeling and Fraud\n\nStudies and investigations have found that seafood fraud is committed along the supply chain. Types of fraud range from simple misunderstandings or lack of information to blatant deception to increase profits and attempts to launder illegally harvested seafood. With new and growing partnerships and evolving technologies, we are working across federal agencies and the seafood supply chain to safeguard the sustainability and integrity of seafood in the U.S. marketplace.\n\nLearn more about seafood fraud\n\nSustainable Seafood Across the Globe\n\nThe United States is a significant importer of seafood. Much of that comes from China, Thailand, Canada, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Ecuador. And half of the imported seafood is harvested through aquaculture. NOAA Fisheries is committed to building a level playing field for U.S. fishermen and seafood farmers, advancing sustainable management practices internationally, and strengthening consumer confidence in safe and legal seafood.\n\nUnderstanding illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing\n\nForeign fishery trade data\n\nGlobal aquaculture\n\nU.S. Seafood by the Numbers\n\nEach year we produce three reports on the status of U.S. marine fisheries. The reports take a detailed look at the fisheries and track important indicators such as annual seafood consumption and the productivity of top fishing ports.\n\nStatus of Stocks\n\nFisheries of the United States\n\nFisheries Economics of the United States\n\nThe U.S. seafood industry is incredibly diverse. NOAA Fisheries, working with federal, local, and non-governmental partners, provides support services for fishermen, producers, processors, and other industry professionals.\n\nFisheries Data\n\nWe compile and publish data on fisheries landings, the U.S. fishery processing industry, imports and exports, and other indicators important to seafood industry professionals. Much of the data is collected by NOAA Fisheries scientists, fishery observers, and regional, state, and academic partners. We also work with fishermen and farmers, importers and exporters, processors, distributors, and retailers to ensure we are capturing an accurate picture of our seafood economy.\n\nFisheries landings\n\nFisheries of the United States\n\nPer capita consumption\n\nProcessed products\n\nForeign fishery trade data\n\nFishery Market News\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem Data\n\nWe study a range of indicators to understand the status and trends of ecosystems and the communities that rely on ocean resources. This information helps resource managers analyze the costs and benefits of different activities and understand the impacts of management decisions.\n\nCommercial fisheries economics\n\nSocial indicators for coastal communities\n\nFishing community profiles\n\nProtected species economics research\n\nMarine protected area economics research\n\nMarine ecosystem indicators\n\nInternational Competitiveness\n\nWe are committed to building a level playing field for U.S. fishermen and seafood farmers and expanding opportunities for the U.S. seafood industry. Our work is focused on sustainably expanding domestic production, keeping illegal, unreported, and unregulated products out of U.S. markets, and strengthening global marine stewardship.\n\nExpanding domestic aquaculture\n\nCombating IUU fishing\n\nExporting sustainable fishing and conservation practices\n\nEngaging with international trade organizations\n\nEnforcing international agreements\n\nSeafood Import Monitoring Program\n\nFinancial Support\n\nNOAA Fisheries and our partners administer funds, grants, and other financial services to support seafood professionals. These provide short- and long-term assistance, support for research and innovation, and coverage for certain losses.\n\nFisheries financial services\n\nAquaculture funding opportunities\n\nNOAA Fisheries grant opportunities\n\nSeafood Inspection and Certification\n\nOur Seafood Inspection Program is a voluntary, fee-for-service program that helps the seafood industry improve the quality, safety, and marketability of U.S. seafood and fishery products. This includes export certification services to facilitate the export of U.S. products.\n\nSeafood Inspection Program\n\nSeafood Inspection Laboratory\n\nSeafood Science\n\nOur science-based conservation and management ensures optimum production, enhances our nation’s food security, and supports consumer confidence in U.S. seafood products. Industry professionals play a valuable role in our science through cooperative research programs. NOAA scientists and our partners also work to understand and address issues of importance to the seafood industry, including offshore wind development and climate change.\n\nFisheries surveys\n\nStock assessments\n\nStock status\n\nUnderstanding climate change impacts\n\nAddressing technical and scientific barriers of marine aquaculture\n\nOffshore wind development\n\nA truly sustainable seafood industry also sustains the many communities that rely on that seafood for their livelihoods, cultural practices, and nutrition. Indeed, sustaining the participation of fishing communities in our fisheries is one of the explicit goals of the National Standards governing federal fisheries regulations. NOAA Fisheries’ work directly impacts the economic opportunities, health, and environment of many communities, both domestic and international.\n\nU.S. Seafood Community\n\nUltimately, NOAA Fisheries can only carry out our mission of ensuring safe and sustainable seafood by working with a diversity of people. We support research, conservation initiatives, technological innovation, and community outreach. We fund institutions and organizations made up of those people—the anglers, commercial fishermen, aquaculturists, seafood companies, tribes, scientists, nonprofits, coastal communities, beachgoers, and more. Their expertise and perspectives directly influence how we manage fisheries and aquaculture, and protect marine mammals and endangered species, as we develop and enforce regulations that are fair and equitable.\n\nFaces of Seafood\n\nHave you ever wondered how your seafood gets to your plate? Some may think the only players in the seafood supply chain are the people who catch the fish and the people who sell it. But with more than a million jobs supported by the U.S. seafood industry, the roles are as diverse as the people who fill them. A truly sustainable seafood industry also sustains the many communities that rely on that seafood for their livelihoods, cultural practices, and nutrition.\n\nLearn more about the people who support U.S. seafood\n\nFishing Community Profiles\n\nTo better understand how changes in fishery regulations may impact different groups of people, we have created profiles of regional fishing communities. The profiles portray each community’s past and current engagement in fisheries. They also contain basic information on the social and economic characteristics of these communities. These reports allow us to assess the social and economic impacts of policies and regulations at the community level, an examination required by various federal statutes.\n\nLearn more about fishing community profiles\n\nUsing Social Science to Benefit Communities\n\nWe conduct additional economic and socio-cultural research beyond the fishing community profiles. This ensures we consider the needs of all of the people that depend on the living marine resources that we manage.\n\nEconomic and socio-cultural analyses help fisheries managers evaluate the benefits and costs of different activities, prioritize needs, and encourage policies that maximize societal benefits from ocean and coastal resources. By studying both the social and economic aspects of communities, we strive to manage fisheries and protected species in a way that balances the perspectives of multiple communities and fisheries-related disciplines.\n\nLearn more about NOAA Fisheries’ socioeconomics research\n\nFostering Diversity and Inclusion in Seafood Communities\n\nNOAA Fisheries is committed to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility at all levels of the organization. We are cultivating a diverse workforce to reflect, understand, and respond to the varied communities and stakeholders we serve. We also celebrate the organizations leading the way. Below are just some of the great organizations that are working in this space, including:\n\nAmerican Fisheries Society’s Hutton Junior Fisheries Biology Program\n\nKuaʻāina Ulu ʻAuamo\n\nMinorities in Aquaculture\n\nSeafood and Gender Equality\n\nSouth Central Los Angeles Sustainable Seafood Hub\n\nWomen in Aquaculture\n\nLearn about the NOAA Fisheries Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2022–2025 (PDF, 18 pages)\n\nGlobal Seafood Community\n\nThe United States is a global leader in conservation and sustainable seafood. Our nation is one of the largest consumers and importers of seafood in the world. U.S. standards for seafood products have a major impact on the sustainability of the world’s global seafood trade.\n\nStrengthening Global Marine Stewardship\n\nWe work closely with foreign governments, foreign entities, and international organizations to promote conservation and sustainable fisheries management internationally.\n\nInternational engagement\n\nInternational and regional fisheries management organizations\n\nInternational fisheries agreements\n\nCombating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing\n\nIllegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing describes a wide variety of fishing-related activities that violate both national and international fishing regulations. These activities significantly undermine U.S. and global efforts to sustainably manage fisheries and conserve marine resources. As a result, IUU fishing threatens food security and upsets the economies of coastal communities around the world. NOAA Fisheries is one of several federal agencies working together to effectively address this critical issue.\n\nUnderstanding IUU fishing\n\nIdentification of IUU fishing activities\n\nKeeping IUU fishing products out of U.S. markets\n\nImproving Fisheries Governance\n\nThe lack of information and oversight in fisheries management among some developing nations has resulted in declining marine stocks, many of which are vital to providing fish to the local markets. We encourage various fisheries governance projects and programs to achieve effective and responsible marine stewardship and ensure sustainable global fisheries management.\n\nInternational fisheries governance efforts\n\nConserving International Species and Reducing Bycatch\n\nThe United States is a leader in promoting the global conservation of marine mammals, sharks, tunas, sea turtles, and seabirds. One of the ways we work to conserve these species internationally is by helping foreign countries reduce bycatch. We support bilateral and multilateral cooperative efforts that work on the ground to reduce bycatch, including data collection efforts and projects to improve bycatch reduction technologies.\n\nInternational bycatch reduction projects and resources"
