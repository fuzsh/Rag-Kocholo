        "text": "The Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet) established this network of monitoring stations for the purpose of measuring atmospheric mercury fractions which contribute to dry and total mercury deposition. Sites will collect concentrations of atmospheric mercury species from automated, continuous measuring systems, concentrations of total mercury in precipitation, and meteorological measurements. Data will be collected with standardized methods, with quality assured data archived in an online data base.\n\nAMNet has specific objectives:\n\nMeasure atmospheric mercury concentrations of gaseous oxidized, particulate-bound, and elemental mercury in select locations\n\nOffer high-quality measurement data to estimate dry and total deposition of atmospheric mercury to other researchers\n\nStandardized operational methods so that instruments are being operated consistently\n\nProvide internal and external quality assurance\n\nProvide the data management capability and access\n\nProvide field support through an experienced site liaison\n\nAs with other networks, NADP welcomes the participation of other organizations and scientists. To truly understand the mercury problem, more monitoring information is needed.\n\nInformation on joining the network is available here.\n\nData Notices\n\nData Request Form\n\nNote of Sites Ending: There is an expectation that at the end of the federal year (Sept 30, 2024), two important AMNet sites will likely close: Mauna Loa (HI00) and Utqiagvik (AK95). These closings are due to high costs of keeping the sites operational within NOAA. If you are using these sites for your research, we are expecting this data to end soon. If you have concerns, please contact the Program Office.\n\nMetadata\n\nAMNet Metadata"
