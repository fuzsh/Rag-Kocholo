NASA and the nation benefit from a cadre of future scientists, engineers and other professionals who become familiar and experienced in multinational environments. Internship sessions are arranged in three sessions during the calendar year (spring, summer and fall).\n\nLearn More\n\nEligibility at a Glance\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nAre Internships Paid?\n\nThe majority of interns receive a stipend award, but there are some volunteer opportunities noted in project descriptions.\n\nIs housing my responsibility if I receive an internship?\n\nInterns are responsible for making their own housing arrangements. This includes locating their own housing options and paying for their housing. Centers may be able to offer minimal assistance by providing a list of local available housing and/or establishing a private social media group for interns to utilize for relocation planning purposes.\n\nIs a Letter of Recommendation required?\n\nThe Office of STEM Engagement does not require a letter of recommendation.\n\nWill I need a car?\n\nYour center location and housing options will determine if you need a car. At most centers, unless you find housing within walking distance, you will most likely need a car. However, there are ample public transportation options at some centers\n\nI'm not a science or engineering student. Can I still get an internship at NASA?\n\nYes! Interns may support a variety of business and program management work, including human resources, administration and program analysis, accounting and budget, communication and public relations, procurement and contracts, information technology, security, and education. No matter your academic major, you’ll find that NASA is a place where you’ll belong to a supportive community that values your background, perspective, and life experiences.\n\nMy Path to NASA\n\nAstronauts are often the face of NASA, but our workforce is made up of all kinds of professionals. We are scientists, engineers, IT specialists, human resources specialists, accountants, writers, technicians and many other kinds of people working together.
