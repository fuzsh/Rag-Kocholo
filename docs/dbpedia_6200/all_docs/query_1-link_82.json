        "text": "As most natural gas installations are built to order and have to meet particular requirements, the PSA Online Natural Gas systems are similarly specifically engineered to customer requirements for both measurement and control facilities for the measurement of mercury in natural gas.\n\nMercury in Natural gas is of concern as it is both highly toxic with detrimental effects on the environment, and can cause potentially catastrophic damage to Natural gas and Petrochemical installations.\n\nTo avoid any potential damage, companies install mercury removal systems to ensure the important parts of the plant are protected. Periodic measurements of the outlets of these removal systems need to be made to ensure they are operating efficiently. The inlet concentrations also need to be checked to ensure the expected life of the removal bed is met.\n\nAs these measurements are critical, the frequency of measurement needs to be high therefore the preferred method of obtaining this data is by using online instruments. Similarly at LNG terminals, gas tanker ships want fast turnaround times, so again, online instrumentation offering fast and automatic measurements are preferred.\n\nAs most natural gas installations are build to order and have to meet specific requirements, the PSA Online Natural Gas systems are similarly specifically engineered to customer requirements for both measurement and control facilities for the measurement of mercury in natural gas.\n\nThe Online Natural Gas systems are based on two modules, the PSA 10.54X Sampling System and the PSA 10.670 Process Analyser. These units operating together provide a powerful mercury monitoring system for Natural gas.\n\nThese modules can utilise optional modules such as Primary Pressure Reduction, Primary Bypass Control or use Automatic Carrier Gas Control to configure a bespoke system.\n\nPSA have designed suitable online sampling systems based on the widely used offline sampling system the PSA 10.547D which ensure that the sample taken is fully representative of the matrix when presented to the measurement device.\n\nThe PSA 10.54X series of online sampling systems have been designed to operate in hazardous areas using electrical components certified to explosion proof rating and are built to handle an typically 1-8 channels (although 4 streams are normally the maximum in one cabinet).\n\nThe process analyser section is housed in a purged enclosure which can utilise air or nitrogen purge. The purged enclosure has a controller which only allows power to be applied to the instrument when it is safe to do so and can be constructed to meet NEC, IECEx or ATEX standards.\n\nThe heart of the PSA 10.670 Online Analyser is the PSA 10.525 Sir Galahad mercury analyser operating in dual amalgamation mode. The system also contains a stream selection unit (for multi channel operation and automatic calibration), an automatic calibration system PSA 10.536 Hg Vapour Generation and an industrial computer with monitor running the PSA Online Software.\n\nThe PSA 10.670 used for the measurement of mercury in natural gas by atomic fluorescence follows the ASTM 6350-98 and ISO 6978-2 procedures and is specifically configured for the petrochemical industry.\n\nThe system can be expanded to simultaneously handle the online analysis of mercury in volatile liquid hydrocarbons and condensates by the addition of the PSA 10.690 Mercury Preconcentration system.\n\nP S Analytical have sold large numbers of Sir Galahad systems for the determination of Mercury in Natural Gas to all the oil and gas multinationals, the majority of the field testing companies and many of the mercury removal system suppliers.\n\nMany Online Mercury in Natural gas/LNG Systems have been sold worldwide to customers who have multiple systems, many of which handle multiple gas streams.\n\nTo discuss particular requirements and for more detailed information on the above products, please complete the Information Request Form."
