        "text": "Return larger compressed gas tanks (more than 20 pounds each) to a local supplier.\n\nDrop off small compressed gas tanks and cartridges (up to 20 pounds each) at Household Hazardous Waste (HHW).\n\nAll compressed gas containers, whether empty, full, or partially full, must be recycled at the Household Hazardous Waste drop-off sites at I-66 Transfer Station and I-95 Landfill Complex. Do NOT place them in your recycling bin or at the curb for trash pickup. Do NOT dispose as scrap metal or “white goods”. Compressed gas containers are regulated as hazardous waste by the EPA. HHW staff will ensure that containers meet all applicable requirements for proper disposal.\n\nSome examples of compressed gas containers include aerosol spray cans, cartridges (CO2, NO2, Oxygen, Helium) used in dispensers (e.g., helium, whipped cream, soda), fire extinguishers, helium tanks, inhalers, and small propane tanks like those used on gas grills.\n\nLearn more about Household Hazardous Waste.\n\nHousehold Hazardous Waste accepted at the I-66 Transfer Station and I-95 Landfill Complex.\n\nAfter 24 hours have passed, all leftover hot ash material must be thoroughly dampened, cooled, and stored in a metal can that is used solely for ash storage.

After all procedures have been followed, you can place the container out for regular trash collection.\n\nReduce the number of books you collect in the future by investing in an e-reader and/or checking out books from the library.\n\nReuse books by considering the following options:\n\nChildren’s Books can be used at day care centers, after-school programs, and hospitals.\n\nAlso consider donating to organizations that promote literacy for children and adults – either locally or nationally.

Otherwise, contact your collection company for specific disposal/recycling guidelines.\n\nVHS cassette tapes and magnetic recording tape are accepted at the electronics recycling area of the I-66 Transfer Station and I-95 Landfill Complex.
