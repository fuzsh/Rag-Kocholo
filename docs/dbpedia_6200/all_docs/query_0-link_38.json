        "meta_description": "By releasing its new Application Lifecycle Management 11 platform at its HP Software Universe 2010 conference in Barcelona, Spain, Nov. 30, Hewlett-Packard made a major statement about its plans to continue to move aggressively to address the software needs of enterprise customers in a way it previously has not. The ALM 11 software includes technology that has been two years in the making. HP Software, a business unit within HP's Technology Solutions Group, has dramatically transformed in the past three yearsÂ—from being one of the least profitable to one of the most profitable and fastest-growing business units within HP. Over the past several years, HP Software has invested both organically through R&D and through acquisitions in growing its portfolio to better meet customer needs. In addition, HP, for the first time, became a true software organization with a high-performing enterprise software sales force. The HP Software portfolio addresses several areas of need, including IT management software, application quality management, business service automation, IT service management, business service management, demand and portfolio management, and more. The company has made key hires and acquisitions designed to focus more specifically on the software market. Move over IBM and Oracle. To HP, software now means business.",
