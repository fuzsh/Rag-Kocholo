One of the objectives of this agreement was the vocational training of young electronics and physics laboratory technicians. CERN, an important stakeholder in the local economy, highlighted with this agreement its willingness to participate in the local social and economic development. The first apprentice arrived at CERN in 1965. In 1971, the apprenticeship centre was created; it now hosts over twenty apprentices in total and welcomes about six new apprentices each year. These apprenticeships are for young people aged between 15 and 21 years, coming from one of the CERN Member States, and having completed their mandatory education, e.g. 11th grade in Switzerland or 3Ã¨me in France. The training is divided between working time at CERN and one or two days per week at school (CFPT in Geneva for electronics or ...\n\nCERN honours Georges Charpak\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nCERN pays tribute to the work of Georges Charpak at a colloquium in honour of his 85th birthday. var flash_video_player=get_video_player_path(); insert_player_for_external('Video/Public/Movies/2009/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008-0753-kbps-480x360-25-fps-audio-64-kbps-44-kHz-stereo', 'mms://mediastream.cern.ch/MediaArchive/Video/Public/Movies/2009/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008-Multirate-200-to-753-kbps-480x360.wmv', 'false', 480, 360, 'https://mediastream.cern.ch/MediaArchive/Video/Public/Movies/2009/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008-posterframe-480x360-at-10-percent.jpg', '1167500', true, 'Video/Public/Movies/2009/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008/CERN-MOVIE-2009-008-0600-kbps-maxH-360-25-fps-audio-128-kbps-48-kHz-stereo.mp4'); Watch the video conference of Georges Charpak.

They have a passion for their work, know CERN inside-out and for 40 years have shown people of all ages and nationalities, from all walks of life, around the Laboratory. Who are they? Why, the CERN guides, of course. On 27 January, ten of CERN's 180 guides received special honours for their impressive number of guided tours in 2003. Presenting the awards in the Microcosm hall, CERN's Director-General Robert Aymar congratulated the winners on the key role they play with respect to the general public. \"CERN would be nothing without you who show them its activities,\" he stressed.

The programme was consolidated with the opening of the training centre in 1971. In recent years CERN has taken on seven new technical apprentices each year (four in electronics, three in physics laboratory work), plus one or two administrative apprentices, such that there always are around 30 apprentices in total at CERN. The programme is highly regarded in Geneva by the authorities, industry, schools and young people, and contributes very positively to CERN's local image. Since the beginning 160 young people have now successfully completed their apprenticeships at CERN. Unlike some other employers, as a general rule CERN does not take on its ex-apprentices as staff; on completing their years at CERN the apprentices usually go on to higher education or are sought after by other employers.\n\nHats off to CERN's Master of Apprenticeships!\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2004-01-01\n\nRoland Gay of the HR Department (at right) recently received a special diploma from the Geneva Industrial Union (UIG).

To be designated, an achievement must be at least 25 years old, must have involved a unique solution to an engineering problem, and must have had at least regional impact. Currently there are more thanÂ 50 IEEE Milestones around the world. http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/cern.html The installation and unveiling of this IEEE Milestone will provide the opportunity to emphasize the close relationship between science, technology, industry and well-being in society.Â A ceremony, organised with the support of a group of IEEE members working at CERN, will be held at the CERN Globe of Science and Inn...\n\nA glowing tribute to CERN craftsmanship\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2001-01-01\n\nDidier Lombard, metalworker in EST Division, has been crowned 'France's Top Craftsman'. It's the second time this prestigious title has been bestowed upon a CERN staff member. The reputation of CERN's craftsmanship outside the Laboratory just keeps on growing! For the second time in a row, a member of EST Division's Manufacturing Facilities Group has been named France's Top Craftsman. After Michel Caccioppoli in 1997, Didier Lombard has now taken his place on the roll of honour. This triennial competition seeks to honour workers and skilled craftspeople in two hundred different trades, from pastry-makers and painters to lacemakers and goldsmiths. To win the medal, competitors must produce an object on the basis of a compulsory specification. 3412 competitors entered this 21st edition of the contest, which covered the period 1997 to 2000.

Â In front of Geneva University's crowded auditorium, Albert Hofmann and Steve Myers received title of Doctor Honoris Causa last Friday 8 June. The two members of CERN thereby received the University's highest distinction. This honour comes in recognition of their careers in the service of accelerator physics and their essential contribution to the success of LEP. Steve Myers joined CERN in August 1972 to work as engineer-in charge of the Intersecting Storage Rings collider (ISR). He was responsible for the acceleration by phase displacement of the high intensity beams to 31 GeV/c. He also worked on many other topics, notably the beam-beam effect in the ISR.

As CERN has grown as a laboratory and a community, the Bulletin has been there to cover each development as it happens. In honour of the publication's 50th anniversary, we're taking a trip through CERNâs history via the headings and hidden corners of its internal newsletter. Â Â It's 1965 and CERN - now 11 years old - has matured from a simple lab to a fledgling community. While news could once spread in a single afternoon, CERN's growth necessitated a new approach to the sharing of internal information. Meanwhile, the CERN Courier - the only publication in town - was approaching a more global physics audience â an audience for whom CERN road closures were not breaking news. And so, in March 1965, the Weekly Bulletin was born. What was meant as a simple newsletter of events and internal announcements quickly developed into a wider source of news about CERN....\n\nFifty years of CERN history in the spotlight\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe programme of events for CERN's Golden Jubilee year was officially unveiled at a press conference on 8 March.

On Sunday, April 12, an avalanche buried four out of five skiers, taking part in a ski touring in the region of the Becs de Bosson in Valais (CH). The fifth skier, who had not been buried in the snow,Â courageously managed to save two of the skiers, but HervÃ© Milcent, 49 years, federal ski instructor, and Mattieu Cattin, 33 years, were buried under two to three meters of snow, far down the avalanche slope, and did not survive, despite the fast arrival of the mountain rescue. In its 40 years of existence, the CERN Ski Club, one of the biggest in the Geneva area, has never been confronted with such a tragedy. The passing of HervÃ© and Matthieu has deeply shocked and saddened all volunteers of the Club as well as the entire alpine community.

Arriving at CERN as Visiting Scientist in June 1966, I joined the Anti-Apartheid Movement immediately. We multiplied the initiatives at CERN and outside of CERN until the release of Mandela with citizens of Geneva, but also with \"citizens of the world\", who ignored the ban on political activity, particularly for international civil servants. The Anti-Apartheid Movement of Geneva soon became the Anti-Apartheid Movement of Switzerland. It was also the first Anti-Apartheid Movement outside of South Africa. CERN today is honoured to have brought it to the baptismal font thanks to the initiative of several colleagues, including Mike Pentz, president of the CERN staff Association for two years (1961 ï­ 1963) and also a refugee from South Africa in Europe.

A cause of outrage and disdain in todayâs (Western societies, the notion of restoring honour through a violent act is, in fact, deeply rooted in European legal and cultural history. By examining French, Anglo-Saxon, German and Italian examples, it is revealed that to varying degrees emotions, and, in some cases honour in particular, were accommodated in legislation as granting the perpetrator extenuating circumstances. Adultery in particular was thought to compromise the honour of husbands, thus entrenching an inherently gendered conception of honour. However, leniency of the law was mostly dependent on âºheat of the momentâ¹ arguments, attempts to avenge the violation of oneâs honour, rather than premeditated, cold-blooded revenge killings restoring the collective honour of the family. By discriminating between notions of individual and collective (family honour, examples from European history exhibit a qualitative difference compared to modern day honour killings. The full extent of hypocrisy in judging modern day (Muslim honour killings, however, becomes apparent when considering that gendered concepts of emotions and honour only disappeared from European legal thought after the 1970s, partly following feminist criticism.\n\nThe hundredth Gentner Doctoral Student has started at CERN\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN Bulletin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlmost ten years after the start of the programme in 2007, the hundredth Gentner Doctoral Student started his PhD at CERN.

Here ird, sharaf or izzat and shame are adhered to particular moral codes that are more likely to be found in the Quran. This clichÃ©d version of HBV frames Muslim womenâs sexual autonomy as exceptionally regulated, most commonly by male family members with the complicity of female relatives. In its most extreme (and publicly known form, HBV is epitomised by the âhonourâ killings that come to the attention of the criminal justice system and, as a consequence, the media. Yet emerging research shows that HBV unfolds through increasingly punitive systems of social punishment, which is neither unique to Islam, nor religious communities more generally. In this paper, it is argued that the construction of HBV as a matter of deviant and antiquated Muslim honour codes is Islamophobic and that a more productive lens through which to understand collective familial violence may lie in the conceptual framework of heteronormativity.\n\nMenâs and womenâs honour\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMai, Anne-Marie\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis article has the conceptions of honour in Henrik Ibsenâs A Dollâs House (1879/1889) as its springboard, includes the concept of honour in Thit Jensenâs novels about the modern, emancipated woman Gerd.

It may be that culture impacts tendencies to \"fight\" or \"flee\" from social threat. Honour cultures, including the American South, permit or even promote aggression in response to honour-threats. Thus, social anxiety in the South may be more associated with aggression than in non-honour cultures. In the current sample, region moderated the relation between social anxiety and aggression; social anxiety related positively to reactive (but not proactive) aggression among Southerners (n = 285), but not Midwesterners (n = 258). Participant sex further moderated the relationship, such that it was significant only for Southern women. Also, for Southerners, prototypically masculine honour-concerns mediated the relationship between social anxiety and reactive aggression. Cultural factors may play key roles in aggressive behaviour among some socially anxious individuals.\n\nCERN pays tribute to Herwig and Ingeborg Schopper\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOn 15 September CERN hosted a tribute to commemorate Herwig Schopperâs 85th birthday. The symposium was also dedicated to Schopperâs wife Ingeborg, who passed away on 14 September, and CERNâs Director-General Rolf Heuer led the audience in observing a minute of silence in her honour. Herwig Schopper with his colleagues and friends at the symposium organised for his 85th birthday in the Main Auditorium.Schopperâs role in world science has been enormous in such frontier fields as nuclear and particle physics as well as other areas of advanced scientific research; in the promotion of international scientific co-operation; and in the advancement of peace through scientific endeavour, to give only a few examples. He has served as Director of DESY, Director-General of CERN and President of the SESAME Council.

Gordon Lee (IT) is in the white top, just behind the runner in yellow in the centre of the photo. On a bright and sunny 1 December last, a team from CERN lifted the honours for the company team event of Switzerland's most popular running race. The occasion was the 24th 'Course de l'Escalade'. The Escalade races wind through the narrow streets of Geneva's Old Town, lined with friends and well-wishers for the event. Since they began in 1978, they have become so popular that the Escalade now ranks among the largest popular running events in Europe. Some 19000 people aged from 5 to 85 donned running shoes to brave the crowds last December. Clearly, not all could run at once, so races by category started at 11am and continued until after 7pm. Distances ranged from about 2 km for the youngest children to 7.5 km for the men's categories. 100 or so runners, men and women, from the top international elite were invited for the race.

In 2014 a pregnant woman was killed in front of Lahore High Court, by her family members, in the name of honour. This study was conducted to determine the perspective of university students on honour killing with specific reference to one such killing incident in Lahore. Cumulatively, 989 students participated in the survey. Compared with female students, male students were less likely to agree and were more unequivocal that a woman has a right to marry any man she wants despite her family's disapproval, in a statistically significant manner. Similarly, male students were statistically significantly more likely to report that killing in the name of honour is always justified and were less equivocal about it compared to female students. Nonetheless, cumulatively 824 (83.3%) students believed that killing in the name of honour is not always justified.\n\nFirst âGentner Doktorâ finishes PhD at CERN\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nJordan Juras\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn 2007, the CERN Doctoral Student Programme saw the addition of the Gentner Doctoral Student Programme, named in honour of the celebrated nuclear physicist, Wolfgang Gentner.

To honour one of the greatest physicists of the century, who died last October, and a staunch friend, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste has announced the Paul Adrien Dirac Gold Medal Award, to be given annually for highest achievement in theoretical physics. The International Committee for Future Accelerators, ICFA, held its twelfth meeting at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, on 10 April. The CERN Accelerator School was greatly encouraged by the response to the General Accelerator Physics Course organized last year in collaboration with the Orsay and Saclay Laboratories in France. On 11 March, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste paid tribute to the memory of Alfred Kastler, Nobel Laureate for Physics 1966 and Chairman of the ICTP Scientific Council from 1970 to 1982, who died on 7 January 1984.\n\nCognitive apprenticeship in health sciences education: a qualitative review.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLyons, Kayley; McLaughlin, Jacqueline E; Khanova, Julia; Roth, Mary T\n\n2017-08-01\n\nCognitive apprenticeship theory emphasizes the process of making expert thinking \"visible\" to students and fostering the cognitive and meta-cognitive processes required for expertise. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the use of cognitive apprenticeship theory with the primary aim of understanding how and to what extent the theory has been applied to the design, implementation, and analysis of education in the health sciences. The initial search yielded 149 articles, with 45 excluded because they contained the term \"cognitive apprenticeship\" only in reference list. The remaining 104 articles were categorized using a theory talk coding scheme. An in depth qualitative synthesis and review was conducted for the 26 articles falling into the major theory talk category. Application of cognitive apprenticeship theory tended to focus on the methods dimension (e.g., coaching, mentoring, scaffolding), with some consideration for the content and sociology dimensions. Cognitive apprenticeship was applied in various disciplines (e.g., nursing, medicine, veterinary) and educational settings (e.g., clinical, simulations, online). Health sciences education researchers often used cognitive apprenticeship to inform instructional design and instrument development. Major recommendations from the literature included consideration for contextual influences, providing faculty development, and expanding application of the theory to improve instructional design and student outcomes. This body of research provides critical insight into cognitive apprenticeship theory and extends our understanding of how to develop expert thinking in health sciences students. New research directions should apply the theory into additional aspects of health sciences educational research, such as classroom learning and interprofessional education.\n\nApprenticeship training in Denmark : the impacts of subsidies\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nWestergÃ¥rd-Nielsen, Niels Chr.; Rasmussen, Anders Rue\n\n1997-01-01\n\nFor years, Denmark has maintained and developed its apprenticeship system which is comparable to the German system. Today, about 40% of the youth cohorts get apprenticeship training. The paper describes the basic functioning of the labour market of apprentices. It is initially shown how the wage...... and unemployment rates of skilled workers who have served an apprenticeship differ from those of non-skilled workers. In recent years there have been periods with serious mismatches between the demand for and the supply of apprenticeships. Through the 80's subsidies were introduced to overcome this shortage....... The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the possible impact of these subsidies. A unique longitudinal data set that enables us to follow 1000 work places from 1980 to 1991 is applied. This makes it possible to control for observed and unobserved work place effects.

This is largely due to the serious implications of the crisis, in conjunction with the idea that apprenticeships could be an alternative educational pathway for boosting labour market integration, an idea also promoted by EU institutions. Against this backdrop, the present article is, essentially, the first effort made to highlight, in a succinct and critical way, the crucial dimensions of an under-researched key aspect of the apprenticeships in Greece: company engagement. Drawing on the findings of a large-scale, mostly qualitative, research project (December 2015âMarch 2017 that reviewed apprenticeship programmes in this country, and during which, inter alia, 150 stakeholders were surveyed and an online survey was conducted with 828 employers, the article highlights the strengths characterizing company involvement in apprenticeships, but also severe shortcomings which overshadow the strengths. It is argued that there is an urgent need for restructuring. Otherwise, the potential of apprenticeships in Greece to be an alternative educational pathway to boost employment at a time of extremely high unemployment, especially for young people, will be undermined.\n\nMotorcycle Mechanic: Apprenticeship Course Outline.

In both the case of Dr Maurice Hutzler, who committed suicide after conflicts with senior colleagues at the Gisela Children's Hospital and a sentence of the court of honour of the Munich Medical District Society, and the Berlin \"patient trade\" affair, in which the medical professors Ernst von Leyden, Hermann Senator, Karl Anton Ewald and Carl Posner were accused of having made payments to middlemen for bringing them lucrative private patients, notions of personal and professional honour played a central role. The Munich case highlighted shortcomings of the Bavarian medical court of honour system, which was less developed than its Prussian counterpart. The analysis of the two cases suggests that the ethics of medical practice in early twentieth-century Germany should be viewed as part of a culture of honour.\n\nCMS and ATLAS honour their suppliers\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn order to motivate the hundreds of companies building their detectors, the CMS and ATLAS collaborations have recently been handing out awards of excellence to their top suppliers. At its second ceremony of this kind, CMS honoured four of its suppliers, while ATLAS for the first time paid tribute to two of its contractors. The atmosphere in the Council Chamber was festive rather than formal at the start of CMS week on Monday 5 March. Before embarking upon a long series of seminars and presentations, the Collaboration held its second awards ceremony to honour its top suppliers. By paying tribute to the exceptional efforts of certain suppliers, the Collaboration's aim is to motivate all the firms, some 500 in total, taking part in the experiment's construction. The CMS Awards panel thus singles out contractors who have not only provided full satisfaction in terms of compliance with specifications, quality and deadlines, but have in addition provided original solutions to delicate problems.

Pedagogies of engagement, like service-learning, are touted as one means to achieve these goals. Connections between first-year experience and service-learning programs have been slow to develop. Further, empirical studies on service-learning in university honours education are similarly scarce. This article examines first-semester honours postsecondary students' sense of civic responsibility before and after completing a service-learning program linking a course on the Evolution of Community to direct volunteerism in struggling schools. Based on pre-post-responses (n=119 to the Level III-Civic Responsibility Survey, analysis of variance with repeated measures showed that participants' sense of civic responsibility was significantly increased over time on each of the dependent variables (i.e., community connectedness, civic attitudes, civic efficacy. Community connectedness scores increased significantly at the .005 level, F(1, 118 = 9.703, p = .002.
