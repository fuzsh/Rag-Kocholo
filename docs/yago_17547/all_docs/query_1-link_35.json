        "text": "Personal statement\n\nDr Tariq Masood is passionate about design, operations and innovation policy topics related to smart factories, Industry 4.0 technology adoption, system design, process & change management, manufacturing systems, through-life engineering service systems, smart grids, and global challenges addressing UN Sustainable Development Goals. He has published numerous book chapters, conference papers (e.g. in European Operations Management Association series) and articles in leading journals (e.g. Science Robotics, Robotics & Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, International Journal of Production Research, Computers in Industry, Computers & Industrial Engineering, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, and Production Planning & Control). Dr Masood sits on the editorial advisory boards of several journals, e.g. IET Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing (Wiley), Digital Twin (Taylor & Francis), Cobot (Taylor & Francis) and Energies (MDPI). He is also an academic editor of PeerJ Computer Science journal, and guest editor of special issues on topics related to Industry 4.0 technologies and global challenges in 'energies' and 'sustainability' journals of MDPI. During 2015-16, he founded a research programme on Industrial Systems of the Future, and a global network on Disaster Resilient Operations (DROPS), both at the University of Cambridge. Both initiatives have left legacies. These programmes have also been instrumental in successfully producing several high calibre research students. Dr Masood is also a co-founder and was an Interest Group Champion at Cambridge Global Challenges Strategic Research Initiative. Prior to this, Dr Masood has worked at University of Cambridge, Rolls-Royce, Cranfield University and Loughborough University. He has a PhD in Reconfigurable Manufacturing from Loughborough University. ORCID ID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9933-6940"
