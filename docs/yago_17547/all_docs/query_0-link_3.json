A staunch supporter of nuclear power, Ahmad has led Pakistan's delegation in many international and national forums and conferences in the issues of peaceful use of nuclear energy. A student of Abdus Salam, Ahmad was one of the senior scientists, despite of his age, of Theoretical Physics Group – a physics group that was mandated to develop the designs of nuclear weapons.
