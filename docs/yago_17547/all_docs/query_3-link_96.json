        "text": "Are you an EPFL student looking for a semester project?\n\nWork with us on data science and visualisation projects, and deploy your project as an app on top of GraphSearch.\n\nLearn more about Graph Apps.\n\nFayyazuddin, also spelled as Fayyaz Uddin (فياض الدين born 10 November 1930), is a Pakistani theoretical physicist, emeritus professor, specialising in theoretical physics and mathematical physics at Quaid-e-Azam University campus National Centre for Physics, Islamabad. He is a senior scientist at the National Center for Physics. Fayyaz is doing research in the fields of quantum mechanics, particle physics, and meson physics. He has published numerous physics papers accompanied by Riazuddin and has co-authored Quantum Mechanics by Fayyazuddin and Riazuddin published in 1990. Fayyazuddin is the twin brother of physicist Riazuddin, and a student of Abdus Salam. He and his twin brother Riazuddin were born on 10 November 1930 in Ludhiana where they received their intermediate education. Following the partition of India, the family migrated to Lahore, Pakistan. The two attended Punjab University. Fayyazuddin completed his Bachelor of Arts with honors in mathematics from Punjab University and subsequently earned Master of Science in mathematical physics under the fellowship of Abdus Salam in 1953. His master's degree dissertation Methods of Mathematical Physics was co-written by Riazuddin. In 1953, he became a Master of Philosophy in particle physics with the academic thesis Energy Loss of Mesons in Crystals under the fellowship of Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry from the same university. Fayyaz moved to Karachi and attended the Karachi University where he became a physics lecturer. After teaching mathematics and physics at Karachi University, Fayyaz traveled to the United Kingdom in 1959. He attended Imperial College London where Abdus Salam and Riazuddin were serving as his teachers. He was awarded a PhD in theoretical particle physics under the fellowship of Abdus Salam in 1962. Fayyaz's dissertation was written on the \"Preliminary Analysis of Photoproduction of K Mesons in the Mandelstam Representation\". Fayyaz then returned to Pakistan and served at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC)."
