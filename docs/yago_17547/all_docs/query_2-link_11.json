        "text": "COSAM Graduate Student Research Forum (Formerly 'COSAM Interdisciplinary Colloquium')\n\nCome learn about the research of COSAM graduate students!\n\nIn an effort to share the research conducted by graduate students in COSAM with others in the research community, two then-graduate students, Dr. Frank Sturm (PhD Mathematics, 2014) and Dr. Hector Corzo (PhD Chemistry, 2017), established the COSAM Interdisciplinary Colloquium series in 2013. Effective from Spring 2023, it is renamed as COSAM Graduate Student Research Forum (GSRF). This forum offers graduate students in COSAM the opportunity to share their insights on their field of study and their research with the broad COSAM community. The given talks are brief; each speaker is allocated 15 minutes of time, which encompasses a 12-minute-long presentation followed by a 3-minute-long discussion. In addition to this format, from Fall 2023, we are going to introduce a 3-minute lightning talk format, similar to the 3-minute thesis graduate school competition. There will be a panel of judges and the top presenters will be rewarded with a CASH PRIZE. Student participation is encouraged. Each forum has at least three speakers from the departments in COSAM. Catered food is freely served to all starting at 12 PM and all the presenters are awarded a small gift and a certificate of participation from the Dean of COSAM.\n\nIf you are interested in giving a talk at one of the upcoming colloquia or if you have any questions, please contact a COSAM GSC senator or the GSRF Chair: Prosenjit Ray (pzr0022@auburn.edu) or any of the GSRF committee members: Akila Abesinghe (aja0077@auburn.edu), Bhavesh Ramkorun (bzr0051@auburn.edu), Bradley Andrew (bra0016@auburn.edu), Emily Churchman (emc0047@auburn.edu), Erica Maul (erm0085@auburn.edu), Kevin Pham (kzp0071@auburn.edu), and Sukanya Dasgupta (szd0086@auburn.edu).\n\nSpring 2024 Semester\n\nTuesday, February 27th, 2024 (5-6:30 PM); CASIC Bldg.
