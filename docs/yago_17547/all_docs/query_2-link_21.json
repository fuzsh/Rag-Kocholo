        "text": "An professor who taught for 13 years at SIUC died of a heart attack Monday afternoon at Carbondale Memorial Hospital .\n\nDr. Riazuddin Zobairi, 66, was born on July 1, 1931, in Etah, India. He received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in philosophy and education at Muslim University in Aligarh, India. In 1971, he received his Ph.D. in education at SIUC.\n\nHe has taught in the countries of Pakistan, Algeria and Nigeria\n\nIn 1984, Zobairi became a professor of Religious Studies at SIUC. The Religious Studies program, which was under the College of Liberal Arts, dissolved in July 1993, so Zobairi became an adjunct associate professor in the History Department that fall.\n\nRobert Jensen, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, remembers\n\nZobairi as a devout Muslim active in community affairs. Jensen also said Zobairi was interested in teaching the aspects of the Islamic religious faith.\n\nHe was interested in all world religions, and especially the relationship between Judaism, Christian and Islamic faiths, Jensen said. He gave lectures in churches and other local organizations on the importance of Islam and what Islam means.\n\nZobairi actively served as the faculty adviser in organizations including the Palestinian Student Association and Students for Health. He was most known for his contributions in the Jews, Christian and Muslims Conversation Series in which he gave most of his lectures on the relationships between various religious faiths.\n\nDale Bengtson, a professor of history at SIUC, said that even though Zobairi was a devout Muslim, he always respected others of different faiths.\n\nHe was extremely compassionate, and he respected members of all religious backgrounds, he said. One student said to me, (Zobairi) was the most kindest and gentle person I’ve ever met.’ That sums it up right there.\n\nZobairi also was known for being perceptive and caring of students.\n\nHe was very student-centered, and he was concerned about his students learning, Jensen said. He was a living embodiment of his faith.\n\nZobairi is survived by his wife and two children.\n\nPrayer services and visitations were Tuesday at the Islamic Center in Carbondale."
