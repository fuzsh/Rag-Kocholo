        "text": "For years, Dr. Dávila focused on understanding the molecular consequences that result from a traumatic injury, but the scope of his research has changed since having worked directly with the community as part of the TRACE project. In a retrospective study conducted by PARC on trauma patients admitted to the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center trauma bay between March 2017 and May 2019, it was discovered that 64.5% of these patients presented with an impaired ability to form blood clots because their platelets are not functioning properly.\n\nThis finding has led to a novel and collaborative line of research which focuses on answering the question: Why is the prevalence of platelet dysfunction (PD) so high in our trauma population? To address the etiology of this disorder, Dr. Davila’s lab is focusing on the patients’ living environment (i.e., home) as a principal contributor to the PD and to the increased mortality rates that plague our trauma patient population. They hypothesize that this is a direct consequence of a hyperactivated immune system resulting from the chronic environmental stress that these patients endure daily while living in low-income, high-crime, and violent areas of Philadelphia (where most of our patient population is from). This study seeks to understand the interdependencies of 1) the physical and social environment; 2) the psychological state as a function of increased environmental stress; 3) the hyperactive neural hormone stress response; and 4) the systemic immune hyperinflammation that creates the conditions for PD and poor medical outcomes.\n\nA major goal for this project is to compel local, state, and federal governments to appropriate money and resources in these high-stress communities. We will argue that investment in these communities will not only increase the clinical outcomes of patients, but will also reduce the exorbitant costs of trauma- the burden of which falls largely on taxpayers. Indeed, crime, violence, and poverty are public health issues, but they also directly impact the health of individual people. Platelet dysfunction is a human vulnerability and the fact that is disproportionately affects low-income communities of color attests to the systemic mechanisms that maintain these health disparities. It is our goal to make healthcare and wellness equal for everyone, and revealing these insidious discrepancies is how we are contributing this movement."
