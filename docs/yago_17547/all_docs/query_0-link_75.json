        "text": "Hoodbhoy is a Pakistani nuclear physicist, essayist, defense analyst, prominent environmentalist and social activist and regularly writes on a wide range of social, cultural and environmental issues. He graduated and also received a PhD from MIT and continues to do research in Particle physics .He is the chairman of Mashal, a non-profit organization which publishes Urdu books on feminism, education, environmental issues, philosophy, and modern thought. Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy is a strong supporter of peaceful use of nuclear technology in Pakistan, nuclear non-proliferation, and nuclear disarmament. He has taught Physics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) as a visiting professor, where he also worked on topics in theoretical applications in the topological insulators, various Hall effects and Graphene. Before joining LUMS, he was a professor of nuclear and high-energy physics, and also the head of the Physics Department, at the Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad. Currently, he holds the Zohra and Z. Z. Ahmed endowed chair in the departments of Mathematics and Physics at Forman Christian College.\n\nHoodbhoy did the O and A-Level exams in Karachi, Sindh and attended Karachi Grammar School. After completing his high school in Pakistan he got a partial scholarship at MIT to pursue his undergraduate studies there. Hoodbhoy showed great interest in Electronics and Mathemetics., Hoodbhoy studied for his double major and gained his double Bachelor of Sciences in Mathematics and Electrical engineering, followed by MS in Solid-state physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973,. After graduation he got a job at Quaid e Azam University and left the US for Pakistan. He went on to obtain a DPhil in Nuclear Physics in 1978 from the same institution. During his doctoral studies, Hoodbhoy had worked with numerous Manhattan Projectscientists (who had worked closely in the development of a first implosion device— Fat Man atom bomb in the 1940s) in the field of nuclear physics. Later, he remained a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Washington. After receiving his doctorate in physics, Hoodbhoy, at MIT, met with the renowned scientists Dr. Abdus Salam and Riazuddin where Salam gave his lectures on particle physics. Hoodbhoy then travelled to Trieste where he became a research associate at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). At ICTP, Hoodbhoy began his research in particle physics that was supervised by Professor Salam. In 1999, Hoodbhoy with Ishfaq Ahmad and Riazuddin, played a major and influential role in the establishment of National Centre of Physics (NCP). With its establishment, Hoodbhoy became one of the earliest academic scientists who joined the NCP at its inception.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nAn Executive member of the board of Riazuddin National Center for Physics.\n\nMember of the Board of Sponsors of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.\n\nAwarded UNESCO’s Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in Pakistan.\n\nHis TV serials and film The Bell Tolls for Planet Earthwon honourable mention at the Paris Film Festival.\n\nA member of the Editorial Board of Pakistaniaat: A Journal of Pakistan Studies.\n\nHe is also the recipient of:\n\nBaker Award for Electronics (1968).\n\nStudent-of-the-Year, Pakistan Students Association of America (1972).\n\nRockefeller Mauze Fellowship for graduate studies (1973).\n\nAbdus Salam Award for Mathematics (1984).\n\nAssociate of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (1986–1994).\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz Award, for contributions towards the cause of education in Pakistan (1990).\n\n“Book of the Year Award”, awarded by the National Book Council of Pakistan (1993).\n\nFulbright Award (1997–1998) for research at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nSelma V.

Pakistan’s 1st wheel chair bound model. She has planned to be 1st wheel chair bound tv host in Pakistan. She has 3 year old son. She believes in playing with vibrant colors and flawless portrayal of true emotions. Her work speaks her heart out and is all about people, their expressions, dreams and aspirations. Muniba Mazari was one of the guest speakers at TEDx Islamabad 2014 event where she portrayed her true emotions.\n\nAlthough wheel chair bound, her spirit and artistry knows no bounds. In fact, she takes the agony of spinal cord injury as a challenge and is more determined to express her sentiments through her art work. About this she said “Although it is hard to paint being a paraplegic, it is not easy to paint with a free mind when you are wheelchair bound, yet I know it is the only way through which I can spread the message of strength and courage. So I forget my pain and paint for myself, I paint for people as I believe in spreading the message of ‘Never Give Up’.” She start her life again as a content writer and one day she saw a polio ad and she got inspired from that change her life path to break the stereotype about people with disabilities.\n\nWhile doing her bachelor in fine arts she met a road accident which made her paraplegic. Currently, she is running her brand by the name ‘Muniba’s Canvas’ with the slogan ‘Let Your Walls Wear Colors’. She is a mix media artist and believes in depicting the ethnic jewels of her region in an abstract way. Some of her work is purely abstract which depicts the humans’ expressions, their thoughts and dreams. Her paintings give the message of living life and represent the real personality of the artist.\n\nAyesha Mustafa, a Pakistani fashion entrepreneur based in UK is one of the lucky ladies and aims to promote women who have made a difference in the world through various personal endeavors. She has been honored to be among the BBC #100 Women, the list that comprises high achievers and go-getters from around the world.\n\nThe founder and director of Fashion ComPassion, an online fashion retail site, she speaks about how it all started for her, “The idea behind Fashion ComPassion is to create luxury with purpose and foster conscious consumerism. We are challenging the status quo by helping customers discover fashion that is kind to both people and the planet. Transparency and sustainability in fashion is the future and we want to be the leaders in this movement.” To run a business that is profitable and sustainable but is based on a model where people and the environment are as important as creating a financial profit. This type of business model is not prevalent in fashion but many are taking steps towards it.\n\nShe started Fashion ComPassion in 2011 as a sustainable online fashion retailer. They provide a platform for socially responsible brands empowering women artisans from war-torn and developing countries. They are currently working with 15 brands, from 20+ women co-operatives in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. They help them with such things as design guidance, product diversification and expansion into new markets.They’ve also partnered with the United Nations World Food Program and every time an item is bought on their site, they help feed a schoolgirl in the developing world.\n\nAbout inspiration she said” Fashion and philanthropy have been my two biggest passions andFashion ComPassion is a combination of the two. The business side of fashion had always been of interest for me – especially looking at who makes garments and how. Growing up in Pakistan and the Middle East, where one sees discrepancy in wealth, poverty and lack of opportunities – especially for girls and women – I wanted to create a platform that could directly help the most marginalized. But it all became clear, when I interned at the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh at age 16 and saw the transformation impact it created on the women, their families and society.”\n\nSharmeen Obaid Chinoy, has been lauded as Pakistan’s first Oscar winner by the press and government. The Pakistani President conferred the Hilal-e-Imtiaz on Obaid-Chinoy on 23 March 2012, for bringing honor to Pakistan as a filmmaker. Saving Face the film exposes the horrifying brutal acid attacks on women, and the amazing work of the British Pakistani plastic surgeon Mohammed Jawad, who travelled back to his countryof birth to rebuild the victims’ disfigured faces. Obaid-Chinoy dedicated the Oscar to “all the heroes working on the ground in Pakistan” and to “all the women in Pakistan who are working for change”.\n\nShe is a Pakistani journalist and documentary filmmaker. She won an Academy Award for her documentary, Saving Face in 2012. She won an Emmy for her documentary, Pakistan: Children of the Taliban in 2010. She is also the first non-American to win the Livingston Award for Young Journalists. Time magazine has named Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy within their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world for 2012. Sharmeen was ranked 37th on Desiclub.com’s list of the 50 Coolest Desis of 2009. Obaid-Chinoy was born in Karachi, to Muslim, Urdu speaking parents, Sheikh Obaid, the CEO of Toweller’s Factory and Saba Obaid. Sharmeen began writing investigative pieces at the age of fourteen as a way to contribute to critical conversation in Pakistan. She was always interested in telling stories of marginalized communities; people whose voices were never heard and whose compelling stories needed to be shared. She started her film company, SOC Films, in Karachi in November 2011. Obaid-Chinoy is also the president of The Citizens Archive of Pakistan, a non profit organization dedicated to Cultural and Historic Preservation. (CAP).\n\nIn December 2001, Obaid-Chinoy returned to Pakistan and spent time in refugee camps and went back to the US with a documentary proposal in hand. At the age of twenty two, with no prior experience, she sent letters to eighty news companies and organizations in the US, and was declined by all of them. Eventually, Bill Abrams, the president of New York Times Television gave her her big break. She returned to Pakistan to produce Terror’s Children. Sharmeen’s work centers around human rights and women’s issues and she has worked with refugees and marginalized communities from Saudi Arabia to Syria and from Timor Leste to the Philippines.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n2007\n\nBroadcast Journalist of the Year Award by One World Media\n\n2010\n\nWon Best Documentary – Pakistan: Children of the Taliban, Emmy Award\n\nWon Young Journalists – Best International Reporting, Livingston Award\n\n2012\n\nWon Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) – Saving Face (2012 film)\n\nWon Best Documentary – Saving Face (2012 film) by New York Indian Film Festival\n\nWon Best Documentary Prize – Saving Face (2012 film) by SAARC films award\n\nAwarded Tamgha-e-Imtiaz (Medal of Distinction) by Govt of Pakistan\n\nWon Lux Style Achievement Award by Lux Style Awards\n\n2013\n\nOutstanding efforts in Promoting Human Rights and Women’s Issues through Film, Crystal Award\n\nWon Best Documentary – Saving Face (2012 film), Emmy Award\n\nWon Outstanding Editing: Documentary and Long Form – Saving Face (2012 film), Emmy Award\n\nNominated Outstanding Science and Technology Programming-Saving Face (2012 film),Emmy Award\n\nNominated Outstanding Cinematography Documentary and Long Form-Saving Face (2012 film), Emmy Award\n\nNominated Outstanding Research – Saving Face (2012 film), Emmy Award\n\nA project by FAST_NU Lahore campus ex faculty member,Mr Zia Imran. Jul Bujh is a snap on retrofit device that improves the efficiency of millions of legacy water heaters across the globe, making them eco-friendly. There is a app available on android and App store of Apple which can specify the schedule and keeps the water at right temperature where you need it and turns off the water heater at other times.\n\nStory behind Jal Bhuj\n\nIn the winter of 2012, Zia Imran and his friend Farrukh Kamran, struck up a conversation on how the natural gas bills were going through the roof during winter months and what could be done to reduce them. They figured that a large portion of a utility bill is because of inefficient household appliances especially the water heater. This is because the legacy thermostat’s design is static and time independent: once you set the thermostat at a particular level, the water heater only maintains the water at that specific temperature, regardless of whether you are using hot water or not. Throughout a cold night, when no one is using water, the water heater continuously burns gas to heat water. This wastes the individual’s money, wastes the world’s energy resources and pollutes our atmospheres. Zia and Farrukh figured there must be an elegant way to make this thermostat intelligent and the water heater economical and eco-friendly. This is what they cooked up on a napkin by the end of the conversation.\n\nOne cold morning, Zia noticed this public information AD in the newspaper.\n\nThis advertisement by the gas distribution company asks people to turn their thermostats to hot before they need warm water and then turn it off when they are done. How many people will get up at 5 in the morning to turn on the heater for when they need a shower at 5:30? Not many. And this is ignoring the discomfort of going outside in sub zero weather.\n\nThis impractical suggestion motivated us more to do something about the energy problem. So journey begins and product they made had following specification.\n\nBy winter of 2013, we had designed various product prototypes. We settled on a design close to our final production design shown below.\n\nWe built 25 units laboriously by hand. 20 of these were deployed in the field and the response was awesome. In two days, our Facebook post resulted in a few hundred requests to get the device. Our users have been very happy and based on some of the feedback received, we have modified the hardware and software design, some details of which are provided below.\n\nHardware\n\nOur hardware design is so efficient and uses so little energy that Jul Bujh can operate one full winter season without battery replacement. In fact the two AA cells that power the processor circuitry can last up to a year and a half, whilst the other two AA cells powering the motor will last full winter season. The hardware configuration has 3 main components: a motor, two optical sensors and a microcontroller. The motor rotates a shaft which is coupled with the “key” on the thermostat. The time for which the motor rotates is determined by feedback from the optical sensors and the microcontroller. The chip used is Texas Instruments’ CC2540. This chip can then communicate with your Bluetooth Smart mobile phone through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Thus, the user tells the chip what to do through an App and, using feedback from optical sensors, the chips turns the motor on and off, hence rotating the thermostat key at the right time. Here is the assembly diagram, cross-section and circuit for Jul Bujh.\n\nSoftware\n\nWe have already built an Android App that connects with Jul Bujh wirelessly through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to program it and fetch battery status and diagnostic information. An iPhone app is in the works. The embedded software in the TI Chip has the capability to detect malfunctions of the motor drive. If the motor gets stuck for some reason the status is recorded and reported back to the user’s phone when it comes in range (BLE has a line of sight range of 80 feet). The embedded software also keeps an eye on battery levels and reports low battery status to the phone so user can replace batteries.\n\nBenefits\n\nIf you take the case of Pakistan, a typical developing country, an average monthly gas bill is $70 for one geyser turned on to max for the full month. Using Jul Bujh, a person can typically achieve $20 in savings at the minimum. If you total that over at least 5 million households* across the nation, you obtain savings of at least $100 million every month.\n\nAnd that is just the monetary returns. There are the obvious environment benefits: fewer fossil fuels burnt means less carbon dioxide, fewer ozone damaging gases and decreased particulates in the air. Furthermore, decreased consumption of natural gas means the nation’s energy reserves sustain for a longer time. Cost of 1 unit of gas will stabilize as danger of overconsumption passes. This means that the underprivileged will not be priced out of natural gas.\n\nRisks & Challenges\n\nLet’s face it, hardware is difficult to do. Especially hardware which involves multiple technologies like Jul Bujh does. Jul Bujh needs three distinct set of expertise, software, hardware design and mechanical and industrial design. They have tried reducing the risk for Indiegogo community by not only developing a prototype but producing and installing 20 units last winter in the field to learn from our customers.\n\nBased on this feedback they have altered the design a bit, added more software features and moved the process form a handmade approach to a mass production process. This conversion to larger scale production and debugging the final design is going on right now. They are very confident that given the experience of the team and their ability to build 20 units and install them successfully in the field will enable them to automate production of larger batches of units by first week of November so they are ready for production runs by end of November. Price of a single Jal Bhuj is $60 and $10 is onsite installation charges. For worldwide shipment cost is $15 more. There are different packages for more than one Jal Bhul so you can contact them on facebook page for any further detail or orders.\n\nWhy Invest?\n\nTheir estimate is that there are 7 million water heaters( geysers) in Pakistan and they wish to target 7 million domestic natural gas connections from their target market. So market is huge and profits are also huge.\n\nJal Bhuj Team\n\nJal Bhuj Team\n\nZia Imran\n\nRarrukh Kamran\n\nJamal Hameed\n\nOsman Malik\n\nFor Contact\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/geyserControl\n\nShe is the second Pakistani to receive a Nobel Prize and the only Pakistani winner of the Nobel Peace Prize; Abdus Salam was a 1979 Physics laureate. Born 12 July 1997, is activist for female education and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize recipient. She is known mainly for human rights advocacy for education and for women in her native Swat Valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Yousafzai’s advocacy has since grown into an international movement. She first came to public attention through that heartfelt diary, published on BBC Urdu, which chronicled her desire to remain in education and for girls to have the chance to be educated. She wrote under a pseudonym – Gul Makai, the name of a heroine from a Pashtun folk tale. When she was shot in the head, wounding two of her school friends as well in October 2012 by a Taliban gunman. she was already well known in Pakistan, but that one shocking act catapulted her to international fame. Police named 23-year-old Atta Ullah Khan, a graduate student in chemistry, as the gunman in the attack.\n\nThe story of her recovery – from delicate surgery at a Pakistani military hospital to further operations and rehabilitation in the UK, and afterwards as she took her campaign global – has been closely tracked by the world’s media. She was discharged from hospital in January 2013 and her life now is unimaginably different to anything she may have envisaged when she was an anonymous voice chronicling the fears of schoolgirls under the shadow of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle wrote in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become “the most famous teenager in the world.”\n\nOn 12 July 2013, Yousafzai’s 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call for worldwide access to education. The UN dubbed the event “Malala Day”.

Dawn columnist Huma Yusuf summarized three main complaints of Yousafzai’s critics: “Her fame highlights Pakistan’s most negative aspect (rampant militancy); her education campaign echoes Western agendas; and the West’s admiration of her is hypocritical because it overlooks the plight of other innocent victims, like the casualties of U.S. drone strikes.” Journalist Assed Baig described her as being used to justify Western imperialism as “the perfect candidate for the white man to relieve his burden and save the native”.Yousafzai was also accused on social media of being a CIA spy. Yousafzai’s memoir I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban, co-written with British journalist Christina Lamb, was published in October 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the U.S. and by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the U.K. The All Pakistan Private Schools Federation announced that the book would be banned in its 152,000 member institutions, stating that it disrespected Islam and could have a “negative” influence.Pakistani investigative editor Ansar Abbasi described her work as “providing her critics something ‘concrete’ to prove her as an ‘agent’ of the West against Islam and Pakistan”. When people compare drones and how UN, USA and UK are favoring Malala they think it as a part of BIG GAME against Islam and Pakistan. People also think that I Am Malala has material against Islam and Pakistan and was actually written by Christina Lamb.\n\nStereotypes breaker Burka Avenger, produced by Unicorn Black is a multi-award winning 3D animated TV series and the first ever animated superhero series made in Pakistan. created and directed by famous Pakistani star and social activist, Aaron Haroon Rashid (AKAHAROON). The main character or Heroine of the show is Jiya, an inspirational school teacher whose alter ego is the super-heroine Burka Avenger. The Burka Avenger fights for Justice, Peace and Education for all specially girls. This Cartoon series in Pakistan is turning stereotypes on their heads. Jiya doesn’t wear a burqa in the daytime but puts one on to transform into the “Burka Avenger”. She is an adopted child by a kabaddi master, who is actually a master of martial art called Takht Kabaddi. Takht Kabaddi is the art of fighting with books and pens. Her weapons , books and pens actually give message of the importance of education and here the pen is more powerful than sword. She fights together with children ‘Ashu’, ‘Immu’ and ‘Mooli’ his pet goat Golu, the Burka Avenger fights the evil magician ‘Baba Bandook’, his henchmen and corrupt politician ‘Vadero Pajero.\n\nSome people criticized her, wearing burqa and Haroon replied “By wearing a burqa she is showing she is a muslim woman and superhero. And that she stands for all the good things of Islam and the real Islamic values — which are equality, woman’s rights, education and peace — rather than the way Islam has been hijacked by radical elements” in an interview. The famous dialog is “The girls of today are the mothers of tomorrow. If the mothers are not educated, then future generations will also remain illiterate.”\n\nImportant thing is that to attract the kids and make them learn ethics, social values and importance of education it’s being presented in a very entertaining manner, full of adventure, comedy and fun, At the end of each show the Burka Avenger comes up and says “Ok kids, the moral of this story or this episode was such and such”. Burka Avenger feature music from artists such as Ali Zafar, Ali Azmat, and JoSH, as well as Haroon. Rapper Adil Omar and Haroon released a music video featuring the Burka Avenger called “Don’t Mess With the Lady in Black”.\n\nThe Burka Avenger achieved many distinctions\n\nWinner of the Peabody Award in 2013\n\nWinner of the International Gender Equity Prize at Prix Jeunesse International Festival\n\nRising Star Award (Category:Animation) at Canada International Film Festival\n\nNamed by Time Magazine as one of the most Influential Fictional Characters of 2013.\n\nFinalist at Prix Jeunesse International Festival (Category: 7-11 Fiction)\n\nFinalist at the 2014 Annecy International Animation Film Festival(Category: TV series)\n\nThe Burka Avenger is giving totally a new concept to the world and breaking a lot of stereotypes about the muslim women and Islam. In the current situation of Pakistan when people need heroes Burka Avenger is performing a very useful source to train and grow new generation with strong ethical, social and educational bases. Washington Post stated “Pakistan’s new superhero makes the hoop-skirted, Prince Charming-obsessed Disney princesses look downright antiquated. She was not born into royalty. She does not obsess about her beauty. And she definitely does not want or need to be whisked off on some white horse or magic carpet. No, Jiya, or the Burka Avenger, is too busy defending women’s rights and education for all. Now that’s what I call a role model for girls.”\n\nEach episode is presenting solution and messages on social issues. On the current issue of polio Haroon said “We always have a social issue or a social message that is the centerpiece of each show. And of course, with the rising number of polio cases- the WHO has declared a medical emergency; there have been 200 cases now. Its alarming, the situation is alarming. So in this particular case we decided to tackle the polio issue head on,” in an interview. He wanted to spread the message of importance of polio vaccination across the Pakistan specially."
