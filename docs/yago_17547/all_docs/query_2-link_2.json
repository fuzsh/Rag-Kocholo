        "text": "I am excited to share that I have achieved the Course Re-Design Badge from Auburn University, Alabama. This badge certifies my professional development skills in learner-centered, backward design using Dee Fink’s Strategies for Significant Learning framework specifically for teaching. I earned this badge after participating in an intensive workshop facilitated by the Biggio Center during the summer of 2024. Throughout the CRD workshop, I gained in-depth knowledge of applying backward design strategies to create a learner-centered course using evidence-based strategies for the upcoming academic year. I am truly grateful to the Auburn University Biggio Center team, especially Lindsay Doukopoulos for their support in making this learning experience dynamic and effective in enhancing my academic journey at Auburn University.\n\nI am happy to share a good news with everyone.I have been awarded a research grant from the Geological Society of America (GSA) for my PhD project. I will have the highest amount of funding which I requested for this year. My succes of securing such funding continues under the mentorship and support of my advisor, Dr. Ashraf Uddin. I am also grateful to the Geological Society of America Student Support Committee for providing me the opportunity. Thank you everyone who supports me unconditionally !"
