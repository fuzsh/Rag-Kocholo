        "text": "I think I will add to what he beautifully explained- A smart person is smart because he believes in himself and thinks everything can be handled: - Without Manipulation - With Acceptance - With Solutions approach - With Trusting the process of life - With a leap of faith on oneself And that is the reason he never leaves to be kind!! So in short all kind people know that they dont have to dispense with their kindness in any situation and believe that they have ability to handle everything without compromising their good kind self and Hence they are ‚ÄúSmart People‚Äù of every world indeed!!! So show your smartness in holding kindness always and dont trade it off for anything üòä #executivecoaching #findingpurpose #corporatecoach #transformationalcoaching\n\nThis is an interesting speech about people who should have evolved and know better but they did not. Some key points: - kindness and empathy are not weakness; - cruelty shows a lack of evolution from our primary animal instinct; - some of these people who consider themselves so smart even became presidents. Listen to the Dean an share your thoughts. #empathy #leadership #evolution #maturity #intelligence"
