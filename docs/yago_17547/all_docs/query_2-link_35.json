        "text": "At least three people were killed and several others were injured in a fire that broke out at Mohammadiya Plaza in Chattogram's Riazuddin Bazar today.\n\nThe deceased were identified as Mohammad Riduan, 45, and Mohammad Shahed, 18, both from Satkania upazila in Chattogram. The identity of the other is yet to be ascertained.\n\nThey are the staff of the shops in the market and lived on the fourth floor of the plaza where the fire broke out.\n\nChattogram Medical College Hospital police outpost in-charge Nur-e-Alam Ashik told The Business Standard that five people from the Riazuddin Bazar fire spot were brought to the hospital in critical condition.\n\nDoctors on duty declared three of them dead while two women were admitted to the hospital.\n\nThe fire erupted around 1:30am on Friday and quickly engulfed the eight-storey building, which houses mobile accessory shops on the first four floors, and various offices, warehouses, and messes on the upper four floors.\n\nDespite the efforts of eight fire service units from Agrabad, Chandanpura, Lamarbazar, and Nandankanan stations, the blaze was only brought under control after nearly four hours, around 5:30am today.\n\nMD Abdul Maledk, assistant director of Fire Service and Civil Defence, told The Business Standard that the fire service responded to the emergency call at 1:40am.\n\n\"However, the narrow lanes prevented fire trucks from accessing the market, complicating firefighting efforts. Firefighters resorted to spraying water from the main road outside the market,\" he added.\n\nThe incident highlights ongoing concerns about the safety and construction standards in Riazuddin Bazar, the city's largest commercial hub. Many buildings in the area are poorly constructed and do not comply with building codes, lacking essential fire safety and parking facilities. Despite multiple warnings from the fire service, business owners have not addressed these critical issues.\n\nAs investigations into the cause of the fire continue, authorities urge market owners and operators to prioritise building safety and adhere to fire regulations to prevent future tragedies."
