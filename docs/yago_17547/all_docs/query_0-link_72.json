        "text": "Association of a nonsense mutation (W1282X), the most common mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish cystic fibrosis patients in Israel, with presentation of severe disease\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShoshani, T.; Bashan, N.; Seret, H.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nOnly about 30% of the cystic fibrosis chromosomes in the Israeli cystic fibrosis patient populations carry the major CF mutation ({Delta}F508). Since different Jewish ethnic groups tended to live as closed isolates until recent times, high frequencies of specific mutations are expected among the remainder cystic fibrosis chromosomes of these ethnic groups. Genetic factors appear to influence the severity of the disease. It is therefore expected that different mutations will be associated with either severe or mild phenotype. Direct genomic sequencing of exons included in the two nucleotide-binding folds of the putative CFTR protein was performed on 119 Israeli cysticmoreÂ Â» fibrosis patients from 97 families. One sequence alteration which is expected to create a termination at residue 1282 (W1282X) was found in 63 chromosomes. Of 95 chromosomes, 57(60%) are of Ashkenazi origin. In conclusion, the W1282X mutation is the most common cystic fibrosis mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish patient population in Israel. This nonsense mutation is associated with presentation of severe disease.Â«Â less\n\nRobust Stimulation of W1282X-CFTR Channel Activity by a Combination of Allosteric Modulators\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Wei; Hong, Jeong S.; Rab, Andras; Sorscher, Eric J.; Kirk, Kevin L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nW1282X is a common nonsense mutation among cystic fibrosis patients that results in the production of a truncated Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) channel. Here we show that the channel activity of the W1282X-CFTR polypeptide is exceptionally low in excised membrane patches at normally saturating doses of ATP and PKA (single channel open probability (PO) < 0.01). However, W1282X-CFTR channels were stimulated by two CFTR modulators, the FDA-approved VX-770 and the dietary compound curcumin. Each of these compounds is an allosteric modulator of CFTR gating that promotes channel activity in the absence of the native ligand, ATP. Although W1282X-CFTR channels were stimulated by VX-770 in the absence of ATP their activities remained dependent on PKA phosphorylation. Thus, activated W1282X-CFTR channels should remain under physiologic control by cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways in vivo. VX-770 and curcumin exerted additive effects on W1282X-CFTR channel gating (opening/closing) in excised patches such that the Po of the truncated channel approached unity (> 0.9) when treated with both modulators. VX-770 and curcumin also additively stimulated W1282X-CFTR mediated currents in polarized FRT epithelial monolayers. In this setting, however, the stimulated W1282X-CFTR currents were smaller than those mediated by wild type CFTR (3â5%) due presumably to lower expression levels or cell surface targeting of the truncated protein. Combining allosteric modulators of different mechanistic classes is worth considering as a treatment option for W1282X CF patients perhaps when coupled with maneuvers to increase expression of the truncated protein.

Here, we investigated the utility of a small molecule corrector/potentiator strategy, as used for ÎF508-CFTR, to produce functional rescue of the truncated translation product of the W1282X mutation, CFTR1281, without the need for read-through. In transfected cell systems, certain potentiators and correctors, including VX-809 and VX-770, increased CFTR1281 activity. To identify novel correctors and potentiators with potentially greater efficacy on CFTR1281, functional screens were done of â¼30,000 synthetic small molecules and drugs/nutraceuticals in CFTR1281-transfected cells. Corrector scaffolds of 1-arylpyrazole-4-arylsulfonyl-piperazine and spiro-piperidine-quinazolinone classes were identified with up to â¼5-fold greater efficacy than VX-809, some of which were selective for CFTR1281, whereas others also corrected ÎF508-CFTR. Several novel potentiator scaffolds were identified with efficacy comparable with VX-770; remarkably, a phenylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine acted synergistically with VX-770 to increase CFTR1281 function â¼8-fold over that of VX-770 alone, normalizing CFTR1281 channel activity to that of wild type CFTR. Corrector and potentiator combinations were tested in primary cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells generated from nasal brushings from one W1282X homozygous subject. Although robust chloride conductance was seen with correctors and potentiators in homozygous ÎF508 cells, increased chloride conductance was not found in W1282X cells despite the presence of adequate transcript levels. Notwithstanding the negative data in W1282X cells from one human subject, we speculate that corrector and potentiator combinations may have therapeutic efficacy in cystic fibrosis caused by the W1282X mutation, although additional studies are needed on human cells from W1282X subjects.

MPS I-H is the most severe form of Î±-L-iduronidase deficiency. Î±-L-iduronidase (encoded by the IDUA gene) is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in the degradation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Using gene replacement methodology, a nucleotide change was introduced into the mouse Idua locus that resulted in a nonsense mutation at codon W392. The Idua-W392X mutation is analogous to the human IDUA-W402X mutation commonly found in MPS I-H patients. We found that the phenotype in homozygous Idua-W392X mice closely correlated with the human MPS I-H disease. Homozygous W392X mice showed no detectable Î±-L-iduronidase activity. We observed a defect in GAG degradation as evidenced by an increase in sulfated GAGs excreted in the urine and stored in multiple tissues. Histology and electron microscopy also revealed evidence of GAG storage in all tissues examined. Additional assessment revealed bone abnormalities and altered metabolism within the Idua-W392X mouse. This new mouse will provide an important tool to investigate therapeutic approaches for MPS I-H that cannot be addressed using current MPS I-H animal models.

There are no currently available animal models which contain a nonsense mutation in the endogenous Cftr locus that can be utilized to test nonsense mutation therapies. In this study, we create a CF mouse model carrying the G542X nonsense mutation in Cftr using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. The G542X mouse model has reduced Cftr mRNA levels, demonstrates absence of CFTR function, and displays characteristic manifestations of CF mice such as reduced growth and intestinal obstruction. Importantly, CFTR restoration is observed in G542X intestinal organoids treated with G418, an aminoglycoside with translational readthrough capabilities. The G542X mouse model provides an invaluable resource for the identification of potential therapies of CF nonsense mutations as well as the assessment of in vivo effectiveness of these potential therapies targeting nonsense mutations.\n\nTranslational read-through of a nonsense mutation causing Bartter syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nCho, Hee Yeon; Lee, Beom Hee; Cheong, Hae Il\n\n2013-06-01\n\nBartter syndrome (BS) is classified into 5 genotypes according to underlying mutant genes and BS III is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding for basolateral ClC-Kb. BS III is the most common genotype in Korean patients with BS and W610X is the most common CLCNKB mutation in Korean BS III. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the CLCNKB W610X mutation can be rescued in vitro using aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are known to induce translational read-through of a nonsense mutation. The CLCNKB cDNA was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector and the W610X nonsense mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Cultured polarized MDCK cells were transfected with the vectors, and the read-through was induced using an aminoglycoside derivative, G418. Cellular expression of the target protein was monitored via immunohistochemistry. While cells transfected with the mutant CLCNKB failed to express ClC-Kb, G418 treatment of the cells induced the full-length protein expression, which was localized to the basolateral plasma membranes. It is demonstrated that the W610X mutation in CLCNKB can be a good candidate for trial of translational read-through induction as a therapeutic modality.\n\nReadthrough of SCN5A Nonsense Mutations p.R1623X and p.S1812X Questions Gene-therapy in Brugada Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeng, Siyong; Huang, Jian; Gao, Zhan; Hao, Jie; Yang, Yuejin; Zhang, Shu; Pu, Jielin; Hui, Rutai; Wu, Yongjian; Fan, Zheng\n\n2017-01-01\n\nNonsense mutation readthrough is used as a gene-specific treatment in some genetic diseases. The response to readthrough treatment is determined by the readthrough efficiency of various nonsense mutations. In this manuscript, we aimed to explore the harmful effects of nonsense mutation suppression. HEK293 cells were transfected with two SCN5A (encode cardiac Na+ channel) nonsense mutations, p.R1623X and p.S1812X. We applied two readthrough-enhancing methods (either aminoglycosides or a siRNA-targeting eukaryotic release factor eRF3a (a GTPase that binds eRF1)) to suppress these SCN5A nonsense mutations. When either of readthrough methods was used, the sodium channel proteins were examined by western blot and immunoblotting and recorded by whole cell patch-clamp to observe the functional characterization of the restored channels. Upon readthrough treatment, the sodium currents were restored to the mutant cDNAs. These mutations reduced full-length sodium channel protein levels, and the sodium currents were reduced to 3% of wild-type. The mutant cDNA sodium currents were increased to 30% of wild-type, and the fulllength proteins also increased. However, the functional characterization of these channels from cDNAs carrying p.R1623X and p.S1812X exhibited abnormal biophysical properties, including a negative shift in steady-state sodium channel inactivation, a positive shift in sodium channel activation and robust late sodium currents. The ramp test showed prolonged QT intervals. These results demonstrated that readthrough-enhancing methods effectively suppressed nonsense mutations in SCN5A and restored the expression of full-length channels. However, the restored channels may increase the risk of arrhythmia.

Readthrough of p.Ser112X (life-threatening) and p.Cys132X (moderate) stop codons was investigated. Readthrough-mediated insertion of wild-type or tolerated residues produce functional proteins. Functional readthrough over homozygous F7 nonsense mutations contributes to the bleeding phenotype. Background Whereas the rare homozygous nonsense mutations causing factor (F)VII deficiency may predict null conditions that are almost completely incompatible with life, they are associated with appreciable differences in hemorrhagic symptoms. The misrecognition of premature stop codons (readthrough) may account for variable levels of functional full-length proteins. Objectives To experimentally evaluate the basal and drug-induced levels of FVII resulting from the homozygous p.Cys132X and p.Ser112X nonsense mutations that are associated with moderate (132X) or life-threatening (112X) symptoms, and that are predicted to undergo readthrough with (132X) or without (112X) production of wild-type FVII. Methods We transiently expressed recombinant FVII (rFVII) nonsense and missense variants in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and evaluated secreted FVII protein and functional levels by ELISA, activated FX generation, and coagulation assays. Results The levels of functional FVII produced by p.Cys132X and p.Ser112X mutants (rFVII-132X, 1.1% Â± 0.2% of wild-type rFVII; rFVII-112X, 0.5% Â± 0.1% of wild-type rFVII) were compatible with the occurrence of spontaneous readthrough, which was magnified by the addition of G418 - up to 12% of the wild-type value for the rFVII-132X nonsense variant. The predicted missense variants arising from readthrough abolished (rFVII-132Trp/Arg) or reduced (rFVII-112Trp/Cys/Arg, 22-45% of wild-type levels) secretion and function. These data suggest that the appreciable rescue of p.Cys132X function was driven by reinsertion of the wild\n\nNonaminoglycoside compounds induce readthrough of nonsense mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDamoiseaux, Robert; Nahas, Shareef; Gao, Kun; Hu, Hailiang; Pollard, Julianne M.; Goldstine, Jimena; Jung, Michael E.; Henning, Susanne M.; Bertoni, Carmen\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLarge numbers of genetic disorders are caused by nonsense mutations for which compound-induced readthrough of premature termination codons (PTCs) might be exploited as a potential treatment strategy. We have successfully developed a sensitive and quantitative high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, protein transcription/translation (PTT)âenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for identifying novel PTC-readthrough compounds using ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) as a genetic disease model. This HTS PTT-ELISA assay is based on a coupled PTT that uses plasmid templates containing prototypic A-T mutated (ATM) mutations for HTS. The assay is luciferase independent. We screened â¼34,000 compounds and identified 12 low-molecular-mass nonaminoglycosides with potential PTC-readthrough activity. From these, two leading compounds consistently induced functional ATM protein in ATM-deficient cells containing disease-causing nonsense mutations, as demonstrated by direct measurement of ATM protein, restored ATM kinase activity, and colony survival assays for cellular radiosensitivity. The two compounds also demonstrated readthrough activity in mdx mouse myotube cells carrying a nonsense mutation and induced significant amounts of dystrophin protein.

Mutations in the WRN gene can be of several types, including nonsense mutations, leading to a truncated protein form. WRN is a RecQ family member with both helicase and exonuclease activities, and it participates in several cell metabolic pathways, including DNA replication, DNA repair, and telomere maintenance. Here, we reported a novel homozygous WS mutation (c.3767 C > G) in 2 Argentinian brothers, which resulted in a stop codon and a truncated protein (p.S1256X). We also observed increased WRN promoter methylation in the cells of patients and decreased messenger WRN RNA (WRN mRNA) expression. Finally, we showed that the read-through of nonsense mutation pharmacologic treatment with both aminoglycosides (AGs) and ataluren (PTC-124) in these cells restores full-length protein expression and WRN functionality.

Five mutations - [Delta]F508, G542X, W1282X, N1303K, and 3849 + 10kb C[yields]T-were found to account for 97% of the CF alleles in the Ashkenazi Jews. In contrast, of the 11 mutations tested, only [Delta]F508 was detected in Jewish patients of Sephardic or Oriental origin, accounting for 43% of the CF alleles. Four mutations - [Delta]F508, G542X, W1282X, and N1303K- accounted for 55% of the CF alleles in Arab patients. In a pilot screening study,moreÂ Â» a random sample of 424 Ashkenazi individuals was analyzed for three mutations - [Delta]F508, W128X, and G542X. Thirteen individuals were detected as heterozygotes (six for [Delta]F508 and seven for W1282X), predicting a heterozygote frequency of 1:29. This is similar to the frequency of carriers in the Caucasian population of northern European ancestry. On the basis of these data, the Ashkenazi populations is considered to be a candidate for CF heterozygote screening. 32 refs., 2 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nTargeting Nonsense Mutations in Diseases with Translational Read-Through-Inducing Drugs (TRIDs).\n\nPubMed\n\nNagel-Wolfrum, Kerstin; MÃ¶ller, Fabian; Penner, Inessa; Baasov, Timor; Wolfrum, Uwe\n\n2016-04-01\n\nIn recent years, remarkable advances in the ability to diagnose genetic disorders have been made. The identification of disease-causing genes allows the development of gene-specific therapies with the ultimate goal to develop personalized medicines for each patient according to their own specific genetic defect. In-depth genotyping of many different genes has revealed that ~12% of inherited genetic disorders are caused by in-frame nonsense mutations. Nonsense (non-coding) mutations are caused by point mutations, which generate premature termination codons (PTCs) that cause premature translational termination of the mRNA, and subsequently inhibit normal full-length protein expression. Recently, a gene-based therapeutic approach for genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations has emerged, namely the so-called translational read-through (TR) therapy. Read-through therapy is based on the discovery that small molecules, known as TR-inducing drugs (TRIDs), allow the translation machinery to suppress a nonsense codon, elongate the nascent peptide chain, and consequently result in the synthesis of full-length protein. Several TRIDs are currently under investigation and research has been performed on several genetic disorders caused by nonsense mutations over the years. These findings have raised hope for the usage of TR therapy as a gene-based pharmacogenetic therapy for nonsense mutations in various genes responsible for a variety of genetic diseases.\n\nA homozygous nonsense CEP250 mutation combined with a heterozygous nonsense C2orf71 mutation is associated with atypical Usher syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhateb, Samer; Zelinger, Lina; Mizrahi-Meissonnier, Liliana; Ayuso, Carmen; Koenekoop, Robert K; Laxer, Uri; Gross, Menachem; Banin, Eyal; Sharon, Dror\n\n2014-07-01\n\nUsher syndrome (USH) is a heterogeneous group of inherited retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) caused by mutations in at least 12 genes. Our aim is to identify additional USH-related genes. Clinical examination included visual acuity test, funduscopy and electroretinography. Genetic analysis included homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing (WES). A combination of homozygosity mapping and WES in a large consanguineous family of Iranian Jewish origin revealed nonsense mutations in two ciliary genes: c.3289C>T (p.Q1097*) in C2orf71 and c.3463C>T (p.R1155*) in centrosome-associated protein CEP250 (C-Nap1). The latter has not been associated with any inherited disease and the c.3463C>T mutation was absent in control chromosomes. Patients who were double homozygotes had SNHL accompanied by early-onset and severe RP, while patients who were homozygous for the CEP250 mutation and carried a single mutant C2orf71 allele had SNHL with mild retinal degeneration. No ciliary structural abnormalities in the respiratory system were evident by electron microscopy analysis. CEP250 expression analysis of the mutant allele revealed the generation of a truncated protein lacking the NEK2-phosphorylation region. A homozygous nonsense CEP250 mutation, in combination with a heterozygous C2orf71 nonsense mutation, causes an atypical form of USH, characterised by early-onset SNHL and a relatively mild RP. The severe retinal involvement in the double homozygotes indicates an additive effect caused by nonsense mutations in genes encoding ciliary proteins. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

PHEX has been identified as the gene defective in this phosphate wasting disorder leading to decreased renal phosphate reabsorption, hypophosphatemia and inappropriate concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in regard to hypophosphatemia. Clinical manifestation are skeletal deformities, short stature, osteomalacia, dental abscesses, bone pain, and loss of hearing. We report 3 cases of hypophosphatemic rickets with genetic mutational analysis of the PHEX gene. In 1 male patient an unknown nonsense mutation was found in exon 7, codon 245 (c.735T>G, Tyr245Term, Y245X). In both female patients known mutations were found: c.682delTC (exon 6, codon 228) and c.1952G>C (exon 19, codon 651, R651P). Age at diagnosis ranged from early childhood to the age of 35 years. Clinical complications were hip replacement in 1 patient, mild nephrocalcinosis in 2 patients and loss of hearing in 1 patient. All 3 patients have been treated with phosphate supplements and receive 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Under this regimen all patients show stable biochemical markers with slight hyperparathyreoidism. In all patients at least one family member is affected by rickets, as well. We report a novel nonsense mutation of PHEX that has not been identified so far. The recent discovery of FGF23 and MEPE has changed our understanding of the kidney-bone metabolism, but also raises concerns about the efficacy of current therapeutic regimens that are reviewed in this context.

Cereblon is a substrate receptor for the Cullin-RING E3 ligase complex and couples the ubiquitin ligase to specific ubiquitination targets. The CRBN nonsense mutation (R419X) results in a protein lacking 24 amino acids at its C terminus. Although this mutation has been linked to mild mental retardation, the mechanism by which the mutation affects CRBN function is unknown. Here, we used biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches to explore the function of this mutant. We show that the protein retains its ability to assemble into a Cullin-RING E3 ligase complex and catalyzes the ubiquitination of CRBN-target proteins. However, we find that this mutant exhibits markedly increased levels of autoubiquitination and is more readily degraded by the proteasome than the wild type protein. We also show that the level of the mutant protein can be restored by a treatment of cells with a clinically utilized proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that this agent may be useful for the treatment of mental retardation associated with the CRBN R419X mutation. These data demonstrate that enhanced autoubiquitination and degradation account for the defect in CRBN activity that leads to mental retardation.

Identification of a novel c.7006C>T [p.R2317X] mutation and expression of minigenes containing nonsense mutations in exon 7.\n\nPubMed\n\nMachiavelli, Gloria A; Caputo, Mariela; Rivolta, Carina M; Olcese, MarÃ­a C; GruÃ±eiro-Papendieck, Laura; Chiesa, Ana; GonzÃ¡lez-Sarmiento, Rogelio; Targovnik, HÃ©ctor M\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThyroglobulin (TG) deficiency is an autosomal-recessive disorder that results in thyroid dyshormonogenesis. A number of distinct mutations have been identified as causing human hypothyroid goitre. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize new mutations in the TG gene in an attempt to increase the understanding of the genetic mechanism responsible for this disorder. A total of six patients from four nonconsanguineous families with marked impairment of TG synthesis were studied. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, sequencing of DNA, genotyping, expression of chimeric minigenes and bioinformatic analysis were performed. Four different inactivating TG mutations were identified: one novel mutation (c.7006C>T [p.R2317X]) and three previously reported (c.886C>T [p.R277X], c.6701C>A [p.A2215D] and c.6725G>A [p.R2223H]). Consequently, one patient carried a compound heterozygous for p.R2223H/p.R2317X mutations; two brothers showed a homozygous p.A2215D substitution and the remaining three patients, from two families with typical phenotype, had a single p.R277X mutated allele. We also showed functional evidences that premature stop codons inserted at different positions in exon 7, which disrupt exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequences, do not interfere with exon definition and processing. In this study, we have identified a novel nonsense mutation p.R2317X in the acetylcholinesterase homology domain of TG. We have also observed that nonsense mutations do not interfere with the pre-mRNA splicing of exon 7. The results are in accordance with previous observations confirming the genetic heterogeneity of TG defects.\n\nNovel CREB3L3 Nonsense Mutation in a Family With Dominant Hypertriglyceridemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nCefalÃ¹, Angelo B; Spina, Rossella; Noto, Davide; Valenti, Vincenza; Ingrassia, Valeria; Giammanco, Antonina; Panno, Maria D; Ganci, Antonina; Barbagallo, Carlo M; Averna, Maurizio R\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein 3-like 3 (CREB3L3) is a novel candidate gene for dominant hypertriglyceridemia. To date, only 4 kindred with dominant hypertriglyceridemia have been found to be carriers of 2 nonsense mutations in CREB3L3 gene (245fs and W46X). We investigated a family in which hypertriglyceridemia displayed an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The proband was a 49-year-old woman with high plasma triglycerides (â¤1300 mg/dL; 14.68 mmol/L). Her father had a history of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, and her 51-year-old brother had triglycerides levels as high as 1600 mg/dL (18.06 mmol/L). To identify the causal mutation in this family, we analyzed the candidate genes of recessive and dominant forms of primary hypertriglyceridemia by direct sequencing. The sequencing of CREB3L3 gene led to the discovery of a novel minute frame shift mutation in exon 3 of CREB3L3 gene, predicted to result in the formation of a truncated protein devoid of function (c.359delG-p.K120fsX20). Heterozygosity for the c.359delG mutation resulted in a severe phenotype occurring later in life in the proband and her brother and a good response to diet and a hypotriglyceridemic treatment. The same mutation was detected in a 13-year-old daughter who to date is normotriglyceridemic. We have identified a novel pathogenic mutation in CREB3L3 gene in a family with dominant hypertriglyceridemia with a variable pattern of penetrance.

Mutations in the PHEX gene are major causes of XLHR. Herein, we clinically characterized four unrelated families with hypophosphatemia, bone abnormalities, short stature, and dentin malformation. Mutational analysis of the PHEX gene using Sanger sequencing revealed three recurrent mutations (c.2197T>C, c.1646G>C, and c.2198G>A) and a de novo nonsense mutation (c.148A>T). The novel mutation was not found in any of the unaffected family members or in the 100 healthy controls and was predicted to produce a truncated protein (p.K50X), a truncated form of the PHEX protein caused by nonsense mutations has been frequently detected in XLHR individuals. Thus, our work indicated that the c.148A>T (p.K50X) mutation was the likely pathogenic mutation in individual III-2 in family 2, and that PHEX gene mutations were responsible for XLHR in these Chinese families. These findings expand the mutation spectrum of PHEX and may help us to understand the molecular basis of XLHR in order to facilitate genetic counseling. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods Twenty-two members of a three-generation pedigree were recruited, clinical examinations were performed, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. All members were genotyped with polymorphic microsatellite markers adjacent to each of the known cataract-related genes. Linkage analysis was performed after genotyping. Candidate genes were screened for mutation using direct sequencing. Individuals were screened for presence of a mutation by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Results Linkage analysis identified a maximum LOD score of 3.31 (recombination fraction [Î¸]=0.0) with marker D22S1167 on chromosome 22, which flanks the Î²-crystallin gene cluster (CRYBB3, CRYBB2, CRYBB1, and CRYBA4). Sequencing the coding regions and the flanking intronic sequences of these four candidate genes identified a novel, heterozygous CâT transition in exon 6 of CRYBB1 in the affected individuals of the family. This single nucleotide change introduced a novel BfaI site and was predicted to result in a nonsense mutation at codon 223 that changed a phylogenetically conserved amino acid to a stop codon (p.Q223X). RFLP analysis confirmed that this mutation co-segregated with the disease phenotype in all available family members and was not found in 100 normal unrelated individuals from the same ethnic background. Conclusions This study has identified a novel nonsense mutation in CRYBB1 (p.Q223X) associated with autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract.

Whether monoallelic BLM mutations predispose to breast cancer has been a long-standing question. A nonsense mutation, p.Q548X, has recently been associated with an increased risk for breast cancer in a Russian case-control study. In the present work, we have investigated the prevalence of this Slavic BLM founder mutation in a total of 3,188 breast cancer cases and 2,458 controls from Bashkortostan, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. The p.Q548X allele was most frequent in Russian patients (0.8 %) but was also prevalent in Byelorussian and Ukrainian patients (0.5 and 0.6 %, respectively), whereas it was absent in Altaic or other non-European subpopulations. In a combined analysis of our four case-control series, the p.Q548X mutation was significantly associated with breast cancer (Mantel-Haenszel OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2; 21.9, p = 0.03). A meta-analysis with the previous study from the St. Petersburg area corroborates the association (OR 5.7, 95 % CI 2.0; 15.9, p = 3.7 Ã 10(-4)). A meta-analysis for all published truncating mutations further supports the association of BLM with breast cancer, with an estimated two- to five-fold increase in risk (OR 3.3, 95 %CI 1.9; 5.6, p = 1.9 Ã 10(-5)). Altogether, these data indicate that BLM is not only a gene for Bloom's syndrome but also might represent a breast cancer susceptibility gene.\n\nMutations in eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 act as general nonsense suppressors in Drosophila.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChao, Anna T; Dierick, Herman A; Addy, Tracie M; Bejsovec, Amy\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn a screen for suppressors of the Drosophila wingless(PE4) nonsense allele, we isolated mutations in the two components that form eukaryotic release factor. eRF1 and eRF3 comprise the translation termination complex that recognizes stop codons and catalyzes the release of nascent polypeptide chains from ribosomes. Mutations disrupting the Drosophila eRF1 and eRF3 show a strong maternal-effect nonsense suppression due to readthrough of stop codons and are zygotically lethal during larval stages. We tested nonsense mutations in wg and in other embryonically acting genes and found that different stop codons can be suppressed but only a subset of nonsense alleles are subject to suppression. We suspect that the context of the stop codon is significant: nonsense alleles sensitive to suppression by eRF1 and eRF3 encode stop codons that are immediately followed by a cytidine. Such suppressible alleles appear to be intrinsically weak, with a low level of readthrough that is enhanced when translation termination is disrupted. Thus the eRF1 and eRF3 mutations provide a tool for identifying nonsense alleles that are leaky. Our findings have important implications for assigning null mutant phenotypes and for selecting appropriate alleles to use in suppressor screens. PMID:14573473\n\nA mechanism for exon skipping caused by nonsense or missense mutations in BRCA1 and other genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, H X; Cartegni, L; Zhang, M Q; Krainer, A R\n\n2001-01-01\n\nPoint mutations can generate defective and sometimes harmful proteins. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway minimizes the potential damage caused by nonsense mutations. In-frame nonsense codons located at a minimum distance upstream of the last exon-exon junction are recognized as premature termination codons (PTCs), targeting the mRNA for degradation. Some nonsense mutations cause skipping of one or more exons, presumably during pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus; this phenomenon is termed nonsense-mediated altered splicing (NAS), and its underlying mechanism is unclear. By analyzing NAS in BRCA1, we show here that inappropriate exon skipping can be reproduced in vitro, and results from disruption of a splicing enhancer in the coding sequence. Enhancers can be disrupted by single nonsense, missense and translationally silent point mutations, without recognition of an open reading frame as such. These results argue against a nuclear reading-frame scanning mechanism for NAS. Coding-region single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) within exonic splicing enhancers or silencers may affect the patterns or efficiency of mRNA splicing, which may in turn cause phenotypic variability and variable penetrance of mutations elsewhere in a gene.\n\nBeneficial read-through of a USH1C nonsense mutation by designed aminoglycoside NB30 in the retina.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoldmann, Tobias; Rebibo-Sabbah, Annie; Overlack, Nora; Nudelman, Igor; Belakhov, Valery; Baasov, Timor; Ben-Yosef, Tamar; Wolfrum, Uwe; Nagel-Wolfrum, Kerstin\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe human Usher syndrome (USH) is the most frequent cause of inherited combined deaf-blindness. USH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, assigned to three clinical types. The most severe type is USH1, characterized by profound inner ear defects and retinitis pigmentosa. Thus far, no effective treatment for the ophthalmic component of USH exists. The p.R31X nonsense mutation in USH1C leads to a disease causing premature termination of gene translation. Here, we investigated the capability of the novel synthetic aminoglycoside NB30 for the translational read-through of the USH1C-p.R31X nonsense mutation as a retinal therapy option. Read-through of p.R31X by three commercial, clinically applied aminoglycosides and the synthetic derivative NB30 was validated in vitro, in cell culture, and in retinal explants. Restoration of harmonin functions was monitored in GST pull-downs (scaffold function) and by F-actin bundling analysis in HEK293T cells. Biocompatibility of aminoglycosides was determined in retinal explants by TUNEL assays. In vitro translation and analyses of transfected HEK293T cells revealed a dose-dependent read-through by all aminoglycosides. In addition, gentamicin, paromomycin, and NB30 induced read-through of p.R31X in mouse retinal explants. The read-through of p.R31X restored harmonin protein function. In contrast to all commercial aminoglycosides NB30 showed good biocompatibility. Commercial aminoglycosides and NB30 induced significant read-through of the USH1C-p.R31X nonsense mutation. However, the observed read-through efficiency, along with its significantly reduced toxicity and good biocompatibility, indicate that the novel derivate NB30 represents a better choice than commercial aminoglycosides in a read-through therapy of USH1C and other ocular diseases.\n\nNonsense mutations in the PAX3 gene cause Waardenburg syndrome type I in two Chinese patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Shu-Zhi; Cao, Ju-Yang; Zhang, Rui-Ning; Liu, Li-Xian; Liu, Xin; Zhang, Xin; Kang, Dong-Yang; Li, Mei; Han, Dong-Yi; Yuan, Hui-Jun; Yang, Wei-Yan\n\n2007-01-05\n\nWaardenburg syndrome type I (WS1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, pigmental abnormalities of the eye, hair and skin, and dystopia canthorum. The gene mainly responsible for WS1 is PAX3 which is involved in melanocytic development and survival. Mutations of PAX3 have been reported in familiar or sporadic patients with WS1 in several populations of the world except Chinese. In order to explore the genetic background of Chinese WS1 patients, a mutation screening of PAX3 gene was carried out in four WS1 pedigrees. A questionnaire survey and comprehensive clinical examination were conducted in four Chinese pedigrees of WS1. Genomic DNA from each patient and their family members was extracted and exons of PAX3 were amplified by PCR. PCR fragments were ethanol-purified and sequenced in both directions on an ABI_Prism 3100 DNA sequencer with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit. The sequences were obtained and aligned to the wild type sequence of PAX3 with the GeneTool program. Two nonsense PAX3 mutations have been found in the study population. One is heterozygous for a novel nonsense mutation S209X. The other is heterozygous for a previously reported mutation in European population R223X. Both mutations create stop codons leading to truncation of the PAX3 protein. This is the first demonstration of PAX3 mutations in Chinese WS1 patients and one of the few examples of an identical mutation of PAX3 occurred in different populations.\n\nAtaluren treatment of patients with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBushby, Katharine; Finkel, Richard; Wong, Brenda; Barohn, Richard; Campbell, Craig; Comi, Giacomo P; Connolly, Anne M; Day, John W; Flanigan, Kevin M; Goemans, Nathalie; Jones, Kristi J; Mercuri, Eugenio; Quinlivan, Ros; Renfroe, James B; Russman, Barry; Ryan, Monique M; Tulinius, Mar; Voit, Thomas; Moore, Steven A; Lee Sweeney, H; Abresch, Richard T; Coleman, Kim L; Eagle, Michelle; Florence, Julaine; Gappmaier, Eduard; Glanzman, Allan M; Henricson, Erik; Barth, Jay; Elfring, Gary L; Reha, Allen; Spiegel, Robert J; O'donnell, Michael W; Peltz, Stuart W; Mcdonald, Craig M\n\n2014-10-01\n\nDystrophinopathy is a rare, severe muscle disorder, and nonsense mutations are found in 13% of cases. Ataluren was developed to enable ribosomal readthrough of premature stop codons in nonsense mutation (nm) genetic disorders. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study; males â¥ 5 years with nm-dystrophinopathy received study drug orally 3 times daily, ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg (N=57); ataluren 20, 20, 40 mg/kg (N=60); or placebo (N=57) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at Week 48. Ataluren was generally well tolerated. The primary endpoint favored ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg versus placebo; the week 48 6MWD Î=31.3 meters, post hoc P=0.056. Secondary endpoints (timed function tests) showed meaningful differences between ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg, and placebo. As the first investigational new drug targeting the underlying cause of nm-dystrophinopathy, ataluren offers promise as a treatment for this orphan genetic disorder with high unmet medical need.

The disorder results from mutations in the KIND1 gene, encoding the protein kindlin-1, a recently characterized 677-amino acid protein involved in anchorage of the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. We report the clinical features of an 11-year-old boy with Kindler syndrome from a consanguineous Indian family and the identification of a homozygous nonsense mutation (C468X) in exon 12 of the KIND1 gene in his genomic DNA. This mutation has not been described previously but is similar to the 17 previously published KIND1 mutations that are all predicted to lead to loss of kindlin-1 protein expression and function. The clinical features in this boy highlight the relevance of kindlin-1 in skin biology, specifically to epidermal adhesion and response to acute and chronic sun exposure. Delineation of this new pathogenic mutation in KIND1 is also useful for genetic counselling in this family and in assessing carrier status in unaffected family members.\n\nA novel GATA3 nonsense mutation in a newly diagnosed adult patient of hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nNanba, Kazutaka; Usui, Takeshi; Nakamura, Michikazu; Toyota, Yuko; Hirota, Keisho; Tamanaha, Tamiko; Kawashima, Sachiko-Tsukamoto; Nakao, Kanako; Yuno, Akiko; Tagami, Tetsuya; Naruse, Mitsuhide; Shimatsu, Akira\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a GATA3 gene mutation. Here we report a novel mutation of GATA3 in a patient diagnosed with HDR syndrome at the age of 58 with extensive intracranial calcification. A 58-year-old Japanese man showed severe hypocalcemia and marked calcification in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, deep white matter, and gray-white junction on computed tomography (CT). The serum intact parathyroid hormone level was relatively low against low serum calcium concentration. The patient had been diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural deafness in childhood and had a family history of hearing disorders. Imaging studies revealed no renal anomalies. The patient was diagnosed with HDR syndrome, and genetic testing was performed. Genetic analysis of GATA3 showed a novel nonsense mutation at codon 198 (S198X) in exon 3. The S198X mutation leads to a loss of two zinc finger deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding domains and is considered to be responsible for HDR syndrome. We identified a novel nonsense mutation of GATA3 in an adult patient with HDR syndrome who showed extensive intracranial calcification.\n\nIn vitro and ex vivo suppression by aminoglycosides of PCDH15 nonsense mutations underlying type 1 Usher syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nRebibo-Sabbah, Annie; Nudelman, Igor; Ahmed, Zubair M; Baasov, Timor; Ben-Yosef, Tamar\n\n2007-11-01\n\nType 1 Usher syndrome (USH1) is a recessively inherited condition, characterized by profound prelingual deafness, vestibular areflexia, and prepubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). While the auditory component of USH1 can be treated by cochlear implants, to date there is no effective treatment for RP. USH1 can be caused by mutations in each of at least six genes. While truncating mutations of these genes cause USH1, some missense mutations of the same genes cause nonsyndromic deafness. These observations suggest that partial or low level activity of the encoded proteins may be sufficient for normal retinal function, although not for normal hearing. In individuals with USH1 due to nonsense mutations, interventions enabling partial translation of a full-length functional protein may delay the onset and/or progression of RP. One such possible therapeutic approach is suppression of nonsense mutations by small molecules such as aminoglycosides. We decided to test this approach as a potential therapy for RP in USH1 patients due to nonsense mutations. We initially focused on nonsense mutations of the PCDH15 gene, underlying USH1F. Here, we show suppression of several PCDH15 nonsense mutations, both in vitro and ex vivo. Suppression was achieved both by commercial aminoglycosides and by NB30, a new aminoglycoside-derivative developed by us. NB30 has reduced cytotoxicity in comparison to commercial aminoglycosides, and thus may be more efficiently used for therapeutic purposes. The research described here has important implications for the development of targeted interventions that are effective for patients with USH1 caused by various nonsense mutations.\n\nA novel nonsense mutation in the DMP1 gene in a Japanese family with autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoshida, Ryusuke; Yamaguchi, Hideki; Yamasaki, Koji; Tsuchimochi, Wakaba; Yonekawa, Tadato; Nakazato, Masamitsu\n\n2010-09-01\n\nAutosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is an extremely rare disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized by hypophosphatemia resulting from renal phosphate wasting. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a noncollagenous extracellular protein, plays critical roles in bone mineralization and phosphate homeostasis. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in DMP1 gene have been identified as the molecular cause of ARHR. Here, we describe a Japanese family that includes two ARHR-affected siblings carrying a novel mutation of the DMP1 gene. The patients were a 53-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man with short stature and skeletal deformities who were the offspring of a first-cousin marriage. Biochemical examination revealed hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate excretion and low levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D. Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium excretion were within the normal range, leading to clinical diagnosis of ARHR. Sequence analysis of peripheral leukocytes from the patients revealed that they carried a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the DMP1 gene (98G>A, W33X), which leads to a truncated DMP protein with no putative biological function. Unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation. This is the first report of a Japanese family with ARHR carrying a novel mutation of the DMP1 gene.\n\nMissense and nonsense mutations in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene of different goat breeds: association with red and black coat colour phenotypes but with unexpected evidences\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground Agouti and Extension loci control the relative amount of eumelanin and pheomelanin production in melanocytes that, in turn, affects pigmentation of skin and hair. The Extension locus encodes the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) whose permanent activation, caused by functional mutations, results in black coat colour, whereas other inactivating mutations cause red coat colour in different mammals. Results The whole coding region of the MC1R gene was sequenced in goats of six different breeds showing different coat colours (Girgentana, white cream with usually small red spots in the face; Maltese, white with black cheeks and ears; Derivata di Siria, solid red; Murciano-Granadina, solid black or solid brown; Camosciata delle Alpi, brown with black stripes; Saanen, white; F1 goats and the parental animals). Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified: one nonsense mutation (p.Q225X), three missense mutations (p.A81V, p.F250V, and p.C267W), and one silent mutation. The stop codon at position 225 should cause the production of a shorter MC1R protein whose functionality may be altered. These SNPs were investigated in a larger sample of animals belonging to the six breeds. The Girgentana breed was almost fixed for the p.225X allele. However, there was not complete association between the presence of red spots in the face and the presence of this allele in homozygous condition. The same allele was identified in the Derivata di Siria breed. However, its frequency was only 33%, despite the fact that these animals are completely red. The p.267W allele was present in all Murciano-Granadina black goats, whereas it was never identified in the brown ones. Moreover, the same substitution was present in almost all Maltese goats providing evidence of association between this mutation and black coat colour. Conclusion According to the results obtained in the investigated goat breeds, MC1R mutations may determine eumelanic and pheomelanic phenotypes.

However, KISS1R mutations remain rare. The aim of this study was to understand the molecular basis of normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Clinical characteristics, hormonal studies and genetic analyses of seven cases with idiopathic normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH) from three unrelated consanguineous families are presented. One male presented with absence of pubertal onset and required surgery for severe penoscrotal hypospadias and cryptorchidism, while other two males had absence of pubertal onset. Two of four female cases required replacement therapy for pubertal onset and maintenance, whereas the other two had spontaneous pubertal onset but incomplete maturation. In sequence analysis, we identified a novel homozygous nonsense (p.Y323X) mutation (c.C969A) in the last exon of the KISS1R gene in all clinically affected cases. We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in the KISS1R gene in three unrelated families with nIHH, which enabled us to observe the phenotypic consequences of this rare condition. Escape from nonsense-mediated decay, and thus production of abnormal proteins, may account for the variable severity of the phenotype. Although KISS1R mutations are extremely rare and can cause a heterogeneous phenotype, analysis of the KISS1R gene should be a part of genetic analysis of patients with nIHH, to allow better understanding of phenotype-genotype relationship of KISS1R mutations and the underlying genetic basis of patients with nIHH.

TCS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and haploinsufficiency of the TCOF1 gene product treacle is proposed to be etiologically involved. Mutational analysis of the TCOF1 gene was done in 10 patients diagnosed with TCS using single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. Among these 10 patients, a novel 9 bp deletion was found, together with a previously reported 2 bp deletion, a novel missense mutation and a novel nonsense mutation in three different families. Familial studies allowed judgment of whether these abnormal findings were responsible for the TCS phenotype, or not. The 9 bp deletion of three amino acids Lys-Glu-Lys (1378-1380), which was located in the nuclear localization domain of treacle, seemed not essential for the treacle function. In contrast, the novel mutation of Ala26Val is considered to affect the LisH domain, an important domain of treacle. All of the mutations thus far detected in exon 5 have resulted in frameshift, but a nonsense mutation was detected (Lys159Stop). The information obtained in the present study provides additional insights into the functional domains of treacle.\n\nA Nonsense Mutation in Mycobacterium marinum That Is Suppressible by a Novel Mechanism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilliams, Emily A.; Mba Medie, Felix; Bosserman, Rachel E.; Johnson, Benjamin K.; Reyna, Cristal; Ferrell, Micah J.; Champion, Matthew M.; Abramovitch, Robert B.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Mycobacterial pathogens use the ESAT-6 system 1 (Esx-1) exporter to promote virulence. Previously, we used gene disruption and complementation to conclude that the MMAR_0039 gene in Mycobacterium marinum is required to promote Esx-1 export. Here we applied molecular genetics, proteomics, and whole-genome sequencing to demonstrate that the MMAR_0039 gene is not required for Esx-1 secretion or virulence. These findings suggest that we initially observed an indirect mechanism of genetic complementation. We identified a spontaneous nonsense mutation in a known Esx-1-associated gene which causes a loss of Esx-1 activity. We show that the Esx-1 function was restored by nonsense suppression. Moreover, we identified a polar mutation in the ppsC gene which reduced cellular impermeability but did not impact cytotoxicity in macrophages. Our studies reveal insight into Esx-1 export, nonsense suppression, and cell envelope lipid biogenesis.

One noncanonical function of BMP signaling regulates biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs. We have previously shown that this function is abrogated in patients with HPAH, making it a highly sensitive readout of BMP pathway integrity. Ataluren (PTC124) is an investigational drug that permits ribosomal readthrough of premature stop codons, resulting in a full-length protein. It exhibits oral bioavailability and limited toxicity in human trials. Here, we tested ataluren in lung- or blood-derived cells from patients with HPAH with nonsense mutations in BMPR2 (n = 6) or SMAD9 (n = 1). Ataluren significantly increased BMP-mediated microRNA processing in six of the seven cases. Moreover, rescue was achieved even for mutations exhibiting significant nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Response to ataluren was dose dependent, and complete correction was achieved at therapeutic doses currently used in clinical trials for cystic fibrosis. BMP receptor (BMPR)-II protein levels were normalized and ligand-dependent phosphorylation of downstream target Smads was increased. Furthermore, the usually hyperproliferative phenotype of pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells was reversed by ataluren. These results indicate that ataluren can effectively suppress a high proportion of BMPR2 and SMAD9 nonsense mutations and correct BMP signaling in vitro. Approximately 29% of all HPAH mutations are nonsense point mutations. In light of this, we propose ataluren as a potential new personalized therapy for this significant subgroup of patients with PAH.\n\nDifferential protein structural disturbances and suppression of assembly partners produced by nonsense GABRG2 epilepsy mutations: implications for disease phenotypic heterogeneity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Juexin; Shen, Dingding; Xia, Geqing; Shen, Wangzhen; Macdonald, Robert L.; Xu, Dong; Kang, Jing-Qiong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMutations in GABAA receptor subunit genes are frequently associated with epilepsy, and nonsense mutations in GABRG2 are associated with several epilepsy syndromes including childhood absence epilepsy, generalized tonic clonic seizures and the epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet syndrome. The molecular basis for the phenotypic heterogeneity of mutations is unclear. Here we focused on three nonsense mutations in GABRG2 (GABRG2(R136*), GABRG2(Q390*) and GABRG2(W429*)) associated with epilepsies of different severities. Structural modeling and structure-based analysis indicated that the surface of the wild-type Î³2 subunit was naturally hydrophobic, which is suitable to be buried in the cell membrane. Different mutant Î³2 subunits had different stabilities and different interactions with their wild-type subunit binding partners because they adopted different conformations and had different surface hydrophobicities and different tendency to dimerize. We utilized flow cytometry and biochemical approaches in combination with lifted whole cell patch-clamp recordings. We demonstrated that the truncated subunits had no to minimal surface expression and unchanged or reduced surface expression of wild-type partnering subunits. The amplitudes of GABA-evoked currents from the mutant Î±1Î²2Î³2(R136*), Î±1Î²2Î³2(Q390*) and Î±1Î²2Î³2(W429*) receptors were reduced compared to the currents from Î±1Î²2Î³2 receptors but with differentially reduced levels. This thus suggests differential protein structure disturbances are correlated with disease severity. PMID:27762395\n\nThomsen or Becker myotonia? A novel autosomal recessive nonsense mutation in the CLCN1 gene associated with a mild phenotype.\n\nPubMed\n\nGurgel-Giannetti, Juliana; Senkevics, Adriano S; Zilbersztajn-Gotlieb, Dinorah; Yamamoto, Lydia U; Muniz, Viviane P; Pavanello, Rita C M; Oliveira, Acary B; Zatz, Mayana; Vainzof, Mariz\n\n2012-02-01\n\nWe describe a large Brazilian consanguineous kindred with 3 clinically affected patients with a Thomsen myotonia phenotype. They carry a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the CLCN1 gene (K248X). None of the 6 heterozygote carriers show any sign of myotonia on clinical evaluation or electromyography. These findings confirm the autosomal recessive inheritance of the novel mutation in this family, as well as the occurrence of phenotypic variability in the autosomal recessive forms of myotonia.

We used whole-exome sequencing to identify the molecular basis of APSS in a consanguineous Jordanian-American pedigree. We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (p.Lys22X) in the CSTA gene, encoding cystatin A, that was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Cystatin A is a protease inhibitor found in the cornified cell envelope, and loss-of-function mutations have previously been reported in two cases of exfoliative ichthyosis. Our study expands the molecular pathology of APSS and demonstrates the value of next-generation sequencing in the genetic characterization of inherited skin diseases.

Most affected individuals also have Hirschsprung disease and/or gyral abnormalities of the brain. This syndrome has been associated with KIAA1279 gene mutations at 10q22.1. Here we report a 16 yr old male patient referred to Center for Comprehensive Genetic Services, Tehran, Iran in 2015 with cardinal features of GOSHS in addition to refractory seizures. Whole exome sequencing in the patient revealed a novel nonsense (stop gain) homozygous mutation in KIAA1279 gene (KIAA1279: NM_015634:exon6:c.C976T:p.Q326X). Considering the wide range of phenotypic variations in GOSHS, relying on phenotypic characteristics for discrimination of GOSH from similar syndromes may lead to misdiagnosis. Consequently, molecular diagnostic tools would help in accurate diagnosis of such overlapping phenotypes.\n\nCommon pathological mutations in PQBP1 induce nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and enhance exclusion of the mutant exon.\n\nPubMed\n\nMusante, Luciana; Kunde, Stella-Amrei; Sulistio, Tina O; Fischer, Ute; Grimme, Astrid; Frints, Suzanna G M; Schwartz, Charles E; MartÃ­nez, Francisco; Romano, Corrado; Ropers, Hans-Hilger; Kalscheuer, Vera M\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) gene plays an important role in X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Nine of the thirteen PQBP1 mutations known to date affect the AG hexamer in exon 4 and cause frameshifts introducing premature termination codons (PTCs). However, the phenotype in this group of patients is variable. To investigate the pathology of these PQBP1 mutations, we evaluated their consequences on mRNA and protein expression. RT-PCRs revealed mutation-specific reduction of PQBP1 mRNAs carrying the PTCs that can be partially restored by blocking translation, thus indicating a role for the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. In addition, these mutations resulted in altered levels of PQBP1 transcripts that skipped exon 4, probably as a result of altering important splicing motifs via nonsense-associated altered splicing (NAS). This hypothesis is supported by transfection experiments using wild-type and mutant PQBP1 minigenes. Moreover, we show that a truncated PQBP1 protein is indeed present in the patients. Remarkably, patients with insertion/deletion mutations in the AG hexamer express significantly increased levels of a PQBP1 isoform, which is very likely encoded by the transcripts without exon 4, confirming the findings at the mRNA level. Our study provides significant insight into the early events contributing to the pathogenesis of the PQBP1 related XLMR disease.\n\nTreacher Collins syndrome with craniosynostosis, choanal atresia, and esophageal regurgitation caused by a novel nonsense mutation in TCOF1.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoriuchi, Katsumi; Ariga, Tadashi; Fujioka, Hirotaka; Kawashima, Kunihiro; Yamamoto, Yuhei; Igawa, Hiroharu; Sakiyama, Yukio; Sugihara, Tsuneki\n\n2004-07-15\n\nTreacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is caused by mutations in TCOF1 of the nonsense, small deletion, and small insertion types, which most likely result in haploinsufficiency. We report a novel de novo nonsense mutation 2731C --> T, resulting in Arg911Stop, which truncates the protein. Our patient had the classic findings of TCS, but with documented craniosynostosis, choanal atresia, and esophageal regurgitation.

We sought to characterize the genetic defect involved in a new form of X-linked immunodeficiency. We performed genetic analyses and an exhaustive phenotypic and functional characterization of the lymphocyte compartment. We observed hemizygous mutations in the moesin (MSN) gene (located on the X chromosome and coding for MSN) in all 7 patients. Six of the latter had the same missense mutation, which led to an amino acid substitution (R171W) in the MSN four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin domain. The seventh patient had a nonsense mutation leading to a premature stop codon mutation (R533X). The naive T-cell counts were particularly low for age, and most CD8 + TÂ cells expressed the senescence marker CD57. This phenotype was associated with impaired T-cell proliferation, which was rescued by expression of wild-type MSN. MSN-deficient TÂ cells also displayed poor chemokine receptor expression, increased adhesion molecule expression, and altered migration and adhesion capacities. Our observations establish a causal link between an ezrin-radixin-moesin protein mutation and a primary immunodeficiency that could be referred to as X-linked moesin-associated immunodeficiency.

Type X collagen is an extracellular matrix protein expressed exclusively by hypertrophic chondrocytes. We have previously identified four mutations in the type X collagen gene (COL10A1) in patients with SMCD. Each of these mutations, as well as another three reported by other investigators, are in the carboxy-terminal non-collagenous domain (NC1). Here, we present data for another three mutations each predicted to cause premature termination of translation within the NC1 domain. Two are nonsense mutations, Y628XmoreÂ Â» and W651X, while the third is a frameshift resulting from the deletion of two nucleotides, 1856delCC. Each of these mutations occurred de novo, resulting in sporadic cases of SMCD. Four frameshift mutations have now been reported to initiate within 10bp of each other in the NC1 domain, namely 1865delC, 1856delCC, 1856del13 and 1866del10. These findings further support the hypothesis that SMCD is the result of the mutant type X collagen molecule being unable to participate in trimerization, although a dominant-negative model of disease pathogenesis has not been formally excluded.Â«Â less\n\nMutations in the gene for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with different clinical phenotypes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBraun, A.; Ambach, H.; Kammerer, S.\n\nRecently, the gene for the most common peroxisomal disorder, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. We analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription PCR, SSCP, and DNA sequencing in five patients with different clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ALD, adrenomyecloneuropathy (AMN), and {open_quotes}Addison disease only{close_quotes} (AD) phenotype. In the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ALD we identified in the 5{prime} portion of the X-ALD gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation, a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the ATP-bindingmoreÂ Â» domain of the ALD protein, and a missense mutation. In the patient with the clinical phenotype of AMN, a nonsense mutation in codon 212, along with a second site mutation at codon 178, was observed. Analysis of the patient with the ADO phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the ALDP/PMP70 comparison. The disruptive nature of two mutations (i.e., the frameshift and the nonsense mutation) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ALD and AMN further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD. Since the current biochemical techniques for X-ALD carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability, our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. 19 refs., 6 figs., 3 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nMurine knockin model for progranulin-deficient frontotemporal dementia with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNguyen, Thi A.; Zhang, Jiasheng; Devireddy, Swathi; Zhou, Ping; Karydas, Anna M.; Xu, Xialian; Miller, Bruce L.; Rigo, Frank; Ferguson, Shawn M.; Walther, Tobias C.; Farese, Robert V.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in individuals under age 60 and has no treatment or cure. Because many cases of FTD result from GRN nonsense mutations, an animal model for this type of mutation is highly desirable for understanding pathogenesis and testing therapies. Here, we generated and characterized GrnR493X knockin mice, which model the most common human GRN mutation, a premature stop codon at arginine 493 (R493X). Homozygous GrnR493X mice have markedly reduced Grn mRNA levels, lack detectable progranulin protein, and phenocopy Grn knockout mice, with CNS microgliosis, cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation, reduced synaptic density, lipofuscinosis, hyperinflammatory macrophages, excessive grooming behavior, and reduced survival. Inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by genetic, pharmacological, or antisense oligonucleotide-based approaches showed that NMD contributes to the reduced mRNA levels in GrnR493X mice and cell lines and in fibroblasts from patients containing the GRNR493X mutation. Moreover, the expressed truncated R493X mutant protein was functional in several assays in progranulin-deficient cells. Together, these findings establish a murine model for in vivo testing of NMD inhibition or other therapies as potential approaches for treating progranulin deficiency caused by the R493X mutation.

Dominant white (W) is one of several known depigmentation phenotypes in horses. It shows considerable phenotypic variation, ranging from â¼50% depigmented areas up to a completely white coat. In the horse, the four depigmentation phenotypes roan, sabino, tobiano, and dominant white were independently mapped to a chromosomal region on ECA 3 harboring the KIT gene. KIT plays an important role in melanoblast survival during embryonic development. We determined the sequence and genomic organization of the â¼82 kb equine KIT gene. A mutation analysis of all 21 KIT exons in white Franches-Montagnes Horses revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 15 (c.2151C>G, p.Y717X). We analyzed the KIT exons in horses characterized as dominant white from other populations and found three additional candidate causative mutations. Three almost completely white Arabians carried a different nonsense mutation in exon 4 (c.706A>T, p.K236X). Six Camarillo White Horses had a missense mutation in exon 12 (c.1805C>T, p.A602V), and five white Thoroughbreds had yet another missense mutation in exon 13 (c.1960G>A, p.G654R). Our results indicate that the dominant white color in Franches-Montagnes Horses is caused by a nonsense mutation in the KIT gene and that multiple independent mutations within this gene appear to be responsible for dominant white in several other modern horse populations.

This study explored the role of TCOF1 mutations in Chinese patients with TCS. Mutational analysis of the TCOF1 gene was performed in three patients using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Among these three patients, two additional TCOF1 variations, a novel 18 bp deletion and a novel 1 bp insertion mutation, were found in patient 1, together with a novel nonsense mutation (p.Ser476X) and a previously reported 4 bp deletion (c.1872_1875delTGAG) in other patients. Pedigree analysis allowed for prediction of the character of the mutation, which was either pathological or not. The 18 bp deletion of six amino acids, Ser-Asp-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu (798*803), which was located in the CKII phosphorylation site of treacle, seemed relatively benign for TCS. By contrast, another novel mutation of c.1072_1073insC (p.Gln358ProfsX23) was a frameshift mutation and expected to result in a premature stop codon. This study provides insights into the functional domain of treacle and illustrates the importance of clinical and family TCS screening for the interpretation of novel sequence alterations.\n\nNovel nonsense mutation in the katA gene of a catalase-negative Staphylococcus aureus strain.\n\nPubMed\n\nLagos, Jaime; AlarcÃ³n, Pedro; Benadof, Dona; Ulloa, Soledad; Fasce, Rodrigo; Tognarelli, Javier; Aguayo, Carolina; Araya, Pamela; Parra, BÃ¡rbara; Olivares, Berta; HormazÃ¡bal, Juan Carlos; FernÃ¡ndez, Jorge\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe report the first description of a rare catalase-negative strain of Staphylococcus aureus in Chile. This new variant was isolated from blood and synovial tissue samples of a pediatric patient. Sequencing analysis revealed that this catalase-negative strain is related to ST10 strain, which has earlier been described in relation to S. aureus carriers. Interestingly, sequence analysis of the catalase gene katA revealed presence of a novel nonsense mutation that causes premature translational truncation of the C-terminus of the enzyme leading to a loss of 222 amino acids. Our study suggests that loss of catalase activity in this rare catalase-negative Chilean strain is due to this novel nonsense mutation in the katA gene, which truncates the enzyme to just 283 amino acids.

Further to establish population genetics of FLG mutations in the Japanese population and to elucidate effects of FLG mutations to filaggrin biosynthesis in skin of patients with AE. We searched for FLG mutations in 19 newly recruited Japanese patients with AE. We then screened 137 Japanese patients with AE and 134 Japanese control individuals for a novel mutation identified in the present study. In addition, we evaluated FLG mRNA expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and profilaggrin/filaggrin protein expression by immunohistochemical staining in the epidermis of the patients carrying the novel mutation. We identified a novel FLG nonsense mutation c.12069A>T (p.Lys4021X) in one patient with AE. Upon further screening, p.Lys4021X was identified in four patients with AE (2.9% of all the patients with AE). In total, there are at least eight FLG variants in the Japanese population. Here we show that about 27% of patients in our Japanese AE case series carry one or more of these eight FLG mutations and these variants are also carried by 3.7% of Japanese general control individuals. There is a significant statistical association between the eight FLG mutations and AE (chi(2) P = 6.50 x 10(-8)). Interestingly, the present nonsense mutation is in the C-terminal incomplete filaggrin repeat and is the mutation nearest the C-terminal among previously reported FLG mutations. Immunohistochemical staining for filaggrin revealed that this nonsense mutation leads to remarkable reduction of filaggrin protein expression in the patients' epidermis. We clearly demonstrated that FLG mutations are significantly associated with AE in the Japanese population. The present results further support the hypothesis that the C-terminal region is essential for proper processing of profilaggrin to filaggrin.\n\nA novel nonsense mutation in the NDP gene in a Chinese family with Norrie disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Deyuan; Hu, Zhengmao; Peng, Yu; Yu, Changhong; Liu, Yalan; Mo, Xiaoyun; Li, Xiaoping; Lu, Lina; Xu, Xiaojuan; Su, Wei; Pan, Qian; Xia, Kun\n\n2010-12-08\n\nNorrie disease (ND), a rare X-linked recessive disorder, is characterized by congenital blindness and, occasionally, mental retardation and hearing loss.

It is the most common type of syndromic hearing impairment with highly genetic heterogeneity and proved to be related by 6 genes as follows: PAX3, MITF, SNAI2, EDN3, EDNRB and SOX10. This article aims to identify the genetic causes of a Chinese WS child patient. A Chinese WS child was collected for clinical data collection by questionnaire survey. DNA samples of proband and his parents were extracted from peripheral blood samples. Six candidate genes were sequenced by the Trusight One sequencing panel on the illumina NextSeq 500 platform. A novel nonsense heterozygous mutation was found in the coding region of exon 2 in the SOX10 gene of proband. The novel nonsense heterozygous mutation could cause the replacement of the 55th lysine codon by stop codon (484Tâ>âC, C142R) and further more possibly cause terminating the protein translation in advance. However, both proband's parents had no mutation of genes above mentioned. The gene mutation of SOX10 [NM_006941.3âc.163Aâ>âT] is a novel nonsense mutation. No record of this mutation has been found in dbSNP, HGMD, 1000 Genomes Project, ClinVar and ESP6500 databases. It meets the condition of PS2 of strong evidence in 2015 ACMG Standards and Guidelines.

This therapeutic approach utilizes pharmacological agents that suppress translation termination at in-frame premature termination codons (PTCs) to restore translation of a full-length, functional polypeptide. The efficiency of various classes of compounds to suppress PTCs in mammalian cells is discussed along with the current limitations of this therapy. We also elaborate on approaches to improve the efficiency of suppression that include methods to enhance the effectiveness of current suppression drugs and the design or discovery of new, more effective suppression agents. Finally, we discuss the role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in limiting the effectiveness of suppression therapy, and describe tactics that may allow the efficiency of NMD to be modulated in order to enhance suppression therapy.

Twenty-two families showed mutations in the coding region of the connexin32 (cx32) gene. The mutations include four nonsense mutations, eight missense mutations, two medium size deletions, and one insertion. Most missense mutations showed a mild clinical phenotype (five out of eight), whereas all nonsense mutations, the larger of the two deletions, and the insertion that produced frameshifts showed severe phenotypes. Five CMTX1 families with mild clinical phenotype showed no point mutations of the cx32 gene coding region. Three of these familiesmoreÂ Â» showed positive genetic linkage with the markers of the Xq13.1 region. The genetic linkage of the remaining two families could not be evaluated because of their small size. 25 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nCXCR4 WHIM-like frameshift and nonsense mutations promote ibrutinib resistance but do not supplant MYD88(L265P) -directed survival signalling in WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinaemia cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Yang; Hunter, Zachary R; Liu, Xia; Xu, Lian; Yang, Guang; Chen, Jie; Tsakmaklis, Nickolas; Kanan, Sandra; Castillo, Jorge J; Treon, Steven P\n\n2015-03-01\n\nCXCR4(WHIM) frameshift and nonsense mutations follow MYD88(L265P) as the most common somatic variants in WaldenstrÃ¶m Macroglobulinaemia (WM), and impact clinical presentation and ibrutinib response. While the nonsense (CXCR4(S338X) ) mutation has been investigated, little is known about CXCR4 frameshift (CXCR4(FS) ) mutations. We engineered WM cells to express CXCR4(FS) mutations present in patients, and compared their CXCL12 (SDF-1a) induced signalling and ibrutinib sensitivity to CXCR4(wild-type (WT)) and CXCR4(S338X) cells. Following CXCL12 stimulation, CXCR4(FS) and CXCR4(S338X) WM cells showed impaired CXCR4 receptor internalization, and enhanced AKT1 (also termed AKT) and MAPK1 (also termed ERK) activation versus CXCR(WT) cells (P < 0Â·05), though MAPK1 activation was more prolonged in CXCR4(S338X) cells (P < 0Â·05). CXCR4(FS) and CXCR4(S338X) cells, but not CXCR4(WT) cells, were rescued from ibrutinib-triggered apoptosis by CXCL12 that was reversed by AKT1, MAPK1 or CXCR4 antagonists. Treatment with an inhibitor that blocks MYD88(L265P) signalling triggered similar levels of apoptosis that was not abrogated by CXCL12 treatment in CXCR4(WT) and CXCR4(WHIM) cells. These studies show a functional role for CXCR4(FS) mutations in WM, and provide a framework for the investigation of CXCR4 antagonists with ibrutinib in CXCR4(WHIM) -mutated WM patients. Direct inhibition of MYD88(L265P) signalling overcomes CXCL12 triggered survival effects in CXCR4(WHIM) -mutated cells supporting a primary role for this survival pathway in WM.

We report a multiplex nonconsanguineous family of Ashkenazi-Jewish descent, in which the index patient presented with a persistent scalp skin lesion, dystrophic nails and light thin hair. Further evaluation revealed over 10 affected individuals in the kindred, over four generations, exhibiting varying degrees of ectodermal involvement. Analysis of the TP63 gene from four of the patients and from two healthy individuals of the same family was performed. Gene sequencing of the patients revealed a nonsense mutation leading to a premature termination codon (PTC) (p.Gln16X). The same mutation was found in all tested affected individuals in the family, but gave rise to marked phenotypic variability with minor clinical manifestations in some individuals, underscoring the clinical heterogeneity associated with the recently described PTC-causing mutations.\n\nLimited phenotypic variation of hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta in a Danish five-generation family with a novel FAM83H nonsense mutation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaubek, Dorte; GjÃ¸rup, Hans; Jensen, Lillian G; Juncker, Inger; Nyegaard, Mette; BÃ¸rglum, Anders D; Poulsen, Sven; Hertz, Jens M\n\n2011-11-01\n\nBACKGROUND.â Autosomal dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta (ADHCAI) is a disease with severe dental manifestations. OBJECTIVES.â The aims were by means of a genome-wide linkage scan to search for the gene underlying the ADHCAI phenotype in a Danish five-generation family and to study the phenotypic variation of the enamel in affected family members. RESULTS.â Significant linkage was found to a locus at chromosome 8q24.3 comprising the gene FAM83H identified to be responsible for ADHCAI in other families. Subsequent sequencing of FAM83H in affected family members revealed a novel nonsense mutation, p.Y302X. Limited phenotypic variation was found among affected family members with loss of translucency and discoloration of the enamel. Extensive posteruptive loss of enamel was found in all teeth of affected subjects. The tip of the cusps on the premolars and molars and a zone along the gingival margin seemed resistant to posteruptive loss of enamel. We have screened FAM83H in another five unrelated Danish patients with a phenotype of ADHCAI similar to that in the five-generation family, and identified a de novo FAM83H nonsense mutation, p.Q452X in one of these patients. CONCLUSION.â We have identified a FAM83H mutation in two of six unrelated families with ADHCAI and found limited phenotypic variation of the enamel in these patients. Â© 2011 The Authors.

In this report, we described a novel nonsense mutation of GHR. The patient was evaluated at the age of 6 yr, for short stature associated to clinical phenotype of GHI. GH, IGF-1, and GHBP levels were determined. The PCR products from exons 2-10 were sequenced. The patient had high GH (26 microg/L), low IGF-1 (22.5 ng/ml) and undetectable GHBP levels. The sequencing of GHR exon 5 disclosed adenine duplication at nucleotide 338 of GHR coding sequence (c.338dupA) in homozygous state. We described a novel mutation that causes a truncated GHR and a loss of receptor function due to the lack of amino acids comprising the transmembrane and intracellular regions of GHR protein, leading to GHI.\n\nMutational Survey of the PHEX Gene in Patients with X-linked Hypophosphatemic Rickets\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIchikawa, Shoji; Traxler, Elizabeth A.; Estwick, Selina A.; Curry, "
