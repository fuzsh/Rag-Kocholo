        "text": "Iqbal \"Ike\" K. Ahmed, MD, FRCSC, is a fellowship-trained glaucoma, cataract, and anterior segment surgeon with clinical and research focuses on managing glaucoma, complex cataracts, and intraocular lens complications.\n\nDr. Ahmed is recognized worldwide as one of the most experienced surgeons for complex eye conditions and renowned for his groundbreaking work in the surgical treatment of diseases, including glaucoma and surgical complications. He has an international patient base and has been invited to perform surgery on four continents. In 2020, The Ophthalmologist magazine Power List named Dr. Ahmed the second most influential ophthalmologist worldwide.\n\nHe has done pioneering work in innovative glaucoma therapeutics and coined the term “Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS)” as a new genre of surgical approaches and devices. Microscopic MIGS devices are implanted into the eye to reduce the high intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. Dr. Ahmed has also designed innovative diamond scalpels for surgery, microsurgical instrumentation, and other devices, implants, and techniques to manage dislocated cataracts, iris reconstruction, and glaucoma.\n\nIn addition to his clinical practice at the Moran Eye Center, Dr. Ahmed serves as Director of its Alan S. Crandall Center for Glaucoma Innovation. The center conducts research to understand glaucoma’s impact on vision and the genetics of the disease. It is developing new diagnostic tools and designing safer and more effective treatments that will increase access to care. Thanks to his innovative expertise, Dr. Ahmed consults for more than 50 companies and manufacturers and sits on numerous scientific advisory boards.\n\nDr. Ahmed has been the principal investigator for numerous research studies and served as a medical monitor for many pivotal clinical trials. He has published more than 170 peer-reviewed papers and several books on glaucoma, intraocular lenses, and advanced anterior segment surgeries. Dr. Ahmed has made over 1,000 scientific presentations, including 40 visiting professor's lectures around the world. He sits on the editorial boards of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmology-Glaucoma, Journal of Glaucoma, Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology, EyeNet, Ocular Surgery News, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Today, and is a reviewer for numerous journals. In 2018, Glaucoma Today appointed him as Chief Medical Editor.\n\nDr. Ahmed has received numerous awards, including the prestigious American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery's Binkhorst medal, awarded to the world's most prominent ophthalmologists. The American Glaucoma Society honored him with the AGS Surgery Day Lecture, and the United Kingdom & Ireland Society of Cataract & Refractive Surgeons bestowed him with the Pearce Medal Lecture in 2015. Most recently, he was named recipient of the Charles Kelman Medal, to be presented at the Brazilian Association of Cataract and Refractive Surgery 2022 international congress in May 2022.\n\nDr. Ahmed splits his time between his practices in Canada and the Moran Eye Center.\n\nTo make an appointment:\n\n-For physicians, fax to refer a patient to Dr. Ahmed at 801-213-6972.\n\n-For patients, a referral is required to make an appointment with Dr. Ahmed. Fax the referral to 801-213-6972.\n\nLearn more about the Alan S. Crandall Center for Glaucoma Innovation.\n\nIqbal \"Ike\" K.
