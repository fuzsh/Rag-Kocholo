        "text": "Masood Ahmed is Associate Professor of Law at the University of Leicester. He read law at the University of Cambridge (Sidney Sussex College) and completed his postgraduate diploma in legal practice at Cardiff University. He qualified as a solicitor at a leading international commercial law firm and practised commercial dispute resolution (litigation, arbitration and mediation) as well as undertaking commercial transactional work.\n\nHe is the Alternative Dispute Resolution and Case Note Editor of the Civil Justice Quarterly, an editor of the Journal of Personal Injury Law and a commentator of the White Book (the leading text on the English Civil Procedure Rules).\n\nMasood has been involved in various major civil justice reform projects in England and Wales. He served two terms (6 years) as a member of the Civil Procedure Rule Committee (CPRC) and was involved in the implementation of a number of reforms including the Online Civil Money Claims (OCMC) system, reforms to the court rules on open justice and the Media & Communications Pre-action Protocol, and enhancing the role of ADR within the civil court process. He has also advised His Majesty’s Courts & Tribunal Service (HMCTS), the Ministry of Justice and the Law Society of England and Wales. Masood was appointed to review and evaluate a novel ADR procedure – the Professional Negligence Adjudication Scheme – and worked with senior judges (Mrs Justice Carr (now Lady Chief Justice Carr) and Mr Justice Fraser (now Lord Justice Fraser)) and leading practitioners. Following the publication of his recommendations, the Adjudication Scheme was successfully implemented.\n\nMasood is currently a member of Civil Justice Council (CJC)'s Pre-action Protocol Main Working Party which is advising the Master of the Rolls on the future role and reform of the protocols. He is also a member of the Law Society’s Dispute Resolution Committee and has advised the Law Society on various aspects of its 21st Century Justice Project.\n\nHe is a Research Fellow on the ‘Affordable Access to Justice’ project at the Erasmus University (Netherlands) and one of the lead researchers on the European Law Institute (ELI) project ‘Ditigitalisation of the Civil Courts.’\n\nBooks\n\n(with A.
