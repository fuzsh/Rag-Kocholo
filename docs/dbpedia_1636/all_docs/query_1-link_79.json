        "text": "BBC news star Karin Giannone finally got legally hitched to news director Nick Buckley over the weekend. The 50-year-old news broadcaster shared a glimpse of her big day with fans across social media.\n\nTaking to Instagram the newsreader uploaded a snap of them tying the knot. Looking radiant the blonde beauty stood in a floor-length lace fitted column dress which boasted a unique pattern across her chest and shoulders.\n\nBeaming from ear to ear she teamed the stylish look with a glam up do, accessorised with a statement bangle and bracelet. Nick stood next to her and donned a navy blue three-piece suit.\n\nThe duo looked radiant as they smiled gleefully at the wedding officiator, with Karin touching her chest as she appeared to laugh. Proudly writing to her 5,000 followers she claimed that it was one of the “loveliest” moments of her life.\n\nShe said: “Our Wedding blessing, One of the loveliest days of my life”. Fans leapt to the comments section and sent their good wishes with one person writing “Aw congratulations.”\n\nAnother person penned: “Wonderful. You look stunning. Many congratulations to you both.” Another agreed and said: “Congratulations and you look incredible.”\n\nMeanwhile, Karin also took to X, formerly known as Twitter, where the former Sky News personality posted the same image.\n\nShe simply penned in the caption: \"Properly married now,\" along with a simple heart emoji.\n\nThe pair originally started dating in 2019 after meeting at the British Broadcasting Corporation and travelled to the states.\n\nFour years later back in 2022, they decided to get hitched while they were on their travels in America and decided to tie the knot in California.\n\nAlthough it has been claimed their first wedding ceremony was not legally recognised in the UK, her other half confirmed this is not the case.\n\nTaking to X, Nick wrote: \"Married for 2 years already (newspapers: it’s totally legal to get married in California and for it to be recognised here) but we always wanted to have a UK celebration. Best day ever. Best wife ever. @KarinBBC.\""
