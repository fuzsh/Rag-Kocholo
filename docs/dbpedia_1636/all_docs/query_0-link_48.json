        "text": "Ask the Expert: Is Homemade Sunscreen Safe?\n\nWhen it comes to DIY sunscreens, you don’t know what you’re getting. Formulations that are being shared on social media have no science behind them, and can be dangerous to use. Sunscreens made in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA, and must undergo rigorous testing.\n\nGet in the Swing of It: Golfers on Sun Protection\n\nWhen it comes to skin cancer prevention, consistency is key. And if you have an outdoor hobby, like golf, not using your sunscreen every time you hit the course is a real handicap. Here, our experts drive home advice from their golfing patients that is sure to inspire others.\n\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer and the most frequently occurring form of all cancers. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 3.6 million cases are diagnosed each year. BCCs arise from abnormal, uncontrolled growth of basal cells.\n\nBecause BCCs grow slowly, most are curable and cause minimal damage when caught and treated early. Understanding BCC causes, risk factors and warning signs can help you detect them early, when they are easiest to treat and cure.\n\nOne of three main types of cells in the top layer of the skin, basal cells shed as new ones form. BCC most often occurs when DNA damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or indoor tanning triggers changes in basal cells in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis), resulting in uncontrolled growth.\n\nBCCs can look like open sores, red patches, pink growths, shiny bumps, scars or growths with slightly elevated, rolled edges and/or a central indentation. At times, BCCs may ooze, crust, itch or bleed. The lesions commonly arise in sun-exposed areas of the body. In patients with darker skin, about half of BCCs are pigmented (meaning brown in color).\n\nIt’s important to note that BCCs can look quite different from one person to another. Visit our BCC Warning Signs page for more images and information on BCC signs, symptoms and early detection strategies.\n\nPlease note: Since not all BCCs have the same appearance, these photos serve as a general reference to what they can look like. If you see something new, changing or unusual on your skin, schedule an appointment with your dermatologist.\n\nBCCs rarely spread beyond the original tumor site. But these lesions can grow and become disfiguring and dangerous. Untreated BCCs can become locally invasive, grow wide and deep into the skin and destroy skin, tissue and bone. The longer you wait to get treatment, the more likely it is that the BCC will recur, sometimes repeatedly.\n\nThere are some highly unusual, aggressive cases when BCC spreads to other parts of the body. In even rarer instances, this type of BCC can become life-threatening."
