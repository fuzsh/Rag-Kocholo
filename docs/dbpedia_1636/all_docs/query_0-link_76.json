It may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing. The pain or discomfort may spread to one or both of your arms, or may spread to your neck, jaw, back or stomach\n\nshortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without chest discomfort\n\nfeeling dizzy, light-headed or faint\n\nfeeling sick, indigestion, being sick\n\nsweating or a cold sweat\n\na sudden feeling of anxiety that can feel like a panic attack\n\na lot of coughing or wheezing.\n\nYou may experience just one or a combination of these symptoms.\n\nRead more about the myth of ‘female’ heart attack symptoms.\n\nWhat should I do if I think I'm having a heart attack?\n\nIt’s important that you know the warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack and get medical help immediately. Don’t worry about wasting paramedics’ time, a heart attack is a medical emergency and early treatment is vital.\n\nYou should:\n\ncall 999 for an ambulance\n\nsit down and stay calm\n\nchew 300mg aspirin if you have it and you're not allergic\n\nwait for the ambulance.\n\nWomen may be less likely to get medical help and treatment quickly, despite the warning signs. Early treatment is essential to limit the amount of damage to the heart. A heart attack happens when there is a sudden loss of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle.\n\nLearn more about heart attack.\n\nWomen and heart attack stories\n\nIn our podcast series, The Ticker Tapes, journalist Lucy Mangan talks to three women about what it's like to have a heart attack. From mental health to marriage, and sex to spirituality, there is no stone left unturned in these frank, funny and emotional conversations. Listen on Spotify or Apple music.\n\nDo as many women have heart attacks as men?\n\nIn the UK women have roughly half the number of heart attacks as men, but it is still a major health problem for women.\n\nCoronary heart disease, the main cause of heart attacks, kills more than twice as many women as breast cancer in the UK every year, and it was the single biggest killer of women worldwide in 2019. Despite this, it’s often considered a man’s disease. There are more than 800,000 women in the UK living with coronary heart disease. It’s estimated that around half of them have survived a heart attack.\n\nEach year more than 30,000 women are admitted to hospital in the UK due to a heart attack. Research suggests that survival rates are lower for women than for men.\n\nRead more about how the heart attack gender gap costs women’s lives.\n\nHow to reduce the risk of having a heart attack\n\nKnowing the things that put you at risk of heart attack and taking action can lower the risk of heart attack. Your risk of a heart attack is increased by:\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nhigh cholesterol\n\ndiabetes\n\nsmoking\n\nbeing overweight\n\nnot doing enough physical activity.\n\nFurther risk factors that affect women include:\n\nmenopause\n\npre-eclampsia\n\ngestational diabetes.\n\nThe more risk factors you have, the higher your overall risk. As a woman, your hormones might give you some protection from developing coronary heart disease in your pre-menopause years. But after menopause, your risk rises and continues to rise as you get older.\n\nThere is a lot you can do to reduce your risk factors, such as stopping smoking, getting active and losing weight.\n\nGet tips and advice on healthy living.\n\nWe recommend that all women over the age of 40 visit their local GP or nurse for an NHS Health Check to check their cardiovascular risk. This will include having your blood pressure, blood cholesterol and blood sugar tested. If you're aged 40–74 and living in England, you can ask for an NHS Health Check. If you live in other parts of the UK you may be able to get a similar check.\n\nYour doctor should invite you to review your risk every five years, but you can also just make an appointment yourself to check your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Knowing these numbers and taking action if needed can reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory problems.\n\nIf you have a family history of heart or circulatory disease, make sure you tell your doctor or nurse. You're considered to have a family history of heart or circulatory disease if:"
