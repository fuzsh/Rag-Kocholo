Despite the potential financial loss, we chose to redo the entire site in just one week. Why? Because delivering exceptional value to our clients is paramount. 📊 Product-Driven Approach: - Quality First: Focus is on creating outstanding products that define the brand. - Long-Term Success: Historically, companies like Apple have succeeded by prioritizing product innovation, even when it meant short-term challenges. 📈 Business-Driven Approach: - Market Flexibility: Emphasizes adapting quickly to market demands and profit maximization. - Immediate Results: Often yields quicker financial gains but may sacrifice product quality. ⚠️ Learning from Giants: - Apple: Initially soared with groundbreaking products but faced criticism when it seemed to prioritize business over innovation. - Boeing: Struggled significantly after shifting focus from engineering excellence to cost-cutting and profitability, impacting its reputation and safety records. 👀 What We Learn: History tells if you are business-driven it's a perfect recipe for failure, so you have to strike the right balance. A product-driven ethos fosters innovation and customer loyalty, while a business-driven focus enhances adaptability and market responsiveness. What is the way you believe in tell me in the comments section 🙌🏻 #ProductDriven #BusinessDriven #Entrepreneurship #CustomerSatisfaction\n\nDo you ever wish you had the power to see the future? 🔮 Having a scalable business gives you that power. Why? Because when your business is scalable, it has the flexibility and adaptability to respond to future possibilities that you can't see today, but you very much expect to happen. Case and point, Liz Cullen Whitehead and her \"follow up like a machine\" subscription service, TouchPoint. ------- Two years ago, Liz came to me with a bold idea. After seeing her clients struggle to consistently follow up with their prospects, she thought \"I can coach people to do it, but to make it even easier – why not build a follow up machine?\" And so we did. TouchPoint delivers timely and relevant updates to business owners about their specific prospects so that they have an easy reason to reach out at the exact right time. I helped Liz vet the business case, formulate the subscription model, and develop the technology that powers it. Pretty cool, huh? But here's what's even cooler. Two years later, Liz called me up with a brand new idea for how TouchPoint could serve an entirely new audience. \"Can we do it?\" she asked. \"Absolutely,\" I responded without hesitation. That creative confidence was possible because we didn't build TouchPoint to only fit the version that Liz had originally dreamed up. Instead, we created it with scalability in mind, expecting things to iterate and change over time. That's exactly what happened, and now Liz is well positioned to introduce her offering to a brand new market with hardly any changes to the technology needed. That's the power of scalability, and that's why I approach every project I take with scalability in mind. ------- But I want to know from you, how do you factor in scalability when you implement new ideas? Have you ever wanted to introduce an offering to a new market? Did it go smoothly, or did it require an overhaul to the way you do things?

They don't require some big budget or large team, but they can have a massive impact. Here are 3 ways you can start implementing them today: 1. Customer Feedback Loop: Regularly ask your customers for feedback and act on it. That loop keeps your content and products relevant and fresh. Set up post-purchase surveys to automate data that will be helpful. 2. Daily Learning Habit: Dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to learning something new related to your industry. If you do this, you'll stay ahead of trends and spot ideas faster than your competition. Use custom newsletters like MorningBrew to have relevant news delivered every morning. 3. Small Scale Experiments: Try new marketing strategies or product features on a small scale before you fully commit. You'll minimize risk while maximizing innovation. Ship, analyze, iterate, repeat. These may not seem big at first, but these tiny gains, done well over a long period of time, make a significant difference. #businessboost #entrepreneurship #businesshacks\n\nPricing is like a living organism. 🌿 It grows, adapts, and evolves with the ecosystem that is the market. To ignore its dynamic nature is to risk the health of your business. At Common Ninja, we've just released a new pricing strategy sculpted from the valuable feedback of over 100 customers and insights from top industry leaders. 🔍 Reflect on this: when was the last time you revisited your pricing? If it's been over a quarter, it may be time to take another look. Pricing isn't a set-it-and-forget-it element of your business. It's an integral part of your product that speaks to its value, quality, and relevance to your customers. Embracing this mindset has led us to not only refine our pricing but also to refine our understanding of the value we bring to our customers. It has been a transformative experience, and we want to share the benefits of this approach with you. If you're curious about how our new pricing can benefit your business or want to exchange thoughts on best pricing practices, my inbox is always open 🙂 #Entrepreneurship #PricingStrategy #BusinessGrowth #SaaS #Innovation #CommonNinja #ValueCreation #Widgets #WebsiteBuiling\n\n🛍️ Exploring the Dynamics of Subscription-Based Models in Retail and Service 🛍️ Hey LinkedIn fam! 👋 It's Chris, your go-to small business coach and fellow entrepreneur.

But what does it really mean, and how can you get there? 🔍 Product-Market Fit is the stage where your product resonates with users, both buyers and users, allowing your business to flourish and become profitable. In simple terms, it's when you're selling something people can't resist buying. 🎯 So, how can you be sure you've reached this pivotal point? At the early stages, qualitative metrics hold more weight than quantitative ones. It's not just about growing your customer base; it's about retaining them and making them your brand's enthusiasts. 🧐 One of the first indicators of success is people's willingness to pay for your product. It's not enough to attract visitors; they must open their wallets. And qualitative feedback is key – interviews, surveys, or direct communication. 📈 Signs of Product-Market Fit include shorter sales cycles, low churn rates, high conversion rates, and optimal user #retention. While it's not always easy to measure, a great suggestion from Sean Ellis is to ask your users how disappointed they would be if they couldn't use your product anymore. If over 40% would be \"very disappointed,\" you're likely there. 🚀 Remember, in the world of SaaS, this process can be gradual. Explosive growth isn't always the proof of Product-Market Fit. Some successful entrepreneurs took time to build a solid business, focusing on acquiring new customers, high retention, and positive feedback. 📖 Ready to dive deeper into achieving Product-Market Fit?

It may sound unconventional, when things are running smoothly, it's easy to get comfortable into a false sense of having it all figured out and then relax. But if you have vocal, dissatisfied customers, When a customer expresses their dissatisfaction, it's an opportunity to listen, learn, and adapt. That provides the spark to keep iterating and innovating relentlessly. Think about it: Instead of brushing off complaints, ask yourself \"What persistent frustration are they voicing that we've missed?\" Instead of defensiveness, get curious about \"What unmet need could we be solving in a radically better way?\" Those critical voices push you to keep raising the bar, rather than resting on what you have. Staying obsessed with dissatisfied customers does three things: → It keeps you hungrier than your competitors who may grow complacent with success → It forces you to see your products/services through a beginner's mind → It helps you get ahead of trends and continuously elevate your offerings As Jeff Bezos puts forward this core idea here, \"Focus obsessively on the customer, not the competition.\" If you're always striving to delight those who aren't satisfied, you'll never stop inventing on behalf of the people who matter most. What's one way you've turned dissatisfied customers into a driving force for innovation? #CustomerSatisfaction #Entrepreneurship #FounderPerspective"
