That completely dismisses the idea it's just in your head.\n\n\"It isn't just a case of buying a Viagra and it'll be fine, that deals with the symptom and not the cause.\n\n\"Men need to think of their penis like a barometer of your health and if it's not working, you need to see a doctor and say I've got a medical problem.\"\n\nDr Foster runs a specialist sexual dysfunction clinic in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and, on average, his 1,000 erectile dysfunction patients took three years to see him.\n\n\"Erectile dysfunction and issues around sexual function in men are an enormously stigmatised in the UK,\" added Dr Foster, a member of the British Society of Sexual Medicine.\n\n\"If you had most medical conditions, you probably wouldn't wait three years before you go to see a doctor. If you leave it, relationships suffer and the risk of underlying more serious medical conditions gets worse.\"\n\nTV presenter Davina McCall has campaigned to increase awareness of the menopause and its affect on women and now there are calls for an equivalent male champion for erectile dysfunction to help end the stigma.\n\n\"Like what Davina McCall has done for women and the menopause, I can't tell you how much I wish we had a super-famous man to do that for erectile dysfunction and normalise it because it's a very normal condition,\" said andrology specialist Dr Janine David.\n\nDr Foster agrees, adding: \"It'll take a brave bloke to say 'I've got a erectile dysfunction' but it won't take much for one or two others who are gutsy enough to say 'yeah, I've had this problem too' and for attitudes to start to change.\n\n\"This Men Up drama is really good because even if it doesn't change a population's attitude, it will get men thinking - and maybe a couple will go and see their doctor if something is not quite right.\"\n\nFive ordinary Welshmen face up to their secrets and lies when they embark on one of the world's first medical trials for the drug that would become Viagra.\n\nCatch Men Up on BBC iPlayer and on BBC One on Friday at 21:00 GMT.\n\nDr David set up and became medical director of Men's Health Wales to help improve the health of patients in an area she feels is \"often overlooked\".\n\n\"Men with erectile dysfunction and diabetes must have a testosterone blood test to rule out it being low because half will have low testosterone,\" said Dr David, secretary of the British Society for Sexual Medicine.\n\n\"Testosterone deficiency needs to be checked as it can make men feel depressed, which can cause erectile dysfunction which can, in turn, make them more depressed so its a vicious cycle.\n\n\"Erections will not improve without testosterone replacement.\"\n\nIt is hoped the drama can help transform the \"sniggering behind closed doors\" taboo attitude to men who cannot get an erection.\n\n\"Men's mental health and opening up is the heart of Men Up,\" said Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Gangs of London star Mark Lewis Jones, who plays macho Eddie O'Connor in the drama.\n\n\"We've made a bit of progress but we've still a long way to go - and I count myself within that as well as I find it difficult to talk about feelings and identifying them.\n\n\"We hope people take away from it that these men's lives changed as a result of an experience they shared.\"\n\nMen Up is based on a medical trial in Swansea in 1994 for the pill then known as Sildenafil UK-92,480 by pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and included men with diabetes and heart disease, where erectile dysfunction is a common side effect.\n\nAfter the study at Morriston Hospital, Viagra went on to become one of the most controversial, profitable and well-known drugs in history that has been used by millions of men across the world.\n\n\"It uses a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down using the comedy to address the issue. Getting men to laugh is probably a good way into it,\" said the former EastEnders actor.\n\nWhat causes erectile dysfunction?\n\nMost men occasionally fail to get or keep an erection and this is usually caused by stress, tiredness, drinking too much alcohol or a side effect of some medicine - and is nothing to worry about.\n\nIf erectile dysfunction happens often, it may be caused by a condition such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, diabetes, depression or anxiety or hormone problems.\n\nHealthy lifestyle changes, losing weight if you're overweight, eating a healthy diet, exercising daily, stopping smoking and reducing stress can sometimes help with erectile dysfunction."
