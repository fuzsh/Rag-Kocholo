        "text": "“Military service? It set me up for life!” says Johnny Ball. “People today imagine it was brutal but, honestly, I found the culture in TV to be far more cut-throat. My memories of the military are full of joy and camaraderie. I think some time in the military would really help kids today who are drifting, disconnected, feeling they might be cleverer and capable of more than their school results suggest.”\n\nAt 85, the former children’s television presenter (and father of Radio 2 DJ Zoe Ball) is as electrified by his enthusiasms as ever. I grew up in the 1980s, watching him turn maths into magic tricks on Think of a Number, which ran from 1977-84. I remember him pulling sum solutions, like rabbits, from hats, and slipping the secrets of the universe from his sleeve. So much more fun than school. Few others could so vividly connect the numbers to the way the physical world worked.\n\nToday I’m getting a show for one, sitting as I am in the cosy lounge of his Buckinghamshire home as he shuffles a deck of black and white photos of his “happy, happy days” in the RAF from 1957 to 1960. He’s continuing his mission to encourage current and former service personnel to reach out to the RAF Benevolent Fund if they need assistance, and is warm, lively company.\n\nDressed in a smart shirt and jumper and in apologetic form – he realises he’s been too busy to shave before my arrival; “Sorry! Am I bristly?” – he declares he’s “so happy to be involved with the charity because it’s so important”. As a radar operator he was stationed, at one point, on the border between East and West Berlin.\n\nHe passes over a crumpled picture of a cluster of boys, larking about in a German bar: “Here we are drinking from a glass boot!” he chuckles. “Six or seven pints in that, there was. We drank it in teams and we could all down a pint in 30 seconds… there’s me,” he points at his 19-year-old self. “Just look at the anticipation on my face as I wait my turn!”\n\nBorn in Bristol in 1938, Ball is the son of an iron founder. “[My father] kneeled in sand all his life and ended up with no hair follicles on the skin of his legs,” Ball once explained. “My mother had a job in a boot factory during the war and then in a weaving mill.” His father taught him maths from an early age and his mother gave him a love of precision – the boots she stitched for soldiers out in the swamps of Burma had to be watertight. The only books in the house were a set of encyclopaedias.\n\nThe family moved to Bolton in the hope of a new start – running a greengrocer’s shop – when Johnny was 11 years old. But he slipped from top sets to bottom ones as the greengrocer’s floundered and failed, and his mother had to go back to work in the mills. “School was awful, a farce, a tragedy,” he says. “I ended up with just two O-levels, not good enough to get into sixth form let alone university.”\n\nLuckily, Ball fell on his feet when he sought work at the local de Havilland aircraft factory. “Applicants had to sit a half-hour maths test and a half-hour English one – I got 100% on both!” While working at de Havilland he got three more O-levels under his own steam and the company sent him on a business course to qualify as an accountant.\n\nIt was a role in which he’d have to price up propellers for RAF transporters that he’d later get to fly, but he shuddered at the idea of “being an industrial accountant, for the rest of my life?? I don’t think so! I was told I could defer my National Service until I was 25 but I was more than ready to get out and go!”\n\nFor the first time in his life, Ball admits, he was nervous. “I had so many sleepless nights, worrying I’d fail the medical,” he says. “There was nothing wrong with me. Nothing, but that big: what if…? Horrors!”\n\nHe recalls the awkwardness of being forced to stand in a room with 20 other young men when the time came. “All of us nude!” When he was passed A1, Ball was told he’d be sent to the Lancashire Fusiliers and resisted. “I told them ‘No. I’m joining the RAF!’\n\n“I volunteered for the radar operator, it was the shortest training and maximum chance of overseas posting… They sent me to Wales, though!”\n\nAt reunions decades later, Ball and his pals would realise that all the most academically successful recruits were also sent to Wales – “to learn the best from the boffins!” – then out to the frontline of the Cold War where, he tells me, “we got really good at identifying all the aircraft on the radar screen. Certain aircraft gave a different signal. You could tell what was what by the height and the speed.” I ask if he was ever frightened and he laughs. “Never! We played games with the Soviets!\n\n“At 3am the battle cry would go up. Our boys would fly off and head for Berlin. We’d start the watches and wait for the first MIG to go up – pinng!! The next night they’d do the same to us.”\n\nThe only time Ball encountered people who’d faced a genuine threat was when he helped East Germans who’d “risked being shot to come through the wire”. He was humbled helping those poor souls, giving them extra rations pilfered from the canteen. “We gave them tea, sugar and things.”\n\nBut Ball’s need to entertain was bubbling under throughout. He made money running a cafe (“we used German sausages in our sausage rolls”) and wrote the barracks’ Christmas pantomime: Aladdin.\n\n“Looking back I don’t know how I found the confidence. I was only 20 and our CO’s wife played the lead, while I was the genie. I had to appear in the middle of the stage in a flash of light, which meant somersaulting myself into position. But the Eagle Comic had a comic strip which taught jiu-jitsu and it showed you how to hit the ground on your back, slapping down with your forearm, and it damn well worked!”\n\nAlthough Ball loved his time in the RAF, he tells me now that “three years was enough”. He’d always wanted to become a comedian and he went straight from radar to redcoat duties at Butlins. “I took those falling lessons with me too. When they chose the Holiday Princess each week, they’d bring the girl over to give me a kiss and I’d be able to fall flat backwards afterwards!”\n\nBall transferred from Butlins – via a short spell working for a shipping company in Liverpool – to a very successful and lucrative career on the stand-up circuit. “I had about nine days off in my first year,” he tells me. “I was doing so well that on the only night Roy Orbison played a comedy club his management asked for me. Same happened with the Bee Gees.”\n\nHe recalls going to see the late comedian Freddie Starr, live at the Blue Angel in Liverpool in 1962. “It was a speakeasy – unlicensed, but you could get a vodka tonic in a cup. I was there one night, around 2am, when Paul McCartney and George Harrison were there, before they were famous,” he remembers. “He was difficult, Freddie. He didn’t get on with anybody. He was such an oddball. But one of the most talented people I ever met.”\n\nAlthough Ball’s peers were surprised by his transfer to children’s TV, Ball tells me he was happiest educating the nation. He took a job presenting Play School in 1967 but carried on with the comedy. When hecklers asked if he was still doing that show for toddlers he’d reply “Yeah! You still watching it?” Follow-up heckles would be met by Ball threatening to throw disruptors “through the square window”.\n\nIn 1976 Johnny Ball married his second wife, Dianne, a dancer who clearly still dotes on him and with whom he had two sons Nick (a screenwriter) and Daniel (a structural engineer). From the minute I press the couple’s musical doorbell she dances attendance on us, bringing out homemade banana and pecan cake and describing the daily five-minute workout she’s given Johnny to keep in shape.\n\nThe shelves of their lounge are lined with books that she has made from photo collections, and on the windowsill are matching ceramic Di and Johnny gnomes. Their cocker spaniel, Holly, sneaks a piece of cake as the couple tell me that when anything upsets them they cheer themselves up by “skipping like five-year-olds” while walking her.\n\nAs Ball has told me he found the media to be “cut-throat”, I wonder if he worried about Zoe going into the business. But he shakes his head. “Both my boys could have benefitted from national service – even if they didn’t need it – but Zo …” – he always calls her Zo – “was off and running from 18, working up in Manchester.”\n\nAs a strict dad he was firm with his daughter when it came to applying for jobs. “I told her: when you ring them you stand up. You walk around for a few minutes beforehand so you sound alive and bright. You do not take phone calls lying down, slouching mumbling: err, umm, err, I dunno what I want…”\n\nAlthough 18-year-old Zoe initially got a job in Manchester working as a researcher for BSkyB, Ball says his daughter floundered after losing out on another job that was offered to her three flatmates but not to her. “She took it all very hard, being at a low ebb. She told us her car had been stolen but I think she’d had to sell it. She was penniless and I didn’t find out until later.” Ball shakes his head.\n\n“I went up and took her out to an Italian restaurant . [but] she was eyeing up the bloody waiter!” That same night Ball ordered his daughter back to London. “She said: ‘Manchester’s me roots’,” says Ball. “But I said: ‘I’m your bloody roots!’”\n\nAs things turned out, Zoe was soon snapped up by the Big Breakfast in 1996 as a lead presenter on the cult TV show and Ball tells me that the show’s then anchor, Chris Evans, “instantly knew she was a star.”\n\nAs Ball progressed through children’s TV during the reign of predators like Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris was he not worried for his daughter? “I’ve never worried about her,” he says. “Only once, when her group of girls were in the pub and I saw this older guy watching them. I told her I knew this man was a predator and she just laughed. She said they knew all about him and had put him in his place years ago. I never worried after that.”\n\nOf Savile, Ball says: “I knew he was a wrong ‘un from way before television. I knew that from my club days. We all knew to stay away. I was the only children’s TV presenter who was never asked to do a Fix It for Jimmy and I wonder why. I wonder if he knew what I knew…”\n\nJohnny Ball left children’s TV in 1994 and says he’s made double the money working for the private sector making promotional videos for energy providers and other companies.\n\nSince then, he argues: “The BBC destroyed children’s TV by giving it its own channels,” pointing out that when kids shows were on the main channels “viewing figures at 4.30pm were 5-6 million”. Meantime, he claims: “Blue Peter on one occasion last year, recorded NO viewers?”\n\nHis theory is that this is a consequence of “drama taking over with Grange Hill and Byker Grove, which taught kids how to be naughty, which they already learnt for themselves. In our factual days, we were by far the finest children’s TV production unit in the entire world. My shows might stand repeating even today.”\n\nBall won’t be drawn on whether Rishi Sunak is right to push for all kids to learn maths up until the age of 18. He’s never publicly backed any political party and has previously found himself in hot water for arguing against man-made climate change – a topic on which he won’t comment today.\n\nWhat he will say is that: “Rishi Sunak can see that the maths curriculum has been thinned over the years; this leads to boredom as teaching does not move fast enough and is not challenging enough.”\n\nDuring the rainy afternoon we’ve spent together, he’s explained Greek theories of horizon calculation. He’s made the maths of the earth’s curvature accessible and fun. But he believes there’s now “too much emphasis on numeracy in primary school and statistics in secondary school. Both are boring and have little to excite students with.\n\n“Geometry, as the Greeks found, is a far better and clearer way to enthuse people about maths, as it teaches us about the world and its shape, about spatial awareness and how maths also connects to art.”\n\nHe’s so energised, I ask for his secret. “There isn’t one!” he says. “I’m just me!” He shows me the many gazebos he’s designed and built in the garden. But he laments that while he keeps pitching ideas to TV execs “the phone doesn’t ring as often as I’d like. People seem to want simpler and stupider ideas than I do.”\n\nAlthough Ball has framed photographs of his appearances on Strictly Come Dancing – as the show’s oldest ever contestant in 2019 – beside his television, he tells me he had an awful time on the show.\n\nHe loved doing Gogglebox with Zoe and her 23-year-old son Woody at first, though the trio have decided not to do it again after feeling “sold out”. Ball has six grandchildren, including Woody and his young sister, 13-year-old Nelly.\n\nI wonder what kind of grandfather Ball is and he tells me he’s “not a gusher. I don’t send any of them birthday cards. Di does that. I do send the odd email saying hello, but I won’t do WhatsApp.”\n\nHe complains he “doesn’t see enough of the kids” but spent Christmas with some of them in a small village just outside Folkestone. “One of my sons rented a house from the National Trust,” he grins. “The people in that village have a Boxing Day hunt with 60 wonderful hounds, all the horses, 150 demonstrators, 40 police… and a partridge in a pear tree. They put up with the bloody demonstrators every year.”\n\nHis contribution was a punch made from “three litres of Algerian red wine. A bottle of whiskey… bottom shelf. And then a two-litre bottle of lemonade, poured only to the bottom of the label, and a handful of white sugar. It’s wonderful. Although I wouldn’t encourage you to drive far after a glass of it…” He doesn’t do New Year resolutions and is appalled to hear I always do Dry January. “Terrible idea!” he snorts. “What did January ever do to you!?”\n\nBall has recently completed an autobiography and tells me he sent it to Zoe to read. “She loved it. So did her agent. But the publisher says it’s so long, so I need to cut it back… Hard when you’ve had such an interesting life!”\n\nAs Ball lets me out of the front door he tells me he hopes the main message I’ve received is that the military can give new purpose to young boys. “Looking back,” he says, ”what I remember of the RAF is seeing how well young men worked together. Even in bomber command, where the life expectancy was down to days and weeks.” He shrugs.\n\n“All these modern influences? The internet and mobile phones? They don’t matter. When the chips are down, young men will still make the same choices. If that means offering their lives for their country it is what they will do.”\n\nThe RAF Benevolent Fund is one of four charities supported by this year’s Telegraph Christmas Charity Appeal.
