        "text": "In 2003, weapons expert Dr David Kelly was thrust into the media spotlight after being identified in newspapers as the man the government believed was the source for a controversial BBC report on Iraq.\n\nThe scientist was used to talking to journalists behind the scenes but he now became a key figure in the row between the government and the BBC over claims Downing Street had \"sexed up\" a dossier on Iraq's weapons capability.\n\nThe BBC report, in May 2003, cast doubt on the government's claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction capable of being deployed within 45 minutes.\n\nAfter he was named in newspapers, Dr Kelly gave evidence to MPs' committees in which he said he did not believe he was the main source of the story.\n\nTwo days after his testimony, the 59-year-old was found dead in woodland a few miles from his Oxfordshire home after apparently taking his own life.\n\nHis wife Janice later told the inquiry into his death that her husband had been utterly dismayed by the media frenzy around him.\n\nDr Kelly had spent the majority of his career as a consultant to the MoD and other government departments and agencies, advising them on his area of expertise - arms control.\n\nHe had worked as a weapons inspector in Iraq between 1991 and 1998, following the first Gulf War, earning a nomination for a Nobel peace prize.\n\nAfter his death, the BBC confirmed the scientist had been its principal contact for the report claiming the Iraq dossier had been \"sexed up\".\n\nOn the day Dr Kelly's body was discovered, then Prime Minister Tony Blair asked Lord Hutton to conduct an urgent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death.\n\nUnusually, the inquest opened into Dr Kelly's death was never completed.\n\nLord Hutton released his findings in January 2004, reporting that the scientist had committed suicide by slashing his wrist with a blunt gardening knife.\n\nThe report found that a severe loss of self-esteem for Dr Kelly, due to a feeling that people had lost trust in him and his dismay at media exposure, was probably the major factor behind him taking his own life.\n\nLord Hutton requested that the details of the post-mortem examination and toxicology tests be classified for 70 years - to protect the privacy of the Kelly family.\n\nBut, in October last year, the government sought to end continuing speculation over Dr Kelly's death by releasing the reports which backed up Lord Hutton's verdict.\n\nThe evidence released last October included the report by pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt, who had attended the scene where Dr Kelly's body was found in July 2003.\n\nAt the post-mortem examination, he found a series of wounds on Dr Kelly's left wrist which had \"completely severed\" the ulnar artery.\n\nDr Hunt reported: \"The orientation and arrangement of the wounds over the left wrist are typical of self-inflicted injury.\"\n\nHe added: \"There is no positive pathological evidence to indicate that this man has been subjected to a sustained, violent assault prior to his death.\n\n\"There is no evidence from the post-mortem or my observations at the scene to indicate that the deceased had been dragged or otherwise transported to the location at which his body was found.\"\n\nThe time of death was estimated to be between 16:15 BST on 17 July and 01:15 BST on 18 July.\n\nWhile the wrist wounds were found to be the main cause of death, Dr Hunt added that an excessive amount of painkillers Dr Kelly had taken and \"apparently clinically silent coronary artery disease\" would both have played a part in \"bringing about death more certainly and more rapidly than would have otherwise been the case\".\n\nMr Grieve told MPs: \"Having given all the material that's been sent to me the most careful consideration, I've concluded that the evidence that Dr Kelly took his own life is overwhelmingly strong.\n\n\"Further, there is nothing I've seen that supports any allegation that Dr Kelly was murdered or that his death was the subject of any kind of conspiracy or cover-up.\"\n\nThere was no \"evidential basis\" to refer the case to the High Court, he told MPs, adding that it would have been \"dismissed\" by judges \"with what I would assume would be a certain amount of irritation\".\n\nThe attorney general argued that Lord Hutton's inquiry had been \"tantamount to an inquest\".\n\nFollowing the government's decision, the doctors who had petitioned Mr Grieve called for his resignation.\n\nCampaign leader Dr Stephen Frost said: \"The continuing cover-up of the truth of what happened is a national disgrace and should be of concern to all British citizens.\""
