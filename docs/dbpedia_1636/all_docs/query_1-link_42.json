        "text": "\"She is destined to be an utterly iconic Doctor.\"\n\nOn Sunday it was announced that Jodie Whittaker will become the first woman to play the role of the Doctor in Doctor Who, following Peter Capaldi's departure at Christmas.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC following the announcement, Jodie said she was \"beyond excited\" to play the role, calling it \"more than an honour\".\n\nBut of course, because we can't have nice things, there was immediate backlash online from viewers who believe that the Doctor can't possibly be portrayed by a woman, and \"nobody wants a TARDIS full of bras\".\n\nIt is, in fact, HELL.\n\nAnd the complaints have got so bad that the BBC has issued a statement responding to those who have a problem with the casting.\n\n\"The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey and it has been established in the show that Time Lords can switch gender,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"She is destined to be an utterly iconic Doctor.\"\n\nHere is the BBC's statement in full:\n\nSince the first Doctor regenerated back in 1966, the concept of the Doctor as a constantly evolving being has been central to the programme. The continual input of fresh ideas and new voices across the cast and the writing and production teams has been key to the longevity of the series.\n\nThe Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey and it has been established in the show that Time Lords can switch gender.\n\nAs the Controller of BBC Drama has said, Jodie is not just a talented actor but she has a bold and brilliant vision for her Doctor. She aced it in her audition both technically and with the powerful female life force she brings to the role. She is destined to be an utterly iconic Doctor.\n\nWe hope viewers will enjoy what we have in store for the continuation of the story.\n\nShare This Article"
