        "text": "Ofcom has given the green light to the BBC's proposal to cut back on news content during prime time on the BBC Scotland channel.\n\nThe TV watchdog believes that the BBC's strategy will still fulfil its core purpose and adapt to \"the changing needs of audiences in Scotland\". Ofcom is poised to greenlight a scheme to slash peak evening news output on the BBC Scotland channel by half- However the proposal does come with stipulations.\n\nThe regulator said: \"The BBC must be transparent about how it is delivering for audiences in Scotland, and we will hold it to account. We expect the BBC to monitor the impact of the changes it has proposed and be ready to continue to adapt as necessary to meet audience needs.\"\n\nCurrently, BBC Scotland broadcasts the hour-long The Nine at 9pm from Monday to Thursday and The Seven at 7pm for either 30 minutes or an hour on Fridays. Additionally, The Seven is shown for 15 minutes at 7pm on both Saturdays and Sundays every week.\n\nThe BBC has now proposed to Ofcom to substitute the weekday news slots with a more concise, 30-minute programme at 7pm every weekday. This new format aims to be \"more informal and accessible\" than Reporting Scotland, which is aired from 6.30pm to 7pm on BBC One Scotland, and plans to focus on more local content and cover more areas across Scotland.\n\nAccording to recent reports, the BBC is requesting Ofcom to amend the operating licence for the BBC Scotland channel, which currently requires a minimum of 250 hours of news during peak times annually, proposing to reduce it to 125 hours. In the year 2022/23, BBC Scotland aired 278 hours of news in the peak time slot.\n\nBBC Scotland, which showcases programming tailored for Scottish viewers from 7pm to midnight, was launched in February 2019 featuring The Nine as its main daily news programme. It was announced before its launch that the channel would lead to the creation of over 80 new jobs in the news sector.\n\nHowever Ofcom has recognised that viewership to The Nine has gone down every year since 2020, with a three-minute consecutive weekly reach of 156,000 people in 2020/21 to an astonishing 101,000 in 2023. Despite the drop in ratings, the BBC said The Nine \"does hold its own\" against rival programmes from Sky News but \"it has the lowest weekly reach of the BBC’s television news offer in Scotland\"."
