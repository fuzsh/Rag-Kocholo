        "text": "Peter Capaldi has said he would like David Bowie and Keith Richards to guest star on Doctor Who.\n\n\"David Bowie, he would be a very good one,\" he told the audience at a screening of the first two episodes of series nine in Cardiff.\n\nHe added he would also like to see Rolling Stones guitarist Richards stumbling around the Tardis, knocking out a few chords.\"\n\nThe new series starts on 19 September.\n\nThe trailer includes a clip of Capaldi - a new wave and rock and roll fan - playing the electric guitar, a scene the actor said he was \"delighted\" to find in the script.\n\n\"I think I'd sort of half mentioned it in joking, but I was really delighted that these guys went for it as an idea,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a great day when I went to pick the Doctor's guitar. We went to Denmark Street [in London] and went into various vintage guitar shops, looking for Doctor Who's guitar.\n\n\"I first thought it should be like a Stratocaster or a Telecaster, one of those old classic guitars, but they all started to look like I was having a mid-life crisis.\""
