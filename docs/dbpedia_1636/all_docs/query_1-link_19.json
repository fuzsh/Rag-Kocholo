        "text": "Ofcom has given the thumbs up to the BBC's plans to cut down on news content during prime time on the BBC Scotland channel.\n\nThe TV regulator believes the broadcaster's strategy will still meet its core purpose while adapting to \"the changing needs of audiences in Scotland\". The regulator is set to approve a proposal to halve evening news programming on the BBC Scotland channel, but with certain conditions attached.\n\nThe watchdog stated: \"The BBC must be transparent about how it is delivering for audiences in Scotland, and we will hold it to account. We expect the BBC to monitor the impact of the changes it has proposed and be ready to continue to adapt as necessary to meet audience needs.\"\n\nAt present, BBC Scotland airs the hour-long The Nine at 9pm from Monday to Thursday and The Seven at 7pm, which runs for either 30 minutes or an hour on Fridays. On weekends, The Seven is broadcast for 15 minutes at 7pm on both Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nThe BBC has put forward a plan to Ofcom to replace the weekday news slots with a shorter, 30-minute programme at 7pm every weekday. This revamped format is intended to be \"more informal and accessible\" than Reporting Scotland, which is shown from 6.30pm to 7pm on BBC One Scotland, and aims to concentrate on more local stories and cover a wider range of areas across Scotland.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the BBC is seeking Ofcom's approval to alter the operating licence for BBC Scotland. The current licence requires a minimum of 250 hours of peak time news annually, but the BBC proposes to cut this to 125 hours, reports the Daily Record. In the 2022/23 period, BBC Scotland broadcasted 278 hours of news during peak viewing times.\n\nBBC Scotland, which airs programmes specifically designed for Scottish audiences from 7pm to midnight, was launched in February 2019 with The Nine as its flagship daily news show. It was revealed prior to its launch that the channel would create over 80 new jobs in the news industry.\n\nHowever, Ofcom has noted a decline in viewership for The Nine since 2020, with a three-minute consecutive weekly reach dropping from 156,000 people in 2020/21 to a shocking 101,000 in 2023. Despite the fall in ratings, the BBC maintains that The Nine \"does hold its own\" against competing programmes from Sky News, but admits \"it has the lowest weekly reach of the BBC's television news offer in Scotland\"."
