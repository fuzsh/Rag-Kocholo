        "text": "In a paper rolling mill, the thickness of the paper is monitored by how much beta radiationRadiation caused by beta particles (high-energy electrons). A beta particle is an electron ejected from a nucleus when a neutron becomes a proton. is received at the detector.\n\ngamma radiationHigh frequency electromagnetic radiation emitted during radioactive decay. Many centimetres of lead or metres of concrete are needed to absorb it. kills microbes and can be used to sterilize medical instruments and kill the bacteria on fruit and vegetables so they stay fresh longer.\n\nAn isotope of americium which emits alpha particleSubatomic particle comprising two protons and two neutrons (the same as a helium nucleus). is used in smoke alarms. Alpha radiation ioniseTo ionise is to convert an uncharged atom or molecule into a charged particle by adding or removing electrons. the air and this allows a small current to flow between two electrodes. Alpha is weakly penetrating so smoke stops it, the current drops and the alarm goes off.\n\nA tracer is something that shows how an object moves. radioactive tracerA radioisotope used to trace, eg the flow of blood through an organ. are added to liquids to show if they are flowing correctly. They can show the movement of pollution, eg sewage or waste oil from factories. However, they are used mainly in medicine to monitor blood flow.\n\nTechnetium-99m, which is a gamma source with a short half-life of about six hours, is injected into blood. Arterial blockages or internal bleeds cause a build-up of radioactivity that can be easily detected outside the body. The same principle is used in leak detection of underground pipes. A leak will cause a buildup of radioactivityThe emission of particles and waves from an unstable nucleus. The nucleus loses energy and becomes more stable in this process. that can be detected above the ground.\n\nExternally gamma radiation can be beamed at cancer cells to kill them. The gamma source used should have a long half-life to maintain the dose of radioactivity delivered to the tumour. A long half-life also means that the source in the radiotherapy equipment will not need changing regularly.\n\nInternally an alpha source with a short half-life can be injected directly into the tumour. This is called targeted alpha therapy (TAT). Alpha is strongly ionising â so will kill the cancer cells. It is also weakly penetrating so stays within the tumour and doesnât harm the healthy cells outside the tumour.\n\nLiving things, such as plants and animals, absorb carbon-14 daily. When we die, we no longer absorb carbon-14. Carbon-14 can be used to date organic objects up to about 100,000 years old. The isotope decay follows the usual decay curve.\n\nCarbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. If we find a dead plant or bone that has 25 % of the carbon-14 its living version would have had, weâd know that the fossil is 11,460 years old because two half-lives would have passed."
