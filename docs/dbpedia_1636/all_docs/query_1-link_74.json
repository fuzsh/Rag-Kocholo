        "text": "Footage had emerged of Axel Rudakuban who is accused of murdering three children in Southport dressed as Doctor Who in a Children in Need video.\n\nThe clip was promoting Children in Need in 2018, where Rudakuban who was then 11-years-old, is seen emerging from the Tardis wearing a trench coat and tie. Other child actors are also in video for the promo titled 'it's time to do your thing'.\n\nThe 17-year-old suspect encourages viewers to raise money by dressing \"as every Doctor Who ever.\"\n\nA BBC Children in Need spokesperson has since told the Mirror that the charity has no relationship to Axel Rudakubana and sent their \"deepest sympathies\" to everyone impacted.\n\nThey said: “Our deepest sympathies go out to everyone impacted by this shocking case, and we have removed the video from all of our platforms out of respect to them.”\n\nIt's understood the promotional video was filmed in Blackpool, when Rudakuban was on the books of Ology Kids Casting, an agency based in nearby Ormskirk in Lancashire.\n\nIt's been reported by the MailOnline that the agency deleted a series of Facebook posts about Axel's budding acting career on Thursday night.\n\nRadakubana, who was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents, was said to have keen on singing during his school years and was part of the local church choir. He is reported to have joined drama group at his school to meet friends, and eventually performed on a West End show at London's Shaftesbury Theatre.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 17, is accused of murdering Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine at a dance studio in Southport, Merseyside. He is also accused of 10 attempted murders, including those of eight more children as well as dance teacher Leanne Lucas, 35, and businessman John Hayes who ran to help."
