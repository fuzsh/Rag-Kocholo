        "text": "Doctor Who season 14 spoilers follow.\n\nDoctor Who has confirmed the time slot for a special Tales of the TARDIS episode airing this week.\n\nThe spinoff series, which streams on the BBC iPlayer and airs on TV on BBC Four, debuted last year as part of Doctor Who's 60th anniversary and features classic stories being updated with new scenes and special effects.\n\nIn this case, Tales of the TARDIS will launch a new episode on Thursday (June 20) from 8pm on BBC Four and iPlayer in a 75-minute block.\n\nThe classic serial shown will be 'Pyramids of Mars', which will be edited into a feature-length omnibus in light of last weekend's Doctor Who episode bringing back the villain Sutekh the Destroyer.\n\nRelated: Doctor Who merchandise and biggest summer deals\n\nThe new material in this Tales of the TARDIS will feature The Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) and Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) pausing their epic battle against Sutekh to reflect on their travels thus far.\n\nTales of the TARDIS's new scene will lead directly into this Saturday's (June 22) season 14 finale 'Empire of Death', where The Doctor and Ruby must stop Sutekh's evil plan.\n\n'Pyramids of Mars' originally aired in 1975 as a Fourth Doctor story, starring Tom Baker as The Doctor, Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, and Gabriel Woolf voicing \"god of all gods\" Sutekh.\n\nWoolf has returned to Doctor Who for 'The Legend of Ruby Sunday' and 'Empire of Death' at age 91 — nearly 50 years after his first appearance in the series.\n\nRelated: How to get Doctor Who's three new Ncuti Gatwa books on sale\n\nDoctor Who's executive producer Phil Collinson has said of this week's Tales of the TARDIS episode: \"Revisiting the rich history of Doctor Who is endlessly thrilling, and this is no exception. It’s so exciting to bring back Tales of the TARDIS again and to revisit a classic enemy of the Doctor.\n\n\"Gabriel Woolf as Sutekh, returning to terrify a whole new generation of children in a blistering season finale, is what makes this show so special and appeal to so many across the generations.”\n\nDoctor Who debuts new episodes at midnight on Saturday, airing on BBC One in the UK and Disney+ elsewhere. Classic episodes of Doctor Who are available on BBC iPlayer in the UK.\n\nInterested in talking about Doctor Who? Visit our dedicated sub-forum\n\nYou Might Also Like"
