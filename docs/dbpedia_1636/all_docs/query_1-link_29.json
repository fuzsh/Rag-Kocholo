A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared.\n\n“This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. I will endeavour my utmost to do the same.”\n\nHe is expected to make his first appearance as the 14th Doctor in 2023.\n\nSpeaking of the end of her time on the show, Whittaker said: “This family grows and it will be bigger than us and it will go on, and Ncuti will be extraordinary and he will bring an audience that we haven’t reached and his performance will be so magical.\n\n“I’m certainly not going to give that phenomenal actor any advice, he doesn’t need it from me. Just, it’s yours to own and you’ve earned it.”\n\nWho are the previous Doctors?\n\nIn order of appearance, here are all the actors who have played the iconic Time Lord over the decades.\n\nWilliam Hartnell 1963 – 1966\n\nPatrick Troughton 1966 – 1969\n\nJohn Pertwee 1970 – 1974\n\nTom Baker 1974 – 1981\n\nPeter Davidson 1981 – 1984\n\nColin Baker 1984 – 1986\n\nSylvester McCoy 1987 – 1989\n\nPaul McGann 1996\n\nChristopher Eccleston 2005\n\nDavid Tennant 2005 – 2010\n\nMatt Smith 2010 – 2013\n\nPeter Capaldi 2013 – 2017\n\nJodie Whittaker 2017 – present\n\nThe centenary special Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor will air on Sunday 23 October on BBC One at 7.30pm"
