        "text": "Tales of the TARDIS launches the Whoniverse by bringing back some of Doctor Who’s most loved Doctors and companions for six nostalgia heavy scenes\n\nRussell T Davies promised that the 60th Anniversary celebrations would contain lots of surprises and so far he hasn’t disappointed. Though possibly the manner in which they casually revealed six new Doctor Who minisodes, Tales of the TARDIS, just days before they dropped on iPlayer is the biggest yet. They’re exclusive to iPlayer, and therefore the United Kingdom. And they’re a vital part of the plan to get British fans to check out the new Whoniverse iPlayer channel. It’s a gateway to almost every episode of Doctor Who from 1963 to the present day, as well as all the spin-offs like Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures. With lots of other content besides, it’s the most ambitious ever project in the show’s online life.\n\nNew outings for the Fifth Doctor and Tegan, and the Seventh Doctor and Ace, are sweet but come too soon after Power of the Doctor to be truly effective\n\nAs it turns out, more than anything else they’ve designed Tales of the TARDIS to encourage fans old and new to check out some of those classic episodes. Each short narrative wraps itself around a new omnibus edit of an existing serial. Essentially they serve as an in-character introductions to the stories. Pairs of former travellers in the TARDIS find themselves summoned to the ‘Memory TARDIS.’\n\nThere they catch up, hug it out, and then launch into their memories of past adventures. It’s a rigid format that doesn’t leave a lot of room in each six minute minisode for anything much deeper. In the cases of Earthshock (pairing the Fifth Doctor and Tegan) and The Curse of Fenric (the Seventh Doctor and Ace) they also suffer from comparison to recent, better, variations of the same idea. Even so, they’re still full of sweet moments. Tegan wears the Doctor’s panama hat and Ace does her best Scottish accent for an imprrRRrresion of McCoy. But combinations we hadn’t seen before might have better represented these eras. How emotional would it have been, for instance, to see Peter Davison’s Doctor confronted by Matthew Waterhouse as the memory of the man Adric would have grown up to be?\n\nKaty Manning is still a force of nature as Jo, teaming up with Sarah Jane Adventures’ Clyde for the Whoniverse’s most fun and surprisingly heartfelt new Tale\n\nSurprisingly, by far the most satisfying of these Tales is the most seemingly random. The Three Doctors is introduced by Jo Jones and Clyde Langer. The two had previously met during the Death of the Doctor storyline on The Sarah Jane Adventures. Even so, reuniting them to introduce Doctor Who’s tenth anniversary adventure appears at first glance an unlikely choice. But it works incredibly well. That’s in part because it is one person who was there relating it to someone who wasn’t. It’s in contrast to the other Tales where two people rehash their shared experiences and things they both already know.\n\nIt’s also one of the only ones to really push forward its characters’ personal stories. Jo grapples with being a widow who’s outlived the love of her life, and helps Clyde with his quarter life crisis, offering good advice on grabbing love while you can. Squint a little and it even feeds neatly into Big Finish’s recent outings for the characters.\n\nBut above everything else, it works because Katy Manning is a barely diminished force of nature. A whirlwind of energy she pivots from knockabout comedy to heartfelt emotionality with grace and speed. Meanwhile, Daniel Anthony, apart from not having aged a day, hasn’t lost a step in playing Clyde. He’s still expertly portrays the regular guy able to point out how weird this life actually is.\n\nTales for Time Meddler and Mind Robber see the casts slip almost effortless back into character in some cases half a century on from their last appearances\n\nThe Time Meddler and The Mind Robber, provide reunions for Vicki and Steven, and Jamie and Zoe, respectively. They’re also both pretty delightful. There’s something magical about how quickly these veterans of 1960s Doctor Who snap back into place. Steven and Vicki have only just acknowledged how old and grown up they are now, before Vicki is instantly looking for mischief and pooh poohing the fretting Steven as a ‘spoil sport.’\n\nConsidering O’Brien effectively retired from acting decades ago, she’s a bit of a revelation here. If she had a mind to it, she’d be primed for a fine line in impish older lady detectives.\n\nWendy Padbury as Zoe is another who easily slips back into her old performance. The bobbed hair may now be white, and she may have acquired a gown in place of her catsuit (if no less sparkly.) But every atom in all the old energy and enthusiasm is here. In contrast, Frazer Hines takes the opposite, but equally satisfying, tact. Sinking gratefully into his armchair, this is a Highlander who has led a long, tough life. He’s collected regrets over the decades and is now facing the discovery of yet more he’s forgotten.\n\nAfter all, with shades of what happened much later with Donna Noble, both Jamie and Zoe had their memories erased by the Time Lords on leaving the Doctor. And it’s their contrasting responses to getting their memories back that powers their dynamic. Jamie is fearful they’ll lose them again if they step outside the TARDIS. Zoe is confident and optimistic that they’re back for good. Neither able to know for sure. It makes for one of the Tales’ most touching scenes.\n\nThe Sixth Doctor and Peri’s reunion is probably the least successful Tale, saddled with the legacy of one of Who’s most unconvincing companion departures\n\nBringing up the rear, Vengeance on Varos provides the weakest of these Tales of the TARDIS. Nothing about it quite works. Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant are really only barely in character and dressed in what looks distinctly like their own clothes. While the script tries to see how many times you can say the phrase “warrior queen” in six minutes. Mostly, the fault for this lies back in 1986, and Peri having one of the most implausible and unsatisfying companion departures of all. There have been attempts in various media to retcon it, expand on it, and undo it over the years since. But as far as this Tale goes, it feels like nobody at any level really believes in it, even as they do their best to paint it as a happy ending for the character.\n\nAs endearing as they are slight, the Tales of the TARDIS are a lovely bonus for iPlayer users, but not worth international fans getting upset about missing out on\n\nUltimately these little slices of Doctor Who swing for big emotions and inevitably sometimes hit and sometimes miss. It’s hard to say how effective an introduction they are for new viewers, each one instantly leaping into the deep end of the show’s lore. The budget may be cheap and cheerful. Certainly, the magpie console room set gives a distinct wobble whenever buttons are pressed. But that might be a good transition into the classic stories for fans used to modern VFX.\n\nFew would call Tales of the TARDIS absolutely essential. Fans outside the UK definitely needn’t be that aggrieved about missing out. But for those who’ve already grown to love these characters, this is a lovely, and lovingly made, revisitation, all the sweeter for having been so unexpected.\n\nAll episodes of Tales of the TARDIS are now available on iPlayer’s Whoniverse channel\n\nDoctor Who returns on the 25th of November with The Star Beast on BBC One in the UK and Ireland, and Disney+ worldwide"
