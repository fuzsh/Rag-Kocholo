        "text": "BBC viewers were left sobbing as they witnessed a doctor who contracted coronavirus have his heart restarted.\n\nSurviving the Virus: My Brother & Me saw the journey of twin brothers Dr Chris and Dr Xand Van Tulleken, who you might recognise from TV show Operation Ouch, at the time covid-19 began its grip on the UK.\n\nNormally, Chris works as an infectious diseases doctor at the world-leading UCL Hospital in London, but during lockdown he was asked to return to work on the wards for the first time in ten years.\n\nSpecialist in public health Xand has worked in medical emergencies around the world, but after contracting covid in March, he was left with an irregular heartbeat - something he suspects is part of the aftermath of having the virus.\n\nAt one shocking moment in the documentary, Xand is admitted onto the very ward that his brother is working on.\n\nXand said that it felt like his “heart was doing a marathon” while he was “sitting doing nothing”.\n\nDoctors then announced that they would have to use an electric shock to jolt his heart back to normal.\n\nChris said: “The anesthetics team are going to give him an electric shock like you see in the movies. They restart the heart.\n\n“You’re not entirely sure whether the heart is going to start again.\n\n\"When you're twin - we're not telepathic, but Xand is half my identity. There's no one I'm closer to.\"\n\nAs his heart was shocked, Xand flatlined and for agonising moments Chris tearfully watched on as doctors brought him back to life.\n\nChris admitted: \"I wasn't expecting the flatline for so long afterwards.\n\n\"It wasn't nice watching it being done.\"\n\nAfter recovering from his ordeal, Dr Xand explained that he is far from being out of the woods yet.\n\n\"I got a real sense today of how unpleasant it is being ill. How unpleasant it is having stuff done to you,” he said as he walked out of the hospital.\n\n\"I'm obviously anxious about it because every time it happens, I have to come in and get defibrillated.\n\n\"I'm frustrated and I feel uncertain. I feel apprehensive. If I knew it was going to keep happening and I knew when and all the triggers and everything, that would be a bit easier.\n\n\"But it might be nothing or it might be a thing that dogs me for years to come, and I don't like not knowing.\"\n\nThe emotional scenes led to viewers sobbing themselves.\n\nOne tweeted: “Crying already. Hits home, makes me thankful that my Nan, who has COPD, and had 3 visits to the hospital during lockdown, didn’t catch this horrible virus. My heart aches for those affected by COVID.”\n\nA second said: “So incredible of @DoctorChrisVT and @xandvt to share their story. Terrifying to watch Chris watch his twin flatline and wait for his heart to restart.”\n\nA third posted: “Omg, this is breaking my heart. All these people are so incredible.”\n\nAnother urged: “Everyone should watch #survivingthevirus, so heartbreaking! Love the #vantulleken brothers.”"
