        "text": "Think it's just the heat stopping you from having a good night's sleep? Here's why it could actually be down to the time you take a shower.\n\nA sleep scientist has shared that pushing back the time when you have a hot bath or shower could add hours to your sleep and improve your comfort.\n\nDr Cheri Mah explains that washing in hot temperatures right before bed conflicts your body's heat, while eating particular foods can also keep you up at night.\n\nExplaining all, she shared: \"I would encourage you to shift that timing a little bit earlier into the night, so an hour and a half before you are planning to go to bed, I would shift your shower. Because, when you are taking a hot bath or a hot shower, it increases your core temperature but when you fall asleep, your core temperature drops.\"\n\nShe went on to say: \"So, you don't want that competing signal to be right before bedtime, but if you back that shower up an hour and a half, that should be a sufficient time that we think potentially there's an augmentation of helping that drop in temperature.\"\n\nDr Mah adds studies have shown that this method can also help decrease the time it takes you to fall asleep and enhance a deeper rest.\n\nAdditionally, it helps with \"muscle recovery and rejuvenation\", which you gain more of in the earlier stages of the night.\n\nThe sleep scientist says improving your sleep this way is \"an easy fix\" for those believing showering before bed is best.\n\nAs well as the time you shower, the professor, who specialises in the relationship between sleep and performance in elite athletes, reveals what foods you should avoid before sleep.\n\nIf you can't wait until the morning to eat, Dr Mah suggests avoiding a large meal that sits on your stomach before bed, and to opt for a healthy snack instead.\n\n\"50 per cent of a complex carb and 50 per cent of a lean protein, so for example cereal and milk is an easy one,\" she shared on the Diary Of A CEO podcast.\n\nElaborating on this point, she says \"wholegrain\" cereals are the best option, instead of sugary ones.\n\nAdditionally, she lists; cottage cheese, fruit, nuts and 100 percent whole wheat crackers with peanut, as good pre-sleep snacks.\n\nThese options will \"slowly digest\" through the night and are likely to prevent you from waking up.\n\nShe adds: \"We want it to be able to get you to the morning time and then you will fuel when you wake up.\"\n\nWhat you should avoid eating and drinking before bed are fatty foods, and caffeine or alcohol.\n\nThose who suffer from acid-reflux should also not opt for tomato-based foods before bedtime as this could \"aggravate\" the condition."
