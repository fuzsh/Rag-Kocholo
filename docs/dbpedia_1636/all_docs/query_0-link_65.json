The other repeat was 1967's The Evil of the Daleks.\n\n48.

The role went to Martin Freeman, but Moffat remembered Smith when casting for the Eleventh Doctor.\n\n49. When Benedict Cumberbatch auditioned for the part of Sherlock, he had spent the morning recording a Doctor Who audio drama with Sylvester McCoy.\n\n50.

It has been dubbed: \"The worst charity single of all time.\"\n\n57. Doctor Who met EastEnders in 3D for a charity special in 1993, with Phil and Grant Mitchell featuring, along with Pat Butcher and Pauline Fowler - but due to contracts signed at the time, it has never been repeated or released on DVD.\n\n58.
