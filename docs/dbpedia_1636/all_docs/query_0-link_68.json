        "text": "Rich in antioxidant compounds\n\nContain anti-cancer compounds\n\nAre antibacterial\n\nMay support heart health\n\nMay support bone health\n\nMay support gut health\n\nMay help regulate blood sugar\n\nMay support the respiratory system\n\nMay protect the digestive system\n\nMay help with weight management\n\nDiscover our full range of health benefit guides or check out some of our best onion recipes, from our tangy red onion chutney to our lighter onion tart.\n\nNutritional profile of onions\n\nAn 80g serving of onion (raw) provides:\n\nMore like this\n\n28kcal / 120kj\n\n0.8g protein\n\n6.4g carbohydrate\n\n5.0g sugars\n\n1.8g fibre\n\n2.0mg vitamin C\n\nOne medium onion or 80g counts as one portion of your five-a-day.\n\nAre onions good for you?\n\n1. Rich in antioxidant compounds\n\nOnions are loaded with plant compounds, including flavonoids, which have both a protective and anti-inflammatory effect. When consumed regularly and in sufficient quantity, these compounds may help protect against chronic conditions such as cancer and diabetes. In fact, onions contain over 25 different flavonoids and are one of the richest sources in our diets.\n\n2. Contain anti-cancer compounds\n\nOnions also contain sulfur-containing compounds, which have been shown to be protective against certain cancers. Some studies suggest that people who eat a diet rich in allium vegetables, like onions, have a lower risk of certain cancers including colorectal cancer. Although the evidence looks promising, clinical trials are needed to fully understand how onions may contribute towards this protection.\n\n3. They're antibacterial\n\nThey’ve been used in folk medicine for the relief of coughs, colds and catarrh for decades and now studies support the fact that onions have valuable antibacterial properties. These properties are effective against the likes of E.coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n\nWhat’s more, it’s the older stored onions that appear most potent. It’s a protective flavonoid called quercetin we have to thank here, because it has the power to inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n4. May support heart health\n\nQuercetin also has a protective anti-inflammatory effect and it’s thought that this, along with other beneficial compounds in onions, may contribute to the vegetable’s heart-friendly properties. Red onions have twice as much quercetin as white onions and a staggering 14 times the amount of that in garlic.\n\nStudies suggest eating onions may help reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering blood pressure, managing cholesterol levels and reducing inflammation.\n\n5. May support bone health\n\nIncluding onions in the diet is associated with improved bone density. This may be because of their protective antioxidant properties, which reduces oxidative stress and appears to reduce bone loss.\n\nA study looking at the effect on peri- and post-menopausal women reported that frequent onion consumption decreased the risk of hip fracture. A further study on middle-aged women showed onion juice consumption reduced bone loss and improved bone density.\n\n6. May support gut health\n\nOnions are rich in fibre, especially the non-digestible type that helps to maintain gut health. Although we can’t digest prebiotic fibre, the bacteria that live in our gut do and they use it as a fuel source to help increase their numbers and produce beneficial by-products called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Research shows that these SCFAs are important for maintaining the health and integrity of the gut and supporting our immunity and digestion.\n\nOnions do, however, contain inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides – these are classed as FODMAPs – types of carbohydrates that may be problematic for some people.\n\n7. May help regulate blood sugar\n\nIncluding onions in the diet may help regulate blood sugar levels; there is still much for us to learn in this area, but a small study of type 1 and 2 diabetics found eating 100g raw red onion significantly lowered fasting blood sugar after four hours.\n\nThis effect may once again be down to the plant compound quercetin, which appears to interact with cells in the small intestine, pancreas, liver and skeletal muscle.\n\n8. May support the respiratory system\n\nPotentially helpful for conditions like asthma and bronchitis, several studies suggest compounds in onions may relax the smooth muscle of the airways, improve allergic asthma and reduce inflammation in the lungs.\n\n9. May protect the digestive system\n\nIncluding onion in the diet may have a protective effect on the digestive system. To date, much of this research has been conducted on animal models but the findings suggest onion may mitigate gastric ulcers and alleviate colitis.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to assess whether these effects may be replicated in humans.\n\n10. May help with weight management\n\nSeveral animal studies and clinical trials have reported that onion may be effective in the prevention and management of obesity. One study assessed the effect of a 9g serving of onion powder per day for 12 weeks and reported that onion powder (and potentially its quercetin content) may reduce the risk of obesity and improve liver function. Similarly, an extract from steamed onion appeared to reduce total body fat and most notably abdominal visceral fat, in a group of overweight people.\n\nAre onions safe for everyone?\n\nAn allergy to onions is rare, but some people do have a sensitivity to them. As a result, these people may experience digestive issues, including heartburn and wind.\n\nAs onions contain FODMAPs, a type of carbohydrate and fibre that some people find their digestive system cannot tolerate, this is particularly relevant for those with a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nOverall, are onions good for you?\n\nOnions add flavour to a dish, are nutrient packed and contain potent plant compounds that may promote digestive health, immune function and heart health. For the majority of people onions make a useful addition to a balanced diet, however, those diagnosed with IBS may need to exercise caution.\n\nHealthy onion recipes\n\nAubergine dhal with tomato & onion raita\n\nCrunchy baked tomato & onion gratin\n\nSocca pancakes with hummus & lemony onions\n\nHealthier French onion soup\n\nEnjoyed this?
