        "text": "Beginning after the acquisition of the rights from Virgin Books in 1996, BBC Books published a number of original Doctor Who novels.\n\nNovels[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nSince 1973, Target Books had been the sole publisher of novel-length Doctor Who fiction. Its line of Target novelisations adapted every television episode in the \"Classic\" run of Doctor Who; it also published several short-lived series based on Doctor Who, including the Missing Episodes, Companions of Doctor Who, and Doctor Who Discovers. In 1986, during the lengthy gap between Doctor Who seasons 22 and 23, Virgin Books began its aquisition of Target, and this completed in late 1987. Two years later, television Doctor Who was cancelled.\n\nWhereas Virgin kept publishing novelisations of TV episodes under the Target imprint through 1994, in 1991 they began releasing original novels continuing the adventures of the Seventh Doctor and Ace. This monthly Virgin New Adventures series met success and spawned two spinoff series: the Missing Adventures, which depicted new adventures of earlier Doctors; and Decalog, a series of short story anthologies.\n\nIn 1996, taking note of Virgin's success and expecting the TV Movie to attract new fans, the BBC chose not to renew Virgin's license to publish Doctor Who fiction. Instead, the rights reverted to BBC Books. Although Virgin would continue its New Adventures and Decalog series without the license by focusing on the series' original characters, the last Virgin Doctor Who novel, Lungbarrow, was released in March 1997. While Virgin was concluding its series, BBC Books released a novelisation of the TV movie.\n\nTitle Author Doctor Featuring Published The Novel of the Film Gary Russell 8th The Bruce Master 16 May 1997\n\nInitial run[]\n\nFor its first five years of output, BBC Books continued the precedent set by Virgin's New Adventures and Missing Adventures lines by releasing two novels each month, one continuing an ongoing Eighth Doctor storyline and the other concerning a more standalone adventure of a previous Doctor. These are often divided by fans into \"Eighth Doctor Adventures\" and \"Past Doctor Adventures\".\n\nTitle Author Doctor Featuring Published The Eight Doctors Terrance Dicks 8th Samantha Jones 2 June 1997 The Devil Goblins from Neptune Martin Day and Keith Topping 3rd Liz Vampire Science Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum 8th Sam 7 July 1997 The Murder Game Steve Lyons 2nd Ben, Polly The Bodysnatchers Mark Morris 8th Sam 18 August 1997 The Ultimate Treasure Christopher Bulis 5th Peri Genocide Paul Leonard 8th Sam, Jo Grant, Benton 1 September 1997 Business Unusual Gary Russell 6th Mel War of the Daleks John Peel 8th Sam 6 October 1997 Illegal Alien Mike Tucker and Robert Perry 7th Ace Alien Bodies Lawrence Miles 8th Sam 24 November 1997 The Roundheads Mark Gatiss 2nd Ben, Polly, Jamie Kursaal Peter Anghelides 8th Sam 8 January 1998 The Face of the Enemy David A.

The books alternated between releases in the ongoing Eighth Doctor storyline and standalone stories about past Doctors, with the notable exception of Scream of the Shalka, which featured a Ninth Doctor and was published between an Eighth Doctor novel and a Fifth Doctor novel.\n\nTitle Author Doctor Featuring Published Time Zero Justin Richards 8th Fitz, Anji Kapoor, Trix 2 September 2002 Heritage Dale Smith 7th Ace 7 October 2002 The Infinity Race Simon Messingham 8th Fitz, Anji Kapoor 4 November 2002 Fear of the Dark Trevor Baxendale 5th Nyssa, Tegan 6 January 2003 The Domino Effect David Bishop 8th Fitz, Anji Kapoor 3 February 2003 Blue Box Kate Orman 6th Peri 3 March 2003 Reckless Engineering Nick Walters 8th Fitz, Anji Kapoor 7 April 2003 Loving the Alien Mike Tucker and Robert Perry 7th Ace 5 May 2003 The Last Resort Paul Leonard 8th Fitz, Anji Kapoor, Trix 2 June 2003 The Colony of Lies Colin Brake 2nd Jamie, Zoe 7 July Timeless Stephen Cole 8th Fitz, Anji Kapoor, Trix 4 August 2003 Wolfsbane Jacqueline Rayner 4th, 8th Sarah, Harry 1 September 2003 Emotional Chemistry Simon A.

Following this, the monthly series returned without the alternating Eighth Doctor novel pattern, as the Eighth Doctor was now a \"past Doctor\". The series concluded with BBC Books' first December release.\n\nTitle Author Doctor Featuring Published The Gallifrey Chronicles Lance Parkin 8th Fitz, Trix 2 June 2005 Island of Death Barry Letts 3rd Sarah 7 July 2005 Spiral Scratch Gary Russell 6th Mel 4 August 2005 Fear Itself Nick Wallace 8th Fitz, Anji 8 September 2005 World Game Terrance Dicks 2nd Serena 6 October 2005 The Time Travellers Simon Guerrier 1st Susan, Barbara, Ian 10 November 2005 Atom Bomb Blues Andrew Cartmel 7th Ace 25 December 2005\n\nThe new series[]\n\nMain article: BBC New Series Adventures\n\nThis section's awfully stubby.\n\nMissing content from BBC Books#Return to past Doctors.\n\nWith the return of Doctor Who to television in 2005, BBC Books began a new format for releases. These new books were oriented toward a younger audience and published in sets of three, a pattern that BBC Books would later reuse for the Torchwood novels. The series eventually settled into a spring-fall-winter release schedule of nine books a year.\n\nTitle Author Doctor Featuring Published The Clockwise Man Justin Richards 9th Rose 19 May 2005 The Monsters Inside Stephen Cole Winner Takes All Jacqueline Rayner The Deviant Strain Justin Richards 9th Rose, Jack 8 September 2005 Only Human Gareth Roberts The Stealers of Dreams Steve Lyons The Stone Rose Jacqueline Rayner 10th Rose, Mickey, Jackie 13 April 2006 The Feast of the Drowned Stephen Cole The Resurrection Casket Justin Richards Rose The Nightmare of Black Island Mike Tucker 10th 21 September 2006 The Art of Destruction Stephen Cole The Price of Paradise Colin Brake Sting of the Zygons Stephen Cole 10th Martha 19 April 2007 The Last Dodo Jacqueline Rayner Wooden Heart Martin Day Forever Autumn Mark Morris 10th Martha 6 September 2007 Sick Building Paul Magrs Wetworld Mark Michalowski Wishing Well Trevor Baxendale 10th Martha 26 December 2007 The Pirate Loop Simon Guerrier Peacemaker James Swallow Martha in the Mirror Justin Richards 10th Martha 10 April 2008 Snowglobe 7 Mike Tucker The Many Hands Dale Smith Ghosts of India Mark Morris 10th Donna 4 September 2008 The Doctor Trap Simon Messingham 10th Shining Darkness Mark Michalowski 10th The Story of Martha Various none Martha, the Saxon Master 26 December 2008 Beautiful Chaos Gary Russell 10th Donna, Wilf, Sylvia The Eyeless Lance Parkin none Judgement of the Judoon Colin Brake 10th Judoon 16 April 2009 The Slitheen Excursion Simon Guerrier Slitheen Prisoner of the Daleks Trevor Baxendale Daleks The Taking of Chelsea 426 David Llewellyn 10th Sontaran, Rutan Host 3 September 2009 Autonomy Daniel Blythe Autons, Nestene Consciousness The Krillitane Storm Christopher Cooper Krillitane\n\nThe novel release schedule took a six-month break during the showrunner transition from Russell T Davies to Steven Moffat."
