        "text": "Jodie Whittaker began her five-year era of Doctor Who by making history as the first ever woman Doctor. She ended it by taking in one last sunrise. “Doctor whoever I’m about to be,” she told her successor, skin beginning to glow, “tag, you’re it.\n\nBut she ended up passing the baton backwards, rather than forwards. The rumours were true: in a shocking twist, the Doctor has somehow regenerated back into Tenth Doctor, David Tennant. “What? What?! WHAT?!” he shouted. Indeed. It was nearly enough to make everything that preceded it irrelevant.\n\nThe Power of the Doctor, a BBC centenary special, was a passable finish to a flawed and uneven era. Written by showrunner Chris Chibnall, it was light on its feet, playful, and yet quite unremarkable in its thin, frenzied plotting.\n\nWe had “Cyber-Masters” robbing a train, famous paintings vanishing from galleries, missing seismologists, a child who was in fact a big ball of sentient energy, a big metal planet built next to 17th century Earth, Daleks trying to ignite all of Earth’s volcanoes, Cybermen infiltrating UNIT, the Doctor apparently dying and coming back as a hologram, and behind it all, The Master (Sacha Dhawan), who had united the Doctor’s greatest foes against her. Busy is an understatement.\n\nIt would have completely fallen apart if not for Dhawan’s deliciously unhinged final turn as the Master holding things together – he is a villain more concerned with pulling pranks than making sense. Was there a logical reason why he was disguised as Rasputin in Nicholas II’s Russia? Or was the whole thing simply an excuse for him to dance to Boney M’s “Rasputin”, while Daleks and Cybermen looked on in bemusement?\n\nThe Master’s big idea was “forced regeneration”: to not only kill the Doctor, but to make her regenerate into him, so that he could take her place, her TARDIS and her reputation. It was a bizarre plan, a body swap without the swap, but an interesting one: forcing us to consider the Doctor as an idea rather than a person. Alas, it amounted to little more than the sight of the Master wearing a mishmash of past Doctor outfits.\n\nAs a BBC centenary special, this was steeped in nostalgia, with past companions Ace (Sophie Aldred) and Tegan (Janet Fielding) returning to aid UNIT in their fight against the Cybermen and the Daleks.\n\nNaturally, there were plenty of references and callbacks, including a poignant sequence in which former Doctors Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann made cameo appearances via some sort of wibbly-wobbly plot nonsense. It was worth it to see McCoy back in his outfit, I suppose.\n\nWhittaker was exuberant and charismatic as ever, once again polishing material that didn’t give her Doctor the justice she deserves. I can forgive there being no reference to the big arc of this era – the Doctor’s long-lost memories. I can even forgive the Doctor, not for the first time, being reduced to a passive passenger (this time via hologram) in her own show.\n\nBut the most egregious mistake was the absence of romantic pay-off between the Doctor and companion Yaz (Mandip Gill). To have planted the seeds of a burgeoning love story and then have them part more as mates than lovers, without even a kiss, was a missed opportunity at best, and queer baiting at worst. It was symbolic of this chapter of Doctor Who: the most noble of intentions, the most likeable of actors, but stories and scripts that felt incomplete, punctuated by odd beats and jarring character decisions.\n\nHere’s hoping that the return of David Tennant, along with the return of showrunner Russell T Davies and new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, can lead the show into a brighter future."
