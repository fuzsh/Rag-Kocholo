        "text": "BBC to air special programmes for Michael Mosley\n\nThe BBC has announced that it will air two special tributes to TV presenter Dr Michael Mosley following his death on the Greek island of Symi.\n\nOne of the programmes will include a recording of the last interview he conducted.\n\nDr Mosley's remains were found in a rocky area on Sunday - four days after he went missing while on holiday.\n\nAn initial post-mortem examination concluded on Monday that he died of natural causes.\n\nSeparate toxicology and histology reports have been ordered but the results have not yet been released.\n\nThe first of the two programmes, There's Only One Michael Mosley, will air on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds at 11:00 BST on Friday 14 June.\n\nIt will feature the last interview Dr Mosley conducted, recorded in the BBC tent as part of the Hay Festival in May.\n\nFor the interview, titled How to Live a Good Life, Dr Mosley spoke to Paul Bloom, Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Cognitive Science at Yale University.\n\nThe BBC says it sees the presenter \"at his best, full of warmth, insight and thoroughly enjoying his time with the audience\".\n\nA second special programme, Michael Mosley - The Doctor Who Changed Britain, will air on BBC One and iPlayer on Friday 14 June at 20:00 BST.\n\nThe programme will \"look back at an extraordinary broadcasting career which spanned almost 40 years\", the BBC says.\n\nDr Mosley, who studied medicine in London and qualified as a doctor, was known for BBC TV programmes including Trust Me, I'm a Doctor, and Radio 4's Just One Thing podcast. He also wrote a column for the Daily Mail.\n\nHe was an advocate for intermittent fasting diets, including through the 5:2 diet and The Fast 800 diet.\n\nThe 67-year-old father-of-four was reported missing after he set off for a walk from Agios Nikolaos beach - near where he was staying on the northeast side of the island - at about 13:30 local time (11:30 BST) on Wednesday.\n\nDespite an extensive search by the Greek authorities, his body was not found near Agia Marina beach until Sunday by local journalists, staff and the mayor.\n\nThe owner of Agia Marina, Michalis Antoniadis, told the BBC he is still in shock and feels guilt that Dr Mosley was not found sooner.\n\n\"We did our best,\" he said, adding that he was \"very sorry\" about the outcome.\n\nIt is thought that Dr Mosley died at around 16:00 (14:00 BST) on Wednesday, the day he went missing.\n\nPolice said the initial conclusion that he died of natural causes was based on the position his body was found in, as well as a lack of injuries.\n\nThe BBC has seen CCTV footage, taken near the Agia Marina beach bar, which appears to show Dr Mosley disappear from view as he slowly makes his way down a hillside close to where his body was later found. He then collapses out of view behind a wall.\n\nNew CCTV seen on Tuesday shows Dr Mosley walking through Pedi.\n\nHe is seen heading for a trail that leads towards Agia Marina 1.5 miles away, where he died.\n\nTributes to Dr Mosley have continued to pour in from both his former colleagues and members of the public.\n\nFriend and fellow broadcaster Dr Hannah Fry told the BBC's One Show about an instance in which Dr Mosley had saved a woman's life.\n\n\"Somebody collapsed in the BBC offices in the corridors, and he saw them collapse,\" said Dr Fry.\n\n\"He went over, he performed CPR on them for almost half an hour until the emergency services arrived.\n\n\"[He] saved her life, she's gone on to have two children.\"\n\nOne member of the public said that Dr Mosley \"had the ability to reach out to all walks of life\", while another said that she often uses his advice about breathing slowly to calm anxiety."
