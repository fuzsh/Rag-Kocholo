I'm writing a straight western with no supernatural trappings whatsoever. What's the one thing you haven't had an opportunity to do yet that you want to try?\"\n\nJOE HILL: \"I'll tell you the one thing that I've been wanting to do that I'll never get a chance to do. So, you know I'm a big Doctor Who geek, right?\"\n\nKEENE: \"Right.\"\n\nHILL: \"This is a true story.\"\n\nCHRISTOPHER GOLDEN: \"Okay.\"\n\nHILL: \"So…I'm a huge Doctor Who geek. Watching Doctor Who…watching the David Tennant Doctor Who with my boys was a really happy part of their childhood, and of me being a dad. And I had some ideas for Doctor Who, and I really wanted to write for that show. And my screen agent got me a chance to pitch on it. So, i spent a month and a half working on three pitches, and man, I have never imagined harder in my whole life. I mean, I just worked so hard on these things. And by chance, I actually wound up spending a weekend with Neil Gaiman. We were in the same place at the same time, and hanging out a lot, and he actually edited my pitches. He actually went through the pitches and was like, 'Yes do this. Don't do that. This is a good idea. Hate this idea.' You know? And I'm like, you couldn't ask for a better editor!\"\n\nGOLDEN: \"Of course!\"\n\nHILL: \"And so I, you know, with trepidation and my heart in my mouth, I sent in my pitches, and a couple weeks passed, and I got…the email I got back said, 'We have never let an American write Doctor Who, and if we were going to, we wouldn't start with you.\"\n\nKEENE: \"Oh my god!\n\nGOLDEN: \"Oh come on! Are you fucking kidding me?\"\n\nKEENE: \"Oh my god!\"\n\n(Hill and Keene burst into laughter)\n\nHILL: \"Is that not the most smoking rejection of all time?\"\n\nKEENE: \"Jesus…\"\n\nHILL: \"I remain in awe. I remain in awe. It's still my favorite rejection.\""
