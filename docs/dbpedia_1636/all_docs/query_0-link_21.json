        "text": "BBC Studios announces that the Doctor will be landing in the popular online video game Fortnite. Players will take on new adventures, missions and battles, while exploring iconic locations from the Whoniverse, all on a brand-new Doctor Who island within the game.\n\nWhen the mysterious Reality Virus causes the TARDIS to appear on the island, players must help repair it by finding the parts to fix the Dynamorphic generators.\n\nThe game starts on the TARDIS Landing Site where players will find the TARDIS and start their quest to gather the Dynamorphic Generator Crystals from around the hub island in order to repair it. Special rewards and surprises will keep players on their toes along the way.\n\nFrom the TARDIS Landing Site, head to one of the remaining four locations. Travel to Kerblam! on the moon of Kandoka to experience box fighting like never before, with the Kerblam Man looking on.\n\nOn the Escape Map, players must escape the QuadZone Rescue Space Craft while stopping the destructive Pting, an alien that is causing chaos by eating the ship’s systems. As the self-destruct sequence has been initiated players must find all 10 mechanical parts to repair the Life Pod and escape.\n\nThe Reality Virus has caused many realities to coexist on Gallifrey. On the Rumble Map players will choose a team and their weapon loadout to fight for either the Time Lords or the Daleks in an all-out battle.\n\nMat Way, Global Director, Gaming & Interactive at BBC Studios, said: “Developing an island in Fortnite is new territory for Doctor Who and we’re excited to welcome the game’s established players into the Whoniverse. This is a great opportunity to introduce a gaming audience to Doctor Who and also for the existing community to experience a brand-new adventure. Players can expect a fast-paced, unpredictable journey with familiar friends and foes making appearances along the way.”\n\nFor those interested in learning more about the Doctor’s world, they can head to the Doctor Who Museum. Here there’s more info about the famous friends and foes of the Doctor, including the Cybermen, Daleks, Weeping Angels, K9 and the TARDIS.\n\nPlayers can visit the Doctor Who island for free by downloading Fortnite on their preferred device or console. From the main menu, change game mode, select “Island Code” and enter code 3610-1396-4646. The Doctor Who Island will be available for Fortnite players to discover and explore from 17th March.
