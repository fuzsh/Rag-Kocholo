        "text": "EDUCATION\n\nM.S. Brandeis University (Applied Mathematics)\n\nM.A. Brandeis University (Mathematics)\n\nB.S. Penn State University (Mathematics)\n\nWHY NEWMAN?\n\nI chose the Newman School for its global and diverse community. The students and faculty at Newman come from many places and have distinctive life experiences. From my short interaction with a mentor at Newman, I know that this is the place that I can continue to grow as a teacher and serve the intellectually-hungry scholars on their own exploration of mathematics.\n\nWHEN DID YOU START AT NEWMAN?\n\n2023\n\nHOW WILL YOU BRING “HEART SPEAKS TO HEART” INTO YOUR TEACHING OR INVOLVEMENT WITH STUDENTS?\n\nAs I shift away from the traditional style of teaching and adopt \"flipped learning\", the students and I have experienced the Newman School's \"Heart Speaks to Heart\" in our math classes. By stepping back and letting the students explore, we naturally learn how to build a community in which collaboration and trying out new things are highly encouraged. My heart wants to speak to the hearts of my students that the journey is as equally important, if not more, than the destination itself.\n\nHOW WILL YOU USE THE “CITY AS OUR CAMPUS?”\n\nI plan to use the City of Boston \"as our campus\" by taking advantages of resources provided by the local universities and organizations. It is great to be in a place where scholars and talents come to gather, learn, and exchange ideas.\n\nWHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?\n\nEnglish and Vietnamese\n\nTELL US A FUN FACT ABOUT YOURSELF!\n\nIn creative writing we might walk out into the park or into the street to observe the world and nature as inspiration for writing.Trips to see a Shakespeare play or other theatrical production are possible as well.\n\nWHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?\n\nEnglish and Dutch\n\nTELL US A FUN FACT ABOUT YOURSELF!\n\nI lived in The Netherlands for 23 years but... I went to high school around the corner from Newman, at what is now Snowdon International School! The building is exactly the same. Small world and back to where I started! Also, I'm writing a novel.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nM.A. University of Paris III: La Sorbonne Nouvelle\n\nB.A. University of Paris III: La Sorbonne Nouvelle\n\nWHY NEWMAN?\n\nNewman also offered me the opportunity to teach multiple different subjects that I really enjoy, and to delve deeper into particular subjects that interest me, as I have a lot of freedom in creating my own curriculum.\n\nWHEN DID YOU START AT NEWMAN?\n\n2022\n\nHOW WILL YOU BRING “HEART SPEAKS TO HEART” INTO YOUR TEACHING OR INVOLVEMENT WITH STUDENTS?\n\nI believe that one of the most crucial aspects of teaching involves building relationships and trust with students and encouraging them to pursue topics that interest them. These interests should be accepted, cultivated, and encouraged, while the students build up their skills and their confidence.\n\nHOW WILL YOU USE THE “CITY AS OUR CAMPUS?”\n\nI encourage students to treat some of the amazing city resources, such as the Boston Public Library, or the French Library, as part of the school campus, and to continually take advantage of Newman's proximity to these institutions.\n\nWHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?\n\nEnglish\n\nRussian\n\nFrench\n\nSpanish\n\nTELL US A FUN FACT ABOUT YOURSELF!\n\nEDUCATION\n\nM.Ed. Rutgers Graduate School of Education (ELA Education)\n\nB.A. Rutgers University (English)\n\nWHY NEWMAN?\n\nI chose Newman because of its Cor Ad Cor Loquitur philosophy. At Newman, teachers get to serve many roles in helping students live and grow. Newman affords each of us abundant opportunities to apply our talents, share them with others, and learn from one another. I believe a school should be a second home, and a site for the development of not only academics, but people and communities. Newman is the kind of school that makes such things possible.\n\nHOW WILL YOU BRING “HEART SPEAKS TO HEART” INTO YOUR TEACHING OR INVOLVEMENT WITH STUDENTS?\n\nI like to get to know my students outside of the classroom. Knowing their interests, passions, and dreams not only helps me teach them better, but allows me to infuse their learning with such topics, and to advocate for them inside and outside of class. Newman's advisory system, myriad clubs, and location afford many opportunities to explore and enrich our learning outside of the classroom. At the end of the day, so much of school is about community and about relationships. My love for my students, and my desire to advocate for them, their growth, and their needs is at the forefront of why I teach.\n\nHOW WILL YOU USE THE “CITY AS OUR CAMPUS?”\n\nI'm looking forward to taking Newman students to the Boston Public Library for projects, as well as to the Museum of Fine Arts and other more local and contemporary galleries around the city. I'm also excited to explore the banks of the Charles River, and the beautiful greenery around the city. Much of literature comes from and intersects with our experience of landscape, nature, and arts of many kinds. Whether it's discussions we'll be holding outdoors, silent walks for inspiration, or analytical expeditions to galleries, I want my students to see that learning isn't limited to the classroom or to the 45 minutes we have in it each day.\n\nWHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?\n\nEnglish\n\nsome Spanish\n\nsome Mandarin Chinese\n\nTELL US A FUN FACT ABOUT YOURSELF!\n\nI'm an avid player of the TTRGP, Dungeons and Dragons. I've been gamemastering it since I was a kid, and playing as well. I hadn't played for many years, but returned to it during the six years I spent living and teaching in Shenzhen, China. It's since become a way I have of staying in touch with old and new friends, as well as exercising creativity, community, my love of stories, and quite a lot of comedy. I used to act in plays and short films, and in D&D, my love of improv, narrative, and human experience are things I get to flex and enjoy around a table or a Zoom call with friends. I find it a healing, enriching, and riotously fun way to spend time.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAB Harvard College\n\nWHY NEWMAN?\n\nInitially, when I was looking to get into teaching, Newman was a nice environment to do an intern year. I moved to San Diego but always had Newman in mind, so when I moved back to Boston and a position in the Math Department opened up, I came back.\n\nWHEN DID YOU START AT NEWMAN?\n\n2010\n\nHOW WILL YOU BRING “HEART SPEAKS TO HEART” INTO YOUR TEACHING OR INVOLVEMENT WITH STUDENTS?\n\nAs a small school, I have the opportunity to get to know students, both in and out of the classroom. Additionally, Newman is a family-oriented school, so the longer I have been here, the more I have had the opportunity to get to know Newman families and friends.\n\nHOW WILL YOU USE THE “CITY AS OUR CAMPUS?”\n\nMainly, when helping with the tennis team, we go to different venues for tennis practices and matches.\n\nWHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?\n\nEnglish and French\n\nTELL US A FUN FACT ABOUT YOURSELF!\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.S. Salem State University (Mathematics and Civil Engineering)\n\nWHY NEWMAN?\n\nI choose Newman School after teaching for many years in many schools in the Boston area. In August 2007, I realized my true dream was to become a math teacher at Newman.\n\nWHEN DID YOU START AT NEWMAN?\n\n2007\n\nHOW WILL YOU BRING “HEART SPEAKS TO HEART” INTO YOUR TEACHING OR INVOLVEMENT WITH STUDENTS?\n\nI graduated from Salem State University with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in May 2001. I am proud to be a math teacher at Newman. I have a passion for helping all students at Newman reach their potential and I love to challenge them. I also want to be someone that all my students can rely on.\n\nWHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?\n\nEnglish\n\nFrench\n\nCreole\n\nTELL US A FUN FACT ABOUT YOURSELF!"
