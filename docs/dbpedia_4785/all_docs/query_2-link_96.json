He has been married to his wife, Andi, since 2009 and they have 3 kids together. His daughter Abbi, twin boys Alexander & Anderson, and their black lab Atticus. In his free time, he enjoys watching Florida State football, motorcycle/car racing, working out, and spending time with his family.\n\nReach out to Adam if you are looking for a financial professional who can build a comprehensive plan around insurance, investments, tax strategies, estate planning, and overall financial planning. He will coordinate with your team of advisors and values the personal service that he gives to each of his clients.\n\nErik’s Story\n\nErik began his career in Management Consulting by helping Fortune 500 companies solve large and complex financial and operational issues to help improve their top line work on saving their bottom line. In 2015, Erik took that skill set into private practice, and has since helped hundreds of individuals with their financial needs.

He will bring you the tools that you need and serve as your advocate in the financial planning space.\n\nMike’s Story\n\nMike is originally from Columbus, GA where he first experienced his love for the outdoors while living on a small farm with his family. Mike believes his hard work ethic comes from his days working with his family members on the farm, caring for the animals and crops that fed both him and his family. In his free time, he could be found in the woods, on the water, or playing sports. All of which he still enjoys today.\n\nMike moved to Florida with his mother and grandparents to the Tampa Bay Area in the 90s and Mike went on to pursue his BA in Finance. During this time he worked in the restaurant industry starting as a dishwasher and quickly working his way up to Manager. He was the first person ever in the restaurant’s history to achieve this feat under the age of 21. Upon graduation in 2003 Mike entered into financial services as a mortgage broker and remained in the industry until The Great Recession in 2008. Following the 2008 crisis, Mike transitioned to the financial planning industry. Once again, Mike worked his way from an Agent to a Managing Advisor with Western & Southern Financial. Mike made the decision 3 years later in 2016, to go independent because he would be able to offer his clients a broader array of products and services. Shortly after he was introduced by a mutual friend to Adam Taylor who was transitioning roles himself. They began collaborating together and jointly read Rocket Fuel by Gino Wickman which made them realize that if they worked together, they could create “Rocket Fuel” with their complementary skills. Mike’s focus was and still is on implementation and investment portfolios whereas Adam focuses on prospecting, community involvement, and vision.\n\nWhen Mike is not working, he enjoys spending time and traveling with his wife Melanie and their two kids.\n\nMike holds his FINRA Series 6, 7, 63, 65 and 2-14 and 2-40 licenses. Mike is a Member of the Investments & Wealth Institute (Member ID:191637)"
