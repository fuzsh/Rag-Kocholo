        "text": "What is BMUN?\n\nBerkeley Model United Nations (BMUN) is a student run organization at UC Berkeley dedicated to continuing its seven decades of excellence as the world’s premier, and very first, United Nations simulation. Over 2,000 high school students from all over the world come to Berkeley to participate in BMUN every year. Entering its 72nd session, BMUN’s mission is to spread awareness of international issues and the spirit of diplomacy through UN simulations. We also aim to create an educational experience for high school students to help them realize their potential in areas such as public speaking and policy debate. We do this by serving as chairs on a diverse group of committees in which we help to facilitate delegate education through substantive diplomatic debate.\n\nWe are not a travel team. Instead, we use our conference fees to fund our conference logistics, philanthropic mission, and member events."
