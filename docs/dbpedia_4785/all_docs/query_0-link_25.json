        "text": "The Berkeley Pit is a former open pit copper mine located in Butte, Montana, USA, about a mile and a half wide and about convert|1780|ft|m deep. It contains about convert|900|ft|m of water that is heavily acidic, with a pH level of 2.5, and laden with heavy metals and dangerous chemicals such as arsenic, cadmium, zinc, and sulfuric acid.\n\nThe mine was opened in 1955 and operated by Anaconda Copper and later by the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), until its closure in 1982. When the pit was closed, the water pumps at the bottom were removed, and groundwater sourced from the surrounding aquifers soon filled the pit to the natural groundwater level.\n\nThis has presented an environmental problem in that the water, with dissolved oxygen, allows pyrite and sulfide minerals in the ore and wall rocks to decay, releasing acid. The acidic water in the pit can carry a heavy load of dissolved heavy metals. The water contains so much dissolved metal (up to 187 ppm Cu) that \"mining\" of the water is actually done.\n\nIn the 1990s plans were devised for solving the groundwater problem. The Berkeley Pit has since become one of the largest Superfund sites.\n\nThe pit is currently a tourist attraction, with an adjacent gift shop. A $2 admission fee is charged to go out on the viewing platform.\n\nEarly history and development\n\nThe underground Berkeley Mine was located on a prominent vein extending to the southeast from the main Anaconda vein system. When open pit mining operations began in July 1955, near the Berkeley Mine shaft, the older mine gave its name to the pit. The open-pit style of mining superseded underground operations because it was far more economical: even very low-grade ore could be recovered using shovels and trucks, which were also less dangerous than underground mining.\n\nWithin the first year of operation, the pit extracted 17,000 tons of ore per day at a grade of 0.75% copper, meaning that about 127 tons of copper was produced from the ore. Ultimately, about 1,000,000,000 tons of material was mined from the Berkeley Pit [http://www.mbmg.mtech.edu/env-berkeley.htm] . Copper was the principal metal produced, together with subsidiary amounts of silver and gold.\n\nTwo communities and much of Butte's previously crowded east side were consumed by land purchases to expand the pit. The Anaconda Company bought the homes, businesses and schools of the working-class communities of Meaderville, East Butte, and McQueen, east of the pit site. Many of these homes were either destroyed, buried, or moved to the southern end of Butte with the residents being compensated market value for their lost property.\n\nEnvironmental effects"
