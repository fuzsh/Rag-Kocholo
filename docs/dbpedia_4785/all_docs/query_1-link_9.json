        "text": "Beyond Taboos: Rethinking Education for a Changing World. The 20th Annual York University Graduate Student Conference in Education will be taking place from May 6-8, 2024. This milestone year marks a bold exploration of uncharted territories within the field of education under the theme Beyond Taboos: Rethinking Education for a Changing World. I'm excited to present a paper in which I encapsulate my journey from being an artist to artist-educator, influenced by J Krishamurthy and Paulo Freire's educational philosophies in a borderless, fearless, inclusive teaching-learning environment.\n\nI cannot tell you how thrilled I am to be a part of Bay Path University and Cambridge College. Today is a transformational day for all of us here. I am incredibly proud of our fidelity to our missions, our commitment to the communities we serve, our teammates, and our impact on higher education. #StrongerTogether I am also grateful for you, Sandra J. Doran, Michael Giampietro, Kathleen Bourque, Natalia Blank, PhD, Stephen Healey, Niti Seth, Dennis J. Madigan, CMA, our Board of Trustees, and the rest of the teams that trusted me to lead Phase 1 of the acquisition. We did it! Special kudos to the Phase 1 project team; I am a better professional for working with you: Jeremy Anderson, Jessica Sabbagh (rock star), Brittany Riley, MBA, and Susan Poglinco, PhD (and the Core team). I am even more grateful for the continued confidence in me and our super-talented project team as we lead the next phase of this process: Tracy McLaughlin, Shirley Montovani, Madison McGrath, Jonathan Besse, and Susan Poglinco, PhD. Thank you for being tremendous partners, thought leaders, and accountability partners. I am super excited about the work ahead. Collectively, we will think holistically about what it means to serve students, how to continue to make a profound and lasting impact in our communities, and how to transform ourselves and our organization. #BayPathUniversityProud. #CambridgeCollegeProud. #Transformation.\n\nExcited to share that I have made the Chancellor's and Dean's Lists for Fall 2023. These academic milestones mean a lot to me, not just as a recognition of hard work, but as a reflection of my commitment to excellence, a value I will carry forward into my professional journey.
