        "text": "A Message From The Search Committee Chair\n\nJune 21, 2024\n\nOn behalf of the board of trustees and the head of school search committee, I am overjoyed to announce the appointment of Dr. Lori-Anne S. Brogdon as Mounds Park Academyâs fifth head of school in its 42-year history. Dr. Brogdon will assume the position on July 1, 2025, after Dr. Bill Hudsonâs retirement, to build upon his remarkable 12-year MPA tenure.\n\nReflecting on her appointment, Dr. Brogdon shared what drew her to MPA. âI felt welcomed in every space I visited and appreciated the incredibly thoughtful and necessary questions that were asked of me throughout my time on campus. Iâve always been a dreamer and I believe in pouring my efforts into everything I do. Dream big, do right is a motto that I can not only stand behind but can also stand with and champion for MPAâs community and beyond.â Read more from Dr. Brogdon in her letter to the community.\n\nAs a community, we have selected an exceptional leader who is deeply aligned with MPAâs core values and ready to move the schoolâs strategic priorities forward. In alignment with the position description, the search committee was particularly drawn to Dr. Brogdonâs strong yet approachable presence and extensive PreK-12 experience.\n\nWith 25 years of leading and teaching in schools, Dr. Brogdon comes to MPA after five years as head of school at Catherine Cook School, a preschool through grade eight independent school in Chicago, Illinois. While serving as head of school at Catherine Cook, Dr. Brogdon led a comprehensive strategic planning process, increased the faculty and staffâs collaboration and mission focus, furthered the schoolâs commitment to DEIB, increased support for students who are neurodiverse, and fostered the alignment of curriculum across the entire school. She also increased annual giving and managed a large capital building projectâall while navigating a global pandemic.\n\nTrustees, parents, and faculty at Catherine Cook described Dr. Brogdon as a collaborative yet decisive leader with high integrity. Michelle Kilkenney, former board chair, trustee, and former and current parent, shared, âLori-Anne dreams big, but is laser-focused on the goals.â Bhavan Suri, former trustee and current parent, described the deep passion and enjoyment she takes for informal interactions with the childrenâfrom playing games in the hallways to welcoming back alumni. She is relentless in building relationships and putting whatâs best for students of all ages at the center of her decision-making. She has deep expertise in progressive education and in curricular alignment that will serve MPA well in the years to come.\n\nPrior to Catherine Cook, Dr. Brogdon served as the assistant head of school and academic dean at Poly Prep Country Day School, a nursery through grade 12 school in Brooklyn, New York. Highlights of her time at Poly Prep include overseeing academic and co-curricular programs, developing more equitable hiring practices, and both supporting and advancing the academic leadership staff.\n\nDr. Brogdon also has extensive division leadership and classroom teaching experience across all grade levels. Sheâs served as a Middle School director and principal as well as a Lower, Middle, and Upper School math and science faculty member. She earned her B.A. at Connecticut College, her M.A. at Teachers College, Columbia University, and her Ed.D. at Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nDuring the 2024-25 school year, Dr. Brogdon will serve as interim head of school at Groves Academy, a PreK-12 school in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, for students with dyslexia, ADHD, executive function challenges, and other language-based learning disabilities.\n\nTHE SEARCH PROCESS & COMMUNITY SUPPORT\n\nSince the February 2024 announcement of Dr. Hudsonâs retirement, the head of school search committee has led a comprehensive effort in partnership with Bob Vitalo and Jennifer Wong Christensen, consultants at Carney, Sandoe & Associates. I am thankful for the extraordinary knowledge and work that resulted in a strong pool of exceptional candidates.\n\nTo ensure an open and transparent search, input was invited and gathered from all constituent groups through initial community meetings and a community survey from which the position description was written. The engagement continued as the committee presented three finalist candidates to the community by offering open Q&A forums and requesting feedback via finalist surveys.\n\nAfter deeply considering the communityâs input and recentering itself on the position description that emerged from the community, the head of school search committee unanimously recommended Dr. Brogdon. The board of trustees voted unanimously for her appointment as well.\n\nThroughout the search process, Dr. Brogdon emerged as the leader who best reflects the core attributes the community seeks in our next head of school. In the words of the MPA community:\n\nâDr. Brogdon brings a sense of purpose, collaboration, transparency, and doing whatâs right for kids. She has a sense of calm, directness, trust, and accountability. She has experience at all three divisional levels of the school, and different experiences as a learner. She has strong business/fundraising experience, and she is a relationship builder. I felt she embodied our vision of dream big, do right.â â faculty member\n\nâI liked how open she was during the discussion. She was not intimidating and seemed like she would be a great addition to the MPA community! She answered our questions effectively and with ease. She mentioned that she would sit-in on classes and overall appeared to align with MPA core values well. I would definitely be happy with her as the head of school.â â student\n\nâI appreciated that she says she is a servant leader and takes a collaborative and relationship-building approach to leadership. I felt as if my voice would be heard and considered if she were to be in this role. I also was impressed that she was personable, and you could tell that she was a person who is deep feeling and would care about the MPA community and its success.â â parent\n\nâSmart, thoughtful, compassionate, strategic, curious.â â alum\n\nI wish to extend heartfelt thanks to the members of the search committee and specifically to Betsy Van Hecke for her steadfast leadership of the search. I also want to thank all community members whose participation and engagement ensured a thorough, thoughtful, and inclusive search process. MPA demonstrated to Dr. Brogdon and the other finalists what a warm and welcoming community it truly is. It was made abundantly clear that the MPA community has a deep love and appreciation for the school and is committed to seeing it continue to flourish through the transition and under Dr. Brogdonâs leadership.\n\nMOVING FORWARD\n\nPlease watch for ways to celebrate the lasting impact of Dr. Bill Hudson throughout the coming year. Planning is underway for how we will honor his legacy while simultaneously welcoming Dr. Brogdon to the MPA community. Both are committed, in partnership with the board of trustees, administrative team, and the larger community, to working side-by-side to ensure a seamless and successful transition. Together, we will all see to it that our mission remains strong for many, many more years to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTiffany Scott Knox\n\nMPA Parent\n\nChair, Board of Trustees\n\nHEAD OF SCHOOL SEARCH COMMITTEE"
