        "text": "I’ve been lurking on this forum for a while and I now think I have some thoughts and observations to add. First, some background. My spouse and I both got our B.A.s and graduate degrees (in humanities fields) from Yale, I also went to graduate school at Oxford. Thanks to my career (in “the higher journalism”); my friendships with a lot of academics; my occasional lectures, talks, and seminars on campuses; and my family background (my dad was a university professor), I believe that I have a glimpse–a partial and distorted one, no doubt–into trends and developments in academe.\n\nOur son attends what has traditionally considered the most academically rigorous New England prep school. My spouse and I strongly encouraged his inclination to apply early to UChicago, and he was lucky enough to be admitted in December. His test scores, unusually rigorous course of study, very high GPA, national prizes, and high-achieving activities would have made him a competitive candidate for admission to any college. But he believes, and his parents have long believed, that the University of Chicago offers an unrivaled–and unique–learning environment. He loves drama and sports and certainly does not plan to pursue a career in academe, but he thinks that college is, or should be, well, primarily an intellectual activity and that the only real point of attending an institution of higher learning is to immerse oneself in “the life of the mind.” Given those priorities, and after visiting and/or querying friends at HYPS, etc., he became convinced that UChicago was the best place to continue his education.\n\nTo him, and to his parents, the main feature that distinguishes the College of the University Chicago from its peers is its longstanding and straightforward (and, in its own way, modest) embrace of its mission to provide its undergraduates with a rigorous education, and to define broadly for its students what they must learn to emerge from the College as educated people. That is, the College of UChicago still seems to define its goal almost wholly in scholarly and intellectual terms. Our son examined closely the explicit and implicit mission statements of, and the admissions policies pursued by, UChicago’s peer institutions. From that endeavor he came to believe that those schools elevate the pursuit of other goals, however worthy, as of equal or nearly importance to–and thus place those goals in competition with–their academic purpose.\n\nFrom my understanding, there’s really nothing new about this difference. The colleges of HYPS have always seen their primary mission as nurturing regional and national leaders through the inculcation and advancement of certain non-intellectual values. Those values have changed over time (from, say, a muscular Christianity, to a WASP-led progressivism, to today’s “social justice”), but the mission has remained the same. In contrast, it seems to us that UChicago takes and has always taken an academically and intellectually purer path. It has sought to train its students minds and has implicitly taken the position that what the College’s graduates choose to to do with their intellectual training is their business. It’s an approach that was pretty much unconcerned with outcomes–again, be those outcomes the creation of leaders in business and politics, or the inculcation of “character.” In his college search, our son kept saying that most elite colleges seemed to see it as their goal “to make the world a better place” (echoing the tagline of the series “Silicon Valley”). Again, that goal might be laudable, but it is really unrelated to the purpose of higher education, which is the acquisition and pursuit of knowledge–however much that acquisition and pursuit might ultimately contribute to that 'Silicon Valley\" goal. Certainly, many graduates of the College of UChicago have made and will make the world a better place. Others have pursued and will pursue pure scholarship with no worldly application; others have pursued and will pursue social justice; others might pursue revolution–or reaction. Most graduates, of course, have made and will make little or no impact on the wider world–but their minds and therefore their lives have been and will be immeasurably enriched by the demanding training that their UChicago education gave them. This isn’t to suggest that a great undergraduate education cannot be pursued at Chicago’s peer institutions. But because those institutions define their purposes so expansively and so extracurricularly, those purposes (which crucially of course include the supposed enrichment that accompanies the recruitment and fielding of 30 or so D1 athletic teams) can and will work at cross purposes with the academic and intellectual pursuit that defines UChicago’s traditional mission.\n\nDo some of the changes at UChicago threaten that traditional mission? I’ll leave it to others on this forum, who are far more familiar with the past and present UChicago, to debate and decide that question. It seems to me that the answer is “yes, probably.” I, for one, I’m concerned about the apparent intensification of interest in attracting more and better athletes. And while the College’s efforts to secure better jobs for its graduates is commendable, I’m concerned that that those efforts might inculcate a pre-professional ethos on campus. (Also, a lot of the trends in academe, itself, seem to me hostile to the University of Chicago’s traditional mission. I’m less than thrilled with a lot of the upper-level course offerings in the humanities, especially in English, which seem to be academically trendy and to be striving to be relevant to contemporary, and ephemeral, concerns.)\n\nBut I also know that so many of the changes at UChicago are laudatory. Our son, for one, was certainly not interested in attending an urban university that could not guarantee four years of campus housing. In the ancient days of my own college search, the U of C seemed in some ways ideal–but it also seemed unnecessarily grim. More important, given the then pretty wide disparity between the median SAT scores of students at UChicago compared to those at HYP, I had a sense (echoed by at least one contributor to this forum) that not all of UChicago’s students were of top academic quality. To the extent that my sense was correct, the situation is now completely different. (I should add that in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the median SAT scores at Stanford, which had not yet fully emerged as the world-class university that is today, were also significantly below those of HYP).\n\nHappy New Year everybody! I think I can add some perspective here as well. I picked UChicago and applied ED (made it!) giving up what some would characterize as a coveted legacy hook at Harvard. We have had many discussions in my family about college and while we recognized that the Harvard brand name is very strong, both my Dad and I did not feel that it was the right place for undergrad for a person with my interests. I primarily wanted a well rounded academic experience, which while possible at Harvard takes quite a lot of planning, since the institution itself is not as focused as UChicago on providing a well grounded broad based undergraduate education to its students. This is quite evident from the structure of their curriculum and requirements for graduation and the rigor of their general education requirements\n\nI specially wanted to explore American history, economics and theater arts (my fantasy of what it takes to be a more informed American citizen) while getting a degree and felt that I could achieve this better at Chicago with its core curriculum and options for majors, minors and electives than I could at Harvard.\n\nMy family is also not a big fan of where Harvard’s administration has taken the College in terms of staying true to its motto of “Veritas”. I will just leave it at that I felt that UChicago’s motto kind of sang to me and I felt that today’s Chicago fulfills its motto more authentically than Harvard does.\n\nI also have this streak in me to just do things a little bit differently, so when all my friends just assumed that I would be heading to Harvard by cashing in my legacy card, I was a little turned off by that presumption.\n\nHaving said all that, I think any dedicated student can get a great education at any of these institutions and it is a blessing to be living in a country with so many wonderful choices.\n\nClarification: Marlowe1 writes:\n\n“You and your son reached contrary conclusions after conducting a careful review of an array of elite schools.”\n\nIn some ways I loved being an undergraduate at Yale–and, because I met my spouse there, I would never trade having gone there. But not a week went by when I did not think that Chicago (or Columbia) would have been a better choice. Yalies were incredibly smart, accomplished, and ambitious, but with very, very few exceptions intellectual and academic discussion stopped at the exit to the lecture halls/seminar rooms. Good grades for law school and interview opportunities at McKinsey/Goldman dominated student concerns. This, the early Reagan years, was probably a particularly “preprofessional” era at Yale, and, although in giving talks there recently I notice that the atmosphere has greatly changed, I wouldn’t say that it’s become more intellectual (though I could be wrong).\n\nIn choosing not to apply to UChicago (I was accepted EA at Yale), my primary concern was the SAT scores. I knew and know now that the SAT is an imperfect measure of academic ability, but I found the disparities between Chicago and its peer colleges troubling. Again, obviously today that is most definitely not an issue. But a question arises: It seems to me that from the Hutchins era through (say) the early-mid-1970s Chicago attracted, and was known to attract, the most intellectual students in the country. That reputation obviously became self-fulfilling, and that Chicago didn’t restrict the number of Jews probably helped a lot (as did its stalwart commitment to free expression, which meant that it was a home to really smart left-wingers). My impression is that, for a variety of reasons (including, I’d guess, the end of the quota system at HYP), the College of UChicago suffered something of a relative and absolute decline in the general intellectual caliber of its undergraduates in from the mid-1970s through the '80s. Again, to be sure, U of C was always self-selective, and a certain kind of brilliant student (one with more conviction and courage than I had) would always choose Chicago, but maybe the brand of the UChicago B.A. was somewhat tarnished in that era. I wonder if UChicago still has to counteract that legacy to an extent. After all, the gatekeepers and opinion formers in the culture and the professions would have probably been undergraduates during that brief period of U of C’s relative decline.\n\n@Mom2Melcs , I too have a hunch, though I was not around the campus at all during those years, that the 70’s and 80’s were indeed a bad patch at the College. The heady elixir of the Hutchins era had by then been used up. Not only was there a certain loss of belief in the mission of the College within the University but the greater society had entered a hedonistic phase that did not favor the kind of UChicago seriousness and intensity that had previously appealed to a certain subset of the young. The deterioration of Hyde Park and the city of Chicago did not help. No doubt there were fumbles of the administration in marketing and improving student life. Though I hadn’t thought of this before, you are probably right in speculating that Chicago had perhaps lost a certain advantage it had previously enjoyed in attracting highly intelligent kids when the ivy league schools lifted their quotas, went co-ed and generally entered a more meritocratic era. There were feedback loops among all these factors, and the result may well have been a diminution of the appeal of the College and hence of the caliber and focus of the student body. How all that began to change in the nineties is another story, often told on this board and canonized in Dean Boyer’s history.\n\n@TheVulcan , you take us back to a memorable thread from yesteryear. Thanks for that. Does any other school attract debates of this intensity? That is a good question in its own right. It seems that @Mom2Melcs remembered this one. If so our work here was not in vain. When I am in the middle of such debates I often wonder what visitors to this forum must make of them. Some, l assume, will be very much put off by all that intensity and even fury. I have always hoped that there would be others who would glean from them certain intangibles of culture and typology characterizing the place. Indeed I am bold enough to wonder whether these discussions contributed at all to the decisions made by you and your son, by @surelyhuman and her parents, and perhaps by others.\n\nWas hoping that Cue would weigh in on this discussion! Also, @JHS is a Yalie who sent his kids to UChicago, so hopefully he’ll show up as well.\n\nWhile we don’t know all the gritty details behind either UChicago’s or Yale’s placement stats, they seem comparable when it comes to industry placement (finance, consulting, non-profit/gov’t, education, etc.). Last time I checked, UChicago and Yale had identical stats on percentage graduating with plans in place (including grad school). So not sure exactly how UChicago will be at an effective disadvantage (if at a disadvantage at all).\n\nTotally understand @Mom2Melcs unease with some of the recent changes, since they tend to be associated with a focus on things other than the intellectual life (on most college campuses, anyway). First of all, it’s probably very difficult to assess the full impact of a change before many years have passed. For instance, Sonnenschein’s proposal to “lighten” the Core back in the 90’s was highly controversial, but 20 years later it seems downright wise. So we probably won’t understand how the wisdom of implementing ED or TO - or how beefing up D3 athletics or career services - truly impacts outcomes till long after the first classes under these changes have graduated. Second, the College has a historical standard that the intellectual life must be preserved, whatever changes may (or need to) occur. So, for instance, when they decided to expand, they had to figure out how to do it in a way that increased academic strength! Third, UChicago is the Avis to HYP’s Hertz (so they have to try harder, for those who weren’t born yet or don’t remember the old ad campaign). The College has ‘em beat on curriculum, so they choose to focus on how they are “as good” at the other stuff. Some of that effort is brand building after so many decades of neglect, some is probably a deliberate and public reversal of old attitudes, and some is probably just plain ole’ competition. Fortunately, they can only do so much with D3 athletics, and the beefed-up career advancement not only risks a preprofessional ethos, but it also assures those wanting to attend the College for its intellectual culture - as well as their parents! - that they needn’t sacrifice a top career in order to do so. In other words, these other things that can improve college life have been introduced as an enhancement to, rather than a substitute for, UChicago’s academic mission. Also - no way around it - for the most part at UChicago you have to go to class.\n\nGiven that SAT scores actually rose once they instituted ED, there’s no evidence that they make any such accommodation. There IS plenty of evidence that they have passed over perfect stats and stellar accomplishments in the ED round for applicants who apparently had something else that impressed the admissions committee.\n\nThe “conventional wisdom” on ED is that universities will happily compromise on the quality of the class a bit in order to get a binding commitment. From what I’ve observed over the past few years, this “rule” no longer applies at the top. If the ED pools are as academically strong as regular round, then schools can be choosy and use “holistic” admissions to build the kind of class they wish to even among those signalling “demonstrated interest” with their ED agreement. Perhaps the “Why Us” essay becomes a crucial factor at this point to reveal “demonstrated fit.”\n\nInteresting and perhaps revelatory comment. Some of my “stemmiest” friends from HS (one of whom was admitted to Stanford, Cal-Berkeley and Cal Tech to study physics) were totally into philosophy. My husband (UChicago PhD in Economics) loved studying philosophy in HS and college. My older brother (PhD MIT) received another doctorate on the subject. My nephew double majored in philosophy and CS at a T20. And my son, who was thinking social sciences when arriving at UChicago this fall, has shifted course after one quarter of Hum and Sosc and is considering philosophy for his major. Not one of these individuals has had or would have any difficulty making a living, probably because they are all smart and the world tends to enjoy employing smart people. The other thing they have in common is a strong attraction to the humanities and to a liberal arts curriculum. I strongly suspect that brilliant stemmy kids who geek out on philosophy stand a fairly strong chance of demonstrating excellent fit at the University of Chicago.\n\nBoth MIT and Cal Tech have several options for those interested in pursuing philosophy as a course of study (be it a few courses or a concentration of some kind).
