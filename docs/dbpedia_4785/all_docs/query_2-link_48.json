        "text": "Introduction\n\n2024 versus 2021: What has been changing?\n\nAdmissions: What does MIT Sloan seek?\n\nAdmissions: What does Berkeley Haas seek?\n\nApplication Essays, Tips & Candidate Evaluation\n\nAdmissions Stats, Demographics & Class Size\n\nJobs, Pay, and Employment Location\n\nHistorical and Current Rankings\n\nGeography\n\nCulture\n\nProgram Options\n\nFacilities\n\nTeaching Methods\n\nProgram Innovation\n\nIntroduction\n\nThese two MBA programs are on opposite sides of the country. Yet, there are similarities between MIT and Haas that we evaluate here, along with admissions insights. For this smackdown series, we worked closely with the former MIT Sloan and Berkeley Haas Admissions Officers on our Stacy Blackman Consulting team. We also reviewed this smackdown with Executive Directors and Admissions Officers at both programs and incorporated their insights, perspectives and advice.\n\nMIT Sloan and Berkeley Haas are both highly selective business schools. Much of that has to do with the quality of these two institutions and their highly desirable locations. Both programs are relatively small business schools that prioritize student culture and innovation.\n\nBerkeley Haas outwardly states, “We believe that a fundamental step in redefining the business leader is to get our culture right, because this culture encourages students to develop the mindset and behaviors of innovative leaders.” MIT Sloan’s motto is ‘Ideas Made to Matter,’ and its culture is built around inventing the future and making an impact.\n\nEmployer recruiting is also comparable. If you’re aiming for a top MBA job, either the Berkeley- or MIT Sloan-punched MBA will easily get you in the door. Most national and multinational recruiters come to the Bay Area and make two stops, Stanford and Berkeley, just as most big-time recruiters make two stops in the Boston area, at Harvard and MIT Sloan. Both programs are oriented toward the tech industry. “MIT Sloan is a mission-driven school that looks to solve the world’s problems in innovative ways,” shares Dawna Levenson, the Assistant Dean of MIT Sloan Admissions. ”Candidates are uniquely qualified to manage complexity, approaching challenges with open minds and expert skills.”\n\nPoetsandQuants wrote about their similarities:\n\nBerkeley’s proximity to Silicon Valley puts the school at the forefront of entrepreneurship, venture capital, and technology. Of all the east coast schools, MIT Sloan comes closest to the same Berkeley focus. No wonder so many apply to both schools, even though they are so far from each other.\n\nAt the same time, there are notable differences between the programs. Haas is a public institution, whereas MIT Sloan is private. Separated by some 3,000 miles, one is on the West Coast and the other is on the East Coast. MIT Sloan remains in the M7 and has better brand recognition over Haas, especially in some regions abroad. The MIT Sloan Alumni network is truly global, including over 125 regional MIT Alumni Clubs and groups around the world, 29 of which are in Asia, with overall counts at more than 147 thousand MIT alumni and more than 31 thousand MIT Sloan alumni.\n\nThe Berkeley Haas global network of alumni (44,000 strong) can be found in all 50 U.S. states, across 81 countries, and at more than 20,000 organizations. “The Berkeley brand is unsurpassed in Asia,” shared a representative of Berkeley Haas.\n\n2024 VS 2021: What has been changing?\n\nHere are the three areas that are evolving, since our last smackdown update in 2021:\n\n1) Renewed MBA curriculum focused on innovation, inclusion and sustainability for both programs, including Business of AI, with a keen focus on preparing students to lead in an AI-rich world, as well as impressive entrepreneurship programs including supercharged venture accelerators. MIT Sloan has enhanced tech-specific curriculum on VR Learning and Robotics.\n\n2) Salary for recent MBA graduates has increased by over $20,000 to about $168,000 annually, which is up from about $148,000 in 2021. Average signing bonuses have also surged to about $38,000, up from $30,000 in 2021.\n\n3) Both MIT Sloan and Berkeley Haas improved women representation with an increase of 6% for MIT Sloan (at 46% currently) and a slight increase to 41% for Berkeley Haas.\n\nAdmissions: what does MIT Sloan seek?\n\n“MIT Sloan seeks applicants who can navigate problems of progressive complexity, ability to adapt to ambiguous situations, independence of thought, humility and consideration for others. MIT Sloan looks for the exceptional in arenas such as academic, professional, civic, good citizens, great attitudes. I always sensed a special something, a spark, in the candidates I recommended for admission that set them apart — it’s a sense of self not everyone has,” shared a former Assistant MIT Sloan MBA Admissions Director who is now with the Stacy Blackman Consulting team.\n\nAssistant Dean of MIT Sloan Admissions Dawna Levenson says that “MIT Sloan looks for evidence of three main factors: academic ability to be successful in the MIT Sloan classroom, desire and ability to make an impact, and ability to work well in a team environment.” Students at MIT Sloan are engaged, creative, and encouraged to think outside the typical MBA frameworks.\n\nWe asked the former Assistant MIT Sloan MBA Admissions Director who is with the Stacy Blackman Consulting team what MIT Sloan does not want. “We didn’t love any sign of arrogance or super competitiveness.”\n\nAdmissions: what does Berkeley Haas seek?\n\nBerkeley Haas has rigorous admissions standards, and its student class has stronger GMAT and GPA performance than the MIT student class. Beyond that, “Haas is really focused on its experiential learning and its Defining Leadership Principles: Question the Status Quo, Confidence Without Attitude, Students Always and Beyond Yourself. Candidates need to know the principles and talk about why at least one of the principles resonates with the candidate,” shared a former Berkeley Haas Admissions Officer who is now on the Stacy Blackman Consulting team.\n\nWe asked the former Haas Admissions Officers on our Stacy Blackman Consulting team what Haas does not want. Their consensus was:\n\nHaas tends to get annoyed with that applicant who knows nothing about Haas or why they are applying there. Applicants need an authentic application approach and speak for themselves and not be robotic or formulaic.\n\nEric Askins, current Haas Admissions Director, adds: “Candidates should be familiar with the Defining Leadership Principles and be able to craft their narrative in a way that allows us to see how they could fit into the culture at Haas.”\n\nApplication Essays, Tips & Candidate Evaluation\n\nAdmissions requirements, inclusive of essays and interview, are very different between MIT Sloan and Berkeley Haas. Sample MIT Sloan cover letters and sample Berkeley Haas essays from successful admits are instructive to applicants.\n\nHaas’s application essay prompts have historically focused on personality and moments. For example, one of Haas’s application essay prompts is “What makes you feel alive when you are doing it, and why?” Haas MBA admissions has asked creative and open-ended questions for many years. This essay is a new version of that style. Berkeley Haas looks for candidates who align with its Defining Leadership Principles. As a result of this approach, MBA students form a tight-knit community and friendships for life. The culture is one of making a positive impact, powered by the innovation culture of the San Francisco Bay Area innovation economy.\n\nFor the Haas creative essay, the former Haas Admissions Officers on the Stacy Blackman Consulting team recommends thinking about what you lose time pursuing or find completely absorbing. This likely includes your hobbies, sports, or artistic pursuits. After you have identified a meaningful activity, then you need to describe why. The “why” is more important than the “what” because it reveals something about who you are.\n\nBy contrast, MIT Sloan takes a different approach in its application. MIT Sloan currently requires all applicants to submit a cover letter, organizational chart, and video essay with their application. The MIT Sloan cover letter format has been used for many years to evaluate candidates. In some ways, this structure reflects MIT Sloan’s goal to admit candidates with practical (though innovative) ideas and experience. Also, the cover letter is a way to describe your key accomplishments and use them to prove that you embody the outlined criteria for admission. Those criteria are: independent, authentic, and fearlessly creative — true doers.\n\nFor the short video in which the applicant is asked to introduce him or herself, the areas evaluated include presence, passions, and interests. The former Sloan admissions official who now consults with MBA candidates for the Stacy Blackman Consulting team advises, “The video should give MIT Sloan Admissions a clear picture of who they are as a person, their personality, personal presence, and what really makes them tick. MIT Sloan Admissions is asking themselves: Is this person ready to be put in front of recruiters? Will they represent the brand well? Is this someone we want on our teams? Be your best self, bring some energy to it, show your enthusiasm.”\n\nThe interview process is also different between the two programs. MIT Sloan has a traditional interview but it is very behavioral, with questions that may include how to deal with conflict, how to challenge management, how to become a leader in tough circumstances etc. All who are invited for an interview by MIT Sloan are required to submit two additional essays 24 hours prior to their scheduled interview. Haas’s interviews are usually conducted by second-year students, who are looking for a fit with the program. Questions about particular classes and clubs, a resume review, and post-MBA goals are typical interview topics at Haas.\n\nAdmissions Stats, Demographics & Class Size\n\nMIT is slightly more selective than Haas, with acceptance rates hovering well under 20% for both programs. These admit rates are lower than even Kellogg and Booth. In the last decade, we have seen an uptick in the average GMAT scores by about 5 to 10 points for both programs.\n\nClass of 2025 Admission Stats MIT Sloan Berkeley Median GMAT* 730 730 GMAT Range* 700-760 690-760 Average GPA 3.61 3.65 Selectivity* NA 17.70% Yield* NA 45%\n\n*GMAT scores are based on the Classic edition, which has been replaced by a new score range for the next application cycle. Selectivity rates are estimated.\n\nIn Fall 2020, Haas experienced a larger drop in international enrollment, from an average of 33% over the past 10 years to just 21%. Peter Johnson, assistant dean of Haas’s full time MBA program, said this drop was due to visa and travel challenges posed by the COVID pandemic. He added that interest from international applicants has been very strong and that the school expects international enrollment to return to a normal range by Fall 2021. Minority representation remains difficult to compare due to varying classification criteria.\n\n“Diversity, equity, and inclusion is one of Haas Dean Ann Harrison’s top three priorities and much has been done to diversify the applicant pool. Haas began publishing its strategic diversity plan in 2018, which it regularly updates on its website. Goals include raising $20 million over the next five years to support DEI student scholarships,” shared a representative of Berkeley Haas.\n\nMIT Sloan matriculates a diverse class each year, averaging 40% international students and 46% women (up from 40% women in 2021). The community includes a vibrant collection of affinity clubs ranging from the Black Business Students Association to SWIM (Sloan Women in Management), FLI (FIrst Gen/Low Income), Hispanic Business Club, the Asian American Alliance, Sloan Vets and Sloan Pride. The community regularly invites conversation and deeper understanding of diverse identities through a popular Ask Me Anything series and The Yarn, where students share stories of resilience, pain, and joy from their lives.\n\nAt MIT Sloan, beginning with orientation, leadership and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) topics and ethics are woven throughout the entire student experience. One of MIT Sloan’s goals is to have graduates leave campus equipped with field-tested leadership frameworks they can apply to make a lasting impact from any position in any organization.\n\nEnrollment Stats MIT Sloan Berkeley Total MBA Enrollment 409 502 Women 46% 41% International 40% 21% Underrepresented Minority* 28% 14%\n\n*Estimated, as a percentage of US citizens and permanent residents. Underrepresented minority data is aggregated in different ways between the programs.\n\nPoets are equal at both schools now, which can be seen via humanities education, which is comparable at 30% and 23% at MIT Sloan and Berkeley Haas, respectively. Haas had just 14% from humanities a decade ago and has increased significantly since then.\n\nThose with engineering and math/science degrees account for 45% of MIT Sloan’s students, a full 18 percentage points higher than at Berkeley Haas, which correlates with QS World University Rankings having named MIT the world’s top-ranked school in engineering and math for nine straight years, in addition to noting MIT’s spirit of collaboration between its schools, particularly in the realm of entrepreneurship.\n\nOn the other hand, Berkeley is slightly more open to enrolling business and economics undergraduates than MIT Sloan. About 39% of Berkeley’s Class of 2022 have business or economics backgrounds, versus 34% at MIT Sloan.\n\nUndergrad Degrees MIT Sloan Berkeley Humanities/Social Science 30% 23% Engineering/Math/Science 45% 27% Business/Economics 34% 39%\n\nJobs, Pay, and Employment Location\n\nMIT Sloan students in the most recent graduating class garnered an average salary of $168,095 with an average bonus of $38,989, and it’s comparable at Haas at around $163,000 average salary and $37,000 average bonus. When it comes to pay, employment rate and outcomes, both schools provide solid on-ramps to lucrative MBA jobs, as you can see from their employment reports.\n\nMIT Sloan Employment Report\n\nBerkeley Haas Employment Report\n\nKey aspects of employment are noted in the chart below. The most significant differences are in geographic location for career placement: Northeast versus West Coast, which reflects each school’s home base. If you want to work on the West Coast or Silicon Valley, Berkeley has the edge. If you want to hang out on the East Coast with access to career opportunities in Cambridge, Boston and New York, among others, MIT Sloan has an advantage. Overall, tech and consulting outplacement are similar.\n\nAt rates of 24% and 32%, respectively, MIT Sloan and Berkley Haas’ tech industry outcomes are higher than the tech outcomes of several other M7 programs (compared to HBS at 16%) and aligned with Stanford GSB’s rate into tech of 24%. Tech industry outcomes have grown by about 7% at both programs since one decade ago when it was 20% and 26% for MIT Sloan and Berkeley Haas, respectively.\n\nFinance industry outcomes at both Berkeley Haas and MIT Sloan are at 14.5% and 19.9% respectively, where we see Wharton, Booth, HBS, and CBS graduates landing in finance at a rate of 30-36%. “Haas is not known for its finance program. But any finance person applying to Haas should know that if their number one reason is because of Haas’s finance program, then they probably aren’t being honest. It could be because they want to stay in the Bay Area (or move back) and continue in finance. Regardless, if it’s finance, then they need to do some specific research about what finance courses/professors are right for them.”\n\nStill, financial services is a top-3 industry for Haas MBA grads, many who accept jobs in investment banking on the West Coast. “If you want to do investment banking, and you want to cover tech clients or other sectors from the Bay Area, then you should come to Haas,” said Bill Rindfuss, director of strategic programs in finance and member of the Career Management Group at Haas. Haas polls Bay Area investment banking offices each year and regularly reports the top aggregate number of summer associates (among business schools), the gateway to full-time investment banking jobs. With tech’s dominance in the region, many other finance roles intersect with tech, through fintech, VC, or roles in corporate finance or corporate development. Impact investing and sustainability form another intersection with finance that’s very important to Haas, through its Sustainable and Impact Finance initiative.\n\nFinance is a top-three industry for MIT Sloan each year as well. As shared with us by a MIT Sloan representative, “At MIT Sloan, Finance aligns with MIT Sloan’s areas of core expertise including FinTech and social impact investing, and it was one of the first business schools to introduce courses on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. MIT Sloan is home to the Golub Center for Finance and Policy. Finance staff includes such heavyweights as Nobel Laureate Robert Merton who pioneered the Black–Scholes–Merton model, and Finance Prof. Gary Gensler was sworn into office in April of 2021 as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. MIT Sloan’s Master of Finance (MFin) degree program is a rigorous 18-month STEM curriculum, with the option to accelerate in 12 months, MFin emphasizes a foundation in how markets work and is engineered around financial theories, quantitative models, and industry practices.”\n\nMIT Sloan has also introduced a Finance Certificate intended for both career-changers and experienced finance professionals. Students who complete the certificate are awarded a certificate in finance in addition to their degree. The Finance Certificate is an integrated program of courses and activities designed to expose students to the institutions and practices of the financial world, grounding students in the principles of finance theory and in the application of theory to real problems along with providing them with an overview of professional opportunities in finance.\n\nJobs & Pay Data MIT Sloan Berkeley Haas MBAs employed 3 months after commencement 86.90% 88.70% Consulting Industry 33.70% 25.10% Finance Industry 19.90% 14.50% Tech Industry 24.10% 32.40% Healthcare 5.80% 11.60% Northeast Location 44.70% 7.70% West Coast Location 23.70% 74.90% Southwest Location 7.20% 1.90% South 5.50% 1.00% Mid Atlantic 6.90% 1.40% Midwest 4.10% 3.90% International 7.20% 10%\n\nHistorical and Current Rankings\n\nAs rankings suggest, these schools are typically ranked in the top 10. Poets&Quants — which factors into consideration all the major rankings weighted by their individual authority — awards MIT Sloan a rank of sixth, while Berkeley is right on its heels in the eighth spot, making it our highest ranked public university business school. Similar patterns can be seen via the US News annual rankings.\n\nPoets & Quants 2024 Poets & Quants 2023 Poets & Quants 2022 US News 2024 US News 2023 US News 2022 US News 2021 MIT Sloan 14 6 6 5 5 5 4 Berkeley Haas 15 10 8 7 7 7 6\n\nGeography\n\n“Haas is the heart of what’s next, the center of the Silicon Valley innovation economy, and we lean heavily into that economy through our relationships with the top Bay Area companies and their leaders,” said Haas Dean Ann Harrison. “These deep relationships that we’ve built over the years — in areas of tech, consulting, fintech, and at startups — offer an incredibly rich variety of internship and employment opportunities for students, many who choose Haas for these unique Bay Area experiences.”\n\nFor a Haas student, studying in the heart of Silicon Valley provides access to industry lecturers, case studies, team projects for local companies, on-site company visits and more. Silicon Valley is home to technologists, innovators, life science visionaries, and venture capitalists.\n\nThe location can facilitate finding the right job for technology talents and interests. The Bay Area is a prime location for students aspiring toward international business. “California is a gateway to South American and Asian economies, and many of the world’s global companies are headquartered in the Bay Area,” shared a former Haas MBA Admissions Officer on the Stacy Blackman Consulting team.\n\nPoets&Quants wrote, “Berkeley is located in one of the most livable and desirable places in the world: Northern California. The area’s diverse geography ranges from the sandy beaches of the Pacific coast to the rugged, snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, both a mecca for those who enjoy the outdoors, whether biking, kayaking, or skiing. Berkeley is a 15-minute BART ride to San Francisco or about half an hour by car. Berkeley is the funky and eclectic west coast equivalent of Cambridge, with used bookstores, record shops that still sell vinyl, lots of cafes, and limitless purveyors of beads and bumper stickers that carry protest messages.\n\nMIT Sloan is located in the heart of Cambridge’s Kendall Square neighborhood. The school is surrounded by biotech companies, tech giants, startups, and research labs, as well as a wide array of restaurants, outdoor activities, arts, music, and culture. And with nearly 60 colleges and universities in the Boston area, creative, intellectual energy is a key part of the fabric of the city.\n\nCambridge’s neighbor, Boston, is one of the country’s intellectual, technological, and political centers. The Boston Celtics, Bruins and Red Sox all play within two miles of campus. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, the North End (Boston’s Little Italy), Chinatown, and a thriving restaurant, entertainment and cultural scene that make Boston a vibrant urban environment. Spring brings the world’s elite runners to the Boston Marathon and Fall welcomes rowers to the Head of the Charles Regatta. Steeped in history, the Freedom Trail and historical buildings and monuments spotlight the city’s leading role in the American Revolution. Cape Cod’s Sagamore and Bourne Bridges — the gateway to Massachusetts’ famed beaches and seafood culinary delights — are approximately one hour away from MIT Sloan. Ferry service to Provincetown, the funky and eclectic community at the very tip of Cape Cod, is available from Boston, while ferries to Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are easily accessible on the Cape. And the Berkshires, home to Tanglewood, arts and culture, and hiking, kayaking, and skiing is located a couple hours away in the other direction. New Hampshire’s White Mountains and Vermont’s Green Mountains are also easily accessible for hiking, skiing, and snowboarding, as are Maine mountains and coastline. Spring and summer weather is often very pleasant. And although winter months can usher in cold and snow, there isn’t anything like the fog that tends to stubbornly cling to the Bay Area for much of the year.\n\nCulture\n\nEven though the two schools are on opposite coasts, 3,000 miles away, there’s a similar vibe. Close community defines both programs and enables an environment of innovation, ideas and impact. “I advise applicants to draw their own conclusions. I ask clients to visit the schools or engage virtually to get a sense of whether one would fit in,” shared a former Haas Admissions Officer on the Stacy Blackman Consulting team. Both programs are known to be collaborative, with self-aware, well-rounded, and inspired student culture. For institutions that attract smart, already accomplished, yet still highly ambitious people, the competition among students is kept to a minimum.\n\nProgram Options\n\nThe flagship program at both schools is the full-time, two-year MBA. Both Berkeley Haas and MIT Sloan now have deferred admissions programs for college seniors.\n\nHaas’s MBA program also offers joint degree options in Public Health, Engineering, and Law, some of Berkeley’s top-ranked graduate programs. The MBA/MPH is the longest-running and most successful of the three. The MBA/JD is recently redesigned to make it more student friendly. Haas has two joint programs with the top-rated College of Engineering: the undergraduate Management, Engineering, & Technology and the MBA/MEng programs. Haas also has a part-time program (called Evening & Weekend MBA or EWMBA) and an executive, EMBA, program and the program houses the undergraduates that are part of the Haas school. Haas also has a top-ranked Master in Financial Engineering.\n\nMIT Sloan has a portfolio of degree programs to educate leaders at different stages in their professional development. MIT Sloan has an executive (EMBA) program, whose students have an average of 17 years of work experience, as well as the MIT Sloan Fellows program for mid-career professionals who, on average, have 14 years of work experience. MIT also has a dual-degree program, Leaders For Global Operations (LGO). Over the course of two years, LGO students earn both an MS from MIT’s School of Engineering and an MBA degree from Sloan. The program features internships at elite partner companies. Students can also apply concurrently to the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) and MIT Sloan to be admitted to an accelerated three-year joint degree program. There are also two pre-experience master’s programs, the 12 or 18-month MFin and the 12-month Masters in Business Analytics (MBAn).\n\nFacilities\n\nAt MIT Sloan, five core buildings make up the Sloan School on the east campus of the institute. A 250,000 square-foot building called E62 — all buildings across MIT are designated by numbers, not names — opened in 2010. E62 is a world-class, LEED Gold-certified, modern six-floor structure with new classrooms, study rooms, and a 200-seat dining hall. Interior bridges connect E62 and buildings E40, E51, E52 and E60. The recently renovated E52 was re-designed with a nod to the Art Deco style that characterized the original building. Its new Samberg Conference Center’s top two floors is a 20,000-foot glass-encased addition that looks out at the Charles River and the Boston skyline. Each of the Conference Center’s two floors can accommodate 300 guests.\n\nIn fall of 2024, a new entrepreneurship hub will open next to the Haas School. In 2017, Haas opened Chou Hall, a six-story LEED and Zero-Waste certified building nestled in redwood trees, with a top-floor event space, a street-level cafe, and balconies and outdoor meeting spaces on every floor. The campus also includes a complex of three buildings connected by bridges and surrounding a courtyard where students gather for lunch, study sessions, and social events like Consumption Functions.\n\nTeaching Methods\n\nMIT Sloan’s teaching methods are designed to suit the course: lectures, simulations, team-based projects, and case studies. MIT Sloan offers a portfolio of 15 Action Learning Lab programs that encompass the MIT motto, “mens et manus”—mind and hand, and address a wide range of interdisciplinary subjects.\n\nBerkeley estimates that case studies make up half of the classroom instruction, while team projects take up 15% of the class work. Good old-fashioned lectures, experiential learning, and simulations make up the rest.\n\nThere is no forced grading curve at MIT Sloan or at Berkeley Haas. Faculty individually decide how to grade in each class and many feel that there is significant grade inflation. MIT Sloan grades on a 5.0 point scale (students need a 4.0 to graduate).\n\nProgram Innovation\n\nMIT Sloan has a one semester core with five required classes and the option of one elective. There are no waivers, regardless of your level of experience or your background in any of the core subjects. The incoming class of approximately 415 at MIT Sloan is divided into six cohorts which are then carved into core teams that are meant to be as diverse as possible.\n\nMIT Sloan has over 90 electives in its course catalog, MIT Sloan continues to innovate in the curriculum. The MIT Leadership Center has developed a sequence of hands-on courses that focus on leadership development, starting with ID Lab, a new course that enables the pursuit of self and other-awareness in the service of improved individual, team and organizational performance. This popular class uses a mix of theory, executive coaching, reflection and peer interactions.\n\nMIT Sloan faculty are publishing a variety of research on AI, which is then also being incorporated into the content and pedagogy of core and elective courses along with opportunities for students where AI doesn’t just assist, but participates. For example, MIT Sloan students can experience the world of AI-augmented negotiation, where professor Jared Curhan blends research-backed teaching techniques with the precision of AI to shape the negotiators of the future. Also this term, one of the most popular MBA classes, Generative AI for Managers, was taught by professor John Horton and focused on preparing students to lead in an AI-rich world. Other new AI-focused courses of note include:\n\nGlobal Business of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, which examines applications of artificial intelligence and robotics in the business world and emphasizes understanding the likely direction of technology and how it is likely to be used.\n\nArtificial Intelligence for Business, which explores how to design and evaluate products and policy based on artificial intelligence. Provides a functional (as opposed to mechanistic) understanding of the emerging technologies underlying AI presents AI’s opportunities and risks, and how to create conditions under which its deployment can succeed.\n\nAnalytics Lab: Action Learning Seminar on Analytics, Machine Learning, and the Digital Economy in which student teams design and deliver a project based on the use of analytics, machine learning, large data sets, or other digital innovations to create or transform a business or other organization. Teams pair up with an organization or propose their own ideas and sites for the project.\n\nMIT Sloan students can enroll in certificate programs in Business Analytics, Enterprise Management, Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Finance, Healthcare Systems,Product Management, and Sustainability. Each certificate includes an action learning component for students to practice in teams what they have learned in a real environment. Some examples include PM Lab, Healthcare Lab, Analytics Lab, the EM Hackathon, and the Silicon Valley trek.\n\nMIT Sloan offers dozens of courses in entrepreneurship to choose from; the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship is located on Sloan’s campus, serving as the nexus of MIT’s entrepreneurship ecosystem. The Trust Center has multiple Entrepreneurs-in-Residence and a professional advisors network to mentor MBAs interested in launching their startups. The Center itself was remodeled and expanded in 2016 to better accommodate startups on campus and host larger events centered on entrepreneurship along with introducing its Protoworks makerspace, where students are able to explore and experiment on their entrepreneurial ideas through initial physical prototyping.\n\nThe Trust Center is also home to delta v, MIT’s student venture accelerator, which provides a hands-on, capstone educational opportunity in both Cambridge and NYC for student entrepreneurs, teaching them the craft of entrepreneurship. Since its inception, 61% of delta v projects have become real companies that either continue to exist to this day or have been acquired. Since its debut as the MIT $10K Entrepreneurship Competition in 1989, the MIT $100K Competition has grown to include three independent contests – Pitch, Accelerate, and Launch – from September through May. Each contest focuses on developing specific founding skills. For each semi-finalist contender, the MIT $100K brings together a network of resources that includes mentorship from venture capitalists, serial entrepreneurs, corporate executives, and attorneys; media exposure; prototyping funds; business plan feedback; and discounted services. Altogether, almost $1M in non-dilutive prize money and other financial resources are awarded to help these new ventures accelerate.\n\nAt Haas, the incoming class of just 296 students is divided into four cohorts of 74 students each who go through the core classes together as well. Haas has recently beefed up its offerings in its three priority areas — innovation, inclusion, and sustainability — by adding a new certificate in business sustainability, courses in carbon footprinting, and CSR metrics. As part of a recent core curriculum reform Haas is enhancing training in business communications and persuasion skills, doubling coursework in statistics and data analytics, and creating a new course on leading diverse teams — likely a first for any leading business school in the United States and consistent with the school’s focus on diversity and inclusion.\n\nBerkeley Haas is only 30 miles away from Silicon Valley, and Haas over a dozen electives in entrepreneurship: “Opportunity Recognition–Technology and Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley,” “Entrepreneurship Workshop for Startups,” “Business Model Innovation in New Ventures,” and “New Venture Finance.”\n\n“Haas was among the first — if not the first — business school to teach entrepreneurship 50 years ago,” shared a representative of Haas’s MBA program. He added, “About 20% of MBA graduates in the most recent class sought to work for startups or start a company. The Berkeley Haas Entrepreneurship Program supports students’ journeys with programs like LAUNCH, which leads about 40% of student startups to incubators and accelerators, the most common path to preparing a company for seed funding.” Haas offers over a dozen electives in entrepreneurship: “Opportunity Recognition–Technology and Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley,” “Entrepreneurship Workshop for Startups,” “Business Model Innovation in New Ventures,” and “New Venture Finance.”\n\nCheck out our other MBA program smackdowns at the links below:\n\nHarvard versus Stanford\n\nColumbia versus Wharton\n\nINSEAD versus LBS\n\nKellogg versus Booth\n\nDuke versus Darde"
