None of this was meant very seriously, of course; yet I was clearly onto a topic that—unlike, say, the Roman grammarians of late antiquity—had some resonance with other people’s experience. And, in fact, I had stumbled onto it as an offshoot of my own experience. It was an experience that, all things considered, I would gladly have forgone, or so I felt at the time. In 1996, when I was president of the American Philological Association, it happened that some members of the Association, a faction, really, behaved in ways I thought shameful, and I wanted to acknowledge the fact in the presidential address that I was required to deliver at the year’s end. Because I could not refer to the behavior directly, for a range of reasons, I hit upon the idea of talking about the Roman version of shame: I could thereby meet the obligations of the occasion—by custom, part scholarly lecture, part protreptic address—and at the same time allude to the events that had inspired me.1 I thought that I succeeded, in so far as several people who had reason to know what I was talking about indicated that they knew what I was talking about; and in any case I came to see that the Roman versions of shame and some other familiar emotions opened a fascinating prospect for further investigation. A fair amount of time has passed since then, not all of it spent in the pleasures of research. But that, as I’ve come to see, has been all to the good; for this has proved to be the sort of project that needed time, for my own thoughts to come into focus and for me to gain at least a working knowledge of contemporary approaches to the study of the emotions in other fields, where there has been an explosion of interest in the past twenty to thirty years. Within the field of Classics, too, there has been a serendipitous convergence of interests such that only a crystal ball could have foreseen in 1996: the major works on\n\nPREFACE\n\n“ancient emotions” then available—I think primarily of Cairns 1993 (on aidôs in Greek thought and literature), Barton 1993 (on the place of “despair” and “envy” in Roman imperial culture), and Nussbaum 1994 (on the “therapy of desire” in Hellenistic philsophy)—have since been joined by the those of Cooper (1999), Sorabji (2000), Barton, Harris, Konstan, and Nussbaum (all 2001), Graver (2002), and Toohey (2004), to mention only book-length studies, as well as the collective volumes edited by Braund and Gill (1997), Sihvola and Engberg-Pedersen (1998), Konstan and Rutter (2003), and Braund and Most (2003). As a result, my initial study of “the shame of Romans,” which I described at the time as “a very preliminary sort of sketch,” has proved to be far more preliminary—not to say, inadequate—than I expected, as the project has taken me in rewarding directions I did not imagine when it began and taught me far more about emotions, and the relations between emotions and language, than I could have anticipated. The book was begun at Chicago and completed at Princeton, the yin and yang of great universities: to have been associated with both seems more good fortune than any one person deserves. From the beginning to the end my work has been supported by several other splendid institutions: at Oriel College, Oxford, where I spent a term as a visiting fellow on leave from Princeton, in 1999, I first began to see the shape that the book would have to take, and it is a pleasure to thank once again the Provost and Fellows of the College, and especially Chris Kraus, for the privilege of being among them; then, in 2003–2004, another semester’s leave from Princeton and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities allowed me to put the pieces together at the Institute for Advanced Study, where—thanks above all to Glen Bowersock and Heinrich von Staden—I enjoyed a sublimely intense year as a visitor. Less directly, the Packard Humanities Institute has also been responsible for making this book possible— or, at least, possible sooner—for without its CD-ROM #5.3 I would not have completed the basic research until I was far into my dotage. And once again, the good people at Oxford University Press—especially Elissa Morris and Keith Faivre—have provided all the support an author could want. Earlier versions of chapters 4 and 5 were published, respectively, in Envy, Spite, and Jealousy: The Rivalrous Emotions in Ancient Greece (Edinburgh: University of Edinburgh Press, 2003) and Transactions of the American Philological Association 113 (2001): my thanks to David Konstan and Keith Rutter for organizing the conference that provoked the former and to Cynthia Damon for her exemplary work as editor in seeing the latter into print. Another stimulating conference on the emotions, organized by Ruth Caston at the University of California at Davis in May 2003, caused me to write the initial version of chapter 3; and all of the preceding, in various forms, together with early drafts of chapters 1 and 6, were tried out on audiences at Brown, Bryn Mawr, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, CUNY, Fordham, Johns Hopkins, Penn, Oxford, and Yale: I’m grateful to colleagues on all these occasions for their conversaviii\n\nPREFACE\n\ntion, correction, and encouragement. At different stages, Matt Roller and Jaap Wisse gave me helpful readings of chapter 5, as did Tony Long and Michael Nylan of chapter 6; and Rebecca Langlands kindly let me see some of her work on pudicitia in advance of publication. And I received much good advice— more, I know, than I took—from friendly critics who read all or most of a completed draft: Ruth Caston, Joy Connolly, Margaret Graver, Laura Kaster, David Konstan, Martha Nussbaum, and Peter White. Thanks to Peter’s good sense, too, I also came to realize when it was time to stop. Finally: this book is dedicated to Laura, my wife now of thirty-five years, for more reasons than I can say. But here are three: because she did not let me use a colon in the title; because she persuaded me some years ago to write as though I were talking with her—which is to say, with a generous, honest, and intelligent friend; and because—though I have been lucky enough to know many good people—she is the best.

[But now] because of our faults . . . we maintain our community in name only, having lost it in fact long ago. The race of Saturn was a just race, not because of coercion or laws but of its own accord, and it knew restraint from the ways of the ancient deity. Not yet had human wickedness put Justice to flight (she was the last of The Ones Above to leave the earth), and in place of fear the very sense of shame kept the people in line, without force. Nor was there need for rewards when honorable ends were by their very nature sought; and since people desired nothing contrary to established custom, they were forbidden nothing through fear of punishment. But after the principle of equality was stripped away, and ambition and force strode about in place of restraint and shame, forms of lordly power arose, and they remained, among many nations, forever.1\n\nThe ancients once knew paradise, and they threw it away for the sake of trash. Or so went the story the Romans told themselves, time and again, in various forms: how an easy and unforced virtue allowed a cooperative community of just, pious, and rugged equals to flourish, content with little, and how that community fell from virtue, as though from grace, to compete for dominion, to cultivate factions and division, and to need the curb of law.2 Different versions of the story put the fall at different times and attribute it to different proximate causes, but on two key points they all agree. The flaw was not an appetite for too much knowledge, as it was in Eden, but an appetite for just too much—too much wealth, too much luxury, too much power, too much “me, ME, ME.” And the source of the flaw lay not with a Tempter but in themselves. 3\n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nNow, we can be pretty certain that these stories tell us less about some Edenic reality in the Roman past than they do about the values and yearnings of the story-tellers as they faced their grubby present. But the stories do raise an interesting question: what is the psychology of paradise? If people act rightly, in accordance with seemingly self-chosen norms, without the threat of force or law, why do they do that, and what is going on in their minds when they do? Put in the latter form especially, the question gains some historical traction, because it is plain that—like many if not most people today—many if not most Romans did behave that way at least a fair amount of the time. In that respect, the psychology of paradise does bear on human lives as they are lived in real time, and it has some bearing, too, on how we understand the Romans and their culture. So this book is an expedition in cultural psychology: its primary goal, broadly stated, is to understand at least some of the interplay between the emotions and the ethics of the Roman upper classes (roughly, the male members of the senatorial and equestrian orders and their families) in the late Republic and early Empire. The focus falls on the often unreflecting and unarticulated ways in which people adopt norms as they grow up in a culture and the ways in which emotions, and talk about emotions, reinforce those norms. The more specific questions before us are these: how (in the Roman view) is virtuous behavior shaped by the emotions, especially those stirred by self-consciousness and the regard of (and for) others? how in particular do various Roman forms of fear, dismay, indignation, and revulsion support or constrain different sorts of ethically significant behavior? what are the specific domains of the several emotions on which we will concentrate, and how do they intersect, overlap, or complement one another? and how does their interaction create an economy of displeasure, a system that causes negative feelings to circulate in constructive ways?3 In short, our expedition has as its quarry a cluster of bad vibes, of a particular sort—not those that move me to lash out, to take vengeance by wounding or annihilating some offending other (feelings of “anger,” “hatred,” or the like), but those of a generally quieter, socially useful strain that, by exerting a normative pressure, aim to prevent or correct the offense: by giving off these vibes, or by turning them upon myself, I do my bit to realize the peaceful, unified, and righteous community of the folktale. In our search, we first examine two emotions that mobilize self-consciousness in ways that are closely related yet distinct: these are the emotions to which the labels verecundia and pudor (roughly, worried regard or respect and shame) are usually attached. We then consider the emotion usually labeled paenitentia (roughly, regret) that focuses displeasure on—among other things—my own shortcomings, followed by two emotions that focus displeasure on—among other things—the shortcomings of others, one of them a form of hostility, the other a form of revulsion (the emotions usually labeled invidia and fastidium, respectively). A brief 4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nepilogue then offers some reflections on what Romans of the elite meant when they spoke of being ethically whole (integer) or of possessing the virtue of ethical wholeness (integritas): as we will see, the virtue—though rather different from the modern virtue of integrity to which it gives a name—is not unrelated either to the emotions that are the book’s main subject or to the paradise of a stable community. Now, the questions noted here are certainly not the only questions that could be asked about the links between Roman emotions and Roman ethics, and the emotions we examine are certainly not the only sort that work to preserve community (various Roman forms of love and pity, to name only the most obvious, play a crucial role, as well);4 but those questions, and the emotions tested by them, seemed sufficient for this one book. And, because the book asks such questions, it necessarily takes on board another large set of issues that provide a second major theme, involving questions of method. I hinted at these issues in speaking of “various Roman forms” of feelings to which we and the Romans customarily attach certain (different) labels: I intended there to suggest not only that Roman and English emotion-labels differ in their coverage and application but also that emotions and the labels that get attached to them are in important ways distinct. Let me bring these issues into focus now by way of two anecdotes. Late in the pages of Apuleius’s Metamorphoses, an upright young man finds himself in a terrible fix (10. 2–12). Having rejected the advances of his stepmother, a latter-day Phaedra, he is soon faced with a murder charge; for when the stepmother’s biological son dies after intercepting a poisoned potion she intended for the stepson, the woman and a conniving slave frame the young man for the crime. On their telling of the story, it was the youth who made a pass at his stepmother and, angered by her response, took vengeance by poisoning the boy. This is the version that the slave perjuriously recounts in his testimony at the young man’s trial, as the story builds to its climax (10. 7): Made indignant by his stepmother’s fastidium, the young man had summoned [the slave] and, seeking vengeance for the insult (iniuria), had ordered him to murder her son, first offering a generous reward for his silence, then threatening him with death when he refused. The young man mixed the poison himself and gave it to [the slave] to administer; but when he came to suspect that [the slave] had neglected his office and had kept the cup as evidence for a criminal charge, he finally gave the boy the poison with his own hands.\n\nThe lying tale is awash in emotions, expressed and implied—the youth’s indignation and desire for revenge, prompting his cajolements, angry threats, and fearful suspicions—but it starts from an emotion attributed to the stepmother, her fastidium: what, exactly, should the tale’s audiences (we as read5\n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\ners and, within the story, the jury) understand that she felt? How does that feeling fit into the transaction at the story’s center? And how do we know? Or, consider another story charged with strong feelings, this time an incident witnessed by the moralist Valerius Maximus on the island of Ceos while traveling with Sextus Pompeius, a governor of Asia under the emperor Tiberius in the first part of the first century CE.5 In one of the island’s towns, a very old and very distinguished lady had decided that it was time to die; following the local custom, she proposed to do so in public, by taking poison, having first given an account of her reasons to her fellow-citizens.6 Because she “thought it very important that her death be made more distinguished by Pompeius’s presence” (“mortem . . . suam Pompei praesentia clariorem fieri magni aestimaret”), she begged him to attend, and being a man of perfect humanitas, Pompeius did just that, first attempting to dissuade her from suicide, then respecting her resolve and allowing her to proceed. And so, arrayed in finery on a litter, she gratefully blessed Pompeius—“May the gods repay you because you did not feel fastidium at (the thought of) either urging me to live or watching me die” (“. . . quod nec hortator vitae meae nec mortis spectator esse fastidisti”)—then said her farewells to her family, took the poison with a steady hand, and reported its effects as it passed through her body, until her daughters performed the final duty of closing her eyes. Pompeius and Valerius left the scene stunned and deeply moved (“nostros [sc. oculos] . . . , tametsi novo spectaculo obstupefacti erant, suffusos tamen lacrimis dimisit”). But what, exactly, was the emotion—the fastidium—that the woman blessed Pompeius for not feeling? How (again) does that feeling fit into the transaction at the story’s center? And how do we know? I put the question concerning the fastidium common to these two stories— which (a dash of suspense now) we will revisit near the end of this book—as a way of posing a larger question: how can we understand, as fully and authentically as possible, the emotion-talk of another culture removed in time in a way that does not entail either simplification—by reducing the emotion to a convenient lexical package in our own language—or projection—by answering the question according to the emotion we might feel (whoever “we” might be) in the same circumstance? This question, of course, incorporates the question how one can appropriately translate a given emotion-term in a given setting (“scorn,” for example, would be a reasonable, if oversimplifying, choice in both examples);7 but it is broader than and distinct from just the concerns of lexical correspondence. Presenting one possible answer to this question is the second of this book’s main goals.8 We can start from the fact that the Romans’ language of emotions is not our own, that indeed no two emotion terms in either language map perfectly onto each other: their amor is not always and exactly our “love,” their odium still less our “hate.”9 Of course, we can and must try to flesh out the lexical correspondences with appropriate supplements and nuances: we have only the 6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRomans’ words (complemented occasionally by images), and the words must be our starting point. But an understanding that remained at the level of lexical correspondence would not be sufficient. Take the case of the emotion-term that figures in the examples, fastidium, the Latin word that most closely approximates the English term “disgust.” In its most basic and straightforward application—for example, when used of creatures not burdened with selfawareness—the word denotes a feeling or reaction of aversion: so fastidium cibi, which can most aptly be translated as “aversion for food,” is the expression used dozens of times by agricultural writers to describe the state or behavior of farm animals that go off their feed and by medical writers to describe the feeling of people who become ill and do not wish to eat.10 “Aversion for food” is the first meaning that you will find given for the word in the Oxford Latin Dictionary, and that is right and fine as far as it goes. It does not, however, go very far, especially for the settings of greatest interest to most readers of classical Latin texts, where not only self-awareness but self-awareness deployed in personal and social interaction is crucial. Those are the contexts in which the dictionary’s subentries branch out into disgust, contempt, fastidiousness, and a variety of other labels that all clearly converge on the idea of “aversion” but yet are significantly different from one another. How to understand that difference? And how to understand that that difference is a difference that exists only in English, because these meanings are all, in Latin, fastidium?11 We could, in effect, repeat the work of the lexica, reviewing the word’s occurrences instance by instance—inquiring whether fastidium in a given case is disgust, or some milder form of aversion, or perhaps contempt, or scorn, and so on—in an attempt to devise criteria for making such distinctions. But the attempt (which I have made) would only lead us to realize that the process is, if not merely futile, then at least unsatisfactory. First, there is often little reason to think that one’s own sorting would match that of other Englishspeakers (to say nothing of French-speakers, German-speakers, . . . ), not just because there are very frequently insufficient clues in a given context to provide a sound basis for one’s own sorting but especially because it is highly likely that no two English-speakers (et al.) will sort aversion vs. disgust vs. contempt vs. scorn in quite the same way. (Numerous conversations on the point leave me in no doubt of this.)12 More important, such an approach only tends to replicate the impression conveyed by the lexica, that in any given place fastidium can mean only one of those sorted senses, that it just is disgust but not disdain or choosiness at the same time. (This is certainly false.)13 Finally, and most important, the approach does not even touch the core problem: while my version of English might do its sorting this way and that, the Romans expressed no difference, no explicit sorting of any kind. It was all fastidium to them. We can take this last fact, then, to suggest that the Romans mapped this corner of their emotional terrain differently, including under the single heading fastidium a cluster of affective experiences that we (English-speakers) 7\n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\ncurrently distinguish by a variety of terms, and the different sort of mapping that fastidium accomplishes will be a recurrent feature, in one way or another, of all the other emotion-talk that will engage us. (The divergent mappings of Latin and English are of course not limited to emotion terms.) To explore this fact, then, I propose that we suspend concern with lexical meaning or equivalence and instead think about all such talk just as the end-product of a process that engages body and mind together: any emotion-term is just the lexicalized residue of what happens when the data of life are processed in a particular way—through a sequence of perception (sensing, imagining), evaluation (believing, judging, desiring), and response (bodily, affective, pragmatic, expressive)—to produce a particular kind of emotionalized consciousness, a particular set of thoughts and feelings.14 Let me elaborate briefly some elements of this proposal with reference to the sort of experience central to this book: the conscious experience of an occurrent emotion.15 By “lexicalized residue” I mean that if you are a Roman monitoring your emotions, you will register the playing out of this process by saying (for example) “hui! fastidium!” Typically, you will also link this registering closely with the last stage of the process, the response, and in particular a bodily response (say, gagging and/or nausea), or an affective response (say, upset and/or disdain), or a pragmatic response (say, an actual turning away), or some combination of these. The emotion properly understood, however, is the whole process and all its constituent elements, the little narrative or dramatic script that is acted out from the evaluative perception at its beginning to the various possible responses at the end. Subtract any element of the script, and the experience is fundamentally altered: without a response (even one instantly rejected or suppressed), there is only dispassionate evaluation of phenomena; without an evaluation (even one that does not register consciously), there is a mere seizure of mind and body that is about nothing at all.16 There are at least two advantages in approaching emotions in terms of narrative processes or scripts. First—and as others have seen before me—it allows us to think and talk about emotions in language that does not itself rely on emotion-talk: we can thus more directly get at what a given form of emotion is about without becoming embroiled in the tedious regress of defining emotion-terms via other emotion-terms that in turn need definition.17 Second, the method is consistent with current thought on the nature of emotions, as it has developed over a range of disciplines in the past generation. In that time, cognition, the way we acquire knowledge and form judgments and beliefs based on our perceptions and memories, has been returned to a place in the spotlight—the place that it enjoyed in (for example) Stoic thought on emotions in antiquity—after it had been upstaged by evolutionary biology’s concept of “hard-wired” emotions (innate responses acquired as genetically favored forms of adaptation) and by behavioral psychology’s stress on the measurable elements of stimulus and response. (Cognitions cannot easily be quantified to produce 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndata subject to a chi-square test.) Though there is still a range of opinion on the relation between, and the relative importance of, basic neurological structures and developmental biology (on the one hand) and the construction of emotions through education and socialization (on the other), it is uncontroversial that emotion’s cognitive content is especially important in identifying the emotion that a person experiences, or is likely to experience, in a given setting, and in understanding why that emotion is matched with that setting.18 Most important for the present project, returning the spotlight to cognition means that culture too—with its role in shaping judgments and beliefs and in giving us the emotion-talk by which we make our experiences intelligible—has regained a central place in the little drama that must be grasped as a whole. This holistic approach, which conceives of any given emotion as “the unitary experience of the whole package deal”—from presentation of a phenomenon through evaluation to response—provides one of this book’s cornerstones.19 But—to return to the subject of emotion-talk—it is also true that “package deals” of somewhat different shapes and contents can have the same label attached to them, and in this respect many emotion-terms in both Latin and English behave alike. For example, the amor experienced by erotically engaged partners and the amor experienced by parents for children converged, for the Romans, on a cluster of responses (thoughts and feelings having to do with attachment, concern, and the like) that were sufficiently homogeneous to attract the the same label; similarly (but in English), my reaction to having a really great dinner and my reaction to having a good idea can comfortably accept the same emotional label—say, “joy” or “happiness”—because the experiences converge on a cluster of responses (thoughts and feelings having to do with contentment, satisfaction, and the like) that share a certain surface likeness.20 But, of course, erotic amor and parental amor, or the joy of good eating and the joy of good thinking, are not one and the same thing, either as psychophysical states or as scripts, the sequences of experience that include judgments, beliefs, and desires: the cluster of generally similar responses to which the label amor or “joy” gets attached is just the point on which the different scripts converge. The differences among the scripts can be variously drawn, and one of the most culturally interesting ways we can draw the differences is by considering how the relevant judgments, beliefs, and desires are constituted: what are their bases, aims, and implications, and how do they use some of the fundamental distinctions that we construct to make sense of the world—body vs. mind, or self vs. other, or right vs. wrong, or nature vs. culture? Such questions are among the chief concerns of the book; but before we go on to pursue some answers, I should round off these introductory remarks by making plain what I think we can achieve through the approach sketched so far, what claims can fairly be made for it, and especially what limitations should be recognized. First, as already noted, this is a study above all of the social and cultural elite, from which emerged the people—for the most part 9\n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nmale, wealthy, and “well-bred”—who wrote the texts on which we must rely: there is no obvious way to predict how (or whether) the emotional lives of nonelites were very different, and not much evidence that the elites themselves thought they were (save perhaps in thinking that a “sense of shame” was a luxury the poor could not afford),21 but my references to “the Romans” necessarily do not embrace all the Romans. Similarly, and to a degree that is also unavoidable, this book is fundamentally about Romans talking about their emotional experience, or ascribing such experience to others, for the most part in the poised discourse of carefully crafted texts. We plainly cannot get at the unmediated character of the experience itself; equally plainly, not everyone who talks about experiencing a certain emotion can be taken actually to experience it, and still less can everyone to whom a certain emotion is ascribed be taken to feel it—to say nothing of fictional characters, to whom emotions are regularly ascribed though they have no actual capacity for feeling at all. Fortunately, because of the stress placed here on emotions’ cognitive content and the structures of thought that shape emotional scripts, such considerations do not raise serious obstacles. When I say to a friend, “Damn, Jack, I really envy that new car of yours!” or “You know, Jack, Jim is so envious of your promotion he’s eating his heart out,” Jim or I may or may not be experiencing the psychophysical effects associated with envy (if Jack is my friend, I’m probably not, but one never knows about Jim). The structure of the underlying thought, however, and the kind of evaluation it conveys are in each case the same as they would be were Jim’s or my feelings fully engaged: the statements are therefore intelligible, plausible, and accessible for analysis in a way that would not be true were I to say, “You know, Jack, Jim is so pink at your promotion he’s eating his hair.” For our purposes, it is the structure of the thought and the presumed evaluation that matter most.22 Relatedly, it is a kind of limitation that we are concerned almost exclusively with scenes of emotion where specific and explicit emotion-talk is used; for it is obviously not the case that texts (in any language) represent emotions only when emotion-terms are present, and neither is it the case that the emotion terms here considered are the only terms associated with the relevant scripts.23 But for all that this is not a very short book, these are just the first steps that we are taking, and these steps can lead to broader views: when we understand the basic structures of thought and behavior that converge on a given emotion-term, and when we understand how those structures are related both to each other and to the structures associated with other terms, we can claim with greater confidence to understand—through Roman eyes, and not through the filter of our own sensibilities—scenes built upon the same structures, even when they happen to be devoid of emotion-talk. A final important dimension of the book, and at least in a strict sense another limitation, is its chronological range. As remarked at the outset, we are concerned with the late Republic and early Empire—primarily, the first cen10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntury  and first century , with excursions into the second centuries on either side. We will not extend our range much later, because the rise of Christianity surely reflects and produces changes in cultural psychology that deserve a book to themselves; nor will we directly take in the early and middle Republic, because we do not have the grounds on which to reconstruct the emotional experience of (say) the heroic general Quintus Fabius Maximus at the end of the third century , much less of the semilegendary Camillus two centuries earlier. The evidence that we do have, of what their posterity assumed the emotional experience of such figures would be, is instead useful for understanding that posterity: when Livy (say) attributes an emotion to Maximus, with the structure of thought that the attribution implies, we are justified in assuming that the emotion and the thought made cultural sense to Livy and his contemporaries, whatever the ancient general himself would have thought and felt. Finally, it is worth stressing that, for the period with which we are centrally concerned, the fundamental emotional scripts examined, as they are represented in the speech of the literate elite, do not (with one exception to be noted shortly) undergo significant change. Despite many profound alterations in social and political life, the basic structures abide: the “Roman revolution” did not entail a revolution in affect. This is, frankly, not a conclusion I quite anticipated, in so stark a form, when I began work on this book. But, as I learned more about the emotions as human phenomena, and about the specifically Roman versions of them in context, the deep conservatism of their structures made this outcome seem unsurprising, indeed expectable. There are two reasons for this. First is the matter of time-scale. A man who as a youth had fought with the great Marius to turn back the Cimbri at Vercellae (101 ) might in old age have known a boy who would live to see the dread imperial minister Sejanus fall at Rome (31 ); he, in turn, could have heard the schoolboy exercises of a poet who would later praise the reign of Trajan (98–117 ). That significant affective change would sweep the elite of a profoundly traditional society in so short a time is improbable on its face. To consider the matter from another way around: in the nearly one hundred years since “the long nineteenth century” ended with the Armistice of November 1918, culture and society in North America (though of course not only North America) have seen—in communications, travel, warfare, commerce, education, health and human welfare, the structures of family and community, the arts and religion, and our conceptions of the self: in short, every consequential aspect of human life—upheaval and change that make the Romans’ shift from Republic to Principate look like a placid sleeper’s turn from side to side in the course of an afternoon’s nap. Yet, in that time, while the prominence of (say) our shame or regret may have waxed or waned in the constellation of emotions, and while the actions or states of affairs that provoke these emotions may have shifted this way or that, as some new ones came into being while others passed away, the basic structures of thought that make shame and 11\n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nregret identifiable as such have remained the same. In much the same way, though the coming of the Principate no doubt introduced new occasions on which members of the elite might experience their versions of shame and regret, while older occasions passed away with the passing of the Republic, it was the circumstantial content of the behavior that changed, not the pertinent evaluations and feelings: as we shall see, for example, the younger Pliny expresses anxiety at the shame (pudor) he might experience should a protégé suffer electoral defeat (repulsa) because it will appear that he, Pliny, misled the emperor in making certain guarantees while pressing his patronage of the candidate; though this basis for concern would have had no very close counterpart in Cicero’s day, we can be certain that repulsa was no less a cause of pudor— the pain experienced at seeing oneself seen as devalued—just as success was equally a cause of pleasure.24 Emotions, or anyway how we conceive and speak of them, do change, and some can even be said to come into being and pass away. Acedia—most familiar as Sloth, the misleading label that it wears among the Seven Deadly Sins— was a debilitating affective state, embracing not just idleness but despair and sadness as well, which seemed to come into being as a distinct emotion in late antiquity and to pass out of existence again with the waning of the Middle Ages, so that it can now be called “extinct.”25 But we do not put off and take on forms of emotion as we might doff last year’s fashions in favor of the new: the shifts are very slow (think of the three centuries, and the cultural chasm, that separate Robert Burton’s “melancholy” from that of George Norton),26 and they often require jolts from outside the cultural context in which the emotions are embedded. Which brings us to the other, still more important reason why we should not expect great change to be a feature of the story I am about to tell. For, in the history of Rome’s empire—the seven centuries that followed Hannibal’s defeat, let’s say—the most profound and consequential change was not the emergence of the Principate, for all its importance, but the rise and spread of Christianity. Compared with the cultural changes that followed in the latter’s wake, the Roman elite’s accomodation of the Principate amounted to not much more than a rearranging of the mental furniture, an adjustment that could be made using the cultural and psychic materials at hand.27 It is accordingly not surprising that the one notable change we will see—in the explicit conception of paenitentia as what we would call remorse—is precisely a product of Christianity.28 But even this change did not mean that other, older structures of thought were simply superseded. Rather, the new conception was just added as one more option to the emotional repertoire that interests us. Let’s turn, then, to consider that repertoire, and to try to understand the first of its components.\n\n12\n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\n1 Between Respect and Shame Verecundia and the Art of Social Worry The epitaph of the Republican poet Pacuvius (ca. 220–130 ) is preserved by the scholar and littérateur Aulus Gellius, who presents it to us as “verecundus and pure in the highest degree, and worthy of [the poet’s] superbly discriminating dignity (elegantissima gravitate)”: Young man, though you’re in a hurry, this bit of stone asks you to look at it, and then to read what’s written: here lie the bones of Marcus Pacuvius, poet. I didn’t want you to be unaware of this. Fare well.1\n\nGellius was nothing if not keen for words, so it should be worthwhile to consider what makes him think this inscription—which is to say, the man for whom it speaks—“verecundus in the highest degree.” Pretty plainly, the trait has to do with the way the poem negotiates what in other hands could be an importunate request for attention: “Hey there, look at me!” I suggest that three moves are crucial to the negotiation in this case. First, we see the restrained and unassertive terms used to refer to the self that is making the request: initially, in a common conceit of epitaphs, the stone itself, here a mere, diminutive saxulum, and then the poet, whose presence is marked in seven simple words that state his identity in conventional terms without trumpeting his achievement (“hic sunt poetae Pacuvi Marci sita / ossa”)— a reticence that contrasts strongly with the epitaph of another Republican poet, Naevius, “full of Campanian arrogance,” that Gellius quotes earlier in the same chapter (1. 24. 2 plenum superbiae Campanae). Second, the speaking voice not only registers awareness of the addressee’s circumstances—the young passerby, caught up in a young man’s haste—but also foregrounds that awareness, suggesting that the other’s circumstances are at least as important as, and may well take precedence over, the interests of the person making the request. Finally, that same concern for the other emerges at the inscription’s end, in the motive given for imposing on his attention: it was just an opportunity for the addressee to profit, by being relieved of some ignorance—“hoc volebam, nescius ne esses.” \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nIt was this fine balance of self and other, I believe, that earned Gellius’s approbation as verecundissimum, and it can be seen in many, many other texts. Here, briefly, are three other examples. In narrating the end of Porsenna’s attempt to restore the disgraced family of Tarquin the Proud to Rome (2. 15. 1–5), Livy tells us that a delegation sent by Porsenna to the senate received no reply; rather, that body hurriedly sent to Porsenna a delegation of its own, composed of all the most honored men from its midst (missi confestim honoratissimus quisque ex patribus). They did this (they explained to Porsenna when they arrived), not because they couldn’t have just said to his ambassadors “What part of ‘no’ don’t you understand?” but in order to put an end to the matter once and for all, lest in the midst of their mutually beneficial relations they be grievously upset by turns, Porsenna by requesting what the Romans could not grant, the Romans by having to say “no” to someone they wished to deny nothing. At that, Livy says, Porsenna was “vanquished by verecundia”—and in the transaction as it unfolded, that should be the Romans’ verecundia no less than his own: for the Romans had scrupulously made plain their respect, both in selecting their noble delegates and in casting their refusal in terms that showed their sensitivity to Porsenna’s own interests, thus allowing him to maintain face in relations generally marked more by cooperation than by confrontation; in response, Porsenna himself felt verecundia, which caused him to step back from pressing his point and to show respect to the Romans in his turn.2 Again from the early days of the Republic, Livy reports that, in 446, the consuls Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus and Agrippa Furius neither requested a triumph nor were offered one by the senate for their brilliant victory over the Volsci and Aequi. Because his sources gave no reason for this omission, Livy ventures a conjecture: because the senate [three years earlier, in 449] had denied a triumph to the consuls Valerius and Horatius, who had not only beat the Volsci and Aequi but also gained glory by ending the Sabine war, the [present] consuls felt verecundia (verecundiae fuit . . . consulibus) at requesting a triumph for half so great an accomplishment, lest the judgment appear to be personal rather than based on the merits of the case (“magis hominum ratio quam meritorum habita videretur”), even if their request were granted.3\n\nIn Livy’s historical imagination, the consuls’ verecundia must include two interlocking concerns: because any triumph they gained for themselves would appear to be less well deserved than the triumph that Valerius and Horatius were denied, their own honors would appear a bit lame at the same time that they compounded the insult already done to their predecessors by the senate’s ad hominem snub—concerns that impel them to consider the others’ position \n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\nand, especially, to collaborate in maintaining the others’ face, even at the price of forgoing what they themselves could rightfully claim. We can note, too, that by the time Livy makes his conjecture here, he has already characterized the senate’s snubbing of Valerius and Horatius as malevolent (3. 63. 5 “maligne . . . decrevit”), has presented the two as being scrupulous in point of procedure (3. 63. 6–7), and has made plain both that they deserved to have a triumph decreed by the senate and that they were exemplary consuls in general, putting freedom (libertas) before their own material interests (opes: 3. 64. 3 ff.). In effect Livy has created for Valerius and Horatius the face that his conjecture allows Quinctius and Furius to save. Third, and in contrast with public affairs of historical moment, a matter of domestic economy from the letters of the younger Pliny. It seems that Pliny’s grandfather-in-law, Fabatus, at Ticinum, in northern Italy, wished formally to manumit some slaves, which he could do only before a magistrate. Not a problem, writes Pliny: if Fabatus will let Pliny intercede with his ancient and intimate friend Calestrius Tiro, he will arrange for Tiro to stop at Fabatus’s place on his way to taking up a governorship in Spain.4 Fabatus should just put aside his excessive verecundia, which in this case entails both thinking too much of the other’s interests—in supposing it would be tiresome (molestum) for Tiro—and thinking too little of his own. Getting verecundia right means getting the balance of these interests right. As the combined testimony of these texts suggests, verecundia animates the art of knowing your proper place in every social transaction and basing your behavior on that knowledge; by guiding behavior in this way, verecundia establishes or affirms the social bond between you and others, all of whom (ideally) play complementary roles. Most fully, this means that you will each gauge your standing relative to the others; you will each present yourself in a way that at least will not give offense—for example, by confrontation or importunity—and that preferably will signal your full awareness of the others’ face, the character they wear in the transaction and the respect that that character is due; and you will stop short of overtly pressing your full claims, yet not be excessively self-effacing—not obliterate your own face, the character you are wearing and the respect that it is due.5 This is the script, the sequence of interlocking motives and moves, that someone experiencing verecundia—a verecundus person—enacts; by enacting that script, the verecundus person draws a line for the self to observe, in settings where no such line is drawn by formal or external authority, where he or she must improvise a performance as a well-socialized person. Or so I argue in this chapter, in which we try to get a clear view of verecundia’s components and the cultural work that the emotion performs, before we move on in the next chapter to another, much more complex emotion of self-restraint and selfassessment, pudor. At the end of that chapter we will be in a position to consider the relation between the two. \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nNow, the anecdote from Pliny draws attention to and plays upon the etymological link between verecundia and the verb vereri, and so verecundia’s grounding in a kind of fear: to be verecundus is to feel, or to be disposed to feel, vere-, as being iracundus (“angry,” “wrathful”) is to feel, or to be disposed to feel, ira.6 This fear is not dread or gut-wrenching anxiety, much less terror or panic. Rather, it is the fear suggested by the English words “wary” and “worry” (there is no etymological link among the three, tant pis): a mild and strategic sort of fear, which manifests itself above all in circumspection and the wish to avoid drawing attention to oneself in an improper way or to an improper degree.7 As just indicated, this emotion can be experienced in two different forms, an “occurrent” form and a “dispositional” form; since this distinction will recur in all our discussions save one, it is worth pausing here a bit to clarify it.8 When I report that I am experiencing verecundia in its occurrent form, I mean to convey that I am experiencing a fully embodied worry about mishandling (in particular ways) a specific interpersonal transaction already in progress, a form of fearful self-consciousness that at least in some instances approximates our being and feeling flustered or embarrassed. By contrast, if I say that I am dispositionally a verecundus person (though, being such, I probably would never say that), I mean that I tend as a general matter to be wary about mishandling (in particular ways) interpersonal transactions whenever they might occur: my self-description conveys that I am the sort of person much inclined to experience the occurrent form of verecundia and am habitually sensitive to contexts that arouse it. In this same way, iracundia (iracundus), in common Latin usage, can convey either the disposition to feel ira—“irascibility,” “wrathfulness”—or the occurrent emotion itself. Now, though it is common to speak of an “emotional disposition” of a given sort or a “dispositional form” of a given emotion (as I do throughout), the disposition itself is strictly just that, an inclination or tendency; it is not an experience of the emotion—the sequence that runs from perception to reponse —and it has no particular feeling of its own. But such an inclination typically feeds, and is fed by, three other traits that do shape our experience of life in ways tied closely to feeling. Dispositionally fearful people (for example) are not only more inclined to experience occurrent fear than their bolder counterparts, they also are more inclined to imagine the potentially fearful aspects of life’s circumstances; they more quickly imagine, too, the potential becoming actual, and they therefore more commonly feel a jolt of fear “as if” the potential were real, fear “at the very thought.” (These traits together suggest why someone with no imagination would be unlikely to have any emotional disposition at all.) And for the dispositionally joyful person, or the dispositionally verecundus person, exactly the same can be said, with only the appropriate changes in labels. Because the disposition so readily leads to an embodied experience of the emotion proleptically, “at the very thought,” the dispositionally verecundus person tends to live with the foretaste of this form of worry at the \n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\nback of his throat, as the more generally fearful person chronically tastes a more generalized fear and as the dispositionally iracundus person lives with the foretaste of anger: life habitually lived as one of these sorts of person (or as a sort that combines two or more of these sorts) simply “feels different” from a life lived as some other sort. It is such habituation, too, that causes emotional dispositions to be counted among the abiding ethical traits that we commonly call virtues and vices. That is one of the things meant by saying that the dispositional form of an emotion expresses what “sort of person” I am: it sorts me into an ethical category more reliably than any given occurrence of the fully embodied form that is prompted by a single judgment of one specific set of actual circumstances.9 However—and all that said—it is the structure of any given emotion’s underlying thought that is our main concern here; because that structure is essentially the same in both the dispositional and the occurrent forms, the distinction between the two will not normally be at the center our discussion. So, to turn now to verecundia in action, we can say that the simplest social product of verecundia is what might be called “ignorability”: not being invisible, quite, but being seen to claim the minimum amount of social space needed to carry out a given line of action.10 This is a social virtue that most of us manage to practice most of the time—as when we amble down a city street without making a spectacle of ourselves or colliding with the odd passerby—and most of us acquire it early on—for example, when our parents teach us that speaking at top volume in an elevator is “not polite.” In fact, as has often been observed, the modern elevator is a fine stage for observing this trait in action, as the occupants typically space themselves as far apart as possible, stand facing in the same direction to avoid eye contact, often break off conversations begun before entering the car, and generally mime a shared fascination with the display that marks the passing floors. Had the Romans known elevators, verecundia would surely have been mentioned in connection with their use. Cultivating ignorability has two complementary aims that are also two of the basic effects of verecundia: avoiding offense to others, by avoiding improper assertion of the self. Were a fellow-passenger on our crowded elevator to extract a cell phone and begin a conversation in the braying tones that cell phones seem to require, I assume that the rest of us would consider him an offensive fool for claiming too much social space for himself while granting us too little: rather than being ignorable, he would force himself on our attention; rather than trying to minimize his own presence, he would treat us as though we were not there. Our estimation of him as a person—the minimal estimation, “competent adult,” that we standardly grant strangers absent evidence to the contrary—accordingly would be lowered. These, too, are the concerns of verecundia, which monitors and restrains the self in order to avoid giving offense to others—and which by avoiding offense to others succeeds in protecting the self and its value. Cicero very helpfully makes these dynamics plain \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nin his discussion of “appropriate actions,” when he pairs verecundia with justice (iustitia) in discussing the respect—the reverentia (note here too the etymological link)—that should be paid to others and to their opinion of you: whereas it is the role of iustitia not to “violate” others—not to do them obvious, even violent, harm—it is the role of verecundia not to “offend” them.11 Implied here is that it fundamentally rests with the others to set the bounds of propriety and to define the degree to which, or the means by which, you can extend your self: you have offended me if I believe that you have offended me, and that means that you can never be completely sure before the fact— hence the wariness and the worry. This is one of the distinctions between verecundia and iustitia, insofar as the latter, concerned with iniuria, belongs more to the realm of objectively determinate violations and the workings of positive law. Not that verecundia is wholly indeterminate: if I go dancing naked through the forum just because I feel like it, I can be pretty certain that I will give offense and be considered inverecundus (and probably mad as well). But the boundaries of offensive behavior are much less clear than the boundaries of injustice and tend more to be established by the negotiation of each social transaction as it unfolds. And so the wariness, the circumspection of verecundia must be constant and pervasive in all one’s acts. Here is a very select catalog of behaviors—some obvious, others less so—in which a Roman speaker takes verecundia to play a role in restraining an agent from offensive self-assertion: —there is of course the verecundia displayed in not grabbing all the choicest morsels for yourself at the dinner table;12 —but there is also the verecundia to be observed in using metaphors: you should be free of the extravagance that calls attention to itself and instead, like a person entering a “space that is not his own” (alienus locus), be conscious of being there on sufferance (ut precario, non vi, venisse videatur);13 —there is the verecundia displayed in not blowing your own horn;14 —and the verecundia displayed in not calling yourself a person’s “friend” (thereby claiming equality) when you should properly say that you are his “client” (thereby acknowledging subordination);15 —there is the verecundia displayed by nondogmatic skeptics, who stop short of claiming to know the truth;16 —and there are the multiple forms of verecundia displayed in the courtroom, from not stalking about and invading the opponents’ space to “bending over backwards,” as we would say, to be fair when serving as a judge in a case where your own interests are at stake.17\n\nBecause the opportunities for offense are so rich and varied, the self-monitoring that verecundia entails is constant; because this constant monitoring makes it an emotion of self-attention and self-assessment—like our pride, shame, or \n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\nembarassment—verecundia was understood by the Romans to differ from other forms of fear in the way it was embodied, being marked not by the pallor associated with timor or metus but by the blush associated with pudor.18 But, having spoken so far in terms of “ignorability” and the avoidance of “offense,” I should elaborate on the forms and consequences of this self-attention, lest I create the impression that verecundia was, and was regarded by the Romans as, an emotion confined to the realm of etiquette and mere politeness. That is far from being the case. Social life, broadly understood, is the context in which verecundia operates: though there are many emotions that could readily be experienced by a lone castaway on a desert island—hope and fear most notably among them— he is not likely to experience verecundia unless some other poor devil is washed ashore with him. But, beyond being an emotion that social life prompts, verecundia itself is crucial to making social life possible. This role for the emotion was implied by Cicero’s comments in On Appropriate Actions remarked earlier, and it is made explicit early in Book 2 of the same work: the gathering of humans in cities led to the creation of customs and formal law (leges moresque constituti), to equity and a fixed way of life (iuris aequa discriptio certaque vivendi disciplina); on these there followed the effects of what we call socialization—gentleness of spirit (mansuetudo animorum) and verecundia—and so the mutuality that makes life secure and supportable (“ut esset vita munitior atque ut dando et accipiendo mutandisque facultatibus et commodis nulla re egeremus”).19 The thought finds expression repeatedly, in one form or another, in Cicero’s philosophical works, and it is a thought that shapes his practical advocacy as well, for example in his approach to attacking the reputation of an opponent in court. It is not something that he does readily, he says, but the circumstances require it, and so he will do it verecunde modiceque, with restraint and with proper regard for the face that both he and his opponent are wearing.20 His own face is determined here by his relationship with his client, as a “loyal and reliable friend”; the attack he is about to deliver is both required by that relation and the means for making the relation plain in this context. His opponent’s face, on the other hand, is determined by the relation he has to Cicero, as someone who has had no reason to judge Cicero a personal enemy before; the attack he is about to receive is both moderated by that relation and, in its moderation, intended to allow the relation to continue in its current mode. The mutuality of verecundia, the way that its wariness looks both to the self and to the other—to the extent of seeing the matter as the other sees it, as Cicero does here—is the essence of the emotion as a force of social cohesion. I cannot gauge where I stand relative to you unless I first consider where you stand; and while considering your standpoint does not strictly entail considering your viewpoint, it certainly exerts pressure in that direction. The concern with face that we see here moving in both directions can have different emphases in different circumstances, being directed now more \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\ntoward the self, now more toward the other. Sometimes the concern is predominantly with your own face, when what matters most is to avoid what a slightly archaic English turn of phrase calls “being out of countenance”—that is, having reason to be abashed. Quintilian illustrates this point when he connects verecundia with the job of advocates who find they must shade the truth in setting out and explaining the facts of a case in a way favorable to their side.21 Some such “false expositions” rely on devices (instrumenta) external to the advocate’s argument (for example, witnesses who provide a false alibi), while others rely solely on the wit (ingenium) of the advocate who makes up the story. That is where verecundia enters in: the crucial question is how big a whopper the advocate can tell without blushing—that is why (Quintilian adds in an etymological aside) this spinning of the facts is called a “color,” because it can bring a blush to the cheeks. An advocate in that position, we can take it, could blush for one of two reasons, not mutually exclusive: becoming aware that others were looking at him (or anticipating that others would look at him) with frank disbelief, he would see himself being seen as a liar and so be unable to maintain the face of an honest man; or as the burden of falsehood became more than he himself could bear, he would see himself as a liar and so be unable to maintain the face of an honest man even in his own eyes.22 Let me give two other examples that involve similar dynamics, the first offered, again, by Quintilian. (That Quintilian, as a teacher of rhetoric, and the grammarian Servius are among the richest witnesses for understanding verecundia is not insignificant, given the role just such teachers played in socializing members of the elite in traditional virtue.)23 When praising the vividness that Cicero lends his depiction of the corrupt governor Verres standing on the Sicilian shore—a disgraceful spectacle, “a praetor of the Roman people in sandals and a purple Greek cloak, his tunic extending down to his ankles, leaning on some bimbo” (Verr. 2. 5. 86)—Quintilian says that the depiction seems to make visible even details that it does not explicitly mention: certainly, Quintilian says, I seem to be able to make out the expression on the pair’s faces, their looks, and their disgraceful endearments (“ego certe mihi cernere videor et vultum et oculos et deformes utriusque blanditias”)—and not just that, but also the sentiments of those who were present to watch (“et eorum qui aderant tacitam aversationem ac timidam verecundiam”).24 The audience of the sordid scene is presumed by Quintilian to have felt—no doubt because he would have felt—revulsion (aversatio) and verecundia, a concern for their own face, which is affronted by being implicated in the scene at all. In essence, Verres’ lack of verecundia causes the witnesses to experience verecundia of their own, as they see themselves being seen as the sort of people who could tolerate such a spectacle; seeing themselves being seen in this way endangers their face as decent people. But, because Verres was, after all, the praetor, actual confrontation is out of the question, and so their aversatio is silent (tacita), their verecundia timid (timida). \n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\nA second example, by contrast, expressly involves the threat to your face that results from failure to feel verecundia in the proper way. In one of his letters to Lucilius Seneca tells of riding in a rude country cart and blushing whenever he came upon an entourage with classier outfittings (comitatus lautior): in such circumstances, before such an audience, he became conscious of his face as a “gentleman,” which he felt was under strain. The point of interest, however, is that to Seneca’s Stoicizing mind it is the wrong face to begin with: as someone trying to make progress toward Stoic wisdom, he should not ascribe any value to externals—the rustic cart, the half-dead mules that pull it, or the muleteer’s bare feet, all of which he catalogs—nor should he identify with them in any way. His blush is in this respect doubly motivated: the part of him that is not yet sufficiently Stoic feels distress because he is worried about maintaining the face of a conventional gentleman; by implication, the part of him that wants to be Stoic feels distress because he realizes that he is not maintaining the face of a sage, to whom the only important thing is the right action of his own mind. That is why Seneca here speaks of his sentiment as perversa recti verecundia, a “respect for what is right that has been turned on its head.”25 But what of concern for the face of others? As I suggested earlier, in connection with Quintilian’s response to Cicero’s Verres, Quintilian imagines the onlookers’ reaction by imagining how he himself would have felt had he been present to witness Verres’ lack of verecundia: for that, in Quintilian’s understanding, is the controlling element of the scene. Because Verres is incapable of feeling verecundia, he has no concern for his own face and so places no decent limits on his own behavior: he acts in a merely self-gratifying way, as gratification of the self happens to be defined at that moment. And, because he lacks concern for his own face, he has no concern for the face of others, either: were he aware of the onlookers as persons with their own claims to decency, he would not have made them witnesses to his behavior and in that respect implicated them in it. But, because the onlookers do (in Quintilian’s imagination) possess this quality, they are more concerned with Verres’ face than he is himself. They want to turn away, not only because they experience the feelings of decent people whose face has been implicated in disgrace but also because they experience the feeling that decent people have when confronted by another who is carelessly or willfully disgracing himself: the verecundia of “not knowing where to look,” the form of the emotion comparable to our “being embarrassed for.” As William Ian Miller remarks, “Our own embarrassment is often our best indication that we have judged others to be humiliating themselves”: not looking such people in the face is the only means left to us for helping them save face—as we wish to do just because we are decent people—and so we avert our glance.26 We have seen concern for the position of others figure prominently in verecundia before, for example in Livy’s account of the Romans’ negotiations with \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nPorsenna. Here are two other examples from Livy, whose ear for this sensitivity was very well developed.27 First, offering a mirror image to the dealings with Porsenna, there are the remarks Scipio Africanus is imagined making to Hannibal in their colloquy before the battle at Zama, when Scipio declares himself bound by no verecundia toward his opponent:28 because Hannibal has not willingly sought peace, Scipio feels no need to avoid confrontation and no scruple in pressing his own interests to the full, and he has no concern for the interests and face of the other, as his peremptory tone by itself makes clear. The second, more elaborate example is drawn from Livy’s vivid recreation of the debate, in 195 , over legislation meant to curb spending on luxuries, when the women of Rome— against all custom—turned out en masse to protest in the forum and a shaken Cato the elder, as consul, had to make his way to the senate chamber through their midst. Having reached the safety of the curia, Cato has a few choice words to say about this “female upheaval” (consternatio muliebris), including remarks on the several ways in which it engaged his own verecundia. Having first reported that he could not pass through the forum in the midst of the massed array of women without blushing (“equidem non sine rubore quodam paulo ante per medium agmen mulierum in forum perveni”), he says that it was only the verecundia he felt before the dignity and decency of certain individual women— more than the verecundia he felt for the lot of them—that restrained him from rebuking them (“nisi me verecundia singularum magis maiestatis et pudoris quam universarum tenuisset, ne compellatae a consule viderentur”). And so he goes on to give them in absentia the scolding that his proper emotion kept him from giving them face to face.29 Cato’s verecundia here is richly drawn and multidimensional. His own feeling, attested by his blush, is identical to the verecundia that Quintilian ascribed to the witnesses of Verres’ unseemly display: by stepping beyond conventional restraints of decorum to gather in the forum, the women, like Verres, had shown no concern either for their own face as decent people or for the face of others; so Cato, like the onlookers, responds as someone who feels that his own face as a decent person has been put under strain. As in the case of Verres’ audience, too, the self-regarding dimension of verecundia is paired with regard for the others, here explicitly: if Cato, as consul, had rebuked the women, their face would have been impaired, since they could not avoid seeing themselves being seen as what they would in fact have been—the sort of women whom a consul would rebuke. In this case, Cato seems to imply, his sensitivity toward the face of certain individuals overrode his responsibility as consul; in any event, his own sense of verecundia is presented as being fully active even when—or perhaps, especially when—the verecundia of the others was defective.30 So, in any given transaction where verecundia is in play, the explicit emphasis might fall more on the proper restraint of the self and the preservation of one’s own face than on the proper attention to the other persons involved, or vice versa; but, standardly, both concerns are at least implied. In fact, the \n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\nmutuality of the emotion, its two-way concern for face, is so pervasive that it occurs in contexts where we might not look for it, since our own cultural orientation is rather different. Take nudity, for example. Romans of the elite long thought of themselves as being more reserved about nudity than Greeks, who they believed were ready to get naked on any pretext. In that regard, the Romans might seem very much like typical middle-class North Americans, whose anxiety at the thought of being seen naked in public shapes many a bad dream. But there is, I believe, a significant difference. My fear of being seen naked, as part of what we would call my “modesty,” is above all self-protective: my anxiety over the impact your seeing me naked would have on me dwarfs any concern I might have for the ill effects that seeing me naked would have on you. In fact, there is often at least a tacit assumption that you would like nothing better than to see me naked (in dreams of being seen naked, the viewers are more or less explicitly figured as voyeurs). In that respect, the self-regarding character of our form of modesty has more than a touch of narcissism about it. Not so for the Romans, whose verecundia at the thought of nudity assumes that your seeing me naked would be as unpleasant and face-impairing for you as it would be for me. That is the assumption, for example, in the extended remarks on nudity that Cicero offers in On Appropriate Actions: in this connection (he says), human verecundia merely imitates the handiwork of natura, which has designed the human body in such a way that the parts that have an honorable appearance (species honesta) are put right where everyone can see them, while the parts that involve the necessities of nature, being ugly (deformis), are tucked away out of sight.31 All the arguments in the passage, based as they are on a concern for decorum, approach the thought of nakedness from the point of view of the offended onlooker.32 And Valerius Maximus, drawing on the same passage of Cicero, elaborates the thought.33 Having just mentioned one form of verecundia—that felt by a wife for her husband’s “greatness” (maiestas), a point to which we will return—he turns to another form—that which keeps adult male relatives from bathing in each others’ presence—and he draws the moral: clearly the same profound scruple attaches to our relations by blood and marriage as attaches to our relations with the gods, for to expose yourself naked to either would entail the gravest disrespect.34 An emotion constructed in this way obviously is an important force of social control, regulating the behavior of free individuals in a civil community; and there are several components of the service verecundia performs in this regard that deserve emphasis, beginning with the words “free” and “civil.” No slave is ever described as experiencing verecundia, presumably because slaves—at least according to the ideology of Roman slavery—have no autonomous volition, hence no actual self, hence no face to maintain or lose: there is, accordingly, no need for an emotion to draw a line that the nonexistent self ought not cross. Indeed, the one instance where verecundia \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nis mentioned, prescriptively, in connection with slaves is the exception that proves the ideological rule: the jurist Ulpian (early third cent. ) notes that though slaves are generally barred from bringing formal accusations against their masters, they can bring complaints before the praetor provided they do so under certain specific headings (of cruelty and the like), and provided they act with verecundia (si verecunde expostulent)—in a manner that shows that they know their place.35 Similarly—and much more interestingly—soldiers experience verecundia not much much more frequently than do slaves. (By contrast, soldiers do very commonly experience pudor: we return to this contrast at the end of chapter 2.)36 I take it that the lack of soldierly verecundia has less to do with the lack of a soldierly self than with the nature of the circumstances in which the self is active. Verecundia operates in circumstances where there is in principle a choice to be made as to whose interests will be put to the fore and whose will be restrained: as we have frequently seen, it implies a voluntary stepping back from pressing one’s own interest (at a minimum) or a voluntary privileging of the interests of the other. For soldiers, however, issues of selfrestraint, self-expression, and respect are not left to be sorted out by some haphazardly socialized emotion: the line that verecundia informally draws for us in civil society is more reliably drawn for the soldier by the chain of command and, ultimately, by the commander’s imperium, his power to demand obedience (obsequium) on pain of death. Slaves and soldiers aside, then, we are all called upon to exercise our verecundia to make our civil community a livable place. Even the emperor is expected to be verecundus, assuming he has any claim on being a “civil prince” (princeps civilis): as the younger Pliny tells Trajan again and again, his willingness to speak and walk with members of the senate, as merely one man among other men, is one of the traits that most distinguishes him from certain vile predecessors.37 And, to the extent that the virtues of civil society are just the virtues of the household writ large, we can say that verecundia begins at home. It is certainly the case that the emotion is mentioned and discussed with special frequency in connection with those whose roles in the household are particularly important, though their capacities for self-control are thought to be underdeveloped relative to those of the adult male: I mean children and women. The verecundia of the Roman child before the parent—and, above all, of the son before the father—is perhaps the archetypal case, always matching restraint of the self and concern for one’s own face with concern for the interests and face of the other. This sort of verecundia begins to be represented with Plautus, and the representation extends the length and breadth of Roman literature:38 the relationship is so common and familiar that just one example should suffice. In a letter to Minicius Fundanus, whose consulship he anticipated, Pliny promotes another friend’s son, who would be a candidate for a quaestorship in the same year (Ep. 4. 15. 5–6): the son is a better man even than his father (iuvenis . . . ipso patre melior), Pliny thinks, and the father wants \n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\nPliny both to think and to say that; but the son’s own verecundia forbids such a thing (“nescio an dicam, quod me pater et sentire et dicere cupit, adulescentis verecundia vetat”). The son’s willing subordination to the father, in the context of the letter of recommendation, adds one further guarantee that the man being commended is fundamentally the right sort of person; the fact that he is the right sort of person allows Pliny the conceit that he adopts, the suggestion that the father would be willing to have it said that his son outstrips him in excellence—which of course is the proper expression of paternal verecundia toward the son.39 The verecundia of women, by contrast, is somewhat more varied, but it is still largely confined to just three areas of behavior. Two of these we have already glimpsed. The first is the verecundia that restrained proper women from mixing themselves in the public concerns of men: it is not that Roman women were expected to keep themselves sequestered or behind the veil, but they were not supposed to involve themselves in business of the forum or the courtroom— and here the indignation that we heard Livy’s Cato express earlier finds an echo not only in the moralizing of a Valerius Maximus but also, repeatedly, in the jurists of the Digest.40 The second area in which a decent Roman woman experienced verecundia was in her relations with her husband, a point made with particular clarity in some remarks of Valerius Maximus at which we have already glanced.41 When husbands and wives are at odds, Valerius tells us, they can go to the shrine of the goddess Viriplaca and take turns giving vent to all that’s on their minds (ibi inuicem locuti quae voluerant); then they can return home from this therapy, in harmony (concordes) once again. Taking the goddess’s name to be derived from “making husbands happy” (a placandis viris), Valerius makes plain what he means by “harmony” here. The spouses are concordes because each knows his or her proper place relative to the other: the wife pays honos to her husband, respecting his face as the greater party—that is, his maiestas (virorum maiestati debitum a feminis . . . honorem)—and the husband (it must be implied) respects his wife’s face as the lesser party. In this way, they can remain “in affection’s yoke on terms of parity” (in pari iugo caritatis)—the parity here being the complementarity of the arrangement, or perhaps its fairness in Valerius’s eyes, obviously not its objective equality. The third field of womanly verecundia was of course concerned with sexuality, where the emotion was allied to the chastity (pudicitia) that it served to protect; here again we are on very familiar ground.42 A woman is expected to feel the restraint of verecundia whenever there is the prospect, or even mention, of sexual activity; if she does, she will remain pudica, a woman who engages only in licit forms of sex, in the appropriate circumstance, in appropriate ways, and with the appropriate person. That is why the virgo—the young woman of marriageable age who is not yet married—is closely associated with verecundia:43 sex for her is a real possibility, as it is not for a mere child (puella), and still it is not yet permitted. That is also why a woman’s nudity, when \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\ndisplayed anywhere to attract sexual attention, places a burden on verecundia over and above the queasiness already remarked of nudity in general: such a display threatens the pudicitia—their face as chaste persons—of both the woman being seen and the male who sees her. As the verecundia of children and women suggests, the emotion often entails, and serves to reinforce, a hierarchical point of view: the self-restraint of the inferior parties, the respect they feel for their superiors, the virtue of knowing their place and keeping to it. And it is certainly true that many, probably most, instances of the emotion have what might be called a vertical orientation, as the person who experiences the emotion signals, by experiencing it, that he knows where he stands on the social pyramid: just some of the forms the emotion can take as a force of hierarchical ordering include the verecundia felt for the old by the young, for the maiestas of magistrates by private citizens, for literary authorities and other cultural maximi viri by people of ordinary attainments, for the rich by the poor, for the senate by the commons, for the gods by all right-thinking mortals.44 But, even where verecundia works to create hierarchy, it should not—in principle, as a matter of the sentiment’s ideology—move in one direction only: the rich, for example, should respect the face of the poor and not simply oppress them (a moral taught with notable frequency in the declamatory themes of the rhetoric schools),45 just as we’ve seen that verecundia works both ways in relations between father and son or husband and wife. Equally to the point, verecundia operates horizontally no less than vertically, since it is properly felt between people who are peers, or who are willing to behave as if they are. We have seen this in the verecundia that informs the pose of the princeps civilis as merely first among equals,46 and we see it in the formula of politeness used when Cicero tells Brutus that if the essay on oratory that Brutus requested seems inadequate, it is perhaps because he, Cicero, imprudently took on too great a subject, out of the verecundia he felt at the thought of refusing (verecundia negandi)—for a refusal would have paid too little respect both to Brutus’s face, as a friend entitled to make such a request, and to Cicero’s own face, as an authoritative friend of whom such a request could be made.47 The verecundia between peers figures in less formulaic and more telling settings, too, as in the letter that Cicero wrote to Atticus in December of 61, when their relations were strained by the peevishiness of Cicero’s brother, Quintus, and his quarrels with his wife, Atticus’s sister Pomponia.48 After recounting to Atticus at some length how much he relies on his advice and conversation in all matters, Cicero adds that the verecundia of both of them has previously kept him from saying such things. Cicero does not elaborate, because of course one gentleman would know what another gentleman meant. I take it he means that speaking in such terms could betray a hint of condescension, framing Atticus in the role of mere adviser and supporter to the “great man” rather than his peer (earlier in the letter Cicero is at pains to stress, not \n\nBETWEEN RESPECT AND SHAME\n\nreally convincingly, that Atticus’s choice of “tranquillity,” otium, is honorable in a way parallel to his own “political striving,” ambitio). But in the letter to which Cicero replies, Atticus, evidently provoked by Quintus’s bad behavior, had catalogued the many services he had done for Cicero—something that (absent great provocation) verecundia would also normally keep a Roman gentleman from doing, out of concern for the beneficiary’s face. And so Cicero feels that he must acknowledge all the benefits derived from his relations with Atticus, whatever the norms of gentlemanly restraint would usually enjoin.49 I hope now that I have made plausible my original claim, that verecundia, as an emotion, animates the art of knowing your proper place in every social transaction and binds the free members of a civil community, exerting its force both vertically, across the different ranks of society, and horizontally, among members of comparable status. It would be possible to elaborate the case at much greater length, of course—but to do that would risk ignoring the force of verecundia itself, insofar as I would claim more space for myself than I properly need and show too little concern for your interests as my reader. In doing that, I would respect neither my face as a responsible writer nor yours as an attentive audience, and I would reasonably expect to pay a price. In fact, if I had any decency at all, I should experience a good, strong seizure of our next chapter’s subject, pudor. Probably best, then, to move along: we will return to verecundia, and its relation to pudor, after we have examined in detail just what pudor—a rather more complex entity—is about.\n\n\n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\n2 Fifty Ways to Feel Your Pudor\n\n“Do you see the people looking at you? Do you like that?” You will not find these questions, exactly, in any classical Latin text. I overheard them recently while waiting on line in Newark Airport, as they were addressed by a mother to her slightly bumptious three-year-old son. The mother’s tone made it clear—as clear to the boy as it was to an eavesdropper— that the questions were not being put in the spirit of disinterested inquiry: as she bent to meet her son at eye level, the scolding in her voice conveyed that the only acceptable answers were “yes” and “no,” in that order. Though the boy did not actually blush (so far as I recall), his downcast eyes and slightly protruding lower lip made two things plain: he felt his mother’s displeasure and disapproval, and if he had not known the right answers to the questions before, he knew them now. Watching this primal form of socialization so nakedly at work was exhilarating, if a bit queasy-making at the same time, rather like being witness to one’s own birth. Certainly I could only admire the economy of the job, done in a mere dozen words. The mother’s first question distilled—in “see” and “looking”—the double perception that gives rise to shame, your being aware of others being aware of you. Her second question condensed, in “like,” various forms of evaluation, desire, and feeling, all at once. Because it linked selfattention and the attention of others to the embodied experiences of restraint, shame, and regret, the second question was much the more important one in terms of the cultural work it was doing. That “no” was the only acceptable answer to the second question is eloquent of our uncomfortable relations with shame at this moment in Western history, when those who have good things to say about the emotion tend mostly to have in mind its use as an effective punishment (of scofflaws or the consumers of prostitution, for example), while others, especially in the therapeutic community, point mainly to its disfiguring effects on a private, privileged self.1 This is not a way of looking at things to which members of the Roman elite would have subscribed, for all that they regarded their version of shame— pudor—as primarily a “negative” emotion, experienced as a form of fear and discomfort. (Though various Romans remark that pudor can be unpleasant or inconvenient, none speaks of it as a “pathology.”) Being aware of others being \n\nFIFTY WAYS TO FEEL YOUR PUDOR\n\naware of you, though certainly not the whole of life, was a desirable part of it; while it was understandably your goal to receive the largest possible share of creditable attention (“honor”) and experience the least possible discomfort from discrediting attention (“shame”), honor and shame were experienced as complementary, rather than opposed.2 Those who did not have what we would call (in a now slightly archaic turn of phrase) a “sense of shame” could not expect to gain much honor; those who valued honor most highly could expect to experience shame most intensely. Understanding the varieties of that experience is our aim in this chapter. The variousness of pudor makes it a more complex emotion than the related but fairly straightforward affect of verecundia, considered in the preceding chapter, and this variousness requires a different, more complex approach. All experiences of pudor depend upon notions of personal worthiness (dignitas) and value (existimatio), which in turn derive from seeing my self being seen in creditable terms.3 I experience pudor when I see my self being seen as discredited, when the value that I or others grant that self is not what I would have it be. But though there are, accordingly, only two preconditions for my feeling pudor—that I have some sense of personal worthiness and value and that I see it being discounted—the ways in which I can see my value being discounted vary considerably, according to several different and fundamental criteria. For a coherent account of the emotion to be given, these ways and criteria must be brought into some sort of coherent relationship; but the simplest way of establishing such a relationship—through a straightforward narrative of linear “development”—is not available to us. While some experiences of pudor are more commonly spoken of than others, there is no historically recoverable reason to think that there was a single “original” or “authentic” or “real” form of the emotion from which the others emerged. Furthermore, for the reasons already discussed in the introduction to this book, attempting to analyze the various forms of pudor simply by matching them up with lexical equivalents in English (or any other language) would beg a host of questions and doom the project from the outset. Instead, we can best understand and represent the multiple forms of experience that cluster under the label of pudor by thinking of a variety of “scripts,” the little scenarios that we play out—as sequences of cause and effect, of perception, evaluation, and response—when we experience any emotion. Working with a complex of scripts, in this chapter and in each of the following, allows us to grasp the language of emotions in terms that are themselves emotion-neutral (and therefore not circular or otherwise problematic), by considering the emotions as they are defined in action and by examining, especially, the intentional states—the judgments, beliefs, and desires—that engage each of them. And, since stressing intentional states necessarily stresses the specifically cultural content of emotions, this approach most directly speaks to the concerns of this book. \n\nEMOTION, RESTRAINT, AND COMMUNITY IN ANCIENT ROME\n\nSo what script or scripts does a Roman who experiences pudor enact, what are the judgments and beliefs essential to the emotion, and what is their cultural content? To start to answer these questions, we can consider the partial taxonomy of pudor-scripts that appears as figure 2.1. I should stress that this taxonomy was not constructed a priori: I did not sit down and decide what a plausible taxonomy might look like, then try to sort the textual instances accordingly. The taxonomy was built inductively: these are just the consistent patterns that emerged from reading, at least two or three times each, every text in classical Latin in which pudor and its cognates occur and asking the question, What are the common threads in the stories that are told under the heading of pudor?4 After examining the taxonomy closely, to see how it is put together, we will draw out at least a few of the important ways in which these scripts of pudor interact in different social contexts, and we will give some attention to the different forms of “seeing” that give the emotion its life, before rounding off the chapter by bringing pudor into relation with its close kin, verecundia.\n\nSome Basic Structures By representing the pudor-scripts that were simultaneously active in Roman life, figure 2.1 allows the eye and mind to take them in all together, the better to appreciate their symmetries and cultural complementarities. Of course, this synoptic convenience has a cost, since it allows us to represent only the gross anatomy of the emotion. The taxonomy is “partial” in the sense that its ramifications could be pursued downward in finer-grain analysis: for example, each of the scripts could be further divided to distinguish the occurrent forms of pudor—the fully embodied experience of the emotion (compare our “feeling ashamed”)—from the dispositional forms—your habitual sensitivity to the emotion and your inclination to anticipate and avoid the circumstances in which you would experience its fully embodied form (compare our “sense of shame”).5 Because the basic structure of the underlying thought is the same in both forms, I have not represented the distinction, or others like it, though I will draw attention to them when they are relevant to the argument.6 With that qualification noted, we can go on to consider the taxonomy itself, which accounts for virtually all the evidence that offers a context sufficient to form a judgment and does not speak of pudor in unhelpfully general terms.7 The only exceptions fall into two very limited and inconsequential categories, which I set to one side as negligible. First, there are the settings where for a posey and often fatuous effect—a reductio ad absurdum or mere claptrap, for example—a speaker declares, as though it were a controversial notion, that he does not (or never will) feel pudor for something that in fact would not be expected to cause anyone to feel it. So, for example, the narrator \n\nUpon (or at the prospect of) seeing myself being seen in discreditable terms, I have an unpleasant psychophysical response,\n\nis not “up to me”\n\nis “up to me” and entails discreditable\n\n but is simply\n\nbut is\n\na “fact of life.”\n\n1\n\n“up to” another\n\nwho acts\n\nwith whom I am\n\ndirectly upon me.\n\nsomehow linked.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nF 2.1.

For example, when one old man remonstrating with another in a Plautine comedy sputters that “most people feel pudor when it’s of no consequence but are deserted by pudor when pudor ought to be felt, when it’s useful for them to feel pudor,” we might doubt that the statement is a reliable proposition about the behavior of “most people” in actual life and suspect that it was framed as it was to allow the accumulated “pud- talk” to give emphatic color to the remonstrances.9 Similarly, when the narrator of Lucan’s Civil War—striving for pathos and achieving bathos— claims that it causes pudor to mourn the deaths of individuals when “the whole world” is perishing, we can recognize a thought that was as ethically empty in antiquity as it would be today, and as worthy of the adolescent poet as the dull and pornographic catalog of mutilations that follows.10 If we start at the “top” of the taxonomy, then, we find both the cognition that gives the emotion its distinctive content—the belief that I am being seen (or risk being seen) in terms that discredit me, that lower the value ascribed to me as a person (existimatio)—and the psychophysical response that the cognition evokes, experienced as a kind of displeasure. If I have dispositional pudor— the inclination to experience the occurrent form that gives me a “sense of shame”—then my sensitivity to being seen in such terms will commonly lead me, through my imagination and “the very thought” of such discreditng, to experience the displeasure in anticipation, “as if”: a species of fear, not of physical punishment or the coercion of law but of a loss of worth that disfigures me in my own eyes or in the eyes of others (or both).11 If my dispositional pudor and the thoughts to which it gives rise do not restrain me sufficiently, I am liable to lay myself open to the occurrent emotion, which responds to the self’s disfigurement with (typically) a blush and some expressive use of the body, a posture or movement that signals a breaking off of contact with others: silence, downcast eyes, an averted glance, a turning away, or an actual withdrawal.12 At the next level of the taxonomy, we start to get at what the emotion is “about,” the behaviors or states of affairs sufficient to prompt the processes of body and mind just described, and we find the question from which the rest of the analysis follows: is the relevant behavior or state of affairs “up to me”? Is the pudor-circumstance the outcome of an act that I chose to perform (or not) and therefore something for which I am at least causally responsible? Here the taxonomy divides according to whether or not the act (though not neces\n\nFIFTY WAYS TO FEEL YOUR PUDOR\n\nsarily the outcome) was intentional, in the sense of being subject to my evaluations, judgments, and desires. Now, it might seem odd that this distinction should enter into the discussion at all, much less play so pivotal a role, given, for example, that a prominent ancient “philosophical” definition in which pudor figures tells us that it is “a fear of just criticism.”13 If that is true, then surely I can experience pudor only in respect of things that are up"
