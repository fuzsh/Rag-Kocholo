        "text": "Name: Shakera Buchanan\n\nPosition: Clinical Intervention Specialist\n\nWhat led you to your current position: I don’t feel as though I was led to this position, it was more like a calling. Growing up as a system impacted youth, I experienced and witnessed many flaws, wrongdoings and downright injustices towards youth that were impacted with mental health symptoms. Oftentimes, the treatment and care that was provided was insensitive, uncaring, and mundane. As I navigated my way through these systems, with the support of providers that really showed up for me, I was able to beat all odds and statistics that were “predestined” for me. I know firsthand how having access to quality mental health services, genuine care, and commitment, children and youth life trajectories can be altered. So here I am, doing the work!\n\nWhat inspires you to do this work: The resilience of the community that I serve. The resiliency in the children and families that I am privileged to work with. They have taught me so much about this work, far greater than I could have learned in any graduate program. My kiddos are amazing!\n\nWhat is a recent highlight you’ve experienced in the work or an important lesson you’ve learned in this role: This is my fourth year at my school site, and several students have been on my caseload for most of that time. Therapeutic rapport and trust have been solidified in relationship with these kiddos and their caregivers and as result, I have been able to really get to the heart of issues that brought them to services. I have so many rich, hearty and “aha” moments during sessions this school year. Without the prior work and time of building and strengthening trust in the relationship, these moments would not have occurred. Never underestimate the power of the therapeutic relationship.\n\nShare your life motto or something unique about yourself: This too shall pass! No matter how grim the circumstances may look, as long as there is breath in the body and a willingness to change, hope is possible and obtainable.\n\nOur clinicians at Elmhurst are taking a truly collaborative approach to providing services to students and families and we love to see it! Lilly Conboy and Adriana Camacho are teaming up to provide more holistic and equitable therapeutic services for a student and his family in a way that feels unique and supportive. Lilly started providing clinical services at Elmhurst United Middle School in Oakland, California in January 2022 where she began building her caseload of students in need of individual therapy. She began working with one particular middle schooler who had a variety of emotional and physical health needs. While she was able to build a connection with him, she struggled to establish clear and effective communication with his family as there was a language barrier. The family expressed a desire to work with a Spanish-speaking clinician if possible. Utilizing the support of translation services in order to collaborate with and support our families is a reality that many clinicians have to navigate.\n\n​\n\nWhen Adriana arrived at Elmhurst this past October as a second clinician on site, she was eager to support the students and families in this community. Adriana found that sharing a cultural connection with a family (both Adriana and this family identify as Mexican-American) can have a great therapeutic impact that goes beyond a common language and communication. Lilly and Adriana discovered an opportunity to collaborate around what this particular family was asking for to best meet their needs. Here was a family that really wanted to work with a Spanish-speaking clinician and a client (a middle schooler) in a different developmental state in which he was trying to become more independent and requesting his own therapist separate from the family therapist. How exciting that we were able to meet both the family’s needs and honor the client’s request to continue with his therapist that he had been building a good therapeutic relationship with! Lifting and integrating student and family voice is a big part of our program’s goal, and this collaborative therapeutic approach is aligned with that! Working to build a truly collaborative and holistic team of providers, Lilly and Adriana also partner with the medical center on campus to support this youth and family. We are so excited to see the wonderful work Lilly and Adriana are doing to jointly hold this client and family in a way that feels equitable and supportive!\n\nBlog Post Written By: Tiana Dudley, Director of School Partnerships ​\n\n“The tree is only as healthy as the root.” - @decolonizingtherapy\n\nAs we step into December, we get ready to end the Gregorian New Year, wrap up work with our clients and their families, and prepare for the holidays. We keep in mind ways to hold our clients and their families through the winter break. We often put ourselves on the back burner as we tend to others. We play multiple roles in our families (chosen or biological and sometimes both). We are the nurturers. We are the “listening ear.” We are the ones who hold compassion. We are the “understanding ones.” We are the givers. We can be challenged to give to ourselves what we generously offer to others – compassion, love, kindness and grace.\n\n​\n\nIn Audre Lorde’s collection of essays, “A Burst of Light,” she reclaims self-care as self-preservation and “an act of political warfare.” She invites us to tend to our hearts and soul – as means to heal. That is the essence of radical self-care. Inviting us to say “no” and re-prioritizing ourselves, which is crucial in order to continue doing our work. We’ve all been bombarded with “self-care activities” such as getting our “me time.” While that is a start, we must step further into the act of radical self-care in order to heal ourselves, those who were unable to heal in past generations and our seeds, so they carry a little less than we do in this lifetime. For example, for many first generation folx like myself, we tend to over-work and often hear family members telling us “Not be lazy” and not to take time off when we are really “not that sick.” Value is placed on working and taking a day off is considered a luxury. I invite folx to reclaim their time and deconstruct how this has shown up in their personal lives. As Audre Lorde reminds us, “it’s self-preservation.” I invite readers to deconstruct and challenge the narratives that have been passed down through generations and become societal norms.\n\nHere are some tips to consider as we get ready to take some needed rest:\n\nBe intentional – what does your heart and soul need?\n\nPractice self-compassion – don't measure your “productivity” on “how much” you get done. Be gentle with yourself. Maybe your body needed to just binge watch and not necessarily get “anything” done.\n\nTap into your joy. What makes you laugh? What makes you smile? Find one thing that taps into your joy and do it. Then do more of it.\n\nPlay music that makes your soul smile.\n\nTap into your creativity whether it’s drawing, painting, coloring mandalas, writing, acting etc.\n\nMove. Stretch. Dance. Spend time connecting with your body.\n\nSet time aside to unplug to tend to your soul.\n\nConnect with nature. Walk barefoot on grass, sit outside and let the sun kiss your face. Feel the breeze. Breathe.\n\nEat food that helps bring balance. Remember that foods like hummus, grapes, nuts and oranges help when feeling stressed.\n\nIncrease serotonin by practicing gratitude at the beginning and end of your day.\n\nThings To Stop Apologizing For (source: LinkedIN - Anonymous)\n\nAsking questions\n\nNot being available at all times.\n\nFeelings\n\nVocalizing your needs\n\nOutgrowing a place or situation.\n\nYour accomplishments\n\nNot looking “presentable”\n\nDoing things that make you happy.\n\nHaving boundaries.\n\n​Resources to consider:\n\n@selfloverainbow – will give you reminders on how to take care of your body, soul and heart.\n\n@thetappingsolution – it's a great resource on using tapping for anxiety and helping you sleep.\n\nSet up a monthly calendar of acts of self-care. Check out the calendar on Light the Change’s (LTC) monthly newsletter, “In the Kitchen.\"\n\nWhen all else seems too hard, maybe you just need a pep talk. Call (707) 873-7862 for a pep talk from some of our youngest teachers from K-6th grades from West Side Elementary School. AND above all, be kind to yourself and show yourselves some grace.\n\n​“It can be scary to rest. To slow down can feel terrifying. Also liberating. Be in your body. Intuit more. Breathe more. Tap on your energy centers more. Consciously & constantly clear your space. You are building a Growth map. One that leads to your best Self. This is magic too.” - @DrJennyJennM (Decolonizing Therapy)\n\n​\n\nBlog Post Written By: Karina Gonzalez, Clinical Supervisor\n\nThe Mosaic Outpatient School-Based Program has been in partnership with Hayward High School for nearly a full decade! Our current therapy team onsite includes Amber Keil, ASW, PPSC, Cristina Scott, Psy.D., and Julissa Navas, a clinical trainee from UC Berkeley who provides mental health services to students and families, including individual, group, and family therapy, as well as consultation and training to school staff and partners. Hayward High is rich with diversity and Hayward pride! The majority of students who attend Hayward High have a relative who also attended the school. We also have several school staff members who are alumni themselves. As such, the school has built strong relationships with families and the larger community, and it is a gift to us to be a part of it.\n\n​\n\nMosaic staff has had the unique opportunity of being at the forefront of developing the Coordination of Services Team, with one of our clinicians facilitating the meeting up until 2020. We also had the privilege of bringing many trauma-informed resources to support student and staff wellbeing in partnership with the Kaiser Permanente Resilience Initiative for many years. Our staff has also been part of a larger collaboration to expand social-emotional curriculum resources district wide. Currently, we work to provide key insight into our students emotional and behavioral needs as we navigate the ongoing trauma of the pandemic. This can include classroom and staff presentations, consultation meetings with staff, and presentations for caregivers. Last month, we participated in HUSD’s parent power sessions by facilitating a workshop for more than 25 Hayward caregivers on the topic of Parenting Through the Pandemic and Beyond.\n\n​\n\nThe words from a couple of our Hayward High School partners illustrate the quality of the partnership and collaboration we have created and deeply cherish:\n\n“Over the years it has been an invaluable program for our school, especially this year with the increase we have seen in anxiety, depression, and risk. Not just their counseling services, they have always gone above and beyond. They are reliable, dependable; it’s like a safety blanket knowing they are there. A lot comes up, and to have them available provides support and comfort knowing I can turn to them.”\n\n“Our Seneca partnership is a major part of our school community. They are always helpful with situations and with information needed to help serve our school community better. They are always willing to collaborate on finding new ways, including Tier 1 supports, to help students and staff receive mental health support.”\n\nWe truly feel part of the school community and we have always been warmly welcomed as part of the Farmer family. We are proud of the work we do here on The Farm!\n\nBlog Post Written By: Mosaic Outpatient Team\n\nThis year, Seneca has partnered withCommunity School for Creative Education (CSCE), a Waldorf public charter school located inthe San Antonio district of Oakland, California. CSCE serves TK-8th grade with approximately 200 students. CSCE’s mission is to provide a rigorous college-preparatory program integrated into a culturally rich, arts-infused, highly personalized curriculum inspired by Waldorf education for the diverse students of Oakland, to promote equity and prepare culturally competent, well-rounded, lifelong learners to lead, contribute to, and successfully participate in our rapidly changing multicultural society.\n\nThe Waldorf approach to education is an inclusive and holistic experience for all students, focusing on more than academics in hopes of providing students with the tools to navigate life. Staff work to understanding the developmental nature of the students as well as their lived experience both inside and outside of school. CSCE strives to be a vital community partner by cultivating robust connections for students and their families. CSCE’s core values are to take care of yourself, others, and space. Education for the hands, head, and heart enhances both social emotional and academic outcomes for all students. Similarly, Seneca’s Unconditional education (UE) model strives to provide opportunities for all students to be integrated into their greater school communities while working deliberately to close the immense educational opportunities and achievement gaps. Both the UE model and the Waldorf educational approach focuses on centering students and relationships.\n\n​\n\nCSCE chose to work in partnership with Seneca to boost overall culture and climate and to enrich their Coordination of Services Team (COST). In melding UE with the Waldorf approach, our work is to build consistent systems and structures, enhance CSCE’s relational approach to working with students, and to celebrate student and staff wins along the way. As in all of our partnerships, the work will be to support the school in integrating the behavioral, relational, and ecological approach to student support. This includes finding the balance between leveraging the power of individual relationships in support of student growth and development, while also creating a level of predictability and consistency in school-wide expectations for behavior and behavioral supports. All of this work is in support of creating a trauma-informed, and healing-centered learning environment where students, staff, and families feel safe, seen, and empowered to be their most authentic selves.\n\nBlog Post Written By: Devina Brooks, Director of School Partnerships"
