        "text": "Overview\n\nJon Philipson is a litigator and counselor who represents both national and regional business entities in complex business disputes in federal and state trial and appellate courts. He advises and guides clients concerning a wide range of topics, including contract disputes, business negotiations, employment disputes, antitrust disputes, shareholder derivative actions, defamation claims and First Amendment issues. Jon often serves as local counsel for businesses pursuing and defending actions in Florida state and Federal courts, particularly the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. In addition, Jon is a Florida Supreme Court certified circuit civil mediator and certified Middle District of Florida mediator and a court approved arbitrator for Florida’s 6th, 12th, and 13th Judicial Circuits.\n\nHis work also involves drafting, negotiating, and analyzing agreements, written consents, and other corporate operating and formation documents for small to large business entities. In addition, he counsels clients on business transactions, antitrust issues, and potential litigation.\n\nJon seeks to be an exceptionally informed advisor to his clients. First in his law school class, editor in chief of the law review, and a Rhodes Scholar finalist, Jon’s approach to the day-to-day practice of law is based on exhaustive research, a voracious appetite for details, and a relentless focus on the client’s ultimate objective. As a result, he can deliver solutions that are not only legally correct but also pragmatic.\n\nGrowing up in his family’s multigenerational business, Jon immersed himself in the day-to-day realities of operating an enterprise. From that experience, Jon takes a proactive problem-solving approach to his clients’ legal matters.\n\nAs a practitioner, Jon assists clients in arriving at resolutions by applying a multifaceted perspective that reflects the diversity of his professional and personal background. Although he is a highly effective advocate in court, his problem-solving approach comes into play outside the courtroom, in analyzing, negotiating and developing solutions to his clients’ disputes and issues.\n\nPrior to attending law school, Jon was involved in public service at both the national and state level. This included working as an aide to Congressman Jim Davis, serving as a press intern for U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and drafting state legislation in Florida.\n\nIn addition, following law school, Jon both externed and clerked for Chief Judge Anne Conway, of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. In this role, he worked closely with the judge, assisting with the drafting of opinions and memoranda, researching a wide range of legal topics and preparing jury instructions. In addition to being highly sought-after, federal judicial clerkships provide clerks with unique insights into the judicial process.\n\nJon seeks to integrate all of these factors into his representation and guidance of clients. When presented with a dispute or an issue, in addition to legal analysis, he also is capable of providing strategic analysis of the political, public relations, and business impact of potential courses of action. This multifactorial approach enables him to recommend a course of action that’s optimal from several perspectives. He often operates as a kind of outside general counsel for clients large and small and for individuals, advising them on a wide variety of issues and concerns in this manner. Jon also employs this approach when serving as a mediator and arbitrator.\n\nRepresentative Matters\n\nRepresented multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate and serving as local trial counsel, obtained a bench trial decision involving a disability discrimination claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nRepresented international animal rights organization in ongoing litigation.\n\nRepresented closely held corporations and limited liability companies in derivative and direct disputes and records inspections.\n\nResolved breach of contract disputes on matters involving airplane leases, employment disputes, commercial loan disputes, shopping center disputes, Medicare Management Services Organization dispute, multimillion-dollar earnout disputes, subcontract agreements.\n\nRepresented media entities and journalists in defamation matters in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nRepresented and advised employers in employment disputes and EEOC proceedings and pre-suit proceedings.\n\nAdvised corporation and trade association on possible antitrust claims.\n\nCounsel closely-held businesses on various day-to-day legal issues and corporate management, including review and analysis of existing contracts and post-transaction analysis.\n\nEvaluate for clients possible high-priced insurance claims.\n\nAdvised national corporations on strategic messaging and risk management assessments and strategies involving various business initiatives and legal risks.\n\nObtained a dismissal with prejudice of a libel suit brought against a civil rights lawyer and his publisher arising out of the lawyer’s prominent book on social issues.\n\nWon summary judgment for reporter in public official defamation lawsuit brought by a former state attorney.\n\nObtained, as local counsel, a dismissal with prejudice of tort claims against an Internet service provider based on Section 230 immunity\n\nOn behalf of a consortium of media companies, obtained the release of surveillance video recordings over asserted exemptions in a high-profile criminal case.\n\nObtained order granting protective order and fees to preclude depositions of employees that were beyond the scope of discovery in a class action case.\n\nWon dismissal of copyright claims and state law claims under the Florida Idea statute of frauds.\n\nObtained summary judgment in favor of Directors & Officers Liability carrier in a $40 million-plus Coblentz enforcement action involving the application of an “arising out of” contract liability exclusion to a business dispute and a discussion of the Daubert deficiencies of a Coblentz expert opinion\n\nRepresented a contractor in a high-profile OSHA investigation.\n\nRepresented insurance companies in multimillion-dollar coverage disputes.\n\nRepresented media companies and public interest groups in Florida public records actions.\n\nProvided trademark policing for clients.\n\nHonors\n\nAV Preeminent rating as independently determined by Martindale-Hubbell, 2019-present\n\nBest Lawyers in America, Commercial Litigation, 2021-present\n\nTampa Jewish Community Centers & Federation’s Charles Adler Young Leadership Award, 2023\n\nFederal Bar Association, Tampa Bay Chapter’s Mentor of the Year, 2021 & 2022\n\nTampa Magazine Top Lawyers, Top Three Lawyers in Commercial Litigation & Transactions/UCC Law, 2019\n\nSuper Lawyers: Florida Rising Stars, 2017-2021\n\nUniversity of Florida Alumni Association: Twenty Under Thirty List, 2013\n\nAmerican Bar Association’s James Boskey Award, 2011\n\nUniversity of Florida Hall of Fame, 2011\n\nFlorida Blue Key Officer\n\nEditor in Chief, Florida Law Review\n\nW.D.
