        "text": "Located in Amherst, Massachusetts, a town of 35,000 people in the western part of the state, Amherst College’s 1,000-acre campus is adjacent to downtown Amherst. Our college sits within the homeland of the Nonotuck people and also in the Kwinitekw valley, a crossroads of multiple Native nations. The indigenous nations in the region that continue to have an ongoing presence here include the Nipmuc, Wampanoag, Massachusett, and Narragansett to the east; the Mohegan, Pequot, and Schaghticoke to the south; the Mohican and Haudenosaunee (Confederacy) to the west; and the Wabanaki (or Abenaki) to the north. Since its founding in 1821, Amherst College has earned a reputation as one of the finest liberal arts colleges in the nation, enrolling 1,850 talented, energetic, and diverse young scholars. Diversity, defined in its broadest sense, is fundamental to Amherst’s mission. The college enrolls students from nearly every state and from more than 50 countries, and more than 45% of Amherst’s students identify as students of color. Amherst has an active Native and Indigenous Students Association on campus, a Five-College Certificate program in Native American Studies headed by one of our Native faculty persons, and the College’s Frost Library is home to the Pablo Eisenberg Collection of Native American Literature. Amherst also has an Early Opportunity for Native Students (EONS) program as part of the Access to Amherst (A2A) program for prospective students to learn more about the Amherst experience.\n\nAmherst is one of the few completely need-blind colleges; students are admitted without regard to financial need, and each admitted student is guaranteed financial aid equal to 100% of demonstrated financial need, with no required student loan component. Reflecting an institutional commitment to access, Amherst’s student body is among the most economically diverse of its peer colleges and universities. With its student-faculty ratio of 7-to-1, and its open curriculum (there are no area or distribution requirements), Amherst allows each student — with the help of faculty advisers — to chart an individual path through the more than 800 courses offered at the college and the more than 5,000 courses available through Amherst’s membership in the Five College Consortium.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.amherst.edu/admission\n\nFinancial Aid: https://www.amherst.edu/admission/visit\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://www.amherst.edu/admission/visit\n\nHow to Apply: https://www.amherst.edu/admission/apply\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.amherst.edu/admission/diversity\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.amherst.edu/admission/covid-19-considerations\n\nA historically women’s college, Barnard College is located in New York City in the Manhattan borough, a region originally named Manahatta by the Lenape people. Established as Columbia University’s sister college in 1889, Barnard College was founded on Lenapehoking during continued land dispossession and forced removal of the Lenape. We respectfully acknowledge all Native peoples – past, present, and future – for their fundamental and continued relationships with the region.

Bowdoin is in Brunswick, Maine, which is in the traditional territory of the Wabanaki Confederacy. We recognize and honor the current Tribes who comprise the Wabanaki Confederacy—the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Micmac peoples—who have stewarded this land throughout the generations. We respect the traditional values of these Tribes and acknowledge their inherent sovereignty in this territory.\n\nStudy at Bowdoin leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree in one of over 55 departmental and interdisciplinary majors. With an average class size of 16, students work closely with faculty beginning in their first year. Bowdoin was founded and endowed in service of the common good, a cherished core value that guides how, and what, we choose to study, who we attract and admit, and how we treat each other. Forty percent of the incoming class identify as students of color and seventeen percent of the incoming class are the first in their family to attend college. Our Native American Student Association (NASA) creates and maintains a supportive environment for Native American students at Bowdoin and collaborates with the four tribes in the state of Maine.\n\nWhile Bowdoin’s application process is highly selective, submission of test scores is optional. Admissions is need-blind, and we meet full demonstrated need of all admitted students with grants—not loans. Bowdoin’s application fee is waived for first-generation-to-college students and/or any student applying for financial aid. The admissions office hosts over 100 students during fly-in programs held every fall.\n\nWe know that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious disruptions to students’ school years. Our focus is on adapting our process and evaluations to your circumstances during this crisis and will evaluate transcripts and applications accordingly.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/costs-and-aid/index.html\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/visit/index.html\n\nHow to Apply: https://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/apply/index.html\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/visit/explore-bowdoin/index.html\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.bowdoin.edu/covid-19/index.html\n\nBrown University was founded in 1764 and is located in historic Providence, Rhode Island, which is the ancestral homeland of the Narragansett Indian Tribe. Brown is a private, Ivy League institution recognized for its global reach, vibrant community, expansive research opportunities and unique curriculum. The Open Curriculum gives students both choice and freedom in developing their undergraduate course of study by featuring interdisciplinary seminars, more than 80 concentrations (or “majors”), and over 2,000 courses (including cross-registration at the Rhode Island School of Design). Additionally, our innovative Open Curriculum has no curricular requirements outside of the writing and concentration requirements. Brown’s commitment to access and equity resulted in the implementation of our Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, which included the promise to double the faculty of color, increase resources for historically underrepresented groups on campus, and to host College Horizons for the first time in Brown’s history. Brown also launched the Native and Indigenous Studies Initiative to promote the scholarship of faculty and students that “explores, and increases the understanding of, the cultural traditions and political experiences of Indigenous Peoples (especially in the Western Hemisphere) through historical and contemporary lenses.” This past year, we welcomed our inaugural Tribal Community Member in Residence, Dr. Karen Craddock (Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah). The Native Americans at Brown (NAB) student group also organizes an ongoing Native American Heritage Series and the annual Spring Thaw Powwow, which is attended by over 1,000 people from throughout New England. The Brown Promise Financial Aid program meets 100% of demonstrated need and all students receiving financial aid do not have student loans in their financial aid packages.\n\nAdmissions: https://admission.brown.edu/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://admission.brown.edu/tuition-aid\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://admission.brown.edu/visit/campus-tours-0\n\nHow to Apply: https://admission.brown.edu/first-year\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.brown.edu/academics/native-american-and-indigenous-studies/native-american-and-indigenous-studies\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://healthy.brown.edu/\n\nBryn Mawr is a top women’s liberal arts college, located on a stunning residential campus just twelve miles outside Philadelphia. In our College’s land acknowledgement, we openly recognize the Lenape Indian tribe as the original inhabitants of eastern Pennsylvania. We acknowledge the Lenape people as the indigenous stewards of their homelands and also the spiritual keepers of the Lenape Sippu, or Delaware River, and we do hereby commit to actively supporting our Lenape siblings in whatever way we are able, helping to maintain the cultural identity of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and southern New York.\n\nAt Bryn Mawr, we cultivate a space where female expertise, achievement and leadership is the norm, not the exception.

We honor with gratitude the people who’ve stewarded the land through the generations and their ongoing contributions to this region. We acknowledge the ongoing injustices that we have committed against the Dakota Nation, and we wish to interrupt this legacy, beginning with acts of healing and honest storytelling about this place.\n\nCarleton is one of the nation’s top liberal arts and sciences colleges, known for its bright students and intellectual faculty committed to teaching. Carleton has several qualities that make it distinctive: 1. We use a trimester system—this means fast-paced learning during three 10-week terms taking 3 classes at a time. The trimester system allows for lots of flexibility in your scheduling, and lots of academic exploration. 2.Over 70% of our students participate in at least one off-campus studies program. Any financial aid that you receive at Carleton will follow you around the world, making study abroad affordable for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds. 3.

In recognizing the land upon which CWRU resides, the university expresses our gratitude and appreciation to those who lived and worked here before us; those whose stewardship and resilient spirit makes CWRU’s residence possible on this traditional homeland of the Lenape (Delaware), Shawnee, Wyandot Miami, Ottawa, Potawatomi, and other Great Lakes tribes (Chippewa, Kickapoo, Wea, Piankishaw, and Kaskaskia). CWRU also acknowledges the thousands of Native Americans who now call Northeast Ohio home.\n\nCase Western Reserve offers 5,700+ undergraduate students high-impact experience-based education across each of our four schools: Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Management and Nursing. Our residential campus is situated in the cultural district of the city (recognized as the #1 arts district in the country by USA Today), four miles from downtown with ready access to internships, neighborhoods, professional sports, and social and recreation opportunities. Students benefit from research experiences with faculty, high-quality internship and study abroad opportunities, and access to world-class neighboring institutions including Cleveland Clinic, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\nAs a diverse and welcoming campus, Case Western Reserve works to develop an inclusive community that supports all students, respects and celebrates their identities and facilitates their success. Professionals advocate for our students and guide them to their goals through an identity-informed lens in offices including, but not limited to, the Office of Multicultural Affairs, Flora Stone Mather Center for Women, and LGBT Center.\n\nCWRU is test-optional for students entering through fall 2024. In addition, we provide a variety of merit scholarships and need-based aid and meet 100% of demonstrated need for all admitted students.\n\nColgate University as well as the township of Hamilton, NY are built upon traditional Oneida lands. These lands were seized as part of the Treaty of Fort Schuyler in 1788, under the guise of protecting the lands from speculators (McLester & Hauptman, 42). The Oneida were among America’s first allies in the Revolutionary War, the only Nation of the Confederacy to do so. Learn more about our acknowledgement of the land Colgate University occupies.\n\nColgate is a distinctive, leading American university known for its intellectual rigor, world-class professors, campus of stunning beauty, and alumni famously loyal to their alma mater. At the core of Colgate University is one of the most ambitious and relevant learning experiences in the country. Regardless of major, all students are taught to think critically, communicate powerfully, analyze other perspectives, and solve complex problems. This foundational curriculum equips students to develop as leaders who can engage thoughtfully and flourish in the careers that they want.\n\nColgate’s scale is unlike any in America. We are small enough for students to build relationships with their professors, yet large enough to support top scholars in every field. We offer a surprisingly vast array of classes and majors. Undergraduates in every major undertake serious research here. Off-campus and international study options prevail, and all our classes are taught by leading scholars in their fields. At Colgate, teaching is a clear priority.\n\nThe energy of this place is everywhere. We compete in Division I athletics, the highest level of collegiate sports. We have designed our residential living to ensure that students from all over the world feel connected and share experiences on a campus that quickly feels like home. It is our mission to develop thinkers who value intellectual rigor and who are capable of challenging themselves and others with vigor and reason. This is Colgate, a distinctive, vibrant, and welcoming place to learn, live, and develop into who you are. Colgate is ever driven to be the best — one of the world’s premier universities and the finest undergraduate institution in America.\n\nColorado College (CC) is located within the unceded territory of the Ute People and recognizes the complex histories of labor and living on this land. Colorado College honors the Ancestors of various peoples, tribes, nations, and families whose struggle for justice on this land inspires our daily work.\n\nThe Indigenous community at CC includes students, staff, and faculty with engagement beyond campus and throughout Colorado Springs and the Southwest. Native American Student Union is one of the most active clubs on campus having hosted their annual Pow Wow since 1991. CC’s Elder In Residence and the Revitalizing Nations Living & Learning Community support native students and bring awareness of indigenous identities to campus. Our Indigenous Speaker Series and Visiting Writer Series brings elders, historians, scholars and respected voices from tribal communities from across North America. Southwest Studies, Indigenous Studies and Race Ethnicity Migration Studies are academic concentrations with strong emphasis on native culture, land, history and research.\n\nSince 1874, students at Colorado College have attended class in the shadow of Pike’s Peak (known to the Ute as Tava). Located approximately 70 miles south of Denver in Colorado Springs, CC is known for the “Block Plan”, a unique academic schedule allowing students to focus on just one class every 3 ½ weeks rather than balancing several courses throughout one semester. Students dive deep into subjects, with each block covering the same amount of material as a course on the semester system. The benefits? You can study immigration policy on the borderlands, find Jupiter during evening labs in Barnes Observatory, or traverse the natural wonders of the Southwest as a field archaeologist. After each block comes the “block break”, a 4 ½ day hiatus from classes. Students take full advantage of both the college’s campus activities and the surrounding Rocky Mountains, returning to their next class refreshed and excited.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/financialaid/\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://www.coloradocollege.edu/#virtualtour\n\nHow to Apply: https://www.coloradocollege.edu/admission/for-students/start-my-app/index.html\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/indigenous-community/\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/coronavirus/\n\nColumbia University is located in New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, which means island of many hills in the language of the Lenni Lenape people.

Students enjoy a dynamic combination of tradition and innovation, opportunities to participate in state-of-the-art research, robust extracurricular activities, and a diverse student body.\n\nLocated in the heart of the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Duke draws students from all over the United States and 85 foreign countries, representing a range of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The 6,900 undergraduates can choose from 53 majors in the arts and sciences and engineering, 52 minors, and 27 interdisciplinary certificate programs, or arts and sciences students can work with a faculty member to design their own curriculum. Duke’s financial aid program meets full financial need for all admitted students who apply for aid, regardless of citizenship or residency.\n\nDuke has an active Native American Student Alliance organization, a Native American Sorority Chapter and each April provides a fly-in program for eligible admitted Native students during Duke “Blue Devil Days”.\n\nAdmissions: https://admissions.duke.edu/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://financialaid.duke.edu/\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://admissions.duke.edu/visit/\n\nHow to Apply: https://admissions.duke.edu/apply/\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://dukegroups.com/nasa/\n\nhttps://studentaffairs.duke.edu/cma\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://coronavirus.duke.edu/\n\nEmory was founded in 1836 on the historic lands of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, 15 years after the First Treaty of Indian Springs (1821) dispossessed the Muscogee of land including both Emory campus locations. We also acknowledge that Emory University’s founders were slaveholders, and the Oxford campus was originally constructed by enslaved people. To these peoples and their descendants, we acknowledge the grave injustices inflicted on them, and we recognize the indelible mark of their labor on the creation of the university. It is a liberal arts and research university located in Atlanta, Georgia. Students can choose from 80+ majors, including dance, economics, history, business, nursing, and quantitative sciences, or create an academic plan unique to your career goals Nearly half of our students choose to double major. All first-year students enroll in the First-Year at Emory Program, offering students unique academic programming taught in small classes of 19 or fewer students, as well as social events, helping students acclimate to campus. Classes are taught by leading faculty in their fields, and advisors are faculty familiar with your program. Beyond the classroom, internships, study abroad, and research opportunities abound as well! With over 450 student clubs, sports teams, and performing arts groups – and our unusual and fun traditions – Emory is a great place for students who want to organize, lead, and be a part of it all. Oxford Olympics is an annual tournament during Orientation week where the residence halls compete for the championship. Atlanta is the business, healthcare, and cultural capital of the Southeast, where you can take advantage of over 2,000 internship opportunities. Study breaks are for soaking in the art scene and diverse dining options, or retreating into nature by kayaking or hiking local nature trails.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.emory.edu/home/admission/undergraduate.html\n\nFinancial Aid: https://apply.emory.edu/financial-aid/index.html\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://apply.emory.edu/discover/visitengagement.html\n\nHow to Apply: https://apply.emory.edu/apply/first-year/index.html\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/nae/\n\nhttp://native.emory.edu/\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.emory.edu/forward/covid-19/dashboard/index.html\n\nFort Lewis College is situated upon the ancestral land of the Nuuchiu (Ute) people who were forcibly removed by the United States Government. We acknowledge that this land is connected to the communal and ceremonial spaces of the Jicarilla Abache (Apache), Pueblos of New Mexico, Hopi Sinom, and Diné (Navajo) Nations. It is important to acknowledge this because the narratives of the lands in this region have long been told from dominant perspectives, without full recognition of the original land stewards who continue to inhabit and connect with this land.\n\nFort Lewis College (FLC) is a four-year public liberal arts college located in Durango, Colorado. FLC has a population of 3,443 students and offers 55 majors. Students come to FLC from all 50 states, 12 countries, and over 185 Native American Tribes and Alaska Native Villages. 42% of our students identify as Native American or Alaska Native, and 58% identify as students of color, making FLC incredibly diverse! 46% of students are first-generation and 34% are Pell-eligible. We have a student to faculty ratio of 14:1, with an average class size of 21 students. FLC has a Native American Center and over 10 Native American and Alaskan Native clubs for students to join. The Hozhoni Days Powwow is FLC’s longest-running cultural celebration, which began in 1966.\n\nBefore becoming a college, Fort Lewis was a U.S. military post and later became a non-reservation federal Indian boarding school, operating from 1892 to 1910. In 1911, Fort Lewis became a high school, then a two-year college. In 1956, Fort Lewis transformed yet again into a four-year college. Today, FLC offers the Native American Tuition Waiver for enrolled members or children of an enrolled member of a federally recognized Native American Tribe or Alaska Native Village to attend FLC tuition-free.\n\nHamilton College was originally founded in 1793 by the Rev. Samuel Kirkland as the Hamilton-Oneida Academy, a school where the children of the native Oneida Indians and those of the white settlers streaming into the region following the Revolutionary War could be educated together. Kirkland presented his plan to George Washington who “expressed approbation” and to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton who lent his name and consented to be a trustee. At his request, Oneida Chief Skenandoa is buried alongside his friend Kirkland in the College cemetery. Today, Hamilton is one of the nation’s most highly regarded liberal arts colleges, enrolling 1,850 students from nearly all 50 states and 45 countries. Consistent with its reputation as a “college of opportunity,” Hamilton is need-blind in its admission decisions and promises to meet the full demonstrated need of admitted students for all four years. Hamilton offers a personal approach to educating its students highlighted by an open curriculum (no core courses or distribution requirements), individualized advising with a professor, 56 areas of study, classes that average 14 students each, and a 9-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio. The Hamilton community welcomes and embraces students from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Twenty-nine percent of the student body consists of students of color or international students, and 15 percent of our students are the first in their family to attend college. There are more than 200 community service, cultural, musical, athletic, political, social, recreational and religious groups on campus. At Hamilton, the quality of personal interaction that takes place in our classrooms, laboratories, studios and performance halls extends to our residences, dining halls, sporting venues, and to the casual conversations that take place whenever two or more people encounter one another.\n\nWeb: Admission | Financial Aid | Our Diverse Community\n\nWe want to begin by naming that we are on unceded Pocumtuc land. We understand that naming this is not enough – we’re doing this as a way of acknowledging and reminding ourselves about the land we occupy, and we know this act alone does not repair the damage done by colonialism. We want to acknowledge the Pocumtuc people, the original inhabitants of the land where we live and work, and the land that Hampshire College is on.\n\nHampshire College is a small, independent, coeducational liberal arts college located on 800 acres of open and wooded land in Amherst, Massachusetts. The College serves as an academic home to approximately 500 students from 35 U.S. states and ten countries. As of 2022, approximately 30% of our students identify as first-generation.\n\nAt Hampshire, faculty advisors assist students in creating a customized course of study to address questions, challenges, or issues of interest. In lieu of grades, academic performance is assessed with constructive, written feedback on students’ projects, writing, and engagement in classes and community.\n\nHampshire College is part of the Five College Consortium with Amherst, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Students at each campus can cross register for classes, join clubs, try out for club sports and performing arts groups, borrow books, and embed themselves in the cultures of other schools.\n\nThe Harvard College Admissions Office acknowledges that the land on which the University sits is the traditional territory of the Massachusett people and is a place which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange among nations. Harvard’s early mission included the Harvard Indian College, opened in 1655. This work is now taken up by the Harvard University Native American Program (HUNAP). Harvard is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with an undergraduate student body of 6,600 students. These students hail from all 50 states, over 100 different countries and represent many different socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. Students can choose from over 3,700 courses each year. Among these are several opportunities to take classes and conduct research in various fields with indigenous-focused content. Students can concentrate, or major, in 50 different areas of study spanning the humanities, social sciences, physical sciences, engineering sciences, as well as several interdisciplinary majors. In addition, extracurricular activities play a large role on campus with over 450 different student-run groups, including several Native organizations. The way in which the Harvard community comes together to advance its mission has been shaped by the past year. Due to the efforts and insights of the Harvard community, the college is prepared for the path forward, and returning to campus in the fall.\n\nHarvard is committed to offering comprehensive financial aid to all students with demonstrated financial need. Students choosing to apply by the Early Action deadline must apply by November 1, and students choosing to apply by the Regular Action deadline must apply by January 1. Students will be able to apply for admission without ACT or SAT test results for the 2021-2022 application cycle.

The campuses are located in Claremont, CA on the ancestral land of the Tongva people. Across as many as 100 villages, the Tongva occupied much of the Los Angeles basin. They were rich in a diversity of natural resources from across the multiple ecological zones of the area. They honored the land and believed in a reciprocal relationship of respect and care among humans, animals, plants and land. As of just a few years ago, there were almost 4,000 people that identified as Tongva or having Tongva ancestry.\n\nHarvey Mudd offers a rigorous math and science education in a broader liberal arts context, which gives our students the skills and knowledge to solve demanding technical problems and the ability to communicate clearly, work in teams and think across disciplines. Harvey Mudd offers 10 majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and unparalleled access to world-class research. Research may start in the first year, and all students complete a senior thesis or participate in the Clinic Program.\n\nOutside of the classroom, Harvey Mudd’s 900 undergraduates grow together in an atmosphere of collaboration, trust and support. 98% of students live on campus for four years, and students have access to over 60 clubs and organizations plus hundreds more across The Claremont Colleges. These include cultural and identity-based groups that are supported by Harvey Mudd’s Office of Institutional Diversity.\n\nHarvey Mudd meets 100% of demonstrated financial need for admitted students and are need-blind for all U.S. citizens and permanent residents. 44% of current students receive need-based financial aid, and Harvey Mudd also offers merit scholarships. Visit Financial Aid at Harvey Mudd for more information including Harvey Mudd’s Net Price Calculator.\n\nHaverford College, located just outside Philadelphia, PA, occupies and was founded upon the ancestral land of the Lenni Lenape people whose presence and resilience in Pennsylvania continues to this day. Haverford is a place where students are trusted, have the opportunity to shape their own path, and have a profound impact on the overall community experience. Haverford students conduct research with faculty who are internationally recognized thought-leaders. Students supplement their classroom experience with experiential learning opportunities supported and funded through our three Academic Centers. All Haverford students will conduct their own graduate-level research as part of their senior thesis. Students are trusted to manage the $500,000 student activities budget, serve on college-wide hiring committees, and run more than 145 clubs and organizations. Of course, the clearest example of the trust placed in students can be found in Haverford’s student-run Honor Code. The Honor Code at Haverford, among other benefits, allows our students the freedom to self-schedule unproctored exams and access labs 24 hours a day.\n\nThe close proximity to other colleges and universities has fostered an active consortium. Haverford, Bryn Mawr, and Swarthmore Colleges together comprise the Tri-College Consortium. Students can register for classes across the three schools, and any social event within the Tri-Co is open to and offered at no cost to the entire Tri-Co community. The University of Pennsylvania partners with Haverford on accelerated Master’s Degree programs in engineering, bioethics, and city planning.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.haverford.edu/admission\n\nFinancial Aid: https://www.haverford.edu/financial-aid\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://admission.haverford.edu/portal/virtual_events\n\nHow to Apply: https://www.haverford.edu/admission/applying\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.haverford.edu/admission/access-diversity-inclusion\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.haverford.edu/be-safe\n\nJohns Hopkins University is a place where ambitious, talented, and creative students thrive. Students in all majors learn through exploration and discovery—both inside and outside the classroom at JHU, which was founded as the first American research institution. With no core curriculum, Hopkins offers students the freedom to pursue classes they’re interested in, not just required to take. Students are able—and encouraged—to build the academic path that is right for them, with guidance from staff and advisers. Double majoring and minoring or taking classes across disciplines are common practices, with 60 percent of students pursuing a double major or major/minor. Hopkins has a close-knit feel (on average, there are fewer than 20 students in 74% of classes and a 7:1 student-faculty ratio) and the resources of a large research university, so students have the opportunity to learn from esteemed faculty and participate in experiences usually reserved for grad students or professionals. In fact, 97% of students have at least one career-related experience as undergraduates through research, internships, or other pre-professional opportunities. Studying abroad is also a common option, with 500 students studying abroad and engaging in research each year in more than forty countries. Outside of the classroom, students are active and engaged on a lively campus, and are involved in activities from cultural and performing arts groups to advocacy and service organizations, including ISH, the Indigenous Students at Hopkins student organization. Baltimore, Maryland is an extension of campus—a bustling city with a small town feel that is a gateway to internships and jobs, and an entertainment hot spot. The admissions committee approaches applications from a holistic perspective, evaluating the ‘whole student.’ In addition to looking at a student’s academic achievement and intellectual curiosity, we seek to admit students who are excited about learning and living at Johns Hopkins. We look for students who will bring something to the campus community while taking advantage of all Hopkins has to offer, by collaborating with their peers and faculty mentors to pursue groundbreaking discoveries. JHU is need-blind, meets 100% of demonstrated need, and offers no-loan financial aid packages. Students who are primed to thrive on a campus where diversity of thought drives our academic culture shouldn’t be limited by their family’s ability to pay. With the potential to graduate debt-free, equipped with an education that opens doors, our students have the freedom to boldly explore ways to apply their knowledge and talents. Johns Hopkins is adopting a 1-year test-optional policy for the Class of 2026 (students applying for entry in the fall of 2022).\n\nAdmissions: https://apply.jhu.edu/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://finaid.jhu.edu/\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://apply.jhu.edu/visit-hopkins/\n\nHow to Apply: https://apply.jhu.edu/application-process/\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/oma/\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://covidinfo.jhu.edu/information-for-undergraduate-students/\n\nLawrence University’s Appleton and Door County, Wisconsin campuses are located on the ancestral homelands of the Menominee Nation.

We honor the Dakota people as well as the land itself.\n\nAt Macalester College, students experience the best of both worlds—the inspiring academic program of a liberal arts and sciences education, combined with the energy and opportunities of the Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nAcademics are ranked among the top 20 in the U.S., with small classes, individual attention, and collaboration serving as the pillars of the student experience. Students work side by side with professors—in the classroom, in the lab, on stage, on study away, or in more than 60 courses offered each year that partner with Twin Cities’ organizations and businesses. From first-year to capstone courses, intellectual exploration is the foundation of a Macalester education.\n\nMacalester draws students from every corner of the globe. With nearly 2,100 students coming from 98 countries and all 50 states, students find richer discussions and a deeper understanding of the world through experiences in and outside the classroom. Contributing to lasting friendships and a sense of community, there are over 100 student organizations where students enjoy shared interests, express their identity, and expand their talents.\n\nInternationalism, multiculturalism, and service to society are the values which shape Macalester’s campus culture, empowering students to create positive change and make a difference in the world. The United Nations flag has flown on campus since 1950 and student-led social movements have been happening since the 1960s, symbols of Macalester’s commitment to a curriculum and way of life made stronger through diversity.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.macalester.edu/admissions/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://www.macalester.edu/admissions/financial-aid/\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://admissions.macalester.edu/portal/virtual_info_tour\n\nHow to Apply: https://www.macalester.edu/admissions/apply/\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.macalester.edu/admissions/diversity-and-inclusion/\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.macalester.edu/covid-19/\n\nMIT is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which we acknowledge as the territory of the Wampanoag Nation.

Combining excellence in science and engineering with a world-class education in the humanities and arts, an MIT education provides the tools for solving the challenges of our generation and beyond. The MIT community loves to speak in numbers. Students say things like, “I have 6.001 in 10-250 at 2:30, then my Course 9 UROP in Building 46.” MIT has a diverse, engaged, creative, and intense student body, with an 8:1 student-faculty ratio. Students are active in athletics, undergraduate organizations (MIT has over 500, including the Laboratory for Chocolate Science), and residential communities (MIT has 10 dorms, 2 of which allow cats). There are many resources and people who can help students on their journey. Academic deans, professors, upperclassmen mentors, faculty advisors and house leaders, and graduate resident tutors are all here to help students navigate the MIT experience and find a home here. The MIT Chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) is a student-run group that promotes Native culture and community on campus and STEM-related education to various tribal communities.

The Western Abenaki are the traditional caretakers of these Vermont lands and waters, which they call Ndakinna, or “homeland.” We remember their connection to this region and the hardships they continue to endure.\n\nAt Middlebury, we are committed to educating students in the tradition of the liberal arts. We encourage our students to be knowledgeable in a wide range of disciplines, from our scientifically and mathematically oriented majors, to the arts and humanities. With approximately 2800 undergraduate students, a 9:1 student to faculty ratio, and average class size of 16 students, Middlebury academics allows students to form close connections with their professors, peers, and the subject matter being taught. As the college with the oldest Environmental Studies program in the United States, Middlebury is committed to integrating sustainability into all aspects of our institution, from the classroom to residential life. Additionally, Middlebury’s commitment to a global education takes many forms, whether through it be through our immersive language programs, one of our 36 schools abroad, or class offerings at our graduate Institute of International Studies in Monterrey. Finally, Middlebury is dedicated to creating a diverse and welcoming community with full and equal participation for all individuals and groups. Our Anderson-Freeman Resource Center is one of several spaces on campus that supports student well-being and success. The AFC serves students from historically marginalized populations in higher education by providing pre-orientation programming, mentorship opportunities, and workshops, amongst other events and programming.\n\nMount Holyoke College was founded in 1837, on the ancestral and unceded homelands of the Nonotuck and Pocumtuc peoples. Their land is a part of the greater Kwinitekw (Connecticut River) Valley. We owe a debt to the enduring peoples of this land and actively collaborate with colleagues across Admission, the Division of Student Life, the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and our incredible student leaders to ensure that Indigenous students are supported on campus. College Horizons alums have consistently held us to this. On campus, Indigenous students have full access to the Zowie Banteah Cultural Center, which is named after a College Horizons and Mount Holyoke alumna. Our Indigenous Student Cultural Association (ISCA) was founded by another College Horizons alumna and Mount Holyoke alumna, class of 2021.\n\nAs a gender-inclusive women’s college, we are a private, residential, research liberal arts college with a tight-knit community of 2,200 undergraduates who are intellectually curious and socially conscious. Mount Holyoke’s academically rigorous curriculum is complemented by close faculty mentorship, rich experiential learning opportunities, strong career preparation and alumnae/x engagement.

It was founded in 1831 by Albert Gallatin, America’s fourth Secretary of the Treasury and a man known for radical ideas and innovation. At a time when higher education was reserved for elite men, NYU was one of the first universities to offer academic opportunities to everyone – to immigrants and later to women. Today, students enter NYU through one of three degree-granting campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi, or Shanghai and are also able to study abroad at sites in Argentina, Australia, Czech Republic, England, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United States, making this institution the premier Global Network University. In addition to the wide array of student resources, the Native American Club at NYU provides students with the opportunity to meet and engage with other Native American students, and the Native People’s Forum aims to engage the NYU community and others through events related to indigenous and Native American society.\n\nWebsite: www.nyu.edu\n\nAt Northeastern University, we believe in the transformative power of learning by doing and want to integrate your time in the classroom with hands-on experiences in the real world.

Supported, not pressured. And instantly at home, in a right-size environment surrounded by the natural beauty of these ancestral homelands and limitless fun. Northern students are deeply involved in real world scientific and creative research, professional conferences and educational community service from the start. Here you could help find a cure for cancer in our brain tumor research lab, design and market products at Invent@NMU, edit a highly respected literary journal or make an Emmy award-winning documentary. Our Student Equity and Engagement Center, Center for Native American Studies, Native American Student Association, and Center for Student Enrichment provide great opportunities for students to engage in their community, take on leadership roles, and be a force for change. How will you beNorthern?\n\nThe Northwestern campus sits on the traditional homelands of the people of the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa as well as the Menominee, Miami and Ho-Chunk nations. Founded in 1851 in Evanston, IL, Northwestern University is located on a lakeside campus just 3 miles north of Chicago, one of the world’s most dynamic cities. In 2014, the Native American Inclusion Initiative was founded with the mission to create spaces where Native American and Indigenous people are heard, their identities are honored, and they can be successful members of Northwestern as well as good tribal and community citizens. Most notably, the initiative has facilitated the creation of the Center for Native American and Indigenous Research (CNAIR), the Native American Leadership Council, a minor in Native American and Indigenous Studies, and the hiring of staff to promote the recruitment and retention of Indigenous students.\n\nWith a population of 8,000 undergraduates, Northwestern puts a strong emphasis on undergraduate teaching: our student to faculty ratio is 6:1, and nearly 80% of courses enroll under 20 students. We also put a strong emphasis on affordability and accessibility, meeting 100% of every student’s demonstrated financial need with loan-free renewable scholarships.

Although we mark the founding of Oberlin in 1833, this region’s history goes much further than that. The only way we can celebrate Oberlin’s values is to first acknowledge the Indigenous peoples whose stories and role in our land’s history have long been ignored. While this single gesture is not enough, we use this as a step towards bringing visibility and increasing engagement with all of the histories and communities that have led us to the Oberlin community we cherish today.\n\nOberlin is a liberal arts college of intense energy and creativity, built on a foundation of academic, artistic, and musical excellence. Oberlin is not only the first college in the US to admit students regardless of gender and race in 1837 we are also the only institution in the United States where a top-ranked liberal arts college and a world-renowned conservatory of music share a seamless student culture and campus. Oberlin also boasts an art museum that is known as one of the best in the country. Oberlin has been recognized as one of the ‘greenest’ institutions in the USA and continues to challenge itself to find better and more efficient ways to be environmentally responsible. Oberlin provides a world-class education to its 2900 students, the majority of whom continue on to prestigious fellowships, law schools, medical schools and PhD programs.\n\nOur students choose from a variety of housing styles: traditional residence halls, identity-based, language-based, theme houses and co-op houses in which students manage the house and share meal prep. Oberlin has over 40 identity-based student groups as well as over 150 events put on every year notably: Drag Ball, Indigenous Women’s Speaker Series, Black History Month Fashion Show and Obies for Undocumented Inclusion. Finally, the best way to decorate your room is to participate in Oberlin’s one-of-a-kind art rental program. Artwork by the masters – Monet, Picasso, and Warhol among them – are loaned to students for FREE! With its longstanding commitments to access, diversity, and inclusion, Oberlin is the ideal laboratory in which to study and design the world we want.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.oberlin.edu/admissions-and-aid/visit-and-connect\n\nFinancial Aid: https://www.oberlin.edu/financial-aid/basics\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mF74Mnw4Lw\n\nHow to Apply: https://www.oberlin.edu/admissions-and-aid/arts-and-sciences/first-year-applicants\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.oberlin.edu/admissions-and-aid/visit-and-connect/visit-programs/mvp\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.oberlin.edu/admissions-and-aid/visit-and-connect/in-person\n\nOregon State University in Corvallis, OR is located within the traditional homelands of the Mary’s River or Ampinefu Band of Kalapuya. Following the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 (Kalapuya etc. Treaty), Kalapuya people were forcibly removed to reservations in Western Oregon. Today, living descendants of these people are a part of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (https://www.grandronde.org) and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians (https://ctsi.nsn.us).\n\nOregon State University, Oregon’s largest public university, is home to more than 33,000 students and 200 different academic programs including engineering, forestry, health sciences, business, liberal arts, natural resources, and more. Students stay busy during the year by participating in research, student clubs, study abroad, and internships. During the school year, students can also be found playing on intramural and club teams or filling the stands to cheer on the Beavers as they compete in NCAA Division I athletic events. Go Beavs!\n\nAt OSU, there are multiple support resources available to students to help them be successful academically, socially, and mentally. Students can take advantage of programs such as TRiO, Educational Opportunities Program, LSAMP, Counseling and Psychological Services, tutoring services, and academic help centers while they earn their OSU degree.\n\nOregon State is also the proud home of seven Cultural Resource Centers, including the Native American Longhouse Eena Haws (NAL). Whether students are attending a Native American Student Association meeting, practicing for the annual luau with Hui O Hawai’i, attending the Salmon Bake or making fry bread with friends, the NAL provides space, support, and community for our students. The NAL also connects with the munk-skukum Indigenous Living Learning Community to create a supportive space centering the experience and history of Indigenous students at OSU while they are living on-campus.\n\nAdmissions: https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://financialaid.oregonstate.edu/\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/virtual-events\n\nHow to Apply: https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/apply-choose-application\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://dce.oregonstate.edu/inahaws\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://covid.oregonstate.edu/\n\nPepperdine is a small, Christian liberal arts university located in Malibu, CA, just 30 miles from Los Angeles. Pepperdine is located on Chumash land, and the university owes an immense debt to the Chumash people who have taken care of this land. Pepperdine is home to eight academic divisions and 45 majors. Inside and outside of the classroom, Pepperdine’s mission is to develop students to live lives of service, purpose, and leadership. We are a Christian community rooted in our faith heritage of the Church of Christ while welcoming students of any religious background to engage in these crucial conversations around faith on our campus. In alignment with our Christian heritage, the Pepperdine community supports justice and the treatment of every individual with respect and compassion. Pepperdine’s administration and faculty are deeply committed to all aspects of diversity and believe that diversity not only enriches our educational experience but that it is critical to it. One way this commitment is lived out is through our Intercultural Affairs Office (ICA), which strives to connect, engage, and inspire students through educational programs and experiences. Throughout the year, ICA facilitates off-campus trips to several destinations and several on-campus programs for students to attend, such as the Heritage month series. In light of 2020’s COVID-19 outbreak and the ongoing fight for justice in our country, Pepperdine has reflected and reevaluated the systemic issues within the nation and the framework of our university. The university president, Jim Gash, is committed to leading the charge to build a diverse, informed, loving, and unified community that becomes a light of cultural unity to the world. Current action items include hiring a Chief Diversity Office, establishing a Presidential Action Advisory Team, and focusing on collaboration and trust throughout the entire Pepperdine community.\n\nAdmissions: https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/admission/application/undergraduate/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/admission/financial-aid/undergraduate/\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/about/visit/campustours/video/\n\nHow to Apply: https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/admission/application/undergraduate/firstyear.htm\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/student-life/campus/intercultural-affairs/\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/admission/coronavirus.htm\n\nPomona College is a private liberal arts college in Claremont, Calif., about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. We offer a comprehensive curriculum, with 48 majors in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. One of the premier liberal arts colleges in the nation, Pomona is a close-knit and diverse community of accomplished scholars, scientists, entrepreneurs and artists who are passionate about making a difference in the world. There are approximately 1,477 students who come from 61 nations and 49 U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. With a student-faculty ratio of 8 to 1, our students work closely with their professors in the classroom, in the lab and in the field. And our location—within an hour of Los Angeles and the mountains, desert and beaches—provides countless opportunities for field study, research and internships. Almost all students live in one of 14 residence halls on our 140-acre campus. As the founding member of The Claremont Colleges, a unique consortium of seven colleges and graduate schools, we offer both the advantages of a small liberal arts college and the resources of a large university. Pomona College admits domestic applicants regardless of their ability to pay and then meets the full demonstrated need of all admitted students. Fifty-five percent of students receive financial aid.\n\nPomona College and the Claremont Colleges were settled upon the ancestral lands of Indigenous nations, including the Gabrieliño, Serrano and Tongva peoples. These tribes continue to call this land home, despite attempts of erasure from colonizers, both past and present. Today, we work to honor both their presence and legacy through Pomona’s Draper Center for Community Engagement, The Humanities Studio and the Benton Museum of Art, Scripps’ Native American & Indigenous Studies minor, Harvey Mudd’s coursework with Professor Alfred Flores, and Pitzer’s Native Initiatives. We will continue to support these partnerships and amplify Gabrieliño, Serrano and Tongva voices as we look towards the future.\n\nAdmissions: https://www.pomona.edu/admissions-aid\n\nFinancial Aid: https://www.pomona.edu/financial-aid\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://www.pomona.edu/admissions/connect/virtual-connections\n\nHow to Apply: https://www.pomona.edu/admissions/apply\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://www.pomona.edu/admissions/diversity\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://www.pomona.edu/covid-19\n\nPortland State University in Portland, Oregon stands on the historic homelands of several bands of Chinook-speaking people including many Multnomah, Clackamas, and Watlata/Cascade villages. There were also Kalapuya (Tualatin villages) nearby and the Molalla people in the Willamette Valley. Today their descendants are primarily members of the Grande Ronde and Siletz Confederated Tribes, with Chinook and other tribal relations at Warm Springs, Yakima, and the Chinook Nation. In addition to the federally recognized tribes located primarily in the state of Oregon listed in this document, we acknowledge the presence of numerous “unrecognized” tribes and indigenous groups, whose stories also demand our attention. Portland State University is more than Portland’s public research university. PSU is home to 23,000 students from all over the world. It’s a place to test ideas and projects that show the world how different is done. Our innovative approach combines education with creative problem-solving and collaboration across campus for maximum impact. With more than 200 degree programs to choose from, PSU is Oregon’s most diverse, innovative and affordable research university.\n\nPortland State also has many support resources to empower students to thrive. Students have access to academic support offices, student legal services, counseling, TRiO and multicultural retention services, and medical care all on campus.\n\nPSU provides spaces to many multicultural resource centers for students, including our Native American Student and Community Center (NASCC). The NASCC is a gathering space to celebrate and empower student success through culturally relevant programming, academic support, and inter-generational community engagement to preserve and perpetuate inter-tribal connection for Native American/Alaskan Native/Pacific Islander students and our allies through tradition, ceremony, and storytelling. In addition to our own original programming, the NASCC maintains a special relationship with the Cultural Resource Centers (CRC) Programming Coordinator to facilitate student-focused programming.\n\nThe land on which the University stands is part of the ancient homeland and traditional territory of the Lenape people. We pay respect to Lenape peoples, past, present, and future and their continuing presence in the homeland and Lenape diaspora.\n\nThe University was chartered in 1746 and is located in central New Jersey in a residential campus community with a thriving downtown. Service and civic engagement are central to the Princeton experience, as reflected in the University’s informal motto, “Princeton in the nation’s service and the service of humanity.” Various elements of the University’s mission — educating students, discovering new knowledge and developing students’ character — have a common end goal: to improve the community and world around us. To this end, the University aims to enroll the most capable students from all parts of the world and to provide them with an educational experience that strengthens their intellects, expands their horizons and prepares them for leadership — all while pursuing the highest possible standards of excellence.\n\nPrinceton’s unique academic structure ensures that a student’s education is grounded in the liberal arts with ample opportunities to conduct large-scale original research, the most notable of which is our senior thesis requirement. Princeton offers two bachelor’s degrees: a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.). Within these degree programs, students can choose among 37 majors and 54 minors. With 75% of our classes having fewer than 20 students and a 5:1 student-to-faculty ratio, students receive individual attention from faculty.\n\nPrinceton aims to support students from all backgrounds. Princeton was the first university in the country to institute a no-loan financial aid policy, meaning aid is awarded in the form of a grant, not a loan, allowing 83% of our recent students to graduate without debt.\n\nRice acknowledges that the land we sit upon has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst a number of Indigenous peoples, specifically the Apache, Caddo, Comanche, Kiowa and Wichita nations. Additionally, Texas is home to the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas, the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, the Lipan Apache Tribe, and the Texas Band of Yaqui Indians. Rice University honors and respects these Indigenous peoples and their descendants connected to this territory.\n\nRice is located on a 300-acre campus near downtown Houston, Texas, the most culturally and ethnically diverse city in the U.S., where over 145 languages are spoken. We offer over 50 majors and 27 minors among our seven undergraduate schools of study – Architecture, Business, Engineering, Music, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences. With 4,000 undergraduate students, Rice offers the opportunities associated with a top research university with the accessibility of a liberal arts college. Rice students make their home in one of the university’s eleven residential colleges, each with its own student government, traditions, and faculty support system. Currently, The Princeton Review ranks Rice No. 1 for “Best Quality of Life” and for “Lots of Race/Class Interaction”.\n\nOur signature financial aid program, The Rice Investment, grants families whose total income and assets fall between $0-$65,000 full tuition, fees, and room and board; $65,001 – $130,000 – full tuition; or half tuition for total income and assets between $130,001 and $200,000. We also meet 100% of demonstrated financial need for families that do not fall within the listed income ranges.\n\nExperiential learning opportunities are plentiful – Rice students and faculty engage extensively with NASA and have access to our own Rice University Campus Observatory featuring a computerized 16″ Meade telescope and other telescopes for use primarily in undergraduate courses. The largest medical complex in the world, the Texas Medical Center, is adjacent to our campus.\n\nAdmissions: https://admission.rice.edu/\n\nFinancial Aid: https://financialaid.rice.edu/\n\nVirtual Tour Info Session: https://admission.rice.edu/visit/virtual-events\n\nhttps://experience.rice.edu/\n\nHow to Apply: https://admission.rice.edu/apply/first-year-domestic-applicants\n\nNative/Diversity Programming: https://admission.rice.edu/life-rice/diversity\n\nCOVID-19 Updates: https://coronavirus.rice.edu/\n\nSmith College is located in Northampton, MA, on the homelands of the Nonotuck people.

Through the consortium, Smith offers deeper education and community for indigenous students, including the Five College Certificate in Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS). The NAIS annual symposium brings scholars from across the country to the Kwinitekw Valley. On Smith’s campus, Native students find community at Mwangi Cultural Center and Unity House, spaces built for students of color. We also have resources for those who identify as low-income; for example, the Common Goods Resource Center provides access to winter coats, toiletries, and opportunities for academic or emergency funding.\n\nApplying to Smith is free, and we are test-optional for the SAT/ACT. We meet 100% of demonstrated financial need, with no loans included in our aid packages. We award an additional startup grant of $1000 to our students with the highest financial need.

We stand on the homelands of the Wahpekute Band of the Dakota Nation. We honor with gratitude the people who have stewarded the land throughout the generations and their ongoing contributions to this region. We acknowledge the ongoing injustices that we have committed against the Dakota Nation, and we wish to interrupt this legacy, beginning with acts of healing and honest storytelling about this place.\n\nSt. Olaf College is a college of 3,000 students that provides 85+ different academic/professional disciplines. We are consistently one of the top schools to send students to study abroad, and we also allow students to receive scholarships for both academic merit and fine arts engagement.
