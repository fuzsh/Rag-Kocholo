Tullius Cicero, in 70 BC, attempted to persuade various audiences that C. Verres was guilty of extortion while governing the Roman province of Sicily from 73 – 71 BC. In addition, I claim that Greek rhetorical material provides a crucial context for the evaluation of a number of the arguments that Cicero chose and ultimately preserved in his massive oration In C. Verrem (Against Gaius Verres). These twin interests, namely the analysis of specific arguments and of their relations to ancient rhetorical theory, are at once recognizable as some of the standard approaches to the criticism of Cicero’s orations.1 What is new about my approach is that it starts from the thesis that specific Greek rhetorical material, the progymnasmata (“preliminary exercises”), was central to Cicero’s own training and, as such, is essential to understanding the conceptualization and presentation of his oratorical work. I offer the In Verrem as a test case of Cicero’s creative deployment of his training because, as the most massive production of Cicero’s entire, prolific career, it accounts for such a large portion of his extant oratorical corpus. But the In Verrem, in fact, is especially suitable for such an inquiry because Cicero most emphatically asserts that there are connections between his rhetorical exercise and his oratorical success, not only in general, but specifically in his prosecution of Verres. This study therefore follows, in a very real sense, lines of inquiry suggested by Cicero himself. The question of the relationships between practice and product is a timely one. The study of ancient literature is being transformed by a growing awareness of the roles that rhetorical exercise played both in the intellectual formation and in the professional life of ancient writers. Scholars of ancient education and rhetorical practice, however, have been focusing primarily on Greek literature or on compositions at the most elementary levels; the advances that they have made fairly demand that we now start to add the mature products of Latin literature to this evolving picture. Because the process of practice was a constant in writers’ lives, it informed their professional work, not only in the courtroom, but also in any other venue that they chose.2 1 I follow the framework of Classen (“Kunst”) and Craig (Form as Argument, 3 – 8) who also add empirical, as opposed to theoretical, analyses of Ciceronian tactics to our critical repertoire (cf., e. g., Stroh, Taxis). I quote the In Verrem from Peterson. I cite the Actio prima as Ver.; for the Actio secunda, I give the speech and section number (e. g., 2. 5. 112). Unless otherwise noted, all translations are my own. 2 A subtitle for this book could thus be “From the Classroom to the Courtroom,” with both “classroom” and “courtroom” used anachronistically. On the concept of school in antiquity, see\n\n14\n\nPreface\n\nNowhere is such continuity better seen than in Cicero’s In Verrem. The In Verrem is, to be sure, such an important and, at times, unique source for countless aspects of Roman and Greek political, economic, legal, and social history that many studies have focused on these areas. Yet it happens to be our first extant example of Cicero’s work from the years after his quaestorship in Sicily (75 BC), the very period in which he felt that his own oratorical abilities were finally perfected and matured (Brutus 318).3 The In Verrem thus also offers an almost unprecedented opportunity for the student of ancient rhetoric to investigate, in the work of the mature Cicero, the relation between his practice and his products. We will find, as it turns out, very many specific examples of Cicero closely developing and presenting themes and arguments, structural patterns, and, sometimes, even direct words found in the progymnasmata.4 The progymnasmata are manuals, written in Greek, that, though they are first attested in the first century AD, date at least from the second century BC. They teach the composition of discrete literary forms like encomia. The methods that are practiced can be thought of as building blocks: students mastered individual compositional cells and then incorporated them into fully wrought poems, orations or histories. The progymnasmata, I argue, were a central part of Cicero’s own intellectual equipment, a claim that has broad historical implications for intellectual history because it necessarily expands our view of the nature of Roman oratorical training and practice. Studies of Cicero’s speeches that examine their relations to rhetorical theory normally turn to the “Arts of Rhetoric,” treatises such as Aristotle’s Rhetoric or Cicero’s own de Inventione. I also consider many of Cicero’s rhetorical strategies against Verres in light of that tradition in order to set his progymnastic choices against other ideals and expectations. My approach of exploring Cicero’s use of the exercises for the In Verrem dovetails, rather neatly, with D. A. Russell’s perceptive and thought-provoking Cribiore, Writing, 6, 13; on legal activity in the Roman Forum, see David, Le patronat, 35 – 45; Bablitz, Actors and audience. The idea of “courtroom” is particularly inadequate for the study of a Roman oration because it was precisely the oratio that allowed the orator to transcend the temporal and spatial limitation of his one-time public pleading (actio). 3 Cum autem anno post ex Sicilia me recepissem, iam videbatur illud in me, quicquid esset, esse perfectum et habere maturitatem quondam suam (Brutus 318). We might stress Cicero’s claim in Brutus because arguments about the In Verrem still appear that implicitly associate it with his work “at the beginning of his career” (Tempest, “Structure,” 3, cf. 2). 4 This study, accordingly, tracks the path of a recent “classic” of Ciceronian scholarship: “Cicero must have seen even more clearly the parallel between himself and Demosthenes (sc. after the Second Philippic). It is only natural, therefore, to assume that Cicero turned to Demosthenes for inspiration in composing the Third Philippic… As has been pointed out, there are very few passages in Cicero’s Philippics in which he seems to be copying Demosthenes closely. What I am going to discuss is how Cicero may have let himself be inspired, in a more general way, by Demosthenic techniques of developing and presenting themes and arguments” (Wooten, Cicero’s Philippics, 59 – 60, with n. 3).\n\nPreface\n\n15\n\nclaim: “If we ask ourselves what is most likely to have influenced the future writer, the answer that suggests itself is ‘the exercises rather than the theory.’”5 I build upon Russell’s insight, however, from the other side: instead of a passive model of the exercises “influencing” Cicero, I frame the question actively and ask why Cicero so comfortably turned toward the exercises for his mature, creative work in the first place – were they not things to be left behind once he stepped out into the Forum? In fact, Cicero claims that he views rhetorical practice as a life-long process, an approach that represents precisely the ideal commended by the progymnasmata. As well known as the progymnasmata are, the connections between Cicero’s In Verrem and this Greek material have only rarely been commented upon – a rather surprising fact given that “Cicero and Greek Rhetoric” is one of the most well-tilled fields in the entire discipline of Classics. The lack of attention can perhaps be related to the most basic of misunderstandings: the first extant example of the progymnasmata, that of Theon, probably dates from the second half of the first century AD, so some critics may have assumed that the content transmitted in these manuals was later than Cicero as well. Yet not only is much of the material found in the progymnasmata manifestly older than the first century (some of it even looks back to the fourth century BC), but, given the astoundingly tralatitious nature of ancient education – an institution that is a paradigmatic example of la longue dure – it is entirely reasonable to assume that the material that Cicero would have studied, and internalized, was decades old and would continue to be studied in more or less the same form for decades to come.6 The thesis of this book, as a result, closely coheres with the findings of recent work on ancient education and rhetorical exercise. For example, it was only in 1997 that the first fully critical text of Theon appeared, an edition that allowed, in its turn, the editors of Quintilian, Book Two, to establish, at long last, that Quintilian himself drew both on Theon and on another source for his own presentation of the progymnasmata in the Institutio Oratoria.7 Above all, this study of the In Verrem complements the magisterial accounts of Raffaella Cribiore.8 She vividly depicts the intense struggle of ancient students for oratorical and poetic mastery, and she stresses that the chasm separating the literate from the illiterate was itself matched by a yawning gulf between the levels of achievement attained by the many workaday students and a Cicero. It 5 Russell, “Rhetoric and Criticism,” 140; cf. Russell and Wilson, Menander Rhetor, xix. 6 To take just one example, Quintilian believed “Greek rhetorical education…arising from sophistic and philosophical exercises, [survived] as progymnasmata” (R-W ad 2.1.9 quam et primam habuit et diu solam). 7 Patillon and Bolognesi, Aelius Thon; Reinhardt and Winterbottom’s edition of Quintilian, Book Two, appeared in 2006. I have, most unfortunately, been unable to take into account Patillon’s 2008 edition of the progymnasmata of Aphthonius and pseudo-Hermogenes (Corpus rhetoricum: Prambule la rhetoric. Paris, 2008). 8 Cribiore, Writing; ead., Gymnastics.\n\n16\n\nPreface\n\nis, accordingly, quite significant for my argument that the In Verrem is the work of the mature, not the youthful, Cicero, for this fact itself is a crucial point of contact with the progymnastic tradition: while Theon saw writers in every genre using the progymnasmata throughout their careers, he insisted that some of the exercises were only for mature writers, not tyros. One of my goals in this study is to draw attention to some important, but often overlooked, aspects of Cicero’s rhetorical strategies of the In Verrem. My methodology can certainly be applied to other Ciceronian orations: students of Cicero’s de Pronvinciis Consularibus will be able to put Cicero’s claims that L. Piso was a temple robber (Prov. 6 – 7) into the rich rhetorical tradition discussed in Chapter Two. But I am not here offering an exhaustive account of Ciceronian persuasion or even of the In Verrem. Scholars have so thoroughly investigated certain topics connected to the In Verrem – the composition of the juries for the standing courts at Rome, for one – and some parts of the corpus, the Divinatio in Q. Caecilium and In Verrem Actio prima, above all, that I do not need to rehearse discussion of these: it is enough to mention names such as Sternkopf, Stroh, May, and Craig, to say nothing of Habermehl, Alexander, Mitchell, and Brunt, to give some idea of the embarrassment of riches facing every student of this oration.9 By the same token, important aspects of the rhetoric of the In Verrem have been exhaustively covered, for instance, Cicero’s distinctive use of the so-called “commonplaces drawn externally” (loci extrinsecus assumpti).10 All work on the In Verrem, though, was put on an entirely new footing with the appearance, in 2004, of Gianluigi Baldo’s indispensible commentary on In Verrem 2.4; we thus wait, more than expectantly, for the most notorious, and grievous, desideratum in all scholarship\n\n9 Standard works on Verres, the trial, and the myriad legal and political questions related to it are, e. g., Habermehl, “Verres;” Alexander, “Hortensius’ Speech;” Mitchell, Ascending Years, esp. 107 – 149; and Brunt, Fall, esp. 144 – 239, 515 – 518; there is still much of value in Cowles’ Gaius Verres. On the oration, see, e. g., Sternkopf, “Gedankengang;” Stroh, Taxis, 174 – 187 (with earlier bibliography); May, Trials of Character ; Craig, “Dilemma;” and idem, Form as Argument, 47 – 66. Revisionist arguments about possible good aspects of Verres and his administration in Sicily have also been essayed; e. g., Martorana, “Venus;” etc. 10 These loci offer ways to present and evaluate the testimony of witnesses; Rohde, de Inventione, 41 – 48, lays the groundwork. For the In Verrem, the fundamental works are Schmitz, “Zeugen im Verres-Prozeß” (to be read closely with idem, Zeugen des Prozeßgegners) and Alexander, Case for the Prosecution, 26 – 28, 255 – 263; there are also useful remarks in Vasaly, Representations, 205 – 212 (yet not connected to 113 – 114); and still more discussion in Riggsby, Crime and Community, 129 – 136. The most important locus de testibus in the In Verrem (its outline already briskly sketched at 2.2.13 – 15) is Cicero’s ferocious assault on Messana’s laudatio of Verres: Cicero attacks it at the opening of In Verrem 2.4 (2.4.15 – 26) by damningly nesting it within Verres’ thefts from Heius of Messana (2.4.3 – 28) and then again, at the very end of the oratio (2.4.150 – 151), by contrasting it to the actions of Syracuse against Verres (2.4.136 – 149); note the model discussions of Baldo ad 2.4.3 – 28, 8 – 14, 15 – 26, 136 – 149.\n\nPreface\n\n17\n\non the In Verrem to be filled by the announced commentary on In Verrem 2.3 from UMR 8585 CNRS – Centre G. Glotz.11 My study both explains how Cicero tries to persuade in the In Verrem and speculates on why he chose the forms and arguments that he did. My concern is ever with the social functions of rhetoric: I am interested in how Cicero’s depictions of Verres as a temple robber, a tyrant, or an effeminate male might have disturbed Roman audiences; I speculate about what Cicero might have gained in the eyes of that same audience from an insistence on his own continual rhetorical practice, especially in Greek. I have therefore made full use of the methods and findings so painstakingly refined and achieved by scholars of modern social history, gender studies, and literary theory. I would hope, in turn, that my own discussion of the rhetorical strategies of one Ciceronian oration will bear fruit in places that I myself could not have predicted. The dividends from this study may well attract both Ciceronian scholars and critics of other Roman oratory and literature to invest time in exploring how rhetorical practice enriched the areas of antiquity that they know best. Certainly, providing a better context for Cicero’s statements in the In Verrem can only be a boon to scholars working on the much-needed analyses of the many crucial political, economic, and legal questions for which this oration is such an essential source. Yet the arc of this study, that is, the dynamics of a particular Roman embrace of Greek culture, may be of interest to Roman social historians. Consider those “Hellenistic palatial complexes known as villas” (to borrow R. R. R. Smith’s incisive formulation): Cicero knows villa life in Italy and Sicily very well (e. g., 2.4.36, 48, 58, 126, etc.).12 Paul Zanker, for one, has famously shown that the villa is “far more than an architectural category…in fact it is a key phenomenon in the adoption of Hellenistic culture by upper-class Romans.”13 An obvious analogue is that equally well-known Greek creation adopted by Romans (and also well-known to Cicero), namely, he¯ rhe¯torike¯ techne¯, the “art of rhetoric.”14 How thoroughly the Romans did so and how necessary it was to status and self at Rome is a continually fascinating story but one that this discussion of the rhetoric of the In Verrem only makes more intriguing. That both Cicero and his implacable enemy, Verres, publicly paraded a self formed precisely by means of the 11 Baldo’s In C. Verrem…Liber Quartus is more praised than used in some recent work, unfortunately. The editors from the CNRS group (along with associates) have already produced a remarkable series of working papers (Dubouloz and Pittia, La Sicile; Prag, SICILIA NUTRIX). 12 Smith, “Review,” 271; for Cicero on the villa, see Neudecker, Skulpturenausstattung, 8 – 30. 13 Zanker, Pompeii, 136, cf. 138: “Hellenistic courts provided models for the furnishings of Roman villas as well. It is hardly accidental that Cicero accused Verres of trying to match the aspirant to the throne of Syria (sc. Antiochus) in this respect (2.4.61 ff);” note Heius’ Attalica (2.4.27) that Verres coveted (and stole) and, even more explicitly, Cicero’s comparison at 2.5.27. Robert, “Ambigute,” 17 – 20, offers fine remarks on Verres’ “royal” deportment. 14 Compare Smith’s argument that late Republican Roman art is “best understood as an informed appropriation and reformulation of component parts of the Hellenistic repertoire” (Smith, “Use of images,” 89).\n\n18\n\nPreface\n\nproducts of Greek culture – material in Verres’ case (paintings, signa) and intellectual in Cicero’s (rhetoric, educational achievements) – is one of the most important facts about late Republican Roman society. That Cicero then monumentalized his embrace of Greek rhetoric in the In Verrem Oratio reminds us, if we ever happened to forget it, that his orations, indeed his entire output, are, along with the villa, nothing less than some of the most precious material remains from antiquity. Any digging in them, as here, will only reveal more about the lives and thoughts of those long gone yet still with us today.\n\nSections of the In Verrem Verres fled Rome before the second actio, or stage, of the trial even started. The oration that Cicero put into circulation (In C. Verrem), as a result, contains both delivered (Actio prima) and undelivered material (Actio secunda).15 Cicero chose, as well, to circulate his successful pre-trial attack against Q. Caecilius Niger, a presumed political crony of the accused, for the right to prosecute (In Q. Caecilium oratio, quae divinatio dicitur). The Actio secunda covers wide ground. The opening salvo takes aim at Verres’ corruption during his earlier life, particularly his tenure as urban praetor at Rome in 74 BC (In Verrem 2.1). Cicero then turns to his main target, Verres’ extortions while governor in Sicily. Here, Cicero examines Verres’ manipulations of legal proceedings, of appointments for local magistracies, of the bestowal of civic honors, and of various business deals (In Verrem 2.2). He offers a detailed expos of Verres’ gross exploitation of the tax collections in Sicily (In Verrem 2.3) and of his manifold thefts from Sicilian individuals and communities (In Verrem 2.4). Cicero concludes with a blistering attack on Verres’ competency as military commander, culminating in a justly celebrated attack on his illegal executions of Roman citizens (In Verrem 2.5).16\n\n15 For the most convincing argument for the connection between the circulated Actio secunda and the historical trial of Verres, see Alexander, Case for the Prosecution, 26 – 28, 51. 16 It seems reasonable to assume that Cicero put both the Divinatio and the Accusatio into circulation together as soon as possible after the trial stopped, no easy feat given that the whole numbers nearly 460 pages in the Oxford text; see, e. g., Frazel, “Composition.” Alexander vividly sketches the enormous labor that Cicero had to expend just to get the material together for the trial (Case for the Prosecution, 45 – 51).\n\nOrganization of this book\n\n19\n\nOrganization of this book The chapters of this book are all concerned, in their various ways, with the relationship between Cicero’s abstract rhetorical practice and his conceptualization and presentation of those attacks in the real-life prosecution of Verres. The first chapter lays out the historical and theoretical arguments for reading Cicero and the progymnasmata together. Here, I explore the unambiguous testimony of Theon, Quintilian, and Suetonius that the progymnasmata were, for them, “ancient.” I also take Cicero at his word that his own daily Greek rhetorical practice directly contributed to his remarkable success in the trial of Verres. A modern parallel might partly explain Cicero’s claim: we are comfortable with the fact that a professional golfer walks to the driving range every morning and spends hours there, before even setting foot on the championship course. Certainly, Cicero meant that his oratorical work in public was the result of hours of work in private. Yet, what is so remarkable is that Cicero also explicitly declared that his private rhetorical exercise directly contributed to his physical and psychological well-being. I therefore develop a notion of rhetorical exercise as practice akin to the way it is used, for example, in yoga (“the practice”): a daily, life-long, embodied process of exercise that, while it is beneficial in several areas, is also done in and of itself, not for a specific goal. I then show this distinct sense of practice both in Cicero’s life and in the progymnasmata.17 Such an inquiry into the relation between Cicero’s public work and his private exercise is continued more specifically in the next chapters. My approach, in general, is to proceed from the most obvious examples of Cicero turning to the progymnasmata to the least obvious. As I believe that the Actio secunda has a formal structure, a tell-tale sign of Cicero’s use of the progymnasmata is the sequence of his arguments: the progymnasmata suggest a specific order of arguments to make when attacking a temple robber or a tyrant, and we find that order in the In Verrem.18 For example, in Chapter Two, we will see that Cicero faced two distinct structural approaches to attack a man for stealing sacred objects: one, detailed in the Hellenistic “Arts of Rhetoric” (including Cicero’s own de Inventione), turned on defining goods or locations as sacred or profane; the other, seen in the progymnasmata, simply assumed the sacrilege and depicted its heinous effects. I show that Cicero chose the specific themes and the distinctive sequence of arguments from the progymnastic trope of common-place (koinos topos) to present not only Verres’ 17 My use of “practice” thus differs from Webb, “Practice” (an important paper). Webb is primarily interested in the role that the exercises play in interpellation (in Althusser’s sense): the progymnasmata were “crucial in laying the foundations for elite discourse, and must have helped to inculcate certain modes of thinking” (290). 18 The claim that an opponent was a tyrant was not the creation of the progymnasmata; the exercises offered specific ways to present such an idea most effectively.\n\n20\n\nPreface\n\npublic thefts as temple robberies, but also his takings from private individuals.19 I make a far more fundamental point in the second chapter, though. Just because Cicero presents the alleged stolen objects in In Verrem 2.4 as sacred does not mean that they were so: there is no objective status to objects or to images, but only our verbal resolutions of them (Verres will have had his own). Grasping Cicero’s use of the progymnasmata therefore opens up much broader theoretical questions about the relations of the visual to the verbal and, indeed, about the ways in which we present the status of objects in general. Accordingly, I explain the crucial rhetorical reasons why Cicero did not isolate an autonomous class of objects within Verres’ stolen hoard that is coextensive with our modern category of Art. Here, perhaps, the gap between my account and that of some modern readers may be the widest. Ver. 14 is as good an example as any of the manifold difficulties that confront us: Idem iste praetor monumenta antiquissima partim regum locupletissimorum, quae illi ornamento urbibus esse voluerunt…spoliavit nudavitque omnia. Neque hoc solum in statuis ornamentisque publicis fecit, sed etiam delubra omnia sanctissimis religionibus consecrata depeculatus est, deum denique nullum Siculis, qui ei paulo magis adfabre atque antiquo artificio factus videretur, reliquit.\n\nThe kings wanted the monumenta antiquissima to be “for an ornament to the cities” (ornamento urbibus); Verres, however, stole statuae ornamentaque publica and every deus “who seemed to him made more than a little skillfully (adfabre) and with ancient craftsmanship (antiquo artificio).” There is simply a lot that we do not know here: what were the criteria that comprised, say, artificium for Verres? What were they for Cicero? What criteria distinguished artificium from antiquum artificium for Verres? Did all of his contemporaries agree upon those criteria? Was the ancient standard(s) for artificium equivalent to our “artistic merit”? (Are we even all agreed upon that?) Greenwood’s English translation is representative of a very common solution to such problems (italics mine): “Famous and ancient works of art (monumenta), some of them the gifts of wealthy kings, who intended them to adorn (ornamento) the cities where they stood…this same governor stripped and despoiled every one of them. Nor was it only the civic statues and works of art (in statuis ornamentisque publicis) that he treated thus; he also pillaged the holiest and most venerated sanctuaries; in fact, he has not left the people of Sicily a single god whose workmanship he thought at all above the average of antiquity or artistic merit (paulo magis adfabre atque antiquo artificio fac-\n\n19 I follow Kennedy in adopting the hyphenated word “common-place” to refer specifically to the progymnastic exercise (Progymnasmata, xiv).\n\nOrganization of this book\n\n21\n\ntus)”20 From this perspective, a deus that lacked sufficient artificium to Verres would be of a different class (“no artistic merit,” “not a work of art”) from the (uniform?) monumenta and the ornamenta publica (the “works of art”), yet such a proposition utterly destroys the famous and clear distinction that Cicero carefully makes throughout the In Verrem between deus/signum/simulacrum (he uses these three terms equivalently) and statua. Cicero aims to control our reception of the objects that Verres had amassed and, as we shall see in connection with In Verrem 2.4, he chooses the progymnastic commonplace, Against a Temple Robber, so that we see them as stolen temple goods and not as anything else. If Cicero had isolated a separate class of “art objects” within the hoard, he would have undermined his very overarching rhetorical strategy. The progymnasmata are similarly illuminating in analyzing Cicero’s depiction of Verres as a tyrant, the focus of Chapter Three. There, we shall explore the ways in which Cicero combines the tyrant material with ideas that Verres was an effeminate man in order to weaken his claims of military prowess. It was especially gratifying to discuss progymnastic material here, as many studies of Roman adaptations of the so-called “Greek rhetorical tyrant” rarely include Greek rhetorical material, preferring, instead, to look only to Greek tragedy (via Roman tragedy) for models. Chapter Four offers a rhetorical reading of the most important and interesting part of the corpus and, without a doubt, one of Cicero’s greatest oratorical achievements, the speech in which he attacks Verres for extorting money from the Sicilian tax system. I show how Cicero again turns to the progymnasmata to shape this, seemingly, neutral factual material to meet his own rhetorical needs. Cicero claims that Verres allowed the tithe collectors (decumani) to exact more than a tenth and that he made the fields of Sicily to be deserted (agri deserti). Cicero audaciously aligns both charges as closely as possible in order to suggest that they are directly related, even though, logically, they are not. He presents the charge of agri deserti by means of the progymnastic trope of ekphrasis, an exceptionally emotional and vivid mode of communication. Cicero stresses this charge because he wanted In Verrem 2.3 to prepare the way for the portraits of Verres as a temple robber and an avaricious tyrant. In other words, Cicero aligns his arguments throughout the In Verrem, I argue, with an eye to his very own use of the progymnastic material. In the last chapter, I discuss the key element of the In Verrem: Cicero claims that this oratio actually contributes to the destruction of Verres’ public face 20 Greenwood, Verrine Orations, 1.81. Compare de La Ville de Mirmont, Discours, 92 (italics mine): “Tous ces monuments si antiques, dont les uns taient dus aux rois les plus opulents qui avaient voulu en faire un ornement des villes… Non content d’agir ainsi pour les statues et les objets prcieux qui faisaient l’ornement des edifices publics…enfin, il n’a laiss aux Siciliens aucun de leurs dieux, pour peu que la statue de ces dieux lui sembl t d’un travail assez habile et d’un art assez ancien,” etc.\n\n22\n\nPreface\n\n(existimatio). Cicero insists that the rhetoric of the In Verrem mirrors the reallife loss of political rights that Verres received from condemnation in the Roman extortion case. I show why Cicero needs to make this argument especially in In Verrem 2.2 and then how he develops it in In Verrem 2.3. My interest here is in modifying critical approaches that automatically dismiss Cicero’s arguments, whether in the In Verrem or elsewhere, as mere “tropes” or “stock” accusations. This discussion may thus be of wider application.\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata The ability to compose any oration, to say nothing of one as massive as the In Verrem, depended on years of intense work. This study broadly argues that Cicero turned, among other sources, to a corpus of Greek rhetorical exercises known as the progymnasmata for many of the rhetorical strategies of the In Verrem. Here, I take Cicero at his word that his Greek rhetorical practice directly contributed to his remarkable success in the trial of Verres, and I try to describe and explain the mechanics and motivations of such a claim. My approach follows numerous lines of inquiry suggested by Cicero himself: he clearly describes the In Verrem as a work of his maturity ; he constantly notes that he was devoted to life-long rhetorical exercise, especially with written compositions; he stresses the great benefits that he received from practice with the rhetorical trope of common-place; and he boasts that he only worked with Greek rhetors throughout his life. All of Cicero’s statements point to a close connection between his rhetorical practice and his products. I argue that a significant but often overlooked component of that practice was the progymnasmata, and I lay out the historical and theoretical arguments for reading Cicero and these works together. It is clear, for example, from Quintilian and Suetonius that, in Cicero’s day, the progymnastic exercises were the province of the Greek rhetors, the masters with whom Cicero exclusively worked. Above all, we shall see that Cicero’s very approach to rhetorical practice as a life-long process represents the ideal commended by the progymnastic writers themselves: they also testify to the great benefits of the common-place for rhetors, of writing for rhetorical practice, and of the exercises for writers throughout their lives.\n\nTwo kinds of rhetorical textbooks For anyone in antiquity who was interested, there were countless opportunities to experience speeches: one could listen to a slave read out sections from an epic or history ; one could watch tragedies or criminal trials, the recitals of wandering rhetors or poets, a civil trial, or a comedy ; even individual reading was normally done aloud. There were nearly as many opportunities to study speeches, speech making, and, above all, the concept of persuasion itself. The main avenues here were circulated copies of delivered speeches and written work on rhetoric.\n\n24\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\nAs is well known, the richly developed body of ancient rhetorical theory was most commonly accessible through two main types of texts.1 One group can be labeled “technical,” or “artistic,” treatises, terms taken, respectively, from the Greek (he¯ rhe¯torike¯ techne¯) or the Latin (ars rhetorica) for the “art of rhetoric.” Examples of such general surveys would be, in Greek, the (anonymous) Rhetorica ad Alexandrum and Aristotle’s Rhetoric; in Latin, Cicero’s de Inventione and de Oratore, the (anonymous) Rhetorica ad Herennium, and Quintilian’s Institutio Oratoria. These artes organize themselves in a few different ways, yet they still form a recognizable kind. The other type of text is the progymnasmata and this type offers its own contribution to the body of rhetorical theory.2 Even though the progymnasmata, and the artes exist as discrete texts, it is clear, for example, from Quintilian’s exceptional integration of both types that they were complementary and were, in fact, used together.3 The question of the relation of Cicero’s orations to the technical treatises is enormously important and, as such, has developed a long and rich scholarly tradition; scholars, on the whole, have been less attracted by the equally important question of the relation of Cicero’s orations to the progymnasmata. The time, however, is ripe for just such a consideration: not only do we finally have both a fully critical text of Theon and a scholarly commentary on Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria, Book Two, that takes into account that new text of Theon, but the ground-breaking and nuanced work of D. A. Russell and N. G. Wilson and of Raffaella Cribiore has transformed the study of ancient exercise itself.4 Such stimulating developments fairly demand that we now also start to consider the orations of Cicero, our largest preserved corpus of 1 Russell and Wilson, xix: “…two distinct kinds of rhetorical textbooks: the general surveys, from Aristotle to Quintilian…and the practical books of preliminary exercises;” cf. Barwick, Bildungsideal, 8, etc. I use the term techne¯, say, simply as a convenient substitute for the “general surveys” even though there was more variety in ancient and Byzantine usage. Thus the Suda can say that Theon wrote a techne¯ peri progymnasmato¯n; see Reichel, Quaestiones, 20; cf., however, R-W, 101 n. 14. 2 The term progymnasmata is also used for collections of the finished products themselves; see Libanius (with Schouler, Tradition Hellnique, 53 – 138) and Geometres. For more examples of such collections from the Byzantine era, see Hunger, Hochsprachliche profane Literatur, 1.92 – 120. Aphthonius offers both instructions for composition and examples of the completed products; compositions attributed to Nicolaus also exist (Rh, 1.266 – 420). 3 For Quintilian’s remarkable achievement in integrating the two strands so seamlessly, see, e. g., Henderson, “Quintilian;” note well Quint, Inst. 2.4.1. 4 Patillon and Bolgnesi’s edition of Theon (along with a French translation) is the first ever to use the Armenian recension. Reinhardt and Winterbottom fully describe Quintilian’s thoroughgoing use of the Greek rhetorical material, in particular the progymnasmata. Russell and Wilson’s edition and commentary on Menander Rhetor raised the study of the interrelation between the technical treatises and the exercises to an entirely new level. Cribiore’s Writing and Gymnastics revolutionized approaches to the exercises themselves because of the integration of so much papyrological evidence. The progymnasmata may even become more widely read in the Anglophone world with the appearance of a one-volume English translation of the extant works and related material by Kennedy (Progymnasmata).\n\nThe progymnasmata\n\n25\n\nspeeches in Latin, in relation to the evolving picture of the role that exercise played in the intellectual life of ancient writers. As we shall see, both ancient rhetorical theorists and Cicero himself emphasize that exercise was a life-long process. Accordingly, practice transcended the writers’ transitions from the classroom, as it were, to whatever venue they eventually chose: writing poems or histories, speaking from the Rostra, even defending or prosecuting someone. It stands to reason that ancient writers turned to their exercise regime for one of the sources of their mature work. What, then, were these exercises?\n\nThe progymnasmata The progymnasmata are Greek manuals that give instructions in the composition of various literary and rhetorical tropes.5 The name is derived from the Greek terms gymnasma, “exercise,” and progymnasma, “preliminary exercise.” The progymnasmata that are extant span some four hundred years. Theon, the author of our earliest example, seems to have flourished in the first century AD, around the time of Quintilian.6 Other progymnasmata are later : a treatise, dating from the latter half of the second century, wrongly attributed to Hermogenes of Tarsus (pseudo-Hermogenes); a work by Aphthonius of Antioch from the late fourth, or early fifth, century ; and one of Nicolaus of Myra of the mid- to late-fifth century.7 Several other authors also are known to have written progymnasmata, but their work is now lost; as Russell and Wilson caution, “we must remember that we possess only a small fraction of what must have been a vast pedagogic literature.”8 The progymnastic exercises include the following twelve (adopting the notation of Tobias Reinhardt and Michael Winterbottom): mythos (fable, 1); die¯ge¯ma (narrative, 2); chreia (anecdote, 3); gno¯me¯ (maxim, 4); anaskeue¯/ kataskeue¯ (refutation/confirmation, 5); koinos topos (common-place, 6); enko¯mion/psogos (praise/blame, 7); synkrisis (comparison, 8); proso¯popoiia (speech in character, 9); ekphrasis (description, 10); thesis (general question, 5 The progymnasmata are too well known to require yet another comprehensive introduction; standard accounts include: Kroll, “Rhetorik,” 1117 – 119; P-B, vii-cxiv ; and Cribiore, Gymnastics. Notable also are: Jullien, Professeurs, 282 – 331; Marrou, History, 172 – 75, 198 – 202; Clark, Rhetoric, 177 – 208; Lausberg, Handbuch, 528 – 49 (§§1092 – 150); Kennedy, Rhetoric in the Roman World, 614 – 41; Russell and Wilson, xxv-xxix; Kennedy, Rhetoric under Christian Emperors, 54 – 73; Hock and O’Neil, Chreia, Vol. I, 3 – 60; Heath, Hermogenes, 13 – 17; Webb, “Practice;” Kennedy, Progymnasmata, ix-xvi; etc. 6 On Theon, see P-B, esp. vii-xvi; Stegemann, “Theon;” etc. 7 See Radermacher, “Hermogenes;” Brzoska, “Aphthonius;” and Stegemann, “Nikolaos.” I tentatively agree with those who deny Hermogenean authorship (Radermacher, 877; Rabe, ed., ivvi; Kustas, Studies, 20); Mack and O’Neil, however, accept the attribution to Hermogenes (in Hock and O’Neil, Chreia, Vol. I, 158 – 160). 8 Russell and Wilson, xxvi; cf. Kennedy, Progymnasmata, xii.\n\n26\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\n11); and eisphora nomou (statement of a law, 12).9 Theon also continued his work with a treatment of five additional exercises, collectively called by Reinhardt and Winterbottom Techniques: Reading, Listening, Paraphrase, Elaboration, and Contradiction (Theon, pp. 102 – 112).10 Unfortunately, Theon’s Greek text breaks off in the middle of the discussion of eisphora nomou so, for the completion of that chapter, and for our entire knowledge of the five Techniques, we must rely solely on the Armenian recension.11\n\nThe progymnasmata are older than Theon and Quintilian At first sight, then, the use of the progymnasmata for the analysis of a Ciceronian oratio might be surprising because these exercises appear only in the first century AD. Yet Theon not only knows the works of earlier rhetorical theorists such as Aristotle, Theophrastus (e. g., 69.1 – 3, p. 13), and the “Aristotelians” (e. g., hoi peri ton Aristotele¯n, 61.23, p. 3), he also notes that he has predecessors specifically in the progymnastic field: “…now I will try to transmit what is necessary to know and suitably practice (engymnazesthai) before hypotheseis, not because some others have not written about these things, but because I myself hope to be no small help to those who choose to speak” (59.13 – 17, p. 1).12 How far back the progymnastic tradition actually goes is unknown; the question of its age has, accordingly, been the focus of a good deal of scholarly interest. Much of the content of these exercises is manifestly ancient – praise and blame, say – but it has long been conjectured that the origins of their particular form are, in fact, in the Hellenistic age. Karl Barwick, for one, makes a compelling case that the progymnasmata were formed by the second century BC.13 So, too, Georg Reichel amply demon-\n\n9 See, in general, Reichel, Quaestiones; Bonner, Education, 250 – 76 (an excellent discussion); P-B, xxxi-xcvii. For the notation, see R-W, 76. The progymnasmata exhibit variations in terminology and emphasis: thus, topos in Theon, but koinos topos in Aphthonius; Theon treats encomium and psogos together, while Aphthonius splits them up; etc. See, e. g., Russell and Wilson, xxvi; Hoppichler, De Theone, 4 – 14. 10 On these, see P-B, xcviii-cxiv ; for the nomenclature “Techniques” see R-W, xxxi. Theon’s Technique of Reading is paralleled by Quintilian’s entire chapter at Inst. 2.5 (see R-W); R-W identify as well points of contact between Inst. 2.5.16 and Theon’s Contradiction (ad 2.5.16 orationem). 11 P-B, esp. cxxix-clv, explore the complex textual history of Theon; they offer a French translation of the Armenian. 12 Hypothesis is a “finite” question or declamatory theme revolving around specific individuals, laws, etc.; it is distinct from thesis, an “infinite” or indefinite question. Hypothesis was the “defining property of the rhetoricians,” thesis, of the philosophers (Brittain, Philo, 328). 13 Barwick, “Gliederung,” esp. 283; see also Russell and Wilson, xxvi; etc.\n\nThe progymnasmata are older than Theon and Quintilian\n\n27\n\nstrates that much of the content in our progymnasmata has very ancient backgrounds indeed.14 The testimony of Quintilian, in fact, is remarkably consistent with scholarly conjectures of a Hellenistic date for the progymnasmata. To Quintilian, the progymnastic exercises are, unambiguously, “ancient” and, just as clearly, associated with Greece (Inst. 2.1.9, trans. Russell): Have we forgotten that the ancients developed their eloquence by the exercises of Thesis and Commonplace, and others (An ignoramus antiquis hoc fuisse ad augendam eloquentiam genus exercitationis, ut thesis dicerent et communes locos et cetera)… It is surely plain now that it is a scandal that rhetorical teaching has abandoned its original, and for a long time its only, sphere (eam partem rhetorices institutio quam et primam habuit et diu solam). Reinhardt and Winterbottom well show that Quintilian here is referring specifically “to the Greek past.”15 Indeed, Quintilian ends his Book Two discussion of many of the progymnastic exercises with an explicit statement about their Greek antiquity : “Such, in general, were the ways in which the ancients exercised their powers of speaking (His fere ueteres facultatem dicendi exercuerunt)… Speaking on imaginary themes…is said to have begun with the Greeks around the time of Demetrius of Phalerum” (Inst. 2.4.41, trans. Russell).16 As Reinhardt and Winterbottom put it, Quintilian “envisages Greek rhetorical education as arising from sophistic and philosophical exercises, surviving as progymnasmata, on which (from the time of Demetrius of Phaleron) declamation ‘proper’ supervened.”17 Indeed, it is evident that Quintilian himself must have used an earlier Greek source for his own discussions of the individual progymnastic exercises. Quintilian treats the exercises essentially in the order given by most of the progymnasmata. Theon, however, makes clear (64.28 – 65.26, pp. 8 – 9) that he will treat the exercises according to his own order: 3 1 2 6 10 9 7 8 11 12 (he omits 4 and 5). The extant Greek manuscripts of Theon, though, do not present the exercises according to that schema; the Armenian ones do. At some later date, therefore, the order of the exercises in Theon’s Greek tradition was changed, possibly to make Theon’s text more like, say, Aphthonius, the progymnasmata most commonly used in education of the day.18 Reinhardt and 14 Reichel, Quaestiones; cf., e. g., R-W, 75. 15 R-W ad 2.1.9 thesis; cf., ibid., ad communes locos: “The reference is again to Greece.” 16 Note well R-W ad 2.1.9 et cetera: “we know from 2.4.41 that Quintilian thought that ‘in general’ (fere) the exercises discussed in ch. 4 were those used by the ueteres before (he seems to say) the introduction of declamation ‘proper’ in the later fourth century BC, and he is therefore consistent in implying in our passage (sc. 2.1.9) that the exercises were all very old;” cf., esp., 2.4.41 and R-W ad loc. 17 R-W ad 2.1.9 quam et primam habuit et diu solam; cf. ad 2.10.1 nouissime. 18 For the manuscript tradition of Theon, see P-B, cxvi-clvi; cf. R-W, 76. Theon wrote for teachers (e. g., 65.30 – 66.2, p. 9), while the other three wrote for students. On Theon’s educational focus, see the fine remarks of P-B, xix-xxiii; cf. Hoppichler, De Theone, 40 – 45.\n\n28\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\nWinterbottom draw the decisive conclusion about Quintilian: “But we can go further : we need also to take into account the evidence of Quintilian, who follows what is in essentials the ‘Greek’ order, and who indeed, once he has dealt with narrative, has no known Latin source. That order must therefore have been that of a Greek source earlier than Quintilian.”19 The germ of the progymnastic approach is, in fact, already evident in the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum of the fourth century BC; indeed, the term “progymnasmata” itself may even be attested at that time.20 This treatise argues that certain elements are common to forensic, epideictic, and deliberative speeches: proofs, anticipation of counter-arguments, appeals for sympathy, and the like. Because such elements are needed in every kind of speech, they may therefore be profitably isolated: “if we habituate and train ourselves (gymnaso¯men) to repeat them on the lines of our preparatory exercises (analambanein autas kata ta progymnasmata), they will supply us with plenty of matter both in writing and in speaking” (Rh. Al. 1436a25 – 27, trans. Rackham). Manfred Fuhrmann, in his edition, rejects the phrase, “to repeat them on the lines of our preparatory exercises,” as being “anachronistic.”21 Even if we accept this deletion, the passage still clearly commends practice with exemplary material and, then, connects that practice directly with writing and speaking. Because precisely such an approach forms the backbone of the progymnastic philosophy of practice, it becomes clear that many of the ideas that we first find attested in the first century were around well before then.\n\nThe progymnastic approach to amplification (auxe¯sis) The name “preliminary exercise” reveals the training-orientation of these works.22 Training – whether it is for athletics, music, or writing – often starts with the “basics” and cumulatively adds more advanced exercises, with each 19 R-W, 76; cf., e. g., ad 2.4.18 anaskeue¯ et kataskeue¯ : “Quintilian from now on diverges from known Latin sources.” So Greek is Quintilian’s treatise that his most recent editors can simply say, “We have not thought it necessary to rehearse every detail of the Greek parallels to Quintilian’s precepts. The most significant are with Theon” (R-W, 77). The alignment of Quintilian and Greek practice is seen even at the most basic levels of education (Cribiore, Writing, 141 – 43) as well as at the more advanced: for example, he occasionally employs the “divisions” used in the teaching of progymnasmata, not those used for declamations (Inst. 2.6); see R-W, 141. 20 I am indebted here to the approach of Russell and Wilson: “It is interesting to see that Menander does not fit precisely into any plan attested before his date, though the elements in his scheme (sc. for encomium) can almost all be traced back to the age of Aristotle or earlier” (xxviii-xxix). 21 Fuhrmann, Anaximenis, ad loc: “haec verba ab auctoris temporibus aliena sunt.” 22 For the variety of terms used for the exercises, see Hock (Chreia, Vol. I, 12): Theon calls his work both gymnasia and gymnasma (60.16 and 23, p. 2); the title of Aphthonius’ work is Progymnasmata, yet he, too, uses gymnasia (32.26). Quintilian does not use the term progymnasmata,\n\nThe progymnastic approach to amplification (auxe¯sis)\n\n29\n\nexercise seen as but one component in the complete regime. Thus Theon claims that he presents the exercises in a graded order of difficulty (64.29 – 65.26, pp. 8 – 9). The similarities between rhetorical and athletic training were, in fact, evident to ancient theorists: Quintilian, for example, devotes an entire chapter (Inst. 2.8) to exploring them.23 Especially common to many different types of training is a distinctive circular shape: progress proceeds, not linearly, but “in a circular motion, by revisiting previous material.”24 Because training, however, is ultimately an individual affair, it is more of an art than a science.25 There is always, therefore, room for differing approaches based on the needs of particular students or the interests of individual teachers. A good example of the distinctive progymnastic approach to practice can be seen in its treatment of that most basic of oratorical skills, namely, amplification. In the words of the character of Crassus in Cicero’s de Oratore, amplification is essential to every speaker : “But the highest excellence of eloquence is to amplify something by ornamenting…[amplification] is the unique excellence of the orator, the thing most his own” (summa autem laus eloquentiae est amplificare rem ornando…eaque una laus oratoris est [et] propria maxime, de Orat. 3.104 – 05).26 The progymnastic tradition chose to practice expansion through the exercise of common-place, a choice that grew out of the Aristotelian idea that all three types of speeches had use for expansion. Aristotle himself notes that expansion (auxe¯sis) is a general technique of persuasion, not a logical argument-form; accordingly, it is common to all speeches, even though it very often occurs in encomiastic speeches (Rhet. 1368a10 – 29; 1391b30 – 92a7; 1403a16 – 33). While he does allude to various means of achieving amplification – comparison with famous deeds or people from the past, say, or emphasis on the superiority of the praised over contemporaries – he is not terribly interested in hard and fast rules; above all, he stresses that the amplification will best come from consideration of the general end (telos) of the speech and of the particulars of the matter at hand (Rhet. 1393a9 – 19). For example, if a speaker is writing a deliberative speech,\n\n23 24\n\n25 26\n\nbut does offer “various phrases involving prim-: 2.2.1, 2.4.1 and 36, 2.5.1” some of which “might consciously represent the Greek word” (R-W, 36 n. 1). Gymnasia is also the name for a particular kind of dialectical exercise practiced in Aristotle’s Academy (Reinhardt, 20 – 24). R-W, 153, conjecture that Quintilian may well have had a Greek source for Inst. 2.8. For example, Quintilian’s reuse, in Book 10 of the Institutio Oratoria, of material from Book Two is a “striking instance of a general rule stressed by Rafaella (sic) Cribiore: ‘paideia…proceeded in a circular motion, by revisiting previous material’” (R-W, xxxiv, referring to Cribiore, Gymnastics 129, 187). Compare R-W, 153 on Quintilian, Inst. 2.8: “The whole chapter shows that (ideally at least) attention was given to individual pupils.” There are good remarks on Cicero and expansion in Barwick, Bildungsideal, 48 – 51. For valuable treatments of the topic in the Greek orators and theorists, see Navarre, Rhtorique, 68 – 71, 301 – 311, and Plçbst, Auxe¯sis.\n\n30\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\nhe will expand on the end toward which deliberation aims, the advantageous (to sympheron), according to the needs of the case at hand. The Rhetorica ad Alexandrum gives more detail about amplification. It treats encomium and vituperation as an opposing pair (enko¯miastikon/ psektikon eidos): the former consists in the “amplification (auxe¯sis) of creditable purposes and actions and speeches and the attribution (synoikeio¯sis) of qualities that do not exist;” the latter, in the “minimization (tapeino¯sis) of creditable qualities and the amplification (auxe¯sis) of discreditable ones” (Rh. Al. 1425b36 – 40, trans. Rackham). The treatise offers a variety of ways to achieve the sought-after amplification or minimization: the speaker could show that the actions in question have produced many good or bad results; he could use a previous judgment as a standard for comparison; he could compare the actions with the least of those in the same class; he could mention the opposite so that the actions in question appear to be either great goods or great evils; or he could show that the agent acted intentionally and with premeditation and argue that we would do well or bad if we all did the same as he (Rh. Al. 1426a20 – 26b16).27 While recognizing a very close connection between amplification/minimization and enko¯mion/psogos, this treatise also does not restrict it to them (Rh. Al. 1426b18 – 21), but argues for the need to amplify the offense in a forensic speech (Rh. Al. 1427a2 – 5). Expansion was thus too powerful and ubiquitous a tool for the progymnasmata to omit; the question was where to put it in that scheme. Encomium itself was a progymnastic exercise, but, interestingly, expansion was most often not placed there. Our progymnastic writers thought that expansion would be best practiced through common-place. Pseudo-Hermogenes offers a standard treatment: “The so-called common-place consists in the expansion (auxe¯sis) of an admitted deed, as if the demonstrations preceded… You must speak in this way : first according to the investigation of the opposite, then the deed itself, then the comparison, then the gnome, then you will attack the past life inferring from the present, then you will get rid of pity by means of topics on the so-called headings of purpose and you will outline the deed” ([Herm.] 11.30 – 12.1, 6 – 11). Here we have not a series of suggested ways to achieve expansion, but a prescription of a specific order to follow in order to do so. Yet there are still important points of contact with both Aristotle and the tradition represented by the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum: the emphasis on comparison as a productive means of expansion; the use of opposite material in order to make the matter in question appear greater or lesser ; the drawing-in of the audience. Because all writers could use expansion with such great profit, the extant progymnasmata develop it in common-place, a form malleable enough to be useful for all three kinds of speech. As soon as theorists, however, pulled away from the Aristotelian tradition that forensic, deliberative, and encomiastic speeches all needed expansion and, instead, restricted expansion only to 27 On encomium and the Rh. Al. (1440b14 – 41b28), see Russell and Wilson (xxi-xxxi).\n\nDifferent approaches within the progymnastic tradition\n\n31\n\nencomiastic speeches, it was housed, logically, in the progymnasma of enko¯mion/psogos. Nicolaus, in fact, offers a rather hotly argued rebuttal to those who placed amplification there and not in the exercise of common-place (Nicolaus, 37.4 – 38.22).\n\nDifferent approaches within the progymnastic tradition The progymnastic exercises could be developed independently or in combination to build any number of new and different kinds of compositions.28 The modular nature of the progymnastic scheme, accordingly, allowed for a variety of emphases. Indeed, Theon notes that not only “have we devised some other exercises in addition to the ones that have already been handed down, but we have tried to give also a definition of each…and we have made clear the difference of each to the others and we have offered the starting points of each of the compositions and we have, in addition, pointed out how someone might use them most carefully” (59.18 – 20, 22 – 25, pp. 1 – 2). Such flexibility prompted a lively discussion in the progymnastic community of the kind already seen in connection with the question of expansion. Comparison (synkrisis), for example, always played an integral part in common-place and encomium/invective, but we have testimony that “some learned men” (ou to¯n phaulo¯n tines) also treated it as a separate drill ([Herm.] 18.20). The isolation of comparison may have taken place well before Theon, for he already treats synkrisis as a separate drill. Or, again, “some of the more exact ones” (to¯n akribestero¯n tines, [Herm.] 23.15) did not treat ekphrasis as a separate exercise because it already was practiced in fable, narrative, commonplace, and encomium, while “some learned men” (tines ou phauloi, [Herm.] 23.20) did isolate it. At times, it is clear that such modifications simply made explicit what had long since been customary : Theon decided to include encomium among the exercises “because we have become accustomed often to propound even for the young to write encomia” (61.24 – 26, p. 4). The progymnastic writers were also aware of the general surveys. Nicolaus, for one, is ever eager to show how the various exercises complement schemata found in the artes: the progymnasmata, he claims, practice judicial, deliberative, and panegyrical speeches, and they benefit the composition of each of the five “parts of the speech” (mere¯ logou): “proem, narration (die¯ge¯sis), antithesis, solution (lysis), and epilogue” (5.11 – 18). Nicolaus explains how the various progymnastic exercises, for example, fable (mythos, 9.12 – 15), narrative (die¯ge¯ma, 15.12 – 16.1), and so on, are crucial complements to the ideas 28 Note Henderson, “Quintilian,” 94: “Each progymnastic exercise is itself the basis of standard variations and elaborations, a second order of exercise which may be discussed with the progymnasma or, as with Theon, largely relegated to a second cycle.”\n\n32\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\nand approaches of the technical treatises. Such an interest in explicitly linking the progymnasmata to technical categories was, moreover, not confined to Nicolaus. As he argues for the usefulness of fable (mythos) only for deliberative speeches (9.6 – 11), Nicolaus concedes that “fable has already seemed to some people” to benefit all three types of speeches (8.16 – 17). In Nicolaus’ vision, and, apparently in others’ by the fifth century AD, the progymnastic exercises exist merely to aid work with the artes. What is so striking about Theon is that he views the exercises as more than simply a gateway to the technai, but as important in and of themselves.29 His views about the progymnasmata are all the more remarkable because, even though he “appears to be writing his book qua rhetor” (as opposed to grammarian), he himself “may have gone on to write a rhetorical techne.”30 For example, he notes that it is “obvious” (oude touto ade¯lon) that the progymnasmata are “entirely beneficial for those acquiring the rhetorical faculty” (te¯n rhe¯torike¯n dynamin, 60.1 – 3, p. 2), but he claims that the exercises also benefit a far broader range of writers. Thus, the rather lowly die¯ge¯ma and mythos help both the historian and the rhetor : “The one who has well and thoroughly recited narrative and fable will also well compose history and what is peculiarly called, in speeches, a narration (for history is nothing else than a composition of narrations)” (60.3 – 6, p. 2). There are moral benefits from chreia: it creates good character in those who practice it (60.16 – 19, p. 2). Theon claims that all writers can take something from the exercises: ekphrasis is essential for writers of history ; topos for orators (60.19 – 22, p. 2); proso¯popoiia aids the composition of histories, oratory, and dialogues and is most helpful (polyo¯phelestaton) in everyday life and our conversations, and most useful (chre¯simo¯taton) for prose (pros tas enteuxeis to¯n syngrammato¯n, 60.22 – 27, pp. 2 – 3); and so forth. When compared to Nicolaus, it is remarkable how infrequently Theon notes that an exercise is similar to one of the “parts of the speech” (proem and narrative: 60.10, p. 2; 107.21 – 24, p. 64). Theon’s relative lack of emphasis on the parts of the speech is an interesting point of contact with the Aristotelian, as opposed to the pre-Aristotelian, “school” rhetorical tradition, and is indicative of the double aspect of the progymnasmata as a whole. Aristotle chose the five “activities of the orator” (officia oratoris), namely, invention of arguments, disposition, style, memory, and delivery, as the organizing principle for his Rhetoric while earlier surveys used, instead, the parts of the speech.31 Aristotle pilloried the school rhetoric, the training (paideusis), “like that of Gorgias,” that sold pre-made courtroomarguments: it “supplied a need,” he sneered, “but did not impart an art 29 See P-B, xvi-xix. 30 R-W ad 2.1.1 Latinis…Graecis; cf. 101 n. 14: he does give the “impression…that he proposes himself to write a proper Ars rhetorica.” 31 For the various permutations of these two types, see Solmsen, “Aristotelian Tradition;” Wisse, Ethos.\n\nThe progymnasmata bear fruit elsewhere\n\n33\n\n(techne¯),” an activity he likened to trying to prevent foot pain by offering a selection of shoes instead of teaching the cobbler’s art (Soph. El. 183b36 – 184a8).32 Nevertheless, Greek orators often turned to this kind of material as the starting-point for various parts of their compositions – the “praise of laws” at Antiphon 5.14 and 6.2, for example, or stylized prooemia. The individual progymnastic exercises clearly practice just such ready-made arguments and are, in this important respect, close to the older, pre-Aristotelian rhetorical tradition. Yet, at the same time, the progymnasmata look the other way as well: they developed a set of skills to be internalized, utilized, and, most importantly, adapted to particular situations, and for this reason, they are essential for developing more abstract ways of organizing thought and communicating it. Composing, say, a comparison “from the less” or “from the more” begins a process that will reappear in Aristotelian topical work (both dialectical and rhetorical) and culminate in the conceptualization of large-scale compositions. Someone practicing comparisons or refutations in the progymnastic system would find, upon turning to Aristotle’s abstract method for developing the various means of persuasion (rational arguments, presentation of character, stirring-up of the emotions), a more familiar approach than someone who simply memorized a potted prooemium or epilogue.\n\nThe progymnasmata bear fruit elsewhere As building blocks of larger compositions, the progymnasmata are often best recognized elsewhere – in a forensic speech, a history, and the like. An ideal place to look for their use, therefore, is not in the general rhetorical surveys, but in poems, histories, and speeches, that is, in the compositions wherein the exercises were designed to bear fruit.33 When considering the question of whether the progymnasmata were known in the Roman Republic, however, even keen students of the exercises such as Georg Reichel looked for their presence not in the histories, speeches, or philosophical dialogues of the period, but in the Rhetorica ad Herennium, Cicero’s De Inventione, and De Oratore.34 That he found only traces of the progymnasmata there should not surprise: when the progymnasmata are first attested, they are self-standing and are not an integral part of an ars rhetorica. Some scholars have even doubted that the progymnasmata would have been available in Cicero’s day.35 32 33 34 35\n\nOn the “Gorgianic” tradition through Isocrates and beyond, see Pflugmacher. Compare Reardon, Courants littraires, 75. Reichel, Quaestiones, 12 – 19; cf. Kroll, “Rhetorik,” 1118.37 – 61. Clarke, “Thesis,” 165: “Indeed, I am inclined to doubt whether the progymnasmata were ever at all firmly established in Republican Rome. They were designed as a system, and in the early days at Rome there was nothing in the nature of an educational system.”\n\n34\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\nSuch skepticism is, thankfully, outside of the mainstream.36 On the other hand, monographs on Cicero’s rhetorical studies are, all too often, silent about the progymnasmata.37 Many scholars in other fields, however, have made just such a connection between practice and product; they have, accordingly, been interested in the role that the progymnasmata play in a wide variety of works. For example, students of the Second Sophistic have been particularly attentive to the rich means of communication with readers that the progymnasmata offered authors.38 So, too, scholars of ancient, medieval, and Renaissance education in the West; of ancient and Byzantine rhetoric and education; of the gnomic sayings of Jesus; and of art history have been keenly aware of the important roles that the progymnasmata play in their areas of study.39 Such investigations can be taken earlier in time because the exercises certainly existed before Theon’s day. From that perspective, the question of possible connections between Cicero’s orations and the progymnasmata arises organically.\n\nCicero on his own studia in the In Verrem Yet Cicero points to the importance of practice; my study of some of the Greek rhetorical backgrounds of the In Verrem thus also follows lines of inquiry suggested by the orator himself. On several occasions, Cicero asserts that there are connections between his rhetorical exercise and his oratorical success, not only in general, but particularly in the trial of Verres. Moreover, these claims are rather different, I think, from those stereotyped mentions of his debts to the triad “natural talent/practice/study” (ingenium, exercitatio, ars) that he often offers (e. g., Arch. 1) because, in both In Verrem and Brutus, Cicero directly, and specifically, singles out Greek study and rhetorical exercise. Indeed, Cicero states just such a claim rather forcefully in the In Verrem itself. Before he could begin his attack on Verres, he first had to defeat a rival, Q. Caecilius Niger, for the right to prosecute the former praetor of Sicily. In this 36 “…ancient education was so conservative that we may assume the exercises go back at least to Hellenistic times,” (Kennedy, Persuasion, 270); “It seems likely…that the formation of the standard set of preliminary exercises…must, however, have been fairly complete by the first century B.C., and maybe earlier,” (Bonner, Education in Ancient Rome, 250); cf. Kroll, 1117.52 – 1118.21; etc. 37 E.g., Laurand, De Ciceronis studiis rhetoricis; Weidner, Ciceros Verhltnis. 38 Bompaire, Lucien crivain, 33 – 43; Reardon, Courants littraires, 75 – 76; Anderson, Second Sophistic, 47 – 53; Swain, Hellenism and Empire, 28 – 29; etc. 39 Education: Morgan, Literate Education, 191 – 92; Clark, “Rhetoric and Literature” and “Rise and Fall of Progymnasmata;” Grafton and Jardine, From Humanism to the Humanities, 129 – 35.

One thing that might have helped Caecilius, Cicero claims, would have been if he had received a different – and better – education, namely, if he had, from his boyhood, studied and worked as assiduously as Cicero at the “best courses of instruction and arts” (si optimis a pueritia disciplinis atque artibus studuisses et in his elaborasses) and if he had learned Greek literature at Athens, not Lilybaeum, and Latin literature at Rome, not in Sicily (si litteras Graecas Athenis non Lilybaei, Latinas Romae non in Sicilia didicisses, Div. Caec. 39).40 Cicero, however, does not simply rest on the laurels of his top-drawer education; he also just as proudly boasts that, even now, as an adult, he spends every minute he has free from legal advocacy in “these studies and labors” (in his studiis laboribusque consumam) so as to be more prepared for forensic work (Div. Caec. 41). With qualifications such as these, it is not surprising that Cicero, not Caecilius, was chosen as Verres’ accusator, thus gaining the opportunity to contend with Verres’ prominent advocate, Q. Hortensius Hortalus. Cicero brings up his own education and his continuing rhetorical exercise in the Divinatio because he had to show that he was the best man for the job. Less immediately understandable, though, is why Cicero criticizes Verres’ educational level. More precisely, Cicero mocks Verres for not knowing Greek. Verres’ boyhood training was, apparently, even worse than Caecilius’: at least Caecilius had some Greek. If Verres had any Greek, he would have never stolen from the templum of Apollo on Delos because he would have read about the sacredness of that place (Si in pueritia non iis artibus ac disciplinis institutus eras ut ea quae litteris mandata sunt disceres atque cognosceres, 2.1.47). Cicero found evidence that Verres stole a Sappho, a work of Silanion, because it stood on a base that was incised with a Greek epigram, thus identifying it. If Verres, “that erudite, Greekish fellow” (iste eruditus homo et Graeculus), knew one word of Greek, then surely he would never have left behind such damning evidence of his greed and his artistic affectation (2. 4. 127). Clearly, Cicero hopes to belittle Verres by exposing his false claims to culture: if the jurors thought that Verres did not know Greek, they would reckon that his “acquisitions” of Greek masterworks such as the Sappho were simply the “lucky hits” of an uninformed, but pretentious, boor. On another occasion, Cicero cites the public records of Syracuse as conclusive proof that Verres executed Roman citizens there, but Verres, “that barbaric and depraved creature” (iste homo barbarus ac dissolutus), was not only too lazy to pay attention to such documents, he was actually unable even to read them because they were written in Greek (2. 5. 148). So, Cicero translates the decree for him into Latin: “edikaio¯the¯san, it says, that is, as the Sicilians say, they were sentenced to capital 40 Brunt reasonably conjectures that Caecilius was the “son of some Roman negotiator in Sicily” (“Patronage and Politics,” 275 n. 27).\n\n36\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\npunishment and killed” (edikaio¯the¯san, inquit, hoc est, ut Siculi loquuntur, supplicio adfecti ac necti sunt, 2. 5. 148).41 The charge of executing Roman citizens or stealing a signum is shocking in and of itself: anyone who could do this is, quite simply, outside of civilization itself, a man utterly lacking in morals. Cicero did not, however, have to add that Verres lacked Greek; he did so because, evidently, he thought this claim would make Verres look even worse in the eyes of the jurors. In fact, Cicero continually parades his own detailed knowledge of Greek culture, writings, and, in particular, of the Greek language throughout the In Verrem as one more way to show the difference between himself and Verres.42 A few examples may suffice. In addition to his constant references to the litterae publicae throughout the oration, Cicero also mentions that many Greek writers discussed the beauty of the famous carved doors of the aedis Minervae in Syracuse (incredibile dictu est quam multi Graeci de harum valvarum pulchritudine scriptum reliquerint, 2. 4. 124). He states that the “old belief” about the sanctity of Sicily to Ceres and Libera is “established from the most ancient writings and monuments of the Greeks” (vetus est haec opinio, iudices, quae constat ex antiquissimis Graecorum litteris ac monumentis, 2. 4. 106).43 Directly on the heels of mocking Verres for not being able to read the Greek inscription on the Sappho (2. 4. 127), Cicero displays his own knowledge of Greek religious nomenclature, beliefs, customs, and practices (2. 4. 128; cf. 2.1.66, 2. 2. 129, 158, 2. 4. 115, 142, 2. 5. 187). So, too, he tacitly offers the Latin equivalents of local Sicilian magistracies (2.4.93) or Greek architectural terms (2. 4. 140).44 At times, he simply acknowledges that “we” know how Greek actors speak on stage (Vt in actoribus Graecis fieri videmus, Div. Caec. 48); at other times, he tells the jurors that the saying “you have often 41 Bell well notes: “It is, in fact, very probable that Cicero dealt constantly with Greek documents… Such would have been the litterae publicae that provided him with evidence for his charges against Verres” (“Perspective,” 189). 42 The small collection of passages that I offer here, therefore, may be of interest to critics who might be tempted to use, for example, 2.4.4 – 5 to argue that Cicero offers an “affected ignorance of high culture” in the In Verrem (Stewart, Statues, 226 and n.11; cf. 73) or who simply claim that “Although for the most part he (sc. Cicero) makes little reference to his use of Greek, occasionally he alludes to the need to know the common language” (Bell, “Perspective,” 189); etc. 43 Cicero, on the other hand, makes it clear when he is merely relating a tradition: “There are said to be (ferebantur) three exceptional signa of Jupiter Imperator of this one type in the world” (2. 4. 129). Some, however, take ferebantur at 2. 4. 129 to be equivalent to “from the literature” (aus der Literatur; Neudecker, Skulpturenausstattung, 18). 44 2.4.93: Itaque ab iis qui principes in ea civitate erant praeciptitur et negotium datur quaestoribus et aedilibus ut noctu vigilias agerent ad aedis sacras. These civic officials would have been called, in Greek, tamiai and astynomoi/agoranomoi, respectively ; see Baldo ad 2.4.93 quaestoribus et aedilibus. 2. 4. 140: Primum mihi litteras publicas, quas in aerario sanctiore conditas habebant, proferunt; “Cicerone romanizza la nomenclatura architettonica greca, definendo la parte posteriore del tempio (opisthodomos) come aerarium sanctius, propriamente la parte posteriore del tempio di Saturno a Roma, dove erano custoditi il tesoro e l’archivio di stato (tabularium)” (Baldo ad 2. 4. 140 litteras publicas).\n\nCicero on his own studia in the In Verrem\n\n37\n\nheard” about the (now stolen) citharista of Aspendus is proverbial among the Greeks (Atque etiam illum Aspendium citharistam, de quo saepe audistis id quod est Graecis hominibus in proverbio, quem omnia ‘intus canere’ dicebant, sustulit (sc. Verres), 2.1.53). Yet Cicero also explicitly attests to his own fluency in the language: he notes, for example, that he addressed the Syracusan senate in Greek (2. 4. 147).45 While acroama (2.4.49), archipirata (e. g., 2.5.67), gymnasiarchus (2.4.95), hydria (e. g., 2.2.47), myoparon (2.1.86, 87, 90, 3.186, 4.116; 5.73, 89, 97, 100), palaestrita (2.2.36, 38, 46, 54, 140, 2. 4. 139), palaestricus (2.2.54), peripetasmata (2.4.27; 28), prytanium (2. 4. 119), pseudothyrum (2.2.50), scyphus (e. g., 2.2.47), symphoniacus (Div. Caec. 55; 2.5.73), syngrapha (2.1.91; 4.30), and toreuma (2. 2. 128; 2.4.38) were evidently in common use at Rome, Cicero does occasionally explain some Greek words: he glosses a Sicilian magistracy with a Latin phrase (proagorum, hoc est summum magistratum, 2.4.50, 85, 92) and he even comments on the difficulty of translating that great Greek civic honorific, so¯te¯r, with a single Latin word (2. 2. 154).46 But, for no apparent reason other than his eagerness to display his knowledge, he also repeatedly volunteers Greek names for things: Sicilian civic institutions (“in the Syracusan Senate, which place they call by the name bouleute¯rion;” in curia Syracusis, quem locum illi bouleute¯rion nomine appellant, 2.2.50); cult titles (“a simulacrum of Jupiter Imperator, whom the Greeks name Urion,” simulacrum Iovis Imperatoris, quem Graeci Vrion nominant, 2. 4. 128); and even of tour-guides (quos illi mystagogos vocant, 2. 4. 132).47\n\n45 Cicero also chooses to note here that Verres’ successor, L. Caecilius Metellus, rebuked him for speaking Greek in order to offer one more example of Metellus’ continual stonewalling on behalf of Verres (cf. 2. 4. 141, 145). Thus Cicero at once replies, not to Metellus’ sneer about the use of Greek, but to the real issue, the attempt to prevent the Syracusans from rescinding their eulogy of Verres (2. 4. 147). Cicero eventually does wrest control of the rescinded decree from Metellus. By embedding Metellus’ remark in such a negative context, Cicero invites his reader to dismiss it. 46 For the usage of acroama see Baldo ad 2.4.49 tamquam festivum acroama. Archipirata, gymnasiarchus (rare in Latin), palaestrita, pseudothyrum (rare in Latin), symphoniacus, and syngrapha are first attested in the In Verrem (OLD; Baldo ad 2. 4. 139 palaestritis; ad 2.4.92 Demetrius gymnasiarchus). Note well Baldo ad 2.4.28 de peripetasmatis: “Il calembour probabilmente basato sull’etimologia del grecismo.” Proagorus occurs only in the In Verrem in Latin. Cicero struggles to translate: SOTERA inscriptum vidi Syracusis. hoc quantum est? ita magnum ut Latine uno verbo exprimi non possit. Is est nimirum SOTER qui salutem dedit (2. 2. 154). We may also note cybaea (2.4.17, 2.5.44, 50, 59): “il vocabolo, probabilmente un grecismo, ma di etimo incerto” (Baldo ad 2.4.17 de cybaea). To palaestra (e. g., 2. 5. 185) and gymnasium (e. g., 2. 5. 185) we may compare Catullus 63.60: abero foro, palaestra, stadio et gyminasiis? 47 Note well Baldo ad 2. 4. 132 mystagogos. Cicero mentions a Punic inscription at one point (2. 4. 103).\n\n38\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\nCicero on the In Verrem and rhetorical exercise Cicero had many reasons to emphasize his own qualifications and knowledge at the trial of Verres – his relative obscurity, the stature of Hortensius, etc. Yet in Brutus of 46 BC, he still makes much the same claims about his own studium and labor, disciplina and ars, in Greek and in Latin, as he did in the trial of Verres nearly thirty-five years earlier.48 This time, though, Cicero has to walk a finer line. He wants to claim, again, that his exceptional study, especially of Greek rhetorical exercise, contributed to his exceptional success in the trial of Verres, yet he cannot denigrate his one-time opponent, Hortensius, a nowdeceased consular (d. 49 BC), in the same way as he did Caecilius, a potential provincial accusator. Moreover, Cicero in Brutus calls Hortensius an amicus, not least because he sponsored Cicero for the augurship, the political office of which Cicero was most proud (Brut. 1).49 So Cicero’s strategy here is to account for Hortensius’ successes – and failures – by claiming that he held nearly identical views on studium and labor as Cicero himself did. The evidence for Cicero’s earliest studies, unfortunately, is almost completely lost because Brutus focuses only on the period beginning with his tirocinium fori.50 Suetonius, in De rhetoribus, does, however, preserve a significant piece of information about Cicero’s youngest days. In a letter to M. Titinius, Cicero relates how, when he was a puer, he received advice from “the most learned men” (doctissimi homines) to avoid the recently opened lectures of L. Plotius Gallus, a Latin rhetor, and, instead, to study exclusively with Greek teachers (Suet. Rhet. 2.1; trans. Kaster, DGR 26.1):51 I for my part recall that when I was a boy a certain Plotius first began to teach in Latin. Since his school was attracting a great crowd and he was training all the most eager and industrious students, I was very sorry that I was not allowed to attend; but I was being kept on a short rein, according to the\n\n48 Cicero, for example, claims that he only speaks about himself as an orator in this treatise because it allows him to be “the herald of my hard work (labor), not my talent (ingenium)” (Brutus 233; compare 25, 318). 49 In addition, Atticus, one of the speakers in the fictional Brutus, was, in real life, as close to Hortensius as he was to Cicero himself (Nepos, Att. 5.4; 16.1); Cicero thus also had to be sensitive to Atticus’ feelings. Cicero and Hortensius’ famously checkered relationship (the nadir of which, arguably, was the year 58) had stabilized to such an extent by 50 that Cicero could assure Atticus that he had “a very high regard” for Hortensius (mehercule multum diligo, Att. 6.3.9); he expresses similar sentiments that same year upon learning of Hortensius’ impeding death (Att. 6.6.2). 50 For what is known about Cicero’s earliest education, see the model discussion of Clarke, “Cicero at School.” 51 Kaster ad loc. conjectures that this letter might have been written after 56 BC. On Plotius and the rhetores Latini, see Rawson, Intellectual Life, 76 – 79; cf. Kaster, 291 – 95. “Crassus” mentions the rhetores Latini at de Orat. 3.93 – 4.\n\nCicero on the In Verrem and rhetorical exercise\n\n39\n\nadvice of some very learned authorities who thought native talents could be better nurtured by Greek training (Graecis exercitationibus). The exact nature of these earliest “Greek exercises” and the identity of the teachers with whom Cicero studied are unknown. Yet such reticence about particulars is balanced by Cicero’s remarkable readiness, at all periods in his life, to speak in more general terms about study and his incredible devotion to it. Cicero’s portrait of himself as an adulescens in Brutus, for example, is notable for two things: a glaringly incomplete, nonpolitical explanation of his absence from the turbulent 80s BC and an emphasis, instead, on his rhetorical exercise, especially in Greek.52 Cicero’s Greek was plainly excellent by his adolescence because, while he was still a puer, he was already acquainted with Phaedrus and Patro, the successive heads of the Epicurean school, during their visits at Rome from Athens (Fam. 13.1.2). Cicero assumed the toga virilis and began his tirocinium fori in 90 BC at age 16 (Brut. 303). During the Social War (91 – 88 BC), although the activity of the courts at Rome was almost entirely suspended, Cicero “constantly” (frequens) attended to the proceedings of the only cases that were tried, namely, those under the lex Varia (Brut. 304). Contiones, on the hand, offered many more opportunities for an inquisitive teenager to watch and listen; in fact, Cicero claims that he listened to these speeches “nearly every day” (Brut. 305). Such a flurry of activity must have made an enormous impression on Cicero; one can easily imagine him each evening replaying the arguments, gestures, and bons mots of the various orators and incorporating them into his own exercise regime. Over the next few years Cicero studied other disciplines as well – civil law with Scaevola in 89 BC, philosophy with no less than Philo in 88 BC (Brut. 306): “Constantly listening to the orators who were still around, I was held with the sharpest eagerness and, though writing and reading and practice-speaking every day (acerrimo studio tenebar cottidieque et scribens et legens et commentans), I was not content with oratorical exercises only” (oratoriis tantum exercitationibus, Brut. 305).53 Yet even with his broadened studies, Cicero kept up his study of rhetoric. It is well known how attracted Cicero was to the philosophical teachings of Philo, yet, through the careful researches of Charles Brittain and Tobias Reinhardt, it has become much clearer how equally indebted he was to the rhetorical theorizing and exercises of Philo.54 For example, Cicero embraced 52 For an excellent account of Cicero in the 80s BC and the slanted account of that period later in Brutus, see Mitchell, Ascending Years, 52 – 92. 53 Reid offers a full account of Cicero’s lifelong work in philosophy (Academica, 1 – 10). 54 There are excellent remarks on Philo and Cicero in Kennedy, Persuasion, 327 – 28. In De Oratore, Cicero depicts Philo as teaching rhetoric in the Academy at Athens already in 91 BC (de Orat. 3.110). Cicero notes that he heard Philo lecture on both philosophy and rhetoric: “Philo, whom we often listened to, made it his practice to teach precepts of rhetoricians and of philosophers alternately” (Tusc. 2.9).\n\n40\n\nChapter One: Cicero and the Progymnasmata\n\nand actively promoted the use of an exercise known as thesis that Philo had developed. This kind of thesis is to be distinguished from both the philosophical and the progymnastic forms of the same name. Reinhardt notes, “There had been a philosophical use of the term thesis for centuries, in the sense of ‘(discussion of a) philosophical problem’”.55 Yet Philo, apparently, modified thesis for rhetorical, not strictly philosophical, use so that the “questions are taken directly from ethical and political debate, but systematized into a formal and elaborate schema wholly alien to the philosophical practice of the thesis (i. e., to Academic philosophical practice). The result is the fulfillment of the promise of Hermagoras’ treatise: a technical, rhetorical treatment of the issues of ‘political discourse.’”56 Cicero gives many examples of theseis in the style of Philo. In 49 BC, he informs Atticus that he takes up, in private, meditations directly on the political issues of the day, “some theseis as it were” (quasdam tamquam theseis, Att. 9.4.1). Around the year 46 BC he even makes his practice with this exercise publicly known by means of his dedication of the Paradoxa Stoicorum. He tells Brutus “you will taste a type of exercise that I have been in the habit of using when I translate those things that are called in the schools ‘thetically’ to this oratorical type of speaking that is our own” (degustabis genus exercitationum earum quibus uti consuevi, cum ea quae dicuntur in scholis thetiko¯s ad nostrum hoc oratorium transfero dicendi genus, Parad. 5). As Brittain aptly puts it, the Paradoxa Stoicorum “is an extended display of explicitly rhetorical argument on ethical theseis.”57 The following years, 87 – 85 BC, find Cicero still working day and night “in the practice of every kind of learning” (in omnium doctrinarum meditatione, Brut. 308). He continues to study various subjects, particularly dialectic, with Diodotus the Stoic.58 Yet Cicero takes pains to point out that he at no time neglected his rhetorical exercise (Brut. 309 – 10): Even though I was devoted to this learned man (sc. Diodotus) and to his many and varied arts, nevertheless no day was free from oratorical exercises (ab exercitationibus oratoriis nullus dies vacuus esset). I prepared practice speeches for delivery – declaiming, as they now say (Commentabar declamitans – sic enim nunc loquuntur) – often with M. Piso and Q. Pompeius or someone every day (cottidie), and I did this much in Latin, but more often in Greek (idque faciebam multum etiam Latine, sed Graece saepius), partly be55 Reinhardt, 9. The progymnastic thesis covered abstract, indefinite questions such as “Should one marry? Do gods exist?” 56 Brittain, Philo, 341; cf., ibid., 304 – 05, 328 – 42; Reinhardt, 3 – 17, 336, 346 – 50, 354 – 57. Reinhart has made a compelling case that the “underlying source of the Topica represents material Cicero had retained from the rhetorical teachings” of Philo (336). 57 Brittain, Philo, 341. 58 Diodotus may very well have been an important source for Cicero’s rhetorical thinking also; Reinhardt, 306, suggests him as a “possible mediator” of the Stoic logical material handled at Top. 53 – 57. On Cicero’s earlier work with the Epicurean Phaedrus, see Reid, Academica, 1.\n\nCicero on the In Verrem and rhetorical exercise\n\n41\n\ncause a speech in Greek (Graeca oratio), supplying the need for more embellishments, introduces just this habit when speaking in Latin, partly because the most learned Greeks (a Graecis summis doctoribus) were not able to correct and teach me unless I spoke in Greek (nisi Graece dicerem). The amount of time that Cicero devoted to rhetorical practice did not decrease as he attained progressively higher levels of mastery – he was, after all, at this point able to practice in Greek with the summi doctores.59 Throughout the years of his Eastern sojourn (79 – 77 BC), Cicero, now in his late twenties, did not forget his rhetorical practice. Even during his time reading philosophy at Athens in 79 with his old acquaintance, Phaedrus (Fin. 1.16), and with Antiochus himself, Cicero was “accustomed to be trained with zeal” (studiose exerceri solebam) by Demetrius the Syrian, “an old and skilled teacher of rhetoric” (veterem et non ignobilem dicendi magistrum, Brut. 315). After his stay in Athens, Cicero traveled throughout Asia in the compan"
