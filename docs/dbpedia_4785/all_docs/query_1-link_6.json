        "text": "Community service in Lower Division focuses on encouraging children to adopt habits of giving. Through outreach projects, school activities, and small group conversations, students explore values such as generosity, respect, kindness, commitment, passion, and integrity, which naturally complement all community service efforts.\n\nHere are just a few examples of how Lower Division students give back.\n\nSecond Grade: Once a year, second grade students bring in ingredients and gather to make pumpkin bread (baked by SAGE Dining Services) to donate to the Berkeley Food Pantry.\n\nThird Grade: On Valentine’s Day, third grade students make treat baskets for families staying at the Ronald McDonald House on Davis Islands.\n\nFourth Grade: Fourth graders collaborate each year with Children’s Home Network, a nonprofit providing resources to at-risk children and families, as part of their fall service project. They bring in pumpkins, pillows, and various toiletries to donate.\n\nFifth grade: Fifth graders participate in a winter service project called The Berkeley Food Pantry Warmth and Wellness Drive. On the last day of school before Winter Break, they work together to assemble holiday bags full of hygiene items to donate, as well as some handmade holiday ornaments.\n\nIn Upper Division, students provide service within the community, both formally and informally. The purpose of community service in Upper Division is to foster responsibility, commitment, and community spirit, while helping students learn about themselves and the world around us.\n\nFor a student’s formal service requirement, he or she finds volunteer opportunities in the community. The expectation is that this will be an activity that is both interesting and rewarding, and that the student will realize the value of contributing to the community. The goal for each student is to perform meaningful community service, an act that demonstrates charity and a genuine caring for humanity.\n\nService in Berkeley’s Upper Division is guided by a Student Service Council, which is made up of representatives from tenth through twelfth grade. Each student is required to complete and submit documentation for community service hours. Students in ninth through eleventh grade must complete at least 22 hours of community service each year. Students in twelfth grade are required to complete at least 10 hours of community service each year.\n\nHere’s a glimpse at how some of our Upper Division students have given back:\n\nGrace Kliewer ’24 volunteers at the Berkeley Food Pantry every other Saturday morning, across the street from campus. It provides food, clothes, and other necessities to those in need in Town ‘n’ Country.\n\nDavid Fink ’24, Zachary Hashemian, and Harrison Rainey ’24 organized and hosted a charity pickleball tournament in support of their organization, Pickleball for a Purpose, which aims to destigmatize youth mental illness and work toward a solution to the recent spike in mental health issues in our community and nationwide.\n\nCaroline Kelly ’24 volunteers with the Heart 4 the Homeless tutoring program, which provides academic assistance to students in fifth through twelfth grade in Tampa who are experiencing homelessness.\n\nDavid De Coursy ’24 co-taught a Sparking Fun with Physics class with Anuv Singh ’24 on three Saturdays during his senior year at the Berkeley Academy, a free, signature service program on Berkeley’s campus that helps highly motivated students from low-income households in our Tampa Bay community reach their unique potential and achieve their dream of going to college.\n\nThe Upper Division service experience culminates during a student’s senior year on Senior Buddy Day. Twelfth graders host children from the Redlands Christian Migrants Association (RCMA) on campus, engaging in games and activities that are planned and led by the senior class. This project brings the senior class together, reinforces their commitment to making a positive difference in the world, and provides a memorable experience for RCMA’s kids."
