Here‚Äôs why they stand out: Early-Stage Access: Seed investments offer a chance to enter at the ground floor of innovative companies, investment offerings and opportunities, often before they hit the radar of larger institutional investors. High Growth Potential: While they can be riskier, synergistic offerings that balance your portfolio offer the lowest risk. These early-stage investments can yield significant returns as new offerings, funds or entities grow. The key is a well-researched, strategic selection process. Diversification: Adding seed investments to your portfolio can provide balance, spreading risk across different investment types and sectors. Impact: Your investment can play a crucial role in a new offerings development, driving innovation and possibly creating new market leaders. Considerations: Risk vs. Reward: Look For.. High potential returns with significant risk mitigation structures. It‚Äôs vital to assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Due Diligence: Thorough research and due diligence are paramount to identify opportunities with the best growth prospects. Professional Advice: Consult with financial advisors to align seed investments with your overall investment strategy. Seed investments in private funds are not just financial ventures; they're essential with emerging funds, offerings and companies at the forefront of innovation.

What if this fund didn't have a 2 and 20 model but instead had a 0 and 20 model? 12% hurdle per year üí∞ Check sizes: 10,000 - 600,000 per check (initially start with 10,000 and then tranche future investment as company grows) üê£ Pre-seed and Seed investment üëåüèº Expecting to sell either M&A stage or sell their convertible (at 6.5% interest) to VCs at Series A üëÄ Monitor companies for 24 months get to Positive EBIDTA and then sell (exit) (Don't chase growth, only chase milestones in order to grow realistically) üõç One of the ways to help founders manage slow burn rate and high profitability is to help them secure a big customer LPs: The investors can only match but cannot top the cofounder‚Äôs money (Min investment 250,000 per year across 10-11 deals a year) Example: Invest $100,000 in total In 24 months, exit at $300,000 There will be $200,000 in profit $24,000 given back to investors for 2 years 12% annual return There will be $176,000 left as profit 35,000 / 7 cofounders of the fund (act as 20% management fee given to the founders) Investors (including the founders) 276,000-35,000=241,000 So if there were 20 LPs (some of which include the founders), they each get $12,050 each on their return. The investors can only match but cannot top the cofounder‚Äôs money (Min investment 250,000 per year across 10-11 deals a year) Overall, the target is 2.5X - 3.5X return within 24 months for all investors. The focus is to help university student founders get to profitability and desirability for. I wonder: -Yes right now it is a downturn in the market so I can see why a strong focus on EBIDTA works and having a realistic growth path is favourable -Will this market focus on growth again when the market changes? How does that affect the Series A investors? -Does this need to adapt as they go into more markets in order to have more expertise on hand? -Is this kind of model more favourable for LPs in the future? -What is the overall portfolio performance? How does that compare?\n\nüåü Exciting News! LUIS Joins the NorthEdge Private Equity Challenge 2024 üåü I am thrilled to announce that Liverpool University Investment Society has officially joined the lineup for the North Edge Private Equity Challenge 2024! This prestigious event, now in its sixth year, offers university students a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into the world of private equity and experience the investment process firsthand. üë• This year, we're excited to enter 4 teams from LUIS where we will compete with students from esteemed societies including the Twikker Fund - Sheffield Student Investment Fund, University of Leeds Trading & Investment Society Investment Society, The University of Manchester Trading & Investment Society, and new participants Aston Finance and Trading Society and Lancaster University Investment and Finance Society. üèÉ‚ôÇÔ∏è Running through to late April, the programme features enriching sessions on value creation, corporate finance, and due diligence, led by industry experts from NorthEdge, Deloitte, Houlihan Lokey, and more! The programme features weekly insights into the core aspects of private equity, culminating in a series of case studies where teams will research a firm and present an investment opportunity pitch directly to NorthEdge's internal investment committee. üë®üíª As one of the few challenges of its kind in the UK, this initiative highlights NorthEdge's dedication to fostering a diverse talent pool in the private equity industry. Through this challenge, we aim to learn about the critical roles of market research, company valuations, management team analysis, due diligence and team collaboration in making a successful investment pitch. We are also discovering the emerging topics shaping the future of private equity. ü§ù We extend our heartfelt thanks to Greg Rawsthorne, a distinguished University of Liverpool alumnus, for making this opportunity possible for #LUIS! #PrivateEquityChallenge2024 #NorthEdge #futuretalent #Investment #privateequity"
