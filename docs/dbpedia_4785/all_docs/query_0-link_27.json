This volume arises from gratitude to this scholarly inheritance and aims to help open Victorine thought to new readers among scholars of religion, theology, philosophy, culture, literature, and history. The Victorines take their name from the Abbey of Saint-Victor, which was once located on the Left Bank of Paris. That Abbey was destroyed in the Revolution, remaining only in name as the Saint-Victor Quarter. The heyday of the Abbey of Saint-Victor began before the University of Paris, in the twelfth and early thirteenth century. In that time, the abbey and school produced a constellation of important writers whose brilliance, mutual fellowship, and wider influence was rivalled only in the great universities of Paris or Oxford in the European Middle Ages. The origins of Saint-Victor began in 1108, when the famous and respected William of Champeaux began to break from his powerful and lucrative positions as schoolmaster and archdeacon of the old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. First, he renounced his individual revenues as archdeacon; shortly after (in 1111), he removed to a ruined church (the vetus cella) outside Paris. In the community that followed him, William planted the seed that would become the canons regular of the Abbey of Saint-Victor.1\n\n1 It has traditionally been thought that William departed immediately to an old, ruined church outside Paris, a vetus cella. See Fourier Bonnard, Histoire de l’Abbaye royale et de l’Ordre des Chanoines Réguliers de St-Victor de Paris (Paris: Arthur Savaète, 1904), pp. 4–7. More recently, Constant Mews has argued for William’s gradual shift out of the canonry, only complete in 1111, on the basis of documentary evidence that seems to place William teaching and operating within the Notre Dame cloister.

Victorine Restoration: Essays on Hugh of St Victor, Richard of St Victor, and Thomas Gallus, ed. by Robert J. Porwoll and David Allison Orsbon, CURSOR 39 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2021), pp. 11–42 BREPOLS PUBLISHERS 10.1484/M.CURSOR-EB.5.122081\n\n12\n\nro be rt j p o rwo l l\n\nFrom this humble and uncertain beginning, the canons of Saint-Victor, or Victorines, experienced a meteoric ascension. In a few years, Saint-Victor had become a mother house overseeing a federation of affiliated houses and abbeys, an influential ally in the reformist movement, and an amply-supplied object of royal and noble endowments.2 Saint-Victor’s prominence waned in the thirteenth century. Yet, the Victorine thinkers that the abbey attracted and produced bore fruit in intellectual abundance. These include its first abbot Gilduin, Adam of Saint-Victor, Andrew of Saint-Victor, Achard of Saint-Victor, and Godfrey of Saint-Victor, but most especially Hugh of Saint-Victor, Richard of Saint-Victor, and Thomas Gallus. The Victorines were both prolific and profound in their thought and writings. In their works covering pedagogical, philosophical, exegetical, spiritual, liturgical, and mystical topics, these giants of Saint-Victor constitute a repository of medieval thought and cast a long shadow in their readership and influence. They appear to have gained universal respect from their twelfth-century contemporaries, including Bernard of Clairvaux, Peter Lombard, and John of Salisbury. Moreover, scholastic, monastic, and vernacular theological cultures all held the Victorines in high regard. Thomas Aquinas treated their opinions seriously, and other Dominicans incorporated Victorine elements into their spirituality.3 Among the Franciscans, Bonaventure famously prized Hugh as one of the highest authorities. For the threefold division of sacred scripture’s teaching on faith, morals, and the contemplative end of both (in God), Bonaventure recommended authors for each: Augustine and Anselm for faith, Gregory the Great and Bernard of Clairvaux for morals, and Pseudo-Dionysius and Richard of Saint Victor for contemplation. ‘But Hugh [of Saint Victor] excels in all three’.4 Other Franciscans shared his admiration for the Victorines, particularly for Thomas Gallus.5 Dante placed Hugh and Richard of Saint-Victor in the circle of the wise in Paradise,\n\nConstant Mews, ‘Memories of William of Champeaux: The Necrology and the Early Years of SaintVictor’, in Legitur in Necrologio Victorino: Studien zum Nekrolog der Abtei Saint-Victor zu Paris, ed. by Anette Löffler and Björn Gebert, CV, 7 (Munster: Aschendorff, 2015), pp. 78–86; pp. 71–97. 2 See Julian Führer, ‘L’Abbaye de Saint-Victor dans la réforme canoniale’, in L’École de Saint-Victor de Paris: Influence et rayonnement du Moyen Âge à l’Époque moderne, ed. by Dominique Poirel, BV, 22 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 57–77.

The present volume offers collected essays introducing the thought of three preeminent Victorines: Hugh of St Victor, Richard of St Victor, and Thomas Gallus. Hugh of Saint Victor (d. 1141) was the first and greatest master of the school and set its direction with an ambitious pedagogical and theological programme. Richard (d. 1173) was its second great master, who presumed much of Hugh’s programme and pressed further into spiritual and contemplative heights. Thomas Gallus or Thomas of Saint Victor (d. 1246), often called the ‘last of the great Victorines’, bequeathed works of great learning and richness, whose influence is only recently becoming recognized. Translations, articles, and monographs have brought attention to more obscure members of the school.9 Hugh, Richard, and Thomas Gallus exhibit diverse projects and thought, though animated by the Victorine spirit. This volume’s studies focus on the greatest Victorines so as to invite us into the treasury of Victorine thought and the larger Victorine school. This introduction has five parts, with each part aiming to frame a context of the Victorines and Victorine studies, concluding with a synthetical overview of the volume’s articles. The first section situates the Victorines within a larger historical 6 Dante, Paradiso, x–xiii, x. 131–32 (Riccardo, che a considerar fu più che viro), xii. 133; for translation, see Paradiso, ed. and trans. by Robert M.

For a careful study of reformers’ uses of Hugh in particular, see Torsten Edstam’s dissertation: ‘From Twelfth-Century Renaissance to Fifteenth-Century Reform: The Reception of Hugh of St Victor in the Later Middle Ages’ (unpublished dissertation, University of Chicago, 2014). For a case study of Victorine influence, Grover Zinn studied the diffusion of Hugh’s treatise De institutione novitiorum (Formation of Novices): ‘Vestigia victorina: Victorine Influence on Spiritual Life in the Middle Ages with Special Reference to Hugh of Saint-Victor’s De institutione novitiorum’, in L’École de Saint-Victor de Paris: Influence et rayonnement du Moyen Âge à l’Époque moderne, ed. by Dominique Poirel, BV, 22 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2010), pp. 405–31. 9 Particularly worthy of attention is the ambitious translation enterprise in Victorine Texts in Translation, presently preparing its seventh volume with Brepols.The twenty-six volumes of the Bibliotheca Victorina present an invaluable mine of scholarship, likewise published with Brepols. See the volume’s bibliography.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nro be rt j p o rwo l l\n\ntrajectory of reform movements. Although the regular canons of Saint-Victor were rooted in the Carolingian program of clerical reform, they also sprung from renewed effort for clerical reform under the eleventh-century papal reform movement (often referred to as the Gregorian reforms). The second section focuses upon the Abbey of Saint-Victor as a phenomenon of the political and social landscape of Paris, the royal Capetian court of Louis VI, and the tension with the reformist party. Saint-Victor took on a mediatory role between royalists and reformists that won it respect and prestige and so advanced the restoration of the Church. Third, Saint-Victor had a direct relationship with the new Parisian schools that were giving rise to the proto-scholastic and scholastic forms of education. The Victorines distinguished themselves from these schools by directing their moral and intellectual education as preparation for church reformers. Victorine formation increased Saint-Victor’s influence, as many houses invited Victorine canons to take positions as ecclesiastical leaders (bishops, abbots, cardinals, masters) and this influence served to promote the cause of reform. In order to provide background to these figures, the fourth section offers brief introductions to the lives of Hugh, Richard, and Thomas, whose thought the volume chiefly examines. Finally, the fifth and final section concludes by offering brief comments highlighting some of the thematic syntheses arising out of the articles of the volume. ***\n\nThe Emergence of the Regular Canons While the particular order of Saint-Victor was founded in the early twelfth century, the Victorines were part of a larger reforming and spiritual movement of the regular canons. This section will sketch the origins, development, and aims of the clerical reform movements that produced the canons regular, including those of Saint-Victor Abbey. A ‘canon’ (canonicus, an ecclesiastical term that emerged in the late sixth century) was a priest or cleric who was listed on the episcopal canon rolls of a supervising bishop. Canons were clergy who were attached to a large, public church and sometimes would live in community under a rule of some kind. Unlike western monks, who after Charlemagne were largely Benedictine, disparate rules and customs might govern canons, some stricter, some laxer. Further, canons were uncloistered and likely to have pastoral duties, such as preaching or administering sacraments.10 Decrees on canons played an important role in the Carolingian reform\n\n10 For a brief overview of canons, see Michel Parisse, ‘Les Chanoines avant les Chanoines Réguliers’, in Les Chanoines réguliers: Émergence et expansion (xie–xiiie siècles), ed. by Michel Parisse (Saint-Étienne: Publications de l’Université de Saint-Étienne, 2009), pp. 7–11; See also J. C. Dickinson, The Origins of the Austin Canons and Their Introduction into England (London: S.P.C.K., 1950), pp. 13–19; Cf. Charles\n\ni nt ro d u ct i o n\n\nprogrammes but later were renovated as regular canons (or canons regular) with stricter disciplines. These renovations emerged as part of the larger movement for clerical reform in the eleventh-century papal reform programmes. In short, the canons emerged from Carolingian reforms, but that Carolingian model later seemed unsatisfactory, and a heightened reform model produced the regular canons (distinct from the secular canons). The Carolingian court made special efforts to stabilize the administration of its vast, newly-conquered realm. Special attention was paid (by Charlemagne and his heir, Louis the Pious) for ecclesial reforms, including standardization, improvement, and maintenance of churches. Imperial monastic reforms — increasing austerity, elaborations of the liturgy, and uniformly adopting the Rule of Benedict — reached its programmatic zenith at the synods at Aachen in 816–817.11 Reforms of the clergy were an early and important of this programme, albeit less well-known. Early Carolingian reformers developed roles for canons in the local administration and care of souls (cura animarum) under episcopal supervision.12 In these efforts, canons emerged not only as subjects of reforms but also as its instruments or implementors.13 Bishop Chrodegang of Metz (d. 766) followed up on the reforming efforts of Boniface of Mainz and sought to organize the ecclesiastical structures to create a larger spiritual culture among the previously disparate and fragmentary localities within Francia.14 Among his efforts for clerical and monastic reform, he borrowed much from the Rule of Benedict and regularized his canons into a community. He composed a Rule for Canons (Regula canonicorum) for the canons of his cathedral of St Stephen of Metz, which began with a reforming note: Clamat nobis Scriptura divina: ‘Omnis qui se exaltat, humiliabitur; et qui se humiliat, exaltabitur’ (Luc.

Echoing Benedict’s Rule, Chrodegang saw humility as the first foundation of the clerical community.16 His canon was to live a disciplined life, devoting himself to the divine office and to the pastoral care of souls: …Decernimus ut omnes sint unanimes officiis divinis lectionibusque sacris assidui, atque ad oboedientiam episcopi sui praepositique, ut ordo canonicus deposcit, parati, caritate conexi, zelo bono ferventissimoque amore coniuncti… (…We have determined that all should be of one mind in the worship of God, and diligent in spiritual reading … readily obedient to their bishop … as the canonical order requires. They should be united in charity, joined together in eager zeal and fervent love.17) Chrodegang took as his model the apostolic community from Acts. He saw this apostolic community as the ancient model that his clerical reform efforts sought to restore.18 In this way, Chrodegang aimed to promote a regular clergy (that is, under the discipline of his rule), adopt Roman customs, and form canonical communities. After his death (in 766), his clerical program received the support of Charlemagne and subsequent Carolingians.19 In this legacy, Chrodegang paralleled the Benedictine reformer Benedict on Aniane (d. 812) whose monastic reforming project survived him and received royal endorsement under Louis the Pious with the Monastic Capitulary of Aachen in 816–817.20 This capitulary aimed to spread and enforce the monastic reforms, particularly in uniformity and fidelity to the Benedictine Rule. Similarly, the decrees of Aachen served to promote canonical reform. Much of Chrodegang’s Rule was incorporated into a greatly expanded Formation of Canons (Institutio canonicorum), which set out a common life and standards for canons as well as for women religious (Institutio sanctimonialium).21 In the following years, bishops set up many canonical communities in cathedrals and prominent churches, though canonical observance\n\n15 Chrodegang, Regula Sancti Chrodogangi, i; See The Chrodegang Rules: The Rules for the Common Life of the Secular Clergy from the Eighth and Ninth Centuries.

This higher standard for canonical life gradually began to appear in canons’ texts. The phrases ‘to live communally, to live under a rule, to live religiously (communiter vivere, regulariter vivere, religiose vivere)’ appeared in the canons’ texts to describe their ideal way of life.24 One of the first such regular communities was the Abbey of Saint-Ruf, which began by episcopal permission in 1039.25 The canons of Saint-Ruf set out a vision of the canonical life as distinct from lax and proud ecclesiastics who were given bishoprics ‘not through spiritual gifting but through earthly lucre’ and who were ‘forgetful of the humility and religious grace they ought to keep, [and] are converted to arrogant haughtiness and pride’. The wealth these ‘worldly men unjustly possess’ ought instead to maintain the poor and clerics.26 The canons of Saint-Ruf held to a ‘model of the common life of the clergy without property (sine proprio) [that] went beyond the recommendation of the Carolingian reformers, who left the canons the possibility of owning personal property’.27 Saint-Ruf enjoyed great success in creating a network of federated regular canonical houses.28 Moreover, Saint-Ruf ’s reformed model became the ‘archetype’ of this second wave of clerical reform that\n\n22 See Deriene’s discussion of the implementation and expansion of the canonic rule following Aachen, ‘Chanoines’, pp. 366–75. 23 Derienne, ‘Chanoines’, pp. 368–75, 372; Châtillon, ‘La crise de l’Église’, pp. 10–11. 24 Charles Dereine ‘Vie commune, Règle de saint Augustin et chanoines réguliers au xie siècle’, Revue d’Histoire ecclésiastique, 41 (1946), 388; Châtillon, ‘La crise de l’Église’, p. 13. 25 Châtillon, ‘La crise de l’Église’, pp. 13–15, 28–29; Dickinson, The Origins of the Austin Canons, pp. 27–28. 26 Codex diplomaticus ordinis sancti Rufi, ed. by Ulysse Chevalier (Valence: Jules Céas et fils, 1891) 1; The unparaphrased text runs: ‘… Ac postquam hujus provincie episcopi, non per donum spirituale, sed per terrenum lucrum in sede episcopali sublimati sunt, per superbam elationem et in tumorem conversi, humiliates et religionis gratie, quam firmiter tenere debuerant, obliti sunt, ac per hoc opes et predia dicte Dei ecclesie, unde pauperes et clerici sustentari debuerant, mundiales homines possident injuste…’. 27 Yannick Veyrenche, ‘Chanoines réguliers et sociétés méridionales: L’abbaye de Saint-Ruf et ses prieurés dans le Sud-Est de la France (xie–xive siècle)’, Bulletin du centre d’études médiévales d’Auxerre, 17.2 (2013), pp. 1–8, here p. 2.

Working actively to reform the clergy in Italy, Damian penned several works articulating the spirituality and goals of the reformed canons.32 For Damian, the role of the canons was to instruct others in word and deed and to be exemplars of the gospel for all those around them. Such exemplarity was impossible without the bonds of love, but the canonry could only be a school of love through common property. ‘Where there is a division of goods, there is, no doubt, not unanimity. For love produces communion, but greed division’.33 Communal life in or near their church also offered canons a practical remedy against the temptation to concubinage or inchastity. Property and revenues ought not be held and received individually but pooled and shared as communal goods.34 In articulating these two characteristics so forcefully — communal life and communal property — Damian sowed the seed of the movement of the canons regular.35\n\n30 For an account of the regular canons in this earlier phase of papal reform, see Yannick Veyrenche, ‘Quia vos estis qui sanctorum patrum vitam probabilem renovetis… Naissance des chanoines réguliers, jusqu’à Urbain II’, in Les Chanoines réguliers: Émergence et expansion (xie–xiiie siècles): Actes du sixième colloque international du CERCOR, Le Puy en Velay, 29 juin–1er juillet 2006, ed. by Michel Parisse (Saint-Étienne: Université de Saint-Étienne, 2009), pp. 29–69. 31 For an overview of Peter’s life and work, see Anderson, The Great Catholic Reformers,pp. 30–55. 32 Chief among these works might be Damian’s letter to the canons at Fano (Epistle 39, De communi vita canonicorum; MGH I) and letter to Alexander II (Epistle 98, Contra clericos regulares proprietarios). 33 Peter Damian, ‘Ubi vero divisio rerum, ibi proculdubio non est unitas animorum.

Ranft here resonated with the work of Caroline Bynum who argued that the canonical spirituality distinguished itself from monastic spirituality in its instructional role. All monks were to be students of each other, humble learners from all. Canons likewise sought to learn from all but also to prepare themselves to instruct others, to be others’ teachers. See Caroline Walker Bynum, ‘The Spirituality of Regular Canons in the Twelfth Century’, in Caroline Walker Bynum, Jesus as Mother: Studies in the Spirituality of the High Middle Ages (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982), pp. 22–58.

See Augustin Fliche, La réforme grégorienne I: Formation des idées grégoriennes (Louvain: Spicilegium sacrum Lovaniense, 1924), i, 337. Others have noticed Damien’s founding role. Cf. Ranft, The Theology of Peter Damian, p. 143; Dickinson also so credited Damian, Dickinson, The Origins of the Austin Canons, pp. 27, 34–35.\n\ni nt ro d u ct i o n\n\nThrough this eleventh-century movement, then, the distinction grew between secular canons, (seculares) who maintained customary practices allowed by the Carolingian reforms, and the regular canons (regulares, for those living under a rule or regula), who adopted, advocated, and spread this emerging new canonical model.36 Damian encountered resistance from secular canons who could defend their custom of individual property as their Carolingian rule allowed (Institutio canonicorum, § 115, 122). The crux of the dispute lay in the conception of the ideal of the common apostolic life. Chrodegang’s Rule pointed back to the ancient ideal of common property under apostolic leadership: ‘None dared to call anything their own property but “all was common for them” and hence they were said to have “one heart and one soul” (Acts 4. 32)’.37 The rule from Aachen (Institutio canonicorum) had allowed more latitude and individual property (§ 115), but it also bore the apostolic ideal quoted in Augustine’s sermon citing the apostolic ideal: Ut ergo non vos diu teneam, praesertim quia ego sedens loquor, vos stando laboratis, nostis autem omnes aut pene omnes sic nos vivere in ea domo, quae dicitur domus episcopii, ut, quantum possumus, imitemur eos sanctos, de quibus loquitur liber actuum apostolorum: ‘Nemo dicebat aliquid proprium, sed errant illis omnia communia’. (…All of you, or almost all, of us who live in this house, which is called the bishop’s house, so we may imitate — as much as we can — those saints about whom it is said in the Acts of the Apostles: ‘No one called anything their own but all was common for them’.)38 For Augustine, this apostolic ideal received the commendation of Paul: ‘Be imitators of me as I am of Christ (I Corinthians 4. 16)’.39 While earlier canonical texts pointed to that ancient ideal, the eleventh-century reformers sought to make the apostolic common life a living reality. To live the apostolic life was not only the remedy to the abuses that had become common in the clergy but was also imitating Christ and the Apostles. The canons saw themselves engaged in an ultimately restorative task: to re-instantiate the community of unanimity exemplified in the primitive apostolic church.40 For this reason, Hildebrand (later Gregory VII) condemned the laxity of canons and sought to have condemned the\n\n36 Châtillon, ‘La crise de l’Église’, pp. 20–23. 37 Chrodegang, Regula Sancti Chrodegangi [Regula canonicorum] § 31, in The Chrodegang Rules, ed. by Bertram, 46; ‘Licet legamus antiquam Ecclesiam sub tempore apostolorum ita unianimem concordemque extetisse et ita omnia reliquisse, ut singuli predia sua vendentes ad pedes apostolorum precia ponerent, ut nullus eorum sibi aliquid proprium dicere auderet, sed erant illis “omnia communia,” unde et habere dicebantur ‘cor unum et animam unam’ [Acts 4]…’. 38 Institutio canonicorum aquisgranesis, 112 MGH Concilia 2.1, p. 385, 18–22; This whole chapter derives from Augustine of Hippo’s Sermons, 355–56, (together titled De vita et moribus clericorum), here the quotation is from Sermon 355, 2. 39 Institutio canonicorum aquisgranesis, p. 385, 10–12. 40 Châtillon, ‘Les traits essentiels de l’idéal des premiers chanoines réguliers et leur signification dans l’Église d’aujourd’hui’, in Le Mouvement Canonial au Moyen Âge: Réforme de l’Église, Spiritualité, et Culture, ed. by Patrice Sicard (Turnhout: Brepols, 1992), pp. 47–72, here pp. 48–58.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nro be rt j p o rwo l l\n\nchapters of the Carolingian Institutio that warranted individual property.41 To evade accusations of innovation, Damian and Hildebrand could respond that the apostolic idea (Acts 4. 32–35) was not an innovation but the ancient and authoritative model for their reforms. The apostolic community, they argued, presented an exemplary and authoritative model for canons by sharing property and having ‘all in common’ (erant illis omnia communia).42 The Lateran synod of 1059 discussed these matters; its fourth canon contains their compromise position. Canons were to be celibate, live communally near their church, and share the revenues from their church, but private property was not forbidden. Yet, the conciliar canon concluded with an authorization of the apostolic ideal of communal property as the ideal to which the canons ought to strive: ‘By way of request, we urge you to strive above all to arrive at the apostolic, that is the communal, life’.43 In this short statement, the Lateran synod under Nicholas II effectively authorized the ideal of the apostolic life (vita apostolica). For this acknowledgement the synod has been called the ‘birth certificate of the new order’ of canons regular.44 To live apostolically in one heart and one soul entailed not only communal living, meals, and goods, but also a regulated way of life. Previously, the Carolingian Formation (Institutio) functioned as a rule, but it was lengthy and unwieldy. In the latter eleventh century, various Rules of Augustine emerged. Unlike the relatively stable Rule of Benedict, the Augustinian Rules varied greatly in their content and in their connection to Augustine. Luc Verheijen’s magisterial research distinguished four rules: the First Rule (Regula prima or Regula consensoria), the Order of the Monastery (Ordo monasterii), the Precept or Third Rule (Praeceptum or Regular tertia), and the Reprimand (Obiurgatio, based on Augustine’s Letter 211 to women religious).45 Though often adapted, combined, and edited in various ways, it was the Precept that eventually gained widest adoption and diffusion, and many regular canons and other orders adopted a version of it.46 An attractive quality of the Augustinian Rule (hereafter referred to as the Praeceptum) was its emphasis on building an evangelical community of fraternal love. From its outset, it makes explicit reference to the Acts model (§ 2–3). Unanimity and communal life are central: ‘First, you have been gathered into one so that you will dwell with unanimity in the house and there will\n\n41 Dickinson, The Origins of the Austin Canons, pp. 30–32, Veyrenche, ‘Quia vos estis’, pp. 33–34. 42 Acts 4. 32 Biblia Sacra Vulgata. 43 G.

Sic enim legitis in Actibus Apostolorum, quia ‘erant illis omnia communia et distribuebatur unicuique sicut cuique opus erat’. (And do not call anything property, but let all be common for you and let your food and dress be distributed to each by your superior, for you cannot all be equal but rather for each according to what each needed. For so you read in Acts of the Apostles that ‘all was common for them and was distributed to each as each needed’.)48 By contrast, the Rule of Benedict began by establishing a very different relationship of an elder to a younger (‘Listen, my son, to the teachings of the master and incline the ear of your heart’).49 While Benedict emphasized humble obedience to the abbot in the complex work of prayer (opus Dei), the Rule of Augustine urged common, apostolic life in evangelical poverty through harmonious fraternal love. It was also more flexible as it left out detailed prescriptions for daily activities and living arrangements. The pursuit of the apostolic life under the Rule of Augustine would spread from its humble beginnings far beyond the horizons of the reformers of the eleventh century, eventually animating the new models of the mendicant orders in the thirteenth.50 Woven into this apostolic life, the life of the regular canon was a pastoral office. Unlike monastic reform movements that tended toward deserted places — particularly the Cistercians, who sought uncultivated wastes — churches with canonries were usually in larger urban centres.51 As an apostolic community in urban centres, regular canons aimed outward, at the pastoral care of souls (cura animarum). Their roles included maintaining churches, ministering sacraments, teaching, and preaching.52 The charismatic St Norbert of Xanten, a wandering preacher, founded the order of canons called Premonstratensians (named for their first community in Prémontré; they\n\n47 Veheijen, La Règle de saint Augustin, i, 417; ‘Primum propter quod in unum estis congregati, ut unianimes habitetis in domo et sit vobis anima et cor unum in deum.’ 48 Veheijen, La Règle de saint Augustin, i, 418. 49 Sancti Benedicti Regula, Prol.; ‘Obsculta, o fili, praecepta magistri et inclina aurem cordis tui…’ 50 M.

The communal, apostolic Premonstratensians prized hospitality, poverty, and preaching.53 The spirituality of the canons also differed from that of the monks. In many ways, the regular canons looked to monastic models for imitation and borrowing. Some regular canons, such as the Premonstratensians, borrowed Cistercian customs for their communities.54 Yet, as Caroline Bynum argued, even though monks and canons largely held similar ideals and models, canons differed by conceiveing of themselves not only as learners but also as teachers.55 Monks wrote to one another, exhorting that each learn from the other in humility and mutual obedience, according to Benedict’s Rule. Canons also sought to learn from one another but added something else: a new responsibility to teach and edify their fellows by their deeds and by words (exemplo et verbo, vita et doctrina).56 Bynum wrote: What canons were voicing was something new: a sense of the individual’s responsibility for his fellows, both within and outside the cloister… They felt a commitment to educate others that was no longer attached to the role of the preacher or leader, a commitment that gave new importance to example as well as speech.57 Living communally with one another and in the rising urban centres, the canons’ legacy adds a new direction: their contemplation pours out into teaching one another, their spirituality spills out of the cloister for their neighbours, in edification and invitation to a higher moral and spiritual aim. From its beginning with Saint-Ruf in southern France and in Italy, the movement of regular canons spread north into Germany, and especially flourished in northern France.58 Northern French houses of regular canons included the later order of Prémontré (of St Norbert of Xanten), as well as the federation of Arrouaise, SaintQuentin of Beauvais, and the Order of Saint-Victor.59 Having broadly and rapidly sketched the emergence of the regular canons — pursuing a vision of apostolic life for pastoral care of souls — as part of the wider reforming movements, we turn to focus on the Abbey of Saint-Victor in its Parisian context.\n\n53 For a short account of the St Norbert’s order, see Lawrence, Medieval Monasticism, pp. 167–68.

The Parisian environment was not incidental but set the stage for Saint-Victor’s balance between reformist and royalist parties. The city’s history traces back to Julius Caesar’s conquest of the Gallic Parisii (c. 50 bce), whose town of Lutetia was later named Île de la Cité.60 Afterward, Roman Lutetia was refounded on the left bank of the Seine River (on the hill later named Monte Sainte-Geneviève), on a grid whose central axis became the Rue-St-Jacques. The transport from the Seine and the traffic of its north-south and east-west crossroads made Lutetia prominent first as a Roman then as a Frankish city. While Charlemagne showed the city no special favour, this former Merovingian capital became again the capital of the Capetian dynasty in the late tenth century.61 Just over a century later, we find the Abbey of Saint-Victor, deeply entangled in its historical environment of early twelfth-century Paris. To recognize Saint-Victor’s role in its Parisian context, this section will map the agenda of the Capetian King Louis VI and the tensions with the French reformist network. The Abbey of Saint-Victor succeeded in establishing itself as a centre of reform as well as gaining a valuable mediating role between the parties. The French crown held a tenuous rule in the eleventh century. After the Carolingian collapse in the ninth century, the royal lands or demesne had been reduced to a small territory in the environs of Paris, sandwiched between the powerful counties of Blois to the West, Champagne to the East, and the duchy of Normandy to the North. Philip I (1060–1108) was the fourth Capetian monarch, but he was the first of that line to avoid loss of control or land over any part of his hitherto shrinking royal demesne.62 Instead, Philip engaged in a policy of aggressive defence and annexation. Philip forcefully impressed this expansionist policy onto his son and heir, Louis VI (associated in 1098, crowned in 1108). Louis VI spent much of his reign on campaign against nearby castellans and barons. Despite long odds and much resistance, Louis was quite effective. Not only did he maintain royal holdings, but he also significantly expanded them. He won by conquest the submission of quite a few troublesome neighbours, and he greatly improved the royal administration, strengthening and extending the reach of his prévôts (royal agents in charge of justice and revenue).63\n\n60 Julius Caesar, The Gallic Wars in Caeser I, vii. 4, trans. by H.

Suger’s Life of Louis the Fat portrayed Louis as a vigorous and pious champion for the poor and churches against the unjust predations of nobles and knights.65 Yet, despite Suger’s image of Louis as defender of the church, the king’s ecclesiastical policies produced tensions with church officials. Frankish realms had not experienced the same tumult resulting from the papal investiture reforms as had the Holy Roman Empire. The Capetian kings generally had not provoked conflict, until Philip I became the first French king to be excommunicated. The cause lay when Philip dismissed his wife Bertha and took as wife Bertrade de Montfort, the spouse of Count Fulk of Anjou. Though it was a scandalous act, two archbishops and eight bishops confirmed the illicit royal marriage in Rheims.66 In this we may see an accommodation between nobles and ecclesiastics that had become customary; however, against this accomodation, a newer party asserted itself. Bishop Ivo of Chartres — the canonist and one-time regular canon at Saint-Quentin at Beauvais — in alliance with papal legate Hugh of Die and other reformist prelates reversed the confirmation and excommunicated Philip. Philip repeatedly received excommunication and reconciliations for a decade (1094–1104) as he struggled against the reformists. After this affair concluded, two parties emerged in a tense relationship but rarely came into open conflict: in one party were the more traditional royalists and ecclesiastics who saw strong Capetian power as the path to order and justice in the realm. The other party was the reformist network, inspired by the papal reform movement and resonating among the religious movements. These movements included the Cluniacs, Cistercians, and houses of the new regular canons, as well as the pope and his episcopal allies. While upholding clerical celibacy and the ban on simony, the reformists also sought to disentangle religious offices from nobles and court officers, who dominated these offices and even collected them for their powers and revenues.67 The reformist could point to the person of Stephen of Garland as an archetype of corruption. The Garland family had been loyal supporters of Philip through his excommunications, and they received royal favour in return.

Gilbert of Garland served as royal butler (with responsibilities in the royal household).68 Stephen had the most glittering career. In his person he joined the offices of royal chancellor, seneschal, and private counsellor to the king. His varied offices granted him such power that it prompted the chronicler of the Abbey of Morigny to refer to him bitterly as ‘Stephen … by whose counsel all France was governed’.69 What perturbed the reformists was that Stephen also held many ecclesial positions: he was archdeacon of Notre-Dame, dean of the canonry of Ste-Geneviève, dean of Saint-Samson of Orléans, dean of SainteCroix of Orléans, dean of Saint-Aignan Abbey (Orléans), a canon of Notre-Dame of Étampes, provost of Spedona, and provost of Soissons.70 This multiplication of offices, the concomitant concentration of revenue and powers, and especially the mixture of royal and ecclesiastical offices were repugnant to the reformers. And Stephen had appetite for more: he had sought twice to gain a bishopric. In 1100, under the then-excommunicated Philip, the royally-inclined clergy of Beauvais elected Stephen bishop, but he was blocked from taking that office first by Ivo of Chartres and then by Pope Paschal II.71 In 1114, the see of Beauvais again became vacant. Stephen sought to transfer the current bishop of Paris and reformist opponent, Galon, to Beauvais and then to take the Parisian bishopric for himself. This effort too came to nothing.72 Stephen of Garland, then, was the type of a model of ecclesial and aristocratic ambition whose efforts to strengthen central, royal power now collided with the programmes and protests of the newer reformist party.73 Stephen certainly had nobility and clergy on his side. Abbot Suger’s Benedictine abbey was royalist. The secular\n\n68 Einar Joranson’s unpublished thesis Stephen Garland (at University of Wisconsin, 1914) usefully collated the many scattered references to this central but elusive figure. It is a surprising gap that no more thorough or recent study of Stephen seems to have been done. See Joranson, ‘Stephen Garland’ (unpublished masters thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1914).

It is better to recognize that both parties sought reforms though of different kinds. Suger, Abelard, Heloise (etc) were allies or protected by the royalists, but they enacted (or attempted) their own ideas of reform. Likewise, Gilduin of Saint-Victor, Peter the Venerable of Cluny,\n\n25\n\n26\n\nro be rt j p o rwo l l\n\ncanons of Ste-Geneviève, where Abelard taught, resisted the regular canons’ reforms and supported Stephen as their dean. The canonry of Notre Dame, where Stephen was archdeacon, was also secular and a prestigious chapter that attracted wealthy, influential, and connected men.74 Reformists such as Ivo of Chartres, archdeacon and master, and Archdeacon William of Champeaux, Bishop Stephen of Senlis, and Bernard of Clairvaux were bitterly opposed to Stephen and what he represented.75 In 1127, Bernard sought to persuade Abbot Suger to withdraw support from Stephen, whom he denounced as a civil-ecclesiastical monster: [Quod plane credibilius ex eo videtur, quia cum honores non paucos, sed quantos nec canones nisi inviti patiuntur, teneat in Ecclesia;] unius tamen, quem in palatio assecutus est, magis, ut aiunt, gloriatur ex nomine quam ceterorum quolibet appellari. Cumque sit archidiaconus, decanus, praepositusque in diversis ecclesiis, nihil horum tamen tam eum quam regis delectat vocitari dapiferum… Confundit penitus ordines et utroque officio delicate satis abutitur, dum et hinc eum delectat pompa, non militia saecularis, et illinc quaestus, non cultus religionis. (This seems the more probable, because he is prouder (they say) to be called by the name of that one post which he has obtained at the palace [chancellor] than by any of those titles of ecclesiastical dignities which, in defiance of the canons, he has heaped upon himself, and instead of delighting to be called Archdeacon, Dean, or Provost to his various Churches, he prefers to be styled Dapifer… This man mingles the two orders [courtly and ecclesiastical] and cunningly abuses each. Military pomps delight him, but not the risks and labours of warfare; the revenues of religion, but not its duties.)76 In charge of Louis’ army and many churches, Stephen was mixing the orders that the papal reformers sought to disentangle. Moreover, as Bernard objected, Stephen enjoyed the prestige of royal office and lined his pockets by the revenues of many ecclesiastical offices but remained spiritually a pauper. In the context of the tension between royalist and secular canons against reformists and regular canons, then, we return to the origins of Saint-Victor in 1108, with which we started. In 1108, William of Champeaux was a secular canon, archdeacon, and master of Notre Dame, but he renounced his individual revenues and later left that canonry.\n\nand other were reformists but also supported the Capetian crown and received its patronage. See Constant Mews ‘Bernard of Clairvaux and Peter Abelard’, in Cambridge Companion to Bernard of Clairvaux, ed. by Brian P McGuire (Boston: Brill, 2011), pp. 134–68, especially pp. 134–35. 74 Matthew Doyle’s recent work on the individuals of the Notre Dame canonry in the mid-twelfth century provides a very useful window into its culture, even though a few decades later than William of Champeaux’s time. Stephen of Garland was still a canon when Peter Lombard entered in 1145. See Peter Lombard and His Students (Toronto: PIMS, 2016), pp. 52–80. 75 Bernard of Clairvaux’s Epistle 78 (in 1127, shortly before Stephen’s downfall) intends to turn Suger against Stephen and alluded to the many grievances held against him. 76 Bernard of Clairvaux, Sancti Bernardi Opera Vol. 7: Epistolae, ed. by J. LeClercq, OSB and H. Rochais (Rome: Editiones Cistercienses, 1974), Ep. 78, 11–12. Cf. Ep. 27, 11–12; Some Letters of Saint Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, trans. by Samuel Eales (London: Ballantyne Press, 1904). Emphasis added.\n\ni nt ro d u ct i o n\n\nPeter Abelard, once a student of William, claimed in his History of My Calamities that William retired because he desired ecclesiastical promotion.77 Yet the context shows that by renouncing individual revenue and departing the secular canons, William was aligning himself as a reformer, and his subsequent projects fit that programme. That is how William’s peers understood his move. Beforehand, William had worked closely with reformist bishop of Paris, Galon.78 Afterward, the prominent reforming bishop Hildebert of Lavardin sent William a letter congratulating him for beginning to philosophize truly and for following Christ’s exhortations: ‘You have embraced that evangelical counsel that the youth heard from Christ: “Go, sell all you have and give it to the poor and come follow me” (Mark 10. 21)’.79 Shortly after, William did receive promotion to the bishopric of Châlons-sur-Marne, in which office he worked closely with Cuno of Praeneste, papal legate and regular canon (of Arrouaise). He also helped launch the career of Bernard of Clairvaux by confirming him abbot and giving spiritual guidance to the zealous youth.80 The newly founded Abbey of Saint-Victor needed to navigate these Parisian troubled waters. Though William probably used his pull, Saint-Victor was only founded and chartered after his departure. In 1113, as part of a larger settlement between the parties, Louis VI revised a recent grant he had made for a community of canons regular in Puiseaux (south of Paris, midway to Orléans, in 1112).81 The grant now established the Abbey of Saint-Victor just outside Paris, within a kilometre of Abelard’s school at Ste-Geneviève.82 Louis’ grant was a rich endowment that supported the prosperity and stability of the abbey.83 As Fourier Bonnard pointed out, Saint-Victor’s charter granted the right of free election (a reforming goal and marker). Saint-Victor soon elected Prior Gilduin as its first abbot.84 Gilduin was thought to be one of William’s students and was — as Constant Mews argued — the ‘true founder of Saint-Victor’.85 Written years later, the Necrology of Saint-Victor also emphasized Gilduin’s restorative leadership: he ‘restored the canonical life that had decayed almost completely. During his days, our house held primacy over other houses of our Order and he projected the 77 Peter Abelard, The Letters of Abelard and Heloise, trans. by Betty Radice (New York: Penguin, 2003), pp. 4–5. 78 Constant J.

Saint-Victor indeed flourished under Gilduin. In a few years it was a recognized intellectual giant. It was both a bulwark of the reformers as well as prestigious in the royal court, and respected more widely. This bridging role allowed Saint-Victor to broker agreements in partisan disputes. In 1126–1127, Abbot Gilduin and a Victorine prior joined a commission to adjudicate a dispute between reformist bishop Stephen of Senlis and his cathedral chapter (of secular canons). Both sides trusted the Victorines for a fair settlement.87 Gilduin held the king’s respect and reverence: Suger recorded that Louis VI on his deathbed called for Gilduin and made intimate confession to him.88 On another occasion, King Louis VII intervened in the abbatial election at the Abbey of Morigny by sending three men to decide the election. The chronicler named the three: an abbot, a bishop, and Hugh, master of Saint-Victor, ‘who surpassed a host of masters in literature’.89 Saint-Victor’s wide respect brought it growth and influence. In addition to Louis VI’s generous charter, Gilbert, bishop of Paris, secured copious funds to continue building Saint-Victor, beginning in 1116.90 Stephen of Senlis, Gilbert’s episcopal successor, was a strong reformer and actively aided Saint-Victor in reforming other houses and abbeys, including the chapter at Ste-Geneviève (in 1148), despite strong resistance from that chapter. He twice attempted to bring Victorines into the Notre Dame chapter to reform it.91 In 1133, the zealous Prior Thomas of Saint-Victor was en route to reform a religious house at Chelles when his party were ambushed by men connected with Stephen of Garland. Prior Thomas was slain. Unable or unwilling to prosecute the culprits, the king attempted to mollify the reformers with further gifts.92 In 1136, Pope Innocent II elevated a Victorine named Ivo of Chartres (not to be confused with the canonist and bishop of the same name) to be a cardinal deacon.93 Yet Saint-Victor, by its royal endowment, its earned prestige, and intellectual 86 I have adopted Mews’ translation of the text from the Necrologium.

For all its practical reforming projects, Saint-Victor bequeathed a legacy of a very different sort. It was the intellectual and spiritual life of Saint-Victor that became its last fruit. This spiritual and intellectual culture will receive brief treatment in the next section.\n\nSaint-Victor as Educational and Reforming Centre From its beginning, Saint-Victor was characterized by its school culture. A proper treatment of Victorine school culture exceeds present scope. This brief section will suggest that Victorine teaching and learning took place within its larger programme for reforming the Church. Beginning with the Carolingian reforms, as we have seen, canons were not only the object of reform but also its subjects who would implement and continue those reforms. Roughly two centuries later in the papal-led reform movement, the Acts ideal of communal living and property animated a second wave of reform (leading to the distinction between the secular and regular canons). The regular canons developed a spirituality not only of humble learning, but edification by word and deed of their fellows and their neighbours. The reform movement that included the regular canons not only formed a network in northern France but also encountered resistance with the royalist party, who sought civil reforms by strengthening the Capetian monarchy. For this reformist party, Saint-Victor become both a bulwark and a mediator, maintaining respect and pull with Louis VI’s court. Saint-Victor’s school culture was central to its reform program for cultivating a model abbey with strict discipline (for morals) and a high standard educational and intellectual standard (for contemplation). In this way, Saint-Victor would form its canons for advancement to higher ecclesial office, where they could carry on reforming efforts in the Church. William sowed the seeds of the community with his students from the school of Notre Dame. After William’s departure, a few years may have intervened before Hugh arrived and began teaching at its school (by 1120). By his teaching, he established a vibrant school culture at Saint-Victor alongside the active and multiplying proto-scholastic schools of Paris. The school of Saint-Victor attracted many students and produced remarkable figures. Like many abbeys, Saint-Victor held an internal school for members of the community and an external school for those outside the community. Hugh’s external school remained open throughout Gilduin’s abbacy and became first-rate in Paris, the city that was rapidly becoming a dominant school city.94\n\n94 Godfrey of Saint-Victor, first a student in other Parisian schools, gravitated to Saint-Victor, became a member, and wrote his encomium of its school culture in Fons philosophiae. See The Fountain of Philosophy, trans. by Edward Synan (Toronto: PIMS, 1972).\n\n29\n\n30\n\nro be rt j p o rwo l l\n\nIn the larger context of twelfth-century learning, Paris was witnessing great transitions. In the previous decades, cathedral schools and monasteries were the chief sites of education.95 By the end of the twelfth century, the nascent university of Paris had formed, and a very different scholastic culture had emerged.96 In between was a vital period of transition between these more stable school cultures. In this period of transformation, independent teachers such as Peter Abelard sought to attract students (and their fees) by experimenting with teaching and pedagogies. There was significant latitude for experimentation and innovation, and so masters competed for students and reputation as pedagogical rivals. Alongside these variations taking place in the contemporary Parisian schools, the school of Saint-Victor offered its own experiment in learning and study.97 Saint-Victor’s programme was a pedagogy to form and to restore humanity. While other communities of regular canons focused on preaching, liturgy, or other pastoral practices, the Victorines — especially Hugh and Richard — sought to link studies with contemplation, erudition with ardent love for God.98 The Abbey of Saint-Victor stood within the Parisian sphere, and Hugh, its first master, developed his own pedagogical programme for an experimental school culture as a deliberate alternative to the teaching of the Parisian masters.99 Hugh’s pedagogy had two bases: discipline (disciplina) and teaching (doctrina). Discipline restores morals and eventually love (hence, it is ultimately affective), and teaching educates the\n\n95 For the culture of the eleventh-century cathedral schools, see the prominent study by C.

Together, discipline and teaching lead to virtue.100 Led by Gilduin and Hugh, Saint-Victor’s spiritual and intellectual formation advanced the larger cause of clerical and ecclesial reform. Master Hugh’s programme prepared his novices and canons with discipline and knowledge, which he understood to be dual necessities for ecclesial office. In his Sacraments of the Christian Faith, Hugh described the cleric as ‘God’s messenger to the people’ who required discipline and knowledge: Postquam autem clericus factus est debet deinceps de stipendiis ȩcclesiȩ sustentari et sub tutela et custodia spiritalium magistrorum scientia diuina et ecclesiastica disciplina erudiri. Quatinus ad sacros ordines ministerii diuini cum ratio poposcerit digne possit accedere. (Now after one has been made a cleric, he should be sustained by the stipends of the Church and be taught in the divine science and ecclesiastical discipline under the tutelage and custody of spiritual masters, in order that, when reason demands, he may be able worthily to enter upon the sacred orders of the divine ministry.)101 Saint-Victor, with Master Hugh at the school and Abbot Gilduin overseeing, produced canons that many sought or invited to fill ecclesial or religious offices. Only relatively rarely, though, did Hugh explicitly speak about his fellow canons as future leaders or prelates. In a Victorine sermon attributed to Hugh, the speaker exhorted his brothers not to be like the ecclesial pastors who sought only payment and fled at the approach of the wolf ( John 10. 11–13). Lupi occidunt, quia et visibiles corpora laniant et invisibiles animas necant. Si ergo pastores estis, vigilate super gregem vestrum (Luc. II); nec oves Christi lianiari permittatis in manibus vestris. Ascendite ex adverso, et date vos murum pro domo Domini. (Wolves kill because they both tear visible bodies and slay invisible souls. Therefore, if you are pastors, watch over your flock (Luke 2). Do not let Christ’s sheep be mangled in your hands. Arise from the foe and give yourself as a wall for the house of the Lord.)102\n\n100 For a more complete account of Hugh’s educational programme, see Robert Porwoll, ‘Parisian Pedagogies: The Educational Debates between Peter Abelard, Hugh of Saint-Victor, Peter Lombard, and John of Salisbury’ (unpublished dissertation, University of Chicago, 2019). Hugh’s balance between intellect and affect is echoed throughout his works. For example, see Noah’s Ark (De arca Noë morali) in Hugh of Saint-Victor: Selected Spiritual Writings, i. 1–6, ed. by Aelred Squire, OP (New York: Harper & Row, 1962), pp. 45–51. For more on Hugh’s educational program, see also Andrew Salzmann’s article in this volume. 101 Hugh of Saint Victor, De sacramentis Christiane fidei, ii. 3. 1, ed. by Rainer Berndt, CV, Textus historici, 1 (Münster: Aschendorff, 2008), p. 344.

In another rare passage, Hugh clarified for his canons how the pastor should guard his flock, that is, in terms of education: teaching and moral correction. In The Word of God, Hugh examined the duality of the inner word (the divine speaking to one inwardly) and the outer word (spoken through human voices).103 After ranging through the theological anthropology of how divine Word inwardly touches the human mind — topics surely dear to his students — Hugh concluded the outer word through the twofold duties of the prelate. Pastors bear two responsibilities: first, before God pastors owe spiritual devotion and sacrifice on behalf of the people.104 Then, as an envoy of God to the people, the pastor owes instruction to the flock: one must ‘teach the ignorant and correct sinners’.105 Rather than enforcing an overbearing or strict discipline, the pastor must both teach those needing instruction and compassionately and humbly correct those astray: ‘About that office whereby he is God’s envoy to the people, it is said, ‘let him be compassionate with the ignorant and straying, since he himself is set about with weakness’ (Hebrew 5. 2)’.106 Here the pastor’s two roles correspond to the two bases of Victorine education in formal study for knowledge and moral formation for love. Hugh, then, revealed that the educational formation of Saint-Victor aimed to equip canons for pastoral service in higher offices. Victorine formation, indeed, proved attractive to contemporaries. Many sought to give grants to Saint-Victor as a perceived bastion of reform; others affiliated their own houses with Saint-Victor or requested that a Victorine be sent to become their abbot. As a result, Saint-Victor found itself a mother house in a federated order of religious houses that adopted Victorine customs or had a Victorine as abbot.107 By the end of the twelfth century, a Victorine chronicle (Cronica abbreviata) recognized the great success of the order in daughter houses and sending forth its members for high offices: ‘The Order of Saint-Victor is spread through many churches’. The chronicler listed the prominent names: In Bituricensi archiepiscopatu fit abbas Radulfus in ecclesia sancti Satyri; domnus Odo in ecclesia beate Genovese Parisius Rogerus, in ecclesia sancti Euuitii (sic) Aurelianis; alter Rogerus in ecclesia Augensi in Normannia; domnus Garnerius in ecclesia sancti Bartholomei apud Noviomum; Balduinus in ecclesia sancti Vincentii Silvanectensis, Guibertus in ecclesia sancte Marie Alticurtis, Ricardus in ecclesia sancti Augustini de Bristo in Anglia et magister Andreas in ecclesia 103 De verbo Dei, i–ii, in Hugues de Saint-Victor: Six Opuscules spirituels, ed. by Roger Baron (Paris: Cerf, 1969), pp. 60–64. On Hugh’s De verbo Dei, see Paul Rorem, Hugh of Saint Victor, Great Medieval Thinkers (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 127. 104 Hugh, De verbo Dei, vi. 287–89; ‘In illo officio quo est legatus populi erga Deum, devotionem exhibere debet, ut eum oblationibus et sacrificio spirituali precibusque placatum reddat.’ 105 Hugh, De verbo Dei, vi. 289–91; ‘In eo officio quo est legatus Dei ad populum, ad illum pertinet ignorantes docere, peccantes corrigere.’ 106 Hugh, De verbo Dei, vi. 293–96; ‘De illo officio in quo est legatus Dei ad populum, dictum est ut sciat compati his qui ignorant et errant, quoniam et ipse circumdatus est infirmitate (Hebrews 5 .2).’ 107 See Châtillon, ‘Le crise de l’Église’, pp. 34–39.\n\ni nt ro d u ct i o n\n\nsancti Jacobi de Guiguemora, et in ecclesia Romana Ivo cardinalis et domnus Hugo Tusculanensis episcopus — hii omnes canonici sancti Victoris Parisius et discipuli domini Gilduini abbatis. Radulfus was made abbot in the archiepiscopate of Bourges in the Church of Saint Satyrus, lord Odo in the Church of Blessed Geneviève in Paris, Roger in Orléans in the Church of Saint Equitius, a second Roger in the Church of Eu in Normandy, lord Garnerius in the Church of Saint Bartholomew in Noyon, Baldwin in the Church of Saint Vincent of Senlis, Guibert in the Church of Saint Mary in Eaucourt; in England, Richard in the Church of Augustine in Bristol and master Andrew in the Church of Saint James at Wigmore [England], Cardinal Ivo in the Roman church, and lord Hugh is bishop of Tusculum: All these are canons of Saint-Victor in Paris, students of lord abbot Gilduin.108 After highlighting these ten prominent Victorines, the chronicler recalled the other members who brought prestige to the order: Magister etiam Hugo de Sancto Victore in scientia scripturarum nulli secundus in orbe, magister quoque Achardus Abricensis episcopus, prior Thomas et magister Adam in scripturis divinis adprime eruditi, prior Richardus fuerunt discipuli abbatis Gilduini. (These also were students of Abbot Gilduin: Master Hugh of Saint-Victor second to none in all the world in knowledge of letters, master Achard the bishop of Avranches, prior Thomas and master Adam who were especially learned in sacred scriptures, and prior Richard.)109 The learning and teaching of these latter Victorine luminaries had helped advance Victorine canons to become prelates who, in turn, could promote reform with a good pastor’s care. The Victorines’ legacy, then, was not only their rich theological vision and spirituality glowing with charity, but also their education for reforming leadership in their own time. The Abbey sent out canons to found daughter houses, to take office as abbots, bishops, or cardinals; this Victorines off-shoots spread the thought and discipline of Saint-Victor widely. Godfrey of Saint-Victor testified to this educational potency in his late twelfth century verses, The Fountain of Philosophy. Adopting the imagery of quenching the intellect’s thirst, Godfrey contrasted the Parisian schools’ drinks — now muddy, now intoxicating, now surfeiting, now parching — to the\n\n108 MS Lat. 15009 in Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, as transcribed in Dickinson, The Origins of the Austin Canons, pp. 284–85. ‘Ordo sancti Victoris Parisius per multas ecclesias propagatur.’ Cf.

Hauréau found an expanded list by a later chronicler in a XIV c. manuscript (shelfmark MS 475, as he reported, Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris); this expanded list was printed in Prolegomena (PL 175.cxli–cxlii). 109 Dickinson, The Origins of the Austin Canons, pp. 284–85.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nro be rt j p o rwo l l\n\nwholesome, clear fountain of the canons of Saint-Victor. From this fountain flows the medicinal draught to ease contemporary ills: Hinc effundit rudibus eruditionem, Hinc ignaris penitus dat instructionem, Hinc infirmis animis consolationem, Hinc profitentibus exhortationem. From them he pours out instruction for the unlearned, And provides teaching for those who know nothing; From them he gives consolation to weak souls, And offers exhortation to those advancing.110 Godfrey’s verses still encapsulate the ambition of Saint-Victor: all sorts — the ignorant, the dull, the weary, and the talented — may be refreshed by its instruction and so press on to their restoration.\n\nThree Short Lives Hugh\n\nHugh (d. 1141) arrived at the young and energetic Abbey of Saint-Victor around 1115.111 On account of his great learning and devotion, Hugh was remembered afterward: ‘A most learned man in sacred scriptures and secular philosophy he was lesser to none of the ancients, who was held as a most renowned doctor in his own time just as a second Augustine’.112 Like many in Paris, he was an émigré. Likely from Saxony, 110 Godfrey of Saint-Victor addressed this work to Stephen upon his elevation to the abbacy of Mont Ste-Geneviève, the site of a prominent Parisian school where Peter Abelard once taught and more recently had affiliated unto the order of Saint-Victor.

Before coming to Paris, he stayed in Marseilles along with his uncle (Archdeacon Hugh). There they had acquired relics of Saint Victor of Marseilles, and they brought these with them to Paris. The Necrology of Saint-Victor commemorated Hugh’s gift of relics of Saint Victor, the patron saint of their abbey.113 Hugh won the confidence of Gilduin quickly, and he soon began teaching as master at the abbey. As discussed earlier, Hugh’s school at Saint-Victor added to the Parisian proto-scholastic landscape but also distinguished itself from the independent schools springing up within Paris. Hugh’s teaching and writing were respected, his reading was wide, and his spiritual thought deep. The primary concern uniting all his writings was a holistic and rigorous curriculum with a sound pedagogical method. The overall success of Saint-Victor as a reforming house, as a theological force, and as a furnace of spiritual and mystical thought may be attributed in no small way to Hugh as its chief teacher and example. He aimed for reform and corresponded with Bernard of Clairvaux — the young and talented abbot of the Abbey of Clairvaux that he founded as part of the vibrant new Cistercian order.114 Yet despite these connections, he did not seem to take much part himself in projects or political manoeuvring.115 On one occasion, he obliged Louis VI by adjudicating a disputed election at the Abbey of Morigny.116 Among his final works was the monumental Sacraments of the Christian Faith. Richard\n\nRichard of Saint-Victor (d. 1173) not only continued the programme set by Gilduin and Hugh, but he also was keenly original and went beyond Hugh in cultivating mystical, contemplative thought. Attesting to his later popularity, a later biography of Richard comes to us from John of Toulouse (in 1650).117 Richard also was not\n\n113 , The Necrologium of Saint-Victor commemorates Hugh’s gift on 11 February 1141: ‘De quo et illud specialiter memorie tradere volumus, quod beati Victoris reliquias multo labore quesitas, multa difficultate impetratas ab urbe Massilia ad nos detulit et tam desiderabili et incomparabili thesauro ecclesiam nostram locupletavit.’ See Necrologium Abbatiae Sancti Victoris Parisiensis, ed. by Ursula Vones-Liebenstein, Monika Seifert, and Rainer Berndt (Münster: Aschendorff, 2012), p. 105; cf. Bonnard, Histoire de l’Abbaye Royale, p. 95 n. 1. 114 Bernard was himself indebted to Saint-Victor on account of William of Champeaux’s assistance early in Bernard’s career. Bernard later wrote a letter of introduction for Peter Lombard to visit Saint-Victor (in 1136). See Bernard of Clairvaux, Epistola 410, Sancti Bernardi Opera, 8 volumes. ed. by Leclercq, Talbot, and Rochais, viii. 391; ‘…virum venerabilem P Lombardum, rogans ut ei parvo tempore, quo moraretur in Francia causa studii…’ For the latest and persuasive treatment of the circumstances of this letter, see Matthew Doyle, Peter Lombard and His Students (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2016), pp. 26–29, 36–37. 115 Hugh’s letter is no longer extant but Bernard’s reply is (Epistle 77). Cf. Hugh Feiss, ‘Bernardus Scholasticus: The Correspondence of Bernard of Clairvaux and Hugh of St Victor on Baptism’, in Bernardus Magister, ed. by John Sommerfeldt (Kalamazoo: Cistercian Publications, 1990), pp. 360–77. 116 Already cited: Richard Cusimano’s A Translation of the Chronicle of the Abbey of Morigny, pp. 142–43. 117 John of Toulouse, Richardi canonici et prioris s.

Richard may have arrived early enough to hear Hugh’s final lessons, but he also may have arrived later in the 1140s.120 One of Richard’s fellow canons at Saint-Victor was Andrew, who had been a student of Hugh. Andrew of Saint-Victor became abbot at the Victorine Wigmore Abbey in England (1149), briefly returned to Saint-Victor (1160s), and then renewed his tenure at Wigmore (where he died in 1175).121 Both Andrew and Richard are not only heirs of Hugh but also rivals. Andrew took up Hugh’s practice of consulting Jewish rabbis and produced extensive commentaries on the Hebrew scriptures that focused on their literal or historical interpretation.122 Richard assumed the historical reading but laid his own emphasis on the allegorical and tropological senses. Richard sharply brought out their methodological divergence when he accused Andrew of excessive literal interpretation. While Andrew was absent, Richard wrote against his followers, condemning Andrew’s ‘judaizing’ historical interpretation of Isaiah’s words that Christians have taken as prophecy of the virgin birth (Ecce virgo concipiet et pariet filium…; Isaiah 7. 14–15; Matthew 1. 23). Richard did not reject historical expertise. Rather, he saw Andrew’s interpretation of ‘young woman’ for ‘virgo’ as disbelieving a prophetic witness of Scripture.123 Andrew and Richard represent valid trajectories of the Hugonic heritage. Their disagreement testifies to a living and dynamic school of thought rather than a calcified monolith. After Gilduin’s death in 1155, Achard was elected abbot and held the post until 1161, when he received the bishopric of Avranches. Sometime during Gilduin’s 118 John of Toulouse, Richardi canonici et prioris s. Victoris parisiensis vita (PL 196.ix–x); ‘natione Scotus.’ Nico den Bok observed: ‘In the 9th century, “scotus” could also refer to Ireland; yet in the 13th century it referred almost exclusively to Scotland.’ See Nico den Bok, Communicating the Most High: A Systematic Study of Person and Trinity in the Theology of Richard of St Victor (d. 1173) (Turnhout: Brepols, 1996), p. 97 n. 9. 119 John of Toulouse, Richardi canonici et prioris s. Victoris parisiensis vita (PL 196.ix–x). 120 Den Bok was open to the possibility that Richard heard Hugh (Communicating the Most High, p. 97), while Jean Grosfillier observed clear ‘intellectual filiation’ but pointed to Robert of Melun as more likely to have been Richard’s teacher ( Jean Grosfillier, ed., L’œuvre de Richard de Saint-Victor 1: De contemplatione (Benjamin maior) (Turnhout: Brepols, 2013), pp. 14–15). Dale Coulter reckoned Richard arrived around 1145, though noting that the only terminus ad quem was Gilduin’s death in 1155. See Coulter, Per Visibilia ad Invisibilia, p. 21. 121 Andrew of Saint-Victor found an early champion in Beryl Smalley but has received the least attention among Victorines. Rainer Berndt’s study of Andrew’s career, commentaries, and exegetical method is magisterial. See Beryl Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages (Oxford: Clarendon Press, [1941]), pp. 112–95; Rainer Berndt, André de Saint-Victor (1175): Exégète et Théologien (Turnhout: Brepols, 1991), pp. 46–50. 122 See Frans van Liere, ‘Andrew of St Victor, Jerome, and the Jews: Biblical Scholarship in the TwelfthCentury Renaissance’, in Scripture and Pluralism: Reading the Bible in the Religiously Plural Worlds of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, ed. by Thomas Heffernan and Thomas Burman (Leiden: Brill, 2005), pp. 59–75. 123 Berndt, André de Saint-Victor, pp. 294–97; Smalley, The Study of the Bible, pp. 110–11, pp. 115–17; Walter Cahn, ‘Architecture and Exegesis: Richard of St.-Victor’s Ezekiel Commentary and Its Illustrations’, Art Bulletin, 76.1 (1994), 53–68, 54–56.\n\ni nt ro d u ct i o n\n\nabbacy, Richard became a master at the abbey; afterward he advanced to subprior in 1159 and to prior in 1162.124 Unlike Hugh’s reluctance to dabble in politics, Richard involved Saint-Victor in the dispute between Thomas Beckett and English King Henry II. Thomas Beckett was formerly a royalist and the chancellor to the Angevin court. After his elevation to the archbishopric of Canterbury, he became a zealous champion of ecclesiastical liberties and courts. Becket won the support of Victorines and their friends. Robert of Melun, who was a former pupil of Hugh and then bishop of Hereford in England, however, appeared sympathetic to the royalists. With Abbot Ervisius, Richard wrote a letter to Robert recalling Robert’s past with Saint-Victor, chiding Robert with the reports of his hypocrisy circulating in Paris, and urging him not to take Henry’s side.125 Richard later hosted Thomas Beckett himself, who visited Saint-Victor (September 1170) and preached there in the octave of the feast of St Augustine of Hippo.126 But the greatest tumult was the disastrous abbacy of Ervisius (or Ernis), who was elected in 1162 and lasted until 1172. Ervisius would not or could not maintain the famous discipline of Saint-Victor and grossly mismanaged its properties and finances. Pope Alexander III order an investigation and wrote in correction to Ervisius. Alexander III finally brought the affair to a conclusion in 1172 b"
