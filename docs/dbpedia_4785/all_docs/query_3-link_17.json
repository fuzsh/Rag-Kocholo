        "text": "I don‚Äôt know how many of you grew up going to private schools, but I have strong memories of the process of accreditation back from when I was a student. Teachers were nervous. Visitors watched our classes. Rumors flew that the school could be shut down.\n\nNow that I‚Äôm on the adult side of the equation, accreditation is much less mysterious. Sure the process is stressful, but it‚Äôs ultimately helpful for us to reflect on and clarify our goals. I think it‚Äôs good for students to know that experts are examining how we operate; many didn‚Äôt realize that we voluntarily work with accrediting organizations (for us, FCIS, SAIS, FKC, and SACS) to demonstrate that we are meeting our mission. For this most recent visit, which concluded six days ago, we began preparing in earnest January of 2014. Our headmaster likened the experience to when visitors come to your house for dinner. Even though they won‚Äôt leave the kitchen, when you‚Äôre setting up, you‚Äôre fluffing the pillows in the bedroom and lighting candles there. That analogy totally worked for me.\n\nIn the libraries, we caught up on all sorts of tasks. We revamped our Policies and Procedures Manual. We updated the organization of the library‚Äôs electronic subscriptions webpage. We completed a thorough inventory and subsequent weeding. We expanded the Lower School library into an adjacent former computer lab. We felt pretty much ready for anything.\n\nExcept this form, which was the only information specifically requested from the libraries. (Perhaps I should clarify that this was the five-year check up visit, not the full one. However, with all of the information other departments were asked to provide, this still seems sparse.)\n\nNumber of librarians:_____ Number of clerks: _____\n\nAmount spent on books and periodicals: _____\n\nAverage monthly circulation of books: _____\n\nNumber of volumes: _____ Number of subscriptions: _____\n\nNumber of volumes per student: _____\n\nNumber of volumes added last year: _____\n\nSeating Capacity in library: _____\n\nPlease tell me that some of you are cringing a bit right now. This isn‚Äôt the 1950‚Äôs. We‚Äôre a 1-to-1 iPad school. I don‚Äôt think that my print circulation statistics or the number of seats in my library hold the key to the success of my library program. In fact, I don‚Äôt even think they shed light on that success. I dutifully filled out the form, and with it, I included the following information to the school‚Äôs accreditation chairs.\n\nThis is the type of document that makes me realize how much libraries have changed in the past few decades! Collection numbers aren‚Äôt representative of the library as much as how we are teaching students to wade through resources available to them in whatever format they find most beneficial. For example, our EBSCO database subscription contains digital access to thousands of magazines through its databases, but that isn‚Äôt reflected in our total number of periodicals. My circulation numbers are lower because we often reserve shelves of books for in-class use so students aren‚Äôt hoarding books that have a few pages on a subject when all members of a class are researching similar topics. (What about when students take pictures of pages with their iPads instead of checking out books?) Even items like library seating are less helpful when you‚Äôre working with a preschool population! üôÇ I think that our number of volumes per student is going to be lower than some schools because we‚Äôre a younger school, but we do seem to be doing pretty well overall.\n\nSo I‚Äôve been thinking about questions that are imperative for libraries today. I understand the need to keep everything easy to browse, but I think a narrative approach (one paragraph short answer) would provide more substantive answers. Fun questions like:\n\nHow do you balance digital and print resources in your collection?\n\nDescribe a time when you collaborated to teach library skills.\n\nHow do you respond when people say libraries aren‚Äôt necessary because of the Internet?\n\nThese are just some ideas I‚Äôve been throwing around half seriously. I‚Äôm sure anything that was used officially would need to be more quantitative, but we‚Äôre more than our measurements. üôÇ Think about it before your next accreditation year. What do you think needs to be part of a library accreditation in the years 2015 and beyond? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nCommon Core State Standards\n\nHappy Holidays! I don‚Äôt imagine anyone will look at this today, but perhaps sometime this week‚Ä¶I decided to take a look at Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for today‚Äôs post and see how it was being used in the independent school library.\n\nIndependent Schools and CCSS\n\nThere are several librarians like Marianna McKim, Head Librarian at Kimball Union Academy, who said, ‚ÄúWe are not officially using common core, but I am incorporating some of the ideas into our curriculum planning.‚Äù And that seems to be a common theme in the independent school milieu in general: look at what‚Äôs going on, evaluate it, and then take what is good and use just what you need. There is an abhorrence in the independence school world for being forced into a particular lock-step program. Hence the name independent!\n\nFlowcharts and Brochures and CCSS\n\nJoan Tukey, librarian at Notre Dame Academy, recently updated school brochures to reflect where Common Core skills were being used. You can see her work at the following link: Joan Tukey‚Äôs work on Common Core in her school\n\nWebinars and CCSS\n\nMargaret P. Simmons, Library Media Specialist at the June Shelton School, offered the advice to independent school librarians who are seeking to know more about Common Core that they listen to the Common Core and Text Types: What Should Students Be Reading? Webinar edWeb.net.\n\n‚ÄúI just listened to this webinar. It is so powerful! ‚Äù Simmons said in an email.\n\nLibguides and CCSS\n\nJoan Lange, librarian at Pope John Paul II High School, has done quite a bit of work on Common Core State Standards. She has created some very good libguides, complete with powerpoints and links to other materials of note and is now working on another related project. Her first libguide is general dealing with the standards in an overview way. You can find the libguide here: LibGuide: Common Core State Standards (General Resources). This libguide also includes a powerpoint by Lange‚Äôs Science Dept. Chair illustrating how Common Core relates to Next Generation Science Standards. Her second libguide is history related and deals with teaching primary sources: LibGuide: Teaching with Primary Sources (History). This libguide includes a powerpoint that she created illustrating the research process with primary sources as the starting point. It is brilliant! I highly recommend that you take a look at it.\n\nLange‚Äôs next project is creating a Common Core bookcase of literary nonfiction works, across all disciplines. This bookcase will be in her Professional Development and Audiovisual area. She is hoping that prominent display will encourage conversations with teachers on how some of these short excerpts can be incorporated in their curriculum and connect with CCSS.\n\nTechnology, Apps and CCSS\n\nAt the Berkeley Preparatory School we have started looking at CCSS in our Lower Division, where they are currently going grade by grade and looking at the Common Core skills and then comparing them to our Berkeley Identified Skills (BIS). In the library in particular, we are looking at the American Association of School Librarians Learning Standards and Common Core Crosswalk and then adding our BIS skills in a third column. Kathleen Edwards, our lower division librarian, is leading the charge on this effort. We have taken the crosswalk and eliminated all the other skills except for the library related ones, making it a little easier to use. We‚Äôve broken the files down by grade level (k-12). I will be posting those files in the AISL wiki. If you are an AISL member, please go to AISL WIKI. If you aren‚Äôt a member and are an independent school librarian, membership is only $25/year. Or if you are a librarian who would just like the files, comment below and if I receive enough requests, I will post all the documents here! (You could also link to us, as we would love to continue the conversation with you! üòé\n\nLast year, Christina Arcuri, our collection development and upper/middle librarian, went to a YALSA conference where she learned about an app called Subtext. We talked about it and how cool it was, as it could allow a whole class to annotate a book together and share those annotations with each other. And, it does much more than that:\n\nYou can create documents and convert them to an ePub format and then review them all together as a class for peer editing and review.\n\nYou can leave your own notes in the class text for students.\n\nYou have access to books and articles in Google play (free and pay), over 3 million and they do volume discounting.\n\nHowever, at the time she saw it, our school was not doing iPads and I promptly forgot it. But now, we have implemented iPads, albeit in a slow manner. Since one of the core items about CCSS is its inclusion of technology, this app seems like the perfect tool for how librarians can help faculty include instructional technology into the classroom.\n\nThis holiday break, Christina and I will be testing it out with a group of English faculty to see if we can use it even though we do not have a classroom set of iPads for upper division. We are hoping that the browser version they are beta testing is robust enough. There is not a mobile app at this time. We might be able to borrow the middle division iPad classroom set in a pinch! Or request a set of iPads for upper next year. If you are considering CCSS, I recommend that you check out Subtext, especially as they are exploring a browser version. Go to web.subtext.com if you want to try it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is just a taste of what is going on in the independent school library with CCSSs. Please follow the blog and comment if you want to be a part of the conversation. Let us know what you are doing and what you have found to be successful. If you have found a great app, please share it.\n\nIf you want to get started, here are some articles I found useful. Paige‚Äôs article had some great links. And I hope everyone has a wonderful and relaxing holiday break!\n\nCravey, Nancy. ‚ÄúFinding Inspiration in the Common Core.‚Äù Knowledge Quest. 42.1 2013 18-22 Advanced Placement Source. http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/90230622/finding-inspiration-common-core\n\nJaeger, Paige. ‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Live in a Multiple-Choice World: Inquiry and the Common Core.‚Äù Library Media Connection.
