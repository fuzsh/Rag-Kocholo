        "text": "This course is the first course and a partial fulfillment of the AP Capstone Program offered by the College Board and is a prerequisite for the AP Capstone Research course. The AP Seminar course is an inquiry-based course that aims to engage students in cross-curricular conversations that explore real-world topics and issues from multiple perspectives. Students are empowered to collect and analyze information with accuracy and precision in order to craft and communicate evidence-based arguments.\n\nThis AP course is designed to foster inquiry, scientific problem solving, global awareness, and independent thinking. The interdisciplinary units connect scientific study with real-world issues. Students will read, analyze and discuss research articles in the area of interest. Exploring different points of view and making connections across other disciplines is a fundamental component of the AP Seminar program.\n\nWhat is AP Capstone?\n\nAP Capstone is an innovative diploma program that provides students with an opportunity to engage in rigorous scholarly practice of the core academic skills necessary for successful college completion. The program is built on the foundation of two courses — AP Seminar and AP Research — and is designed to complement and enhance the in depth, discipline-specific study provided through AP courses. It cultivates curious, independent, and collaborative scholars and prepares them to make logical, evidence-based decisions.\n\nWhat kind of input and support has AP Capstone received from the higher education community?\n\nCollege faculty members and admissions staff from more than 50 colleges/universities (including from Stanford, Columbia, Duke and Berkeley) have been a vital part of the design and development of the AP Capstone program. Approximately 75 colleges and universities have publically endorsed the AP Capstone diploma program and many are currently in the process of reviewing the curriculum and assessment structure in order to consider credit and placement policies."
