        "text": "Faculty & Staff\n\nRobin Adams graduated from Sonoma State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. She's spent several years teaching CS to a wide range of students, from elementary schools to college. Robin loves working with children, and spent a few years working in childcare at the YMCA and on-site at several schools across Marin. She loves underground music, especially hip hop, and has an extensive collection of video games.\n\nRobin Adams — Math, Science\n\nUmyeena went to Southern Methodist University and received a degree in Applied Mathematics. She went on to receive her Masters in Organic Chemistry at the University of San Francisco. Before teaching at Headlands Prep, she worked in industry as a medicinal chemist and worked at UCSF’s Bixby center as a patient stakeholder for improving healthcare protocols in the emergency room. However, she has always had a love for teaching and is happy to be back helping others learn about chemistry and math! In her free time, she enjoys yoga, hiking, and baking!\n\nUmyeena Bashir — Math, Science\n\nTim has been teaching at Headlands since 2019, and currently serves as the Math Department Head, bringing over a decade of educational expertise. Dedicated to the one-to-one learning approach, he tailors lessons to students' unique needs, fostering a love for learning in the various subjects he teaches, including Science, Social Science, and History. A devoted lifelong learner, he finds inspiration in reading and writing and open-source software. In his downtime, Tim enjoys exploring diverse interests such as hiking, weightlifting, computing projects, and playing with/getting yelled at by his cat, Calvin.\n\nTim Bearden — Math Department Chair, Math, Science, History, Social Sciences\n\nNat holds an MA in Philosophy from San Francisco State University. His research primarily focused on the intersection of philosophy of science and phenomenology. Prior to this, he received his BA in Philosophy and Linguistics, also from San Francisco State. He discovered his love for teaching while working as a Graduate Teaching Associate and Instructional Student Assistant during grad school. Outside the classroom you can usually find him in and around the water, either sailing, surfing, swimming, walking his two miniature dachshunds or taking the occasional nap on the beach.\n\nNat Burke — English, History, Social Science\n\nBorn and raised in a suburban town of Los Angeles, Nicole had influential high school teachers who sparked a joy within her for history and writing. This led Nicole to earn a B.A. in History with a minor in Journalism from San Francisco State University in 2019. Nicole has a deep love for travel – she has lived in Bali, Indonesia, and has backpacked through Europe and Iceland. Throughout college and her travels, Nicole grew passionate about writing, education, diversity, and all things multicultural. In her free time, Nicole enjoys yoga, boxing, and cooking.\n\nNicole Cadavona — History Department Chair, English, History, Math\n\nLifelong passions for language, culture, and literature along with a natural affinity for teaching led Laurel to pursue her master's degree in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, and, once earned in 2012, propelled her on an exciting journey to rural Thailand, where she taught, developed curriculum, trained teachers, and co-wrote a textbook. In 2015, she returned to the states and spent 6+ years teaching and developing curriculum as a full-time faculty member at the University of Southern California. Laurel is quick to point out that her academic success is in no way reflective of her performance in grade school. Challenges in her environment took away her confidence and led Laurel to believe that she didn't like teachers or school; but to quote Louise Penny, one of her favorite modern authors, \"things are strongest where they are broken,\" and Laurel is convinced that her struggles as a student are now a precious resource to her skills as an educator. In her free time, Laurel enjoys portraiture, reading, writing, singing, playing guitar, yoga, mindfulness meditation, learning languages, cooking, dancing, hiking, backpacking, and doing absolutely anything with her poodle-mix, Daisy. She has traveled to more than 15 countries and has spent more than one month in Japan, Italy, Korea (6 months), and Thailand (2.5 years).\n\nLaurel Costill — English, History, Math\n\nRecovering from an inability to sit still and be quiet in class, Jim managed to enter the University of Florida’s Invitational Honors Program and eventually graduate with a BA. He went on to do lab tech work for USDA and then earned a Primary Certification from the AMI, Montessori’s international organization.

While obtaining her MA, Susie tutored in the Writing Center and was a Teacher's Assistant in a Basic Composition class for first year students. She taught a college level English course for one year before finding her true calling of working one-to-one with students. This realization led her to become an instructor at Lindamood-Bell for four years where she taught children with various learning differences and enabled them to thrive and feel successful in an academic environment. Susie loves working with students at Headlands and truly believes that literature can be transformative. In her free time, Susie enjoys reading, socializing with friends, and traveling.\n\nSusie Haas — English\n\nSebastián was born and raised in Santiago, Chile, but lived in the Bay Area as a child during the early '90s.

Allie began her professional career at Autistry Studios, a San Rafael-based makerspace and academic day program for teens and adults on the autism spectrum, where she held several roles over eight years, including Program Director of Education. Autistry fostered Allie's love of working with students with complex cognitive profiles and convinced her of the power of individualized approaches to learning. After leaving Autistry, Allie taught Math, Biology, Anatomy & Physiology, and Psychology at Headlands, where she was taken in by the school's community and commitment to student growth. During the 2021-22 school year, Allie worked as the STEAM Integration Specialist at San Domenico School in San Anselmo, where she taught computer science and tinkering, helped run and develop the school's makerspace, and assisted teachers in grades K-12 in bringing making and project-based learning to their classes.

Both his passion for teaching and art started at UCSB, where he was introduced to the College of Creative Studies, a subdivision of the college where he took painting courses and developed his senior thesis. It was through this program that he gained attention from the school and was featured in the school newspaper for helping others tap into their creativity. Oliver maintains homeostasis in his life by painting and researching scientific articles. He lives by the quote “art and sciences are branches of the same tree” by Albert Einstein. Oliver started tutoring students in math, science, and English while attending college and continued tutoring students in group homes after he graduated. To keep spreading his love for art, he teaches plein-air painting courses at a summer camp in the East Bay. Oliver has also written an autobiography as well as a book of short stories.
