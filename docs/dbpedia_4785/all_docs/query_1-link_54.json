        "meta_description": "Located in Los Angeles, CA, Berkeley Hall School is a private, coeducational school for students in preschool through grade 8. Rigorous academics in a supportive atmosphere and grounded character development allow students to become fearless scholars and conscientious citizens - gain a love of learning, leadership with social responsibility, creativity with moral integrity, and self-esteem with compassion for others and the environment.",

        "text": "Berkeley Hall has been promoting a growth mindset for over a century. What does that mean? It means that every opportunity is taken at Berkeley Hall to teach students that their ability to learn is not a static nor a fixed thing. That learning can change and improve with persistent effort over time. Therefore, failure is temporary and is something that can be learned from – and is not a permanent condition that defines a student, but rather an opportunity for that student to expend more effort and to advocate for him or herself to learn something new.\n\nWe have a rigorous academic program, so students are challenged at Berkeley Hall, but they are also made to feel comfortable enough to take intellectual risks and are taught to persist in the face of challenge [not to give up and say, “oh, I guess I’m not a math person.”) (We always interject the word “yet.” – A child says, “I’m not good at fractions.” We say, “yet!”]. Developing a growth mindset –along with a helping of good old-fashioned grit –is a cornerstone of a Berkeley Hall education.\n\nWhen I first came to visit the campus and met the students and saw the classrooms, I was impressed with the presence of this growth mindset – students seemed simultaneously intellectually active and yet comfortable making mistakes and going through the learning process. In all my years as an educator, I’d never seen this occur in such an all-encompassing way within one school; I’d seen active thinking and learning, but with a certain level of stress over possible failure, and I’d been in schools with very little stress, but not a lot of active learning on the parts of students. I’d rarely seen active learning with little stress throughout a whole school until I came to Berkeley Hall."
