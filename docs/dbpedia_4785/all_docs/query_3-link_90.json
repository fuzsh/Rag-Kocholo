        "text": "Top Boarding Schools in the U.S.\n\n1. Phillips Exeter Academy\n\nMore commonly known as Exeter, this New Hampshire school has been the unofficial feeder for Harvard for decades, serving boys and girls in grades 9-12 (post-graduate year available).\n\nStudents choose from more than 450 courses in 19 subject areas in true Exeter style: The Harkness method, the plan that calls for dialogue-based learning. The one-of-a-kind math curriculum focuses on problem sets and seminar-based learning, tossing traditional textbooks aside in favor of student-owned learning processes. More than 80% of the faculty are advanced degree-holders.\n\nSince 2007, Exeter has implemented a financial aid initiative that provides a free education to any student whose family income is $75,000 or less, making a truly wealthy, world-class education available to anybody who qualifies for the rigorous course of study.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 80%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $46,905\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 46%\n\nNotable alumni: Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook), Dan Brown (author), Christopher Kimball (Cook’s Illustrated and America’s Test Kitchen)\n\n2. Phillips Academy (Andover)\n\nLocated in Andover, Massachusetts, Phillips Academy was founded in 1778,and is the oldest incorporated boarding school in the United States. Andover (as it is universally known) has the historic significance of being an original feeder school for Yale. It was also the first private secondary school to establish and implement a need-blind admission policy. Andover is able to meet 100% of a family’s demonstrated financial need by way of grants.\n\nLike its arch-rival Exeter, Andover’s faculty is composed of 80% advanced degree-holders. The school, which also uses the Harkness method and is equally rich in tradition, offers a wide array of music classes–many students take private lessons through the prep school at nearby New England Conservatory. Beyond academics, all Andover students participate in a work-duty program and are assigned to different jobs throughout the year.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 75%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $48,850\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 47%\n\nNotable alumni: George W. Bush, Humphrey Bogart, Jack Lemmon, Julia Alvarez\n\n3. The Putney School\n\nFounded in 1935, the Putney School in Vermont offers a rigorous yet progressive, hands-on education to students in grades 9-12. Students here are encouraged to pursue their personal academic interests, as well as to “present their thinking in coherent and compelling ways.”\n\nThis approach is certainly working. Graduates gain entrance to the very best schools in the country; they attend Ivies like Yale, Dartmouth, Columbia, and Cornell, as well as schools like Oberlin, Sarah Lawrence, and Boston College.\n\nIn addition to academics, students participate in an arts-based program two nights a week and must satisfy six jobs during their stay–lunch, dinner, barn crew, dish crew, substitute, and land-use activities–which helps instill in them a different kind of work ethic not generally found in the classroom.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 79%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $50,800\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 43%\n\nNotable alumni: Reid Hoffman (co-founder of LinkedIn), Nell Newman (founder of Newman’s Own), Felicity Huffman (actress)\n\n4. Church Farm School\n\nThe Church Farm School, located in Exton, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1918, as a college preparatory, independent, boarding school for boys in grades 7-12. Loyal to its name and its Episcopal heritage, the school requires attendance at weekly chapel services and meetings.\n\nStudents at CFS are required to take part in the co-curricular C.O.R.E. (Challenge Of Required Experience) program, which provides opportunities for community service, outdoor experiences, leadership training, and exposure to cultural arts. Graduates often attend schools such as Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Emory, MIT, Princeton, Rice, Notre Dame, and Penn.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 90%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $34,300\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 90%\n\nNotable alumni: Talmadge O’Neill (Silicon Valley entrepreneur), Chris Raab (actor), Michael Eric (NBA)\n\nChurch Farm is also featured amongst “The 30 Best Christian Boarding Schools.”\n\n5. Episcopal High School\n\nLocated just seven miles from the White House in Alexandria, Virginia, Episcopal High School is a private, coeducational school that boards 100% of its students, which contributes to a thriving campus community. As its name suggests, the school has a religious affiliation and all students are required to attend chapel three times a week.\n\nProximity to the nation’s capital has resulted in the development of the school’s signature Washington Program, which offers four concentrations: Public Policy, Sustainability, Cultural Awareness, and Entrepreneurship. Sophomores dabble in each concentration, select one the following year, and engage in a year-long project and externship during their final year.\n\nMore than 85% of faculty hold advanced degrees and teach over 140 courses. In recent years, Episcopal students matriculate in high numbers at William and Mary, Duke, Wake Forest, Washington & Lee, UVA, UNC-Chapel Hill, and Sewanee.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 100%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $49,700\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 32%\n\nNotable alumni: Senator John McCain, Bryson Spinner (NFL)\n\n6. St. Paul’s School\n\nFounded in 1856 in Concord, New Hampshire, St. Paul’s School is an all-boarding school for students in grades 9-12. The school offers a post-graduate year. Not only do all of the students live on campus, but all of the faculty do, too, which works to promote a close, spirited campus community. The community also begins four days of the week with chapel services. In order to ease the transition to campus life, each new student is assigned a “big brother” or “big sister.”\n\nClasses are rigorous and implement the Harkness method; colleges with the highest matriculation of St. Paul’s alumni include Georgetown, Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Harvard. Rather than having physical education classes, St. Paul’s requires all its students to play sports.\n\nIn order to make a St. Paul’s education more affordable, students from household incomes of $80,000 or less are considered full financial need.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 100%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $52,200\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 33% (need-based grants)\n\nNotable alumni: Secretary of State John Kerry, John Jacob Astor IV, Judd Nelson (actor)\n\n7. Asheville School\n\nIn the mountain city of Asheville, North Carolina, lies the Asheville School, a private coeducational boarding school founded in 1900 for students in grades 9-12. Students here learn to challenge themselves academically and personally. The natural setting of the area invites mountaineering: all first-year student go on a three-day wilderness camping trip complete with a high-ropes course. They also take a series of seminars designed to orient them to Asheville School.\n\nAcademics mirror the rigor of the outdoor adventure through the four-year sequence of the Integrated Humanities program. Seniors must also complete a Senior Demonstration that requires them to write a series of papers on a chosen topic and defend the topic to a faculty panel. Seniors also give “Chapel Talks” in which they make oral presentations on personal and significant ideas or experiences in front of the entire campus community.\n\nThe community service requirement–one that is common among boarding schools–differs at Asheville in that students complete 40 hours of service for one organization and submit an essay about that experience to the headmaster.\n\nIn addition to Ivies, students attend Bates, Boston College, Davidson, Furman, University of Richmond, and West Point.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 80%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $47,375\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 30%\n\nNotable alumni: Dr. D.

The school also offers a post-graduate year. SSM provides a unique blend of tradition and innovation to their students.\n\nThe school maintains its traditional Episcopalian identity and offers weekly chapel services, classes in religion, and the saying of grace before lunch.

Committed to its Episcopalian identity, St. Andrew’s is an all-boarding, coed private school for students in grades 9-12. Along with the all-boarding requirement, family-style meals during the week (where students take turns waiting tables) help ensure a close-knit community on campus. St. Andrew’s requires chores of students (which are usually in the student’s dorm and rotate regularly).\n\nAcademics are rigorous and graduates attend Ivy League schools and other top-tiers like NYU and Vanderbilt. Seniors take spring tutorials which are reading and writing intensive, in which three students meet in a course specifically designed by faculty members across a range of disciplines in the spirit of the Oxford tutorial method, and then defend an original thesis to the English Department.\n\nTrue to its heritage, St. Andrew’s offers a Pipes & Drums ensemble that gives students the opportunity to learn and perform the bagpipes or learn field drumming, and requires attendance at chapels and Sunday service. Lastly, the school can meet 100% of demonstrated financial need for students.\n\nPercentage of students who board: 100%\n\nTuition, room, and board: $53,500\n\nPercentage of students who receive some form of financial aid: 47%\n\nNotable alumni: Erin Burnett (CNN journalist), Loudon Wainright, Jr. (Life magazine columnist), Eric Boateng (basketball player)\n\nSt. Andrew is also featured amongst “The 30 Best Christian Boarding Schools.”\n\n10. The Thacher School\n\nFounded in 1889, the Thacher School in Ojai, California, is the oldest coed boarding school in the state. Nearly 90% of students live on campus, which naturally contributes to a strong campus community along with Formal Dinners four nights a week and seven-day-long camping trips each semester.\n\nFreshmen not only have a single room during their first year at Thacher, they also learn to appreciate the value of good old-fashioned hard work through the mandatory Horse Program, where they learn all the basics of horsemanship (both caretaking and riding). Through this program, students develop a higher sense of self-esteem, along with problem-solving skills and responsibility. Students also take at least one overnight horse-packing trip during the year.\n\nLife within the classroom walls encourages the same development of responsibility and critical thinking, with seniors developing, researching, and presenting their senior thesis in Senior Exhibitions.

Of particular note is the approach of cultivating personal interests and a sense of community.\n\nThe inscription on the Deerfield Academy seal reads: “Be Worthy of Your Heritage.” At Deerfield, it is understood that “heritage” means more than just the legacy of those who came before. It is an all-encompassing identity and set of core values that the community lives by. Respecting and valuing this heritage is the reason for traditions like sit-down meals and the singing of the Evensong, but it is also the reason the Academy reestablished coeducation in 1989 and continues to develop a curriculum and campus to meet the educational demands of the 21st century.\n\nDeerfield also boasts a thriving alumni network of 12,000-plus.
