        "text": "Poets&Quants Top Business Schools\n\n#14\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management\n\nMBA Program Stats\n\nAnnual Tuition: $86,300\n\nFull-Time Enrollment: 408\n\nAverage GPA: 3.59\n\nMedian GMAT: 730\n\nInternational: 40%\n\nMinority: 32%\n\nFemale: 46%\n\nMale: 54%\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nMIT Sloan consistently ranks as one of the top MBA programs in the world. Through intellectual rigor and experiential learning, Sloan’s full-time, two-year MBA program develops leaders who make a difference in the world. Sloan first offered their MBA in 1995, and their Latin motto, “mens et manus,” translates to “mind and hand.” MIT’s founders were promoting that education, above all, was for practical application and highlighting experiential learning as a centerpiece of the MBA experience.\n\nBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the school has birthed breakthrough technologies ranging from GPS and genome sequencing to data encryption and multiplayer video games – not to mention ventures like Campbell’s Soup, EdX, Hewlett Packard, and Roomba Vacuums.\n\n“The MIT Sloan student community is diverse not only in terms of nationality, race, and ethnicity, but also in terms of intellectual perspective and life experience. The student culture is highly collaborative and is perhaps best characterized in its slogan, “Sloanies helping Sloanies.” This spirit of collaboration comes through in a similarly named conversational podcast, Sloanies Talking Sloanies, in which alumni and faculty discuss their MIT Sloan experience and how it influences what they are doing today.”\n\nAcademics And Programs\n\nSloan welcomes a large class of around 400 students on average annually, and in the MBA world, large typically equals diverse.\n\nAfter their first-semester core courses, students have three semesters to create a program that fits their interests. In total, they’ll complete 144 units of electives. Sloan has 15-20 annual Action Learning Labs, where students work on projects collaboratively with organizations ranging from startups in an emerging market to well-established corporations focusing on areas such as Analytics, Operations, Strategy, Finance, or Marketing.\n\nAction Learning Labs aren’t the only unique element to the Sloan MBA. The program also includes the Sloan Intensive Period (SIP). Held in October and March, SIP represents a hard stop to MBA courses. For a week, students take micro courses to hone skills and engage in reflection in areas ranging from ethics to creativity.\n\nIn January, the second semester launches with an Independent Activities Period (IAP). The month-long IAP period is allocated for students to work on projects, complete internships, or even engage in school-related travel. While the IAP eases students back in after the holidays, it also provides them with the time and freedom to pursue the passions that will deliver the highest return. Indeed, Sloan’s flexible structure is cited by students as one of the school’s biggest assets.\n\nMIT Sloan offers tracks specifically for MBA students and Certificates open to all MIT graduate students to give students the opportunity to dive deep into what interests them. Track options include the Entrepreneurship & Innovation Track, Enterprise Management Track, and the Finance Track. Certificate options include the Business Analytics Certificate, the Healthcare Systems Certificate and the Sustainability Certificate. Completing an internship is a key component of the experience, creating an opportunity to apply new knowledge with real experience.\n\nOutside of the classroom, Sloan students have the opportunity to engage in over 80 clubs and conferences such as the world’s largest student-run conference, the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, and competitions like the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition which enables students across campus to launch a startup.\n\nRankings Data For MIT Sloan\n\nMIT Sloan MBA Rankings\n\nRanking Poets&Quants 2023-2024 14 2022-2023 6 2021-2022 6 2020-2021 6 2019-2020 6\n\nGetting Into This School\n\nMIT Sloan School Of Management Essay Questions And Strategic Guidance, 2023-2024\n\nMIT Sloan seeks individuals with confidence but not arrogance.\n\nMIT Sloan School Of Management Essay Tips And Examples\n\nWriting cover letters will undoubtedly be a large part of students’ career development efforts at Sloan, after all, so why not start now?\n\nHow To Get Accepted To MIT Sloan MBA\n\nMIT Sloan Assistant Dean Dawna Levenson shares everything applicants to the M7 school should know before applying\n\nMBA Program Consideration Set\n\nIf you believe you’re a close match to this school–based on your scores, age and work experience, you could look at these other competitive full-time MBA programs as well.

These complex challenges require integrated solutions. With MIT’s strong reputation for innovation and MIT Sloan’s impressive course offerings, MIT Sloan was a perfect fit. While some MBA programs operate in silos within the larger university, that is certainly not the case at MIT Sloan. Beyond the option to take courses outside of Sloan at MIT, Harvard, and other schools in the area, Sloanies can also take integrated courses where students of design, business, and engineering can come together to leverage each other’s strengths. Within Sloan itself, I was impressed by the breadth of opportunities to pursue technology product management. Sloan offers a Digital Product Management Certificate, a Digital Product Management Lab and a Product Management Club with a robust campus membership. While the Digital Product Management Certificate is relatively new, Sloan has long been a strong pipeline for many technology and e-commerce companies who recruit product managers on campus every year.” Katie Hango (‘24)\n\n“There are only a few MBA programs that support Entrepreneurship in a creative way in the USA. MIT’s Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship offers the key MBA programming that led me to choose this business school. I’m an entrepreneur at heart. I’m very interested in Sloan entrepreneurial culture, which marries business, technology, and disruptive ideas. Choosing Sloan was important to me because I have a vision to build ‘Salons of the Future’ and MIT Sloan will give me the opportunity to bring my idea to fruition.” Robin Butler (‘24)\n\n“MIT Sloan’s focus on building data-driven leaders stood out to me as a unique offering. From classes that help develop quantitative skills to a close association with MIT’s other engineering programs, the school equips students to face the digitization wave head on. I was looking for a program that acknowledges the role technology plays in every job function and industry today and gives you the skills and network needed to succeed in the evolving landscape. At MIT Sloan, I have found this.” Misha Nathani (‘24)\n\n“The MIT Sloan MBA lies on the perfect intersection between finance, technology & entrepreneurship. Sloan’s finance courses, taught by distinguished faculty and Nobel Laureates, coupled with my pre-MBA experience in finance at the central bank, will sharpen my financial skills and prepare me to transition into an investment management role within the Indonesia government. Moreover, MIT is at the forefront of technology, where scientific breakthroughs and thought leadership are plentiful. In this digital age, technology & innovative management drives transformation in both the private and public sector. I’m keen to learn about cutting-edge innovations at MIT and apply it in Indonesia’s tech landscape to develop future unicorns.\n\nFurthermore, the MIT MBA prides itself in developing future entrepreneurs.
