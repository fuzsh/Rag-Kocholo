        "text": "This paper critically assesses the use of the name 'Pseudo-Archytas' to refer to two aspects of the reception of Archytas of Tarentum in antiquity: the 'author-inflection' and the 'authority-inflection'. In order to make progress on our understanding of authority and authorship within the Pythagorean tradition, it attempts to reconstruct Porphyry's views on the importance of Archytas as guarantor of Pythagorean authenticity in the former's lost work On the History of the Philosophers by considering a fragment preserved in Arabic by Ibn Abī Uṣaybi‘a. The article finally argues that a range of problems attend our use of the term 'pseudo-Archytas', which is not fit for purpose when considering the evidence regarding authorship and authority in the Pythagorean tradition. It recommends a more critical approach to the notion of authenticity within the Pythagorean tradition and suggests a new term, 'Archytism', as a more useful point of reference.\n\nIn the Cohortatio ad Graecos, a work included in Justin Martyr's corpus and recently attributed to the Monarchian Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (cf. C. Riedweg, B. Pouderon), there is a passage dedicated to Pythagoras (cf. 19). Such a reference is part of a string of quotations from pagan authors on the subject of the so-called monotheism. Having already proved the antiquity and excellence of Moses, the first prophet (9-12), and presented the story of the Septuagint translation (13), Ps.-Justin meks further remarks about Greeks having become acquainted with the writings of Moses in Egypt and therefore expressing 'monotheistic' views (14). Other authorities quoted are Orpheus (15), Sibyl (16), Homer (17), Sophocles (18), and Plato (20), after which the work progresses as a more detailed attempt to show the dependance of Plato and Homer on the Hebrew Scriptures. In this paper, I aim to explore the Cohortatio account on Pythagoras in its connection with the other authorities quoted in the text, in order to stress the cultural work carried out by Ps.-Justin/Marcellus about the Greek Philosopher and the ideological elements ascribed to him in the treatise. In keeping with his general intention of bringing forward Greek expressions of monotheism, the subject Ps.-Justin announces for Pythagoras is 'monas' (19,1,5), drawing a sort of parallel with the religion of Orpheus (Orpheus is explicitly said to have visited Egypt). The conclusion one can reach is that the monotheism attributed to Pythagoras is a cultural construct, strictly connected with Orpheus, and that the author of Cohortatio aims to defend the so-called Monarchianism, around the period of Arian crisis. My main objective is to emphasize how the (re-)invention of a Pythagorean monotheism and/or religion constitutes a Christian apologetic discourse strictly linked with the invention of an Orphic monotheism, two cultural constructs carried out in the period of the Nicaea Council (325 CE), a seminal phase in the formation of Christian monotheism.\n\nhttp://periodicos.unb.br/index.php/archai/article/view/26566/23229 Our purpose on the present occasion is to evaluate some ideas the biographers of late antiquity held about the origins of European thought. Speaking about this period we are no longer dealing with the question of transferring of the archaic practices: these practices are indeed long dead. What we encounter can be better defined as the import of ideas. Equally important is a study of the changing attitudes of our authors: rather than passive witnesses, they became active participants of this import. The process is truly fascinatingand wehope that the following examples, mostly from Hippolytus, will elucidate this. The best, almosta paradigmatic example is Pythagoras, who in late antiquity had many faces. His biography is an interesting instance of general change of attitude to ancient wisdom, typical for the source utilized by Hippolytus. Looking at a number of peculiar features of Hippolytus’ report which, we hope, will help us to see why the image of Pythagoras and his philosophy, formed by Hippolytus, is somewhat untypical for the period. We will see that Hippolytus’ biographic report, however garbled, shows no signs of so-called ‘Neopythagorean’ biographic development. Admittedly, the later authors frequently combine their sources to make them suitable to their needs, polemical or apologetic. Do we still have a reason to believe that these stories, however doubtful from the historical point of view, may contain the germs of truth?"
