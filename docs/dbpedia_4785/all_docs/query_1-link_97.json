        "text": "Welcome to the Salesian College Preparatory website! Thanks for taking the time to explore this vibrant Catholic community that for over 50 years has educated the young in the tradition of our patron, St. John Bosco. Guided by the Salesian educational philosophy rooted in reason, religion, and loving kindness, the approach to our students is to educate from the heart. We have successfully prepared thousands of students for college admission over those fifty years based on a rigorous academic curriculum, and a dynamic co-curricular program that has encouraged young people to pursue their passions and fully embrace community involvement through public service.\n\nOur challenging college preparatory curriculum is designed to not only meet but exceed the University of California and California State University admission standards. Dedicated Guidance counselors work patiently with each student to design a course of studies based on personal interests, talents, and career and college goals. Our Laptop program and emphasis on STEM teaching and learning will equip students with the digital tools necessary for a 21st century world. A highly qualified and distinguished faculty imparts their knowledge, experience, skills, and core values that will make Salesian students the leaders of tomorrow and productive global citizens of the world.\n\nSalesianâ€™s co-curricular program is designed to further learning outside of the classroom through a variety of clubs and activities organized to respond to the needs of a diverse student body. Students are encouraged to become actively involved in cultural clubs, visual and performing arts or service oriented organizations that enable them to meet new friends, cultivate life-long relationships, and grow in confidence. Students are challenged physically and mentally via a competitive athletic program with several nationally ranked teams. Additionally, the Salesian Leadership and Ministry program invites students of all religious faiths to participate in liturgies, retreats and service opportunities which further engage young people in their faith development. These varied experiences help our students develop an appreciation for others, motivate teamwork and collaboration, heighten spirituality, refine leadership skills, and a good sportsmanship.\n\nI encourage you to stop by and tour our expansive 21 acre campus and experience the warmth and inviting atmosphere of our school community. Meet our impressive faculty, spend a day with our awesome students, and catch the Salesian spirit and see for yourself what Academics, Faith and Family are really about! Join the more than 5,000 Salesian alumni across the nation and around the world that have all been shaped by this unique Salesian experience. Stay connected to us through Facebook and Instagram, and sign up for the monthly\n\n-newsletter to stay informed about Salesian.\n\nI look forward to meeting you soon!"
