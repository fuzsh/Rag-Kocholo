        "text": "ASU ranked No. 1 in innovation for 9th straight year\n\nOriginally published on ASU News.\n\nUS News & World Report accolade joins university’s series of top rankings in areas that matter\n\nFor the ninth year in a row, Arizona State University is No. 1 in innovation among American universities, ahead of Stanford, MIT and Caltech, in the newly released annual “Best Colleges” 2024 rankings by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe continued recognition underscores ASU’s commitment to being a New American University — an enterprise dedicated to the simultaneous pursuit of excellence, broad access to quality education, and meaningful societal impact — and joins a series of top rankings that ASU has earned in high-impact areas.\n\nIn the past three years, ASU has been named:\n\nNo. 1 in global impact, by Times Higher Education (2020–23), ahead of MIT and Penn State.\n\nNo. 1 in research expenditures for geological and earth sciences, anthropology, and transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and other sciences, by the National Science Foundation (2021), ahead of such universities as Caltech, Harvard and Johns Hopkins, respectively.\n\nNo. 1 in engineering technology enrollment, by the American Society for Engineering Education (2021), ahead of Texas A&M, the Rochester Institute of Technology and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.\n\nNo. 1 journalism school in top overall awards for news, by the Broadcast Education Association (2023), ahead of Syracuse, the University of Florida and the University of Southern California.\n\nNo. 1 in visual and performing arts doctorates, by the National Science Foundation (2022), ahead of UCLA, Harvard and Yale.\n\nNo. 1 public university in the U.S. chosen by international students, by the Institute of International Education (2022), ahead of UCLA, UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nNo. 1 in homeland security and emergency management, by U.S. News & World Report (2023), ahead of George Washington University, Columbia University and the University of Southern California.\n\nNo. 1 business online bachelor’s programs, by U.S. News & World Report (2023), ahead of Penn State University-World Campus and the University of Arizona.\n\n“The world is changing faster than ever, and outmoded approaches are not enough to counter the increasingly complex problems facing our planet,” said Arizona State University President Michael M. Crow. “ASU’s innovation mindset attracts creative and dynamic minds who tackle society’s biggest challenges — from ending health disparities to ensuring a habitable planet to advancing our national security — in ways both inventive and effective.\n\n“Bolstered by collaboration across disciplines and sectors, we are perpetually inspired to demonstrate how optimism and ingenuity can yield better outcomes for all.”\n\nASU has ranked No. 1, ahead of MIT and Stanford, every year since the “most innovative” category was created by U.S. News & World Report magazine. Institutions are nominated by college presidents, provosts and admissions deans across the country, and schools are chosen based on who is making the most innovative improvements in curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology and facilities.\n\nIn the past year, ASU has announced several initiatives that will have a huge impact on the local and global stage:\n\nThe university will launch the ASU School of Medicine and Advanced Medical Engineering, which will integrate clinical medicine, biomedical science and engineering. The new school highlights a comprehensive new effort to help improve health outcomes across Arizona, which ranks near or in the bottom quartile of many health system performance indicators.\n\nIn partnership with Applied Materials Inc., ASU will build a $270 million research, development and prototyping facility — the Materials-to-Fab Center — in the university’s MacroTechnology Works building at ASU Research Park. This effort will help advance Arizona’s burgeoning semiconductor industry, key to the nation’s security.\n\nASU won $90.8 million — the largest National Science Foundation research award in the university’s history — to advance groundbreaking research in X-ray science by building the world’s first compact X-ray free electron laser, or CXFEL, on the Tempe campus. This one-of-a-kind, room-sized X-ray laser instrument will fill a critical need for researchers to explore the intricacies of complex matter at atomic length and ultrafast time.\n\nThe university was chosen to lead the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative to provide immediate, actionable and evidence-based solutions to ensure that Arizona will have a secure future water supply. The governor has asked ASU to work with industrial, municipal, agricultural, tribal and international partners to rapidly accelerate and deploy new approaches and technology for water conservation, augmentation, desalination, efficiency, infrastructure and reuse.\n\nASU has widened access to higher education through Study Hall, a partnership with YouTube and Crash Course in which learners can now earn college credit through courses that begin on YouTube. The first four courses, which launched in March, create a flexible new pathway to higher education that provides up to 12 transferable college credits.\n\nLatest rankings\n\nIn the new U.S. News & World Report rankings, the university placed in the top 20 in other notable categories, including tied for No. 13 among U.S. universities in undergraduate teaching; tied No. 16 for senior capstone programs; and tied for No. 16 for first-year experiences.\n\nASU also had distinguished rankings among several of its undergraduate degrees and programs including:\n\nBusiness\n\nFor undergraduate rankings, the W. P. Carey School of Business was tied for No. 29 in the country, ahead of Brigham Young University, Babson College and the University of Rochester. The school also had 10 undergraduate disciplines or departments ranked in the top 30, including: No. 2 for supply chain management and logistics; No. 9 for analytics and No. 9 for business management information systems.\n\nEngineering\n\nThe Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering tied for No. 34 overall and placed in the top 20 for public engineering schools, ahead of the University of Florida, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of California, Irvine. Four undergraduate programs ranked in the top 20 for their categories: civil engineering (No. 16), cybersecurity — computer science (No. 16, tied), computer engineering (No. 16, tied) and electrical engineering (No. 17, tied).\n\nEducation\n\nThe Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College ranked in the top 20 for two undergraduate programs: elementary teacher education and secondary teacher education, which both ranked No. 13.\n\nFind the full rankings on the U.S. News & World Report website.\n\nExcellence in Education\n\nWe are shining a spotlight on two remarkable individuals who have been recognized for their outstanding contributions to ASU Prep. Allow us to introduce Eric Roth, math marvel and esteemed 2023 Teacher of the Year, and Allison Voltaire, exemplary elementary principal and 2023 Staff Member of the Year. They both embody the spirit of excellence, innovation, and unwavering commitment to student success that defines ASU Prep.\n\nMeet Teacher of the Year: Eric Roth\n\nIn the realm of education, there are teachers who leave an indelible mark on their students and inspire them to reach for the stars. Eric Roth, a middle school math teacher at ASU Prep Digital, is one such educator. Since joining the ASU Prep team in the fall of 2020, Mr. Roth has made a profound impact on his students and the school community, earning him the well-deserved title of Teacher of the Year.\n\nMr. Roth explains what led him to a career in teaching math. “My parents and grandparents always told me if I set my mind to it, I could accomplish anything. I also had several professors during my undergraduate program that supported me. What better way to give back then do the same for others.” Prior to joining ASU Prep Digital, Mr. Roth dedicated more than a decade to teaching math at Coconino High School in Flagstaff, Arizona. During these years, he also demonstrated impressive versatility and commitment by working as a special education teacher for pre-kindergarten through 2nd grade during the summer, and grades 9–12 during the school year.\n\nWhat sets Mr. Roth apart is his meticulous attention to detail, exceptional communication skills, and his innate ability to make each student feel special. He creates a welcoming classroom environment where every student is valued and encouraged to strive for academic and personal growth. His knack for pinpointing each student’s strengths and providing any necessary support has had a positive impact on their overall success. He instills confidence in his students, showing them that they are capable of accomplishing anything they set their minds to. Mr. Roth says, “Acknowledging the small things students do add up: participating in the live lessons, attending help sessions just to say hello, or sending me a text message to let me know what is going on in their lives. Pointing out these behaviors and thanking students for doing such things helps build a rapport with them.”\n\nMr. Roth appreciates the opportunity to interact with students from different parts of the state, country, and even the world. This diverse interaction is something he cherishes, as it gives him the opportunity to facilitate learning among students from various backgrounds.\n\nAnother aspect he enjoys is seeing students lift one another up. “There are many times during a live lesson or help session that students compliment each other. Whether it be a new haircut, a shirt they are wearing, or an answer they gave to a question, these are the moments that I enjoy most and I make it a point to show how proud I am when these behaviors are displayed. The care and concern they have for each other really displays how awesome our middle school marvels are.”\n\nMr. Roth’s hero, Corrie ten Boom, a Dutch woman revered for helping many Jews escape the Nazi Holocaust, reflects his own values of selflessness, service, and faith.\n\nAn Ohio native, currently residing in Flagstaff, Mr. Roth spends his free time embracing the beautiful terrain and scenery of Northern Arizona. He enjoys biking, running, and hiking. Mr. Roth’s well-rounded character and dedication have rightfully earned him the title of ASU Prep’s 2023 Teacher of the Year.\n\nMeet Staff Member of the Year: Allison Voltaire\n\nAllison Voltaire, ASU Prep Digital Elementary Principal, began her teaching journey as a 6th grade teacher before transitioning to virtual roles in middle school math, 4th Grade, and 5th Grade. Her passion for leadership led her to earning a Master’s Degree in Educational Leadership and another in Curriculum and Instruction: Technology for Educators, and ultimately to ASU Prep in 2020.\n\nLiving on the Space Coast of Florida with her husband and two children, Ms. Voltaire manages her role virtually, valuing each interaction with ASU Prep stakeholders as an opportunity to reinforce her commitment to the school community. At the heart of Ms. Voltaire’s leadership approach is communication and teamwork. She explains, “We call this the tripod effect when a student, parent or home educator, and the teacher/Learning Success Coach work together as an academic team to support each student.” This approach centers the student and fosters engagement, motivation, and dedication within the school community, creating a vibrant learning environment.\n\nMs. Voltaire’s vision aligns with ASU Prep Academy’s promise to help students “Prep for college. Prep for careers. Prep for life.” She prioritizes academic excellence alongside the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and socialization skills. Embracing the digital nature of the school, she equips students with digital literacy and technology fluency, enabling them to confidently navigate digital tools and platforms for effective learning.\n\nBy fostering a personalized learning environment, Ms. Voltaire encourages students to take ownership of their education, setting goals, and embracing self-directed learning. She also aims to cultivate global awareness and cultural competence, preparing students to become responsible global citizens. “By appreciating diversity, demonstrating empathy, and understanding different cultures, our students will be better prepared to become responsible global citizens, making positive contributions to the world.”\n\nMs. Voltaire shares, “My ultimate goal is for our students to develop a lifelong love for learning, extending well beyond their time at ASU Prep Digital. By fostering this love for learning, I hope to nurture individuals who are eager to explore new ideas, pursue knowledge, and continue growing throughout their lives.”\n\nReflecting on her time at ASU Prep Digital, Ms. Voltaire recalls the second year of the elementary school as a defining moment. This was when perceptions shifted post-Covid pandemic, and ASU Prep Digital was recognized not as a mere fill-in option, but as a truly extraordinary digital school offering unparalleled opportunities for personalized learning. This shift embodies the mission of the school and reflects the dedication and hard work of the entire community.\n\nAs the 2023 Staff Member of the Year, Ms. Voltaire extends her heartfelt gratitude to the school community for their unwavering commitment to shared vision. Honored to be part of this remarkable journey, she looks forward to continuing the path of excellence and innovation at ASU Prep.\n\nThank you Eric Roth and Allison Voltaire for your exceptional service. From all of us at ASU Prep, congratulations on this well-deserved recognition. Here’s to another year of growth, discovery, and countless achievements.\n\nSummer Tips: Get Kids Out of the House\n\nLearning should be – and can be – fun. Summer is the perfect time to engage young learners in meaningful opportunities to be curious, to explore, and to discover new interests. Check out this list of fun yet educational (and often free) activities to get your kids out of the house and learning this summer.\n\nTry Geocaching: A combination of technology and active outdoor time, “The world’s largest treasure hunt” involves searching for hidden items in a specific geographical area using GPS coordinates on your smart device. Create a free account on www.geocaching.com and download the app. Choose a cache to find based on area and level of difficulty and head out for adventure.\n\nGo on a Scavenger Hunt: Apps like Monkey Spot or Goosechase include scavenger hunts kids can do outdoors or in everyday places like the grocery store, finding assigned objects. You can also search online for free printable scavenger hunts by topic — seasonal, outdoor or color/alphabet-themed.\n\nExplore Outdoors: Discover history and culture and connect with nature at a state or national park. The National Park Service offers a Junior Ranger program with interactive activities that give kids a chance to earn a badge and certificate. Bonus: Fourth graders can visit America’s National Parks for free with an Every Kid Outdoors pass.\n\nRoam a Local Garden: Let kids explore exhibits, feed fish, and identify types of flowers. The Japanese Friendship Garden in Phoenix offers free admission 5:00-7:30 p.m. on the first Friday of every month, and The Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix hosts Community Day with free admission on the second Tuesday of the month. Search online to find more beautiful gardens and special deals to explore.\n\nTour a Museum or Science Center: Check online for nearby museums of art or history as well as science centers for hours, special activities, and free admission opportunities. Some options near our ASU Prep campuses include Heard Museum, Phoenix Art Museum, Children’s Museum of Phoenix, and Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nThrough Museums for All, families presenting their SNAP EBT card can gain free or reduced admission to participating venues, and some banks offer their cardholders free or discounted museum passes. Check out an Act One Culture Pass from a public library to gain free access to Arizona’s arts and cultural treasures.\n\nVisit a Zoo or Aquarium. Check out animal encounters, tour habitats, learn about endangered species, get involved in conservation efforts, and take advantage of play areas.\n\nTry Something New: Research local kid-oriented classes and workshops like pottery, painting, cooking, bird-watching, coding, or photography. Consider looking into Lowe’s or Home Depot’s building workshops or events held at nearby craft stores. Perhaps a new physical activity like gymnastics, martial arts, indoor rock climbing, dance, or ninja warrior training would be a good fit.\n\nStop in the Local Library: Local public libraries don’t only offer books for free check-out, but also host story time and hands-on activities like crafts, as well as interactive demonstrations like a magic show or science experiment.\n\nCan’t Get Out of the House? Take your kids on a virtual field trip from the comfort of home to places like the Louvre in France or the famous Monterey Bay Aquarium. Tune in to one of the many educational programs offered on YouTube or keep kids busy with an at-home scavenger hunt.\n\nNo matter where this summer takes you and your family, try to include fun learning opportunities for the kids. When planning outdoor activities, be sure to consider the weather. Wear sun protection, hydrate, and have fun!\n\nSummer Tips: Making Financial Literacy a Healthy Habit\n\nWe spend a lot of time encouraging children to maintain healthy habits, from eating their veggies and brushing their teeth to practicing internet safety and being kind to others. Let’s add another healthy habit to the list: financial literacy.\n\nFinancial literacy should be introduced when kids are young and should include understanding “money basics” like expenses, budgeting, and saving. Learning money management is a healthy habit that will help kids make better decisions long-term. Try the following tips this summer to practice financial literacy with all ages.\n\nTalk about money. When making money decisions, think aloud to model this behavior for kids. When shopping, let them know when you’re comparing costs — considering sale prices or inspecting tags for the unit price, for example. Point out the use of coupons, weighing your needs versus wants and price markups in certain situations like entertainment venues.\n\nAssign money-related tasks. Have children assist with bill-paying when dining out. Younger kids can simply hand a server credit card or cash (then deal with the change), while older children can help calculate the tip and total cost. When shopping, encourage kids to scan items at the self checkout so they can see the items add up and be more aware of the growing total, as well as the role of tax.\n\nCreate a budget. Include children in budgeting for summer plans. Whether it’s for summer camps or a family outing, define an allowance and have kids help determine how to spend it. For example, set aside $50 for family night and let them figure out if that’s enough for a movie plus snacks at the theater or if it would be better spent with dinner out and a movie at home.\n\nPlay games. Make learning about money fun through gameplay. Monopoly (or Monopoly Jr.) is a popular board game where players buy and trade properties and deal with rent. Other games that involve money are The Game of Life, Payday, Money Bags, or The Allowance Game. There are also apps focused on financial literacy, such as Peter Pig’s Money Counter or Cash Puzzler.\n\nTeach value through ownership. When children earn their own money, whether through chores or a part-time job, they will be more likely to value it. Have them track their hard-earned funds using an age-appropriate app like Rooster Money or Bankaroo. Older children might be interested in Greenlight, a debit card for kids that requires parent oversight. Discuss options for managing money responsibly, from a savings account to investing in stocks.\n\nBeing confident when it comes to interacting with money is a healthy habit that sets up kids for success well into their future. With the extra expenses of summer, like camps, vacations and meals, it is an ideal time to start a conversation and include children in money matters.\n\nMinority Mental Health Month: Tips for Prioritizing Wellness\n\nObserved in July, National Minority Mental Health Month brings awareness to the unique challenges faced by our nation’s diverse minority groups. Due in part to a history of cultural stigma and lack of access to health care services, these groups often struggle to receive diagnoses for behavioral health issues.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautions that health disparities faced by underrepresented communities “negatively affect the mental and physical health of millions of people, preventing them from attaining their highest level of health and consequently affecting the health of our nation.”\n\nWhen it comes to managing mental health, this year’s theme centers around culture, community, and connection. Check out the following suggestions to get started prioritizing mental wellness for the whole family.\n\nCreate Connections with Others. It is important to feel a sense of belonging and security within our neighborhoods. Activities like shopping, dining, exercise or worship bring an opportunity to build social connections. This can lead to an extended support network of people to assist with childcare or meals when needed, as well as shared family friendly gatherings. Meaningful interactions and having people to call upon are essential stress relievers.\n\nBe an Active Community Member. Community brings more than social connections; it’s also an opportunity to find purpose. Take pride in where you live and work to make it a better place through volunteering and advocacy work. Get involved in issues you care about (like education or health services) through rallies or town hall meetings. Be sure to enlist children’s help when appropriate, like charity walks or collecting donations.\n\nTake Time for Self-care. Be sure to care for both your body and mind. To reduce stress and anxiety, consider meditation, breathing exercises, or yoga — find helpful guides on YouTube or in the app store. Listening to music, keeping a gratitude journal, praying, or reading are also healthy calming practices. For physical health, aim for a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains and limit simple sugars and saturated fats. A routine of regular exercise and sufficient sleep round out a healthy lifestyle.\n\nTalk Openly about Mental Health. Develop an environment of openness and trust that allows you and others to feel comfortable discussing mental health. Some pointers for these types of conversations include setting aside appropriate time and space, being honest, and validating emotions without downplaying or dismissing them. This can no doubt be difficult, but increasing visibility of mental health issues within minority communities breaks the stigma and encourages people to get support when needed.\n\nSeek Resources. In addition to commonly experienced life stressors, minority groups may also be impacted by additional trauma. Therapy provides tools so you can better handle the past, present and future in a healthier way. Seek a culturally competent therapist who is respectful of differences, appreciating that everyone has a unique identity and set of needs. To find a mental health program or resources that are a good fit, check out FindTreatment.gov, search the directory at Mental Health America or American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s extensive list of inclusive resourcesorganized by community. For free, immediate, and confidential support at any time, call or text 988, the Suicude and Crisis Lifeline.\n\nWhen focusing on mental wellness, remember to keep in mind the importance of culture, community, and connection. When intertwined, you’ll find support and belonging to help you better navigate daily life.\n\nSummer + Boot Camp = Thriving Teachers\n\nSummer is quickly on its way and you may have vacation on your mind. We don’t blame you. But let’s be honest, even while you’re sipping lemonade poolside or escaping the heat inside your local bookstore, you’ll still be thinking about improving your craft. You’ll spot a new book on the shelf and think, “That would make a great read aloud” and then you’re spending hours on the internet searching tie-in activities from science experiments and art projects to multimedia presentations.\n\nHow do we muster that level of excitement for more formal professional development? Here are five tips for making the most of your next professional learning experience.\n\nFind a topic that interests you. Don’t think of professional development as only a box that needs to be checked off your to-do list. Sure, you’ll earn the PD credits, but peruse the catalog for offerings that you’ll enjoy and learn from, whether it’s incorporating more technology, improving project-based assignments, or engaging your students in the classroom. Ellie Reich, Professional Development Product Manager at ASU Prep Digital reminds us, “Time flies when you are interested and excited to engage.”\n\nSet aside dedicated PD time on your calendar. It’s easy to postpone professional development because of busy schedules, so go ahead and mark it on your calendar, making it a priority. Be sure not to double book with other appointments or responsibilities, like child care. Ms. Reich prefers scheduling professional development early in the summer while the positives and negatives of the school year are still fresh on her mind. Her approach is to apply new learnings to class content for the fall so she can then “focus on family and relaxation the rest of summer.”\n\nGet comfortable and be present. Determine where you focus and learn best. This could be a coffee shop with your favorite drink or your home office while in pajamas. Relax, tune out distractions, and prepare to be involved. Alison Hernandez, Director of Professional Development & Learning Initiatives at ASU Prep Digital encourages participants to be present by being “proactive and engaged by asking questions, sharing insights, and engaging in discussions during the sessions.”\n\nFind a friend. Invite a peer to register for the same course so that you can exchange ideas, enhancing the learning experience. Ms. Hernandez encourages participants to “take advantage of the time to connect with other educators and to build meaningful relationships.” Ms. Reich wholeheartedly agrees, adding that working from a coffee shop with a colleague and bouncing off ideas is a winning combination.\n\nBe sure to reflect. After the training has ended, spend some time reflecting while the concepts are fresh in your mind and you’re feeling inspired to implement new ideas. Jot down some notes or text a colleague to keep the momentum, learning, and collaboration going. “Professional development is an ongoing process,” says Ms. Hernandez, “Stay curious and be proactive about seeking new learning opportunities.”\n\nReady to seek out your next great professional development opportunity?

When children are in good mental health, they will be more successful at home and school, better able to participate and socially engage, learn new things and exhibit good decision-making.\n\nFamilies can promote good mental health in what they say, how they act, and through the environment they create. Take a look at these suggestions for fostering a supportive environment for children and teens.\n\nRecognizing Emotions\n\nIt’s important for children to be able to recognize their feelings as the first step in processing them. For younger children, this might mean using a mood chart that allows them to identify a graphic depicting their current emotion. This check-in opens up the conversation for them to better share and get support. For older children, a journal with blank pages or guiding prompts is a positive and personal way to process feelings before discussing them.\n\nCreate a Safe Setting\n\nNurture relationships by spending quality time together talking without judgment. A helpful technique is “High, Low, Buffalo,” in which each family member shares a “high” point from their day, a “low,” and a “buffalo” — a random tidbit. An Internet search for “conversation starters” can also be a fun way to ignite meaningful discussion with older children.\n\nA safe home environment also means setting boundaries on media use. Monitor use by discouraging screens in the bedrooms when possible to allow you to supervise both content and time spent on a screen, as well as any interactions through social media or online games.\n\nModel & Encourage Healthy Behavior\n\nDon’t be afraid to show kids when you struggle or make a mistake. It’s normal, and as they’re watching, they’re learning valuable coping skills.\n\nBe a role model by taking care of your own mental health—discussing feelings and modeling what it looks like to make time for feel-good activities like reading, exercising or relaxing on the porch.\n\nEstablish routines for the whole family that prioritize a nutritious diet, regular physical activity and plenty of sleep.\n\nGet Professional Support\n\nBeing involved in children’s lives allows us to regularly observe their well-being and track any signs that a child is experiencing changes in their thinking, feelings or behavior, as well as physical changes.\n\nAs children navigate developmental and emotional milestones, continue to show them encouragement. Connect with them, reminding them that you care and are there for support.\n\nNeed help?

We recently celebrated these remarkable educators during Teacher Appreciation Week with a little extra recognition and gratitude.\n\nThe school year is quickly coming to an end, so what’s a guaranteed way to make our teachers and staff feel valued while also motivating them to keep up their school spirit? Apparently, it’s food! Together with the ASU Prep Academy network, our wonderful Parent Teacher Organization, local businesses and supportive families across all campuses, we were able to treat our teachers to a special week of goodies.\n\nTreating Teachers Across All ASU Prep Campuses\n\nAcross the network of ASU Prep Academy schools, teachers received gift cards to the ASU Prep store, inspirational videos and messages, as well as a hosted lunch from Honeybaked Ham or Elias the Foodie food truck.\n\nASU Prep Digital\n\nBecause ASU Prep Digital is primarily online, their staff received virtual recognition throughout the week, from special messages from their principals to motivational videos sent from the ASU Prep Digital administration team.\n\nASU Prep Phoenix\n\nThe Phoenix campus was shown a lot of support (and food!) from the surrounding community with donations from Einstein Bros., Stern Produce, Sugar & Lace Bakery, Potbelly, Frios Gourmet Pops and a delicious charcuterie board assembled by a talented parent.\n\nASU Prep Polytechnic\n\nThe ASU Prep Polytechnic K–6 program was treated to a literary-themed week that included several favorites: books, puns, food, and an opportunity for student involvement. A standout day from the weeklong festivities highlighted the book Dragons Love Tacos with the slogan “Taco ‘bout our nacho average teachers & staff” with a lunchtime taco and nacho bar. Students were also encouraged to bring their teacher a dragon-fire red gift, which brought lots of creativity and smiles.\n\nASU Prep South Phoenix\n\nThe South Phoenix high school program told their staff “mahalo” with a Hawaiian-themed week of “tiki-riffic” treats including an ice cream bar, afternoon slushie break, and BBQ lunch from Ono. The elementary program hosted Hollywood week, pampering their staff like celebrities with movie-style popcorn, personalized gifts, a swag bag of surprises, and lunch catered by Federico’s.\n\nASU Prep Pilgrim Rest\n\nAt ASU Prep Pilgrim Rest, each day brought a new treat, like Wake Up Monday (a coffee theme), Toolbox Tuesday (a call for students to bring in school supplies), and Thankful Thursday (thoughtful notes written to teachers and a morning cheer session to start the day).\n\nASU Prep Casa Grande\n\nASU Prep Casa Grande kept their staff happy with food throughout the week, including breakfast, a PTO-sponsored lunch and a midweek treat of delicious cookies donated by Cook-E-Jar.\n\nThank Our Teachers Anytime\n\nNo need to wait until May’s Teacher Appreciation festivities to make teachers feel special. Treat staff all school year long with a snack or school supply bundle. If you know a teacher has a school night event or a pile of essays to grade, help them power through with a $5 gift card to grab a coffee. Remember, a thoughtful email or handwritten note from a guardian or student is easy, free and always makes a major impact.\n\nAnti-Bullying Tips for a Positive Community\n\nWhile many Star Wars fans were busy celebrating “May the Fourth Be With You,” ASU Prep Academy was also recognizing May 4th as Anti-Bullying Day with a focus on digital citizenship. Just as there are powerful alliances formed in the Star Wars franchise, ASU Prep Academy encourages students to come together to support and encourage one another. Here are some anti-bullying tips to foster a positive community.\n\nHold That Thought\n\nGetting ready to post that picture with a filter that makes your classmate look like a furry Ewok? Remember not to post photos or videos of others without permission, especially those who are minors. While you think your classmate’s Ewok impression is spot-on, she may not appreciate it going viral.\n\nAnd just like we use a filter to enhance photos, let’s do the same for our comments. Filter your thoughts before posting them to make sure they are truthful and kind. Avoid teasing and sarcasm, which don’t usually translate well online. Instead of jokingly commenting on a friend’s post about his new Mandalorian backpack, “You’re such a dork!” try “Love your style!” instead.\n\nLeave a *Good* Lasting Impression\n\nEverything we do online leaves behind a trail. Everything from social media posts to search history. So make sure the prints you leave behind are good ones you wouldn’t be embarrassed for your teachers, family members or future boss to discover.\n\nASU Prep Academy Supports You\n\nASU Prep does not tolerate bullying, harassing or intimidating others on school grounds, school-sponsored events, or through use of technology. Any reports of such behavior will be investigated and may lead to disciplinary action like a guardian conference, or in serious cases, removal from the school community.\n\nConnect in a Positive Way\n\nShow your school spirit by posting positive accomplishments like club activities or the triumphant completion of a project. Finally finished your watercolor of Yoda? Post it! When sharing your Sun Devil successes, strengthen our community connection by tagging #RepthePrep and #ASUPrepAcademy.\n\nCheers to Our 2023 Staff Member of the Year Nominees\n\nOn behalf of ASU Preparatory Academy, we want to recognize our outstanding education support personnel for their significant contributions to our school and students.
