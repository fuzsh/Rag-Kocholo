This week we’re sticking close to our HQ in the Bay Area and focusing our #CollegeFactsFriday on The University of California, Berkeley!

1. UC Berkeley is rated as the Number 1. Public University worldwide by US News & World Report.

2. The mascot for UC Berkeley is known as “Oski”, a golden bear.

3. UC Berkeley was founded in 1868 and has the motto “Fiat Lux” which translates roughly to “let light be made”.

4. The colors for UC Berkeley are Blue and Gold, chosen in 1873. Blue represents the Californian sky and for the Yale graduates that helped establish the University, and gold represents “Golden State”.

5. Many Californian based students and families will be aware of the “Stanford Axe” and the big game between the two schools. The tradition began in 1899 at a Cal v Stanford baseball game, when the axe was brandished at the Stanford rooting section and captured by Cal fans at games end. It was made into the trophy for the annual Big Game in the 1930’s.

6. UC Berkeley has 14 schools and colleges, including Environmental Design, Journalism and Law.

7. A fun student tradition is to rub the stone ball in front of the Campanile before an exam. It has been dubbed the “4.0 ball” and is considered good luck.

8. There are many clubs, activities and student groups to get involved with at UC Berkeley, in fact there are over 1,000 student groups alone. You can search through them here.

9. The University Botanical Garden is 34-acres and has over 10,000 types of plants including many rare and endangered species. It’s also incredibly beautiful!
