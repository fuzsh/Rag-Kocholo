MAKING A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE

When Tampa-based Berkeley Preparatory School approached Catalone Design, they had just adopted a new tagline—“Berkeley puts people in the world who make a positive difference”—and sought help integrating it into their communications. What followed was a comprehensive branding effort that encompassed everything from a new logo and graphic standards manual to a viewbook and campaign case statement. To build on the tagline, a common theme of the print pieces is a focus on Berkeley people—students, teachers, coaches, alumni—and on the different ways they make a positive difference.
