And just like that another cohort of the PREP and T-PREP summer programs is in the books. This is my tenth summer at UC Berkeley and although last year we came back in person this year we brought back some pre-pandemic events such as the professional networking/etiquette dinner. Study groups were formed and the seeds of life-long friendships were planted. I am in awe of the role of alumni and their involvement in their year's program from running an entire Maker Design Studio Scott Moura to the day to day leadership of the program. The last day of the program is always a very special day and seeing alumni who came back to be judges or just to pop in and say hi to the new cohort truly makes me understand just how valuable this community is. Although the summer portion of the program has ended, this is only the beginning of their time as Berkeley Engineers and I am very excited for them to meet the rest of the gemstones from previous cohorts. There are far too many people to thank but let me start with the small but mighty Berkeley Engineering Programs Team Marvin J. Lopez Luis E. Castillo, Crystal Banuelos Marcia Breslin-Cantillana. As I reflect on the the last three weeks I can't help but think of a quote that encapsulates this summer's activities ":teamwork divides the task and multiplies the successes."
