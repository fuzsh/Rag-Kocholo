        "text": "Croatia Food Trail by Pinky Eppaturi\n\nSome years ago I had travelled with a friend called Marc whose ancestors had migrated from Croatia to the U.S. A recommended dream vacation he said would be one to his roots, to Croatia.\n\nLately my girlfriends Melitta and Arleen proposed to take a vacation to an offbeat destination. I instantly remembered Marc raving about the pristine clear beaches and sparkling turquoise waters of Croatia, its great cuisine, the history and beauty of its cities like Split,Zadar ,Dubrovnik,Hvar,Trstenik, some which I could not pronounce and its ultimate natural beauties like the Krka Waterfalls or the protected Plitvice Lakes and National Park, a UNESCO heritage site.\n\nWithout a local companion we did have to consider the safety aspect of three girls travelling by themselves to a land and language less known. After some reading up about a small country with lots to see and some episodes of the ‘ Game of Thrones ‘, the extra caution got thrown to the winds, and we set off like Charlie’s Angels to the land, home to the King’s Landing and the Red Keep.\n\nI can’t brag about beginners’ luck because as soon as we landed in Zagreb, we had a problem with our bookings.\n\nThe helpful tourist information center at the airport recommended a hotel and its staff very warmly helped us manage all our subsequent bookings and also recommended taking a casual cruise to see the Dalmatian islands.\n\nCompletely spent with our long trip and the struggle over accommodation all we wanted to do was have a meal and sleep. The empathizing hotel staff brightened our spirits by telling us about Croatia’s rich gastronomic tradition. Food served in a Restoran (restaurant) or a Konoba (tavern) was high not only in taste but also quality as more fresh ingredients were used than preserved food. Besides Croatian cuisine, Bosnian and Slovenian food were also served here. Homemade pasta, truffles, meat, sea food are a Croatian specialty. They also asked us to choose meat that night over sea food as we would have plenty of it on the Dalmatian islands.\n\nNearby Restoran Sofra was recommended for an authentic Bosnian dinner. As we headed out, fatigue highly affected our sense of direction and we were unable to find the Restoran inspite of the easy directions given to us at the hotel. Luckily English was widely spoken and visible on all signage. With a little help from friendly locals we made it.\n\nAt Restoran Sofra without much debate we ordered the Pungeni Hadzijski Odrezak ,a veal stuffed steak with cream in vegetables sauce and rice and Kapama ‘Sofra’ ,a lamb and onion stew served with spinach. The star dish was the traditional Bosanski Lonac or the Bosnian Pot containing beef, lamb, garlic, vegetables, whole pepper corns and potato. Originally Bosanski Lonac was made in ceramic pots that were put in a fire place or pit in the ground. But today since not everyone has a fireplace for cooking, a regular pot and a kitchen stove are used. Feeling tired to choose an exquisite wine we stuck to the house white variety. The portions were huge and though we thoroughly enjoyed the meals we could not finish them. Fully ‘fed’ up we returned to the hotel and slept for twelve hours straight.\n\nNext day after a late and hearty breakfast we took the famous Zagreb Blue Tram to the compact City Centre and visited the easily walkable attractions like the Ban Jelacic Square,Zagreb Cathedral and St. Mark’s Square and Church. The city also has a Museum of Broken Relationships !\n\nSt Mark’s Church , Zagreb\n\nSince breakfast was huge, for lunch, we settled for a bottle of fruity and fresh Istrian white wine called Degrassi Terre Bianche Cuvee Blanc and some Paski sir or cheese from Pag (a hard piquant sheep cheese which is a cross between Parmesan and mature cheddar) and the highly recommended pršut, Croatia’s excellent home cured ham from the Dolac Market which is an outdoor Farmers’ Market, sat at the Square and relished our snacks.\n\nPag Cheese , Paski sir and pršut\n\nThe food choices so far had been so rewarding that we were looking forward to dinner. We chatted about our trip to follow and while we were excited about seeing the locales we didn’t like the idea of moving around Croatia so much so quickly.\n\nAfter our long walk where we had explored Zagreb town in four hours flat, we headed for dinner to Restoran Lanterna na Dolcu near the Zagreb Cathedral. From past meals we had learnt that Croatian meal portions were huge and decided to order just two main dishes between the three of us. None of us wanted any salad or starters. We ordered the Beef Pašticada which is a preparation of beef cooked with wine and prunes. Mel and I chose a glass of Istrian Malvazia white wine alongside while Arlene chose the red Gran Teran .What had caught my attention was Homemade Pasta with Truffles. I had always wanted to taste truffles as it is a delicacy.\n\nBeef Pašticada\n\nPasta with Truffles\n\nThe steward was a friendly, resourceful person. Taking note of his approachability we asked him if safety was an issue if we got back to the hotel too late. He reassured us that Croatians take tourism very seriously as a major part of the country’s earnings come from their limited tourism months. Citizens contribute by ensuring cooperation to visitors and keeping Croatia safe and crime free.\n\nWhile the city was safe, the delectable beef pašticada was sinfully unsafe for our waistlines. The aroma of the truffle that came with the homemade pasta took our breath away. The pasta was tender and the addition of the truffle made it exotic. We understood why truffles were so expensive besides them being hard to acquire.\n\nOur resourceful steward gave us some advice and trivia on truffles. White truffles are more expensive than their black counterparts. Whether we bought black or white truffles the best company to buy from is Zigante. It holds a Guinness book record for the largest truffle discovered which they served over dinner to guests in the village where it was found. If it were sold it would have fetched the price of gold.\n\nLargest Truffle holding a Guiness Book Record\n\nZigante also markets wine, olive oil, carefully selected fresh products, preserved white and black truffles, shaved truffle, truffles combined with olive oil, honey, mushrooms or other ingredients, around fifty products of high quality. If we were visiting Istria he recommended dining at the Zigante restaurant in the village of Livade for an expensive yet unforgettable meal served with truffles and to view the bronze replica of the Guinness record holding giant white truffle. If up for dessert, they also serve Black Truffle Vanilla ice cream.\n\nZagreb while not a priority on a visitor’s list in Croatia, was a gastronomical delight. There might have been less to see but there sure was a lot to eat and drink.\n\nNext morning we set off to Plitvice lakes and National Park (UNESCO protected). This was Mother Nature at her gorgeous best. Open throughout the year and breathtakingly beautiful even when the lakes are frozen in the winter, the Upper lakes and lower lakes, cascading waterfalls, hiking trails, the pristine waters all explain why this is a highly visited place. The ideal thing is to stay at a hotel in the park. This place being more about nature has few restaurants that close early. After a superb fresh fish dinner we had some Croatian dessert wine called Prošek at Hotel Plitvice which is open late. Though this is a high end property the meal prices are highly economical.\n\nPlitvice lakes and National Park\n\nProšek is produced from any one or a blend of several different varieties of white wines like bogdanuša, dubrovačka malvasija, grk, malvazija istarska, maraština, pošip, tarpinka, trbljan, vugava, and žlahtina or red varieties like babić, lasina, and plavac mali.\n\nOne can taste the characteristics of dried fig, raisin nectar, candied orange peel, and roasted nut found in the wine’s sunbaked, seaside southern Dalmatian terroir. Though a little too sweet for the taste of most Croatians, as per winemaker Alen Bibić ‘with a sip of Prošek, you can feel the Mediterranean”.\n\nProšek Dessert Wine\n\nDepending on the types of grapes used and the age of the wine, the color of Prošek can range from deep gold to amber, neon orange, maple syrup, and dark brown.\n\nThe following day we set off on a comfortable but long six hour bus journey to Split from where we would take our cruise the next day. The drive to the coastal Dalmatian city termed as the Mediterranean flower and ‘the sportiest city’ of the world was a panoramic delight.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to see that the owner of our apartment had come to pick us up at the bus station which was also near the port and the Diocletian’s Palace.\n\nAt the apartment we forgot that we were weary, freshened up in minutes and excitedly walked up to the Diocletian ‘s Palace which in our world is better known as the walls within which Daenerys from the Game of thrones, fought the slave-owner overlords the Mereen and Yunkai and returned to Westeros as the victorious queen.\n\nA Game of thrones tour was a must but we decided to leave that for the time when we would return from the cruise.\n\nTonight, we were going to eat an affordable meal with a choice of restaurants and bars in a Palace!\n\nOne of the Entrances to Diocletian’s Palace\n\nPopular fiction aside the Diocletian Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site, constructed by Emperor Diocletian is possibly the best preserved Roman palace with well-maintained streets enriched with gothic and renaissance buildings. Unlike elsewhere the palace is open to visitors all day except a few sections. People have homes, restaurants, shops, travel agencies in the lanes of the palace itself! We decided to start traditionally by making a wish at the Grgur Ninski Statue. Tomorrow we would embark on an eight day cruise and wished for safety, new friends, unforgettable memories and fun.\n\nGrgur Ninski\n\nIn the by lanes of the palace itself we were spoiled for choice. What was our heart set on today? A sushi bar, a seafood pizza, pasta, mussels, buffet, a restaurant called ‘No Stress’, all within the palace walls.\n\nWe decided to start with Uje Oil Bar which offers approximately fifty types of olive oil and fresh traditional Dalmatian cuisine based on a new concept of eating health conscious food. I had tasted and drunk wine in life but this was the first time someone had recommended pouring some olive oil in a glass and sipping it. I still prefer the taste of wine but definitely I bought myself some more years of youth and good health with the little bit of olive oil that I managed to drink. Paired with that was fresh pršut and fish along with a glass of wine. All the food was fresh and organic.\n\nInside Uje Oil Bar with a shot of fresh olive oil and Medica, a traditional Croatian honey liqueur alongside\n\nInterestingly right next to the Oil Bar are Uje Wine Bar, Uje cocktail bar, and Pikulece, which is a Dalmatian tapas bar for better understanding of visitors.\n\nCroatia not willing to succumb to the pressure of processed foods is unique as most of its produce is organic. Whether you choose meat or the excellent seafood one taste of the meal in your mouth and you can feel the freshness. Additionally the friendly and patient stewards are always willing to help you in exploring the local cuisine.\n\nWe intentionally ate small at Uje oil Bar as a restaurant called Mazzgoon which served traditional Dalmatian cuisine and wine had caught our fancy and we wanted to have dinner there.\n\nAt Mazzgoon,we sat outside on the chairs in the street, though I would prefer to call it the Palace courtyard. If you sit inside the restaurant you can have a full view of the kitchen staff working hard to set up meals for the guests. The menu was printed on a brown paper bag. Our dinner order consisted of the Gnocchi stuffed with shrimp, Sea bass and grilled Octopus with potatoes. Paired brilliantly with a recommended bottle of Grk white wine from Dalmatinska Zagora vineyards all choices resulted to be delicious.\n\nWhile leaving Mazzgoon we were given a paper bag with an inspirational quote on it.\n\nBefore heading home we passed the Peristil Square , the main square in the Diocletian’s palace near the St Duje’s Cathedral and noticed that the Luxor Cafe and Bar there had placed cushions on few sections of the steps on the square. People that had bought drinks from Luxor were sitting on these cushions and enjoying their drinks in an open air arrangement. The singers outside the bar were singing and playing live music till the wee hours of the night making the atmosphere highly romantic. We were surely returning here to drink and chill out after our cruise brought us back to Split. Or maybe with the blessings of Grgur Ninski, I will find a mate on my trip and spend an unending evening of Croatian stories under the stars with him.\n\nLuxor Outdoor Cafe\n\nWe didn’t t want to lug our bags from one island to another, while keeping up with the schedule of the ferries and bearing with dissimilar check in times at accommodation arranged. With local recommendation we had discovered that a highly comfortable and luxurious way of seeing the Dalmatian Islands would be via a cruise and used the services of an agency called Katarina Line and booked an eight day cruise.\n\nAt Split port, our jaws dropped when we found ourselves facing an ultra-modern boat called Sea Gull in the name of a casual cruise!!\n\nView of the Sea Gull A+ Ship from Trestenik Island\n\nMy Cabin on board the Sea Gull\n\nStaff from the agency and the crew wore Katarina t shirts and stood around at the port making it easy to spot the boat. ‘We are the best crew in the world ‘, said the first officer Dominik as he picked up my bags. I smiled politely until I spotted the Captain’s nine year old daughter as part of the welcoming committee which left all of us beaming.\n\nSea gull is a small boat unlike massive cruise liners but it is an A+ ship, meaning an ultra-modern, posh equipment having a well-stocked bar, upper deck to sun bathe or hang out and no bunk beds. Some cabins have large tinted windows like a dream where one can lay and watch the water while sailing. They also have an in house chef with the highest degree in culinary art and fresh food made from ingredients purchased at every port.\n\nSpecial charters, Gay Cruises, Naturist (nudist) cruises were other cruise types offered on other boats with luxurious, lavishly designed ,fully air conditioned ensuite cabins, or if one preferred ,vintage or wooden sailing ships.\n\nFor welcome drinks the cheerful crew served us Ballantine’s Whisky, Pelinkovac,a bitter liqueur based on wormwood, very close to Jägermeister and traditional Croatian walnut liqueur Orahovac. Out of these the Orahovac instantly became popular with a lot of us.\n\nOrahovac is a delicious fruit liqueur produced from green walnuts with a slightly bitter taste.\n\nCommercially most of the Orahovac is produced and marketed by the Maraska Company as also served on the boat. If you drank it in a restaurant you may find that the beverage tastes different, either more sweet or bitter depending on the quantity of ingredients used.\n\nIf I liked it so much I could also make the liqueur myself, with a simple recipe containing green walnuts, well smashed,sugar,orange and lemon rind, a vanilla stick and some vodka, said Rade,one of the sailors . Most Croatians made Orahovac at home.\n\nThe cruise was for 8 days and starting from Split the pretty Dalmatian islands that were covered ahead were – Miljet (national park), Dubrovnik, Trestenik, Korcula,Hvar,Bol and we were to return and dock one night in Split. We realized that sailing was a favorite pastime of Croatians. Almost everyone on the islands had a boat of some size.\n\nEveryday breakfast and a three course lunch were served on board. Dinner we could eat at the ports. This was possibly our best introduction to Croatian cuisine.\n\nStarting from the snacks served with our welcome drinks every possible choice of healthy food options were served by the crew. Not even once were we served French fries or chips. Every port we docked on, they went shopping for fresh vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and local wines.\n\nDuring our on board meals we were treated to many traditional local Croatian dishes like octopus salad, fish soup, beef Pašticada, Brancin na Zaru – grilled John Dory fish, Crni risotto- risotto blackened with the ink of the squid, Brudet – Croatian sea food stew, Fuzi I pljukanci – homemade rolled pasta served with truffles and boskarin (ox) sauce, lots of fresh green salad and bread.\n\nGnocchi coloured with the ink of calamari served with prawns\n\nI could clearly see how Croatian cuisine was divided into coastal and interior. The coastal cuisine was more Mediterranean. Croatians proud of their culture told me a lot of stories of wars and victories with their Greek, Roman,Turkish,Italian,Serbian,Bosnian neighbours. The influence of all these nations could be tasted in their food.\n\nThe first port we docked on was Makarska. It was a pretty little coastal town with a small population. We went walking around taking in the fresh coastal air and enjoying the pebbled beaches with crystal clear waters.\n\nMonument dedicated to a tourist in Makarska\n\nPebbled beach in Makarska\n\nSome restaurants looked very inviting and we went around looking at their menus trying to choose one for dinner. Most of them were closing early. Some of the locals advised us to try the Kalelarga Street where most restaurants are open till late. Every corner of Makarska was gorgeous and we must have looked completely overwhelmed when we uttered loudly ‘ beautiful!’\n\nKalelarga Street\n\n‘Would you like to see something even more beautiful? ‘, spoke a voice around us. We turned to see a middle aged woman calling out to us. Could this be a commercial gimmick? Junk jewellery sale? Ah well, so far we had not had any unsafe experiences. Couldn’t hurt to just look.\n\nShe introduced herself as Goga and showed us around in her quaint restaurant called Stari Miln.it had a very pretty indoor and outdoor seating. That was not all. She took us to her garden where fresh olive, basil,oregano,rosemary,bay leaf ,sage were growing . If we chose to eat dinner here she would put those ingredients in the meal she would serve us. She also gave us a glass of wine and some wild asparagus to sample, a healthy addition to a Croatian meal.\n\nAt five thirty pm it was too early for dinner so we thanked her and took her leave. After our sightseeing and search for a restaurant was complete we realised that we could not get the Stari Miln experience out of our minds and returned there at dinner time. Goga received us with a warm welcome. Since we were already eating course wise meals on the cruise we decided to just have the main course. We had to have the bruschetta; Goga insisted and treated us to bruschetta with sundried tomatoes and olives from her garden and a glass of house wine. We chose a sea food meal with scallops and black and white mussels in a unique sauce that Goga would cook especially for us. While we were eating the bruschetta Goga made us smell all the herbs that she intended to put in our meal. ‘Is it too strong for you?’ Oh no, we said, after all being Indian we do have reputation of eating spicy food.\n\nOver a divine meal we chatted with Goga,the owner and chef of Stari Miln restaurant and shared stories of both Croatian and Indian culture. Meanwhile outside it started raining heavily with ‘burra ‘ or the Croatian term for strong winds. It was ten thirty then. What will you do now on this Saturday night? She asked us. Not much in this weather, besides returning to our boat which was docked on the port and sleep.\n\n‘Nonsense ‘, she said. ‘I’ll take you out’. Oh no! We didn’t want to trouble her. What about other guests? This being a small town it was less likely there would be more guests on a rainy evening. After a little bit of winding up Goga could be free. This was very sweet of her. While the other guests were eating she ran up to her house, returned with rain jackets for us, acquired her payments, closed her restaurant and we set off.\n\nWe followed Goga to ‘Club Deep‘, an incredible Cave Bar and night club by the pebbled beach. Braving the rain and the burra was completely worth it. This dual level club/ bar is literally located in a natural cave by the beach. It is an extremely popular place and gets packed. Getting drinks could be a problem but not for Goga who practically knew everyone there except tourists and managed to make her way to the bar. It was very hot in the club, a complete contrast from the atmosphere out of the Cave bar. People were escaping to the beach momentarily which was right outside.\n\nClub Deep Makarska\n\nWe danced to the great music and drank our hearts away and at 2am begged Goga to let us go. Looking a little disappointed and taking a promise to return she dropped us to our boat. The sailors had removed the gangway to enter and we had to jump back in the boat. Oh what a night!\n\nNext morning when we shared our experience with our cruise mates who had either returned early due to the storm or others who had trouble sleeping as the boat rocked due to the strong wind we realized that we had had the time of our lives. We also asked if removing the gangway was a usual practice in the night. The Captain apologized as he had not realized that we were still outside. They had done this for the storm and it was not going to happen every day.\n\nWe continued to sail, enjoying our dainty, posh cruise, making more friends every day and eating great Croatian food. Every port we docked ahead had lots to offer.\n\nAfter Miljet National park, for one night we docked in Dubrovnik. Dubrovnik, also known as ‘Pearl of the Adriatic’ is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today it is the most visited place in Croatia after Plitvice Lakes. Being chosen as a filming location of the ‘Game of thrones it may have been rechristened as ‘King’s Landing.’\n\nDubrovnik\n\nThe Walled City of Dubrovnik\n\nCroatia has a war history from 1991to 1995 where Dubrovnik was bombed heavily and destroyed. It is remarkable how well its people have restored the city .Look carefully and one can still see the traces of mortar damage and bullet shots in the streets and places like the Franciscan monastery.\n\nView of the Stradun\n\nWe decided to start our visit with the Fort of Lovrijenac which most people may have seen as the forbidden fortress often glimpsed as a backdrop to scenes filmed in Fort Bokar.\n\nFort of Lovrijenac\n\nThat done we returned to the ‘ King’s Landing ‘ for a walk on the Dubrovnik city walls.\n\nUp on the Dubrovnik City Walls with a view of Lokrum Island\n\nThat was a rewarding experience but it was very hot and we decided to stop for a drink. From atop the walls we had noticed people sitting at a bar at the cliff on the rocks and desired to go there. There were tiny cafes on top of the walls as well.\n\nWalking around the quaint, cobblestone streets we walked our way to a hole in the wall to a unique place called Buza Bar. Buza in Croatian means ‘hole’ which explains why Buza bar is also known as ‘hole in the wall’. This is the place we had seen from the City walls. It appeared to have been hung there on the cliffs so many metres right above the water .We enjoyed our drinks with a panoramic view of the Adriatic Sea and the Lokrum Island which was used in the Game of Thrones for scenes that take place in Qarth.People were also very easily walking down to the water from the bar for a swim in the sea or to put their feet in water.\n\nBuza Bar\n\nAs we were docking here just one night time management was paramount and we still had to visit Mount Srd. It was a tad difficult to pull ourselves out from such an extraordinary place. We promised to reward ourselves with more wine on our next stop Mt Srd. A cable car took us on top. Like children we rushed to the front of the cable car and watched Dubrovnik from each level till we reached the height of 400 m to find an extraordinary view of the Walled City. After a few pictures we decided to peek into the Panorama Restaurant and Cafe right on top of the mountain. There were full glass windows here and tables were placed right next to it. At that height this place must be highly commercial and expensive. Why not take a look at the menu? We were surprised to see international and Croatian meals at completely affordable prices. If we weren’t stuck on a specific restaurant we may have had dinner there. But a glass of Croatian Malvazia was compulsory. We had to celebrate being on top of the world.\n\nFrom the glass windows the vision of Lokrum island and Dubrovnik within its almost pentagon shaped exterior of the walls was breathtaking. Not just Dubrovnik, but the entire world was beneath us. Zivjeli! (Cheers)!\n\nPanorama Restaurant and Cafe with a view of Dubrovnik from Mt Srd\n\nAfter walking through the Stradun, more cobblestone streets, many Basilicas and even more recognisable locations from the Game of thrones, for dinner we settled for the Restoran recommended by our sailor friends called Lokanda- Peskarija right by the water, had a hearty Croatian sea food meal and more wine.\n\nLokanda- Peskarija\n\nBy evening the Old City of Dubrovnik magically transforms into a place with bars and restaurants playing different forms of music and promoting their food. We understood why it was so popular with tourists.\n\nEvening view of the Stradun\n\nSuch a fun place, if even to just walk around and soak in the atmosphere. Strolling around the local bars we tried some Medica, a traditional Croatian honey liqueur, Kruskovac, a pear liqueur and some Orahovac.\n\nNot being huge drinkers we had decided to take it easy on more drinks and thought of just looking around and enjoying the music and atmosphere.\n\nUntil destiny and a walk to a tiny side street took us to a wine bar called D’Vino. The atmosphere here both inside and outside the bar was very cosy and the sommeliers highly knowledgeable. They have an excellent selection of Croatian wines .We could do a tasting of three wines called ‘Wine Flights‘ for a very small fee around 50 kuna and finally select what we wanted to drink. Unlike my friends, I am normally not a red wine drinker but the enthusiastic Australian sommelier’s description of the opulent wines and their character got me sold on a glass of Dingač after the tasting. We felt like we had fallen into a brilliant, unregretful trap.\n\nRed Wine Flights at D’Vino Bar\n\nDingač, made from top quality fully ripened, manually picked Plavac Mali grape is probably the most famous Croatian red wine in the world with par excellence quality. It was protected in 1961 in Geneva by international conventions and was named after the Dingač Wine Region on the Pelješac peninsula. The aroma of the Plavac Mali is textured in this full bodied,dark ruby red colour wine. This top Dalmatian red wine is ideal complement to dark meat meals and fish best served chilled to the temperature of 18ºc.\n\nHey, we had to return to the boat now! A bus ride away, we made it easily to the Gruz (the port) and I giggled to see my heady girlfriends stagger into the boat. After the Makarska debacle there was always someone from the crew alert for guests like us returning late. The moment we stepped in the first officer Dominik very kindly invited us for a drink. My girlfriends passed, called it a night and returned to the cabin. I decided to stay for a bit but confessed that it would have to be just a tiny glass of wine, after the binge in the Old City.\n\nOver the drink , I shared my splendid day with Dominik, told him about how kicked we were about having visited all the familiar locations of the Game of thrones and wondered why they didn’t have a replica of the Iron Throne in Dubrovnik at least for a picture. I told him about the wide selection of Croatian wines at D’Vino Bar, their Australian sommelier and that I had tried the Dingač red wine after his deep, knowledgeable recommendation.\n\nDid he also tell you that Plavac Mali ,the well-known red wine grape in Croatia, is the basis of many of the nation’s most sought-after red wines?, Dominik asked me. Wine is a popular drink in Croatia, and locals traditionally like to drink wine with their meals. Besides Dingač, Plavac and Postup were other popular red wines made from the Plavac Mali grape.\n\nCroatian Red Wines\n\nBy the way, did I like the white wine I was drinking presently with him? Yes I did enjoy this splendid, straw-golden yellow colour wine. Rich and heavy it felt pleasant, harmonious and full-bodied on my palate. He explained that this was Pošip, a huge favourite with Croatians just like the Dingač. I sensed a little bit of Dominik’s possessiveness over all things Croatian, its wines and food and smiled away.\n\nA further port called Korcula, he went on to say, that we were going to dock on, was home to the Pošip and we could also do a wine tasting tour there.\n\nPošip is one of the first white wines to be protected by Croatian law. Traditionally grown in the central area of the island in the villages Smokvica and Čara, it has lately spread to other vineyards in the region. The name Posip is derived from the gently tapered profile of Pošip grapes, which resembles the curved side (the sip) of the traditional soil-tilling tools. Pošip is a perfect companion to all fish, shellfish, white meat dishes, green herb salad with pistachios or seafood broth with octopus best served at a temperature of 12-14 °C.\n\nWhile I drank Pošip, Dominik diluted his glass of white wine with sparkling water producing a drink he called gemišt while quite often a combination of red wine and still water called bevanda would be drunk by locals.\n\nAfter Korčula the next port Hvar is native to quality dry red wine with a pleasant, fresh and balanced taste, Plavac. The traditional production of Plavac on Hvar is very old and widespread all the way upto the Stari Grad town.If we came in June or July we could enjoy some Plavac watching the lavender fields in full bloom!\n\nAnother great red wine would be the full bodied Istrian Teran boasting of fruity flavours and dominating aromas making it a perfect match for Istrian ham, or other meat and game dishes.\n\n67% of Croatian wine produced is white and is produced in the interior, while just 32% is red, produced mainly along the coast. Rosé is relatively rare. Sparkling wines (pjenušavo vino or pjenušac) are also produced. I confessed to him that I preferred white wines over red. In that case he recommended that I try popular whites like Grasevina, Malvazia or Muscat.\n\nIn Croatia, Grasevina is the most planted white grape. It is grown in all the inland wine regions, particularly in Kutjevo municipality, Slavonia and around Ilok, in the far east of the country.\n\nThe best Grasevina comes from Kutjevo areas, though in the dry and hot years exceptional quality Grasevina can also be found in north-western Croatia, displaying aromas and flavors of fresh juicy apples. Grasevina, ripens late; around the second half of October. The mature Grasevina predominates yellow tones. It is clear and produces attractive citrus over the nose, mixed with glimpses of peach and bits of pineapple and is known to be a great food wine.\n\nWhereas Malvazia wine originating from the Istrian region of picturesque Brtonigla is described by connoisseurs as a full, rounded and harmonious wine of a specific flavour reminiscent of the smell of acacia flowers, with a hint of bitter almond. It pairs wonderfully with a seafood or pasta dinner. Mostly made from white grapes; there are as many as 30 different variations of Malvasia, many of which can be sampled in Istria or at wine festivals.\n\nMuscat, another white wine is commonly produced from white grapes, best grown near Buje. Its aroma is delicate and floral and the taste is full and rounded. Often produced as dry or sweet, Istrian Muscat can also be enjoyed as a dessert wine.\n\nThere is no shortage of wine producers in Istria and it is easy to sample all of them even if we did not have enough time to physically visit these award-winning wineries.\n\nCroatia is also home to the Slavonian oak forest, producing the oak casks favoured by many winemakers in Europe for aging their finest wines.\n\nHe proceeded to tell me about Kozlovic, Canavia and Zlatna but I had to stop him because though I was enjoying this conversation, by now the God of sleep was beckoning to me to surrender. Laku noc!(Good night)\n\nBesides sailing Dominik seemed very knowledgeable about Croatian wines. All the information that he gave me would surely help to make a choice the next time I was ordering wine.\n\nNext day before leaving for the next port our Captain treated us to a breathtaking courtesy round of the walled city by the boat offering all passengers a glass of Pošip each which we enjoyed on the sun deck.\n\nView of the Walled city of Dubrovnik from Sea Gull\n\nIn the next port, Trestenik Island the crew on the boat invited all the passengers to an evening called the Captain’s Dinner. That evening all the sailors including the Captain entertained us by singing, playing live music and dancing. The crew offered us a Burgundy Sparkling wine called Vuglec Breg, Pjenušavo vino Crveno (2010, Brut). The Captain began the evening by raising a toast to safe voyages. Unlike Rosé Champagne this aperitif was a Sparkling wine of dark red variety.\n\nSparkling Red Wine\n\nThe best though was yet to come. We were served a gala four course dinner. The Captain sought permission to sit at our table. We were over the moon. Dinner began with fish soup relished by many but we felt that it was a tad bland. The octopus salad was delicious and fresh. Next all passengers were served the exquisite Riba na gradele I blitva which is mixed grilled whole fish prepared on wood fire, seasoned with garlic, parsley and olive oil. The freshness of the fish and its subtle flavour could be tasted with every bite.\n\nOctopus Salad\n\nRiba na gradele I blitva\n\nOne of the sailors, Rade, was coaching a honeymooning couple on my table how to sweep the flesh off the fish in the opposite direction from its spine to achieve boneless bites. There was always loads of bread variety.\n\nThe crew continued to entertain us by playing pranks on each other. Only after much waiting, a plate of salad leaves and many jokes later they served the Captain the fish.\n\nThere was one sailor who fancied one of my girlfriends. Personal information about him was disclosed to all the passengers via an announcement. They were hilarious, played the guitar superbly and had divine fingers when it came to cooking. The fish though the main star of the dinner, the dessert that followed was also marvelous. The traditional Samoborska kremsnita or the Samobor cream cake was unique in sight and taste. At first its puff pastry top and huge size mostly containing custard cream looked difficult to eat after a huge meal. But one helping and you realize the light filling inside makes eating the cake easy and highly enjoyable.\n\nSamoborska kremsnita\n\nThe Captain at our Table\n\nNext day after breakfast we moved on to the upper deck to enjoy the amazing views of the islands sailing by and found complete peace just sitting and staring at the water as the ship sailed.\n\nAt lunch time we started to work out plans for our next stop, Korčula Island. Should we do the wine tasting tour? Dominik’s conversation the other night was like a crash course on wines and had left me enlightened. I knew what to order to drink and could also offer options to my girlfriends. We decided to give up the wine tasting idea and just walk around and make spontaneous choices.\n\nOtherwise Korčula, the birthplace of Marco Polo, was a little island easily covered on foot in few hours. While Mr Polo moved on to travel the world, he left behind a gorgeous historical hometown that its people converted into a unique place to hang out and eat.\n\nKorčula\n\nAn unplanned stroll took us to a turret on the Town Wall with a bar called Massimo on top overlooking the sea. Massimo bar has a magnificent outdoor seating on top of the turret accessible only by a steep ladder! Enjoying great views and large boats from its terrace while sipping the local wine Pošip, Ah! Sweet dreams are made of these!\n\nMassimo bar\n\nPošip Wine\n\nAround sunset we headed to a konoba and ate a plate of mussels each, made in the local buzzara style which is mussels in a sauce of fresh tomatoes, olive oil, bread crumbs and garlic. Dominik had recommended a dessert wine for us to try but we could not locate it on the menu. The chef and restaurant owner very kindly offered us a dessert wine which he had made himself and gave us a complimentary taste of fresh smoked mussels.\n\nMussels Buzzara\n\nAfter continuous sailing and visiting the glamorous and compact islands of Hvar, Bol, Brac we finally docked in Split and were feeling utterly grateful to the generosity and kindness of the Croatian people. I was falling in love with Croatia by falling in love with its wine and cuisine. My sincere apologies to its breathtaking sceneries, charming tradition and way of life of its people.\n\nStari Grad Old Town, Hvar Island\n\nAll good things as they say must come to an end and attached though we had become to the crew and other passengers of Sea Gull we had to bid them goodbye at the end of eight days. As a parting gift Dominik gave me a bottle of homemade Orahovac.\n\nOne of things to get over sadness we agreed was to be on the move than to just sit around and brood. We immediately dropped our bags at the apartment, headed to the Split bus station, got ourselves tickets to the town of Zadar and booked our Game of thrones tour for a day in Split.\n\nDue to consecutive late nights and missing Sea Gull we fell asleep on the three hour bus ride to Zadar. Zadar city is very popular with young people for its easy going reputation and numerous party places. Its by lanes are filled with numerous konobas and cafes.\n\nNot being in a cheerful mood though we arrived at lunchtime we settled for some soup and bread at Konoba Stomorica. Arlene ordered the Manestra juha or soup which is a vegetable stew typical to the Istria region made with corn and vegetables and by the friendly steward’s recommendation asked for meat to be added to it. It doubled up as main course. I chose a cream of Zagorska juha with porcini mushrooms, bell pepper and bacon bits and Mel a cream of tomato which with rice in it. All of this came with a lot of freshly baked bread like Francuski baton or French sticks, bio Kruh or wholemeal bread and kukuruzni Kruh or corn bread. Even in its simplest form Croatian food was not one to disappoint. The bread varieties could be freshly acquired from a bakery or pekara. In fact pekaras also sell traditional Balkan pastries like Burek filled with mincemeat or cheese, zeljanica filled with spinach or krumpirusa filled with potatoes.\n\nAbove all, the one thing that the steward recommended as a must try before we left Zadar was an all-time favourite drink of Napoleon called the Maraschino. The local cherry liqueur was sweet and strong with the scent of the Maraschino Cherry and gave us the required warmth on a windy afternoon.\n\nMaraschino Cherry Liquer\n\nIn 1768, a young Istrian scientist, Francesco Drioli came to Zadar and founded a liqueur company for the distillation of sour cherry maraska to perfect purity and aroma. In 1803 Drioli factory received the special Coat of Arms garnished by an imperial eagle and became the official liqueur supplier of reigning European courts. From then on, Maraschino became a worldly known product associated with royalty.\n\nThe Forum, Zadar\n\nLike other Dalmatian islands we managed to walk around and see Zadar in a few hours. For some reason we were just not up to a sit down dinner and chose to pick up some traditional Croatian snacks like pljeskavica (large, flat mince patty), cevapi ( rissoles of mince beef ,pork or lamb ) and raznijici (Croatian version of shish kebab) all fresh from a pekara. We avoided the lepinja or flat bread served with the snacks. We bought a bottle of Maraschino to share and sat ourselves at a place where we could watch the sunset, hear the melodious man made Sea Organ (a large set of steps made in such a way that it plays music automatically with every move of the sea waves )and watch the lights that illuminated and appeared like disco lights on the Greetings to the Sun after it became dark and reminisced our time spent in Croatia and Sea Gull.\n\nGreetings to the Sun , Zadar ( day view)\n\nThe Sea Organ, Zadar\n\nWe returned to Split by the night bus and slept in our comfortable apartment till lunch time next day. We left this day for relaxation and shopping and bought a bottle of Maraschino, Orahovac, Zigante truffles and fresh fig jam, all to bring home.\n\nTomorrow was our last day here and we were looking forward to the Game of thrones tour.\n\nIn the morning we were ready to tread on Daenereys’ footsteps in the kingdom of Mereen that Split transforms to in the TV series. As per instructions given, we met the English speaking guide at four fifteen pm and began the tour at the south entrance of the Diocletian palace and saw the palace basement, water mill and the Žrnovnica quarry which were all filming locations of the Game of thrones series and ended our tour at the Kliss fortress with dinner.\n\nIt was a complete Game of thrones ambience with traditional torch light Peka dinner, guarded by Daenereys (or a guide that resembled her) and a dragon. Our meal was called lamb peka or literally lamb under the bell. A peka is a large metal dish with a lid shaped like a bell or a dome used to cook food in an open fire place. In some places it is common to see locals openly cook on the streets to tempt tourists.\n\nHot coals and embers are put on the dome to slowly and evenly cook meat, poultry,eggs,fish and vegetables and the final ,succulently cooked dish is also called the Peka. Our meal was accompanied by Vina Laguna Chardonnay wine, water and lots of bread. We instantly fell in love with our sumptuous, top notch dinner which would be hard to forget.\n\nLamb Peka\n\nWhat an end to a most rewarding tour. We regret not having more leave days to visit other Croatian towns like Istria. Hopefully the amount of Istrian wines we drank compensated for it.\n\nThey say sometimes people come into your life for a reason. Today though I am not in touch with Marc I feel he came into my life only to introduce me to this gem of a place called Croatia. Hvala (thank you) Marc and Zivjeli (cheers) to that. Croatia showed us a good time.\n\n."
