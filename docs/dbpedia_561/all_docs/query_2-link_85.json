        "text": "Report on the Situation of Albanian-language Education in Kosova\n\nThe letter was signed August 12 1997 by Abdyl Ramaj, Secretary of the Commission for\n\nEducation of LDK, and Head of Parliamentary Commission for Education, Science, Culture\n\nand Sports of Kosova. It was sent to Federico Mayor UNESCO General Director, as well\n\nas to several embassies in Belgrade.\n\nText: THE SITUATION IN ALBANIAN EDUCATION IN KOSOVA AND\n\nPOSSIBILITIES FOR ITS TEMPORARY NORMALIZATION\n\nUnder the Constitution of Kosova and pursunat to appropriate laws provisions, Kosova\n\nhad full independence in regulating the education, science and culture, just like the other\n\nrepublics of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nFollowing the forceful annexation of Kosova and the suspension of its legitimate\n\ninstitutions, the Serbian regime suspended all the Kosova institutions related to education.\n\nIt should be noted that the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Kosova\n\n(Secretariat of Education, Science and Culture of Kosova) as the highest organ, as well as\n\nother educational institutions, administered and maintained independently the entire\n\neducational, cultural and scientific life in Kosova. As a result, the educational authorities of\n\nKosova were fully independent to compile and approve the curricula, to decide about the\n\nnetwork of schools, and to control the whole educational system of Kosova. Before the\n\nSerb crack-down on Kosova, Albanian-language and Serb-language education functioned\n\nas paralel mediums of educationn in Kosova.\n\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN KOSOVA\n\nThe destruction of educational system of Kosova has been lasting process, yet it\n\nintensified after 1981 with systametic persecution of students and teachers, the so-called\n\n\"political [communist] differentiation\" or complete dismissal of teachers, annulment of\n\nKosova legislation on education, science and culture and introduction of Serb laws\n\ninstead, segregation through dividing Albanian and Serb schoolchildren into different\n\nschool buildings, etc. However, the process of destruction of Kosova education escalated\n\nin 1990. In spring of that year, deliberate intoxication of around 7.400 Albanian\n\nschoolchildren occurred in schools, while only a few months later, in autumn, the regime\n\nbegan with the closure of secondary schools. By the end of 1990, the Serbian Parliament\n\ndecided that one half of secondary schools in Kosova be closed down, while in April of\n\n1991 the Serb Parliament decided that only 28 per cent of pupils who were expected to\n\ncomplete their primary education that year in Kosova could resume with their secondary\n\neducation. On force Serbia locked down school buildings of primary and secondary\n\neducation and the University of Prishtina. As a result 396 full-class [from 1st to 8th grade]\n\nprimary schools, 454 four-year and annex primary schools, 56 secondary schools, 7\n\nteachers training and engineering colleges, and 13 faculties were closed down that year.\n\nAround 14.500 primary and 4.000 secondary school and 862 University teachers were\n\ndismissed. Owing to international pressure Serbia was forced to re-open most of the\n\nprimary schools in the meantime. Yet, schoolchildren of 41 elementary schools have not\n\nbeen allowed to attend classes in their school ever since. The pupils of 11 such schools\n\nhave been sents to attend classes in other primary schools of the community, while those\n\nof 26 others attend classes in make-shift classrooms in private houses. There are today\n\n441 full elementary primary schools (pupils of 41 are not allowed access to school\n\nbuildings) with a total of 266.413 pupils and 13.585 teachers and other education-related\n\npersonnel in Kosova.\n\nOut of 66 secondary schools operating today in Kosova, students of 6 of them only are\n\nallowed access to their school buildings. All the rest attend classes in inadequate\n\nmakeshift classrooms in private houses and other buildings of community. Albanian\n\nsecondary school students are also denied access to their facilities: school libraries,\n\ndormitories, sport halls (gyms) etc. As many as 58.700 students attend secondary school\n\neducation, with a teaching staff of 4.310.\n\nMore or less the situation is the same at the University of Prishtina. It has been six\n\nyears now since Albanian students were expelled from 7 high schools (colleges) and 13\n\nfaculties. Besides the lecturing halls, Albanian students are denied access to the\n\nUniversity Library, the libraries in faculties and departments, dormitories, dinning halls and\n\ncanteens, sports halls (gyms) etc. In the 1996/97 academic year, there were around\n\n16.000 students (both full-time and part-time) studying at the Albanian-medium University\n\nof Prishtina in make-shift classrooms and halls. The University teaching personnel is made\n\nof 826 full-time teachers and 200 part-time and associate teachers.\n\nFollowing is the list primary schools in which Albanian schoolchildren are denied access to but are forced to either attend classes in make-shift classrooms or have bee sent to other schools where access for the Albanian has been allowed:\n\n(Note: The names of municipalities (towns) are both in Albanian and Serbian.

The University of Prishtina has shared the fate of primary and secondary schools in\n\nKosova. Attacks at the Kosovar higher education began with the imposition of the so-\n\ncalled emergency measures (coercive administration) at the Clinic of Gynecology and\n\nObstetrics of the Medical Faculty. All the Albanian-language personnel and other staff\n\nwere suspended. The Department of Surgery was to face the same measures very soon.\n\n2. Emergency measures were introduced at the Medical Faculty (Official gazette 20/90;\n\n26.09 1990). 90 per cent of the Albanian personnel (from academicians to nurses) were\n\ndismissed. The Medical Faculty was in this way virtually closed down.\n\n3. The Serbian regime extended a new law on students enrolment for the 1991/92\n\nacademic year (Official Gazette No.28/91; 31.05.1991). According to new legislation, the\n\nenrolment ratio was to be 1:1 for Serbs and Albanians (1500 Albanian and 1500 Serb\n\nfreshmen). Albanians who had completed the secondary education thast year\n\noutnumbered the Serbs with 9 to 1.\n\n4. On 27 June 1991, emergency measures were introduced in all the faculties of the\n\nPrishtina University. All the Albanian administering personnel, deans, vice-deans, and\n\nothers were ousted and Serbs were installed instead. A University teaching staff of 862\n\nwas dismissed soon, while 122 teachers and other personnel were dismissed on alleged\n\nredundancy reasons.\n\n5. On 16 October 1991, the University of Prishtina was closed for Albanian students. Serb\n\npolice were deployed in front of the faculties and other accessory buildings of the\n\nUniversity. The University of Prishtina, with 7 high schools (teachers and technical training\n\ncolleges) and 13 faculties has been ever since operating in make-shift classrooms and\n\nlecturing halls in private houses and other facilities of the community. (During the last\n\n1996/97 academic year the Albanian-medium University had around 16.000 students, full-\n\ntime and part-time).\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS OF THE PRISHTINA UNIVERSITY:\n\n(Note: A High School is a two-year university-level college.

The Television of Prishtina\n\nPremises and facilities related to education were closed and/and taken over by Serbs:\n\n1. Premises of the Secretariat of Education, Science and Culture of Kosova\n\n2. Premises of the Council of Education of Kosova,\n\n3. Premises of Bureau of Education of Kosova.\n\n4. Premises of the Pedagogical Bureau of Kosova\n\n5. Premises of local bureaus of education in municipalities\n\n6. Premises of municipal secretariats of education\n\nThe following (major) sports facilities have been closed down:\n\nGjakova, Peja.\n\nThe only Children's Books Publisher is Closed Down\n\nPursuant to the decision no.203 of 11 July 1991 of the Serbian Parliament, emergency\n\nmeasures were imposed at the only children's book publisher in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe whole personnel of the Bureau for Textbook Publishers of Kosova was dismissed.\n\nFor five years now this textbook publishers company has been closed pursuant to Serb\n\nlaws.\n\nIn the beginning the primary spelling book (Abecedarium) was printed in Italy. It had to be\n\nsmuggled in the country in exceptionally dangerous circumstances. A limited number of\n\ntextbooks in Albanian for schoolchildren is being printed now in extremely grave\n\nconditions.\n\n1. Pursuant to decisions No.400 - 20/91 and 400/15/91 of 20 February 1991 of the Serb\n\nParliament, since January 1991, all the Albanians teaching with the 1st and 5th grade of\n\nprimary schools and 1st year of secondary schools had their wages cut.\n\n2. Pursuant to Decision No.400-41/91 of 7 March 1991, the whole secondary school\n\nteaching personnel in Albanian (around 5000 people) had their payment cut. .\n\n3. Pursuant to Decision No.400-137/91 of 30 May 1991, the rest of the primary school\n\nteaching personnel (around 14.500 persons) had their wages/salaries cut.\n\n4. Pursuant to Decision No. 400-211/91 of 18 November 1991, the funds for higher\n\neducation of Kosova were cut.\n\nWhat could be the measures for temporary normalization of the situation in Kosovar\n\neducation\n\nFull normalization of the situation in Kosova education could only occur with the settlement\n\nof the political status of Kosova. The current situation could be overcome if the issue is\n\ntreated as pure educational matter, by circumventing or reducing political implications\n\naround it.\n\nWithin such a framework, 13 rounds of talks were held under the Geneva Conference with\n\nthe mediation of Ambassador Gert Ahrens. Later, under the mediation of the Vatican-\n\nbased Saint Egidio Community, an agreement was reached which provided for conditions\n\nto removed the blockade from school premise and for an unconditional return of Albanian\n\nschoolchildren and pupils to their schools. An Accord on this matter was signed by\n\npresidents Dr. Ibrahim Rugova and Slobodan Milosevic. Regrettably, the Accord was\n\nnever implemented to this day.\n\nWe hope you will wield your influence in finding an acceptable settlement so that Albanian\n\npupils, students and teachers are allowed to return to their school facilities they were\n\nexpelled from through the use of force. A temporary solution should be to the issues\n\nwithout prejudging the settlement of the political status of Kosova. Negotiations on such a\n\ngoal could at last result in the following:\n\nI\n\n1. To bring to an end all repression against Albania school, pupils, students, teachers and\n\nother people involved in running Albanian-language education.\n\n2. To allow Albanians access to education-related facilities, the ones they were in\n\npossession of earlier:\n\na) to immediately release the buildings of 35 primary schools and their 'annex' classes.\n\nb) To release all the school buildings of secondary education the Albanians were expelled\n\nfrom, i.e. premises of 60 secondary schools and their accessory facilities: dormitories,\n\nlibraries, sports halls (gyms), etc.\n\nc) To release university premises in 7 high schools (teachers training and engineering\n\ncolleges) and 13 faculties, as well as their accessory facilities: the University and National\n\nLibrary, the institutes, dormitories, dinning halls and canteens, sports halls, etc.\n\nII\n\nTEMPORARY NORMALIZATION OF FINANCING THE EDUCATION\n\nA normalization of the financing the Kosova education could only be reached with a final\n\nsettlement of the Kosova issue. However, a temporary solution to the matter could be\n\nfound through: the taxes collected from the citizens and the contribution Kosovars have\n\nbeen paying, and their share in socially-owned production. An adequate fund could be\n\nearmarked for the Kosova Financing Council.\n\nIII\n\nRestoration of normality in the Kosova Textbook Publishers Bureau by releasing its\n\npremises and the capital the Bureau used to possess.\n\nIV\n\nTo allow a normal functioning of administering, professional and training institutions of\n\neducation: the Pedagogical Bureau of Kosova, municipal educational councils,\n\npedagogical and supervision services, etc.\n\nPrishtina, 12 August, 1997."
