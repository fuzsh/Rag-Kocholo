        "text": "Situated at the crossroads between Central and Southeast Europe, Croatia has a picturesque Adriatic coastline, historic towns, and a rich cultural heritage.\n\nLike its geographical tapestry, Croatian cuisine is a delightful blend of Mediterranean and Central European influences. It boasts a rich variety of dishes, often incorporating fresh seafood, meats, and hearty vegetables.\n\nDrinking customs in Croatia are rooted deeply in social and cultural settings. Whether it’s a family gathering, a festive celebration, or a simple meeting with friends, beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, play an essential role.\n\nSo, let’s discover some of the most popular Croatian drinks!\n\nTypes of Drinks in Croatia\n\nThe Croatian national drinks include wine, rakija (fruit spirits and liqueurs), beer, coffee, and some unique soft drinks.\n\nCroatia has a rich wine-making history and is known for its quality wines. The most famous Croatian wine regions include Istria and Kvarner, Dalmatia, Slavonija and Danube, and Croatian Uplands. Popular types of wine produced in Croatia include Plavac Mali, Malvazija, and Graševina.\n\nRakija is a versatile fruit spirit commonly made from grapes (komovica and loza) and other fruits, such as plum (sljivovica), pear (vilijamovka), and cherries (maraschino). Additionally, various herbs and fruits, with or without added sugar, can be infused in rakija, leading to liqueurs like honey, mistletoe, herbal, and green walnuts.\n\nBeer is also a popular drink in Croatia, with the most well-known brands being Ožujsko and Karlovacko. However, in the last decade, the craft beer scene has exploded in Croatia, creating countless exciting beer labels and styles, such as IPA, porter, and sour beers.\n\nCoffee is a big part of Croatian culture regarding non-alcoholic beverages. Coffee drinking in Croatia is a ritual that often involves sitting for hours and socializing with friends and family. At home, Croatians mainly consume “Turkish-style” or “Bosnian-style” coffee, which involves boiling fine-ground coffee in a pot with water and sugar.\n\nAdditionally, Croatia has some unique soft drinks popular among locals and tourists. Some of the most well-known ones include Cedevita (a vitamin C supplement drink), Pasareta (a red-colored soda), and Pipi (a lemonade-like soda).\n\nCroatian Alcohol\n\nCroatia boasts a rich tradition of alcoholic beverages, many of which are integral to its cultural heritage.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the WHO in 2019, Croatians consume 8.7 liters of alcohol per capita annually, which is below the EU average. However, experts note Croats drink at least 25 percent more when “domestic production” is included, which is not easy to quantify.\n\nThe most popular alcoholic drinks in Croatia are wine, brandies and liqueurs (rakija), and beer.\n\nRakija is a strong fruit brandy, deeply ingrained in Croatian culture and cuisine. It is typically served as a digestif after meals or offered as a welcoming drink to guests. Some of the most popular types of rakija are šljivovica (plum brandy) and lozovača (grape brandy).\n\nMany Croatian liqueurs are based on rakija infused with various fruits, herbs, and spices. Only a few liqueurs use neutral spirits, such as Maraschino (made from cherries). Some of the most famous ones include Orahovac (walnuts), Medovaca (honey), and Travarica (herbs).\n\nCroatian wine has a storied past, with production dating back to Greek and Roman times. The country’s diverse climate and terrain contribute to various wine styles, from the crisp white wines of Istria to the robust reds of Dalmatia and the delicate sparkling wines of the Croatian Uplands.\n\nCroatia’s beer consumption is also significant, and the country has a thriving beer scene. According to the Brewers of Europe website, Croatians consume 79 liters of beer per capita annually. Ožujsko and Karlovačko are two of the most recognized brands. The craft beer movement has further enriched the beer landscape, with local breweries like Garden Brewery and Zmajska Pivovara leading the way.\n\nCroatian Brandy (Rakija)\n\nRakija (brandy) is considered a Croatian national drink. Most Croatian brandies are made from grapes (lozovača/komovica), plums (šljivovica), but other fruits like pears (viljamovka), or apples (jabukovaca) are used too.\n\nCroatian brandy is traditionally distilled in copper stills. The process starts by fermenting fruits like grapes, plums, pears, and apples. The fermented mash is then heated, vaporizing the alcohol, which is subsequently cooled and condensed into a liquid. This yields a raw spirit that captures the essence of the fruit.\n\nRakija can be aged in oak barrels for added flavors like vanilla and spice or bottled young for a vibrant, fruity taste. Typically, rakija’s alcohol content is around 40%, though homemade versions can be even stronger.\n\nCroatian brandies offer diverse aromas, a clean, clear appearance, and a well-rounded, harmonious taste.\n\nRakija is often served neat (without ice) in small glasses as a digestif after meals, but can also be enjoyed independently or paired with dried fruits or nuts.\n\nCroatian Liqueurs\n\nCroatian liqueurs are very popular in Croatia, embodying a rich tradition of flavor and craftsmanship. They mainly use fruit brandy (rakija) as their base, though some also use neutral alcohol, like Maraschino and Pelinkovac.\n\nAmong the most popular are Pelinkovac, Maraschino, and Teranino. Pelinkovac is a bitter herbal liqueur, typically crafted from wormwood and other aromatic herbs, with an alcohol content of around 28-35%. It is enjoyed both as an aperitif and a digestif. Maraschino, made from the Marasca cherries grown in the Dalmatian region, boasts a sweet, complex profile with notes of cherry and almond. Its alcohol content is typically around 32%. Teranino, derived from the Teran grape, offers a smooth and sweet taste profile and excels in cocktails and straight sipping.\n\nIn addition to these well-known varieties, Croatia produces a myriad of liqueurs made from fruit alcohol bases, such as Medovača (honey liqueur), Rogač (carob liqueur), Mirta (myrtle liqueur), Smokva (fig liqueur), Orahovac (walnut liqueur), and Višnjevača (sour cherry liqueur). These liqueurs typically have an alcohol content of 20% to 40%, each offering a distinct flavor profile ranging from bitter to sweet.\n\nCroatian Wines\n\nCroatia boasts a rich winemaking tradition that stretches back to Greek and Roman times, making it one of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world.\n\nThe key wine regions in Croatia include Istria and Kvarner, Dalmatia, and the two inland regions: Slavonia and the Croatian Uplands.\n\nCroatia’s two most popular wines are Malvazija Istarska (white wine) and Plavac Mali (red wine), which come from Istria and Dalmatia. Other notable Croatian wine varietals include the indigenous Grk and Pošip from the island of Korčula, known for their full-bodied and aromatic white wines. Graševina (Welschriesling), from the Slavonia region, is highly regarded for its light and fruity characteristics, making it one of Croatia’s most popular wines.\n\nSome of Croatia’s top-quality winemakers include Saints Hills, Milos, Rizman, Kozlovic, Benvenuti, Damjanic, Krauthaker, and Tomac.\n\nCroatian Beers\n\nCroatia’s beer scene is as vibrant and diverse as its wine and spirits offerings. The beer market here is dominated by well-known brands such as Ožujsko, Karlovačko, and Pan.\n\nIn recent years, the Croatian beer landscape has experienced an exciting influx of craft beers. Craft breweries like The Garden Brewery, Medvedgrad Brewery, Varionica, Zmajska Pivovara, and Nova Runda are revolutionizing the market with innovative brews and creative approaches.\n\nCroatian Soft Drinks\n\nSeveral popular Croatian soft drinks are worth noting. Pipi, an orange-flavored soda, evokes a nostalgic taste of childhood for many Croatians. Pasareta, a non-alcoholic drink from Istria, is known for its unique blend of herbs and natural ingredients.\n\nCedevita is a vitamin-rich powdered drink mixed with water to create a refreshing, effervescent beverage. Available in various flavors, such as orange, lemon, and grapefruit, Cedevita is widely enjoyed across Croatia, particularly by children!\n\nCockta, a beloved Slovenian soft drink, is also popular in Croatia. Its unique flavor profile combines herbal extracts, fruit essences, and caramel, providing a regional alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nAnother refreshing option is sok od bazge, an elderflower syrup often diluted with water to create a light, fragrant beverage. This traditional Croatian drink is cherished for its floral notes and is especially popular during the warmer months.\n\nHot Beverages in Croatia\n\nRegarding hot beverages in Croatia, coffee undeniably takes the lead as the most popular choice. The country enjoys a vibrant coffee culture, where sipping freshly brewed coffee in local cafés is not merely a caffeine fix but a cherished daily ritual. Croatians favor espresso-based drinks, with the traditional bijela kava (white coffee) and macchiato commonly enjoyed in the mornings and afternoons. Social interactions are often centered around coffee, making it integral to Croatian daily life.\n\nAlthough tea is not traditionally a dominant beverage in Croatia, there has been a noticeable shift in recent years. More Croatians are discovering the health benefits and calming rituals associated with green and black teas. While coffee maintains its stronghold, awareness and appreciation for quality teas are rising.\n\nIn many Croatian cafés, infusions and herbal teas are widely available, with hibiscus, chamomile, and mint (mentha) being particularly popular choices.\n\nCroatians strongly believe in the healing benefits of herbal teas. Sage tea is widely used to treat mouth, gum, and throat infections, while laurel tea is favored for alleviating dry coughs.\n\nHibiscus tea is known for boosting immunity, chamomile is revered for aiding digestion, and uva ursi is commonly used for bladder issues.\n\nAmong the main Croatian coffee brands are Franck, a local favorite, and Barcaffè. Franck also offers a variety of tea options. The Ciglica coffee (250g, vacuum-packed Franck coffee) is an iconic product that holds a special place in Croatian culture. It’s a common gift when visiting someone’s home or expressing gratitude, often accompanied by Domacica cookies.\n\n13 Popular Croatian Drinks\n\nBelow is a list of 13 popular Croatian drinks, including traditional spirits, wine, refreshing non-alcoholic drinks, and coffee.\n\n1. Rakija (Brandies and Liqueurs)\n\nRakija is a fruit spirit typically made from grapes, and other fruits like apples (jabukovaca), pears (vilijamovka), or plums (sljivovica).\n\nOther fruits and plants, with or without sugar, can be covered with rakija and left in the sun for several months, creating various liqueurs.\n\nThe most popular liqueurs include medovaca (honey liqueur), teranino (red wine liqueur), orahovac (green walnuts liqueur), biska (mistletoe liqueur), travarica (herbal liqueur), mirta (myrtile liqueur). But the combinations are countless, including our favorite liqueurs made of roses (ruzovaca), sour cherry (visnjevaca), and carob (rogac).\n\nOther popular liqueurs in Croatia include pelinkovac (a bitter liqueur based on wormwood) and maraschino (a sweet liqueur made of Maraschino cherries).\n\nThese potent drinks are often enjoyed as a digestif after meals. Many restaurants offer a free shot at the end of the meal.\n\nIn Croatia, brandy is celebrated not only as a popular alcoholic beverage and digestif but also for its reputed medicinal benefits.\n\nCroatians will readily offer you green walnut brandy if you have stomach issues. For back or neck pain, a simple massage with brandy on the affected area is recommended to lower a high fever. Sore throats and toothaches are believed to be eased more effectively with brandy than conventional pills. Clearly, the Croatians place great trust in the healing powers of brandy.\n\nRakija makes a great souvenir from Croatia to bring home. It comes in various bottle sizes, including small bottles of 0.1 l. Popular brands include Aura, Badel, and Maraska, which are easily available in shops throughout Croatia.\n\n2. Vino (Wine)\n\nCroatian wine, known locally as “vino,” has a rich history of over 2,000 years. Its heritage intertwines with the ancient Greeks and Romans.\n\nCroatia has four distinct wine regions: Slavonia and Croatian Danube, Croatian Uplands, Istria and Kvarner, and Dalmatia. Each region offers unique terroirs that reflect the flavor profiles of the wines.\n\nIstria and Kvarner are famed for Malvazija Istarska, a white wine known for its aromatic qualities and crisp acidity. Teran is another standout from this region, a robust red wine with a deep ruby color and intense fruity flavors.\n\nMoving to Dalmatia, visitors will find the celebrated Plavac Mali, a descendant of the Croatian indigenous sort Tribidrag, better known today as Zinfandel.

Sljivovica (Slivovitz, Plum Brandy)\n\nSljivovica, also known as slivovitz or plum brandy, is a potent and cherished Croatian distilled spirit made from plums. This traditional Croatian drink, popular across the Balkan peninsula, boasts a long history and cultural significance, particularly in rural areas with abundant plum orchards. The name “sljivovica” is derived from the Croatian word for plum, “šljiva,” reflecting its primary ingredient.\n\nThe production process of Slivovitz begins with harvesting fully ripened plums, typically in late September. The plums are then cleaned, pitted, and mashed to create a pulp, which is left to ferment naturally.\n\nDuring fermentation, yeasts convert the sugars in the plum mash into alcohol, creating a thick, fragrant mixture. The fermented pulp is then distilled, usually in copper pot stills, to extract and concentrate the alcohol.\n\nThis distillation process may be repeated several times to achieve the desired alcohol content and flavor profile. The resulting liquid is then aged in wooden barrels, often made from oak, which imparts additional depth and complexity to the brandy.\n\nSljivovica is most commonly associated with Croatia’s Slavonia and Baranja regions, where the climate and soil conditions are perfect for growing high-quality plums. Croatia also has a strong tradition of homemade slivovitz, or “domaća rakija,” with many families passing down their secret recipes through generations. Sljivovica is often enjoyed during cultural events, family gatherings, and festive celebrations.\n\nSljivovica can be purchased in liquor shops and supermarkets across Croatia, as well as specialty stores and online retailers that cater to international customers.\n\nAmong the best-known Croatian brands of Slivovitz are Badel, Maraska, and craft distillery Wise Grus.

It is also enjoyed as an aperitif or digestif, pairing well with savory appetizers or desserts.\n\nAdditionally, many international bartenders and mixologists have incorporated it into their drinks menus in recent years, creating a unique and refreshing twist on classic cocktails such as Cosmopolitan and Margarita.\n\nIn Croatia, Sljivovica is not just a drink but also a symbol of tradition, culture, and hospitality. It is deeply ingrained in the country’s history and heritage, making it an essential part of Croatian identity.\n\n6. Viljamovka (Pear Brandy)\n\nViljamovka, also known as Croatian pear brandy, is a popular spirit made from Williams pears, a variety known for its juicy and flavorful profile. This exquisite drink hails from continental Croatia’s fertile and temperate regions, particularly Slavonia and Zagorje.\n\nViljamovka’s production begins with carefully selecting high-quality Williams pears, which are washed, crushed, and fermented to extract their rich flavors. The fermented pear mash is then distilled, often in copper pot stills, to capture the essence of the fruit.\n\nThe resulting spirit is typically aged in wooden barrels, such as oak, which adds depth and complexity to the flavor profile, or it can be left unaged for a fresher, more fruit-forward experience.\n\nDepending on personal preferences, Vilijamovka is best enjoyed neat at room temperature or chilled. It is served as an aperitif or digestif. Viljamovka can also be incorporated into cocktails for a contemporary twist.\n\nThis exceptional pear brandy is available in liquor stores, supermarkets across Croatia, and specialized shops and online retailers serving international markets.\n\nAmong the notable Croatian brands producing premium Viljamovka are Badel, Maraska, and Vertigo. Vertigo, a craft distillery, is known for its small-batch production, highlighting the unique characteristics of the pears used.\n\nVertigo’s Viljamovka won the gold medal and 95 points at the London IWSC in 2023.

They produce world-class gins that have captured the attention of connoisseurs globally.\n\nAmong these distilleries, Duh u Boci and Aura Distillery stand out as leaders in the Croatian gin movement.

You can also find this traditional dessert wine in restaurants, wineries, and even local markets nationwide.\n\nThere is a controversy surrounding Prosek wine due to disputes over its naming rights within the European Union. Although historical records indicate that the name “Prosek” was in use long before the introduction of the Italian sparkling wine prosecco, Italian prosecco producers have prohibited Croatians from using the name “Prosek” for their sweet wine.\n\nThe controversy arises from the similarity in names, even though the distinct differences between the two wines are evident.\n\nProsecco is a light and sparkling white wine, whereas Prosek is a sweet wine with an amber hue and a syrupy texture. These differences cater to different palates and occasions, reducing the likelihood of consumer confusion.\n\nThe dispute remains unresolved, and Croatians hope the European Union will rule in their favor and allow them to use the name “Prosek” for their traditional dessert wine.\n\n10.
