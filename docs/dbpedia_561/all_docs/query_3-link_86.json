        "text": "Montenegro – The Country You Need to Prepare For\n\nMontenegro (in local – Crna Gora) is one of the few countries in Europe that continues to leave tourists with a lot of diametrically opposite impressions. Some go with the words: “What an awesome place. I’ll be back next year for sure.” Others leave Montenegro with a confusing: “What was that all about?!”.\n\nAnd interestingly, this is by no means a story about “how many people, so many opinions.” This is a story about being useful to look at some decent guide to Montenegro before buying tickets. Find out if you need it. And if so, what exactly. For example, I liked the first two-week trip around Montenegro that I planned. And at the same time, I realized what kind of vacation here I personally would not like.\n\nOPINION\n\nMontenegro just requires a good user manual.\n\nHope that mine will work well for you.\n\nAnd for a good start, I propose to fly a drone along the coast of Montenegro, from Petrovac to Tivat. Feel if you like these places at first sight. Looks best in 4K. So let’s fly!\n\nThis guide to Montenegro is detailed and voluminous. Very. If you were looking for something habitually short and superficial, this is not it. I tried not to make this long read dull. Did it work – you can write in the comments.\n\nIn order not to get lost, use the main table of contents. By clicking on the link in it, you can immediately go to the desired section. The big sections have their own table of contents. Using the “Back to top” button, you can go back to the main table of contents.\n\nBriefly about Montenegro\n\nThe flag. Here it is.\n\nYear of foundation: 2006 (as a modern sovereign state). In the past, Montenegro was one of the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Separated peacefully and did not fight with the Serbs.\n\nArea: 13,812 sq. km (5,333 sq. miles). It’s 5 times less than Florida or the Czech Republic.\n\nGeographical position: the western part of the Balkan Peninsula, on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. The opposite is Italy.\n\nCapital: Podgorica. This is not a resort, and there are no really unique attractions here. Another capital is the city of Cetinje. Yes, this is Montenegro. There are officially two capitals.\n\nTerritorial division: administrative unit – community (opština). There are 21 communities in total. The names usually coincide with the names of large cities – Budva, Bar, Herceg Novi, Kotor, etc.\n\nTime zone: Central European Time, UTC +1.\n\nLanguage: Montenegrin. Languages in official use: Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Albanian. Few locals speak English well. But many locals employed in tourism can understand and explain themselves in English, at least at the elementary level. In Podgorica, the situation with the penetration of the English language is significantly better. Many young people and some representatives of the older generation are proficient in it. Occasionally, you can expect English to be understood in a supermarket. Taxi drivers mostly understand only numbers. However, sometimes you may meet those who are quite proficient in English. For example, if you order Tesla taxi in Podgorica.\n\nPopulation. The population of Montenegro is 650 000 people. The majority are Montenegrins and Serbs. And are much fewer other nationalities. There are many expats from russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Turkey.\n\nCurrency: euro. Smart guys got their bearings on time. I recommend taking half of the estimated expenses in cash. Cards are not in favor here.\n\nWhen the season: comfortable – from mid-May to late September. High season – July, August.\n\nApartments: there is a wide range of them. Some are ok and relatively inexpensive. Ideal – mission impossible. In Montenegro, it’s not common to extensively renovate or even refresh apartments. Therefore, if a guest before you broke or damaged something, it’s typically not the owner’s problem but yours.\n\nPrices: it is not Italy, of course. But not everything is for a penny, contrary to popular belief. The reason is that the country produces nearly nothing. Consequently, it imports almost everything.\n\nDo you need a visa? The short answer – for most of the western world countries – not. Visa rules for citizens of different countries are set out on the tourist portal of Montenegro.\n\nThe national composition of tourists: representatives of the former Yugoslav republics (Serbs, Macedonians, Bosnians), russians, Ukrainians, Belarussians. The rest are quantitatively more minor, but there are tourists from almost all European countries. Very rarely you can meet tourists from the USA or Canada. Still nearly no Chinese.\n\nSecurity: quite safe. It’s not worth worrying about. In some European capitals, you can easily find more risky places. In Montenegro, in this sense, it is almost complete relaxation.\n\nConnection. Telephone code: +382. For mobile Internet, it is quite profitable to take a local SIM card.\n\nTourist portals of Montenegro: visit-montenegro.com and montenegro.travel.\n\n39 Frequently Asked Questions About Montenegro. Answered!\n\nPrologue\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that this guide, written from my personal experience, contains quite a bit of criticism. Subjectively deserved.\n\nHaving visited this Balkan country three times, I dare to assume that I found out the nature of such a wide range of emotions.\n\nSo what is the main reason for polar impressions? It’s banal. Despite the impressive amount of tourists visiting Montenegro, in 2024 it’s still not so well known to the broad masses of tourists. Many are simply too lazy to dive deeper to find out where exactly they decided to go.\n\nOPINION\n\nThere is an opinion that Montenegro is something like Egypt or Turkey, but with European service. And inexpensive. Dreams, dreams :)\n\nFor many, it turns out that Montenegro is special only upon arrival. Here you may not see what you are used to in most European countries. And, on the contrary, get a lot of what you can’t find in more pop tourist destinations.\n\nTraveling around Montenegro for me turned out to be, perhaps, one of the most unusual of all. In total, I spent about 2.5 months here as tourist. And lived even more. Can tell a lot of stories for a long time.\n\nWhat awaits you in the maze of this guide to Montenegro?\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nIt will be interesting to independent travelers who fiercely despise package tours\n\nThis will be an enchanting long read. Facts, routes, helpful tips, and much more. If you decide to go to Montenegro, then, instead of a long preparation, you can simply add this page to your favorites and use it as a guide on the spot. Before the trip, just open and read it for several days instead of scrolling social media.\n\nI know the intro was painfully long. I promise there will be less useless philosophy further. There will be more helpful travel content.\n\nMore about Montenegro\n\nWhere is Montenegro?\n\nHere it is – Montenegro on the world map.\n\nMontenegro is located in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula, on the Adriatic Sea. The area of ​​Montenegro is 13,812 km². The territory of the country is conventionally square-like. One of the sides of the “square” is the sea coast, 294 km long.\n\nIn the west (or in the north with a slope to the west) Montenegro borders Croatia. In particular, the Croatian Dubrovnik (it is also the capital of the Seven Kingdoms) is only 40 km from the Montenegrin-Croatian border. In the northwest, the country borders Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the southeast – Kosovo. And Albania is located to the south of Montenegro.\n\nOn the opposite coast, 200 km away, Italy is visible (if you look closely at Google Maps at the correct scale).\n\nThe country is small. 5 times less than the relatively small Czech Republic. But do not be mistaken. You can travel around the country in the direction of various exciting locations for a very long time. Especially considering the terrain.\n\nClimate\n\nThe geographical location of Montenegro is such that, despite its small size, there are three climatic zones.\n\nMediterranean\n\nThe most comfortable climate, the Mediterranean, is on the Adriatic coast. All the main Montenegrin resorts are located here – Budva, Becici, Petrovac, Herceg Novi, Ulcinj and others. The number of sunny days per year on the coast is 240.\n\nThe comfortable swimming season in Montenegro lasts from about mid-May to mid-September. At this time, it is warm or hot here, with minimal rainfall.\n\nWater temperature\n\nAverage water temperature on the coast of Montenegro:\n\nIt happened so that I took the earliest and latest water procedures in the northern part of the Montenegrin coast.\n\nOn May 22, I had a chance to swim on the almost empty Plavi Horizonti beach in the Tivat region. Although during the season it is one of the most densely populated beaches in Montenegro. The water temperature in May was quite normal. But when it’s windy in the late afternoon, being on the shore is no longer so comfortable.\n\nI took the latest water procedures on September 23 in the vicinity of Herceg Novi, on the Zanjice beach. The water was quite «fresh», but not too cold for swimming. Although on this beach, by default, the water temperature is slightly lower than on most of the coast.\n\nIn Montenegro, they swim in October. But both water and wind are much less conducive to swimming at this time. In addition, in October the weather in Montenegro gets worse, and the number of precipitation increases. The same problem can sometimes spoil the beginning of the season in May.\n\nTemperate continental\n\nOutside the coastal zone, the climate in Montenegro is temperate continental. The main difference from the coast is a colder winter.\n\nMountainous\n\nUnexpectedly, this type of climate is found precisely in the mountainous regions of Montenegro. It is characterized by colder winters and more snow. Not everyone is aware, but there is also winter tourism in Montenegro. And its popularity is growing year by year. The country’s two main winter resorts are Kolasin (more modern) and Zabljak.\n\nEcology\n\nThe primary industry in Montenegro is tourism. There are few industrial enterprises here. Dirty industries are even less. 8% of the country’s territory are protected areas. Moreover, Montenegro is an “ecological state” according to the Constitution.\n\nREFERENCE\n\nTourism in Montenegro is in favor. Ecology is at its best. The owners of cement plants can only move through the streets in short dashes in the dark (just kidding).\n\nBut it should be noted that good ecology in Montenegro is not synonymous with the absence of garbage and its widespread proper disposal.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Montenegro is rich and goes far into the mists of time. But since the limits on long narratives were reached in the prologue, here it is very short. Just for a better understanding of who lives here.\n\nMost of the time on the territory of modern Montenegro, it was an independent state in various reincarnations. In a changing territory.\n\nIn certain historical periods, various regions of modern Montenegro were under the rule or influence of the Ottoman Empire, the Venetian Republic, the Austrians under different brands.\n\nFor this reason, many cities in Montenegro have their own flavor. For example, in the country’s capital, Podgorica, signs of the former presence of the Turks are pretty visible.\n\nIn cities on the coast of the Bay of Kotor, such as Herceg Novi, Kotor and Perast, there is more Venetian and Austrian heritage. And they don’t all look alike.\n\nFewer repetitions make your travel across Montenegro more exciting\n\nMuch of the foundation of modern society was laid between 1946 and 1992, when Montenegro was a part of Yugoslavia. A lot of current local’s behavior patterns come from this strange-socialist period. This distinguishes Montenegrins from most Europeans. Both for the bad and for the good. The people here are a bit different. About them a bit further.\n\nModern Montenegro has existed as an independent state since 2006. This year, it peacefully withdrew from the state called “Serbia and Montenegro”. In fact, it was the final act of the extremely painful breakdown of the former Yugoslavia into separate states.\n\nImmediately after gaining independence, Montenegro headed for European integration. In 2010, it received the status of a candidate country for EU membership. Overall, Montenegro is successfully implementing the necessary reforms. The country has been a member of NATO since 2017. It was expected that Montenegro could become a member of the EU approximately in 2025.\n\nBut in 2020, an extremely strange coalition of the “swan, crayfish and pike” format came to power, brought on the “bayonets” of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Belgrade and russia. With slight inclusions of EU-oriented parties. As a result, Montenegro’s European integration perspectives have become vague. After the absurd coalition stopped existing in early 2022, the fog began to clear a bit. But now only a bit. The EU is afraid of Trojans. They have enough of Hungary.\n\nPopulation\n\nPeople in Montenegro are incredibly relaxed, in every sense. To say the least. This also applies to tourism services. People are not aggressive. But many are pretty unceremonious.\n\nStrangers are usually not smiling here, even if they are absolutely friendly (and this is almost always). The situation sometimes changes in the case of acute financial interest. Familiar?\n\nImmigrants here are mainly from russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Turkey. There are representatives of some former Yugoslav republics. Also, a lot of Bosnians, Serbs, Macedonians come seasonally. There are neraly no guys from Africa, India or Pakistan here. As well as Chinese tourists. Although already in neighboring Dubrovnik in Croatia there are almost as many of them as in Venice. But it’s actual only for the time being. So hurry up.\n\nWhat is the official currency of Montenegro?\n\nThe official currency of Montenegro is Euro. However, the country is not part of the Eurozone. Accordingly, it has no right to print euro currency.\n\nUsing the Euro is another small bonus for tourists from the Eurozone. And some others.\n\nFirstly, you can come with a card in Euro and not lose money on conversion. Of course, if your bank or payment system agrees with this.\n\nIn addition, euro cash can be bought at home at a reasonable exchange rate. In some other countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and others, this will not work.\n\nTIP\n\nI recommend you to take 30–50% in cash\n\nCards\n\nWhy take cash to Montenegro? Remember, I said at the beginning that Montenegro is noticeably different from many more developed European countries? So in terms of the availability of payment by credit card, it differs a lot. In many places, payments by card are simply not accepted here. And it’s not just about casual stuff street traders.\n\nFirstly, in many cases you will not be able to pay for accommodation with a card. And this strikingly distinguishes Montenegro from the countries of the European Union. Of course, if you book a large chain hotel, you will most likely be able to avoid such a problem.\n\nIf you have chosen apartments in some cottage for 8-10 rooms, be ready. There is most likely no payment terminal there. Now, do you understand why most apartments in Montenegro can be booked on Booking.com without prepayment? :)\n\nA similar story, for example, with boats, hairdressers and many other services. Why? There is an opinion that payment using a terminal is not widely spread here due to the terrain and related communication problems. They say it’s not reliable. Although we understand very well why entrepreneurs prefer to deal with cash :)\n\nThe good news is that in more or less big network markets you can pay with a card. And in other places where convenience for the client comes first, you can also pay by card. When buying a ticket at the bus station – sometimes you can. Interestingly, this could be done in 2019 at the bus stations of Podgorica, Budva, Herceg Novi, and Kotor. And in 2021, it seems I didn’t succeed even once in almost 2 months.\n\nFunny thing. You can buy a ticket to the Kotor fortress with a card. Although the payment process takes place in an open booth measuring half a meter by half a meter. Much like a beach shower. But here is a table with a terminal, a chair, and a guard cashier.\n\nWhy does the terminal work perfectly here, despite the peculiarities of the terrain? I’m guessing the obvious. Those who have to go back to Kotor for cash will think once more. Is it worth going up again in the heat because someone did not bother to put the terminal in the place where they simply collect €8 from tourists basically for nothing?\n\nIs it safe to use payment cards in Montenegro?\n\nExcept for one case, there was no reason to worry about security. It is not a third-world Asian country. Information about skimmers on ATMs did not reach me either through the news or through familiars living in Montenegro.\n\nConcerning “one case”. I’ll tell you right away, don’t expect a crime thriller here. Chain supermarket Idea in Herceg Novi. The cashier took the card and used it contactless. Payment accepted. What did the cashier do next? Returned a card back? No. He turned the card over, looked at the side with the CVV code for a couple of seconds, and then gave it away. Why was it necessary to do this? I did not start to investigate. There was no suspicious activity on the card after that. But just in case, I let you know.\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat to do if you have run out of cash, but your vacation in Montenegro is not finished yet?\n\nATM\n\nIf you run out of cash, you can use an ATM. There are not so many of them in Montenegro. Not at every turn. But where they logically should be, they are. There shouldn’t be much of a problem with this.\n\nBut the withdrawal fee may be unpleasant\n\nFor the first time I fed a card in Euro to the Lovcen Bank (Lovcen Banka) ATM. Issued a warning that a fixed fee of €5 is charged for each withdrawal operation. At least €5. Did not like this. Took the card back.\n\nWent to try my luck at the Erste Bank ATM. There was a similar warning. I realized that you can’t get rid with a little blood. I decided to withdraw the amount of money that should have been enough for the rest of my stay in Montenegro. The actual commission is €5 with several cents. So advice from my personal experience:\n\nTIP\n\nIf you want to save money, withdraw cash once for the entire vacation\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nIn Montenegro, cryptocurrencies are very popular in all possible manifestations. Like in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where you can safely withdraw crypto from an ATM. The exchange rate may not be perfect. But it’s a cryptocurrency.\n\nIn Montenegro itself, the situation is still far from settled. But there is a public demand for it. And it is quite possible that the opportunities for using cryptocurrency in Montenegro will widen by the time of your arrival.\n\nBanks\n\nI have already mentioned two banks. Erste Bank is one of the largest banks in Montenegro. Lovchen Bank does not seem to be one of those. But its ATMs are one of the most widely spread in tourist areas.\n\nIn addition to these two banks, it is necessary to mention CKB (Crnogorska Komercijalna Banka). There are also many ATMs of this brand. And you should pay attention to the logo and the inscription of the OTP Group on their website. Previously, this Hungarian bank, well-known in Eastern Europe, has already bought other Montenegrin banks. After CKB, I know three of them.\n\nBut I must say right away that the Montenegrin CKB/OTP Bank will have nothing in common with the bank of the same name in your country, except for the name. Commissions for withdrawing money from an ATM will be the same as for a foreign bank. The same applies to other banks that are present in both countries.\n\nBest time to visit Montenegro\n\nThe best time to go to Montenegro depends on what composition you are traveling in and what you plan to do. Let’s consider the most common cases.\n\nYou are traveling mainly for the beach holiday, without school-age kids\n\nFor you, the best time of year to visit Montenegro is the second half of May and the first half of September. At this time, the water is already/still quite warm. Families with school-age children have either not yet arrived or have already left.\n\nSimply put, the peak season has not yet started or has already passed. There are fewer tourists, freer beaches, lower prices. At the same time, the entire infrastructure works. If you wish, you can dilute your beach holiday with excursions. The weather will be as comfortable as possible (of course, no one will give out 100% rain insurance).\n\nRegarding excursions from these two periods, the second half of May is preferable. Excursions in Montenegro are mostly long, until the evening. And in May the sun sets earlier than in September. You will see more. But it is necessary to specify on what dates the tours begin.\n\nYou are traveling mainly for the beach holiday with school-age kids\n\nIn this case, Montenegro is no different from most other countries. If you do not want to overpay and be able to lay a mat on the beach, then the best time to travel to Montenegro is in June. Money is not a question, but you need the warmest water and maximum activities? Then welcome to the peak season – July and August. On some excursions, be prepared for traffic jams and queues.\n\nYou are traveling mainly for excursions, without your own transport\n\nThe best time for you is from mid-May to mid-June. And in the second half of September. At this time, Montenegro has comfortable weather, not a peak influx of tourists, and, in general, there are no significant problems with traffic jams.\n\nWhy not earlier than mid-May and not later than mid-September? At this time, some centralized tours are not yet held or are no longer held. For this reason, I did not have time to get on the two planned excursions around September 20th. But there is a way out of this situation – to book an individual tour. It will be more expensive, but much more comfortable. You can stay longer in places you like.\n\nYou are traveling mainly for excursions, with your own transport (or you are planning to rent a car)\n\nEverything is simple here. You are your own boss. When you want, then go. I mean from May to September. I have already described the advantages of the low and high seasons above. It is more likely to face rain in early May and late September. And keep in mind that some mountain serpentines in Montenegro are designed for a driver with mountain driving experience. For example, this is very important when traveling to the observation deck on Mount Lovcen.\n\nWell, it should be borne in mind that, for example, the high mountain pass Sedlo in the Durmitor National Park is usually closed from November till April. The reason is – it’s covered with snow. And this is one of the most popular places to visit in the north of Montenegro.\n\nYou also need to consider that during the peak season it is more difficult to find a good car rental option.\n\nYou don’t care. You are just going on vacation.\n\nFor you, the best time to visit Montenegro is any.\n\nMy choice\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI recommend going to Montenegro in the first half of September\n\nThe second half of May is also not bad. But September has two obvious advantages over May.\n\nFirst. In September, you are unlikely to arrive with dead white skin color. Accordingly, the risk of getting burned is much less than in May. So your vacation will be more comfortable.\n\nSecond. In May and early June, construction work is carried out almost everywhere. Somewhere I found them at the end of June. Even though, in theory, there are restrictions on construction work on the coast. Someone says that from June 1, someone – from June 15.\n\nMy experience: Montenegrins ignore all these restrictions. In 2021, out of the seven locations where I stayed (Tivat, Budva, Petrovac, Ulcinj, Bar, Podgorica, Zabljak), in four I woke up early in the morning to a perforator, jackhammer, and other «musical» instruments (Tivat, Petrovac, Bar, Podgorica ). In Ulcinj, the area as a whole was being built up, which I was aware of in advance.\n\nIn Zabljak, problems with construction noise are less likely due to the specifics of the location. Budva, it seems, turned out to be the only location where restrictions on construction work really work. Just Budva, not the whole Budvanian Riviera.\n\nThe specifics of Montenegrin builders. They start early in the morning – until it starts to get hot. Around 8:00. Sometimes even earlier. During this period, the noise is maximum. Somewhere closer to 11:00 it gradually subsides. If you used to get up at 6:00 on vacation, have breakfast, and go to the beach, then this is not a problem for you. If you also have time to get a little tan in early May, then feel free to go to Montenegro by the end of May or the beginning of June.\n\nI was in Montenegro in the second half of September twice. I can say for sure that it is difficult to name this time of the year – «autumn». It was hot most of the time. It was incredibly well remembered by the ascent to the Kotor fortress. The water temperature at this time is quite comfortable. But not in the morning. One of the possible inconveniences – it may already start to get rainy.\n\nHow to get to Montenegro\n\nThe best way to get to Montenegro is by plane. Many tourists also come with their own transport. From nearby countries, it is convenient to get by bus. The last and pretty limited option is train. Russian tourists can also start to consider pipeline transport as a real alternative.\n\nFlights\n\nI used a plane to come to Montenegro twice. There is some helpful info to share.\n\nHow long does it take to fly to Montenegro?\n\nHere is a flight time to Montenegro from several popular destinations:\n\nInternational airports of Montenegro\n\nThere are two of them in the country – Podgorica (inland) and Tivat (on the coast). The main airport of Montenegro – Podgorica – serves mainly regular flights. Tivat Airport – mostly charter and seasonal. The distance between airports is 80 km. They are operated by the same company – “Aerodromi Crne Gore” (“Airports of Montenegro”).\n\nAirports are small. Externally, they look relatively modern. But based on my experience, Montenegrin airports appeared to be the worst among those I’ve visited.\n\nHere you are met by ferity, which you are unlikely to meet outside the airports in the rest of Montenegro. But most tourists get the first impression of the country here.\n\nThey built airports but forgot about the staff. Totally.\n\nOn both arrivals (both to Podgorica and Tivat) and one departure (from Podgorica), it seemed that everything was organized here for the airport staff’s convenience, comfort and moral satisfaction. And you, as a tourist, must meet their expectations.\n\nEnglish at the airports of Montenegro ends at the check-in counters. And it can appear to a limited extent in a cafe in the departure zone. In 99% of other situations, they will communicate with you (mainly demanding something) in the local language.\n\nProcesses management at airports is somewhere near the bottom. Almost every employee responsible for controlling something strives to show that he is a very important boss here. Who can strictly demand something from you in his native language. Sincerely not understanding, how can you not understand them. In 2019, in Podgorica, border guards casually threw passports through the window. Not the case in May 2021 in Tivat anymore. Apparently, due to the fact that in Montenegro, due to Covid restrictions, the country was empty. And the flight from Kyiv was one of the first of that season. In 2023, there was no negativity either. I won’t tell you everything here. But let me give you one illustrative episode.\n\nFlying from Budapest. Arrival was expected at 21:05. And it was the last flight arrival that day. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The stamped passport was contemptuously thrown back behind the glass by the border guard.\n\nPicked up luggage. Went out to the airport lobby. I sat down on the seat to order a taxi in messenger. But I did not have time to write a message. About half a minute later a security guard came up and demanded to leave the terminal. Of course, in Montenegrin and using gestures. Welcome to Montenegro!\n\nSo there is an obvious tip:\n\nTIP\n\nDo not fly to Montenegro if the airport staff is already going home. Fly back the next morning.\n\nPage of anger – done :) Now some official information about airports.\n\nPodgorica Airport (TGD)\n\nPodgorica Airport also sometimes appears with the prefix “Golubovci”, after the name of the village next to it. The non-obvious airport code – TGD – is associated with the previous name of Podgorica. In 1952-92 it was Titovgrad, in honor of Josip Broz Tito – the long-time leader of Yugoslavia. The native name was returned to the city, but the airport code was not changed.\n\nThe primary air gates of Montenegro, like Podgorica city itself, are located in a valley surrounded by mountains and hills.\n\nThe location of the “Podgorica” (TGD) airport on the map – 42.35979, 19.24965.\n\nThe airport in Podgorica is relatively modern but very small. Like many other objects in Montenegro, the capital’s airport does not look like what you are used to seeing in major air hubs of European capitals. There are no jetways here. But due to the compactness of the airport itself, this is not a problem. Buses are simply not needed here. You just get out and go to the plane, or from the plane ladder to the terminal.\n\nWhat airlines fly to Podgorica in 2024?\n\nIn 2024, the number of flights to Podgorica Airport has not significantly changed, nor has the flight map. Among the main changes:\n\nIn 2024, the budget Turkish carrier Pegasus Airlines launched flights to Podgorica from three Turkish airports: Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir.\n\nThe local airline Air Montenegro began flying from Frankfurt (Germany) and Copenhagen (Denmark) and replaced the Hungarian airline Wizz Air on the Rome-Podgorica route.\n\nIn 2024, the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair ceased flights from Barcelona to Podgorica.\n\nList of flights to Podgorica airport for the 2024 season:\n\nPodgorica airport arrivals & departures\n\nTransfer from the airport\n\nThere is no shuttle bus from the airport to Podgorica. Individual tourists use a taxi. Further from the Podgorica bus station, you can go where you need to. The airport is close to the city. It is just 11 km from the airport to the bus station in Podgorica. 15 minutes drive time. Taxi costs from €15.\n\nBy the way, from the airport by taxi, you can get not only to Podgorica but also directly to the coast. In 2019, I was told that the price to Budva is €60. But it was not in the most favorable environment, and I already had accommodation booked in Podgorica. So I did not bargain because it was not interesting for me. But for some of you it may be quite relevant. For example, if 3-4 people are traveling, you can immediately take a taxi to the resort without much loss of money. Definitely today it will cost more.\n\nTivat Airport (TIV)\n\nTivat Airport is located on the coast. Literally – on the Bay of Kotor shore. Serves mainly charter and seasonal flights. There are also regular routes. For example, Tivat-Belgrade.\n\nThe location of the “Tivat” (TIV) airport on the map – 42.40388, 18.72439.\n\nFor tourists interested in beaches, Tivat airport has a much more advantageous location in comparison with Podgorica airport. The distance to Budva is only 21 km, to Herceg Novi – 23 km, to Kotor – 8 km. And you won’t believe it, but Tivat town is just around the corner.\n\nThe airport is small, even smaller than in Podgorica. And for this reason, some of the problems of the capital’s airport are even more acute. There are few seating places both in the hall and the departure zone. The end of the check-in line often ends on the street. Yes, you can see it yourself on Google Street View.\n\nGoogle users rank Tivat Airport worse than Podgorica Airport, which is also rated low.\n\nWhat airlines fly to Tivat?\n\nList of flights to Podgorica airport for the 2024 season:\n\nTivat Airport arrivals & departures\n\nDubrovnik Airport (DBV, Croatia)\n\nDubrovnik Airport in Croatia is located 18 km from the border with Montenegro, 29 km from Herceg Novi and 72 km from Budva. It also appears with the prefix “Chilipi”, after the name of the nearby village.\n\nThe location of the “Dubrovnik” (DBV) airport on the map – 42.56129, 18.26755.\n\nDuring the summer season, you can fly to Dubrovnik from many European countries. The price range is quite broad. Very cheap tickets for Dubrovnik are not typical. You can find them, but mainly on the short routes.\n\nDubrovnik airport compares favorably with Montenegrin airports. Quite comfortable. The only inconvenience is that there is no direct bus connection with Montenegro. Passing buses do not stop at the airport. Although it is located basically on the highway. Therefore, you have to travel in transit through the Dubrovnik bus station. And it’s about an hour bus ride one way.\n\nCroatia/Montenegro border control\n\nCroatia is a member of the European Union. Montenegro is not. It doesn’t matter that countries were once part of one state. This is the regular external border of the EU, with full-fledged border control. In the middle and end of September, it took me about 40 minutes to pass both borders one way. In the high season it can be much longer.\n\nSummary\n\nIf your main goal is Montenegro, then there is not a lot of sense in considering Dubrovnik as an alternative airport. But…\n\nTIP\n\nIf you want to see both Dubrovnik and Montenegro, starting with arrival in Dubrovnik is a good idea\n\nThis option is good if you want to visit Dubrovnik not as part of a group excursion, but on your own, calmly and measuredly. Which I strongly advise you to do. Just stay there for at least three nights. Spend one full day in Dubrovnik’s old town. Dedicate another one to visit Lokrum Island. And then you can take a regular bus and go to Montenegro.\n\nDubrovnik airport arrivals & departures\n\nTirana Airport (TIA, Albania)\n\nAlbanian Tirana Airport is located 140 km from Podgorica.\n\nTIP\n\nIf you want to see Tirana, Shkoder and nearby attractions in Albania along the way, you can consider arriving at Tirana Airport\n\nThis option is good if you want to visit Albania not as part of a group tour. Which I also advise you to do. It makes sense to stay for 3-4 full days in Tirana. Believe me, most likely, this city will surprise you. In addition to Tirana itself, it makes sense to go to Berat and Kruje.\n\nThen for another 2-3 full days you can go to Shkodra (or Shkoder). It is already very close to the Montenegrin border. Also an exciting place. One or two days can be dedicated to the city itself. For another day, you can go to Lake Koman.\n\nAnd then, by bus, you can go to Montenegro – to Podgorica or Ulcinj. Although such a bus can be only one per day.\n\nLocation of the “Tirana” (TIA) airport on the map – 41.41628, 19.71641.\n\nTirana airport arrivals & departures\n\nWhich airport to choose?\n\nConsidering that both Montenegrin airports are usable and both are not the airports of your dream, I will give such recommendations on selecting an arrival airport.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nDon’t look at the distance from the airport to your final destination. Look at ticket prices, arrival time and the airlines operating the flights.\n\nIt’s much more important. Sometimes you can easily pay for a taxi from the airport to your apartment door for the price margin. And only if the offers are about the same, select based on which city you plan to stay in upon arrival.\n\nBoth airports are suitable for towns located on the Budva Riviera (Budva, Becici, Rafailovici, Przno, Milocer, Sveti Stefan).\n\nIf you are traveling to Herceg Novi, Kotor, or another town in the Bay of Kotor area, it makes sense to prefer Tivat airport.\n\nAre you going to Petrovac and the towns to the south of it, such as Bar and Ulcinj? Then it is better to use Podgorica airport. As well as if you are not going to the coast.\n\nIs it possible to get to Montenegro by train?\n\nYes, you can get to Montenegro by train. Although in Montenegro the train is an exotic type of transport. By train, you can get to Podgorica and Niksic. And on the coast – only to Bar. To one only – the city with this name. Not to any drinking establishment with a terrace that you might already notice on Foursquare, Google Maps, or in the Instagram story of some pretty girl.\n\nHow to get to Montenegro by train?\n\nIn fact, the only international railway route to Montenegro is from the capital of Serbia. The train from Belgrade goes to Podgorica in about 10 hours. But it is not certain. Google it yourself :) If you’re coming from Belgrade, I’d also consider using a bus or plane.\n\nSuppose you are still interested in the train. In that case, you can check the current timetable on the website of the Montenegrin Railways – http://www.zicg.me/.\n\nTo Montenegro by bus\n\nThe bus is a quite convenient option to get to Montenegro from neighboring or nearby countries. So, if you are traveling in Europe and Montenegro is your next stop, this type of transport makes sense to consider.\n\nThere are many international bus routes to Montenegro. In addition, one of the transnational highways is laid along the Adriatic coast, including Montenegrin. This route is called the Adriatic Highway (Jadranska magistrala).\n\nDeciding to get to Montenegro by the coastal highway from the North, you will get a huge bonus. This path is replete with beautiful sea and mountain landscapes.\n\nTo Montenegro by car\n\nA trip to Montenegro by car is more than possible. In some cases, it makes a lot of sense. Since traveling around Montenegro itself by car has several advantages. In addition to the usual arguments in favor of your own vehicle in front of someone else’s bus, there are additional ones in Montenegro.\n\nPublic transport in the country does a pretty good job of moving people along the main highways. But, if you need to take a step aside, the shortcomings of the transport network appear. And on the sides there are many exciting things. This is not even to mention some of the famous beaches.\n\nOften the only choice is a taxi. Although the prices for this type of transport in Montenegro are quite sparing compared to the EU countries, this is still a relatively expensive option. And not as flexible as an own car.\n\nDownsides of traveling to Montenegro by car\n\nCompared to air travel, traveling by car takes much more time, which could be spent traveling around Montenegro itself.\n\nBenefits\n\nAlong the way, you can see other exciting countries in the Balkans that are significantly underestimated in the mass tourist consciousness.\n\nThings to remember\n\nSome roads in Montenegro are narrow mountain serpentines. For an unprepared driver, such conditions can be complicated and even dangerous.\n\nDuring the high season, traffic in tourist areas is very busy here. Traffic jam is very probable. And the lack of free parking problem is acute even in a quieter time of the year.\n\nWhere to stay in Montenegro: Hotels, Apartments, Hostels\n\nLet me remind you right away that Montenegro is not Turkey or Egypt. Hotels in Montenegro are different. Here it is not customary to spend most of the time in the hotel’s big territory, with an All Inclusive system. Since everything interesting is outside of them. And it is pretty convenient and safe to move around the tourist regions on your own.\n\nNow let’s move to accommodation options in Montenegro.\n\nYou will need a white carton\n\nAnyone who has never been to Montenegro may wonder why. But it is needed. Without this, they may fine you around €300 when leaving the country. Or you may not be allowed to enter Montenegro in the future.\n\nAs you may have guessed, we are not talking about the heavy white paper. In Montenegro, there is a rather strange relic of the past. When you check-in, the hotel or apartment owner must register you in the police or tourist office. And pay the fee for the number of nights you are staying. This fee is approximately €1 per night. It is different in different communities. If you don’t pay, you may suffer.\n\nYou must register within 24 hours of entry. If the day of arrival is a weekend or holiday, then on the next working day.\n\nHow is a white carton obtained? From a tourist’s point of view, it’s rather strange. The apartments charge you tax inclusive if you haven’t paid everything in advance. Take your passport and go to the tourist office or the police. They register you, add your info to the database, and return your passport.\n\nThey don’t always give you a physical paper. Often they don’t give anything at all. Just say that they registered you as expected, and that’s it. Usually, there is no trick here. That’s exactly how it all works. But when leaving the country, border guards may ask you for a receipt for payment of the fee. In theory. In practice, this has not happened recently. The database is electronic, and they can check everything themselves. Unless, of course, you really registered as expected.\n\nBut if you wish, you can go for registration together with the owner of the apartment. Check the use of your passport and make sure that you are registered. Also, you can register yourself and pay the fee.\n\nUsually, the owners returned quickly from registration. But why this is necessary today is a mystery. This is probably because few places accept non-cash cards to pay for accommodation. Therefore, to increase control, they have to register each guest. Tito would like this. I won’t.\n\nI did not specify how the process of obtaining white cartons works in hotels. In theory, in a hotel with 300 rooms there is no sense in running to the tourist or police every time. But you never know.\n\nIn general, do not forget – you need white cardboard. For 100% certainty, it is better to have a receipt for payment of the fee in physical form. Although in practice, few people bother with this.\n\nBut there is a case when you should bother with paper versions. You will definitely need them if, for some reason, you stayed in Montenegro for more than a month. And after a month, you need to register in a community where you have not stayed yet. In this situation, the tourist office will try to send you to the police each time for violating registration rules. Although, it’s not really required. It’s just one more «don’t give a damn» attitude by Montenegrin authorities.\n\nHotels\n\nIn Montenegro, the space around hotels is mostly small or absent. Although there are exceptions, such as Hotel Slovenska Plaza in Budva or Iberostar Bellevue – All Inclusive in Becici. The All Inclusive system is not widely spread. There are no completely private hotel beaches as you may know them, for example, in Egypt. In mass locations, something like this can only be seen on the beach in Sveti Stefan and neighboring beaches, with sunbeds for €100 per day.\n\nApartments, Flats\n\nHotels (in the usual sense of the word) mainly belong to the “package” tourists. For self-guided tourists, booking an apartment or flat in terms of quality and price is preferable.\n\nApartments\n\nThere are a lot of apartments on the coast of Montenegro. This is perhaps the most popular type of accommodation for tourists. Often these are not skyscrapers but small 2-3-storey cottages managed by the family that owns them. And, most likely, living next door to you.\n\nThe overpayment for the presence of a kitchen is usually small. Confidently pays off by saving on food in bars and restaurants.\n\nFlats\n\nYou can rent not only a tourist apartment but also a regular flat. These two options have a lot in common. But there are also some differences. In a cottage with apartments, most likely, all the neighbors will be vacationers. Plus, it can be some maintenance. For example, cleaning. The apartment can be located in an ordinary building, and the neighbors will be local. No services may be provided. And the apartment owner can live at the other end of the city.\n\nFeatures of renting apartments in Montenegro\n\nWhen deciding to rent a flat or holiday apartment in Montenegro, you need to understand several local features.\n\n1. Renting out housing for tourists on the Montenegrin coast is approximately done by every second person.\n\n2. Most often, the landlord rents out several rooms or even one room. Often this equals a number of rooms in their own house, where the owners themselves live permanently.\n\n3. In Montenegro, the majority run a rental business on their own. Often they serve the apartments themself from A to Z. And they do it according to their vision. Not according to the experience that you had in more developed countries :)\n\n4. Usually, when a Montenegrin begins to equip apartments for rent, they want to make them look cool. Sometimes even willing to spend a lot of money on it. With plans to make apartments popular. So it will be possible to price them higher and earn more. But at some stage the reality sets in, and enthusiasm starts to dry up. You can often detect such examples in Montenegro when you enter your room.\n\n5. If something breaks in the room or the guests break it, and you can live without it in principle, then it is not customary to repair it. Since this was not the owner’s fault, this is not their problem. Why should they spend their money on repairs? In Montenegro, the logic is like this. Therefore, all the following guests will deal with the results of their predecessors’ negligent attitude towards other people’s property. Typical examples are a cracked glass shelf in the bathroom, a cracked mirror, dropping out sockets, and broken tableware.\n\n6. Things that need to be replaced or repaired through no guest’s fault also have little chance of being restored, renewed, or replaced. Examples are a partially broken light, a rusty dryer rack for clothes, etc. Or the following case. The owners ordered a mattress for the room. It turned out to be pretty bad, with springs digging into the body. There are a lot of negative reviews on Booking.com. The reaction of the owner – we will no longer order by phone. But for now… :)\n\n7. Montenegrins are most often worried about a good rating on Booking.com. Guests are frequently asked if everything is ok. And they hope for a positive response. If not everything is ok, then they try to help. Until it costs them nothing or the price is low. And while it does not provide them with any tangible discomfort. Demanding for fixes is useless. Here everyone is his own boss. So they can only force or threaten to fire themself. The Montenegrin will not go for this. Therefore, you need to ask politely.\n\n8. Since rented apartments for Montenegrins are their own, native, beloved, in which their money and soul are invested, they often react very painfully to criticism. Personally, I have not been involved in such situations. But this is very clearly seen in the host’s responses to comments on Booking.com. Croats, for example, do not react this way.\n\nWrapping out. When selecting an apartment in Montenegro, carefully read the reviews. On Booking.com, I recommend you to initially filter out everything below 9.0. Be prepared for minor issues and the fact that, in reality, the apartment will look more «tired» than in the photo. And be ready that the price/quality ratio in Montenegro is very random. There is no guarantee at all that for much more money you get much better quality.\n\nVillas, houses\n\nYou can also rent a villa. Or a house. Consider that in Montenegro a house = a villa. This is not Bali, where you can rent a one-story bungalow for $400 a month. Here, the cost of land in the resort area is too high. There is little sense for owners to build tiny one-story houses. Therefore, consider that renting a completely separate house on the coast of Montenegro means renting a villa, at the price of a villa.\n\nHostels\n\nPodgorica\n\nMost Montenegrin hostels are located in Podgorica. And many are used as a place to spend the night between arrival at the airport and departure to the coast or mountainous areas. Or in the opposite direction. It is difficult to call Podgorica a tourist city. Therefore, long-term tourists are rare.\n\nHostels on the coast of Montenegro\n\nThere are not a lot of hostels in the resort area. But there are some. And some of them are pretty authentic, as they are located in historical buildings. For example, in the Old Town of Budva or Kotor.\n\nAmong the hostels in the Old Town of Budva with good ratings on reviews, one can note Freedom Hostel Budva and Freedom Hostel 2. Among the less rated Hostel Michel (many of its reviews are quite remarkable). Among the more regular hostels in Budva is Hostel Montevision.\n\nKotor Old Town is even more interesting in terms of accommodation options, as it is much larger than the Old Town of Budva. Walking along the streets of Kotor, you regularly notice how some group of tourists is standing under the doors of some historical building, waiting for check-in. An example of a hostel with a good rating is – Old Town Youth Hostel.\n\nWhat is the best way to book apartments in Montenegro?\n\nAs of 2024, to search for hotels, apartments, flats and hostels in Montenegro, I recommend using Booking.com. Airbnb is also available in Montenegro. There are many offers. But so far, there are much more of them on Booking.com. This means more choice, more options at an attractive price.\n\nHowever, everyone’s needs are different. Perhaps what you are looking for (for example, a room) can be found on Airbnb.\n\nPrepare cash\n\nAs mentioned above, payment by card in Montenegro is not held in high esteem. You can do it in big hotels. But in small apartment complexes, get ready to pay with cash. Otherwise, you will have to search for an ATM and withdraw money with a not very pleasant commission.\n\nWhat to do in Montenegro (Kinds of tourism)\n\nTwo main kinds of tourism in Montenegro are obvious – beach and sightseeing.\n\nBeach holidays\n\nBeach holidays in Montenegro are neither “Turkish” nor “Egyptian”. There are almost no private beaches exclusively for hotel guests. Most beaches are pebble, sand and pebble or platforms. The entrance to the water is usually pebbly. Free places are not easy to find in the high season, even on paid sun loungers.\n\nExcursion tourism\n\nThis type of tourism in Montenegro is also actively developed. Albeit a bit specific. Most of the attractions here are natural. There are just a lot of unrealistically beautiful places. There are also historical and architectural sites. But the artificial excursion programs are definitely less impressive than natural ones.\n\nWhat do I mean when I say that excursion tourism in Montenegro is specific?\n\nThe main routes are a small set of standard excursions at the same prices. A distinctive feature is that they are very long. Usually, they start very early in the morning. Due to the country’s small size, the program of many excursions includes almost half of all the most popular attractions. This is not suitable for everyone.\n\nWinter tourism\n\nYes, there are alpine skiing resorts in Montenegro. And not only alpine skiing. Although not a lot of foreigners know about them. First of all, these are Kolasin and Zabljak. These resorts are pretty good. Kolasin is more modern.\n\nSnow stays from December to March. A bit of the season can be caught even in early April. Winter resorts focus on alpine and cross-country skiing, snowboarding and a bit of freestyle. Cycling and ecotourism flourish in the “winter” resorts in summer.\n\nCities and resorts of Montenegro\n\nConsidering that about 650 thousand people live in the country, it is easy to guess that the cities in Montenegro are small in terms of population.\n\nI will briefly talk about 24 cities, towns and villages that can be interesting for you when planning a trip to Montenegro and already while traveling around the country.\n\nPodgorica\n\nAbout Podgorica\n\nPodgorica is the capital of Montenegro. The largest city in the country and the most significant transport hub. Located in a valley surrounded by hills and mountains. From many points of the city you can see gorgeous panoramas and views.\n\nEven though Podgorica is the main gateway to Montenegro, the city does not look and feel like a tourist site. Actually, it is not positioned that way. There is no sea in Podgorica. You need to drive 60 km or 1-1.5 hours to Budva or Petrovac.\n\nDistance from Podgorica to cities and resorts on the coast of Montenegro:\n\nBudva\n\nThe city of Budva is the main resort of Montenegro. The most famous and most popular. And this is for a reason. Budva is located in a very picturesque place, at the foot of the mountains, in a bay on the Adriatic Sea. The views begin to fascinate as soon as you cross the pass on the way from Podgorica and start descending towards Budva and Becici along the scenic mountain serpentine.\n\nThe location of Budva is exceptionally convenient. The city is closest to Podgorica with its airport compared to all other resorts – in 65 km. The second international airport of Montenegro – Tivat – is just 20 km away. In addition, Budva is located “in the middle” of the resort area. It is approximately equidistant from the most distant Montenegrin cities on the sea coast. To Herceg Novi, near the border with Croatia – 44 km. And to Ulcinj, near the border with Albania – 64 km.\n\nNext, we start moving south along the Budva Riviera.\n\nBecici\n\nThe village of Becici is Budva’s closest neighbor. The population of Becici is about 1000 people. But the number of rooms here is imposing. One large hotel can accommodate more vacationers than residents who permanently live in the village.\n\nThe length of the beach in Becici is about the same as the Slovenska Plaza in Budva. At the same time, the beach in Becici is much wider. The pebbles here are smaller and mainly near the water. Further from the seaside – mostly sand. The sea is much cleaner than on the Slovenska Plaza.\n\nBecici beach is also considered to be one of the most beautiful in Montenegro. Frankly, I find it difficult to answer why.\n\nIn Becici, part of the beach may not be accessible to everyone. This applies to the beaches near the Zavala peninsula separating Becici and Budva. Nearby hotels Iberostar Bellevue – All Inclusive 4* and Hotel Montenegro 4 * rent these beaches. So you may be politely asked to leave them if you are not staying in one of these hotels. Although, in theory, they are public. But in any case, this is only a small part of the entire beach in Becici.\n\nIn general, Becici has a much calmer atmosphere than Budva. It is more suitable for families. On the territory of Mediteran Hotel & Resort 4 *, there is a relatively big water park.\n\nNew hotels are being actively built on the second line and further, including high ones.\n\nRafailovici\n\nRafailovici village is nestled compactly on the edge of the bay, next to Becici. Visually resembles a heap of hotels and apartment complexes. It is also a place of concentration of cafes, bars and shops.\n\nIn Rafailovici, the beach is much narrower than in Becici. Rafailovici ends around the corner with an entourage tunnel to Kamenevo beach. Lighting in the tunnel is provided. But it was turned off when I passed there several times during the day. You are basically walking in total darkness. Especially when the sunlight at the entrance to the tunnel has already disappeared, and from the exit has not appeared yet.\n\nI would include Kamenevo in the top three of the best beaches in Montenegro I have visited. The water here is one of the cleanest I have ever seen. Apparently, mainly because there are few pollutants (boats) parked here.\n\nPrzno/Milocer\n\nKamenevo beach is followed by Przno village with 300 inhabitants and several small beaches. One of them is Pržno beach itself. Another one is Milocer Beach (aka Royal Beach or King’s Beach). The latter is small-pebble.\n\nUntil 2021, it was paid and very expensive. However, it does not provide any exceptional service. Just deck сhairs with umbrellas are located at a decent distance from each other. Perfect for fans of privacy for big money – about €100. And for the guests of the title hotel – Villa Milocer.\n\nAnother similar beach is the Kraljicina Plaza (or Queen’s beach). Until 2021, it was also secluded, paid and expensive. And all this is surrounded by the magnificent Milocer Park.\n\nAt the end of May 2021, walking along the coast south of Budva, I was surprised to find both beaches open to everyone. As it turned out, the management company ruling the adjacent territories retired from the Montenegrin market. And the beaches were opened.\n\nBut in July 2023, the company returned. The price for two sun loungers and an umbrella at Milocer Beach has grown to €200. And Queen’s Beach is now exclusively accessible only to guests of the Villa Milocer hotel.\n\nIn general, the history of the owners of these coastal lands is covered with a thick layer of uncertainty. One tour guide, for example, claimed that these places are the private property of a local family of “Rockefellerovici” (the name has been changed for artistic purposes). So the beaches can be closed at any time. Water resources are the property of the people, free access to the sea. Yeah, sure :)\n\nAnd literally behind the cape from Milocer beach there is another similar beach, much more famous.\n\nSveti Stefan\n\nPeninsula\n\nIt should be noted right away that Sveti Stefan is both a peninsula and a village on the mainland. The peninsula of Sveti Stefan is a kind of elite resort located entirely in historical buildings. Very popular among world celebrities. Only guests of the apartments located on it can get on it. And the prices are appropriate.\n\nIn 2021, I found a barn lock (figuratively) on the resort’s front doors. The reason is the same – the peninsula of Sveti Stefan was under the control of the same company that left.\n\nBut on July 15, 2023, the resort on the Sveti Stefan peninsula started operating again, with all the resulting negative consequences for regular vacationers.\n\nThe village of Sveti Stefan is a place a little more reasonable by price.\n\nBeach\n\nThe beach of Sveti Stefan is divided into two parts by an isthmus that connects the peninsula with the mainland. By the way, it is of natural origin. On both parts of the beach, the sand and small pebbles have a reddish tint.\n\nIf you stand on the shore and look at the peninsula, then the elite part of the beach will be on your right. Guests of hotels on the peninsula can use this beach for free. For the rest, the entrance fee is against charge. Here, sun loungers with umbrellas are also located far from each other.\n\nAt the end of May 2021, I discovered the Sveti Stefan beach without sun loungers, open to everyone. But in 2023, the leasing company returned. And in July 2023, the beach became paid again. Now the cost of two sun loungers in the elite section of the beach is €180.\n\nThere are fewer pebbles here than on the free part, and it is smaller.\n\nThe public part of Sveti Stefan beach, located on the left-hand side, is free. But sun loungers are still more expensive than the average on the Montenegrin coast. The pebbles are a little bigger here.\n\nPetrovac\n\nMoving further to the south. The next popular tourist city in Montenegro is Petrovac. Located 17 km from Budva, on the bay shore. Petrovac is surrounded by olive and coniferous groves along with many other trees typical of the local latitudes. The air here is clean and considered curative.\n\nIn the area of ​​Petrovac along the coast, in the midst of lush vegetation, the so-called Health Trails are laid. This is an excellent alternative to lying on the beach. Benches are provided for tired travelers. One of the trails goes towards the village of Rezevici, passing the Perazica Do beach.\n\nThe other is from Lucice beach to Buljarica beach.\n\nDistance from Petrovac to:\n\nTivat airport – 40 km\n\nPodgorica airport – 47 km\n\nBudva – 18 km\n\nNext, we will stop moving to the south of the Montenegrin coast and fast forward to the area of ​​the Bay of Kotor.\n\nHerceg Novi\n\nThe town of Herceg Novi is located in a very picturesque place, on the shores of the Bay of Kotor (or Boka Kotorska). This is the northernmost of the major cities on the Montenegrin coast. Located near the border with Croatia. The major part of Herceg Novi is located on a slope. For this reason, there are many steep climbs, stairs, terraces and beautiful landscapes.\n\nDistance from Herceg Novi to:\n\nTivat airport – 24 km\n\nPodgorica airport – 110 km\n\nBudva – 45 km\n\nDubrovnik (Croatia) – 50 km\n\nKotor\n\nThe city of Kotor is considered a must-see place in Montenegro. It is located in a fantastic place on the shore of the Bay of Kotor, at the foot of Mount Lovcen.\n\nOld Town\n\nThe Old Town of Kotor is the largest of those preserved in Montenegro. And it was well preserved precisely as a whole town, and not separate historical buildings. Massive city walls have also been preserved. Already at the entrance, it is clear that something impressive has appeared before you. Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nDistance from Kotor to:\n\nTivat airport – 8 km\n\nPodgorica airport – 88 km\n\nBudva – 23 km\n\nHerceg Novi – 44 km\n\nDobrota\n\nThe city of Dobrota is Kotor’s closest neighbor. In fact, one city smoothly flows into another. Dobrota is stretched along the coast of the Bay of Kotor. Very stretched out.\n\nDobrota also has a rich history, although as rich as its neighbor’s. The architecture is mainly from the Venetian era. There are no really significant objects here. But the town itself is pretty nice, with beautiful views from the waterfront.\n\nDonji Orahovac\n\nDonji Orahovac is a small village on the shore of the Bay of Kotor. A little north of Dobrota. A place for a very relaxing holiday. The beaches here are good, and the water is one of the cleanest in the entire Bay of Kotor. There are no attractions.\n\nPrcanj\n\nFrom the lower and upper parts of Kotor, you will have beautiful views of the opposite peninsula and the villages on the coast. Those that are further away, on several capes, are the town of Prcanj. Located just opposite Dobrota. Like many other neighbors in the Bay of Kotor, it has a rich history. And also reached its heyday in the times of the Venetian Republic.\n\nPerast\n\nPerast is a small old town on the shore of the Bay of Kotor. Very well preserved. Located in one of the most picturesque places in Montenegro. On the slope, at the foot of the mountain. On the cape separating the Kotor and Risan bays. And right in front of the Verige Strait.\n\nOpposite Perast, there are two islands – St. George and Gospa od Shkrpjela (Mother of God on the Reef), very close to each other. The first is of natural origin, and the second is artificial.\n\nDistance from Perast to:\n\nTivat airport – 20 km\n\nPodgorica airport – 100 km\n\nBudva – 35 km\n\nHerceg Novi – 31 km\n\nKotor – 12 km\n\nRisan\n\nThe town of Risan is another ancient town on the coast of Boka Kotorska. The closest neighbor is Perast. Situated in a relatively flat area. The population is about 2000 people.\n\nRisan is considered the oldest settlement in the area of ​​the Bay of Kotor. And it was known long before Kotor or Perast. For this reason, traces of both Venetians and Romans remained here. In particular – ancient Roman mosaics. They are perhaps the main attraction of Risan. There are not a lot of historical buildings here.\n\nCompared to Perast, tourists rarely come to Risan. Although from one town to another you can just walk. But Risan has clean air, clean water and a relaxed atmosphere. And there are a lot of apartments for rent.\n\nTivat\n\nThe city of Tivat is located on the shore of the Bay of Kotor, on the Vrmac peninsula. It is a highly convenient transportation hub. Firstly, the only airport on the Montenegrin coast is located here. Secondly, there is a brand new harbor of Porto Montenegro for yachts, including large ones.\n\nAt the same time, Tivat is located precisely between Budva and Herceg Novi. And Kotor is just around the corner. A few steps away is the Lepetane-Kamenari ferry across the Verige strait of the Bay of Kotor. All this makes Tivat one of the very convenient places to stay in Montenegro for those who plan to see the whole country.\n\nIn order not to be unfounded, I will give data on the distance between Tivat and other significant cities in Montenegro.\n\nDistance from Tivat to:\n\nKotor – 11 km.\n\nBudva – 25 km.\n\nHerceg Novi – 21 km.\n\nPodgorica – 87 km.\n\nKumbor and Djenovici\n\nRecently, the name of the town of Kumbor, with a population of about 1000 people, has been mentioned much more often than before. This happened after the commissioning of the brand new Portonovi marina and related infrastructure on the coast. All this is directly adjacent to Kumbor on the one hand and the village of Djenovici on the other.\n\nPreviously, Kumbor and Djenovici were quiet tourist villages. With beautiful nature and good uncrowded beaches with clear water. Their role will be likely to change in the coming years.\n\nWe have finished with the cities of the Bay of Kotor. Let’s return back to the south.\n\nSutomore\n\nSutomore is a small town in the southern part of the Montenegrin Adriatic coast. First of all, this is a pretty good budget resort, with a relatively long beach. Sutomore is one of the places in Montenegro that is well suited for a classic beach holiday.\n\nDistance from Sutomore to:\n\nTivat airport – 51 km\n\nPodgorica airport – 38 km\n\nBudva – 31 km\n\nBar – 9 km\n\nBar\n\nBar is a city in the southern part of the Adriatic coast of Montenegro. The largest port in the country and the largest city on the coast. One of the few places in Montenegro where a fairly vast plain is located between the mountains and the sea.\n\nIt does not have a huge tourist value due to the lack of good beaches with clean water. But there are some places to see in Bar. First of all, the Old Town, with a superb panorama and old Roman aqueduct. If you need a good beach nearby, you can get to Canj beach by bus.\n\nDistance from the city of Bar to:\n\nTivat airport – 60 km\n\nPodgorica airport – 46 km\n\nBudva – 39 km\n\nUlcinj – 27 km\n\nUtjeha\n\nUtjeha is a small town in the southern part of the Montenegrin coast. Located between Bar and Ulcinj. It has no significant historical value. More interesting for its natural wealth.\n\nIn the Utjeha area, the water is immaculately clean and has a beautiful turquoise hue. The coast is indented. As a result, there are several small wild beaches. The beaches here are platforms or pebbles (pebbles are mostly large). The main beach of Uteha is Uvala Maslina (platform + pebbles).\n\nUtjeha is an exciting place for divers. In addition to clean and transparent water, there are many caves and grottoes.\n\nUlcinj\n\nUlcinj is the southernmost city in Montenegro. Located on the shores of the Adriatic Sea. The majority of the population are ethnic Albanians. Approximately 80% of the city’s residents are Muslims. For this reason, some are even afraid to go on vacation to Ulcinj.\n\nI spent a week in the city. And I can tell you responsibly that there is nothing to fear. Ulcinj is just an unusual city for Montenegro. It is different. They speak more Albanian than Montenegrin. And may even not understand the official local language. There you can sometimes meet women in Muslim clothes (not often) and gypsies (even more often). But in terms of security, there is no big difference with other areas of the Montenegrin coast.\n\nUlcinj is quite a popular tourist destination. But overall underrated. The southern outskirts of the city are where the longest beach on the Adriatic coast – Velika Plaza (aka Big Beach or Long Beach) – starts. Its length is 12 km. The beach is entirely sandy. And not only long but also wide. On the part of the beach, a coniferous forest adjoins the sandy strip. Which is perfect for hot weather. And this is not a frequent story for Montenegro.\n\nAs it turned out on the spot, there were exciting places to see and to walk.\n\nDistance from Ulcinj to:\n\nTivat airport – 85 km\n\nPodgorica airport – 72 km\n\nBudva – 65 km\n\nBar – 27 km\n\nShkodra (Albania) – 42 km\n\nAda Bojana Island\n\nVelika Plaza ends at the Bojana River (or Buna – in Albanian), behind which Ada Bojana Island is located. Behind it is the border with Albania. Along the riverbed, you can find apartments, bars and restaurants serving freshly caught freshwater and saltwater fish.\n\nThe origin of the island of Ada Bojana is absolutely non-trivial. It was intended by nature that there would be two small islands at the mouth of the Boyana River. But the notorious human factor treacherously intervened. In 1858, the sailing ship Merito sank between the islands. Nature cursed for a long time, and eventually decided to fill the entire space between the islands with sand, forming a triune island.\n\nOver time, the entire space was overgrown with green spaces, in which by 1973 nudists began to actively pull themselves up. So the resort was formed here. Then – exclusively for foreign nudists. As you know, communist values, even Yugoslav ones, did not encourage bathing adults without panties in public places. But Tito has been gone for a long time, and there is a nudist resort for pensioners with a large sandy beach on Ada Bojana.\n\nCetinje\n\nThe city of Cetinje is the “second” capital of Montenegro. In the past it was the only one. Here is the presidential residence and the Ministry of Culture. Cetinje is considered the cultural and spiritual capital of Montenegro.\n\nThe city is located in a valley at the foot of the Lovcen mountain range. Cetinje is situated on the way from Podgorica to Budva, precisely in the middle between them. Distance to the coast – 32 km, to Podgorica – 36 km.\n\nCetinje is the most convenient location from which you can get to the top of Mount Lovcen. Individual tourists often take a taxi in Cetinje for these purposes, go to Lovcen, spend a couple of hours there and return in the same car. The distance from the center of Cetinje to the top of Lovcen is 25 km.\n\nKolasin\n\nKolasin is a town in the north of Montenegro. Next to it, at an altitude of about 1500 m, there is a ski resort of the same name. In fact, there are two of them – Kolasin 1450 and Kolasin 1600. The city is located 72 km north of Podgorica. It is considered the most modern ski resort in Montenegro.\n\nDistance from Kolasin to:\n\nPodgorica airport – 81 km\n\nTivat airport – 157 km\n\nBudva – 137 km\n\nZabljak\n\nZabljak is a city in the north of Montenegro and the ski resort of the same name. Located in the Durmitor National Park, which is included in the UNESCO World Natural Heritage List. Zabljak is its administrative center.\n\nThe town is located 120 km north of Podgorica. And 180 km from Budva, with which the winter resort has an active passenger flow in the summer season.\n\nIt was the main ski resort in Montenegro during Yugoslav times. Now the leadership is held by a more modern Kolasin.\n\nBut with the transition of the ski leadership, nature itself did not go anywhere. The surroundings of Zabljak are still beautiful.\n\nDistance from the city of Zabljak to:\n\nPodgorica airport – 132 km\n\nTivat airport – 171 km\n\nBudva – 180 km\n\nCities and resorts of Montenegro are losing their original view and atmosphere\n\nIn those days, when tourism in independent Montenegro was just beginning to rise, small towns on the Montenegrin coast looked very different. Beautiful nature, low-rise authentic buildings, free beaches.\n\nThen the money won…\n\nMass construction works started. The rapid growth of the tourist flow. At the same time, more or less suitable areas for expanding settlements on the coast were as limited as possible. As was the beach area.\n\nResult number one – the beaches have become extremely cramped during the season. With all the consequences.\n\nResult number two – popular cities and resorts are losing their original attractive view. Budva has already lost it completely and irretrievably. Many others fly to this at cruising speed.\n\nConstruction is progressing rapidly, even though the free space ended a long time ago. But they keep finding where to shove in subjectively ugly high boxes. Yes, maximally close to the coast. Often obscuring the view of the sea from many small houses located at different distances from the beach.\n\nFor example, Petrovac. Compare what a mainly untouched part of one of the most beautiful towns in Montenegro looks like:\n\nAnd how it looks touched:\n\nAnd here is Przhno. Look how organically the new building is integrated into the existing landscape:\n\nDo you understand the priority of local authorities?\n\nTIP\n\nFind time to visit Montenegro as soon as possible. To catch at least something unbuilt.\n\nExcursions in Montenegro\n\nExcursions in Montenegro are one of the main types of tourism, along with beach tourism. There are a lot of places to see, both on the coast and far from it.\n\nIn the depths of the country, nature is no less delightful than on the coast. High mountains, deep canyons, rivers, glacial lakes. And, of course, historical places.\n\nBus excursions\n\nPerhaps the most popular in Montenegro are bus tours. Usually, it’s group excursions. But there are also individual offers.\n\nAmong the most popular group bus tours in Montenegro, I will note the following:\n\n1. Grand Canyons (by minibus) or Canyons (by macrobus, and one canyon less). And no, the tour covers not only the canyons. If you have the opportunity to visit only one excursion to Montenegro, then this is most likely it. In 2024, the cost of the Grand Canyon tour is €80 for adults and €40 for children. The Canyons cost €55 and €30, respectively.\n\n2. Maxi Montenegro. This is a tour of the Lovcen National Park and its surroundings. The prices of this tour in 2024 are €40 for adults and €25 for children.\n\n3. Heart of Montenegro. Another variation on the theme of Lovcen with its surroundings. Plus a deepening in the sights of the Bay of Kotor. The Heart of Montenegro tour in 2024 costs €55 for adults and €30 for children.\n\nIn addition to the territory of Montenegro itself, there are several options for excursions to neighboring countries.\n\nThe most interesting foreign excursions from Montenegro in 2024:\n\n1. Croatia (Dubrovnik). €50 for adults and €25 for children.\n\n2. Albania (Shkoder) + Old Town of Bar (Stari Bar) in Montenegro. €45 for adults and €25 for children.\n\nSea excursions\n\nIn Montenegro, tourists are offered a huge variety of different sea excursions. From long to very short. On ships of completely different caliber and comfort.\n\nA sea excursion, which is almost mandatory in Montenegro, is along the Bay of Kotor. A wide variety of variations are possible.\n\nAnother popular water excursion is on Skadar lake. In 2024 morning 8h tour costs €55 for adults and €30 for children, evening 5h tour – €45 for adults and €25 for kids.\n\nBoat excursions from local freelancers are also possible. But it is better to use options with at least some testimonials. Better positive.\n\nIndividual excursions\n\nIndividual excursions in Montenegro are noticeably more expensive. Which is predictable. But they are more comfortable. First of all, because you are not rigidly tied to the route and time. Want to stay longer somewhere – just stay. Want to slightly deviate – you are welcome.\n\nWhoever does not offer individual excursions in Montenegro. An obvious risk follows from this – problems with predictability.\n\nIf you didn’t find anybody online or offline, there is a lifehack. Ask the first taxi driver you meet. They also provide excursion services. Prices are about the same. The taxi driver can either propose his own services or advise somebody else.\n\nAnother option is to ask the apartment owner where you are staying. Or at the hotel reception.\n\nIt is best to find out all the available options from different sources. And make a decision based on the results. And what you want to visit depends on how responsibly you study my blog :)\n\nSelf-guided tours\n\nYou can also explore Montenegro by public transport. In Montenegro this option may well be considered when moving along the coast. But you should consider the peculiarity – intercity buses do not run until late.\n\nA taxi can be an addition or alternative to a self-guided tour by bus. This type of transport in Montenegro is quite affordable. But only in case you’ll be doing everything right.\n\nExcursions in Montenegro by car (own or rented) are perhaps the best option. If, of course, it is available to you. But keep in mind that there are many mountain roads in Montenegro. Having no experience of driving in mountainous areas, you can only move along the coast without any problems. In other cases, it is better to think twice.\n\nMontenegro Beaches\n\nAbout Beaches in Montenegro\n\nThere are many beaches in Montenegro. Dry statistics claim that there are 117 of them, with a total length of 73 km. Wet reality says that most beaches are pebble or sand and pebble. There are not so many exceptionally sandy ones.\n\nThe sea in Montenegro is Adriatic. The water is quite salty in terms of comfortable lying on it. The water is clear and transparent except for the most crowded and sandy beaches. Ports and marinas with parking for boats and yachts, as usual, are not the best places in terms of water purity.\n\nEntry into the water is often slightly hampered by pretty large pebbles. It is recommended to take aqua shoes with you to Montenegro. Also, take a mask. Many beaches have something to see underwater.\n\nQuite a comfortable swimming season in Montenegro lasts from mid-May to mid-September.\n\nAlmost all beaches in Montenegro are municipal, with free entry. There is a scheme with renting beaches. Tenants get the right to put paid sun loungers, bars, restaurants, etc. In the package with the rights comes the obligation to keep the beach in proper condition. As a result, the beaches in Montenegro are characterized by two things:\n\n1. They are mostly well-maintained.\n\n2. On popular beaches, the area free from sun loungers is small.\n\nNot all beaches have a complete set of infrastructure: changing cabins, showers, toilets, and lifeguards.\n\nProbably due to problems with English and the need to somehow indicate changing cabins, they start to apply ingenuity*.\n\nHere the faceless part of the description of Montenegrin beaches ends. Now it’s time to list the most significant beaches by name.\n\nList of popular beaches in Montenegro\n\nBeaches are grouped by geographical location.\n\nSlovenska Plaza\n\nSlovenska Plaza – sand and pebble. More pebble. The main beach of the main resort of Montenegro – Budva. One of the rare places in Montenegro where the transparency and purity of water leaves much to be desired.\n\nMogren Beach\n\nMogren beach is sand and pebble (mostly sand) and rocky in some places. The water is clean. This lovely beach near the Old Town of Budva is located in a very attractive place. Consists of two parts – Mogren-1 and Mogren-2, formally separated by a rock.\n\nRecently at Mogren-1, they installed lockers where you can leave your valuables:\n\nIn the summer of 2023, those wishing to relax on Mogren-2 beach could enjoy… a construction site. Some intelligent people decided this small sandy beach was missing this damn nonsense:\n\nBy the way, along with the appearance of the construction, the small bridge in the rock that previously connected Mogren-1 and Mogren-2 has disappeared. Perhaps someone wanted to say: “Don’t come here. We’re working. People are aware”? In July, they finally returned it.\n\nBut what Mogren-2 beach has always needed are certain infrastructure elements – changing cabins, toilets, showers. Do you think all of this will appear in this conglomeration of concrete on the shoreline? And will it flood during the first significant storm?\n\nOld city beach of Budva (Ricardova Glava)\n\nRicardova Glava is a small beach located directly at the city walls. Sand and pebble. Mostly pebbles. The entrance to the sea is a little difficult – pretty large pebbles, slabs, stones. In the high season it is very crowded, and there is almost no space free of sun loungers. Free in September.\n\nPizana Beach\n\nPizana is a little-known small beach near the city walls. The beach coverage is varied – small pebbles, stones, sand.\n\nHawaii Beach on the St. Nicholas (Sveti Nikola) Island\n\nIn my subjective opinion, the best beaches in Montenegro are located on St. Nicholas Island (local name – Sveti Nikola), opposite Budva. Purest water of turquoise shades. Amazing landscapes. Relatively quiet. Great place for snorkeling. The entrance to the water, however, is slightly tricky – pretty large pebbles.\n\nYou need to get to the island by boat. Usually, in the carriers’ announcements and on the boards, the destination is mentioned as the Hawaii beach and not the Sveti Nikola Island.\n\nJaz Beach\n\nJaz is considered one of the best beaches in Montenegro. Located 4 km north of Budva. Mostly sandy. There are some small pebbles. Jaz beach is used to hell parties, concerts and festivals. There is a bus from Budva to the beach, but not too often.\n\nTrsteno Beach\n\nTrsteno is a small sandy beach 6 km north of Budva, not far from Jaz beach. Depth starts far from the shore. Convenient for families with children. The same bus runs from Budva to Trsteno as to Jaz.\n\nPloce Beach\n\nPloce is a small beach 8 km north of Budva. Built in the form of terraces in the initially rocky terrain. The terraces are paved with stone. The entrance to the water is pebbly or by stairs from the platforms. Party beach, foam parties are held. The same bus runs from Budva to the beach as to Jaz.\n\nBecici Beach\n\nBecici is a large, wide, sand and pebble beach next to Budva. In some parts of the beach, there is more sand, in others – pebbles. The pebble is small. One of the best beaches on the Budvan Riviera for families with children. You can walk from Budva to Becici beach.\n\nRafailovici Beach\n\nRafailovici beach is adjacent to Becici beach. Located on the edge of their joint bay. Small, sand and pebble. Smoothly turns into completely pebbly as you move away from Becici. Place of concentration of shops, cafes and bars.\n\nKamenevo\n\nKamenevo is one of the leaders in my personal ranking of the best beaches in Montenegro. Located around the corner from Rafailovici beach. The path lies through a pedestrian tunnel. Kamenevo beach is sand and pebbles. Located in a very picturesque place. The water is purest.\n\nPrzno Beach\n\nPrzno is a small sand and pebble beach (mostly sand) 5 km south of Budva. Suitable for a relaxing holiday.\n\nQueens Beach (Kraljicina plaza)\n\nQueen’s Beach is mostly sandy. Adjacent to Milocer park. In 2023, it was again closed for public access by the leasing company. Only guests of the elite Villa Milocer hotel can use it.\n\nBut in 2021, I found it accessible to everyone. So the impressions, photos, and videos have been preserved in the archive. Queen’s Beach is truly excellent. It’s located in a beautiful place. I liked it much more than the neighboring ‘elite’ beaches – Milocer (King’s Beach) and Sveti Stefan.\n\nBut now, unfortunately, enjoying the splendor of Kraljicina Plaza is impossible. Because money doesn’t smell.\n\nBy the way, it’s not the only Queens beach in Montenegro. Another one is located on the Bar Riviera. So don’t get confused. This one got its name in honor of Queen Maria Karadjordjevic.\n\nMilocer Beach (King’s Beach)\n\nMilocer Beach is also known as King’s Beach. Located 6 km south of Budva, next to the Queen’s beach, in a neighboring bay. The beach is small-pebble. Surrounded by the vegetation of Milocer park.\n\nThe whole story with the royal beaches on this part of the coast is pretty simple. This was the royal residence. On the Milocer Beach, which is larger, the king and his retinue bathed. On the Queen’s beach, which is smaller – the queen herself with her retinue. Hence the names.\n\nStarting from 2023, Milocer Beach has become paid and expensive again. In July, a pair of sun loungers with an umbrella costs €200.\n\nAs a result, the large beach remains empty of people, as only guests of the elite Villa Milocer hotel can use it for free. Let’s give a standing ovation to the local authorities for this wise decision.\n\nBut a couple of years ago, it was different. At the end of May 2021, I discovered Milocer Beach open to everyone. As it turned out, the management company responsible for the adjacent areas had withdrawn from the Montenegrin market. And the beaches were opened. But now, it has returned. Enjoy it, for €200.\n\nBy the way, Milocer Beach is not really special. Its value lies in the beautiful and well-maintained surrounding park with lush vegetation.\n\nSveti Stefan Beach\n\nSveti Stefan is one of the most famous beaches in Montenegro abroad. Located on the Sveti Stefan peninsula, around the corner from Milocer beach. The peninsula of Sveti Stefan with the adjacent beaches is one of the postcard views of Montenegro.\n\nSveti Stefan beach consists of two parts. Both parts of the beach are predominantly sandy, with a small amount of small reddish pebbles. In the area of ​​Sveti Stefan, the lush vegetation of Milocer Park is also present.\n\nThe left side of the beach is accessible to everyone for free. Starting from 2023, the right side again is free only for guests staying in the apartments on the Sveti Stefan peninsula. For others, for example, in July, the entrance fee equals the cost of a pair of sun loungers with an umbrella – €180. By the way, even on the “free” part of the beach, the sun loungers are not cheap either – ranging from €30 for the back rows to €50 for the front row.\n\nIn May 2021, I captured the paid section of the beach open and free for everyone. I even had a chance to swim and sunbathe there in the evening. The beach is decent. However, for €180, you can definitely find a better option to spend money.\n\nPetrovac Beach\n\nCity beach located in a bay. Narrow. Mostly sandy. Plus some small pebbles. Very crowded.\n\nLucice Beach\n\nLucice is a small beach near Petrovac. Located in a beautiful place. Mostly sandy. Pure water. The entrance to the sea is a pebble.\n\nBuljarica Beach\n\nBuljarica is a large sand and pebble beach 2 km south of Petrovac. Part of the beach has the usual beach infrastructure, part is intended for camping. The farthest part of the beach is almost uninhabited.\n\nPerazica Do Beach\n\nPerazica Do is a very unusual beach 2.5 km north of Petrovac. Absolutely not pop. Many people don’t even know about it. On the coastline there are small pebbles, large pebbles and large stones.\n\nAnother “attraction” is the long-frozen reconstruction of the once luxury hotel AS, carefully “built into” the rock.\n\nNotable is the pedestrian path laid from Petrovac along the Health Trail. Those wishing to get to the beach will have to overcome beautiful forest and sea landscapes, as well as 3 tunnels.\n\nCanj Beach\n\nWe got to the Bar Riviera. Canj beach is considered one of the best in Montenegro. This beach is also known as Pearl Coast or Biserna Obala. It’s located in a beautiful bay with clear water. Sand and pebbles, with a predominance of small pebbles. Very crowded.\n\nQueen’s Beach in the community of Bar\n\nAnd here is the second Montenegrin Queen’s beach. It is named after another queen, Milena Vukotic. Located in a picturesque bay adjacent to Canj beach. You can only get there by the water. The beach is mostly sandy, plus a bit of small pebbles.\n\nSutomore Beach\n\nQuite long sand and pebble beach on the outskirts of Sutomore town. There is a little more sand here than pebbles. The beach is quite crowded and cramped. Prices are lower than in popular resorts.\n\nVeliki Pijesak Beach\n\nYou can translate it as a Great Sand Beach. But it is a scam and cheat :) The beach is sandy and pebble. And pebble dominates. Pretty tight. Located between Bar and Ulcinj, in the town of Dubrava.\n\nLadies Beach\n\nAn unusual beach in Ulcinj, located in a small bay. It began to be called Ladies because of the belief that infertility can be cured in its waters. In theory, entry is allowed only for women due to the specifics of the local rituals.\n\nVelika Plaza (Big Beach, Long Beach)\n\nVelika Plaza, without exaggeration, is a giant sandy beach. The longest on the Adriatic coast – 13 km. Wide. And at the same time completely sandy, from the land surface to the water entrance. An extremely rare case in Montenegro.\n\nLong Beach or Big Beach (as it’s known in the English-speaking world) is located in the very south of the Montenegrin coast. It starts on the outskirts of Ulcinj and extends almost to the border with Albania.\n\nDue to the size of the beach, you can always find a free place here. True, often for this you will have to move away or drive away from Ulcinj.\n\nIt starts to get deep far from the shore. Convenient for children.\n\nThere are also a couple of other essential features.\n\nOn Velika Plaza the wind blows almost constantly. Thanks to this, it’s a popular place for kitesurfing and a bit less for windsurfing.\n\nDo not expect to sunbathe here lying on a beach towel right on the sand. The sand is very fine. Its texture is like flour. With the constant wind, your towel, your hair, and everything else will very quickly be covered with fine sand, which is quite difficult to get rid of. So (I don’t believe that I am writing this myself) in the case of Velika Plaza, I definitely recommend taking sun loungers.\n\nAda Bojana\n\nLarge nudist sandy beach located on the Ada Bojana island. The same sandy as Velika Plaza. And now it is already at the very border with Albania.\n\nZanjice\n\nLet’s move to the northern part of the Montenegrin coast.\n\nZanjice is perhaps the best beach in the vicinity of Herceg Novi. Pebble. Clear water, beautiful views, forest. The opposite is the famous Mamula Island, with the remains of fortifications. From the beach, it is convenient to go for a boat trip to the Blue Cave – one of the favorite natural attractions of these places.\n\nSail from Herceg Novi to Zanjice by boat for about 1 hour. You can also sail from Budva. Getting by land is irrational.\n\nPlavi Horizonti (Blue Horizons) Beach\n\nPlavi Horizonti is another completely sandy beach, rare for Montenegro. Nice, but small and too popular for not getting cramped. Located in the bay, surrounded by thickets of olive and pine trees. Scenic paths are laid along the perimeter.\n\nDepth starts far from the shore. Because of this, the water near the shore warms up faster and better. All this makes Plavi Horizonti a great place for a beach holiday with children.\n\nThe beach is most convenient for those who stay in the village of Radovici. Plavi Horizonti is also a pretty convenient option for those who have chosen to stay at Tivat or Kotor.\n\nIt’s most comfortable on Plavi Horizonti at the end of May or the very beginning of June. Later it will be too crowded.\n\nWild beaches\n\nThere are many wild beaches in Montenegro. But not on the Budvanian Riviera. There are too many tourists in this area. So everything that is at least minimally usable in the form of a beach is rented.\n\nAt the same time, small beaches in hard-to-reach bays, with not the most convenient surface, still remain undeveloped. For example, there are many such places in the vicinity of Sutomore.\n\nMany wild beaches are very picturesque. But when visiting them, one should not forget about precautions on land and water. Surrounded by high cliffs, it is worth remembering the possibility of falling stones. There may be sharp rocks and sea urchins on the seabed. And boats can float on the water surface. At the same time, there are no bathing areas fenced with buoys on wild beaches.\n\nNudist beaches\n\nForeign tourists occasionally practice nudism on public beaches. But there are also specialized ones, where a long stay in shorts is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nThe main nudist beaches of Montenegro:\n\n1. Ada Bojana.\n\n2. The beach of the Albatros hotel. On the outskirts of Ulcinj.\n\n3. Cape Ratac. Near Sutomore.\n\n4. Utjeha. Near the town of the same name, in the southern part of the coast.\n\n5. Jaz small beach. Part of the main Jaz beach, hidden from the people’s eyes.\n\n6. Sutorina. On the outskirts of Herceg Novi.\n\n10 best beaches in Montenegro\n\nI did not have the opportunity to visit all 117 beaches in Montenegro. Yes, I agree that it is unforgivable for a travel blogger. Nevertheless, I will still issue my version of the Top 10 beaches in Montenegro.\n\nHawaii Beach on the St. Nicholas (Sveti Nikola) Island – 2 beaches in a far bay\n\nQueen’s Beach (on the Budva Riviera)\n\nKamenevo\n\nMogren\n\nLucice\n\nPerazica Do\n\nPlavi Horizonti (Blue Horizons)\n\nSveti Stefan\n\nZanjice\n\nBecici\n\nPrices for sun loungers and umbrellas\n\nIn the high season, the average cost of a pair of sun loungers + umbrella on the beaches of Montenegro – €15-30. But you can find more expensive. On status beaches like Sveti Stefan and Milocer, even €200 is quite a regular price.\n\nAnd need to notice that on one large beach, like Slovenska Plaza in Budva, there can easily be more than a dozen different tenants. With their own prices and comfort level.\n\nFor example, in one of the less comfortable areas of Slovenska Plaza, you can rent a pair of sun loungers with an umbrella for €12:\n\nAnd in a more comfortable area, you can lounge on mattresses for €30:\n\nIn September, prices may be slightly lower:\n\nAnd at the very beginning of the season at the end of May, prices can be as follows:\n\nTemporarily leaving the beach, leave a towel on the sun lounger. Or some other non-flying object. Or warn the lord of the beach that you will be back. Otherwise, he will gladly sell your place to someone else.\n\nSafety on the beaches\n\nThe beaches of Montenegro are pretty safe. There’s no serious cause for worry.\n\nOf the dangerous marine inhabitants, only sea urchins deserve to be noted. And this is rather in sparsely populated places and on wild beaches.\n\nOf the potentially dangerous animals, only pugnacious homo sapiens from the standard list of countries can be noted. But in Montenegro, you should not expect any special problems even from them. For some unknown reason, even the easily recognizable audience here rarely behaves aggressively. Obviously, according to tradition, Turkey and Egypt, with their All-Inclusive, take the main blow.\n\nOn many beaches, aqua shoes come in handy to protect your feet from slippery and sharp rocks.\n\nRescuers, in theory, can be present somewhere. But it’s better not to rely on them. If there are some independent boats near the beach, in case of emergency, they can help. Despite not being obliged to. But when there are no lifeguards or boats in sight, and there are few or no people, reasonable precautions must be observed. Even if you feel confident on the water. It’s still the sea, not a pool in your backyard.\n\nAll major beaches tend to have swimming areas surrounded by buoys. Within their borders, the probability of getting hit by a jet ski is low. Behind the buoys, the situation changes dramatically. And remember that anyone can rent a jet ski.\n\nThere are no significant problems with theft on the beaches in Montenegro. The situation is much better than in many European countries. The Montenegrins themselves do not do this. It is only worth worrying about visitors and local gypsies. And not too much. But it is still better not to take valuables to the beach or leave them unattended.\n\nTransport in Montenegro\n\nThe main types of transport in Montenegro are buses and taxis. Sea transport is also relevant for tourists.\n\nThere are no domestic flights in Montenegro.\n\nThe main type of transport in the country is the bus. In addition, there is a taxi. Since it is relatively inexpensive, it is often used as a replacement for the bus.\n\nIs Uber or Bolt available in Montenegro?\n\nNo. Unfortunately not. And I wouldn’t expect them to enter the Montenegrin market. Locals don’t like international services interfering in their traditional businesses :)\n\nTo travel around Montenegro with comfort and the necessary flexibility, it makes sense to rent a car. There are a lot of micro rental companies here. Up to those who operate several machines. Large rental companies with a worldwide reputation in Montenegro are not held in high esteem.\n\nRail transport is not developed for tourism purposes, to say the least. There is an international connection only with the capital of Serbia – Belgrade. The only truly interesting route for a tourist is Podgorica-Virpazar-Sutomore-Bar.\n\nThe locals strongly advised me not to use rail transport in Montenegro. They say it’s terrible, buses are better. Of course, I took the advice. And went to get train tickets from Bar to Podgorica.\n\nSummary. Yes, not everything is great there with trains. But overall, you can work with this. Especially in the high season.\n\nMaritime transport is mainly used to meet tourism needs. This type of transport is available in various sizes. From tiny boats carrying short distances to relatively large pleasure crafts. Where it is smaller, the atmosphere can be, let’s say, «unique». With all the ensuing entourage.\n\nIn the past, it was a ferry Bar – Bari (Italy) – Barbados. Now, it seems, available only in transit through the Croatian Dubrovnik.\n\nFood in Montenegro\n\nWhat to Eat?\n\nMontenegro is a reasonably flexible tourist destination in terms of choice of food options on vacation. A big part of the housing for rent is self-catering apartments. Thus, one more option is added to the traditional food in a hotel or cafe, bars and restaurants – self-cooking.\n\nWhere to buy food\n\nIn Montenegro, it is more profitable to buy food in supermarkets. They are not so big in the resort area. But there are also of quite decent sizes by local standards.\n\nIn markets in resort areas, products are usually noticeably more expensive. For tourists. Because they are tourists. The quality is generally good both here and there. Had no cases of expired food in supermarkets.\n\nIt is best to buy pastries in bakeries (local name – Pekara). It is usually tasty in Montenegro. And bakery prices are low. If you need meat, it is better to buy it in butcher shops (local name – Mesara).\n\nYou can buy fruits and vegetables in the outdoor markets or right on the street stalls. But better avoid most crowded places. In supermarkets, fruits and vegetables are different. Sometimes you can find pretty natural. But overall, “industrial rubber” prevails.\n\nFood prices\n\nThere is an opinion that the country, in general, is inexpensive. Therefore the cost of food in Montenegro is low. This is not entirely true.\n\nI compared receipts from supermarkets in Montenegro, Barcelona and Madrid (Mercadona), Venice/Mestre (iN’s). Mercadona is noticeably cheaper on average. And the prices in Montenegrin stores are closer to Italian ones.\n\nWhy is that? Do you remember that Montenegro is an eco-friendly tourist country? Yes, there is little production here. As a result, most products are imported. Much is imported from more expensive countries. Hence the price of products. They are not incomprehensible, but not low either.\n\nCafes, bars, restaurants\n\nMy standard travel format does not involve frequent contact with bars and cafes. And even more so with restaurants. It all takes extra time, which is never enough.\n\nBut I will still give out some generic info.\n\nPortions in Montenegro are usually big. Often one meal can be easily divided into two and eat enough.\n\nAs in other countries, closer to busy tourist spots – higher prices and worse service. When choosing where to eat in Montenegro, the following principle works well. A good rating and many good reviews on Google Maps is a sign of a good catering establishment. As a rule, the details in the reviews were confirmed by the real state of affairs.\n\nEvery place I’ve been to has been delicious. Service varies a lot. Usually, it’s ok. In Zabljak in Konoba Luna – rather funny.\n\nNational Cuisine\n\nThe national cuisine of Montenegro is rich in various meat dishes, fermented milk products (primarily cheese), potatoes and vegetables. There are not so many traditional fish dishes, although they have a sea, lakes and rivers. And seafood dishes are usually quite expensive.\n\nPopular national meals of Montenegrin cuisine:\n\nPljeskavica\n\nVeshalitsa\n\nSacha meat\n\nNegush steak\n\nRazhnichi\n\nChevapi\n\nMešano Me"
