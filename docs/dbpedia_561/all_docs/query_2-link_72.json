        "text": "With all 256 selections of the 2015 NFL draft now in the books, it's time to hand out some draft grades.\n\nThe Buccaneers made the obvious selection in Jameis Winston at No. 1; did they get enough help for him later in the draft? How did the Bills fare with their limited stock of picks? Did the Cowboys land the steal of the draft in Randy Gregory? Will the 49ers regret drafting a punter given the myriad needs elsewhere on the roster?\n\nFind who out who received our highest and lowest marks below, as Chris Burke and Doug Farrar judge each and every team.\n\nJump to your favorite team:\n\nAFC: Bengals | Bills | Broncos | Browns | Chargers | Chiefs | Colts | Dolphins | Jaguars | Jets | Patriots | Raiders | Ravens | Steelers | Texans | Titans\n\nNFC: 49ers | Bears | Bucs | Cardinals | Cowboys | Eagles | Falcons | Giants | Lions | Packers | Panthers | Rams | Redskins | Saints | Seahawks | Vikings\n\nArizona Cardinals: B\n\nThe Cardinals started their draft with a bit of a round 1 steal in Florida offensive tackle D.J. Humphries, who may have gone a lot higher than the 24th pick had it not been for some injury concerns. Humphries has a great combination of strength and athleticism, and he should solidify a left tackle spot that has been problematic for this franchise for decades. Missouri end Markus Golden was lost in all the Shane Ray hype, but he's a hard-working, productive player who can steal a lot of snaps as an all-around defender as opposed to a pure pass rusher. Arizona needed power in its backfield to complement Andre Ellington, and it may now have it in the person of Northern Iowa's David Johnson, a 6'1\", 224-pound thumper who can also catch the ball out of the backfield. West Virginia's Shaquille Riddick is a tweener pass rusher with some potential, though many would have liked this team to take an edge guy in the earlier rounds.​—DF\n\nAtlanta Falcons: A\n\n2015 NFL draft round 1 grades\n\nOnly the Bengals had fewer sacks than Atlanta's 22 last season, and the Falcons went about fixing that issue right away, taking Clemson speed-rusher Vic Beasley with the eighth pick. Beasley put up 12 sacks and 21.5 tackles for loss on the nation's best defense last season, and he's no one-year wonder. He finished with 13 sacks and 23 tackles for loss the year before. He'll make new coach Dan Quinn very happy within Quinn's multiple fronts. The Falcons got a potential steal in the second round with LSU cornerback Jalen Collins, who started just 10 games for the Tigers but looks very comfortable on the field and projects as a physical No. 1 cornerback. Third-round back Tevin Coleman out of Indiana is a pure speedster who can add some real dynamism to a ground game that's been stuck in recent years. But the most interesting late-round pick for the Falcons—and a guy who might be one of the steals of this draft—is Clemson defensive tackle Grady Jarrett, who many had with a second-round grade. He's a highly productive three-tech, and to get him in the fifth round is a gift. Pairing him with Beasley means that the Falcons' formerly dormant pass rush is about to get a lot more interesting.​—DF\n\nBaltimore Ravens: B+\n\nIt was a classic Ozzie Newsome draft, in that the meat of it may come from the mid-round selections. Defensive tackle Carl Davis (No. 90) played like a first-rounder at the Senior Bowl and could be a fixture up front for years if the Ravens can get him to be more consistent. One round after nabbing Davis, Newsome found a powerful edge presence in Kentucky's Za'Darius Smith, and Buck Allen, a running back who looks like a terrific fit for Marc Trestman's offense. Don't sleep on sixth-round receiver Darren Waller either. He was stuck in Georgia Tech's option attack, but at 6'6\" he could be dangerous in the red zone.\n\nOf course, Baltimore also drafted a pair of high-upside pass-catchers early: receiver Breshad Perriman in round 1 and tight end Maxx Williams in round 2. Both were expected to go before the Ravens' picks came up at No. 26 and No. 55. Together, Perriman and Williams add a dangerous downfield element to Baltimore's offense. How rapidly they develop from the talented but unpolished products they are now will determine this group's success.—CB\n\n• Steals, Reaches: Day 1: Giants took who? | Day 2: Ravens nab weapon at TE\n\nBuffalo Bills: C\n\nThe Bills started this draft at a disadvantage, having coughed up their first-round selection to add Sammy Watkins last year. They did well at No. 50 to add a borderline round 1 talent in cornerback Ronald Darby, but it's hard to guarantee any of their other picks will make an impact. Guard John Miller (No. 81) has the clearest shot. Buffalo is thin at guard and Miller, though limited overall, fits the mauler mold Rex Ryan favors. Sixth-round tight end Nick O'Leary was productive at Florida State. Can he find any playing time with two players similar to him in style, Charles Clay and Chris Gragg, ahead of him on the depth chart?​—CB\n\nCarolina Panthers: B-\n\n2015 NFL draft QB wrap-up: Brett Hundley a mere afterthought on Day 3\n\nThe Panthers surprised a lot of people by taking Washington linebacker Shaq Thompson in the first round, with Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis already in the fold. But Thompson is a highly athletic player who covers very well and could even put up a few reps at running back. Second-round pick Devin Funchess is a big-bodied receiver who brings Kelvin Benjamin, last year's first-round pick to mind. Clearly, general manager Dave Gettleman wants to give Cam Newton some very large targets. Oklahoma's Daryl Williams, taken in the third round, is a power blocker who fits this scheme. Texas State linebacker David Mayo could be a nice backup with special teams potential, and fifth-round back Cameron Artis-Payne out of Auburn is a thickly built back who will need to up his urgency to break into Carolina's thin rotation of backs.—DF\n\nChicago Bears: B\n\nWith Brandon Marshall off to the Meadowlands, picking West Virginia receiver Kevin White was the way to go. White isn't as polished as Amari Cooper, but he's got the potential to be a very special player with his combination of size, speed and the ability to make contested catches. Florida State defensive tackle Eddie Goldman gives the Bears the run-plugger they need in the second round, and Oregon center Hroniss Grasu adds toughness and intelligence to John Fox's offensive line. The obvious need for the Bears was at safety, and the pick of Penn State's Adrian Amos should really help. Amos is a smart player who will ease the diagnostic issues rampant in this secondary under former defensive coordinator Mel Tucker.​—DF\n\nCincinnati Bengals: B+\n\nWhile opening with back-to-back offensive tackles (Cedric Ogbuehi and Jake Fisher) was a tad unexpected, it's no secret that the Bengals like to stay in house to replace departing players when they can. Both LT Andrew Whitworth and RT Andre Smith's contracts are up after 2015. Fisher's ready to play now on the right side, if the Bengals want him to; Ogbuehi can take advantage of the tackle depth and ease his way back from a season-ending knee injury. Not sure they needed both guys, no matter how talented they are.\n\nCincinnati addressed a handful of needs from there, starting with TE Tyler Kroft in Round 3. He and fifth-rounder C.J. Uzomah could see tons of snaps if Tyler Eifert is not 100%. LB Paul Dawson, DT Marcus Hardison and S Derron Smith were all relative values where they were selected—Dawson (No. 99) once had Round 1 buzz; Smith (No. 197) was our second-ranked safety. CB/S Josh Shaw might pay off as a value selection, too.—CB\n\nCleveland Browns: B-\n\nTaken on their own, there are some strong choices in Cleveland's draft class. How does it all fit together, though? DT Danny Shelton was a no-brainer for a team that was embarrassed against the run last season. At least he would have been had the Browns not passed on WR DeVante Parker to take him. Vince Mayle (No. 123) is a long way from Parker's skill set, and he was a reach in Round 4 as it was.\n\nIf Shelton can help keep teams from steamrolling this defense, OLB Nate Orchard can seal the deal on passing downs. The picks of Cam Erving (No. 19) and Duke Johnson (No. 77) are interesting. Erving had emerged as a virtual lock for Round 1, but where are the Browns planning to play him? Johnson also will have to battle for playing time, with Isaiah Crowell and Terrance West on the depth chart. The obvious sleeper is seventh-rounder Ifo Ekpre-Olomu. His pre-Rose Bowl knee injury caused a devastating draft slide. He was en route to Round 1 before that setback, so look out if he ever reclaims his old form.—CB\n\nDallas Cowboys: B\n\nNFL draft day 2 marks: Cowboys feel risk worth reward, take Randy Gregory\n\nDallas had a desperate need for better cornerback play, and it stepped up with the 27th pick to select Connecticut's Byron Jones, a workout warrior who did wonders at the combine but looks pretty good on tape, too. Nebraska pass rusher Randy Gregory fell out of the first round due to off-field concerns, but Jerry Jones was ready and willing to grab him with the 60th pick. Gregory has freakish speed, but at 6'5\" and with a playing weight of around 225 pounds, he'll have to put on some bulk to deal with NFL blockers. Dallas signed right tackle Doug Free to a new deal this off-season, which gives third-rounder Chaz Green from Florida time to develop. He could wind up as Free's eventual replacement.—DF​\n\nDenver Broncos: B\n\nThe headliner is Shane Ray, whom the Broncos traded up from No. 28 to 23 to take. Hard to argue with the value there. Ray likely would have gone higher if not for a recent citation for marijuana possession. No other picks necessarily leap off the page, although offensive tackle Ty Sambrailo flashed the potential of a long-term solution. Beyond Ray, the star of Denver's class could turn out to be tight end Jeff Heuerman, who is a better receiver than Ohio State needed him to be. There's a chance he overtakes Virgil Green and Owen Daniels as the starter before too long.​—CB\n\nDetroit Lions: A-\n\nThe Lions have dealt with offensive line issues even as they've established themselves as one of the NFL's more prolific pass-heavy teams in the last few seasons. With their first two picks in the draft, they sought to bring more balance to the Force, so to speak. First-round guard Laken Tomlinson from Duke is a big, smart, aggressive player whose stock has been rising. And Nebraska back Ameer Abdullah is a great fit for Jim Caldwell's scheme as a pure one-cut-and-go runner. Third-round cornerback Alex Carter from Stanford may project better as a safety in the long run. He's a little too slow in his transitions to deal with the best outside receivers. Fourth-round defensive tackle Gabe Wright from Auburn won't make anyone forget about Ndamukong Suh, but he is a reliable rotational player with some production potential. The potential sleeper pick here is Texas cornerback Quandre Diggs, a four-year starter who's the brother of Quentin Jammer and projects pretty well as a slot corner.—DF\n\nGreen Bay Packers: B+\n\nTime for redemption: Shane Ray out to prove his worth to Broncos\n\nWith many needs in their secondary, the Packers chose wisely with the 30th pick. Arizona State free safety Damarious Randall is the prototype at the position in that he can cover deep and come down to tackle. It shouldn't be surprising that he went before Alabama's Landon Collins, who some saw as the best safety on the board. Randall has a better-developed skill set. In the second round, Green Bay picked up Quinten Rollins of Miami (Ohio), one of the more underrated cornerbacks in this class, who probably projects as a slot man at the next level. Third-round receiver Ty Montgomery of Stanford can line up all over the formation, a great fit for Mike McCarthy's multiple offensive schemes. He needs to work on his route development, but he'll get that where he's going. The fifth-round selection of UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley is an interesting one. Hundley passes all the athletic tests, and he's got great mechanics, but he's a couple of years away from being a complete player at the position. Could he be Aaron Rodgers's ultimate backup in time?​—DF\n\nHouston Texans: A-\n\nLoved the work Houston did in rounds 1-3, for the most part. Kevin Johnson is a plug-and-play cornerback, and he buys the Texans wiggle room as Johnathan Joseph heads toward free agency next off-season. Benardrick McKinney is an intimidating presence at inside linebacker, which was a position of need. One nitpick: The Texans really could have used some coverage help next to Brian Cushing, and that's where McKinney is at his worst. Getting wide receiver Jaelen Strong at 70 was robbery. He will not catch 85 passes, as Andre Johnson did in 2014, but he should fly past Johnson's three-touchdown total.\n\nMichigan State receiver Keith Mumphrey and Rice defensive tackle Christian Covington both fall in the \"underrated\" category here. It will be tough for either to make the final 53-man roster, but both guys will go down swinging if they fall short.—CB\n\nIndianapolis Colts: C+\n\nThe Colts caught everyone off-guard at No. 29 with their selection of speedy wide receiver Phillip Dorsett. He is an exciting weapon and a home-run threat whenever he's on the field, but Indianapolis already had Andre Johnson, T.Y. Hilton and Donte Moncrief locked in place at receiver. Sure, sticking to an approach of taking the best player available is generally advisable. The Colts, though, believe they are on the brink of a Super Bowl berth, and it's hard to argue the Dorsett pick got them closer than an upgrade on defense would have.\n\nThose defensive moves did follow. Cornerback D'Joun Smith and defensive end Henry Anderson (both third-rounders) have starter qualities, and safety Clayton Geathers is a nice depth/special teams piece.—CB\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: A\n\nThe Jaguars are coming. Maybe not in 2015, maybe not in 2016, but soon. This draft without question kept this franchise's positive momentum, from a talent standpoint, rolling in the right direction. Jacksonville made one solid decision after another, right through Notre Dame tight end Ben Koyack in round 7.\n\nOpinions varied on this class's top pass rusher, but Dante Fowler was at or near the top of the list, and Gus Bradley can turn him into a star. Running back T.J. Yeldon and guard A.J. Cann should be starters by Week 1, as well. But the real gems here came in rounds 5 and 6, respectively: Florida State wide receiver Rashad Greene, a sharp route-runner and productive performer; and penetrating three-tech tackle Michael Bennett, a remarkable value at pick No. 180.—CB\n\nKansas City Chiefs: B\n\nAssuming the Chiefs keep Marcus Peters in line, that pick at No. 18 will be a boon for their defense. Third-round CB Steven Nelson is a quality player, too, especially if the Chiefs use him in the slot. LB Ramik Wilson (No. 118) brings some depth and young talent to a spot lacking in both. And WR Chris Conley has massive upside, though opinions on his overall value varied a bunch. NFL.com had him as a third-round talent; we had him in the fifth.\n\nThe head-scratcher of Kansas City's weekend: Mitch Morse at No. 49. Morse can play all five positions across the line, so he has serious value. Yet, Andy Reid's claim that Morse would start off competing as the backup center tempers the expectations. A top-50 pick as a backup interior lineman?—CB\n\nJump to your favorite team:\n\nAFC: Bengals | Bills | Broncos | Browns | Chargers | Chiefs | Colts | Dolphins | Jaguars | Jets | Patriots | Raiders | Ravens | Steelers | Texans | Titans\n\nNFC: 49ers | Bears | Bucs | Cardinals | Cowboys | Eagles | Falcons | Giants | Lions | Packers | Panthers | Rams | Redskins | Saints | Seahawks | Vikings\n\n[pagebreak]\n\nMiami Dolphins: A-\n\nPicking at Nos. 14 and 52, the Dolphins essentially wound up landing two first-round talents in wide receiver DeVante Parker and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips. Hard to believe either guy was available at the spot he was picked. Parker was but a hair (if that) behind Amari Cooper and Kevin White at receiver—both those players were gone by No. 7, with multiple teams in need of a playmaker between No. 8 and Miami's spot. Likewise, Phillips had suitors toward the tail end of round 1 (Indianapolis would have been a match).\n\nGuard Jamil Douglas, cornerback Bobby McCain and in particular running back Jay Ajayi all were welcome finds on Day 3. Concerns over a knee issue lowered Ajayi's stock, but he was well worth a round 5 play.—CB\n\nJump to your favorite team:\n\nAFC: Bengals | Bills | Broncos | Browns | Chargers | Chiefs | Colts | Dolphins | Jaguars | Jets | Patriots | Raiders | Ravens | Steelers | Texans | Titans\n\nNFC: 49ers | Bears | Bucs | Cardinals | Cowboys | Eagles | Falcons | Giants | Lions | Packers | Panthers | Rams | Redskins | Saints | Seahawks | Vikings\n\nMinnesota Vikings: A\n\nMinnesota's primary needs were at cornerback and offensive tackle. It dealt with the first issue at pick No. 11 by taking Michigan State's Trae Waynes, a highly physical and aggressive press cornerback. He'll be a perfect bookend for Xavier Rhodes if he learns to deal with crossing routes and avoids a heap of penalty flags. Pitt right tackle T.J. Clemmings dropped to the fourth round due to medical concerns, but if the converted defensive lineman can stay healthy, he might be the best tackle out of this class in a couple years. Second-round linebacker Eric Kendricks should be able to start right away in the middle of Mike Zimmer's defense, while third-round pass-rusher Danielle Hunter from LSU is both freakishly athletic and raw like sushi. He'll need some time with a line coach, but there's a lot to like there. In addition, the Vikings got two much-needed targets for Teddy Bridgewater: Southern Illinois tight end MyCole Pruitt (one of my favorite small-school guys this year) and Maryland speed receiver Stefon Diggs, who can line up all over the place. —DF​\n\nNew England Patriots: B\n\nEveryone knows what to expect from a Bill Belichick draft every year: at least a couple trades, several smart picks and one or two selections that completely fly in the face of conventional wisdom when it comes to player value. Belichick took safety Jordan Richards at least two rounds before he would have drawn heavier interest, then repeated the trick with long snapper Joe Cardona in round 5.\n\nElsewhere, the Patriots landed a bunch of players who should contribute. The 319-pound Malcom Brown will aid a defensive line that lost Vince Wilfork, while third-rounder Geneo Grissom and fourth-rounder Trey Flowers have the versatility Belichick craves on defense. Guard Tre Jackson and C/G Shaq Mason kick in some O-line depth. Mason actually might be the better of the two.—CB\n\nNew Orleans Saints: B-\n\nOf course, we don't know who will be a “reach pick” until things have played out for a couple years, but the Saints took a few prospects who had observers raising their eyebrows. First-round offensive tackle Andrus Peat might be the best pass-blocker in his position group, but with its second first-round selection, New Orleans took inside linebacker Stephone Anthony, who you'd be hard-pressed to call the best inside guy this year. Second-round pass-rusher Hau'oli Kikaha is an outstanding technician who might surprise with his production in Rob Ryan's defense, and Tennessee-Chattanooga outside linebacker Davis Tull might be able to add some pass-rush on a situational basis. The most interesting pick might be Colorado State quarterback Garrett Grayson, who understands a lot of the little things about the position, and will now learn from Drew Brees and Sean Payton. It's tough to imagine a better situation for him.—DF​\n\nNew York Giants: B-\n\nBig Blue's draft started out with a big thud in the minds of some when the Giants selected Miami left tackle Ereck Flowers with the ninth pick. I had seven tackles ranked ahead of Flowers, a powerful run blocker whose pass protection leaves a lot to be desired. Things got a bit better in the second round when the Giants took Alabama safety Landon Collins to beef up their depleted secondary. Collins is a work in progress in coverage, but he'll be an enforcer against the run early. And getting UCLA pass-rusher Owamagbe Odighizuwa in the third round was a bit of a steal. \"Double O\" rushes the passer with bad intentions and a lot of power. Tom Coughlin's team grabbed another safety in the fifth round—Texas's Mykkele Thompson, who plays with range and could be a rotational asset.​—DF\n\nNew York Jets: B+\n\nIgnore the fact that New York did not necessarily need Leonard Williams. The best defensive player, and possibly the best overall player, in this draft fell into the Jets' laps at No. 6, so they did the wise thing and took him. Wide receiver Devin Smith may see limited action this year, but his game-breaking potential deep will help draw attention away from Brandon Marshall, Eric Decker and Jeremy Kerley. Round 3 edge-rusher Lorenzo Mauldin fills a glaring hole on Todd Bowles's defense. No qualms with that pick, though Mauldin is not quite as talented as his Louisville production made him look.\n\nThe Bryce Petty pick at No. 103 no doubt opened some eyes in the Big Apple. Petty won't be a viable NFL starter for some time, if ever, but he still could swipe the QB-of-the-future status from Geno Smith. Ryan Fitzpatrick's presence also buys New York time to bring Petty along.—CB\n\nOakland Raiders: B+\n\nWill the Raiders live to regret passing on Leonard Williams? Not if Amari Cooper is the dominant receiver they believe he can be, but that question will linger into the coming season. Tight end Clive Walford and linebacker Ben Heeney are less variable-reliant scores. Walford was the second-best tight end in this class behind Maxx Williams, and he can run or receive.\n\nThe Mario Edwards Jr. selection at No. 35 will draw mixed reviews. Many NFL scouts were wowed by his physical gifts and upside, while others were more hesitant to go all-in because Edwards was so inconsistent at Florida State. Count us in the latter category for the moment, though Edwards definitely fits a positional need.—CB\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: B\n\nThe Eagles missed the playoffs last season, and defense was the main reason. The secondary, to be specific. And after Philly selected USC receiver Nelson Agholor in the first round (ostensibly to replace Jeremy Maclin), the really wise pick came in the second round with Utah's Eric Rowe, who's played cornerback and free safety at a high level. In the third round, the choice was Texas outside linebacker Jordan Hicks, who could be a pass-rusher in a rotational sense. Then, two cornerbacks from the Sunflower State: Kansas's JaCorey Shepherd (No. 191), and Kansas State's Randall Evans (No. 196). Shepherd, a former receiver, might be the bigger project of the two, while Evans is the more polished player.—DF\n\nPittsburgh Steelers: B+\n\nOf the Steelers' eight draft selections, seven came pretty close to hitting the mark, on paper. The eighth was the third-round choice of WR Sammie Coates, who looks to be almost an exact replica of 2014 fourth-rounder Martavis Bryant. Coates, a raw receiver prospect, is now where Bryant was ahead of last season. Pittsburgh has done well in the past taking WRs around this spot, so perhaps the Coates selection deserves some benefit of the doubt.\n\nBeyond that, GM Kevin Colbert had to upgrade his pass-rush and restock his secondary. Check and check. OLB Bud Dupree goes down as a slight steal at No. 22. CBs Senquez Golson and Doran Grant could earn starting nods. Golson's a ballhawk, Grant a physical presence. TE Jesse James gives the Steelers someone to replace Heath Miller down the road, too.—CB\n\nSan Diego Chargers: B-\n\nSan Diego made just five picks, partly because of a move up to take running back Melvin Gordon at No. 15. Speculation ahead of the draft had Gordon or Todd Gurley in powder blue because of the obvious void at running back, and it’s the former who is San Diego-bound. Gordon's a gem, and he should thrive alongside Philip Rivers.\n\nThe Chargers found talent with each of their remaining four picks (fifth-round outside linebacker Kyle Emanuel's a pass-rushing sleeper). However, one could argue they did not need Denzel Perryman at No. 45. Manti Te'o and Donald Butler are still in tow, though Butler did struggle through an injury-hampered 2014. And a comparable talent to cornerback Craig Mager probably would have been there later. He's a physical specimen but needs to be coached up.—CB\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: B-\n\n49ers general manager Trent Baalke has run the franchise's last few drafts, and he's come out with precious few starters for his trouble. His 2015 draft may be more of the same. First-round defensive lineman Arik Armstead is a freak athlete but is so raw that even head coach Jim Tomsula admitted his new top guy will take some time to adjust. Second-round safety Jaquiski Tartt from Samford was a Senior Bowl sensation, but with Antoine Bethea and Eric Reid in that secondary already, one wonders where Tartt will play. Third-round pass rusher Eli Harold from Virginia may have the best chance to get serious reps right away with his combination of speed and strength. Watch also for Deandre Smelter, a big receiver out of Georgia Tech who should get a good look once he recovers from last December's knee injury. The 49ers seem to understand that their current rebuilding process will take a while, but Baalke needs to improve his hit rate—and soon.​—DF\n\nSeattle Seahawks: B-\n\nSeahawks' Frank Clark selection puts Carroll, Schneider on the defensive\n\nPete Carroll and John Schneider have built up a lot of equity with great pick after great pick since they took over the Seahawks organization in 2010, but they tested a lot of that faith with the second-round selection of Michigan edge-rusher Frank Clark, a third- to fourth-round prospect in the minds of many before you throw in the domestic violence issue that got him kicked off the Wolverines last November. Clark had better be special on the field and perfect off it, because Carroll and Schneider are taking a huge risk here. The move to trade up for Kansas State receiver Tyler Lockett in the third round was better-received, and for good reason. He's an outstanding return man and the kind of speedster who can take the top off a defense—just what Seattle needs. Seattle also took three offensive linemen: San Diego State tackle Terry Poole (who projects as a guard), West Virginia's Mark Glowinski (who might kick inside to center) and Buffalo defensive tackle Kristjan Sokoli, who the Seahawks want to turn into a guard. The guy to watch in Seattle's draft is Towson cornerback Tye Smith, regarded by many as the best small-school pass defender in the 2015 class. He'll get a legitimate shot to crash into the Legion of Boom.​—DF\n\nSt. Louis Rams: A\n\nOffensive line was the primary need for Jeff Fisher's team, and the Rams certainly attacked that need with a vengeance. They took Wisconsin tackle Rob Havenstein in the second round, Louisville tackle Jamon Brown in the third, Iowa tackle Andrew Donnal in the fourth and Fresno State guard Cody Wichmann in the sixth. Havenstein projects as a right tackle, Donnal can move around, Brown might be better as a guard, and Wichmann is a straight-up mauler on the inside. Of course, these gentlemen will be competing for the honor of blocking for the Rams' first-rounder: Georgia running back Todd Gurley, who could be the best overall offensive player in this draft class if his ACL injury isn't a lingering issue. If new quarterback Nick Foles can live up to his potential, the Rams will be a very dangerous team this season.—DF\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: B\n\nThe top pick in the 2015 NFL draft, Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston, will either be a franchise-defining stroke of genius or a franchise-defining disaster, depending entirely on whether Winston can channel his estimable talent and keep his head straight. The Bucs did give Winston some important on-field protection with second-round tackle Donovan Smith (a 6'6\", 328-pound mauler from Penn State) and Hobart's Ali Marpet (a former tackle who looks like a really good guard in the NFL). Also, adding to big targets Vincent Jackson and Mike Evans, Tampa Bay took Nebraska burner Kenny Bell in the fifth round and slot man Kaelin Clay from Utah, an underrated player with gliding speed.—DF\n\nTennessee Titans: B\n\nWho knows if this all will come together, or when it might come together, or who will be the coach and general manager when it does, but the Titans' offense became massively more intriguing over the course of 48 hours. Tennessee drafted seven offensive players in all, of course the most notable being quarterback Marcus Mariota. Not everyone is sold on Mariota's upside. We had him as the No. 2 player in this class, so put us on the opposite side of the fence.\n\nRuston Webster then added talented-but-troublesome wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham, G/T Jeremiah Poutasi, running back David Cobb, center Andy Gallik, do-everything fullback Jalston Fowler and closed the draft by somehow landing wide receiver Tre McBride at 245. All of those guys could be starters down the line, including McBride.\n\nUnfortunately for Webster, his defense is still shy several players. Neither of the Titans' two defensive picks (tackle Angelo Blackson and outside linebacker Deiontrez Mount) are even in the vicinity of being sure things.—CB\n\nWashington Redskins: B\n\nNew general manager Scot McCloughan made it clear in his first Washington draft that he's going to do with the Redskins what he did in his stints with the 49ers and Seahawks: fill the roster with height/weight/speed monsters who can play the game. Some may question taking Iowa tackle Brandon Scherff with the fifth pick, but he's a perfect right tackle or guard who could fill in should left tackle Trent Williams get hurt. Second-round end Preston Smith from Mississippi State can play all over the formation. He's not a speed-rusher, but he can do just about everything else. Third-round back Matt Jones from Florida is a huge (6’2”, 231) inside runner, and fourth-round guard Arie Kouandjio (the older brother of Bills tackle Cyrus) is a bruising guard with a lot of potential. Arkansas cornerback Tevin Mitchel is one to watch over time: the 6’0”, 183-pound four-year starter will need some time with an NFL coaching staff, but he has all the measurables.—DF\n\nJump to your favorite team:\n\nAFC: Bengals | Bills | Broncos | Browns | Chargers | Chiefs | Colts | Dolphins | Jaguars | Jets | Patriots | Raiders | Ravens | Steelers | Texans | Titans"
