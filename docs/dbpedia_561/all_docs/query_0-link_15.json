These texts, including numerous diplomatic despatches of the British Foreign Office, deal initially with the Albanian uprising against Ottoman rule in the spring of 1912 and, in particular, with the period of the Serbian invasion of Kosovo in late 1912 and the repercussions of the conquest for the native Albanian population. The documents from 1918 to the early 1920s focus mainly on endeavours by Albanian leaders, including those of the so-called Kosovo Committee in exile, to bring the plight of their people to the attention of the outside world, endeavours which largely failed. Further documents reflect the situation in Kosovo up to World War II. This collection does not claim to constitute a full documentary history of Kosovo in the period in question, but it does hope to provide the interested reader with much information, largely unavailable up to now, on many of the major and minor events that channelled and determined subsequent happenings, including the Kosovo War of 1998–9 and the declaration of independence in February 2008. The editors are grateful for the support of Selim Pacolli. A word of thanks also goes to the National Archives in Kew (London) for use of the many archival documents presented in this book, and to the Mabetex Company in Prishtina for funding to cover the printing costs of this book.

It is the seventh and probably last state to arise from the ruins of former Yugoslavia. It is also one of the poorest countries in Europe. Kosovo’s long struggle for identity, self-determination and independence has been bitter, and the country will be in need of international ­assistance for a while before it can become a normal European nation like the others. For centuries, Kosovo, also known as Kosova, was part of the Ottoman Empire, and for most of the twentieth century, it was a province of what was once Yugoslavia. After the military conflict in 1998–9 and a period of administration by the United Nations, Kosovo declared its independence from ­Serbia on 17 February 2008. Land and People Kosovo is situated in the southern interior of the Balkan Peninsula in south-­ eastern Europe, between 43°16´ and 41°47´ of latitude north, and 20°00´ and 21°47´ of longitude east. It is a landlocked, square-shaped country of 10,877 square kilometres, about the size of Montenegro, Northern Ireland or the US state of Connecticut. Kosovo’s surface area is less than half of that of Albania, having a north–south distance of about 147 kilometres and an east–west distance of about 152 kilometres. The country borders on the Republic of ­Albania to the west, the Republic of Montenegro to the northwest, the ­Republic of ­Serbia to the north and east and the Republic of Macedonia to the south. Settlements in Kosovo are concentrated primarily on two central plateaux stretching in a north–south direction. The eastern part of Kosovo, known geographically at the Plain of Kosovo (Alb. Fusha e Kosovës, BCS Kosovo Polje), is a plateau running from Mitrovica southwards past Prishtina and Ferizaj almost to Kaçanik. It has an elevation of 500–600 metres. Western Kosovo, known geographically as the Dukagjin Plateau or Metohija (Alb. Rrafshi i Dukagjinit, BCS Metohija), is a plateau running from Istog and Peja in the north down to Prizren in the south. It has an elevation of 300–500 metres.\n\n01_Introduction.indd 1\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:48\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History Kosovo has a population of almost 2 million people, roughly equivalent to that of Macedonia or Slovenia. It is inhabited primarily (to about 92 per cent) by Albanians, the same Indo-European people as in the neighbouring Republic of Albania. There are also minorities of Serbs, Bosniacs, Roma and Turks. The Serbs, though now only 5 per cent of the population, played an important role in Kosovo’s history and held political power throughout most of the twentieth century. The main languages spoken in Kosovo, accordingly, are Albanian, used by about 92 per cent of the population, and BCS (Bosnian–Croatian–Serbian), commonly known here as Serbian, used by about 6 per cent of the population. English and German are the best-known foreign languages. History Kosovo has fixed and recognized borders, but until 2008 it never constituted an independent state of its own. In the first millennium ad, it was part of the Roman Empire and later fell to Byzantium. In the period 1184–1216, it came under the rule of the Serb Nemanja dynasty from neighbouring Rascia (Raška) and formed an integral part of the medieval Serb Empire. The famed Battle of Kosovo of 1389 marked the beginning of Ottoman expansion into Kosovo. By the year 1455, all of the country was under Turkish rule and was to remain under the sway of the sultans until the early years of the twentieth century. The late ninteenth century saw the rise of the Albanian nationalist movement that crystallised in the League of Prizren in 1878. This League took over Kosovo and governed it until 1881, when it was quashed by Ottoman troops. From that time until the end of Ottoman rule, or better misrule, uprisings in Kosovo were a matter of course. Yet the Albanians, who were by this time the majority of the population, were hesitant to cut all ties with the Ottoman Empire for fear that Serbia might invade and take over the country. In October 1912, this is exactly what happened. Kosovo under Serb Rule As the Ottoman Empire crumbled, leaving Kosovo in a state of anarchy, the Serb army under King Peter invaded from the north and occupied all of Kosovo. Hideous massacres, recorded in the chronicle Albaniens Golgatha (Albania’s Golgotha), Vienna 1913, by Austrian Socialist Leo Freundlich, were committed against the Albanian population. Village after village was razed to the ground, with the inhabitants being bayoneted or burned alive. The Serbs of Kosovo, for their part, welcomed the army of King Peter as liberators, and liberated they were. The Conference of Ambassadors, meeting in London from December 1912 to August 1913 to discuss events in the Balkans, confirmed the independence 2\n\n01_Introduction.indd 2\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:48\n\nIntroduction of Albania itself, but agreed to recognize Serb rule over Kosovo, thus excluding 40 per cent of the Albanian population in the Balkans from Albania itself. It was a tragic mistake that haunted the Balkans right to the end of the twentieth century. Kosovo was under Serb rule for over 80 years, throughout which, from start to finish, it had a large Albanian majority population. The people of Kosovo were never consulted as to whether they wished to be part of Serbia, and they did not. Had there been a free and democratic referendum on Serb rule at any time from the military invasion of 1912 to the withdrawal of Serb forces in 1999, the population of Kosovo, in its overwhelming majority, would undoubtedly have said “No, thank you”. Thus, although the inclusion of Kosovo in Serbia and Yugoslavia was largely recognised internationally, it lacked basic democratic legitimacy. As a consequence of this, although regimes in Belgrade changed over the decades (royalist, communist, democratic), one constant factor was dictatorship, and often military dictatorship in Kosovo. It could never be otherwise because anything Belgrade had to offer was fundamentally against the wishes of the people of Kosovo. Vociferous claims emanating from Belgrade that Kosovo was “part of Serbia” were not unlike protests in France in the 1950s that Algeria was not a colony but “part of France”. In neither case were the people of the territory in question ever consulted. The history of the Kosovo Albanians from the beginning of Serb rule in 1912 to its very end in June 1999 is one of tragedy and unspeakable injustice. Had there been any semblance of national and minority rights for nonSlavs in the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, things might have been different. The Kosovo Albanians, as non-Slavs and as Muslims in their majority, were looked upon from the start with great suspicion and were deprived of basic rights. Books and school education in Albanian remained as illegal as they had been under Ottoman rule, and very few Albanians ever gained positions in government administration. The 1920s saw the rise of official Yugoslav government campaigns, some of them very violent, to depopulate Kosovo of its original inhabitants and to colonise it with peasants and farmers from Serbia and the Vojvodina. In September 1920, a “decree on the colonisation of the new southern lands” facilitated the takeover by Serb colonists of large Ottoman estates and of land seized from Albanian rebels. By 1925, the government colonisation programme, which had brought some 70,000 colonists to Kosovo, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the total population, had raised the proportion of Serbs there from 24 per cent in 1919 to 38 per cent. In June 1931, a new Yugoslav law “on the colonisation of the southern regions” entered into force and, in 1933, the Yugoslav government began negotiations with the Turkish government for the deportation of the Muslim population to Turkey. By 1935, an orchestrated wave of confiscation of land from Albanians was well underway. The culmination of prewar projects for the 3\n\n01_Introduction.indd 3\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:48\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History ethnic cleansing of Kosovo can be seen in a chilling paper presented to the Serb Academy of Sciences in Belgrade on 7 March 1937. Its author, Vaso Čubrilović, a noted Serb scholar and political figure of the age, called for nothing less than the expulsion of all Albanians from their native Kosovo. By 1939, there were about 60,000 Slav colonists in Kosovo, equivalent to 9.3 per cent of the population. It is no wonder therefore that Kosovo Albanian sympathies were divided at the time of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. Although there was no particular enthusiasm for the new Axis administration, most Kosovo ­Albanians found it preferable to Serb rule. In the autumn of 1941, Italian forces occupied and annexed most of Kosovo, which, under Benito Mussolini, was finally, though briefly, reunited with Albania. It was during the Italian and German occupation that the tables turned for the Serb and Montenegrin colonists in Kosovo, who, for the most part, were driven back out of the country, not without terror and violence. An estimated 20,000 Serbs and Montenegrins fled for their lives in the spring and summer of 1941, many being deported to forced labour camps or to work in the Trepça mines. Kosovo Albanian historians assert that the Albanians drove out only the new settlers and ­ colonists who had earlier taken their land, and, generally, did not attack the traditional Kosovo Serb communities whom they regarded as their neighbours. In 1943–4, however, under the Albanian nationalist Second League of Prizren, there was general terror against the Serbs and Montenegrins, and about 40,000 of them had been driven out of the country. Fascist rule and the reunification of Kosovo with Albania were shortlived. By the end of November 1944, all of Kosovo had fallen into the hands of the victorious Yugoslav partisans, and had been returned to Serb administration. Tito’s communists originally promised to let the people of Kosovo decide democratically as to whether they wished to be part of Albania or of ­Yugoslavia. Tito, however, soon reneged on his promise, realising that the so-called “Marxist solution” to the Kosovo question would never be accepted by Serbia. Kosovo was thus incorporated into socialist Yugoslavia against its will, under the law of 3 September 1945. It was, nonetheless, recognised as an “autonomous region”. Relations with neighbouring communist Albania under Enver Hoxha were initially very good, but by 1949, in the early years of the Cold War, they reached an all-time low. In order to keep power and to counterbalance Yugoslav influence in his tiny and impoverished country, Hoxha aligned ­ ­Albania with Stalinist Russia. Claims on Kosovo would only have destabilised his rule. The border between Albania and Kosovo was thus closed and became as impervious as any communist border could be. Even in the mid1990s, long after the fall of communism in both countries, Kosovo Albanians still required special exit visas to visit Albania, which were usually denied. Yugoslav communism brought the Kosovo Albanians a modicum of rights as citizens, but as an ethnic group they were still deprived of full equality. 4\n\n01_Introduction.indd 4\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:48\n\nIntroduction ­ articularly difficult were the years of Aleksandar Ranković (1909–84). As P Tito’s right-hand man, Ranković was initially Serb minister of the interior and, from 1953–66, was deputy prime minister. He despised and mistrusted the Albanians and made sure that his police and security forces kept them under strict control. The infamous and ludicrous campaign for the collection of arms in 1956 was so rigorous that Albanian families, faced with savage beatings and prison, were forced to buy weapons (from the Serb police) in order to give them up (to the Serb police). The whole country breathed a sigh of relief when Ranković was purged in 1966. The Brioni Plenum of July 1966 marked the beginning of a substantial improvement in the lot of the Kosovo Albanians. In March 1967, Tito paid a visit to Kosovo. In 1969, official usage of the pejorative term for the ­Albanians, šiptar, was banned in favour of the neutral term albanac. The founding of the University of Prishtina in February 1970 gave the Kosovo Albanians something essential that they had always been denied: access to higher education in their own language. Within one short decade, a new elite of professors, doctors, lawyers and educated political figures arose to give leadership and direction to the country for the first time. In February 1974, the new constitutions of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Kosovo accorded the autonomous province a status virtually equal to that of the republics in the Yugoslav federation. Though still under Serb tutelage, Kosovo could now manage most of its own affairs. It had its own parliament, its own police force and its own national bank. Run by local Albanian communists, Kosovo was equally represented with the six republics and the Vojvodina in the federal presidency. And the Albanians won the right to fly their own national flag. In many ways, the period from 1967 to 1981 marked a “golden age” in the history of Kosovo. There was a semblance of equality among all citizens, and a nascent spirit of fraternity showed that Albanians and Serbs could indeed live together. After years of nationalist contestation, the two communities began to work together for a common good. Economically, however, Kosovo made little progress and this, in the long run, proved to be its downfall. Despite its rich mineral resources, it remained by far the poorest and most underdeveloped region of Yugoslavia. In 1979, it had an average per capita income of US$ 795, as compared to the Yugoslav average of $2,635 and to $5,315 in Slovenia. The initially peaceful protests of March and April 1981 and the brutality of their suppression by the Belgrade authorities brought this “golden age” to a definitive close. What began as student demonstrations at the University of Prishtina, to protest against miserable living and studying conditions, soon transformed themselves into a political movement for republic status and absolute equality with the other parts of the Yugoslav federation. Kosovo had always been denied the status of a republic because this would have given it the legal right to secede from the federation, something to which the Serbs 5\n\n01_Introduction.indd 5\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:48\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History were fanatically opposed. Belgrade dubbed the unrest “counter-revolutionary” and imposed a state of siege. The troubles, which spread throughout Kosovo as an uprising against Serb rule, were swiftly and brutally squashed when the federal police and the army were brought in from Serbia and elsewhere. Thousands of Albanians, apprehended in mainly peaceful demonstrations, were sentenced to long years of prison for counter-revolutionary and separatist activity. The people of Kosovo were in shock. So was Yugoslavia. The year 1981 marked the beginning of the gradual Serb takeover of Kosovo. The situation for the Kosovo Albanians got worse every year throughout the 1980s. The population grew sullen and angry, and tried its best simply to ignore the Serb state. The people knew that they were powerless to oppose the might of Belgrade. In the autumn of 1988, after several years of silence and withdrawal, there were once again major demonstrations against Serb rule, this time when ­Slobodan Milošević dismissed Albanian political leaders without the ­endorsement of the local communist party. On 18 November, factory ­workers, students and children joined the miners of Trepça in a 100,000-strong ­peaceful march on Prishtina. In February of the following year, the miners went on a widely publicised hunger strike that shook the population to its core. The protest movement was again put down by force, and thousands of people were arrested. In April, in Ferizaj alone, over 1,000 workers were put on trial. Belgrade showed no intention or interest in settling Kosovar grievances. On the contrary, the Serb leadership decided to resolve the Kosovo ­question by openly depriving the Albanians of their economic existence, that is, by starving them out and forcing them to emigrate. A process of “differentiation” was introduced, by which tens of thousands of Albanians lost their jobs and livelihood. Virtually all Albanians were fired from management and government positions under the pretence that they were not loyal to the Serb state, and indeed, they were not. Deprived of their jobs, many of them had no choice but to flee abroad in search of work in Germany and Switzerland. ­Belgrade had reverted to the strategy it had used successfully in the 1930s: ethnic cleansing – though in the 1980s still in a discreet form. With hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians seeking refuge abroad, the international community now began to take note of the Kosovo question for the first time. On 28 March 1989, the parliament in Belgrade for all practical purposes rescinded the autonomy status of Kosovo. The population was once again in shock. By June, when Slobodan Milošević fuelled the nationalist sentiments of the Serb minority with his speech at Gazimestan near Prishtina to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, the country was on the verge of civil war. Events of 1990 made it evident to everyone that there was no turning back from the brink. In March of that year, the Serb parliament invoked the ­infamous “Programme for the Attainment of Peace, Freedom and Prosperity 6\n\n01_Introduction.indd 6\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:48\n\nIntroduction in the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo”, which provided financial assistance to Kosovo Serbs and forced even more Kosovo Albanians to leave the country. The screws were turned and the pressure mounted. In April and May 1990, thousands of Albanian school children were taken to hospital suffering from stomach pains, headaches and nausea. The Serb authorities spoke of mass hysteria, whereas the Albanian population suspected poisoning. Indeed, subsequent analyses carried out by a United Nations (UN) expert on toxicology revealed the presence in the children’s blood and urine samples of the toxic substances Sarin and Tabun, which were being manufactured and utilised by the Yugoslav army at the time for chemical weapons. In May 1990, an amendment to the Serb law on universities made the use of “minority languages”, i.e., Albanian, illegal at institutions of higher education in Kosovo. On 26 June, most provincial competencies were then taken over “temporarily” by Serb government and administrative authorities by virtue of a new law on the “Activities of the Institutions of the Republic under Exceptional Circumstances”. Finally, in July 1990, Serb forces intervened physically by breaking up and abolishing the parliament and the government of Kosovo. They also shut down all Albanian-language media. There was no more semblance of representative government, no more radio, no more television, not even a daily newspaper. In the autumn of that year, the authorities then closed down virtually all Albanian-language schools and educational institutions, firing ­ teachers and professors. Some 1,835 doctors and nurses were also expelled from hospitals and medical facilities, many of them forcibly. The Kosovo Albanians were aware that they were outnumbered, and outgunned. There could be no course of action but passive resistance, a political strategy propagated from the start by their leader Ibrahim Rugova. With time, under the Democratic League of Kosovo, they created their own parallel state structures, including a government (in exile), a state president, a parliament, schools and a modicum of social assistance for the population, supported primarily by the 3 per cent tax paid by Kosovo Albanian workers abroad. On 2 July 1990, 114 of the 123 members of the parliament of Kosovo, meeting in the street outside their locked assembly building, declared Kosovo to be an “equal and independent entity within the framework of the Yugoslav federation”, that is, a Yugoslav “Republic of Kosovo”. On 7 September of that year, at a secret assembly in Kaçanik, they promulgated a new constitution for the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo was to be a sovereign state among the other nations of Yugoslavia. A year later, on 22 September 1991, this parliament proclaimed the independence of the “Republic of Kosovo”. In a national referendum held on the issue on 26–30 September 1991, 99.86 per cent of voters (with an 87.01 per cent turnout) approved the move. An official government in exile was set up in Germany under Prime Minister Bujar Bukoshi and, in May 1992, Ibrahim Rugova, still living in Prishtina, was elected president of the unrecognised and thus essentially fictive state. 7\n\n01_Introduction.indd 7\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:49\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History In the following years, international mediators pleaded with the Kosovo Albanians to avoid any further escalation of the conflict, and promised to address their grievances as soon as the Bosnia conflict was under control. However, Kosovo was excluded from the Dayton Agreement of November 1995, and no international mediators returned to Prishtina to fulfil their promises. Between 1993 and 1998, the level of oppression exerted on the Kosovo Albanians was unprecedented in Europe since the Nazi period. With no solution in sight, it was only a matter of time before organised armed resistance became a reality. The population realised increasingly that the long years of passive resistance under Ibrahim Rugova had led them nowhere. In April 1996, the underground Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), founded in ­December 1993, began carrying out coordinated attacks on persons representing and collaborating with the Serb state. It made its first public appearance at a funeral in Drenica on 28 November 1997 and soon enjoyed massive support. The Kosovo War broke out in the early months of 1998, when Serb troops began a major offensive in the Drenica region, attacking the villages of Çirez and Likoshana. Soon thereafter, the Kosovo Liberation Army issued a communiqué calling on all Albanians to join the fight against the Serb regime. By the end of May, one-quarter of the territory of Kosovo was a war zone, and much of it was under KLA control. Militarily, the KLA and the local population initially did quite well in combating Serb forces. In the summer of 1998, however, a new Serb offensive reversed the Albanian gains of the spring, and by October, the KLA was in disarray and agreed to a cease-fire. Despite this, fighting continued and intensified throughout the winter. Kosovo first received major international attention in January 1999 with the discovery, by a delegation of the Organization for Security and ­Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) under William Walker, of the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians in Reçak (BCS Račak) massacred by the Serb police. Last-minute peace talks were held in France in February and March, but to no avail. The Serb side refused to sign the peace accord, thus making intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) inevitable. NATO forces began their bombing campaign over Yugoslavia on 24 March 1999. In revenge, the Belgrade authorities launched a well-prepared and well-orchestrated campaign to “cleanse” Kosovo of all of its Albanian population. Over half a million people were put to flight, most of them being expelled or taking refuge in Albania and Macedonia. The NATO bombing campaign lasted until mid-June 1999 when the parliament in Belgrade finally agreed to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo. Serb rule had come to an end. Kosovo under United Nations Administration In early July 1999, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe set up a mission in Kosovo that would be known as the United Nations 8\n\n01_Introduction.indd 8\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:49\n\nIntroduction Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and French politician Bernard Kouchner was appointed as Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to oversee the new administration. By August, 850,000 ­ Albanian refugees had returned to Kosovo, and about half of the Kosovo Serb population, some 100,000 people, had fled to Serbia. A transitional council of representatives of all ethnic communities, including the remaining Serbs, was called together in August. By the autumn of 1999, political parties had been formed, and an Interim Administrative Council began to function in early 2000. On 28 October 2000, local elections were held, the first free elections in Kosovo’s history. The majority of the populace voted for the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) under Ibrahim Rugova. Parliamentary elections ­followed a year later, on 17 November 2001, with the LDK once again the leading party, but without an absolute majority. Parliamentary life thus resumed on 10 December 2001 with the first ­session of the new Kosovo Assembly. On 28 February 2002, Bajram Rexhepi was elected prime minister, and Ibrahim Rugova subsequently assumed the title of head of state. A new multi-ethnic Kosovo Police service was created, and the KLA was demobilised and transformed into the Kosovo Protection Corps. Thereafter, UNMIK gradually began transferring most of its administrative competencies in Kosovo to the elected government authorities. A sudden outbreak of ethnic rioting and anti-Serb violence occurred in mid-March 2004, the worst since the Kosovo War. The events, sparked by a series of relatively minor incidents and inaccurate media reporting, ­subsided almost as quickly as they arose, but they left in their wake shock and much destruction, in particular of Serb homes and churches. The initially unchecked rioting proved just how fragile the reconciliation progress was, and how ineffective KFOR was in ensuring public order. The parliamentary elections of October 2004 were held under the supervision of the new central electoral commission. They resulted in a coalition between the LDK and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), making Ramush Haradinaj prime minister. Haradinaj, a former hard-line KLA leader, did much for the Serb community and promoted reconciliation, but he was forced to resign in March 2005 when he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. After a lengthy trial, he was acquitted of all charges. Haradinaj was followed in office by Bajram Kosumi of the AAK who resigned the following year, in March 2006, and was replaced by another former KLA commander, Agim Çeku. The year 2006 also marked the death of President Ibrahim Rugova, who was succeeded as head of state by Fatmir Sejdiu. The Road to Independence The burning question for most people in Kosovo during the years of international administration was the country’s final status. United Nations Security 9\n\n01_Introduction.indd 9\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:49\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History Council Resolution 1244, adopted on 10 June 1999 at the end of the Kosovo War to provide for a legal international presence in the country after the ­withdrawal of Serb forces, set forth that there would be a political process to determine Kosovo’s final status, taking into account the Rambouillet accords. The United Nations and the international community had long not been willing or able to come to terms with the issue of final status and endeavoured to postpone any discussion of it as much as possible. In April 2002, Special Representative Michael Steiner launched the slogan “Standards before ­Status” to try to convince the population of Kosovo that there was no sense in addressing the status issue until certain standards had been achieved. Steiner’s objective was both to postpone a thorny discussion of Kosovo’s status and, at the same time, to prepare Kosovo as a functioning democracy with respect for minority rights and an operating market economy to meet future requirements for independence and/or for membership in the European Union (EU). In 2005, Norwegian envoy Kai Eide reported to the United Nations that there was no advantage to be gained by stalling the status process. In ­November of that year, when a Contact Group (France, Germany, Italy, ­Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) had set forth the “­ guiding principles” of status resolution, that is, that there would be no return to the situation before 1999 and that there would be no change in Kosovo’s ­borders, i.e., no partition of Kosovo or union with a neighbouring state, and had agreed that any future status would have to be acceptable to the people of Kosovo, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed the former president of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, as his special representative to lead the status process. Ahtisaari brought Prishtina and Belgrade together for further negotiations on practical issues and on the status question, and then drafted a comprehensive proposal for status resolution. The so-called Ahtisaari Plan recommended independence, subject to a period of international supervision under an International Civilian Office (ICO). Prishtina accepted the proposal, but Belgrade rejected it. On 3 April 2007, Martti Ahtisaari submitted his plan to the United Nations Security Council for approval. Due to Russian opposition, however, the ­Security Council was not able to reach agreement on it, and yet further negotiations were recommended, this time under the auspices of a “Troika” (EU, Russia, US) which was to report to the secretary-general in December 2007. After intense negotiations held in Baden, near Vienna, the Troika reported the obvious, that it was not possible to find a mutually acceptable agreement. Meanwhile, parliamentary elections had been held once again in ­November 2007 and resulted in a victory for the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) under the new prime minister, Hashim Thaçi. The Serb minority largely boycotted these elections. On 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia and, at the same time, committed itself to respecting its obligations under the ­Ahtisaari Plan, to embracing multi-ethnicity as a fundamental principle 10\n\n01_Introduction.indd 10\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:49\n\nIntroduction of good governance, and to welcoming a period of international supervision. Most Western countries and most members of the European Union recognised Kosovo shortly after the declaration, and the Dutch diplomat Pieter Feith was appointed as the first International Civilian Representative (ICR) and European Union Special Representative (EUSR) to Kosovo. The EU also agreed upon a European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) to oversee police work and judicial affairs. In line with the Ahtisaari Plan, the government of Kosovo enacted laws on minority protection, decentralisation, special protection zones for Serb cultural and religious sites, local self-government and new municipal boundaries. Parliament also approved a new constitution which entered into force on 15 June 2008, having been certified by the ICR as a modern constitution that “provides comprehensive rights for members of communities as well as effective guarantees for the protection of the national, linguistic and religious identity of all communities”. In December 2008, EULEX reached its initial operative capacity with the deployment of over 1,000 international police officers, judges, prosecutors and customs officers. At the same time, UNMIK substantially scaled back its presence. It was initially foreseen that UNMIK would withdraw from Kosovo upon the arrival of EULEX, but Russia opposed this. By April 2009, EULEX had achieved full operational capacity. In June 2009, Kosovo joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a step that finally enabled it to acquire much-needed external capital in the form of grants, emergency financing and project funding. Quo Vadis, Kosovo? After almost nine decades of misrule under Serbia and almost a decade of United Nations administration and unclarified status, Kosovo is now the newest country in Europe. According to surveys taken in the year of independence, it had the youngest and most optimistic population on the continent. The declaration of independence in February 2008 was a moment of pride and joy for the Kosovo Albanians and most other ethnic communities, although it was, admittedly, also one of great apprehension for the Kosovo Serb minority. Reconciliation will take time, and independence is only one step in an arduous process of nation-building. The new Republic of Kosovo still faces substantial challenges and will need to rely to a large extent on the support of the European Union and the international community for many years to come. Among the major problems Kosovo is confronted with is the economy. As one of the poorest countries in Europe (only Moldova is poorer), Kosovo imports great quantities of goods and services but exports by ­comparison very little. Its catastrophic balance of payments is only kept on an even keel by i­nternational support and financial remittances from Kosovars living 11\n\n01_Introduction.indd 11\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:49\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History abroad. About 35 per cent of its citizens live below the poverty line and about 15 per cent live in extreme poverty. The Kosovo Serbs, who make up only 5 or 6 per cent of the population but who are still very influential, do not identify with the new State in which they live and continue to look to Serbia as their only country. The result of this stance is that the government of Kosovo does not have effective control over all of its territory. The much-lauded and unquestionably needed Ahtisaari Plan in fact only served to reinforce the division of the country. Another major problem is Kosovo’s tenuous relations with the neighbouring, and much larger, Republic of Serbia. Although it accepted the independence of Montenegro with little opposition, Serbia has not taken ­ kindly to the independence of Kosovo. The Belgrade government bitterly opposed the ­“unilateral” declaration, but had no alternative to propose that would have been acceptable to the people of Kosovo. Emotionally, most Serbs still regarded Kosovo as theirs and theirs alone, and there was a­ nti-Western rioting in Belgrade when leading Western countries recognised Kosovo’s ­ ­independence. The declaration was controversial on the international scene as well. Most Western countries recognised Kosovo within a couple of months of the act, but some countries, such as Russia, threw their support behind ­Serbia. Even within the European Union there was no unanimity, and a few EU member states – with minority problems of their own – withheld ­recognition. Finally, Kosovo also has a substantial image problem. Its name has conjured up images of ethnic conflict, eternal political crisis and organised crime. It has been decried, primarily by Belgrade but also in some international reports, as a mafia state and as a haven for drug traffickers and criminals. While it is undeniable that crime and corruption exist in Kosovo, as they do in most countries with a similar level of economic development, the rampant human trafficking and unchecked organised crime that flourished in the early years of the UNMIK administration have been largely dampened. Kosovo is, in fact, a very safe country to visit. According to a report of the Kosovo Stability Initiative, the murder rate is about the same as in Sweden and there are more police officers per capita than in Singapore. By comparison, Northern Ireland has 960 per cent more violent crimes and there are almost four times more firearms per capita in Finland than in Kosovo. Despite this, much remains to be done to consolidate structures and to improve the country’s image. At the time of her surreptitious journey to Ottoman Kosovo in 1908, the intrepid English traveller Edith Durham wrote: “There is a joy that never palls – the first glimpse into the unknown land. On the other side of the pass, a magnificent valley lay below us, thickly wooded with beech, and beyond were the lands which two rival races each claim as their birthright – one of the least-known corners of Europe”. Kosovo has long been the meeting place between the two “rival races”, the interface between Albanian and Serbian 12\n\n01_Introduction.indd 12\n\n18-12-2017 14:10:49\n\nIntroduction worlds, and this confrontation has indeed often – though not always – been a source of irritation. The country’s dual identity is now being overlaid by a strong European dimension. If Kosovo and the other countries of southeastern Europe can be swiftly assisted towards integration and membership in the European Union, sovereignty and border issues will fade and soon become irrelevant. The former president of Germany, Roman Herzog, once said on a visit to the southern Balkans, “Let us keep the borders where they are, but let us stamp them into the ground so that no one can see them”. The day will soon dawn, it is to be hoped, when the political and emotional ­borders that separate Albania, Kosovo and Serbia will be no more significant than those between France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The often sombre past will be nothing more than … the past.

British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] 10 March 1912 to H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G. &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica\n\nSir, I have the honour to report that the itinerary of the Minister of the Interior detailed in my despatch No. 12 of Feb. 29 has so far been adhered to. The Minister left Prishtina on the 3rd inst., Mitrovitza on the 5th, Ipek [Peja] on the 8th, and is now at Jakova [Gjakova]. His reception everywhere has been cold, indeed the Ipek Albanians sent him a message to Mitrovitza telling him not to visit Ipek at all, but there has apparently been no attempt at violence. At Prishtina, the original plan of holding the Mevlud service on Kossovo Polye was abandoned, as it was evident that the Albanians would not turn out for it. No one came to receive his sweets except the local Committee of sympathisers and a few Albanians of no position or importance. In spite of all this, the Minister telegraphed to the Porte from Ipek that he had had an excellent reception. A number of rumours of disturbance have been current here, one even that the Minister had been forced to abandon Jakova and travel from Ipek to Prisrend via Mitrovitza and Ferisovich [Ferizaj], though groundless they are interesting as showing what is considered possible. While in Uscub the Minister offered a bakhshish of £T 5 to each of the Medressé teachers, some refused, other incurred some unpopularity by accepting. The only reforms I have as yet heard of are an exchange of Kaimakams between Kyoprulu [Veles] and Prishtina and the dismissal of a high police officer in Uscub. The prevailing impression is that the object of the tour is not reforms but Committee propaganda. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, /signed/W.D.

Consul General Salonica Sir, With reference to the Reform Tour of the Minister of the Interior, and in continuation of my despatch No. 15 of Mar. 10, I have the honour to report that there are no details to add to the account of the attack on the Minister between Dyakova and Prisrend, which I reported to H. M. Embassy in my telegram No. 3 of the 11th inst. The Minister before leaving Prisrend made arrangements with the Lyuma tribe who inhabit the north slopes of the Shar Planina to escort him as far as the boundary of Scutari [Shkodra] vilayet. His reception at Prisrend was no more enthusiastic than at other places in the province. With the exception of some party propaganda and the reforms mentioned in my despatch No. 15, I have been unable to find that he has done anything in this province partaking of the nature of performance as opposed to promise.

Consul General Salonica Sir, As I had the honour to report to H. M. Embassy in my telegram No. 4 of to-day, the Minister of the Interior and his party were ambushed by Albanians in three places near Vezir Kyöprü [The Vizier’s Bridge] while on their way from Prisrend to Scutari [Shkodra]. Of the Albanians, one was killed and four wounded, of the Minister’s escort four soldiers were killed and six wounded, also Halid Bey, acting Kaimmakam of Lyuma, and Mehmed Efendi, hoja of Sirot, were slightly wounded, and Ali Efendi, commandant of gendarmerie in Lyuma, had his horse shot under him. The aggressors are unknown, but are not improbably of the Lyuma clan, who have either broken the “bessa” made by their chiefs with the Minister, or more probably do not consider it binding on them. The authorities are somewhat reticent about these regrettable incidents, and it is only to-day that the news of the affray reached me. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, /signed/W.D. Peckham Vice Consul [FO 195/2406] Despatch from British Vice-Consul W.D. Peckham in Skopje to British Consul General Harry Lamb in Salonica, dated 24 April 1912, on Krasniqja rebels in Gjakova and Ura e Fshajt in Kosovo. British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] 24 April 1912 to H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G. &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica Sir, In confirmation of my telegram No. 5 of the 20th inst. to H. M. Embassy, I have the honour to report that some five hundred Albanians of the ­Granichi [Krasniqja] clans have subverted what little exists of Turkish authority in 18\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 18\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nDocuments Djakova [Gjakova]. Two battalions of infantry and two batteries of artillery were sent against them from Prisrend, but were repulsed at Ura Fshayt [Ura e Fshajt]. The Prisrend troops were subsequently reinforced by a battalion from Uscub, but have done nothing further, and I hear that the reinforcing battalion has been sent to Lyuma. The bulk of the Albanians are waiting the results of the elections, which have not yet finished in this province. It appears that the loyalty of the local troops is not entirely to be depended on, if called out to quell a rising in Albania.

British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] 28 April 1912 to H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G. &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica Sir, In confirmation of my telegram No. 7 of to-day’s date to H. M. Embassy, I have the honour to report that I had an interview this morning with H ­ assan Bey, whose re-election as deputy for Prishtina the Turkish Government is opposing by every means, legitimate or otherwise. Hassan Bey assured me that the whole of Albania was sick of the present government, which he described as barbarous and brainless, and intended to revolt. The immediate intention was, he said, to demand the annulment of the recent Parliamentary elections throughout Turkey and the appointment of a non-party Cabinet under Kyamil Pasha, containing men like Tevfik Pasha and Nuradugian Efendi, to hold new elections which shall really express the will of the people. Failing this, they will demand autonomy for Albania. I enquired what form this would take. He aspired to complete fiscal and military separation and to an Albanian republic whose connection with the Porte should be merely nominal, but did not appear to have a cut-and-dried 19\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 19\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History programme of the minimum which would be accepted. He cited the parallel of Bulgaria and the growth in Bulgarian population since the Treaty of Berlin. The suzerainty of the Porte would be accepted. I pointed out that the Albanian clans had not on previous occasions shown much national cohesion, and instanced the Malissor outbreak of last year, but he assured me that there was now a complete organization from Skodra to Yannina, though he offered no proof except possibly the agreement with Greece hereafter mentioned. There has, I believe, been a growth of ­nationalist spirit in Albania latterly, and I have heard of a general organization from other sources. Passing to the military side, he told me that the Dyakova outbreak reported in my despatch No. 29 would be the kernel of the movement, that the ­Malissor and other Gheg clans would concentrate on Tuzi and that the movement would rapidly spread south and embrace the Tosks. Uscub would have fallen within a week of the first move and they would be in Salonica in a month. I remarked that I could well believe that there was an adequate supply of small arms in Albania, but what were they going to do about artillery? He replied that they had none at present, but relied on capturing Turkish, which plenty of Albanians knew how to work, the same applied to the Engineer arm. They had money in hand for a month’s campaign, if not more, and relied on outside financial support if the matter was not settled by then. They did not count much on the support of the Macedonian Bulgars or their method of harrying the country with bands, but were willing to join hands with them and extend their demand to autonomy for Rumelia, in which not merely the Three Vilayets but also Skodra and Yannina should be included. I pointed out that any disturbance in Turkey reacted on ­ neighbouring states, and cited the rumours of the Austrian move on Tashlija (see my ­despatch no. 12, postscript), also the effect on Greece of the East ­Roumelian revolution of 1885. He admitted this, but stated that they had come to an understanding with the Greek Government and the Greek Macedonian ­Committee, and also with the Bulgarian Macedonian Committee, but not with the Bulgarian Government. Montenegro was negligible, the Malissia being an Albanian stronghold. Bulgaria and Servia would be held in check by Austria, and Austria herself would, he hoped, abstain from interference, realizing that this was a purely internal matter, and would leave the Ottoman peoples to fight it out among themselves, but at worst Austrian rule would be preferable to Turkish, though the most desirable of all would be British. What he asked for was the political support of the British Government, and if need be their financial support later on. I gather that he has not approached any other Consul here, and hopes that the British Government will take the lead in any concerted action necessary. I assured him that I would at once communicate his request to my superior authorities and let him know the result. 20\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 20\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nDocuments I asked him what they were waiting for before they revolted. He replied, nothing but the answer of H.M. Government. At the same time, an unfavourable reply would not avert the revolt. Throughout the interview Hassan Bey manifested considerable optimism, this was, I think, the optimism of a man who feels that things cannot be worse, and may well be improved by strong measures. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, /signed/W.D. Peckham Vice Consul [FO 195/2406] Despatch from British Vice-Consul W.D. Peckham in Skopje to British Consul General Harry Lamb in Salonica, dated 14 May 1912, on Ottoman troop movements towards Gjakova. British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] 14 May 1912 to H. H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G. &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica Sir, With reference to the Embassy telegram No. 4 of yesterday, I have the ­honour to report that after spending some time in fruitless negotiations with the Albanian insurgents at Dyakova [Gjakova], mentioned in my ­despatch No. 29 of the 24th ult, the Ottoman authorities appear to have decided on energetic action and the following troops have been despatched from Uscub: — the 19th Nishanji battallion, 1 machine gun company, 2 mountain (gun companies) batteries, 1 transport company, a small number of cavalry (20 men) and 2 companies of field artillery (8 guns). One infantry battallion (56/1) has been sent from Kumanova and one, whose number I have been unable to get, from Prisrend. The total strength of these reinforcements is given as 1,200 men. The Commandant of the VII Army Corps, Ismail Fazil Pasha, has himself left for the scene of operations, and Dyakova is, I hear, almost completely surrounded. The general revolt prophecied by Hassan Bey of Prishtina, as reported in my despatch No. 31 of April 28 has shown no signs of coming into ­existence, though I have lately heard of disorders at Ipek [Peja] and Gossinye [Gucia/Gusinje], where 3,000 Albanians are said to be in revolt. 21\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 21\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History With reference to the second paragraph of above-mentioned telegram, I have the honour to report that I have no news of Ihtiats being moved up here since my despatch No. 21 of Mar. 27, but I have just heard that a Redif ­Battalion has arrived from Smyrna. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble servant /signed/W.D. Peckham Vice Consul [FO 195/2406] Despatch from British Vice-Consul W.D. Peckham in Skopje to British C ­ onsul General Harry Lamb in Salonica, dated 29 May 1912, on signs of an antiOttoman Albanian uprising in Kosovo. British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] 29 May 1912 to H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G. &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith Dislocation List of the VII Kol Ordu. The Nishanji Battalion of the 1st Nizam Division, some 500 strong, passed through here on the 26th inst. The Albanian chiefs are reported to be at Volnyak [Volljaka], near the ­confluence of the Beli Drin and the Mirusha (Banyes). Negotiations with the Government are proceeding, but I have no trustworthy information as to their nature, nor have I yet received any copy of Ismail Kemal Bey’s manifesto. (see my despatch No. 36 of the 24th inst.). An incident reported to-day from Ferisovich [Ferizaj] may, if true, be of some importance for the conduct of these negotiations. Nine battalions, most, if not all, belonging to the 1st Nizam Division, were ordered to Prisrend. Hereon one Hassan Chaoush of Brusa [Bursa] made a speech to the soldiers saying that though prepared to go anywhere or fight anything they would not bear arms against their Albanian compatriots. This sentiment met with the approval of the soldiery, who delegated Hassan Chaoush to convey their views to their officers. This story, the sequel to which I have not heard, tends to confirm what I have already had some reason to believe, namely the change in the old 22\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 22\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nDocuments habit of unquestioning obedience produced by the admission of non-Turkish ­soldiers into the army. Another confirmation is the frequency of desertions to the Albanian side. An Albanian notable of Gilan informs me that the Albanians east of the Uscub-Mitrovitza line will rise as soon as the revolt becomes general in Ipek [Peja], Dyakova and Prisrend, but not before. He also states that the present negotiations are being prolonged by the Albanians to gain time to get arms, not more than forty per cent of them being properly armed at present. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, /signed/W.D. Peckham Vice Consul [FO 195/2406] Despatch from British Vice-Consul W.D. Peckham in Skopje to British Consul General Harry Lamb in Salonica, dated 7 June 1912, on more signs of an antiOttoman Albanian uprising in Kosovo. British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] 7 June 1912 to H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G. &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica Sir, I have the honour to report that an encounter took place on the 3rd and 4th inst. between the Albanian insurgents, said to have numbered seven ­thousand, and two divisions (firka) of the Ottoman troops in the neighbourhood of Yünik [Junik], which however the Albanian chiefs had already left. The Turkish troops were successful and the Albanians retired to Belaye (Bare in the direction of Gussinye?). The Ipek [Peja] Albanians have passed the somewhat ill-defined line which separated unrest from rebellion, and are reported to have burned the Konak in Ipek. On the 3rd inst. some 1,500 Ihtiats from Ishtib and Radovishta passed through here to fill up gaps in the forces in Albania. The rumour of the fall of Dyakova [Gjakova] town reported in my ­despatch No. 38 of the 3rd inst. is untrue. 23\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 23\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, /signed/W.D. Peckham Vice Consul [FO 195/2406] Despatch from British Vice-Consul W.D. Peckham in Skopje to British Consul General Harry Lamb in Salonica, dated 29 June 1912, containing an Albanian manifesto against the Young Turk authorities. British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] June 29, 1912 to H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica Sir, In confirmation of my telegram No. 11 of today to H. M. Embassy, I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of an Albanian manifesto which has been sent to a local newspaper for publication. The publication of this document, which does not even demand the fall of the party which it execrates, is probably due to the desire of the Albanians to secure the co-operation of the Army officers here, some eighty per cent of whom are said to be hostile to the Committee, but probably unwilling to help a professedly separatist movement. The Albanians all along have protested that the accession of the Opposition to power would completely satisfy their demands. A recent Army Order published here enjoining abstention from political action met with little response save a curt comment that it should have been published at election time. I have, so far, no news of any desertions here similar to those reported from Monastir, but it appears that a great deal of sedition is being talked both among the officers and the rank and file.

The Albanians are, and always will be, firmly attached to the Caliphate and the Ottoman Fatherland with a fidelity which nothing can shake. If they have raised the flag of revolt it is not simply in the interests of Albania, but to save the Fatherland from the fearful pit into which it has fallen. Let no ­Ottoman entertain any doubt of this. The Albanians have taken up arms because they see that the Young Turk Government and the accursed and execrable policy which it follows will end sooner or later in a hostile invasion of the virgin soil of the Fatherland, because they see that a few ignorant upstarts are sending the great ­Ottoman Empire along the road to ruin with the speed of lightning, because they know that where there is no reason and no instruction, logic and persuasion are incapable of getting right done, because finally they realise the absolute necessity of certain laws in accordance with local needs. Everyone knows that the present government tramples underfoot the laws of our sacred Constitution and arrogates to itself the right to interfere in the most illegal and incredible manner in the Parliamentary elections which are one of the most sacred rights of the nations. The deputies in consequence are not to-day the representatives of the nation, but functionaries whose business it is to execute the unjust orders of the Government. We have acted in the way that we have because we interpret the actions of the Government during the last four years against our sacred Constitution as so many attacks on the rights of the nation, as so many reactionary measures, because we feel that this government’s line of action impels this poor country to ruin, and in order to defend the interests of all the Ottomans and assure the establishment of the Constitution. We do not wish our action to be interpreted otherwise, and we protest against and reject any other interpretation with all our might.

Peckham in Skopje to British Consul General Harry Lamb in Salonica, dated 9 July 1912, summarising the situation in Kosovo. British Vice Consulate Uscub [Skopje] 9 July 1912 to H. Lamb Esq. C.M.G. &c., &c., &c. H.B.M. Consul General Salonica Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith an attempt I have made to ­summarize the Albanian situation as it exists at present. Unfortunately, rumour and opinion enter into this far more largely than is desirable, owing to the incurable optimism of the Albanians and the impossibility of getting official news here. I shall give references to previous despatches by date and number in the margin. The province south of the Shar and the Kara Dag (Tsrna Gora), i.e. the Sanjak of Uscub and the Kaza of Kalkandelen [Tetovo], appears unaffected. I am unable to trace any connection between the Albanian insurgents and the Macedonian Komitajis. Hassan Bey’s agreement with the Macedonian Organization appears to have done him no good so far. I have no news from the Sanjaks of Senitza [Sjenica] and Tashlija [Pljevlja]. The Sanjak of Ipek [Peja] appears still to be the centre of disturbance in this province, the Dyakova Albanians have been continuously in revolt since April, and for the last month at least reports of guerrilla warfare from the neighbourhood of Dyakova have been coming in from time to time. The Albanians of Ipek, always turbulent, and irritated during the last six months by the indiscreetly Chauvinistic rule of Jaffer Tayyar Bey, have joined the movement heart and soul. Prisrend Sanjak is not officially in revolt, but doubtless a number of ­Prisrend Albanians have joined the insurgents. The Sultan’s writ never runs in Lyuma Kaza, the Kaimmakam of Lyuma normally residing at Prisrend as a sort of governor in partibus infidelium, and the Minister of the Interior himself had to make a “bessa” with the Lyuma chiefs in order to pass through. As the Lyuma have virtual autonomy it is doubtful how far they will bestir themselves to help other clans in a revolt against a government which is nominal in their case.\n\n26\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 26\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nDocuments The future of the movement depends largely on the attitude of the Albanians of the Sanjak of Prishtina. On the whole they are more law-abiding than the Western clans, the railway having brought them some material prosperity, while facilitating movements of troops to overawe the discontented. A month ago I was assured that they would not rise till the whole west of the province was in revolt, but since then there have been indications that the revolt is spreading to Mitrovitza and Vuchitrn, and even as far as Preshevo, though the latter seems to have been an isolated raid. It should be remembered that several of the leaders are East-Albanians. Hassan Bey is identified with Vuchitrn and Prishtina, Isa Boletin’s village is close to Mitrovitza, while of the nineteen signatories of the ­Albanian manifesto no less than twelve are from Prishtina Sanjak. The main ­ grievances against the Government – the schools question and the action of the G ­ overnment during elections – are common to both sides of the province, and if Jaffer Tayyar Bey has not made his baleful influence felt in Prishtina Sanjak there is the local grievance of the hair of the Prophet’s beard. A rising in Prishtina Sanjak would probably isolate the Turkish troops at Mitrovitza by cutting the railway above Kachanik, and might even succeed in capturing that pass or turning it by way of Preshevo and Kumanovo. (There is rumour current here that the Kumanovo battalion, 56/I, is to be sent back from Albania for this very reason.) Hassan Bey’s boasted Albanian organization has not proved very effective in this province. It has failed to bridle the enthusiasts of Dyakova till their slower and worse armed brethren in the East were ready. I have repeatedly asked “If the Albanians mean a general revolt, why do they wait while the Turks bring up troops to crush the partial revolt existing?” The answer has almost invariably been “They are not yet sufficiently armed.” The ­unsuccessful attack on Ipek at the beginning of June doubtless had the magazine for its objective. (Unfortunately I took it for granted that there was an adequate supply of small arms in Albania when Hassan Bey expounded his schemes to me). For this reason I tend to note with particular care ­captures of arms and desertions of men with arms. I have recently seen a letter of Hassan Bey’s in which he states that, up to date, they have captured eight hundred and sixty-eight rifles and two cannons (this includes Skodra Vilayet). The Turkish authorities, at any rate till the recent desertion at Monastir, seem to have taken a confident view of the situation. They deliberately preferred that Hassan Bey should denounce the Committee from Yünik ­ [Junik] rather than from the Opposition benches of the Chamber, and their masterful handling of the elections has provided leaders and a war-cry for a people only too inclined to take to the hills as soon as the snow has melted enough.\n\n27\n\n02_Documents (1912–1945).indd 27\n\n18-12-2017 14:08:29\n\nKosovo, A Documentary History On the military side, their movements have been calculated and deliberate, they raised their regiments here to full strength before the revolt had assumed more than insignificant proportions, and were evidently confident that they had the revolt well in hand, since till the last few days I have had no occasion to report the passage to troops since the beginning of June. They seem even to have ignored the pacific demonstrations of Hassan Caoush of Brousa [Bursa], nor have I heard that his discourse has produced any practical results. Two things have recently tended to modify this view of the situation: the desertions in Monastir and Salonica vilayets, and the Albanian manifesto. The zeal with which they have suppressed the latter, and their previous forged manifesto demanding autonomy make it probable that they wish to ­confuse hostility with the Committee with hostility to the Ottoman Empire, and recalls similar ingenious adaptations "
