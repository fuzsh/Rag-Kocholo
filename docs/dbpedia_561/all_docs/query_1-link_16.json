Through this program, you will develop a specialty within the built environment through the lens of practice.\n\nOur program will challenge you to think creatively and critically as you address design problems on various scales. You will synthesize ecological, technological, social, behavioral, and aesthetic contexts and constraints into healthy, sustainable human and natural environments.\n\nApply Download Program Flyer Request More Information\n\nAbout the Program\n\nThe Master of Architecture is an accredited degree that prepares students to practice architecture on a professional level.\n\nThe field of Architecture synthesizes ecological, technological, social, behavioral, and aesthetic contexts and constraints into healthy sustainable human and natural environments. The graduate program provides an opportunity to examine the past, equip for the present, and prepare for future challenges in Architecture.\n\nOur Master of Architecture program lets students explore a range of professional directions related to faculty expertise. Our faculty’s breadth and depth of knowledge allows students to engage with the discipline of architecture at an impactful level.\n\nFaculty members encourage students to develop their own individual course of study, blending architectural design; history, theory, and criticism; design computation; and interior architecture. You will complete your education by creating a final study design project with a strong scholarly basis. Your final study project will exhibit a clear understanding of the integration of both the discipline and practice of architecture.\n\nAreas of Emphasis\n\nHousing and Urban Development\n\nHealth Systems and Design\n\nHeritage Conservation and Historic Preservation\n\nSustainability and Circular Economy\n\nDigital Fabrication, Robotics, and Computation\n\nLeadership and Management in the Design & Construction Industry\n\nRecent Graduate’s Final Study Projects\n\nEl Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua are border cities that share many living condition qualities. Both cities are divided by a highly protected border that consists of physical and natural barriers such as the Rio Grande River and the current wall.\n\nKarla Padilla ’22\n\nView Karla’s Master Thesis\n\nReintroducing the public bath house to the American Society focuses on the important historical role of this typology in addressing public health and well being.\n\nUran Sokoli ’21\n\nView Uran’s Master Thesis\n\nThe world of art and creative expressions is where my passion in life resides.

This webpage will provide you with an opportunity to review estimated cost of attendance information for undergraduate, graduate and professional students, as well as other resources such as the tuition calculator and billing and fee explanations.\n\nWho can I go to for questions?\n\nAll inquiries about the Master of Architecture program should be directed to magarner@tamu.edu.\n\nSupport from the Start\n\nYou’ll be assigned an academic advisor upon admission to the program. The advisor will help choose your first-year courses. With guidance from the program coordinator, you will be responsible for locating a faculty member to chair your advisory committee who has expertise in your chosen focus area. Once your committee is in place, they will guide and assist with graduate degree planning, research methods, and thesis work.\n\nOur Commitment to Our Students\n\nWe are committed to delivering a 21st-century, student-centered education to all of our students. We weave diversity, inclusivity and critical thinking throughout all of our courses. We view design, both as a process and a product, as the unifying force within our program.\n\nStudio Culture Procedures\n\nNAAB Statement on Accreditation\n\nUniversity Accreditation: Texas A&M University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges & Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, master’s and doctoral degrees. Degree-granting institutions also may offer credentials such as certificates and diplomas at approved degree levels. Questions about the accreditation of Texas A&M University may be directed in writing to the Southern Association of Colleges & Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097, by calling (404) 679-4500, or by using information available on SACSCOC’s website. See the 2023-2032 reaffirmation letter from SACSCOC here.\n\nProgram Accreditation: In the United States, registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit professional degree programs in architecture offered by institutions with U.S. regional accreditation, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may require a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture for admission. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.\n\nThe Texas A&M University Department of Architecture offers the following NAAB-accredited degree program(s):\n\nMaster of Architecture (pre-professional degree + 55 graduate credits)\n\nNext accreditation visit for all programs: 2031\n\nAbout the Texas A&M architecture programs\n\n2023 NAAB Accreditation Visiting Team Report for Department of Architecture at Texas A&M University (PDF)\n\n2022 Texas A&M Architecture Program Report (PDF)\n\nPrevious/ Additional Accreditation Reports\n\nAPR PART II.4 Public Information\n\n2020 NAAB Conditions and Procedures for Accreditation\n\nAccreditation Reports and Related Documents\n\nArchitecture Program Report for the last Visit (2023)\n\nNAAB Decision Letter (2023)\n\nPlan to Correct since the last team visit\n\nVisiting Team Report (2022/2023)\n\nInformation on Career Development\n\nThe NCARB Handbook for Interns and Architects (July 2022)\n\nStudio Culture\n\nThe Emerging Professional’s Companion\n\nNCARB\n\nAIA\n\nAIAS\n\nACSA\n\nPublic Access to APRs and VTRs\n\nThe Architecture Program Report (APR) and Visiting Team Report (VTR) from the previous accrediting visit may be found on reserve in the Department of Architecture or online here.\n\nARE Pass Rates\n\nThe most recent data on Architecture Registration Exam (ARE) pass rates for graduates of the M. Arch Program may be found on reserve in the Department of Architecture.\n\nGeneral Disclosure\n\nNotice to students pursuing programs that may lead to a professional license or certification required for employment.\n\nThe following programs may lead to a professional license or certification that is required for employment. Professional licensure/certification requirements vary from state to state, which may affect a student’s ability to apply for a professional license/certification upon the completion of the program. The U.S. Department of Education regulation, 34 CFR 668.43 (a) (5) (v), requires an institution to disclose whether the program will fulfill educational requirements for licensure or certification for each state. The administrative departments that offer the programs have made the following determination regarding their curriculum.\n\nPlease note that American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau (represented by the abbreviations AS, MH, FM, and PW) are not incorporated territories and do not have any licensing or certification educational requirements for the practice of Architecture. We recommend students contact the appropriate state licensing agency in their state or the state where they intend to work to seek the most up-to-date information about state licensure/certification requirements before beginning the program.\n\nPertinent information related to the importance of licensure in architecture can be found at https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/basics\n\nAdditional information for architectural licensure by state and territory can be found at https://www.ncarb.org/get-licensed/licensing-requirements-tool\n\nView profile\n\nAhmed K.
