        "text": "It's clear that LeBron James, the best basketball player of the 21st century, started (and will continue to start) the debate of whether he or Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of all time, based on his underrated characteristics: durability and consistency.\n\nThere hasn't been an NBA season since 2003 in which LeBron wasn't a significant figure, and you'd have to go back seven years to find a season in which he didn't play in the Finals.\n\nI almost feel sorry for those who still don't want to hear anything beyond \"JORDAN IS THE BEST EVER AND LEBRON IS A CRY BABY\" because this debate will only get louder as LeBron collects more awards and their relentless denial of LeBron's status and the existence of a stronghold for someone who retired two decades ago will only seem increasingly illogical and hysterical.\n\nThe relentlessness of LeBron's career epitomizes the cumulative effect he has on his opponents over the course of 48-minute games and seven-game playoff series. He is such a tireless, unique and fierce force of nature that he eventually wears people down, drains them like juice and grinds them into powder.\n\nIf Jordan can be compared to lightning, because of his speed, brilliance and the ability to dazzle people with brilliance, then LeBron is a tsunami - a deadly phenomenon with the body of Karl Malone, the skills of Magic Johnson, the reflection of Julius Irving and the brain of Bobby Fisher.\n\n(When it comes to the Jordan-LeBron debate, I could type out 3 more words, but I'll try to keep it simple. Michael Jordan was the perfect basketball player. His near-perfect skill set allowed him to be such a transcendental virtuoso that lifted the teams he was in. played, like the sun that provides light for the entire galaxy. LeBron, on the other hand, has the game and the body and the brain to play the perfect basketball. His moves aren't as fluid, his game isn't as sexy as Jordan's, but he doesn't have those things that he can't physically execute and mentally process and that's the dynamic that allows him to make the best move in almost every basketball situation. He's not a star, nor the sun, nor a planet. He's gravity. In a vacuum, Jordan is a better basketball player, but LeBron's skills make him more effective.I choose efficiency).\n\nCertainly, while the debate about their talents and play, and ratings of basketball greatness remains relevant, there is no debate that the 32-year-old LeBron far surpassed both the 32-year-old Jordan and the now 54-year-old Jordan in terms of integrity and courage.\n\nCan you imagine Michael \"my arms are too short to fight Republicans who also buy sneakers\" Jordan (a reference to Jordan's famous reason for not endorsing a Democratic candidate in the 90s) holding a press conference the night before the NBA Finals and says:\n\n\"This just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America. The hatred in America, especially towards African-Americans, lives on. It's hidden most days. But it's alive every day. I think of Emmett Till's mother (the boy who was lynched in 1955 ) and the reason she kept the casket open, she wanted to show the world what her son experienced in terms of hate crimes in America. No matter how much money you have, how famous you are, how much people admire you, being black in America is difficult\".\n\nThis, of course, was LeBron's response to having \"nigger\" written on the fence of his house.\n\nInstead of refusing to comment and dismissing it as a distraction, which would have been perfectly justified given the timing and explosive nature of the incident, he used his position and influence to remind America (and the world) of the disease that permeates the bones and blood vessels of so many people. LeBron may be the world's most famous athlete, a soon-to-be billionaire, and has access to numerous privileges and power. But to many Americans, to too many Americans, he's still just a nigger. Like Emmett Till.\n\nThis is far from the first time LeBron has spoken about race, or education and injustice. But I can't remember when his words were so clear, pure and relevant. And for him to say something like that, while the sports world is engaged in a debate about him and Michael Jordan, says a lot. Even LeBron himself admitted that this thought is in his head, that he is chasing a ghost, the ghost that played in Chicago. But as we ask whether he has done enough to merit the comparison, we may be asking the wrong question.\n\nMaybe LeBron shouldn't be like Mike. Maybe Mike should and should be like LeBron.\n\n(The author is an editor at Very Smart Brothas)"
