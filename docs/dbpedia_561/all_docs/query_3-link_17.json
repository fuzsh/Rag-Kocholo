        "text": "Montenegro is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations.[1] In 2007, over a million tourists visited Montenegro, making some 7.3 million overnight stays (23% increase, compared to 2006). This accounted for some 480 million euros in tourism revenue in 2007 (39% increase, compared to previous year).[citation needed] In 2015, tourism realised over 1.7 million arrivals, with a further increase in 2016.[2] In the same year, the coastal town of Kotor was named the best city to visit by Lonely Planet,[3] whereas the country itself is continuously included in touristic top lists. With a total of 1.8 million visitors in 2016, the nation became the 36th (out of 47 countries) most popular country to travel to in Europe.[4][5] Montenegro was further visited by over 2 million tourists in 2017. The Government aims to attract greenfield investments, which should make best use of undeveloped parts of the coast, such as Jaz Beach, Velika Plaža, Ada Bojana and Buljarica.\n\nMontenegro can be presented as a destination offering a variety of attractions and all-year tourism is possible by publicizing its varied features. Therefore, the Tourism Masterplan of Montenegro is also paving the way for a national development program for nature based tourism, especially hiking and biking, with new infrastructure and services. The realisation of a 3-year-program was started in 2007.\n\nMain points of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nCoastal region\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Coast region\n\nThis notable coastal region is of primary interest to tourists in Montenegro.
