Of the 657 publications identified from the searches, n = 146 articles were included in the final scoping review.\n\nResults\n\nOur findings showcase that salivary samples exceed nasopharyngeal swabs in detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 using reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction testing in several studies. A select number of rapid antigen and point‐of‐care tests from the literature were also identified capable of high detection rates using saliva. Moreover, anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies have been shown to be detectable in saliva through biochemical assays.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe highlight the potential of saliva as an all‐rounded specimen in detecting SARS‐CoV‐2. However, future large‐scale clinical studies will be needed to support its widespread use as a non‐invasive clinical specimen for COVID‐19 testing.\n\nKeywords: COVID‐19, COVID‐19 nucleic acid testing, COVID‐19 serological testing, COVID‐19 testing, early diagnosis, point‐of‐care testing\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nCOVID‐19 has emerged as an unprecedented challenge for the healthcare industry as well the whole world. While recently approved vaccines have begun distribution in many countries, diagnostic tests for COVID‐19 remain an essential tool to detect and track the transmission of the disease until most of the population become vaccinated. Conventional tests use reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) techniques to detect the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acids in patient samples, usually from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens (Udugama et al., 2020). However, NPS collection can be invasive and uncomfortable for patients, and places healthcare workers at risk of infection. NPS sensitivity may also vary depending on time of specimen collection relative to the disease progression of COVID‐19 (Kucirka et al., 2020). All these reasons considered, it is crucial to investigate other promising methods of detection that are less invasive and more accurate for diagnosing COVID‐19.\n\nSaliva and oral fluids have been increasingly used for the detection of various systemic diseases and infections (Javaid et al., 2016). With respect to COVID‐19, there is currently evidence showing multiple pathways through which SARS‐CoV‐2 can show presence in saliva: through spread from the upper/lower respiratory tract, from gingival crevicular fluid, or from direct infection of the salivary glands which can then act as a viral reservoir (Han & Ivanovski, 2020). Moreover, saliva collection is economical, is less invasive and more comfortable for patients, and utilizes minimal equipment (Khurshid et al., 2020). Early studies evaluating SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR using saliva samples reported detection rates of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) as high as 90% (To et al., 2020) as well as high sensitivity and specificity values at 0.88 and 0.92, respectively (Atieh et al., 2021). Further studies have demonstrated that saliva specimens show positive test results even when other respiratory specimens of the same patient test negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 (Hamid et al., 2020). Saliva may also provide information regarding the course of the disease. Viral load has been found to be highest in saliva specimens during the first week of symptom manifestation and serum antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 have been detected in patients while viral RNA was still detectable in saliva (Hamid et al., 2020). Although the extent of COVID‐19 antibodies in saliva is still largely unknown, salivary immunoglobin G (IgG) profiles in general have been shown to be highly similar to plasma IgG profiles for a large number of antigens (Ceron et al., 2020). Therefore, saliva may have the potential to play a major role in COVID‐19 diagnosis and disease progression monitoring, from detecting viral loads not evident in respiratory specimens to screening for immunity. However, large‐scale evaluation of saliva‐based COVID‐19 diagnostic tests compared to the current standard NPS‐based tests have yet to be conducted. Furthermore, the role of saliva as a sample for use in rapid antigen and point‐of‐care (POC) tests may also require further investigation.\n\nThe aim of this review was to provide insight on the current available evidence regarding the efficacy of saliva as a specimen in RT‐PCR‐based COVID‐19 diagnostic tests compared to NPS specimens, as a specimen for rapid antigen/POC COVID‐19 diagnostic tests, and its potential for COVID‐19 immunity screening.\n\n2. METHODS\n\n2.1. Study design\n\nA scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses) Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist (Tricco et al., 2018).\n\n2.2. Search strategy\n\nA systematic search was performed on the following databases: Ovid Medline and Embase, World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Ovid Global Health. The following key terms were used: (exp Coronavirus/OR coronavirus.mp. OR 2019‐nCoV.mp. OR Covid‐19.mp. OR Sars‐CoV‐2.mp. OR novel coronavirus.mp.) AND (exp Diagnosis/OR screen*.tw. OR detect*.tw.) AND (exp Saliva/OR salivary fluid.tw. OR salivary biomarkers.tw. OR saliva.tw. OR saliva sample.tw. OR oral fluid.tw.)\n\n2.3. Eligibility criteria and selection of manuscripts\n\nThe following inclusion criteria were used for screening search results: Articles must be primary research studies, within the publication range 01/01/2019–09/27/2021, in the English language, and contain a study sample of at least 10 confirmed COVID‐19‐positive patients. Included articles were grouped into the following three categories: (1) Saliva as a RT‐PCR Specimen for SARS‐CoV‐2; (2) Rapid antigen/POC COVID‐19 Testing with Saliva; and (3) SARS‐CoV‐2 Antibody Testing with Saliva. Review articles, case studies, animal studies, and letters to the editor were excluded from the study.\n\n2.4. Screening and data extraction\n\nScreening of search results was performed independently by three authors (Y.W., A.U., and P.K.) on Rayyan QCRI. Each author was blinded from the screening results of the other two authors, and all three authors convened after completing independent screening to resolve disagreements through discussion to reach the final decision on included articles. Duplicate articles were excluded. One investigator was assigned to each of the three categories (A.U., Y.W., and P.K.) to extract data from the articles. The final sets of included articles were summarized in Figure and Tables , , along with their relevant details.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nReferencesNumber of patientsSample & saliva collection methodTargetResultsAzzi et al.

Saliva as a RT‐PCR specimen for SARS‐CoV‐2\n\nA plethora of literature has followed utilizing saliva as a diagnostic tool, owing to the evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 presence in saliva (Table ). Studies that made the cutoff criteria for number of patients had sample sizes ranging from 13 to 3000. The cohorts included symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients, patients tested in outpatient departments, general surveys, hospitalized patients, and healthcare workers. Genes amplified for RT‐PCR detection were most commonly the E (Envelope) (n = 38), N (Nucleocapsid) (n = 34), ORF1ab (Open Reading Frame) (n = 31), RdRp (RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase) (n = 24), N1 and N2 (n = 18), S (Spike) (10), and ORF8 (n = 1). Samples collected varied from saliva, naso‐oropharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal swabs, deep throat swabs, gargles, rinses, and cerumen. Different sampling techniques for saliva included drool, spit, gingival fluid, and sputum, and were either self‐collected or collected under healthcare worker supervision/assistance. A few cases included a sample‐specific collection time, such as morning only samples. The disease states extended from general population and healthcare worker surveys in asymptomatic individuals, to symptomatic and hospitalized patients at the convalescent phase of the disease.\n\nSensitivity recorded for saliva samples included values from 44% (Sutjipto et al., 2020), 64% (Kim et al., 2020), and 95.5% (Fukumoto et al., 2020). Specificity for SARS‐CoV‐2 in saliva ranged from 98.5% (95% CI 96.8–99.5) to 99% (Smith‐Jeffcoat et al., 2021). When compared to standard NPS samples, saliva showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90% (95% CI 79%–97%) and a negative predictive value (NPV) 97% (95% CI 96%–98%) (Smith‐Jeffcoat et al., 2021). Cycle threshold (Ct) values range in saliva around 24–40 (Azzi et al., 2020a, 2020b; Barra et al., 2021), with 28.5–35 for the ORF1ab gene and 28.4–33.7 for the N gene as observed by Pasomub and colleagues (Pasomsub et al., 2021). Early morning samples had the highest viral load in hospitalized patients (Hung et al., 2020). Better detection in later stages was also suggested, as dual testing in both positive and recovering patients may limit the spread from such patients by ensuring an appropriate isolation period (Iwasaki et al., 2020; Sahajpal et al., 2021). There is a positive correlation between saliva and NPS samples (Aydin et al., 2021; Matic et al., 2021) with positive percent agreement (PPA) ranging from 66.7% (Ku et al., 2021; Senok et al., 2020) to 100% (Cassinari et al., 2021; Mendoza et al., 2021). More concordance was seen for negative results with negative percent agreement (NPA) values at 91.7% (Ku et al., 2021), 98% (Paliksa et al., 2021; Senok et al., 2020), and 100% (Potter et al., 2021).\n\nAs is the case of Ct values/viral load, current evidence regarding the detection rates between saliva and NPS samples is debatable. Moreno‐Contreras and colleagues concluded saliva samples to be more reliable than NPS samples, with detection rates of 86.2% versus 65%, respectively (Moreno‐Contreras et al., 2020). Similarly, Iwasaki and colleagues observed a detection rate of 95.5% in saliva samples, 87.5% for sputum, and 53% for NPS (Iwasaki et al., 2020). Similar conclusions were made by several authors with variable sample sizes (Ota et al., 2021; Rao et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2021; Teo et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2020; Wyllie et al., 2020; Yokota et al., 2021). No significant difference between the sensitivity or Ct values of saliva and NPS samples was observed on various instances as well (Sun et al., 2021). On the contrary, NPS was found to be 17% more sensitive than saliva by Jamal and colleagues (Jamal et al., 2020) while neither a single NPS nor single saliva sample was 100% sensitive for COVID‐19 detection in another study (Kim et al., 2020). The median Ct values observed by Barra and colleagues were 21.01 (14.53–27.59) for NPS and 29.51 (24.50–40) for saliva, suggesting a lower diagnostic capability of SARS‐CoV‐2 in saliva (Barra et al., 2021). Higher viral load in the NPS samples was evident in multiple cohorts (Tapia et al., 2021; Van Vinh Chau et al., 2020). Furthermore, alternatives such as mouth rinses and gargles were also observed to give a better diagnosis of the infection over saliva samples (Goldfarb et al., 2021).\n\n3.2. POC COVID‐19 testing with saliva\n\nA select number of studies have investigated the potential of saliva to be used as a sample for POC COVID‐19 testing (Table ). With RT‐PCR being the current standard test for detection of SARS‐CoV‐2, one area of interest for the implementation of POC testing using saliva has been automated RT‐PCR‐based assays. One such assay, the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 (Cepheid), is a molecular test that offers a sample‐to‐answer time of approximately 45 min and was granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. The assay targets the N2 gene and E gene of SARS‐CoV‐2, yielding a positive result if both targets or if the N2 gene alone are detected and a presumptive positive result if the E gene alone is detected. With nasopharyngeal specimens currently being the only validated specimens for the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 assay, 3/146 of the included studies in this scoping review attempted to validate the use of the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 assay using saliva as a biological specimen. A diagnostic accuracy study involving 58 COVID‐19‐positive patients compared the sensitivities of NPS specimens and posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens using the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 assay (Chen et al., 2020). The study found no significant difference between NPS (94.8%) and saliva (89.7%) detection rates, but a significantly earlier median Ct value was observed for NPS (26.8) compared to saliva (29.7). In another study, a sample of 120 deep throat saliva specimens tested with the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 assay showed high PPA (98.86%) and NPA (100%) with the standard‐of‐care nucleic acid amplification test (Wong et al., 2020). A study by Vaz and colleagues found similar high concordance between the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 assay results and RT‐PCR results (100%), in addition to the Xpert Xpress SARS‐CoV‐2 assay yielding lower median Ct values for its gene targets (29.7 for E gene and 31.6 for N2 gene) compared to the RT‐PCR median Ct values (34.9 for E gene and 38.3 for RdRp gene) (Vaz et al., 2021).\n\nAn alternative testing method that has the potential to offer rapid, highly sensitive and specific SARS‐CoV‐2 detection is the colorimetric reverse transcriptional loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (RT‐LAMP) assay. In this scoping review, 9/146 of the included studies attempted to validate the performance of RT‐LAMP‐based tests to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in clinical saliva samples. 8 of these studies reported high‐sensitivity values of their respective RT‐LAMP tests ranging from 74.8% to 100% and specificity values ranging from 70.9% to 100% (Chow et al., 2020; Ganguli et al., 2021; Kobayashi et al., 2021; Nagura‐Ikeda et al., 2020; Ptasinska et al., 2021; Xun et al., 2021; Yamazaki et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021). Another study compared the results of RT‐LAMP with RT‐PCR using 30 positive and 30 negative clinical saliva samples and found a 100% PPA and a 96.7% NPA between the two different tests (Toppings et al., 2021).\n\nIn addition to the studies on RT‐PCR and RT‐LAMP‐based tests, two studies reported on novel SARS‐CoV‐2 POC detection assays based on CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas technology. de Puig et al. (2021) developed and evaluated a novel POC diagnostic test, miSHERLOCK (minimally instrumented specific high‐sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking), that utilized CRISPR/Cas technology to target a highly conserved region of the SARS‐CoV‐2 N gene. With a 1‐h sample‐to‐readout time, the miSHERLOCK diagnostic reported a 95% sensitivity and 96% specificity using a sample size of 27 positive and 21 negative unprocessed saliva samples. A study by Azmi and colleagues combined CRISPR‐Cas13a‐based RNA detection and lateral flow assay readouts, CASSPIT (Cas13 Assisted Saliva‐based and Smartphone Integrated Testing) for unprocessed saliva‐based detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Azmi et al., 2021). Using 40 saliva samples from COVID‐19‐positive patients, the authors reported a 98% PPA with RT‐PCR data for samples with Ct values under 35.\n\n3.3. Rapid antigen COVID‐19 testing with saliva\n\nThe use of COVID‐19 rapid antigen tests has especially amassed an increasing demand throughout the course of the pandemic, and as a result, several studies have investigated the use of saliva as a testing specimen for commercial SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen detection assays. 12/146 of the included studies in this scoping review evaluated the performance of saliva samples in commercial SARS‐CoV‐2 rapid antigen tests. Immunochromatographic assays, such as the Espline SARS‐CoV‐2 rapid antigen test (Fujirebio), were one of the more commonly tested SARS‐CoV‐2 POC tests in these studies using saliva as a biological specimen. 3/5 studies that tested the Espline SARS‐CoV‐2 assay reported low sensitivity values ranging from 11.7% to 33.0% (Ishii et al., 2021; Nagura‐Ikeda et al., 2020; Yokota et al., 2021). However, another study reported a concordance rate of 95.1% with viral culture results. (Uwamino et al., 2021). A different study found similar results, reporting that satisfactory sensitivity values for the Espline SARS‐CoV‐2 assay were achieved only for high viral load samples with Ct values below 25 for NPS RT‐qPCR results (Basso et al., 2021). Another three studies evaluated the clinical performance of three other immunochromatography‐based POC COVID‐19 tests, the COVID‐VIRO assay (AAZ), the Panbio assay (Abbott), and the Lepu SARS‐CoV‐2 test kit (Lepu Medical Technology). A study by Courtellemont and colleagues that evaluated the diagnostic performance of the COVID‐VIRO assay for NPS samples collected a subset of 14 COVID‐19‐positive saliva samples that reported a dismal 0% sensitivity using the assay (Courtellemont et al., 2021). Meanwhile, a study by Stokes and colleagues reported a 2.6% sensitivity of the Panbio assay before saliva sample collection was terminated due to poor detection rates compared to NPS (Stokes et al., 2021). Finally, a study by Saeed and colleagues reported an overall sensitivity of 21% when using the Lepu SARS‐CoV‐2 test kit on a saliva sample size of 100 COVID‐19‐positive patients, including men, women, and children (Saeed et al., 2021).\n\nChemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays, such as the Lumipulse SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen kit (Fujirebio), are another subset of rapid antigen tests for COVID‐19 that have been tested using saliva samples in several studies. Of the 6 studies included in this scoping review that assessed the diagnostic performance of the Lumipulse SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen kit, 4 studies reported high‐sensitivity values ranging from 72.0% to 99.2% while one study reported a low sensitivity value of 52.4% (Amendola et al., 2021; Basso et al., 2021; Ishii et al., 2021; Yokota et al., 2021, 2021). With respect to specificity values, the studies that measured specificity using COVID‐19‐negative saliva samples reported values of 94.1%, 96.9%, and 98.6% (Amendola et al., 2021; Basso et al., 2021; Ishii et al., 2021). Furthermore, one study compared the diagnostic performance of the Lumipulse SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen kit to RT‐qPCR with a saliva sample size of 2056 and found a 98.2% concordance rate between the two diagnostic tests (Yokota et al., 2021). The Elecsys SARS‐CoV‐2 Antigen assay (Roche), a electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, was also evaluated using saliva specimens in a study that found 100% PPA with RT‐PCR of NPS samples having Ct values of less than 26 only, while the overall PPA was reported to be 40.2% (Audigé et al., 2021).\n\n3.4. SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody testing with saliva\n\nSome studies included in this scoping review have explored techniques using saliva for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody screening (Table ). Our findings confirmed that, combined with direct SARS‐CoV‐2 detection methods used for identifying currently infected COVID‐19 patients, anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody detection using saliva could provide a rapid and non‐invasive alternative method for differentiating between non‐infected, previously infected, and presently infected patients. To readily identify antibody responses in serum and saliva of SARS‐CoV‐2 patients, standard ELISA (enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay) methods have been modified to be more sensitive to the high‐quality S protein and used as a tool for short‐term and long‐term humoral immunity (Faustini et al., 2021). MacMullan and colleagues concluded that following their optimized protocol in saliva samples, antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 were detectable with a sensitivity of at least 84.2% and a specificity of 100% in symptomatic patients (MacMullan et al., 2020). In another study, MacMullan and a group of colleagues found that the OraSure test (OraSure), an oral antibody detection technology and its paired ELISA, have comparable sensitivity and specificity with the serum‐based ELISAs and offers potential for self‐collection (MacMullan et al., 2021).\n\nCaulley and colleagues evaluated patients that tested positive on saliva/swab PCR tests and compared their presence of serum SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibodies. They found that the PCR‐based tests have limitations as participants demonstrated seropositivity 5 months post‐infection (Caulley et al., 2021). Thus, some studies argue that a combination of RNA detection with antibody testing may be required for optimal detection (Ter‐Ovanesyan et al., 2021). In one study, Ter‐Ovanesyan and colleagues entertained the idea of using the same saliva sample to develop an efficient saliva RNA extraction and an antibody test. In doing so, they used single‐molecule array (SIMOA) technology and concluded that the RNA and antibody‐paired detection identifies the virus at a higher sensitivity than each method alone (Ter‐Ovanesyan et al., 2021).\n\nIn this regard, Faustini and colleagues attest that without such a sensitive method, detection of responses in asymptomatic patients may be suboptimal and less reliable than the PCR tests (Faustini et al., 2021). They suggest that a native‐like, trimeric S antigen is preferred to the N antigen for detection of antibodies and that, if the detection of one Ig is run in parallel with others, their combined detection enhances antibody recognition (Faustini et al., 2021). The persistence of serum and saliva antibody responses to SARS‐CoV‐2 spike antigens in patients was confirmed by Isho and colleagues as they indicated that those antibodies, especially IgG, may be maintained in patients for months post‐symptom onset (Isho et al., 2020). Based on their findings, they suggested that IgG responses in saliva are a good representative measure for systemic immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 due to the correlation with the serum IgG responses. As a complementary population‐based approach, surveys on mucosal immunity revealed that salivary IgG against SARS‐CoV‐2 persists even at 9 months after mild COVID‐19 infections (Alkharaan et al., 2021). Moreover, salivary IgA appeared to be short‐lived, while specific salivary IgG was stable after mild COVID‐19 and therefore presents an opportunity for non‐invasive, self‐collective saliva testing (Alkharaan et al., 2021). Liu and colleagues quantified the antibody avidities and its accurate detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies in serum and saliva using a high‐performance semi‐quantitative assay (Liu et al., 2020). They specifically detected IgG, IgM, and IgA avidity against the S1 subunit of the spike protein and the RBD (receptor‐binding domain) of the virus. Another study verified standardized saliva collection as a suitable approach for detecting and monitoring SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by measuring anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgA to replace NPS testing (Aita et al., 2020).\n\nFurthermore, SARS‐CoV‐2 protease molecules have recently proven significant to COVID‐19 research. A study done by Martinez‐Fleta and colleagues explored salivary cysteine‐like protease antibodies as a detectable agent in COVID‐19‐seropositive patients (Martinez‐Fleta et al., 2020). One of these agents is Mpro (main protease), which undertakes a critical role in viral replication, releases mature proteins for the virus, and can be detected using ELISA. The authors concluded that COVID‐19 patients show higher titers IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses to the cysteine‐like protease molecule from SARS‐CoV‐2, Mpro, and that such response can be quantified noninvasively and rapidly from saliva as a seropositivity test (Martinez‐Fleta et al., 2020).\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nRT‐qPCR is widely known today as a laboratory technique during which an RNA sequence is reverse transcribed to make complimentary DNA, which is further amplified by polymerase chain reaction. For SARS‐CoV‐2, as described earlier, RT‐PCR is considered the standard for diagnosis as several specific mRNAs can be targeted for its detection, such as the mRNAs of ORF1b and the N and E structural proteins (Figure ). Thus, various recommendations have been made for diagnostic testing of COVID‐19 by different organizations (Corman et al., 2020; Okamaoto et al., 2020). From the selected articles, there is a clear ambiguity in the method of sample collection and the target for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection using saliva. Some researchers used drooling saliva to collect the samples as it eliminated the mucous secretions from the oropharynx and lower respiratory tract (Azzi et al., 2020a, 2020b). Others collected patient saliva by clearing of throat as soon as possible after waking up, before breakfast and brushing to include both bronchopulmonary secretions and nasopharyngeal secretions (Leung et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020). Furthermore, the time point of sample collection, the severity, and stage of disease have also been variable across the studies (Hung et al., 2020). There is uncertainty in the evidence for assessing the potential of saliva as a diagnostic tool, attributing to the variabilities in methodologies. In conclusion, it can be said that saliva is a reliable tool for COVID‐19 detection but both NPS and saliva specimens should be taken for screening and diagnosis, while gargle and mouth rinse can be another alternative.\n\nPOC testing has been defined in the literature as diagnostic tests that are conducted “outside the laboratory at or near the site of patient care, including the patient's bedside, the doctor's office, and the patient's home” (Khurshid, 2018). As the current method of testing that is most well‐documented and accepted by medical staff and the scientific community, RT‐PCR testing continues to be the most well‐established methodology for COVID‐19 diagnostics and offers the highest reliability among POC testing options. However, the high equipment cost, training required for interpretation of results, and longer turnaround time continue to limit its use mostly to mass‐testing facilities with access to trained laboratory personnel and equipment (Carter et al., 2020). Current RT‐PCR‐based POC COVID‐19 tests require specialized equipment for analyzing results that may only be attainable in healthcare and laboratory settings. In comparison, RT‐LAMP‐based tests offer results that may be easily interpreted by non‐laboratory trained staff and faster turnaround time relative to RT‐PCR‐based tests but lack the research background and large‐scale clinical validation needed to scale‐up its usage (Dao Thi et al., 2020). The low cost and high reliability of currently available RT‐LAMP POC test kits may potentially allow employment of this testing method in hospital, clinical, and pre‐travel settings. However, challenges behind building, distributing, and administering RT‐LAMP‐based tests may not favor their use in common workplace or social settings compared to rapid antigen tests.\n\nRapid antigen tests are another method through which one targets a specific macromolecule of the virus, such as the highly conserved spike protein (Jacobs et al., 2020). The sampling method is similar to PCR‐based methods in that detection depends on the viral load but is advantageous in that it requires no specific equipment nor highly trained personnel. In this method, just like any other chromatographic method, a mobile phase (buffer mixed with the biological specimen) migrates through a stationary phase (e.g., nitrocellulose) tagged with antibodies against the viral antigens. If the viral antigens are present, they attach the antibodies and their accumulation can be detected by a visible chemical reaction which appears on the nitrocellulose membrane. The current CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines state that rapid antigen tests are commonly employed in congregate settings such as dormitories, nursing homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters to screen for COVID‐19 infections. Due to the low turnaround time ranging from 15 to 30 min and low cost per test, rapid antigen tests offer the main benefit of rapidly identifying infected individuals in the community and workplace setting to prevent transmission and assist infection control measures. However, the overall lower sensitivity of rapid antigen tests suggests that asymptomatic individuals who test negative may require confirmatory laboratory testing using nucleic acid amplification tests (Corman et al., 2021).\n\nFrom this scoping review, it is evident that the current literature supports the use of saliva as an alternative specimen when compared to NPS for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection. Utilizing an optimized, saliva‐based, rapid or POC kit may help overcome many current pandemic challenges while dealing with the newly emerging SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nNone to declare.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nYifei Wang: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Validation; Visualization; Writing – original draft; Writing – review & editing.
