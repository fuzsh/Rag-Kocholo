        "text": "Report on the Situation of Albanian language Education in Kosova\n\nThe letter was signed August 12 1997 by Abdyl Ramaj, Secretary of the Commission for Education of Democratic League of Kosova, and Head of Parliamentary Commission for Education, Science, Culture and Sports of Kosova. It was sent to Frederico Mayor UNESCO General Director, as well as to several embassies in Belgrade.\n\nTHE SITUATION IN ALBANIAN EDUCATION IN KOSOVA AND POSSIBILITIES FOR ITS TEMPORARY NORMALIZATION\n\nUnder the Constitution of Kosova and pursuant to appropriate laws provisions, Kosova had full independence in regulating the education, science and culture, just like the other republics of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nFollowing the forceful annexation of Kosova and the suspension of its legitimate institutions, the Serbian regime suspended all the Kosova institutions related to education. It should be noted that the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Kosova (Secretariat of Education, Science and Culture of Kosova) as the highest organ, as well as other educational institutions, administered and maintained independently the entire educational, cultural and scientific life in Kosova. As a result, the educational authorities of Kosova were fully independent to compile and approve the curricula, to decide about the network of schools, and to control the whole educational system of Kosova. Before the Serb crack-down on Kosova, Albanian-language and Serb-language education functioned as parallel mediums of education in Kosova.\n\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN KOSOVA\n\nThe destruction of educational system of Kosova has been lasting process, yet it intensified after 1981 with systematic persecution of students and teachers, the so-called political [communist] differentiation or complete dismissal of teachers, annulment of Kosova legislation on education, science and culture and introduction of Serb laws instead, segregation through dividing Albanian and Serb schoolchildren into different school buildings, etc. However, the process of destruction of Kosova education escalated in 1990. In spring of that year, deliberate intoxication of around 7.400 Albanian schoolchildren occurred in schools, while only a few months later, in autumn, the regime began with the closure of secondary schools. By the end of 1990, the Serbian Parliament decided that one half of secondary schools in Kosova be closed down, while in April of 1991 the Serb Parliament decided that only 28 per cent of pupils who were expected to complete their primary education that year in Kosova could resume with their secondary education. The 1991/91 school year is the year when through the use of force Serbia locked down school buildings of primary and secondary education and the University of Prishtina. As a result 396 full-class [from 1st to 8th grade] primary schools, 454 four-year and annex primary schools, 56 secondary schools, 7 teachers training and engineering colleges, and 13 faculties were closed down that year. Around 14.500 primary and 4.000 secondary school and 862 University teachers were dismissed. Owing to international pressure Serbia was forced to re-open most of the primary schools in the meantime. Yet, schoolchildren of 41 elementary schools have not been allowed to attend classes in their school ever since. The pupils of 11 such schools have been sent to attend classes in other primary schools of the community, while those of 26 others attend classes in make-shift classrooms in private houses. There are today 441 full elementary primary schools (pupils of 41 are not allowed access to school buildings) with a total of 266.413 pupils and 13.585 teachers and other education-related personnel in Kosova.\n\nOut of 66 secondary schools operating today in Kosova, students of 6 of them only are allowed access to their school buildings. All the rest attend classes in inadequate makeshift classrooms in private houses and other buildings of community. Albanian secondary school students are also denied access to their facilities: school libraries, dormitories, sport halls (gyms) etc.\n\nAs many as 58.700 students attend secondary school education, with a teaching staff of 4.310.\n\nMore or less the situation is the same at the University of Prishtina. It has been six years now since Albanian students were expelled from 7 high schools (colleges) and 13 faculties. Besides the lecturing halls, Albanian students are denied access to the University Library, the libraries in faculties and departments, dormitories, dinning halls and canteens, sports halls (gyms) etc. In the 1996/97 academic year, there were around 16.000 students (both full-time and part-time) studying at the Albanian-medium University of Prishtina in make-shift classrooms and halls. The University teaching personnel is made of 826 full-time teachers and 200 part-time and associate teachers.\n\nFollowing is the list primary schools in which Albanian schoolchildren are denied access to but are forced to either attend classes in make-shift classrooms or have bee sent to other schools where access for the Albanian has been allowed:\n\n(Note: The word classroom stands for improvised, make-shift classrooms, outside school buildings)\n\nFUSHË KOSOVË\n\n1.

Attacks at the Kosovar higher education began with the imposition of the so-called emergency measures (coercive administration) at the Clinic of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the Medical Faculty. All the Albanian-language personnel and other staff were suspended. The Department of Surgery was to face the same measures very soon.\n\n2.Emergency measures were introduced at the Medical Faculty (Official gazette 20/90; 26.09 1990). 90 per cent of the Albanian personnel (from academicians to nurses) were dismissed. The Medical Faculty was in this way virtually closed down.\n\n3.The Serbian regime extended a new law on students enrolment for the 1991/92 academic year (Official Gazette No.28/91; 31.05.1991).\n\nAccording to new legislation, the enrolment ratio was to be 1:1 for Serbs and Albanians (1500 Albanian and 1500 Serb freshmen). Albanians who had completed the secondary education that year outnumbered the Serbs with 9 to 1.\n\n4.On 27 June 1991, emergency measures were introduced in all the faculties of the Prishtina University. All the Albanian administering personnel, deans, vice-deans, and others were ousted and Serbs were installed instead. A University teaching staff of 862 was dismissed soon, while 122 teachers and other personnel were dismissed on alleged redundancy reasons.\n\n5.On 16 October 1991, the University of Prishtina was closed for Albanian students. Serb police were deployed in front of the faculties and other accessory buildings of the University. The University of Prishtina, with 7 high schools (teachers and technical training colleges) and 13 faculties has been ever since operating in make-shift classrooms and lecturing halls in private houses and other facilities of the community. (During the last 1996/97 academic year the Albanian-medium University had around 16.000 students, full-time and part-time).\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS OF THE PRISHTINA UNIVERSITY:\n\n(Note: A High School is a two-year university-level college.

The only Childrens Books Publisher is Closed Down.\n\nPursuant to the decision no.203 of 11 July 1991 of the Serbian Parliament, emergency measures were imposed at the only childrens book publisher in the former Yugoslavia. The whole personnel of the Bureau for Textbook Publishers of Kosova was dismissed. For five years now this textbook publishers company has been closed pursuant to Serb laws.\n\nIn the beginning the primary spelling book (Abecedarium) was printed in Italy. It had to be smuggled in the country in exceptionally dangerous circumstances. A limited number of textbooks in Albanian for schoolchildren is being printed now in extremely grave conditions.\n\n1.Pursuant to decisions No.400 - 20/91 and 400/15/91 of 20 February 1991 of the Serb Parliament, since January 1991, all the Albanians teaching with the 1st and 5th grade of primary schools and 1st year of secondary schools had their wages cut.\n\n2.Pursuant to Decision No.400-41/91 of 7 March 1991, the whole secondary school teaching personnel in Albanian (around 5000 people) had their payment cut. .\n\n3. Pursuant to Decision No.400-137/91 of 30 May 1991, the rest of the primary school teaching personnel (around 14.500 persons) had their wages/salaries cut.\n\n4.Pursuant to Decision No. 400-211/91 of 18 November 1991, the funds for higher education of Kosova were cut.\n\nWhat could be the measures for temporary normalization of the situation in Kosovar education\n\nFull normalization of the situation in Kosova education could only occur with the settlement of the political status of Kosova. The current situation could be overcome if the issue is treated as pure educational matter, by circumventing or reducing political implications around it.\n\nWithin such a framework, 13 rounds of talks were held under the Geneva Conference with the mediation of\n\nAmbassador Geert Ahrens. Later, under the mediation of the Vatican-based Saint Egidio Community, an agreement was reached which provided for conditions to removed the blockade from school premise and for an unconditional return of Albanian schoolchildren and pupils to their schools. An Accord on this matter was signed by presidents Dr.Ibrahim Rugova and Slobodan Milosevic. Regrettably, the Accord was never implemented to this day.\n\nWe hope you will wield your influence in finding an acceptable settlement so that Albanian pupils, students and teachers are allowed to return to their school facilities they were expelled from through the use of force. A temporary solution should be found to the issues without prejudging the settlement of the political status of Kosova.\n\nNegotiations on such a goal could at last result in the following:\n\nI\n\n1.To bring to an end all repression against Albania school, pupils, students, teachers and other people involved in running Albanian-language education.\n\n2.To allow Albanians access to education-related facilities, the ones they were in possession of earlier:\n\na)to immediately release the buildings of 35 primary schools and their annex classes.\n\nb) To release all the school buildings of secondary education the Albanians were expelled from, i.e. premises of 60 secondary schools and their accessory facilities: dormitories, libraries, sports halls (gyms), etc.\n\nc) To release university premises in 7 high schools (teachers training and engineering colleges) and 13 faculties, as well as their accessory facilities: the University and National Library, the institutes, dormitories, dinning halls and canteens, sports halls, etc.\n\nII\n\nTEMPORARY NORMALIZATION OF FINANCING THE EDUCATION\n\nA normalization of the financing the Kosova education could only be reached with a final settlement of the Kosova issue. However, a temporary solution to the matter could be found through: the taxes collected from the citizens and the contribution Kosovars have been paying, and their share in socially-owned production. An adequate fund could be earmarked for the Kosova Financing Council.\n\nIII\n\nRestoration of normality in the Kosova Textbook Publishers Bureau by releasing its premises and the capital the Bureau used to possess.\n\nIV\n\nTo allow a normal functioning of administering, professional and training institutions of education: the Pedagogical Bureau of Kosova, municipal educational councils, pedagogical and supervision services, etc.\n\nPrishtina, August 12, 1997\n\nAbdyl RAMAJ"
