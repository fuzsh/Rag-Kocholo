Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, Arsène Shalom Ntahobali, Sylvain Nsabimana, Alphone Nteziryayo, Joseph Kanyabashi and Élie Ndayambaje, Case No. ICTR-98-42-A, Judgement (AC), 14 December 2015, para. 508:\n\n\"508. To the extent that the Trial Chamber relied on Nyiramasuhuko’s orders to rape women as circumstantial evidence of her genocidal intent in relation to the crime of genocide committed at the prefectoral office, the Appeals Chamber observes that the Prosecution expressly pleaded under the count of genocide that Nyiramasuhuko acted with “the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a racial or ethnic group” in relation to the crimes committed at the Butare Prefecture Office,1174 thus providing clear notice to Nyiramasuhuko that she was alleged to have acted with genocidal intent. Given that the Indictment pleaded Nyiramasuhuko’s specific state of mind in relation to the count of genocide, the evidentiary facts by which her mens rea was to be established did not need to be pleaded.1175 The Appeals Chamber therefore finds no error in the Trial Chamber’s reliance on Nyiramasuhuko’s orders to commit rape as evidence of her genocidal intent.\n\n1174.

The perpetrator \"intended\" to destroy that group.\n\nA. Legal source/authority and evidence:\n\nThe Prosecutor v. Edouard Karemera and Matthieu Ngirumpatse, Case No. ICTR-98-44, Judgement (TC), 2 February 2012, para. 1635, 1642, 1650:\n\n1635. The Chamber has found that Karemera’s letter of 25 May 1994 regarding the implementation of Jean Kambanda’s directives, which he issued to préfets as Minister of the Interior for the Interim Government, had the effect of encouraging the continued killing of Tutsis. The only reasonable conclusion is that the perpetrators of the killings had the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi group.\n\n1642. Given the open and notorious slaughter of Tutsis with cutting and thrusting weapons, and Karemera’s suggestion that the préfectures arm themselves with these weapons, the Chamber is convinced that Karemera was aware of the genocidal intent of the perpetrators and shared it.\n\n1650. Considering the scale of the assaults and the brutal and systematic manner in which the Tutsi victims were attacked, the Chamber finds it proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the assailants who physically perpetrated the killings possessed the intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, the Tutsi group. In the context of the notorious and open slaughter of Tutsis in Bisesero at which the national and regional authorities were present, the Chamber concludes, as the only reasonable inference, that the authorities who ordered and instigated these attacks, as well as Karemera and Ngirumpatse, shared the assailants’ genocidal intent.\n\nProsecutor v. Tharcisse Muvunyi, Case No. ICTR-00-55A-T, Judgement (TC), 11 February 2009, para 29:\n\n\"29. By its nature, intent is not always susceptible to direct proof. In the absence of direct evidence, a perpetrator’s genocidal intent may be inferred from relevant facts and circumstances that can lead beyond reasonable doubt to the existence of the intent, provided that it is the only reasonable inference that can be made from the totality of the evidence. Genocidal intent may be inferred from certain facts or indicia, including but not limited to:\n\n(a) the general context; (b) the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against that same group, whether these acts were committed by the same offender or by others; (c) the scale of atrocities committed; (d) their general nature; (e) their execution in a region or a country; (f) the fact that the victims were deliberately and systematically chosen on account of their membership in a particular group; (g) the exclusion, in this regard, of members of other groups; (h) the political doctrine which gave rise to the acts referred to; (i) the repetition of destructive and discriminatory acts; and (j) the perpetration of acts which violate the very foundation of the group or are considered as such by their perpetrators.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Vidoje Blagojević and Dragan Jokić, Case No. IT-02-60-T, Judgement (TC), 17 January 2005, para. 656:\n\n\"656. The Appeals Chamber has held that \"the specific intent requires that the perpetrator seeks to achieve the destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such,\"2083 although it found that the existence of a plan or policy is not a legal requirement of the crime.2084 It is not sufficient that the perpetrator simply knew that the underlying crime would inevitably or likely result in the destruction of the group. The destruction, in whole or in part, must be the aim of the underlying crime(s).\"\n\n\"2083. Jelisić Appeal Judgement, para. 46\n\n2084. Jelisić Appeal Judgement, para. 48.\"\n\nProsecutor v.

It is possible to infer the genocidal intent inherent in a particular act charged from the perpetrator’s deeds and utterances considered together, as well as from the general context of the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against that same group, notwithstanding that the said acts were committed by the same offender or by others. Other factors, such as the scale of atrocities committed, their general nature, in a region or a country, or furthermore, the fact of deliberately and systematically targeting victims on account of their membership in a particular group, while excluding members of other groups, can enable the Chamber to infer the genocidal intent of a particular act.237\n\n253. Evidence of genocidal intent can be inferred from \"the physical targeting of the group or their property; the use of derogatory language toward members of the targeted group; the weapons employed and the extent of bodily injury; the methodical way of planning, the systematic manner of killing\".238 The notion of \"destruction of a group\" means \"the material destruction of a group either by physical or by biological means, not the destruction of the national, linguistic, religious, cultural or other identity of a particular group\".239 In proving the intent to destroy \"in whole or in part\", it is not necessary to establish that the perpetrator intended to achieve the complete annihilation of a group from every corner of the globe. There is no numeric threshold of victims necessary to establish genocide,240 even though the relative proportionate scale of the actual or attempted destruction of a group, by any act listed in Article 2 of the Statute, is strong evidence to prove the necessary intent to destroy a group in whole or in part.241\"\n\n\"237.

In order to be held criminally liable for genocide by killing members of a group, in addition to showing that an accused possessed an intent to destroy the group as such, in whole or in part, the Prosecutor must show the following elements: (1) the perpetrator intentionally killed one or more members of the group, without the necessity of premeditation;539 and (2) such victim or victims belonged to the targeted ethnical, racial, national, or religious group.540\"\n\n\"539.

Duško Sikirica et al, Case No. IT-95-8-T, Judgement on Defence Motions to Acquit (TC), 3 September 2001, paras. 46, 57 – 61:\n\n\"46. The Prosecution contends that, although it is extremely unlikely that there be direct evidence of the accused’s intent to commit genocide, such intent can be inferred from the evidence.120 In its oral arguments, the Prosecution referred to the Kayishema and Ruzindana Appeal Judgement oral summary, which held that, regarding a lack of explicit manifestation of intent, the requisite intent may normally be inferred from facts and circumstances.121 The Appeals Chamber held that, generally, such an intent may be inferred from the words or deeds of the perpetrator and may be demonstrated by a deliberate pattern of conduct. The Appeals Chamber however stated that this persistent pattern of conduct was not an element of the crime of genocide but rather a means of proof so as to demonstrate whether the accused actually possessed the requisite intent.122 The Prosecution then referred to the Jelisić Appeal Brief, which set the following factors as being relevant to prove the mens rea element of genocide:\n\n(a) The general and widespread nature of the atrocities committed;\n\n(b) The general political doctrine giving rise to the acts;\n\n(c) The scale of the actual or attempted destruction;\n\n(d) Methodical way of planning the killings;\n\n(e) The systematic manner of killing and disposal of bodies;\n\n(f) The discriminatory nature of the acts;\n\n(g) The discriminatory intent of the accused. 123\n\nThe history relative to these factors is set out below. 124\"\n\n\"120.

Prosecution Response to the Sikirica Motion, para. 8, citing Jelisić Appeal Brief, para. 4.44, with authorities.\n\n124. In identifying these seven factors, the Prosecution has drawn from the Akayesu Trial Judgement, para. 523 and from Prosecutor v. Clément Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, Case No. ICTR-95-1-T, Judgement, 21 May 1999 (\"Kayishema Trial Judgement\"), para. 93, wherein the Trial Chambers set forth several factors from which the requisite intent may be inferred. Jelisić Appeal Brief, paras. 4.42–4.44. The Appeals Chamber in Jelisić held that in the absence of direct evidence, proof of specific intent may be inferred from \"a number of facts and circumstances, such as the general context, the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against the same group, the scale of atrocities committed, the systematic targeting of victims on account of their membership of a particular group, or the repetition of destructive and discriminatory acts.\" Jelisić Appeal Judgement, para. 47.\"\n\n\"57. The Trial Chamber notes the Prosecution submission that evidence that satisfies any of the following three standards meets the requirement of Article 4 that the accused must have committed the act \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such\":\n\n(a) The accused consciously desired the genocidal acts to result in the destruction, in whole or in part, of the group, as such;\n\n(b) The accused, having committed his or her genocidal acts consciously and with will to act, knew that the genocidal acts were actually destroying, in whole or in part, the group, as such; or\n\n(c) The accused, being an aidor and abettor to a manifest, ongoing genocide, knowing that there was such an ongoing genocide and that his or her conduct of aiding and abetting was part of that ongoing genocide, knew that the likely consequence of his or her conduct would be to destroy, in whole or in part, the group, as such.Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstić, Case No. IT-98-33-T, Judgement (TC), 2 August 2001, paras. 549, 571 – 572:\n\n\"549. As a preliminary, the Chamber emphasises the need to distinguish between the individual intent of the accused and the intent involved in the conception and commission of the crime. The gravity and the scale of the crime of genocide ordinarily presume that several protagonists were involved in its perpetration. Although the motive of each participant may differ, the objective of the criminal enterprise remains the same. In such cases of joint participation, the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group as such must be discernible in the criminal act itself, apart from the intent of particular perpetrators. It is then necessary to establish whether the accused being prosecuted for genocide shared the intention that a genocide be carried out.\"\n\n\"571. The preparatory work of the Genocide Convention clearly shows that the drafters envisaged genocide as an enterprise whose goal, or objective, was to destroy a human group, in whole or in part. United Nations General Assembly resolution 96 (I) defined genocide as \"the denial of the right of existence of entire human groups\".1267 The draft Convention prepared by the Secretary-General presented genocide as a criminal act which aims to destroy a group, in whole or in part,1268 and specified that this definition excluded certain acts, which may result in the total or partial destruction of a group, but are committed in the absence of an intent to destroy the group.1269 The International Law Commission upheld this interpretation and indicated that \"a general intent to commit one of the enumerated acts combined with a general awareness of the probable consequences of such an act with respect to the immediate victim or victims is not sufficient for the crime of genocide. The definition of this crime requires a particular state of mind or a specific intent with respect to the overall consequence of the prohibited act\".1270 The International Court of Justice insisted, in its Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,1271 that specific intent to destroy was required and indicated that \"the prohibition of genocide would be pertinent in this case if the recourse to nuclear weapons did indeed entail the element of intent, towards a group as such, required by the provision quoted above\".1272 The ICTR adopted the same interpretation. In The Prosecutor v. Jean Kambanda, the Trial Chamber stated: \"the crime of genocide is unique because of its element of dolus specialis (special intent) which requires that the crime be committed with the intent ‘to destroy in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group as such’\".1273 In Kayishema, Ruzindana, the Trial Chamber also emphasised that \"genocide requires the aforementioned specific intent to exterminate a protected group (in whole or in part)\".1274 Moreover, the Chamber notes that the domestic law of some States distinguishes genocide by the existence of a plan to destroy a group.1275 Some legal commentators further contend that genocide embraces those acts whose foreseeable or probable consequence is the total or partial destruction of the group without any necessity of showing that destruction was the goal of the act.1276 Whether this interpretation can be viewed as reflecting the status of customary international law at the time of the acts involved here is not clear. For the purpose of this case, the Chamber will therefore adhere to the characterisation of genocide which encompass only acts committed with the goal of destroying all or part of a group.\n\n\"1267.

E/447 (1947), p. 20 \"the word genocide means a criminal act directed against any one of the aforesaid groups of human beings, with the purpose of destroying it in whole or in part, or of preventing its preservation or development\".\n\n1269.

ILC Draft Code, p. 88 (emphasis added).\n\n1271. ICJ Repors (1996), p. 240.\n\n1272. Para. 26. The Chamber notes however that several dissenting opinions criticised the Opinion on the issue by holding that an act whose foreseeable result was the destruction of a group as such and which did indeed cause the destruction of the group did constitute genocide. In particular, Judge Weeramantry observes that the use of nuclear weapons inevitably brings about the destruction of entire populations and constitutes, as such, genocide. He thus challenges the interpretation that \"there must be an intention to target a particular national, ethnical, racial or religious group qua such group, and not incidentally to some other act\" (Reports p. 502). In the same vein, Judge Koroma comments on \"the abhorrent shocking consequences that a whole population could be wiped out by the use of nuclear weapons during an armed conflict\". He claims that such a situation constitutes genocide \"if the consequences of the act could have been foreseen\" (Reports, p. 577).\n\n1273. ICTR 97-23-S, 4 September 1998 (hereinafter The \"Kambanda Judgement\"), para. 16.\n\n1274. 21 May 1999, para. 89.\"\n\n1275. Article 211-1 of the French Criminal Code states that the crime must be committed \"in the execution of a concerted plan to destroy wholly or partially a group\".\n\n\"1276. See in particular Eric David, Droit des conflits armés, p. 615; Alexander K.A. Greenawalt, \"Rethinking genocidal intent: the case for a knowledge-based interpretation\", Columbia Law Review, December 1999, pp. 2259-2294; Gil Gil Derecho penal internacional, especial consideracion del delito de genicidio, 1999.\n\n572. Article 4 of the Statute does not require that the genocidal acts be premeditated over a long period.1277 It is conceivable that, although the intention at the outset of an operation was not the destruction of a group, it may become the goal at some later point during the implementation of the operation. For instance, an armed force could decide to destroy a protected group during a military operation whose primary objective was totally unrelated to the fate of the group.\"\n\n1277. The element of premeditation was dismissed at the proposal of Belgium (UN Doc. A/C.6/217) on the ground that such a provision was superfluous in light of the special intent already incorporated into the definition of the crime (UN Doc. A/C.6/SR.72, p. 8).\"\n\nProsecutor v. Ignace Bagilishema, Case No. ICTR-95-1A-T, Judgment (TC), 7 June 2001, paras. 55, 60:\n\n\"55. [A] crime of genocide is proven if it is established beyond reasonable doubt […] that this act was committed against a specifically targeted national, ethnical, racial or religious group, with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, that group.\"\n\n\"60. The dolus specialis of the crime of genocide is found in the \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.\"\"\n\nProsecutor v. Goran Jelisić, Case No. IT-95-10-T, Judgement (TC), 14 December 1999, paras. 46, 78, 100:\n\n\"46. The specific intent requires that the perpetrator, by one of the prohibited acts enumerated in Article 4 of the Statute, seeks to achieve the destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.82\"\n\n\"82. The Appeals Chamber notes it is speaking here solely in the context of the commission of genocide within the meaning of Article 4 of the Statute.\"\n\n\"78. In examining the intentionality of an attack against a group, the Trial Chamber will first consider the different concepts of the notion of destruction of a group as such before then reviewing the degree of intent required for a crime to be constituted. In other words, the Trial Chamber will have to verify that there was both an intentional attack against a group and an intention upon the part of the accused to participate in or carry out this attack. Indeed, the intention necessary for the commission of a crime of genocide may not be presumed even in the case where the existence of a group is at least in part threatened. The Trial Chamber must verify whether the accused had the \"special\" intention which, beyond the discrimination of the crimes he commits, characterises his intent to destroy the discriminated group as such, at least in part.\"\n\n\"100. Such a case is theoretically possible. The murders committed by the accused are sufficient to establish the material element of the crime of genocide and it is a priori possible to conceive that the accused harboured the plan to exterminate an entire group without this intent having been supported by any organisation in which other individuals participated147. In this respect, the preparatory work of the Convention of 1948 brings out that premeditation was not selected as a legal ingredient of the crime of genocide, after having been mentioned by the ad hoc committee at the draft stage, on the grounds that it seemed superfluous given the special intention already required by the text148 and that such precision would only make the burden of proof even greater149. It ensues from this omission that the drafters of the Convention did not deem the existence of an organisation or a system serving a genocidal objective as a legal ingredient of the crime. In so doing, they did not discount the possibility of a lone individual seeking to destroy a group as such.\"\n\n\"147. Pieter N. Drost, The Crime of State, Genocide, A.W. Sythoff, Leyden, 1959, p. 85: \"both as a question of theory and as a matter of principle nothing in the present Convention prohibits its provisions to be interpreted and applied to individual cases of murder by reason of the national, racial, ethnical or religious qualities of the single victim if the murderous attack was done with the intent to commit similar acts in the future and in connection with the first crime\".\n\n148. The French word \"délibéré\" was dropped further to a proposal of Belgium (UN Off. Doc. A/C.6/217, UN Doc. A/C.6/SR.72 p. 8).\n\n149. On this point, see inter alia the commentary of J. Graven, op. cit., p. 495.\"\n\nProsecutor v. George Rutaganda, Case No. ICTR-97-20-T, Judgement (TC), 6 December 1999, paras. 59, 525:\n\n\"59. Genocide is distinct from other crimes because it requires dolus specialis, a special intent. Special intent of a crime is the specific intention which, as an element of the crime, requires that the perpetrator clearly intended the result charged. The dolus specialis of the crime of genocide lies in \"the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such\". A person may be convicted of genocide only where it is established that he committed one of the acts referred to under Article 2(2) of the Statute with the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular group.\"\n\n\"525. The crime of genocide sometimes implies several offenders participating in the commission of the crime. The Appeals Chamber concurs with the Appellant that in order to find a person guilty of genocide, it must be established that such a person was personally possessed of the specific intent to commit the crime at the time he did so. Nonetheless, as stated by the Appeals Chamber in Kayishema/Ruzindana, \"explicit manifestations of criminal intent are […] often rare in the context of criminal trials\".983 In the absence of explicit, direct proof, the dolus specialis may therefore be inferred from relevant facts and circumstances.984 Such an approach prevents perpetrators from escaping convictions simply because such manifestations are absent.985 The validity of this interpretation was confirmed by the Appeals Chambers of both ad hoc Tribunals.986 With respect to the facts and circumstances from which specific intent may be inferred, the ICTY Appeals Chamber in Jelisić stated that such facts are, inter alia:\n\nThe ICTY Appeals Chamber also indicated that the existence of a plan or policy is not \"a legal ingredient\" of the crime of genocide,988 but that proving the existence of such a plan or policy may facilitate proof of the crime.989 Moreover, the Kayishema/Ruzindana Appeal Judgement reveals that making anti-Tutsi utterances or being affiliated to an extremist anti-Tutsi group is not a sine qua non for establishing dolus specialis.990 The Appeals Chamber holds the view that establishing such a fact may, nonetheless, facilitate proof of specific intent.\"\n\n\"983.

A distinguishing aspect of the crime of genocide is the specific intent (dolus specialis) to destroy a group in whole or in part. The dolus specialis applies to all acts of genocide mentioned in Article 2(a) to (e) of the Statute, that is, all the enumerated acts must be committed ‘with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.’ It is this specific intent that distinguishes the crime of genocide from the ordinary crime of murder.38 The Trial Chamber opines that for the crime of genocide to occur, the mens rea must be formed prior to the commission of the genocidal acts. The individual acts themselves, however, do not require premeditation; the only consideration is that the act should be done in furtherance of the genocidal intent.\"\n\n\"38. Virginia Morris and Michael Scharf, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA, 167 (1998)\"\n\nProsecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu, Case No. ICTR-96-4-T, Judgement (TC), 2 September 1998, paras. 498, 518 – 522:\n\n\"498. Genocide is distinct from other crimes inasmuch as it embodies a special intent or dolus specialis. Special intent of a crime is the specific intention, required as a constitutive element of the crime, which demands that the perpetrator clearly seeks to produce the act charged. Thus, the special intent in the crime of genocide lies in \"the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such\".\"\n\n\"518. Special intent is a well-known criminal law concept in the Roman-continental legal systems. It is required as a constituent element of certain offences and demands that the perpetrator have the clear intent to cause the offence charged. According to this meaning, special intent is the key element of an intentional offence, which offence is characterized by a psychological relationship between the physical result and the mental state of the perpetrator98.\n\n519. As observed by the representative of Brazil during the travaux préparatoires of the Genocide Convention,\n\n520. With regard to the crime of genocide, the offender is culpable only when he has committed one of the offences charged under Article 2(2) of the Statute with the clear intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular group. The offender is culpable because he knew or should have known that the act committed would destroy, in whole or in part, a group.\n\n521. In concrete terms, for any of the acts charged under Article 2 (2) of the Statute to be a constitutive element of genocide, the act must have been committed against one or several individuals, because such individual or individuals were members of a specific group, and specifically because they belonged to this group. Thus, the victim is chosen not because of his individual identity, but rather on account of his membership of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. The victim of the act is therefore a member of a group, chosen as such, which, hence, means that the victim of the crime of genocide is the group itself and not only the individual100.\n\n522. The perpetration of the act charged therefore extends beyond its actual commission, for example, the murder of a particular individual, for the realisation of an ulterior motive, which is to destroy, in whole or part, the group of which the individual is just one element.\"\n\n\"98.

S/2005/60, 25 January 2005, paras. 502 – 504:\n\n\"502. Proof of genocidal intent. Whenever direct evidence of genocidal intent is lacking, as is mostly the case, this intent can be inferred from many acts and manifestations or factual circumstances.185 In Jelisić the Appeals Chamber noted that \"as to proof of specific intent, it may, in the absence of direct explicit evidence, be inferred from a number of facts and circumstances, such as the general context, the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against the same group, the scale of atrocities committed, the systematic targeting of victims on account of their membership of a particular group, or the repetition of destructive and discriminatory acts\" (§ 47).\n\n503. Courts and other bodies charged with establishing whether genocide has occurred must however be very careful in the determination of the subjective intent. As the ICTY Appeals Chamber rightly put it in Krstić (Appeal), \"Genocide is one of the worst crimes known to humankind, and its gravity is reflected in the stringent requirements of specific intent. Convictions for genocide can be entered only where intent has been unequivocally established\" (Judgment of 19 April 2004, at § 134). On this ground the Appeals Chamber, finding that the Trial Chamber had erred in demonstrating that the accused possessed the genocidal intent, reversed the Trial Chamber’s conviction of genocide and sentenced Krstić for complicity in genocide.\n\n504. Similarly, States have shown caution when defining genocidal intent with regard to particular events, as is shown, for instance, by the position the Canadian authorities took in 1999 with regard to the question of mass killing of Kosovar Albanians by the armed forces of the central authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in the internal armed conflict between Kosovo and the Government of the FRY.186\"\n\n\"[1]85. See Jelisić (Appeals Chamber), at § 47; Rutaganda (Appeals Chamber), at § 528; Krstić (Appeals Chamber), at § 34. A number of factors from which intent may be inferred were mentioned in Akayesu (§§523-4: \"the general context of the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against that same group, whether . . . committed by the same offender or by others\"; \"the scale of atrocities committed\"; the \"general nature\" of the atrocities committed \"in a region or a country\" ; \"the fact of deliberately and systematically targeting victims on account of their membership of a particular group, while excluding the members of other groups\"; \"the general political doctrine which gave rise to the acts\" ;\"the repetition of destructive and discriminatory acts\" or \"the perpetration of acts which violate, or which the perpetrators themselves consider to violate the very foundation of the group—acts which are not in themselves covered by the list.…but which are committed as part of the same pattern of conduct.\"), in Musema (§ 166) as well as Kayishema and Ruzindana (§§ 93 and 527: \"the number of group members affected\" ;\"the physical targeting of the group or their property\"; \"the use of derogatory language toward members of the targeted group\"; \"the weapons employed and the extent of bodily injury\"; \"the methodical way of planning\"; \"the systematic manner of killing\" and \"the relative proportionate scale of the actual or attempted destruction of a group.\").\n\n[1]86. In a Memorandum of 30 March 1999, the Legal Bureau of the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs pointed out first that in the case of the Kosovar Albanians one element of genocide was present (\"targeting a group on the basis of ethnicity\"). Then, after noting that so-called ethnic cleansing has been expressly excluded from the Genocide Convention in the 1948 negotiations, it pointed that that such notion (namely the forcible expulsion of person from their homes in order to escape the threat of subsequent ill-treatment), showed an intent different from the \"intent to destroy\". It went on note that \"Ethnic Albanians are being killed and injured in order to drive them from their homes, not in order to destroy them as a group, in whole or in part\" (in 37 Canadian Yearkook of International Law 1999, at 328; emphasis in the original).\"\n\nB. Evidentiary comment:\n\nDespite a passage in the Akeyasu Trial Judgment suggesting that the mental element for genocide would be established where it was shown that the perpetrator had actual or constructive knoweldge that acts would cause destruction of the group (\"With regard to the crime of genocide, the offender is culpable only when he has committed one of the offences charged under Article 2(2) of the Statute with the clear intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular group. The offender is culpable because he knew or should have known that the act committed would destroy, in whole or in part, a group\"; para 519), it is now well established in the case law of the Tribunals that this is not the case. Rather, the perpetrator himself must seek, by the acts in question, to achieve the group’s destruction (see especially Jelisić Appeals Judgment, para. 46).\n\nRegarding the assessmente of the requisite intent, all sources acknowledge that it may be difficult to find explicit manifestations of intent by the perpetrators (direct evidence). Whenever direct evidence of genocidal intent is lacking, as is mostly the case, this intent can be inferred from many acts and manifestations or factual circumstances.\n\nHowever, although the mental element requirements are strict, there is no additional requirement to prove premeditation (see Kayishema Trial Judgment, para. 91; Semanza Trial Judgment, para. 319; Krstić Trial Judgment, para. 572, Jelisić Trial Judgment, para. 100).\n\n2.1.1. Evidence inferred from the words, deeds or position of the perpetrator.\n\nA. Legal source/authority and evidence:\n\nProsecutor v. Ildéphonse Nizeyimana, Case No. ICTR-00-55C-A, Judgment (AC) 29 September 2014, paras. 122-125:\n\n\"122. The Appeals Chamber also rejects Nizeyimana’s contentions regarding the reasons for his anger at the presence of the Ruhutinyanya family in the ESO camp and his disgust at the resources spent on protecting the Tutsi family. In light of the Trial Chamber’s acceptance of the evidence that Nizeyimana characterized the Ruhutinyanya family as Inyenzi/Inkotanyi, and the gendarmesaccompanying them as accomplices,391 the Appeals Chamber considers that the Trial Chamber reasonably concluded that Nizeyimana’s response to the presence of the family and the resources expended upon them was motivated by genocidal intent.\n\n391. See Trial Judgement, paras. 127, 131, 139, 165, 179, 191, 198, 199, 1495, fn. 415.\n\n123. With regard to the Trial Chamber’s reference to Nizeyimana’s role in the Cyahinda Parish attack,392 the Appeals Chamber notes its conclusion, by Majority, below that the Trial Chamber erred in finding that Nizeyimana was actively involved in authorizing and planning this attack.393 Nevertheless, the Appeals Chamber does not consider that this calls into question the Trial Chamber’s overall assessment of Nizeyimana’s mens rea with regard to the killing of the Ruhutinyanya family, particularly as the Trial Chamber’s observation of its conclusions on the Cyahinda Parish attack – which were based on separate findings – was made only after it had already concluded that Nizeyimana acted with the requisite knowledge and intent.394 Likewise, in its legal findings concerning the killing of the Ruhutinyanya family, the Trial Chamber independently concluded that Nizeyimana possessed genocidal intent and was aware of the genocidal intent held by the principal perpetrators,395 before considering that these findings were further bolstered by evidence of Nizeyimana’s disgust towards the Ruhutinyanya family, and before finally comparing this attitude with that purportedly exhibited in relation to the Cyahinda Parish attack.396 The Appeals Chamber therefore finds that the Trial Chamber’s reference to Nizeyimana’s role in the Cyahinda Parish attack was an additional consideration reinforcing its conclusion on Nizeyimana’s mens rea. In light of this, the Appeals Chamber does not consider that the Trial Chamber’s reference to this attack is capable of invalidating its independent finding that Nizeyimana had the requisite knowledge and intent regarding the killing of the Ruhutinyanya family.\n\n392. Trial Judgement, para. 199.\n\n393. See infra para. 158.\n\n394. Trial Judgement, para. 198 (“The only reasonable inference is that the very danger the Ruhutinyanya family had faced at the roadblock was the reason why Nizeyimana ordered ESO soldiers to return the family to that very location.”). See also Trial Judgement, para. 199 (discussing Nizeyimana’s “anger” and “disgust” towards the Ruhutinyanya family’s presence, before comparing such “disgust” with that exhibited in relation to the Cyahinda Parish attack).\n\n395. Trial Judgement, para. 1496.\n\n396. Trial Judgement, para. 1497.\n\n124. The Appeals Chamber also dismisses Nizeyimana’s arguments that the Trial Chamber erred in finding that Bizimana led the mission back to the Akanyaru border crossing roadblock. Contrary to Nizeyimana’s submissions, Witness ZML07’s evidence that Bizimana led the mission was corroborated by other evidence.397 The Trial Chamber noted that, contrary to the evidence ofWitnesses ZAW and AZD, Witness ZML07 testified that Nyirimanzi was not involved.398 However, the fact that Nizeyimana ordered Nyirimanzi to return the family to the border does not undermine the finding that it was Bizimana who led the mission. Moreover, as discussed above, the Trial Chamber considered and reasonably rejected the evidence that Muvunyi arranged the removal of the family.399 The Appeals Chamber further finds that the Trial Chamber was entitled to rely on evidence of Bizimana’s role in Rosalie Gicanda’s murder to infer intent, by demonstrating a pattern of targeted violence, including the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against the same protected group, i.e., Tutsis. This also reinforced the Trial Chamber’s finding of the genocidal intent of the ESO soldiers and Interahamwe at the roadblock,400 as well as Nizeyimana’s mens rea for the killing of the Ruhutinyanya family members.401\n\n397. Trial Judgement, paras. 152, 156. See also Trial Judgement, para. 160.\n\n398. Trial Judgement, para. 196. Furthermore, the Trial Chamber considered in detail the evidence of Witnesses ZAW and AZD regarding Nizeyimana’s order to Nyirimanzi to return the family to the border. See Trial Judgement, paras. 162, 179, 187-190.\n\n399. See supra para. 119. See also Trial Judgement, paras. 195, 196.400. Trial Judgement, para. 1495.\n\n401. Trial Judgement, para. 208. Cf.

Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber does not consider that Nizeyimana has demonstrated that the Trial Chamber erred in its assessment of the mens rea underlying his conviction for the killing of the Ruhutinyanya family.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Mikaeli Muhimana, Case No. ICTR-95-1B-T, Judgement (TC), 28 April 2005, para. 496:\n\n\"496. The perpetrator’s specific genocidal intent may be inferred from deeds and utterances. It may also be inferred from the general context of the perpetration, in consideration of factors such as: the systematic manner of killing; the methodical way of planning; the general nature of the atrocities, including their scale and geographical location, weapons employed in an attack, and the extent of bodily injuries; the targeting of property belonging to members of the group; the use of derogatory language towards members of the group; and other culpable acts systematically directed against the same group, whether committed by the perpetrator or others.\"\n\n\"455.

The Defence also argues that the record contains no statements by members of the VRS Main Staff indicating that the killing of the Bosnian Muslim men was motivated by genocidal intent to destroy the Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica.55 The absence of such statements is not determinative. Where direct evidence of genocidal intent is absent, the intent may still be inferred from the factual circumstances of the crime.56 The inference that a particular atrocity was motivated by genocidal intent may be drawn, moreover, even where the individuals to whom the intent is attributable are not precisely identified. If the crime committed satisfies the other requirements of genocide, and if the evidence supports the inference that the crime was motivated by the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a protected group, a finding that genocide has occurred may be entered.\"\n\n\"55.

Thus evidence of the context of the alleged culpable acts may help the Chamber to determine the intention of the Accused, especially where the intention of a person is not clear from what that person says or does. The Chamber notes, however, that the use of context to determine the intent of an accused must be counterbalanced with the actual conduct of the Accused.

Regarding the assessment of the requisite intent, the Trial Chamber acknowledges that it may be difficult to find explicit manifestations of intent by the perpetrators. The perpetrator’s actions, including circumstantial evidence, however may provide sufficient evidence of intent. The Commission of Experts in their Final Report on the situation in Rwanda also noted this difficulty.

As stated in its findings on the law applicable to the crime of genocide, the Chamber holds the view that the intent underlying an act can be inferred from a number of facts179. The Chamber is of the opinion that it is possible to infer the genocidal intention that presided over the commission of a particular act, inter alia, from all acts or utterances of the accused, or from the general context in which other culpable acts were perpetrated systematically against the same group, regardless of whether such other acts were committed by the same perpetrator or even by other perpetrators.\"\n\n\"179. 1 See above the findings of the Trial Chamber on the law applicable to the crime of genocide.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Vujadin Popovic, Case No. IT-05-88-A, Judgement (AC), 30 January 2015, paras. 36-37, 469-472, 507, 514-522, 525-530:\n\n\"36. The Prosecution responds that the Indictment was clear that the forcible transfer allegations against Miletic included the civilian component of the column and those among the column who were later executed.128\"\n\n128. Prosecution’s Response Brief (Miletic), paras 5-9, 16. See also Prosecution’s Response Brief (Miletic), paras 10-15.\n\n\"37. With regard to the column, the Appeals Chamber notes that the section of the Indictment under the sub-heading “The Forcible Removal of the Muslim Population from Srebrenica” could, when read in isolation, be understood to pertain only to the men from the column who were captured or who surrendered to MUP or VRS forces.129 However, the Appeals Chamber recalls that when considering whether an accused received clear and timely notice, the indictment must be considered as a whole.130 To this end, the Appeals Chamber observes that under Count 7, the Indictment alleges that the purpose of the JCE to enclaves”. 131 Under the sub-heading “The Joint Criminal Enterprise to Forcibly Remove the Muslim Population from Srebrenica and Zepa”, it further alleges that one purpose of the 2 July 1995 VRS attack on the Srebrenica enclave was to force the Muslim population into the small town of Srebrenica “thereby creat[ing] conditions where it would be impossible for the entire Muslim population to sustain itself, and that would require its departure”.132 Thus, the Indictment is clear that the target of the JCE to Forcibly Remove extended to the entire Bosnian Muslim population of Srebrenica. It necessarily follows that the target of the JCE included those Bosnian Muslims who would eventually flee Srebrenica in the column. Paragraph 56 under the same sub-heading of the Indictment reinforces such an understanding in that the description of the JCE includes “approximately 15,000 Bosnian Muslim men from the enclave, with some women and children, […] [including approximately 5,000] armed Bosnian Muslim military personnel” amassed in a column and headed towards Tuzla.133\"\n\n129.

Concerning Popovic’s argument regarding his support for opening the corridor, the Appeals Chamber notes the Trial Chamber’s finding that Popović was referring to Pandurević’s Interim Combat Report of 16 July 1995 when stating that “[i]t’s just like he wrote it … I was there on the spot and saw for myself he had received some numbers”.1300 As found by the Trial Chamber, this report contains information on combat operations in the Zvornik area as well as Pandurevic’s decision to open a corridor so that the civilian population could be evacuated.1301 The Appeals Chamber finds that Popovic has failed to demonstrate that the Trial Chamber erred in finding that his words reflect his agreement with how Pandurević described the combat operations rather than his support for Pandurević’s decision to open the corridor. In any event, the Trial Chamber weighed the evidence and relied on Popović’s cumulative actions and words to show his genocidal intent.1302 Thus, this argument is dismissed.\"\n\n1300. Trial Judgement, para. 1136. See Trial Judgement, paras 1137-1138.\n\n1301.

Regarding Popović’s use of the term “balija”, the Trial Chamber found that it was “in no way determinative of his alleged specific intent to commit genocide, though it is relevant to it”.1303 The Appeals Chamber observes that his use of the term “balija” did not form part of the “decisive factors” in the Trial Chamber’s finding that Popović had genocidal intent.1304 The Appeals Chamber finds that Popović challenges the Trial Chamber’s reliance on certain evidence, without explaining why the conviction should not stand on the basis of the remaining evidence and, therefore, dismisses his argument.\"\n\n1303. Trial Judgement, para. 1177.\n\n1304. See Trial Judgement, para. 1180.\n\n\"471. The Trial Chamber found that “Popović aimed to spare no one amongst the Bosnian Muslims within his reach, not even a young boy”.1305 This impugned finding was based on other findings regarding, notably, Popović’s involvement in co-ordinating the Orahovac killings on 14 July 1995 and the Kozluk Killings on 15 July 1995.1306 Specifically, the Trial Chamber found that when a young boy emerged from a pile of corpses at the Orahovac execution site, calling for his father, Popović asked the executioners what they were waiting for and said “[j]ust finish him off”.1307 In this regard, the Appeals Chamber notes that it dismisses below Popović’s challenges to the Trial Chamber’s findings that he was present at this execution site.1308 The Trial Chamber further found that once someone had volunteered to participate in the executions that were to take place at Kozluk, Popović told the volunteer to go out and find other volunteers. 1309 The Appeals Chamber considers that Popović has failed to demonstrate that no reasonable trial chamber could have made the impugned finding based on its previous findings on Popović’s involvement in the Orahovac killings and Kozluk Killings. The Appeals Chamber further observes that the Trial Chamber did not rely on Popović’s authority regarding the prisoners to find his genocidal intent and instead relied on his actions and statements.1310 Whether he had any specific authority over the prisoners is therefore irrelevant to the impugned finding and, by extension, to the Trial Chamber’s findings on his genocidal intent. The Appeals Chamber therefore dismisses Popović’s challenge to the impugned finding.\"\n\n1305. Trial Judgement, para. 1179, referring to Trial Judgement, paras 1111-1122.\n\n1306.

Finally, the Appeals Chamber has upheld all of the other findings on which Popović alleges the Trial Chamber based his conviction for commission of genocide.1311 The Appeals Chamber therefore dismisses Popovic’s arguments.\"\n\n1311. See infra, paras 813-815, 819, 822, 831, 845, 847, 874, 904, 910, 1077-1078, 1103-1104, 1107-1108, 1143, 1153-1154, 1196-1197.\n\n\"507. In sum, the Prosecution has not demonstrated that the Trial Chamber erred by failing to consider relevant factors in determining whether Nikolic possessed genocidal intent. To the extent that the Prosecution’s arguments could be interpreted as being that the Trial Chamber failed to give sufficient weight to the relevant factors it considered or failed to interpret the evidence in a particular manner, the Appeals Chamber recalls that such mere assertions warrant dismissal without detailed analysis. The Appeals Chamber will therefore not address the Prosecution’s arguments in this light.\"\n\n\"514. The Appeals Chamber recalls that where the Prosecution appeals an acquittal it must show that, when account is taken of the errors of fact committed by the Trial Chamber, all reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt has been eliminated.1437 Thus, in requesting the Appeals Chamber to overturn an acquittal for genocide based on alleged errors of fact underpinning a trial chamber’s finding of a lack of the requisite mens rea, the Prosecution needs to show that, but for the Trial Chamber’s errors, the specific intent for genocide would have been unequivocally established. Bearing this in mind, the Appeals Chamber will consider this sub-ground of appeal on its merits.\"\n\n1437. See supra, para. 21.\n\n\"515. First, with regard to the averred irrelevant legal considerations, the Appeals Chamber notes that the Trial Chamber considered Nikolic’s personal circumstances and position within the VRS as relevant to assessing his personal intent to destroy a group by placing his participation in the context in which it clearly occurred.1438 In the view of the Appeals Chamber, it is clear from the Trial Chamber’s analysis that it did not draw a simple conclusion on the lack of genocidal intent by reason of Nikolic’s subordinate position within the VRS, but made a careful assessment of Nikolic’s role and position at the relevant time, which formed part of the evidence in totality. In this sense, the Trial Chamber found it relevant that Nikolic was a lower ranking military officer who was occupying a position of some importance in terms of functionality – the Chief of Security in the Zvornik Brigade. Contrary to the Prosecution’s submission,1439 the Trial Chamber did not fail to reflect the degree of authority that Nikolic practically enjoyed and exercised in this position – indeed it specifically noted that the position was usually reserved for the rank of Major or higher.1440 The Trial Chamber observed, however, that “in the context of an operation directed by Beara and Popovic, Nikolic would have little authority of his own”.1441 By reason of his position, Nikolic was ordered by his superiors to make logistical arrangements for the detention and killing of prisoners in the Zvornik area.1442 The Trial Chamber also accepted evidence that Nikolic was devoted to the Security Service.1443 As noted by the Trial Chamber, such factors do not justify or excuse the carrying out of patently illegal orders.1444 In this regard, such factors are irrelevant to determining individual criminal responsibility.1445 However, evidence of Nikolic’s personal circumstances and position in the VRS formed part of “all of the evidence, taken together” which may be assessed to determine the existence of genocidal intent.1446 The Appeals Chamber finds that such evidence was not legally irrelevant to the Trial Chamber’s assessment of whether Nikolic personally had genocidal intent.\"\n\n1438.

With regard to the Prosecution’s argument that the Trial Chamber erred in law by considering that Nikolic’s possible motive for participating in the genocidal plan undermined his genocidal intent, the Appeals Chamber does not construe the Trial Chamber’s assertion that “[a]nother reasonable inference is that Nikolić’s blind dedication to the Security Service led him to doggedly pursue the efficient execution of his assigned tasks in this operation, despite its murderous nature and the genocidal aim of his superiors”1447 to mean that the Trial Chamber confused intent and motive or that it concluded that the existence of a motive would be incompatible with genocidal intent.1448 The Appeals Chamber considers that the Trial Chamber held that the Prosecution had not established genocidal intent beyond reasonable doubt.\"\n\n1447. Trial Judgement, para. 1414.\n\n1448. See Krnojelac Appeal Judgement, para. 103\n\n\"517. The Appeals Chamber now turns to the submission that the Trial Chamber considered irrelevant factual considerations. The Prosecution argues that the Trial Chamber erroneously focused on what Nikolic could have done, instead of what he did and how he did it,1449 as well as on Nikolic’s lack of involvement in criminal acts that were completed prior to his joining the murder operation.1450 The Appeals Chamber notes that the Trial Chamber found that, although Nikolić’s “acts and participation […] provide some evidence from which a genocidal intent on his part could be inferred”,1451 “Beara and Popović can properly be described as architects of this genocidal operation, [while] Nikolić was brought in to carry out specific tasks assigned to him, in implementation of a monstrous plan, designed by others.”1452 The Trial Chamber did not discount the significance of what Nikolic did, nor unreasonably compare his contributions to those of Beara and Popovic, nor require that Nikolic participate in criminal acts that were completed before he joined the genocide. Rather, the Trial Chamber specifically focused on the scope of Nikolic’s acts and participation for the purpose of determining whether and to what extent genocidal intent could be inferred. This does not mean that the Trial Chamber failed to appreciate that a genocidal plan involves a division of tasks.1453 While the Trial Chamber may have placed undue emphasis on all of Nikolic’s tasks being confined to his sphere of military role and authority as a factor relevant to determining whether he had genocidal intent, it considered the scope of Nikolic’s acts and participation together with a range of other evidence that suggested to it that there were other reasonable inferences that could be drawn about his mental state than that of genocidal intent.1454 The Appeals Chamber recalls that where proof of state of mind is based on inference, it must be the only reasonable inference available on the evidence. 1455 The Trial Chamber’s consideration of the specific tasks assigned to Nikolic in the context of the genocidal operation as a whole was part of the totality of the evidence and therefore relevant to determining whether genocidal intent was the only reasonable inference available on the evidence. The Appeals Chamber therefore concludes that the Prosecution misconstrues the Trial Chamber’s basic reasoning.\"\n\n1449.

As to the Prosecution’s argument that the Trial Chamber contradicted its prior findings related to Nikolic’s involvement in the movement of prisoners from Bratunac to Zvornik,1456 the Appeals Chamber notes that when discussing Nikolic’s possible mens rea for committing genocide and conspiracy to commit genocide, the Trial Chamber found that, “[w]hile he had some escort responsibilities, he was not implicated in the arrangements for the movement of the prisoners from Bratunac to Zvornik”.1457 The Appeals Chamber notes that this appears to contradict the Trial Chamber’s earlier findings that Nikolic was heavily involved in organising the movement of these prisoners to Zvornik, by: (1) calling Obrenović on the evening of 13 July 1995 to tell him that Popovic had informed him of the large number of prisoners that would be transferred from Bratunac to Zvornik in order to be executed on Mladić’s orders and that Nikolić had been asked to assist (“Nikolić-Obrenović Conversation”); (2) requesting Obrenovic to assign to him Miomir Jašikovac and a military police platoon to carry out the task; and (3) supervising the operation by personally being present when the buses of prisoners arrived and assigning the Zvornik Brigade Military Police Company to guard the prisoners.1458\"\n\n1456.

The Prosecution also argues that the Trial Chamber contradicted an earlier finding when, in the context of assessing Nikolic’s mens rea for genocide, it considered that “he is not directly implicated in the killings at Branjevo Military Farm”.1459 The Appeals Chamber notes the Trial Chamber’s earlier finding that “Nikolić ordered Perić of the Zvornik Brigade 1st Battalion to secure the prisoners at the Kula School in the awareness that these prisoners were to be executed.”1460 The Trial Chamber specified that “it is immaterial that Nikolić went to a funeral on 16 July 1995 on the day that they were killed at Branjevo Military Farm”.1461 In the view of the Appeals Chamber, in making this remark, the Trial Chamber was indicating that Nikolic was in fact implicated in the murders of these prisoners, in spite of the fact that he was not present on the day they were killed. The Appeals Chamber considers that this contradicts its later finding that Nikolic was not directly implicated in the killings at the Branjevo Military Farm.\"\n\n1459. Prosecution’s Appeal Brief, para. 282; Trial Judgement, para. 1410.\n\n1460. Trial Judgement, para. 1360. Cf. infra, paras 1327-1328.\n\n1461. Trial Judgement, para. 1360.\n\n\"520. The Appeals Chamber therefore finds that the Trial Chamber did contradict two of its earlier findings in discussing considerations militating against finding that Nikolic had the requisite genocidal intent. However, neither of these later contradictory findings necessarily amount to an error of fact which has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. In this regard, the Appeals Chamber notes Nikolic’s involvement in the arrangements for moving the prisoners from Bratunac to Zvornik and his role in securing the prisoners at the Kula School with the knowledge they would be later executed. The Appeals Chamber, however, finds that the Prosecution has failed to show that the Trial Chamber erred in its overall reasoning that genocidal intent was not the only reasonable inference available from the evidence as it relates to Nikolic’s mental state in carrying out the specific tasks assigned to him by reason of his military and security positions.\"\n\n\"521. The Prosecution argues that the Trial Chamber also unreasonably considered as a factor negating Nikolic’s possible genocidal intent the fact that the Milići Prisoners remained alive in his custody until they were handed over to Popovic. 1462 The Appeals Chamber observes that the Trial Chamber was unable to make precise findings on the role, if any, that Nikolic had in terms of the custody of the Milići Prisoners or their handover to Popovic. 1463 Considering the lack of evidence or findings on Nikolic’s role in the matter, the Appeals Chamber is of the view that no reasonable trier of fact could have relied on the fact that the prisoners remained alive in the custody of the Zvornik Brigade to counter the inference that Nikolic had genocidal intent.1464 At the same time, the Appeals Chamber finds that the incident does not necessarily provide support for Nikolic’s genocidal intent.1465 However, the Appeals Chamber finds that the Trial Chamber’s erroneous reliance on this evidence did not amount to a miscarriage of justice since the Trial Chamber based its reasoning on a wide range of evidence in addition to this one consideration. Thus, the absence of this consideration in the Trial Chamber’s discussion would not have altered the Trial Chamber’s conclusion that more than one inference about Nikolic’s mental state was reasonable.\"\n\n1462. Prosecution’s Appeal Brief, paras 283-284; Prosecution’s Reply Brief, para. 118. See Trial Judgement, para. 1411.\n\n1463. Trial Judgement, para. 1380.\n\n1464. Trial Judgement, para. 1411.\n\n1465. See Prosecution’s Appeal Brief, para. 283.\n\n\"522. Finally, the Appeals Chamber finds that the errors discussed above1466 are insufficient to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice even when taken cumulatively.\"\n\n1466. See supra, paras 520-521.\n\n\"525. The Appeals Chamber notes that the Trial Chamber made reference to all four of the considerations enumerated by the Prosecution in assessing Nikolic’s mens rea for committing genocide and conspiracy to commit genocide. In terms of Nikolic’s awareness of the genocidal plan, it found that “soon after the inception of his involvement in the killing operation, and certainly by the time of executions at Orahovac, Nikolić knew that this was a massive killing operation being carried out with a genocidal intent”.1478\n\n1478. Trial Judgement, para. 1407.\n\n\"526. The Trial Chamber also found that Nikolic’s key contributions to the genocide were made concurrent with, or after the acquisition of, this knowledge.1479 These key contributions consisted of the planning and organising of detentions and executions of thousands of prisoners in multiple locations in the Zvornik area.1480 Furthermore, the Trial Chamber specifically considered the persistent and determined efforts of Nikolic to contribute to this plan.1481 With all of this in mind, the Trial Chamber determined that “the central issue, however, is whether those actions, combined with his knowledge of the genocidal intent of others, considered in the totality of the evidence, are sufficient to satisfy the Trial Chamber beyond reasonable doubt that Nikolić not only knew of the intent but that he shared it”.1482\"\n\n1479. Trial Judgement, para. 1407.\n\n1480. Trial Judgement, paras 1404, 1408.\n\n1481. Trial Judgement, paras 1408-1409.\n\n1482. Trial Judgement, para. 1408.\n\n\"527. Ultimately, the Trial Chamber was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Nikolic shared the genocidal intent of which he was aware since this was not the only reasonable inference it could draw from the evidence, another being that “Nikolic’s blind dedication to the Security Service led him to doggedly pursue the efficient execution of his assigned tasks in this operation, despite its murderous nature and the genocidal aim of his superiors.”1483\"\n\n1483. Trial Judgement, para. 1414\n\n\"528. The Appeals Chamber recalls the margin of deference it gives to the factual findings reached by a trial chamber and that it will only intervene when a clear error has been made.1484 The Appeals Chamber, Judge Niang dissenting, is not convinced that the errors made by the Trial Chamber in the course of its reasoning on Nikolic’s possible mens rea for genocide or conspiracy to commit genocide undermine the conclusions reached by the Trial Chamber.1485\"\n\n1484. See supra, para. 513.\n\n1485. See supra, paras 520-522.\n\n\"529. The Appeals Chamber, Judge Niang dissenting, finds that the Prosecution has failed to show that the Trial Chamber erred in concluding that Nikolic did not possess the requisite genocidal intent so as to hold him responsible for genocide as well as conspiracy to commit genocide. The Appeals Chamber recalls that the crimes of genocide and conspiracy to commit genocide both require genocidal intent as a part of the mens rea element,1486 and in the absence of such a finding of genocidal intent, it is unnecessary to discuss the submissions of the Parties on the actus reus of conspiracy to commit genocide.1487\"\n\n\"530. In light of the foregoing, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Niang dissenting, dismisses the Prosecution’s ground of appeal 7 in its entirety.\"\n\n1486. In order for the mens rea for conspiracy to commit genocide to be satisfied “the individuals involved in the agreement must have the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such (mens rea)”. Nahimana et al. Appeal Judgement, para. 894. Likewise, for genocide an accused must act “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such”. Munyakazi Appeal Judgement, para. 141\n\n1487. The Appeals Chamber also considers that Nikolić’s arguments on the possible violation of his fundamental right to appeal, as resulting from the entering of a new conviction on appeal, is rendered moot.

Emmanuel Rukundo, Case No. ICTR-2001-70-A, Judgement (AC), 20 October 2010, paras. 235-238 (Below).\n\n\"572. Considering the general context of violence against the Tutsi in Gitarama préfecture and in Kabgayi, and, in particular, Rukundo’s participation in the systematic abduction and killing of Tutsi refugees at the St. Léon Minor Seminary on the basis of lists, as well as his statement that \"something had to be done\" about RPF sympathizers, the Chamber finds beyond reasonable doubt that Rukundo, when committing these crimes, possessed the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.\"\n\n\"575. Considering the general context of mass violence against the Tutsi in Gitarama préfecture and in Kabgayi, and, specifically, Rukundo’s words spoken prior to assaulting Witness CCH, that her entire family had to be killed for assisting the Inyenzi, the Chamber finds that Rukundo possessed the intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, the Tutsi ethnic group.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Emmanuel Rukundo, Case No. ICTR-2001-70-A, Judgement (AC), 20 October 2010, paras. 235-238:\n\n\"235. Central to the Trial Chamber’s finding of genocidal intent was Rukundo’s assertion that Witness CCH’s family had to be killed because one of her relatives was assisting the \"Inyenzi\". While evidence concerning the use of expressions such as \"Inyenzi\" can, in some circumstances, suffice to establish genocidal intent,576 the Appeals Chamber recalls that inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence must be the only reasonable inference available.577 In this particular context, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, considers that genocidal intent is not the only reasonable inference to be drawn from Rukundo’s assertion. In particular, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, observes that Rukundo’s language can plausibly be interpreted as expressing anger that a former friend was affiliated with the \"Inyenzi\", without signifying a personal desire to destroy Tutsis.578 This interpretation is supported by the fact that Rukundo’s statement did not frighten Witness CCH; according to her evidence, she only became frightened when Rukundo locked her in his room prior to assaulting her.579 The Appeals Chamber also notes that, after they entered the room together, Rukundo told Witness CCH that if he could have hidden her, he would have done so.580\n\n236. The Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, also considers that the \"general context of mass violence\" cited by the Trial Chamber is insufficient to justify a finding of genocidal intent with respect to this incident. The Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, observes that the crime committed against Witness CCH was qualitatively different from the other acts of genocide perpetrated by Rukundo. In its analysis of events at Saint Joseph’s College and the Saint Léon Minor Seminary, the Trial Chamber relied on the systematic, repeated searches for Tutsis on the basis of identity cards or lists, and the subsequent killing or assault of those individuals removed, to conclude that the perpetrators, including Rukundo, had genocidal intent.581 By contrast, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, considers that Rukundo’s sexual assault of Witness CCH appears to have been unplanned and spontaneous.582 In this context, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, finds that his act could reasonably be construed as an opportunistic crime that was not accompanied by the specific intent to commit genocide. While this analysis does not alter the highly degrading and non-consensual nature of the act committed, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, considers that it supports the inference that Rukundo’s sexual assault, while taking place during a genocide, was not necessarily a part of the genocide itself.583\n\n237. In light of this equivocal evidence, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, finds that no reasonable trier of fact could find that the only reasonable inference available from the evidence was that Rukundo possessed genocidal intent in relation to the sexual assault of Witness CCH. Consequently, the Appeals Chamber does not need to address Rukundo’s remaining arguments under this ground of appeal.\n\n238. Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Pocar dissenting, grants Rukundo’s Eighth Ground of Appeal and reverses his conviction for genocide, in part, for causing serious mental harm to Witness CCH. 580\"\n\n577 Ntagerura et al. Appeal Judgement, para. 306.\n\n578 T. 13 February 2007 p. 58 (\"I said hello to him, I introduced myself, and I told him that Father […] was a relative of mine, and then I asked him for protection, I asked him to hide me. And he answered as follows: ‘If Father […] is your relative, then you all have to die, because Father […] was assisting Inyenzi. He was my friend, but when he started helping the Inyenzi, he is no longer my friend. We do not even talk to each other. He’s no longer my friend.’ He went on to say that they had found some documents at Louis Rudahunga's place and who had to be killed, and that this document included a list of people who were making financial contributions to the Inkotanyi.\").\n\n579 See T. 14 February 2007 p. 19 (\"If I told the Prosecutor that I was afraid, I was not afraid to carry the carton. I became afraid when I saw him lock the door with the key.\"). The Appeals Chamber notes that Witness CCH testified that she assisted Rukundo by carrying drinks into his room, explaining that she hoped Rukundo would choose to help her. T. 13 February 2007 p. 61; T. 14 February 2007 p. 9 (\"When he said those words, he did not seem to be annoyed. I believed that he just might change his mind and do something for me.\").\n\nProsecutor v. Popović et al., Case No. IT-05-88-T, Judgement (TC), 10 June 2010, para. 1314-1318, 1399:\n\n\"1314. Steeped in knowledge, Beara became a driving force behind the murder enterprise. His vigorous efforts to organise locations and sites, recruit personnel, secure equipment and oversee executions all evidence his grim determination to kill as many as possible as quickly as possible. His encounters with Deronjić on the night of 13 July provide a chilling illustration of a mind set on destruction. He announces an intent to \"kill all\" the detained men, and without pause to consider or comment upon the horrific nature of his \"orders\" he launches into a series of heated exchanges about the best location for this reprehensible undertaking.\n\n1315. Beara’s own words provide further evidence of his intent. He stated on 13 July:\n\n\"Shove them all on the playground, who gives a fuck about them. You mean they are doing it amongst themselves [killing themselves]? Well, excellent. Just let them continue. Fuck it.\"\n\nBeara further stated on 14 July: We have a lot of prisoners and it is very hard for us to control them. They are at various locations in the Zvornik municipality. We have to get rid of them. I expect some assistance from the municipality.\n\n1316. And there are his striking words to Krstić as he implores him for more men to carry out this nefarious crime: \"I don’t know what to do. I mean it Krle. There are still 3500 ‘parcels’ that I have to distribute and I have no solution.\" These words capture clearly and succinctly the state of mind of a man bent on destroying a group by killing all the members of it within his reach.\n\n1317. From his knowledge, his actions and his words, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Beara’s genocidal intent.\n\n1318. The factors which the Trial Chamber finds to be decisive in finding that Beara had the requisite specific intent for genocide are the scale and scope of the killing operation carried out with his knowledge, pursuant to his instructions and under his supervision, his extensive and forceful participation in all components of the killing operation, his demonstrated determination to kill as many as possible and his vital contribution in overcoming hurdles and challenges to effective implementation. Further, the systematic, exclusive targeting of Bosnian Muslims, the repetition by Beara of destructive and discriminatory acts and his words all evidence his genocidal intent. Further, his participation in these killings with knowledge that they would contribute to the destruction of the group also demonstrates his genocidal intent. Accordingly, the Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Beara parti cipated in the JCE to Murder with genocidal intent. He is therefore guilty of genocide.\"\n\n\"1399. As indicated before, while the use of derogatory language may be of relevance in relation to genocidal intent, it does not in and of itself evidence such intent. This is particularly the case given the culture within the VRS and the Zvornik Brigade in which such language was commonplace. Further, the Trial Chamber has considered the proximity of Nikolić’s use of the language to the criminal acts but is not persuaded that this adds weight to the evidence as an indicator of genocidal intent. His words are captured at that time because he served as duty officer during the relevant period and again there is nothing to suggest this was other than a reflection of an unacceptable but common practice.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Ephrem Setako, Case No. ICTR-04-81-T , Judgement (TC), 25 February 2010, para. 472:\n\n\"472. Considering the nature of these events, the Chamber finds that the assailants intentionally killed these two groups of Tutsis. The selection of the victims was not by chance. Setako called for the killing of Tutsis at the camp on 25 April, and among the large number of persons there only members of this group were killed. In addition, the victims of the killings on 11 May were identified as Tutsis before the instruction to kill them was given. The Chamber has also heard extensive evidence of the targeting of Tutsis in Ruhengeri prefecture (II.3.1-.5). In this context, the only reasonable conclusion is that the assailants who perpetrated the killings possessed the intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, the Tutsi group.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Slobodan Milošević, Case No. IT-02-54-T, Decision on Motion for Judgement of Acquittal (TC), 16 June 2004, paras. 240 – 244:\n\n\"240. Mr. Harland testified that on numerous occasions, members of the Bosnian Serb leadership expressed their resolve to achieve the stated objective at all costs, and that Radovan Karadžić, in particular, in his pre-conflict statements forecast the extermination of the Bosnian Muslim population in the event of war. Radovan Karadžić stated, \"We will use this Serbian-supported war machine to make life impossible for civilians\", to terrorise the civilians in order to reach a particular political goal.609\n\n241. The following quotations provide insight into Radovan Karadžić state of mind at the relevant time:\n\n• \"They [Muslims] will disappear, that people will disappear from the face of the Earth . . . . They do not understand that there would be bloodshed and that the Muslim people would be exterminated. The deprived Muslims, who do not know where he is leading, to what he is leading the Muslims, would disappear . . .\".610\n\n• \"In just a couple of days, Sarajevo will be gone and there will be five hundred thousand dead, in one month Muslims will be annihilated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. . .\".611\n\n• \"First, none of their leaders would survive, they’d all be killed in three to four hours. They’d stand no chance of surviving whatsoever\".612\n\n• \"This is the road that you want Bosnia and Herzegovina to take, the same highway of hell and suffering that Slovenia and Croatia went through. Don’t think you won’t take Bosnia and Herzegovina to hell and Muslim people in possible extinction. Because, Muslim people will not be able to defend itself if it comes to war here!\"613\n\n• \"What will we do if we get a state in which we are a minority? . . . They want us and the Croats to remain in a unified Bosnia so that we control the Muslims. We cannot be in that unified state. We well know, where fundamentalism arrives, you cannot live any more. . . . This conflict was incited so that the Muslims would not exist\".614\n\n• \"We certainly know that we must give up something – that is beyond doubt insofar as we want to achieve our first strategic goal: to drive our enemies by the force of war from their homes, that is, the Croats and Muslims, so that we will no longer be together in a state\".615\n\n242. On 1 May 1992, Biljana Plavšić told Mr. Doyle, Lord Carrington’s personal representative, that if there was to be a division of territory, the Serbs deserved more territory, and if it took the lives of three million people to solve the problem, then they should get on with it.616\n\n243. Similarly, Dragan Kalinić, Minister of Health of Republika Srpska, said in May 1992, at the 16th RS Assembly in relation to Sarajevo, \". . . knowing who our enemies are, how perfidious they are, how they cannot be trusted until they are physically, militarily destroyed and crushed, which, of course, implies eliminating and liquidating their key people\".617\n\n244. At the 34th Assembly of Republika Srpska from 27 August to 1 October 1993, Momčilo Krajišnik stated, \"Believe me, it would be the greatest tragedy if the Muslims accepted to live together with us. You’ve seen how they engratiate [sic] themselves with the Croats. . . . [W]e might lose our state. I simply wouldn’t accept that; I would accept a lesser percentage than we have now in order to remain divided, that we have our state and not be with the Muslims\".618\"\n\n\"609.

In Section II.4 above, the Chamber found that a large number of men, women and children, who were predominantly Tutsi, sought refuge in the area of Bisesero from April through June 1994, where there was widespread violence during that period, in the form of attacks targeting this population on an almost daily basis. Witnesses heard attackers singing songs referring to the extermination of the Tutsi. The Chamber concludes that these attacks were carried out with the specific intent to destroy in whole the Tutsi population in Bisesero, for the sole reason of its ethnicity.1160\"\n\n\"1160.

Accordingly, the Chamber notes that on the basis of the evidence presented, it emerges that acts of serious bodily and mental harm, including rape and other forms of sexual violence were often accompanied by humiliating utterances, which clearly indicated that the intention underlying each specific act was to destroy the Tutsi group as a whole. The Chamber notes, for example, that during the rape of Nyiramusugi Musema declared: \"The pride of the Tutsis will end today\". In this context, the acts of rape and sexual violence were an integral part of the plan conceived to destroy the Tutsi group. Such acts targeted Tutsi women, in particular, and specifically contributed to their destruction and therefore that of the Tutsi group as such. Witness N testified before the Chamber that Nyiramusugi, who was left for dead by those who raped her, had indeed been killed in a way. Indeed, the Witness specified that \"what they did to her is worse than death\".\"\n\n[B. Evidentiary comment:]\n\nP.15.2.

Evidence of the perpetrator having ordered or encouraged other to commit genocidal acts.\n\nA. Legal source/authority and evidence:\n\nProsecutor v. Ildephonse Nizeyimana, Case No. ICTR-2000-55, Judgement (TC), 19 June 2012, para. 1496:\n\n1496. The Chamber considers that Nizeyimana’s orders to return the family to the location from which they were first retrieved amounted to significant and substantial contributions to their deaths. In light of Nizeyimana’s awareness that the implementation of these instructions would lead to the killing of this family, the only reasonable conclusion is that he too possessed genocidal intent. The Chamber also finds that Nizeyimana was aware of the genocidal intent held by the principal perpetrators.\n\nProsecutor v. Dominique Ntawukulilyayo, Case No. ICTR-05-82, Judgement (TC), 3 August 2010, para. 454-456:\n\n454. By instructing the mostly Tutsi refugees at Gisagara market to go to Kabuye hill, Ntawukulilyayo substantially contributed to their subsequent killings. His encouraging words to the displaced persons that they would be accommodated for at Kabuye hill facilitated their movement from the populated centre of Gisagara market to the relatively isolated Kabuye hill. This provided a tactical advantage to the attackers, who subsequently surrounded the refugees, and it removed the assault from the public eye. He provided further sanction and material support to the killings that followed at Kabuye hill by bringing soldiers there. Both his status as the highest administrative official in the sub-prefecture and his act of transporting soldiers to Kabuye hill clearly would, at a minimum, have lent encouragement and moral support to the principal perpetrators he transported there, even though his stay was brief.\n\n455. No one expressly heard Ntawukulilyayo give instructions to the soldiers he brought to Kabuye hill. However, his prominent role in removing Tutsis from Gisagara market to Kabuye hill and his direct involvement in transporting assailants to there leads the Majority to the only reasonable conclusion that he ordered the assailants that he brought there to kill the Tutsi refugees. This finding accepts the possibility that similar orders may have been given by other civilian or military authorities. Nonetheless, Ntawukulilyayo’s position of authority, direct involvement and presence at the hill, even if brief, would have compelled the assailants to whom he had issued orders to kill.\n\n456. Given the systemic and extensive nature of the attack, the Majority has no doubt that its purpose was to eliminate the primarily Tutsi refugees gathered on Kabuye hill and that the assailants possessed genocidal intent. Furthermore, the range of assailants, including soldiers and communal police, who participated in the assault just hours after Ntawukulilyayo sent refugees to Kabuye hill evinces considerable coordination. Indeed, Ntawukulilyayo’s arrival on Kabuye hill with soldiers would no doubt have required planning, given that they were not normally stationed within the sub-prefecture. Under the circumstances, there is no doubt that Ntawukulilyayo instructed refugees to go to Kabuye hill and transported soldiers there with the knowledge of the genocidal intent of the assailants and that his acts would assist the killings. The evidence firmly establishes that Ntawukulilyayo shared that genocidal intent.\n\nProsecutor v. Callixte Nzabonimana, Case No. ICTR-98-44D, Judgement (TC), 31 May 2012, para 887:\n\n887. Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Chamber concludes that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that on the afternoon of 14 April 1994, Nzabonimana held a meeting at Cyayi cellule, Kiyumba secteur, Nyabikenke commune, Gitarama préfecture, located approximately 250 to 300 metres from the commune office. Approximately 30 people were present at Cyayi centre, including Witness CNAI, Witness CNAX, Witness T193, Isaac Kamali and a Tutsi named Evariste Munyagatare. At this meeting, Nzabonimana said to those gathered: \"I know that Hutus do not heed instructions. Do not continue to eat the cows of Tutsi who have sought refuge at the communal office. What really matters is not the cows; it is, rather, the owners of the cows that matter.\" Evariste Munyagatare challenged Nzabonimana after he spoke, and Nzabonimana said that their time had not yet come, but that it would come soon.\n\nProsecutor v. Fran?ois Karera, Case No. ICTR-01-74-T, Judgement (TC), 7 December 2007, paras 538-539:\n\n\"538. The Chamber is satisfied that Kabahaye, Murekezi, Ndingutse and Palatin Nyagatare were killed pursuant to Karera’s orders to the policemen and Interahamwe to kill Tutsi and destroy their homes, which were given between 7 and 15 April (II.4.5).\n\n539. Karera’s orders to kill Tutsis demonstrate his genocidal intent. He was aware of the dangerously unstable environment, having evacuated his family from Nyamirambo for safety reasons (II.7), and knew that his order would lead to killings. His order to destroy houses of Tutsis as well as the destruction of the houses of Kahabaye and Felix Dix (II.4.5) also illustrate his intent. The Chamber sees no need to take into account Karera’s anti-Tutsi statement concerning school-children in Zaire in December 1994 (II.8.2).\"\n\nProsecutor v. Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, Case No. ICTR-99-54A-A, Judgement (AC), 19 September 2005, paras. 80 – 81:\n\n\"80. The Appeals Chamber finds that the fact that the Appellant gave the order to attack the refugees at the Gikomero Parish Compound, thus starting a massacre which resulted in the death of a large number of Tutsi refugees, would already as such allow a reasonable trier of fact to find that the Appellant had a genocidal intent.\n\n81. In addition, the Appeals Chamber notes that Witness GEK, who had been found \"highly credible\" by the Trial Chamber,168 testified about the meeting that occurred sometime between 6 and 10 April 1994 at the home of the Appellant’s cousin in Gikomero:\n\n\"168. Trial Judgement, para. 272.\n\n169. Trial Judgement, para. 273. Cf. Trial Judgement, para. 253, quoting T. 3 September 2001 pp. 170, 171.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, Case No. ICTR-2001-71-I, Judgement (TC), 15 July 2004, paras. 458, 462:\n\n\"458. The Chamber has found that on two occasions, on 23 and 24 April 1994, the Accused travelled to Gitwa Hill, which was then the site of a gathering of thousands of Tutsi refugees encircled by an even larger number of primarily civilian attackers. On each of these occasions, the Accused distributed weapons to attackers taking part in the siege. Further, the Accused overtly encouraged, by his words or acts, the initiation of an attack against the Tutsi civilians sheltering on Gitwa Hill. On one occasion he said: ‘Go. There are Tutsi who have become difficult. There are Tutsi on the hill and they’ve proved to be difficult. You, therefore have to kill them, and when you kill them, you will be compensated.\" On a different occasion, the Accused said that the attackers ‘should implement the plan that was envisaged immediately’, meaning thereby that the Tutsi should be killed.\"\n\n\"462. The Accused instigated, and aided and abetted, this genocide at Gitwa Hill. He expressly urged the attackers to kill the \"Tutsi\" assembled there. He distributed machetes and, on at least one occasion, transported armed attackers to the site. He visited Gitwa Hill two occasions, distributing machetes and urging an attack on the Tutsi. By his words and deeds, the Accused manifested an intent that the Tutsi on Gitwa Hill, who numbered in the thousands, should be attacked and killed. Further, the Accused was well aware that his remarks and actions were part of a wider context of ethnic violence, killing and massacres Rwanda during this period.600 The Chamber finds that by urging the killing of the Tutsi Gitwa Hill, the Accused intended to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.\"\n\n\"600. T. 25 November 2004 p. 14 (\"Now, I knew that people were being massacred…\"); T. 28 November 2004 p. 14 (\"Q. Were massacres committed in Rwanda from around the 7th of April to about the middle of July?.... A. The massacres were committed….\").\"\n\nProsecutor v. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Case No. ICTR-2001-64-T, Judgement (TC), 17 June 2004, para. 258 - 259:\n\n\"258. The Chamber recalls that the phrase \"destroy in whole or in part a[n] ethnic group\" does not imply a numeric approach. It is sufficient to prove that the Accused acted with intent to destroy a substantial part of the targeted group.249 In this instance, the scale of the massacres and the fact that Tutsi were targeted, including in the incitement by the Accused, are sufficient proof thereof.\n\n259. In its factual findings, the Chamber extensively considered the actions and utterances of the Accused. Thus, at the meeting of 9 April, the Accused urged the conseillers de secteur to incite the Hutu to kill the Tutsi. Similarly, in the morning of 13 April at the Nyakarambi market, on 14 April at the Rwanteru and Kanyinya trading centres, the Accused made similar utterances to the population, and on 17 April, he instigated the rape of Tutsi women and girls. Moreover, the Accused personally killed Murefu, a Tutsi, thereby signalling the beginning of the attack at Nyarubuye Parish on 15 April 1994.250 The Chamber finds that at the time of the events in Rusumo commune, which events have been established in the factual findings above, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi had the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.\"\n\n\"249. See ILC Report (1996), para. 8.\n\n250. See supra: Chapter II, Parts B and C.\"\n\nProsecutor v. Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, Case No. ICTR-99-54A-T, Judgement (TC), 22 January 2004, paras. 637, 639:\n\n\"637. The Chamber has found that at a meeting occurring sometime between 6 April 1994 and 10 April 1994, at the home of his cousins in Gikomero commune, the Accused addressed those present, incited them to start killing Tutsi, and distributed grenades, machetes and guns to them to use and to further distribute. He also told the participants that he would return to see if they had started the killings, or so that the killings could start.\"\n\n\"639. The Majority of the Chamber has found that the Accused, after a conversing with Pastor Nkuranga, ordered the armed persons whom he brought to the Parish to \"work\" which, in this context, was understood by some witnesses as an order for the killings of the Tutsi refugees to start.
