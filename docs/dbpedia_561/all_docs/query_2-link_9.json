        "text": "FOCUS\n\nIn September 2000, over 80 international NGOs came together to sign a statement against ethnic violence that was published in newspapers and distributed to political, religious and civil leaders throughout Kosovo. In light of recent events, the Minorities Alliance Working Group (MAWG), a consortium of international NGOs working in Kosovo, reissues this statement.\n\nAn International NGO Statement on Ethnic Violence\n\nHarassment, intimidation, hand grenade attacks, burning of houses, drive-by shootings, kidnappings and murders still occur more than one and a half years after the entry of the international community into Kosovo. Acts of ethnically-motivated violence continue unabated, and are worsening in some areas. Significant numbers of people still live in a state of extreme fear. Many inhabitants are being forced to flee their homes because of the present climate of impunity and insecurity. All ethnic groups are affected by this violence, which only serves to further divide the people in Kosovo.\n\nThe international NGOs are working with all ethnic groups in Kosovo. Our work is based on the humanitarian principles of bringing dignity to all, encouraging human rights and working with impartiality. These principles are embodied in international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The assistance we provide is based on need, regardless of race, ethnicity, political affiliation, religion or gender.\n\nWhile we will continue to aim at fostering a climate of respect for human rights and basic dignity in Kosovo, our actions will have a minimal humanitarian impact as long as the fundamental human rights of people are being denied.\n\nThe responsibility for building a peaceful, just and tolerant life ultimately rests with the members of this society. We therefore call upon all people in Kosovo not only to condemn any act of violence and intimidation, but also to create a Kosovo where everyone can live in peace with dignity.\n\nThe Minorities Alliance Working Group (MAWG)\n\nFollowing is a press statement issued by UNHCR on 20th February\n\nUNHCR is outraged by the numerous attacks committed in Kosovo over the last week. The meticulous planning of these attacks clearly indicates a pattern intended to destabilise any process towards peace in Kosovo.\n\n\"The Serbs and other minorities are being hunted down one by one and extreme members of the society will not rest until Kosovo is ethnically cleansed,\" said UNHCR's Special Envoy Eric Morris. \"These incidents committed by a few extremists will lead to the erosion of the support of the international community for Kosovo and will ultimately affect everyone,\" he added.\n\nThe Special Envoy also expressed concern about the culture of impunity and the wall of silence in Kosovo that together allow extremist elements to continue the violence.\n\nUNHCR stands by the principle of the right of return for all communities in the region, irrespective of race, religion, ethnicity or nationality. During the summer of 1999, over 850,000 ethnic Albanians returned to their homes with the support of UNHCR. Going on two years since the international community entered Kosovo however, there still seems to be little hope for the minorities to live in peace and for those displaced to return to their homes.\n\nWith the increase of attacks on minorities over the past month, UNHCR's Special Envoy expresses great concern for the future of Kosovo, which day by day is losing the sympathy of the international community. \"It is unfortunate that innocent civilians from all ethnic backgrounds, including Albanian, will once again become the victims of the extremists,\" he said.\n\nUNHCR Kosovo\n\nFor additional information, please contact: Astrid van Genderen Stort, Public Information Officer, Tel: 381.38.501.509 or Vangende@unhcr.ch\n\n1. SECURITY\n\n1.1 KOSOVO\n\nOn Friday 16th February at 11:15 a.m, an explosion occurred on the main road by the village of Livadice / Livadica, near Podujeve / Podujevo. At the time of the explosion, the KFOR-escorted Serb convoy known as the Nis Express was returning to Kosovo from Serbia proper.. The convoy consisted of seven civilian buses and seven KFOR military vehicles. The first bus in the convoy was destroyed by the explosion. The remaining six buses returned to Serbia. Seven Kosovo Serbs travelling in the first bus were killed in the explosion (the death toll is now 10), and 43 other passengers were injured. No KFOR soldiers were injured. The injured were helicoptered to the KFOR British field hospital in Prishtina / Pristina and KFOR US field hospital at Camp Bondsteel. Initial reports indicate the explosion was caused by a bomb placed in a culvert and detonated by a command wire. The bomb is believed to have contained at least 100 kilograms of explosive. The investigation continues.\n\nContact: Kjell Lauvik on Lauvik@unhcr.ch\n\n1.2 PRESEVO\n\nKosovo and Southern Serbia's Presevo Valley are experiencing the worst violence in a year and a half. Most -- though not all -- of the violence has been directed at Serbs.\n\nOn Sunday 18th February in Presevo Valley, a Serbian police vehicle struck two mines buried the previous night on a dirt road outside the village of Lucane in Presevo Valley. All three policemen in the vehicle were killed. The author of a Belgrade-approved peace plan, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic believes the attack was an attempt to wreck the plan for integrating Albanians into the mainstream in southern Serbia, while demilitarising the area.\n\nHours after the deaths of the three Serb policemen an ethnic Albanian UCPMB commander was shot dead by Serbian police in Lucane. Two other UCPMB members were wounded when they went to retrieve his body - just 50 metres from a Serbian special police position. Heavy fighting continues, especially in the Lucane area.\n\nContact: Kjell Lauvik on LAUVIK@unhcr.ch\n\n1.3 MACEDONIA\n\nThere was further tension on Macedonia's northern border with Kosovo on 16th February following an exchange of gunfire between a Kosovo Albanian armed group on the Kosovo side and a Macedonian Army patrol in Macedonia. The Macedonians reported no casualties but claimed to have shot two armed Albanians during the exchange.\n\nThe incident took place in the remote rural area near the Kodra Fura mountain - Debelde village region, 15 km north east of the main Blace border crossing point and 15 km south of the Kosovo village of Vitina. This section of the border was the scene of several incidents during the summer of 2000 in which a number of Macedonian Army soldiers were injured by mines.\n\nIt was also reported that earlier in the day (16 Feb) a Macedonian television crew filming in the same area was held by armed Kosovo Albanians for several hours - the exact details are unclear. During the afternoon, three of the four were released unharmed. It is not known if the fourth is still being held.\n\nThe Macedonian Police and Army have reinforced their guard posts and patrols between Blace and Kumanovo in anticipation of further incidents.\n\nInformation received suggests there were over 100 armed Kosovo Albanians in the area and that they identified themselves to the tv crew as the National Army of Liberation of Albanians in Macedonia (AKSH).\n\nOn 19th February, up to 150 armed persons in black uniforms were observed concentrating close to the border. Macedonian Border Brigade requested assistance from KFOR and UNMIK Police and its units were put on a higher alert stage. The situation remains tense and 60 families are reported to have moved from the Macedonian side of the border to Vitina in Kosovo.\n\nContact: Kjell Lauvik on Lauvik@unhcr.ch\n\n2. MINORITIES\n\nWithin three days two routine and KFOR-escorted Serb convoys were attacked in Kosovo. The first in Strpce on 13th February, saw one person killed and two injured, the second, near Podujevo on 16th February 11 dead and 43 injured. The force of the Podujevo explosion was such that some bodies still have not been found. The attack outside Podujevo was against a convoy carrying approximately 50 Serb families who had left Kosovo fearing attacks but who were returning to visit the graves of relatives on 17th February, the Orthodox Day of the Dead. The attacks have been condemned by Albanian political party leaders and by UCPMB leader, Shefquet Musliu.\n\nThese attacks are part of the continuing violence against minorities in general in Kosovo. The aim appears to be to 'discourage' returns and force those remaining minorities to leave. Some of the attacks in February include:\n\nin Suhareke/Suva Reka a grenade was thrown at a Roma family house. No injuries were reported but the family had to leave the house for security reasons.\n\nalso in Suhareke/Suva Reka, a Roma man was found dead two days after leaving the TCS to return to his village with his three children.\n\nthree bullets hit the house of one of the last remaining Roma families in Stimlje.\n\na bazooka was fired at an Ashkalija house in Medvece village. No one was hurt.\n\nan Ashkalija - a Kosovar refugee in Bosnia, who had returned to look for his wife - was found shot dead near Stimlje.\n\nshots were fired at two Serb houses in Stimlje town. One houseowner, an elderly widow, had her grandchildren and daughter-in-law visiting her when the incidents happened. Fortunately no one was injured.\n\na Serb house in Lipjan town was hit by an explosion. No injuries were sustained..\n\nthree Serbs were injured by a mine (suspected by KFOR to be newly laid) while collecting firewood in Sekiraca (Podujevo Municipality).\n\na Lada belonging to the Bresje (Fush Kosova/Kosovo Polje) health house was shot at 3 times in one week.\n\nThe pressure on minority Serb communities to sell their properties is increasing and more and more Kosovar Serbs residing in the isolated enclaves are leaving Kosovo. On February 13, in a meeting in Rahovec/Orahovac with KFOR, OSCE, UNHCR and UNMIK, the Serb leaders announced that 90% of the residents in the area wanted to leave for Serbia proper due to lack of security. KFOR made a commitment to try to improve security conditions. It was agreed that a meeting should be held fortnightly to discuss security issues.\n\nAccording to local KFOR 40 Serb families in Gjilan/Gnilane are selling their properties; only about 250 Serbs still live in Gjilan/Gnilane. In Obilic town there is a strong pressure for the remaining Serb families living in a building in the centre of the town to sell their apartments following the illegal occupation of empty flats by 18 ethnic Albanian families. On 14 February, the last Serb in Podujevo town, an elderly lady, sold her property and left for Serbia proper as she could no longer cope in such isolated conditions.\n\nThe reaction of the minority communities, particularly the Serbs, to this violence and intimidation has been demonstrations, many of which, such as the 6,500 people who gathered to hear Bishop Anastasia speak in Gracanica on 17th, and the 1,500 people addressed by various K-Serb leaders in Mitrovica, have been peaceful.\n\nHowever, an Albanian-owned restaurant and two cars were burned, and eight Albanians suffered minor injuries during a Serb demonstration south of Pristina on Friday, 16th . On Saturday, 17th February, during peaceful demonstration outside the police station in Zubin Potok, a group of around 40 Serb youths attacked the police station with rocks and petrol bombs. The police station was again attacked the following day. On the same day, Sunday 18th February, Serb and Albanian demonstrators threw stones at each other in Fushe Kosova/Kosovo Polje.\n\nThese demonstrations are continuing. And, apart from the disruption to work and every day life, their potential for escalating violence is great.\n\nContact: Jeanne Boisclair on Boisclai@unhcr.ch\n\n3. GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n3.1 SRSG Hans Haekkerup has condemned the 16th February bombing of the Serb convoy near Podujevo as a 'cowardly act of terrorism'. He went on to describe the attack as a terrible tragedy not only for the victims and their families but for all people of Kosovo, adding that 'those who believe such a contemptible act might in some way advance the political aims of a small, extremist and marginalised sector of Kosovo's society are seriously mistaken.'\n\nContact: UNMIK Press & Information Office on 500 223 ext. 5719\n\n3.2 The WHO team of experts in Kosovo in response to a request from then SRSG, Dr Bernard Kouchner to assess possible health risks from depleted uranium (DU) was unable to find any basis for a reported increase in cases of leukaemia.\n\nThe main findings of the preliminary report submitted to UNMIK - the final version is expected to be released shortly by WHO in Geneva - are:\n\nDU is only weakly radioactive and emits around 40% less radioactivity than a similar mass of natural uranium\n\nthere is no scientifically or medically proven link between exposure to DU and cancers, congenital abnormalities or serious toxic chemical effects on organs (Some scientists would like a larger body of independent, ie non military, funded studies to confirm this\n\nNo firm medical evidence was found by the team to link individual medical cases in Kosovo to exposure to DU\n\nThe most likely way civilians could come into contact with DU is through picking up ordnance or parts of ordnance from the ground.\n\nThe likelihood of DU entering agricultural products is not known but can \"reasonably\" be expected to be small given that that most of the DU is in a solid, very slowly degrading metallic form\n\nAmong the team's recommendations are:\n\nUseful and realistic information on DU should be prepared and distributed to the general public\n\nMass screening of the public for DU is not thought necessary\n\nClean-up of surface DU sites should, wherever possible, be part of planned, routine demining activities\n\nFacilities should be made available to include the measurement of uranium in routine drinking water quality tests by the Institute of Public Health\n\nIt is also recommended that potential developers looking at sites on or near former attack zones should be made aware of the possibility of buried munitions and given clear instructions on how to proceed.\n\nThe team's full list of conclusions and recommendations can be found in WHO's Kosovo Health Talks No. 39.\n\nContact: Edward Poultney on poultney@excite.com.\n\n3.3 With the granting of a licence to the New Bank of Kosovo on 9th February 2001 people in the province will soon have an alternative to the Micro-Enterprise Bank (MEB). Services to be offered by the new bank include receiving deposits, extending credit, providing payment and collection services, foreign exchange and providing guarantees and letters of credit.\n\nInitially, New Bank of Kosovo plans to operate from Pristina and open additional branches at a later date.\n\nMore banks are needed to further improve banking services in Kosovo and to help in the expansion of the economy. Six other banks have been issued preliminary licence approval by the Banking Practices Authority of Kosovo (BPK), but none of them has yet met the requirements for a final licence.\n\nContact: Mike Todd on mikeinpristina@hotmail.com\n\n3.4 Kosovo is in transition: from humanitarian assistance to development, from the humanitarian agencies to UNMIK and from UNMIK to local administrations and other local agencies and bodies. Much planning and preparation, including capacity building and training, is required if well trained and well equipped institutions and individuals are to be in place to carry on the work as the internationals withdraw.\n\nTo ensure that any gaps in this process are identified and measures taken to fill them, the Humanitarian Co-ordinator, Mr Eric Morris, has requested that the transition process be reviewed and its progress closely monitored. The review, which is being carried out in close co-operation with the UN Development Group, has already begun and will continue over the next few weeks.\n\nTo start the process OCHA has taken as its base a paper titled 'Update on Transition Initiatives' produced in April 2000 by UNMIK that outlines the progress of the transition as it then stood. OCHA has made a preliminary assessment of the evolution of the situation since then and is following it up with consultations with individual agencies, with NGOs through sectoral meetings and with UNMIK. A document on the transition that will analyse the elements crucial to a successful transition, as well as highlighting potential and actual gaps and making suggestions for filling them, will be prepared by OCHA and released in April - one year after the UNMIK paper.\n\nTo reflect the transition and other changes taking place in Kosovo, the Humanitarian Update is also changing. It already includes more information from UNMIK of relevance to the humanitarian community and will endeavour to bring in other sources of items of interest such as KFOR, Civpol and local NGOs. However, we also need the views of the humanitarian community on how the Update can be improved in line with the changing situation, and how best it can serve the needs of its readership. As a first step we are asking you to complete the short questionnaire at the end of this issue and return it, either electronically or in hard copy, to the addresses given by 28th February. We very much hope we can count on your co-operation in this matter.\n\nContact: Jeanne Boisclair on BOISCLAI@unhcr.ch\n\n4. RECONSTRUCTION\n\n4.1 Kosovo is in a transitional period, moving from humanitarian assistance to development. While continued attention is and must be devoted to on-going humanitarian concerns, the international community in the province is increasingly looking towards addressing longer-term development issues.\n\nAs part of this, and under the auspices of the UN Development Co-ordinator in Kosovo, and in co-operation with the Humanitarian Co-ordinator's office, the UN agencies in Kosovo have been engaged in producing the Kosovo Common Assessment (KCA), which is now almost complete.\n\nThe KCA is Kosovo's equivalent of a Country Common Assessment. It highlights key areas of development to be addressed collectively by agencies, and is the precursor to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), the UN system's three-year business plan. Formulation of the KCA has been conducted in close association with the Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) in order to ensure harmony between the aims and objectives of the CAP 2001 and UN agencies' aspirations for the longer term.\n\nThe KCA highlights key development objectives across many sectors, including Housing, Education, Agriculture, Health and Social Welfare, Economic Development and Capacity Building, the Environment and Gender. It will be available in March.\n\nContact: Asif Husain-Naviatti on asifhn@bigfoot.com\n\n4.2 On Thursday 8th March, the first UNMIK-KFOR-NGO Small-Medium Business Seminar for Women will take place in Pristina. This is one of a series of seminars, as reported in Update No 33, organised by UNMIK and KFOR to bring together NGOs working in business training and/or credit and potential business people.\n\nThe seminar will take place at 2.00 pm on Thursday, 8th March in the City Hall auditorium, opposite the Government Building, in Pristina.\n\nContact: Captain Varick Ready on cell phone +49-160-531-4515 or on Varick.ready@bondsteel12.areur.army.mil\n\n4.3 IOM is carrying out Kosovo-wide Career Development and Business Plan Training as part of its Employment Assistance Centres (EAC) Project. Its main objective is to support all individual efforts to strengthen the labour market, improve the economic prospects of the province and bring stability to its people.\n\nContact: Tamara Osorio on TOsorio@iom.ipko.org\n\n4.4 Producing a Resource Directory of all agencies active in Kosovo is the Humanitarian Community Information Centre's major current project. The Directory will be searchable by activity sector and location of intervention and will be a 'who does what where' database to assist in planning co-ordinated, sustainable development work.\n\nTo ensure the data is compatible with other organisations, HCIC is promoting the use of P-code geographical locators and activity sector codes that are standard throughout the UN system. The Directory will make use of the latest graphical interface software to ensure it is user-friendly and will be accessed through the HCIC website. It will be made available to UN and UNMIK planners, donors and local organisations. The database will also have the capacity to incorporate agency details from other sources, for example, the Department of Reconstruction, OSCE, UNDP, etc.\n\nA presentation on the Directory to information specialists will be held on Thursday 29th March and a separate presentation for NGOs will be arranged if required. The questionnaire to gather the relevant information will be distributed in March.\n\nContact: Mick Quinn on hcicmanager@hotmail.com\n\n5. SECTORAL ACTIVITIES\n\n5.1 FOOD\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) continues to co-operate with UNMIK's Department of Health and Social Welfare (DHSW) in the transition from a food-based to a cash-based social assistance scheme. In this connection, WFP has reduced the number of Category II beneficiaries (those willing and able to work, but unable to find employment and lacking resources to meet basic needs) by 17,720 for its February distribution. This brings to 172,000 the number of rations distributed during the month.\n\nIn addition, WFP is working with its implementing partners on a safety net programme, aimed at assisting those beneficiaries who, for one reason or another, may not be covered by the Centre for Social Welfare (CSW) scheme. The programme also comprises a major capacity-building component whose ultimate goal is to allow WFP to hand-over the safety net to its local distribution partners, i.e. the local community.\n\nThe WFP/FAO Food Security Surveillance Unit (FSSU) is co-ordinating a food economy assessment that will define the ceiling and the criteria for the safety net programme. The first results of the assessment are expected by mid-March.\n\nContact: Liliana D'Aniello on liliana.daniello@wfp.org\n\n5.2 EDUCATION\n\n5.2.1 Thirty-two brand new vehicles recently arrived at the UNICEF logistics base in Pristina to be donated to the Department of Education and Science for use by its municipal advisors. As functional authority over education shifts towards the municipal level, these advisors have an increased need for reliable transportation to carry out their job. The donation to UNICEF of these vehicles was made possible by support from the Government of Japan, through the United Nations Human Security Fund.\n\nContact: Patrick Fruchet on pfruchet@unicef.org\n\n5.3 HEALTH\n\n5.3.1 The approaching 'Kosovarisation' of the Department of Health and Social Welfare will be the first test of the joint administrative structures, according to DHSW co-head, Pleurat Sejdu and the ultimate success of the transfer in the health care sector will encourage other departments to follow suit.\n\n'Maybe it will be a green light to the international community to let us take our destiny into our own hands,' he added. However, he pointed out that localisation did not mean that internationals would withdraw, even if they wanted to. He also cautioned his audience of senior health managers to be patient and not expect sudden success, 'It may be that everything you are working on today will be harvested by others.'\n\nContact: Edward Poultney on poultney@excite.com.\n\n5.3.2 Primary health care (PHC) is to be handed over from DHSW to the municipalities on 1st March. However, as municipalities have many other responsibilities and may not have enough people with knowledge of the health sector, regional, or district, health authorities, while losing their managerial function, will remain in an advisory and supporting role to the municipalities till the end of 2001.\n\nContact: Edward Poultney on poultney@excite.com\n\n5.3.4 A mixed group of 22 K-Albanian and K-Serb paramedics have been trained by British KFOR to run Pristina region's emergency ambulance service. The paramedics received an advanced driving course from specialist Royal Marine drivers and were trained to use and maintain the necessary medical equipment. Jean Guinard, regional administrator for Pristina region said that the fact that Serbs and Albanians trained together was a good sign for the future of Kosovo.\n\nContact: Edward Poultney on poultney@excite.com\n\n5.3.5 A group of 20 Kosovar returnees from Finland have passed a two-month Health Care Basic Nursing Course in Pristina. Organised by IOM, the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Péc in Hungary, the \"Dr. Ali Sokoli\" Secondary School of Medicine and University of Pristina, this training course is a component of a larger European Union co-funded project, entitled \"Comprehensive Support Programme for the Return and Reintegration of Kosovo Albanians from Finland\".\n\nContact: Tamara Osorio on TOsorio@iom.ipko.org\n\n5.4 Gender\n\n5.4.1 Women: Bridges of Peace in the Rebuilding of Society was the title of a meeting organised by the Gender Task Force held at the Grand Hotel, Pristina on Tuesday 20th February.\n\nThe meeting focused on the importance of including women in the peace process - something from which they are normally excluded - and the lessons to be learned for Kosovo and other post-conflict regions from Bosnia and the lack of a gender perspective in the Dayton Accords.\n\nParallels were drawn between Bosnia and Kosovo, particularly with regard to the consequences of excluding a gender perspective when drawing up legislation, for example, employment legislation and economic policies. The net result in Bosnia was the impoverishment of women and the growth of the sex industry, including trafficking of women. Unless women are involved in drawing up such legislation and policies, the same is likely to happen in Kosovo, where women are already excluded from new economic opportunities and both trafficking and prostitution are on the increase.\n\nDisregard for gender issues was obvious at the meeting as, although many men from UNMIK, UN agencies, OSCE and other international organisations were invited, only four participated.\n\nAcall was made for more consultation with and respect for local women's organisations from UNMIK, OSCE, UN agencies and international NGOs.\n\nThe Kvinna Till Kvinna report on Dayton - Engendering the Peace Process: A Gender Approach to Dayton - and Beyond - was launched at the meeting.\n\nThe Gender Task Force is made up of a number of international and local women's organisations, including the Women's Network, Women's Coalition, Kvinna Till Kvinna, STAR Network of World Learning, Office of Gender Affairs/UNMIK, UNIFEM.\n\nFor information on the Gender Task Force and Tuesday's meeting contact: Flora Macula on f_macula@yahoo.com\n\nEngendering the Peace Process by Kvinna Till Kvinna can be accessed via www.iktk.se. For further information contact Maria Tropp on maria_tropp@hotmail.com\n\n5.4.2 The IOM Return and Reintegration project continues to support victims of trafficking. Assistance includes pre-departure counselling and transportation to their home countries, as well as reception, reintegration and monitoring in these countries. All activities are co-ordinated with the UNMIK Police, OSCE and other organisations involved in anti-trafficking.\n\nThe current situation in Kosovo is thoroughly exploited by migrant traffickers and organised groups who recruit young women and girls in Moldova, Ukraine, Russia, Bulgaria and Romania. Victims are subjected to forced prostitution and various other forms of abuse, including, physical and psychological coercion and removal of personal documents and passports.\n\nContact: Tamara Osorio on TOsorio@iom.ipko.org\n\n5.5 SOCIAL SERVICES AND COMMUNITY INITIATIVES\n\n5.5.1. Local organisations, Hajde, Post Pessimists and Urban FM in association with IOM have launched an awareness campaign to inform young people on the effects and consequences of using drugs. This unique campaign was devised and organised by young people in Kosovo, Urban FM, Hajde and Post Pessimists, to give direct and simple information to the province's youth on how they can make informed choices about their own lives.\n\nContact: Tamara Osorio on TOsorio@iom.ipko.org\n\nFor comments and further information, please contact:"
