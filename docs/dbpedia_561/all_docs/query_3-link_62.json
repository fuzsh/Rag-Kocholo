        "text": "WARS GET WORSE\n\nThese are pictures of the same wars from different angles. The Bosniaks, the Croats, the Kosovo Albanians and the Serbs, all they had their own view on the war.\n\nVery similar but different.\n\nThe introduction to the exhibition as it was written by me at Tom Blau Gallery in London 2000:\n\nWe live at a time when most of the people of Europe have no first-hand experience of war. When the Balkans exploded into violence we were confronted with war as something new. Organised hostility is difficult to comprehend. While the events associated with wars are complex in respect to their background they are simple in terms of their violence. In a state of war, society fights against the morals it has itself produced. We should, then, be able to oppose war and simultaneously accept its aggressive nature. The seeds of war are hidden in peace. We are taught that the presence of armies is quite natural. Every state seeks to maintain its military power. It is the state’s way of making itself heard on the international stage. While ideologies are spiritual by nature, setbacks turn them into corpses.\n\nAs the millennium was drawing to a close the European idyll was shattered when the federal state of Yugoslavia erupted into violence. The structure of the Iron Curtain had not been fully understood. The former “partisan state” had been divided into spheres of interest which initially aimed to increase their power vis-à-vis the central government. Negotiations between them were unsuccessful and a group of states, all declaring independence in a manner of their own, began to define their mutual relations by means of force. Slovenia succeeded in detaching itself from Yugoslavia with relative ease. The dispute between Croatia and Serbia degenerated into a fully blown war over rights to areas which had been settled by both ethnic groups. In Bosnia-Herzegovina a similar division was taking place involving Muslims, Croatians and Serbs. In Kosovo, the Albanian and Serbian population had nothing more in common than a shared geographical location. Politically the situation erupted into a theatre of war the last act of which, for the time being at least, was a bombing campaign by an American controlled Nato against the mother state, Yugoslavia, the purpose of which was to put to an end the violence that had been going on for too long.\n\nThe Balkan tragedy of the final decade could have been avoided. The decisions were made by people. Bad political judgements were made both in the Balkans and in places with influence in the region. The wall between what happened and what did not is thin. One tragedy followed another and snowballed as if no intervention were possible. Ethnic differences gained importance initially as a means to gain or maintain power, but subsequently their significance changed in such a way as to define the entire picture of the conflict.\n\nMany see the problems of a shattered Yugoslavia as local issues. The Balkans are a reflection of their past. They have brought upon themselves the myth according to which every second generation must have its war. The violence seems distant until it is close at hand as it did in Sarajevo as long as the war was raging in Croatia. Later the war came to Sarajevo too, as it did to so many of the regions in the collapsing federal state.\n\nMany years of war have brought unspeakable misery to the Balkans: a quarter of a million dead, a countless number of wounded, industry and infrastructure destroyed and a population driven into exile. Impoverished economies and the unbridled corruption which govern them build visions of the future that are just as bleak as those economies which define them.\n\nNo nation is a singularity even if, by way of generalisation, it achieves a certain reputation. Every nation encompasses a whole spectrum of values. But wars affect international relations nevertheless. Over the past ten years, the Serbs have gained the same kind of reputation for aggression as did the Germans during the second World War. A stigma which will only slowly fade.\n\nA society wounded by war does not easily rid itself of the blemish of war. I have examined all sides involved in the conflicts in the area previously known as Yugoslavia from the Croatia of 1992 until the Kosovo and Serbia of the present day. My subjects have been those injured both during the period of war and the time that followed.\n\nMy view is simple. I have depicted the seriously wounded on all sides of the conflict, one of the inevitable results of war in which everyone is a loser; in these wars Serbs, Croatians, Bosnian Muslims and Kosova Albanians alike. The purpose of these pictures is to break through the thin shell which the words hide. Rather than seeking reasons I am trying to reveal the consequences of war. My pictures only give a slight indication of the horror story behind the politics of violence in the Balkans, the sum total of which is impossible to define. While attempts are made to translate the destruction wreaked on society into the language of economics, the suffering of the individual cannot be measured. These wounds were inflicted deliberately. They did not come about by accident but were premeditated.\n\nWe have become accustomed to commemorating history and its gravestones, at the same time forgetting the silent moments surrounding the stones. History has traditionally been the story of social revolution and violence. War and peace, each giving birth to the other, each following the other, each in turn making room for change, a change which could lead in either direction.\n\nThe end of the millennium does not mean the inevitable end of anything. Peace is not a permanent state even though it is championed as an aim when people speak. Only that history that has already been made is unchangeable. If good is passive and powerless, evil is the victor.\n\nPerpetuity exists now. It is the only moment we can affect.\n\nJukka Male in London, 1st of April 2000.\n\nI had an article in the Upnorth magazine with these pictures in the year 2015. I wrote about the violence which had started its war signs in Ukraine as well:\n\nEurope has changed and that change has confused us. Life was supposed to be a sweet dream, but that dream is turning into a nightmare. As with all dreams, we don’t know how this one will end before we wake up; if we can know it even then.\n\n“Francis Fukuyama predicted already in 1994 that the only serious threat to the security of Europe could emerge in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine” writes Jermu Laine in the Finnish ‘Tieteessä tapahtuu’-magazine (5/2014).\n\nAfter World War II, Europe lived through an exceptionally long period of peace. That kind of good luck blinded the eyes of many. And by the end of the millennium, Yugoslavia broke down into several wars.\n\nThe photos in this collection portray one of the many results of those conflicts: the wounded.\n\nI photographed all of the ethnic groups that had fought against each other as separate groups. Each one of them, including the Serbs, experienced victimhood, and fear of the others. That was what they said, and that is what people always say. Today, it’s being said in Europe again.\n\nHistory hides in itself the possibility of what never happened, meaning whatever could have happened alternatively, but never did happen anyway.\n\nSlobodan Milosević could be a celebrated leader, dead or alive, if he had succeeded to stop the disintegration of Yugoslavia. That is, if the victims of the violence then, would have been limited to tens or hundreds, if not thousands. We can see it in Eastern Ukraine now: no leader, nor leadership style has been seriously questioned. If the war ended now, the leaders could still go on as leaders on both sides of the borders. Meaning there is a licence to kill.\n\nNationalism is a sense of superiority. Believe it: perhaps you don’t notice it, but with nationalism, the status of some people is quietly elevated, compared to some other people, and placed above others. In some cases, perhaps only above some certain characteristics of someone. Or just one’s potential “betterness” is emphasized. We will change one day. And then we’ll change the others. Or at least we’ll conquer them.\n\nWe do not know how the conflict between Ukraine and Russia will turn out. Even Russia does not know, despite the fact that Russia is known to be most obviously in charge of the violence on the frontlines, even if it won’t admit it. The black swan flies invisible in the dark. The logic, or the senselessness, of the events will only be revealed afterwards. We can get surprised by the speed of those processes, unless we get bored by their slowness. But that, too, will only be revealed later. If things go really bad, the conflict may turn out bigger than the Yugoslav wars ever were.\n\nNo war ends when the actual battles end. Individual victims are hidden in societies recovering from war. Many will live with painful reminders of war each and every day of their lives. The economies of the destroyed countries might recover sooner but not for everybody.\n\nThe speed of information transmission over the internet is unprecedented. But not everything gets faster in the digital age: we have seen this in the slower-than-before return of the investments after the economic depression. The internet is effective in transferring fear, and even more effective in preserving fear. It can bring you to a standstill.\n\nWhile Russia has been labeled a mausoleum of old-fashioned thought, it has progressed much further than the West in the world of communications. It has been easy to disturb publicity and offer many false focuses to understanding. Russia uses distorted methods, and its audacity pays off.\n\nYou grow familiar with whatever you are accustomed to. Crimea is already age-old Russia. It was returned to Mother Russia already age-old months ago. In our fast information space the short term quickly becomes longer than the time between now and the last World War.\n\nAnd also, if we fear that Russia will grab half of Europe, that reduces the significance of the annexation of Crimea, and of course of Eastern Ukraine. History’s course, and the sense of time that follows from it, and the scale, is changed by invoking fear.\n\nGive a little, and you’ll get a lot. The Crimean peninsula has already turned into a little part of a horror scenario. It has been minimized into a necessary and nearly inevitable loss. And as a loss, it already represents, for many, the desired end result of the entire conflict. This is what Russia has pursued the whole time. Russian military exercises, the deployment of troops near Europe’s strategically sensitive spots, as well as the intensive aircraft activity, sometimes far away from its own borders, have all added to the pressure.\n\nAt the moment, I am in Katowice, Poland. The nuclear warheads are also directed at Poland. Theoretically Katowice is out of the reach of the Iskanders (short range missles) anyway. I’d hear their blows from the TV, or Twitter, or Facebook. To begin with, I can’t know the end result. War always evolves.\n\nNo one knows when “your war” will break out. It may happen tomorrow, or never. You just don’t know. Every conflict that becomes a war could have been avoided. How? This cannot be told in a single story. Wars give birth to thousands of stories, only some of which are really true.\n\nI am returning to this project with the goal of studying the long term effects of war. The final material will be published as a book if not as a film as well. At the moment I am looking for some help to finance the project. All good advice is welcome.\n\nLook at the pictures of the wars of Yugoslavia breaking apart, they happened fifteen and twenty years ago. They could soon be pictures of our New Europe.\n\nBesides to the victims I made some pictures from the war zones. Here you see some of them perharps not in the best chronological order.\n\nEXTRACTS FROM THE DIARIES DURING THE WARS ON THE BALKANS:\n\nIn every war there is the first victim to die\n\nand at its end also the last one to be killed.\n\nNo one knows if it was better to be killed\n\nas the first or the last one.\n\nTo die means an end to an individual’s world\n\nbut there is life during the war as well.\n\n*\n\nZagreb, Croatia. July 1992\n\nLili Marlene is playing on the café terrace. First in\n\nGerman, then in Croatian. Then a dull hit, ‘Peace,\n\nYugoslavia, peace’. It must be an old piece. Sulc\n\nwants some other music and at the same time asks\n\nfor the volume to be turned up. He is a discontented\n\nmercenary. ‘How can you get a woman on a hundred\n\nmarks a month? Nohow!’\n\nThe Killer points at a pigeon. ‘Bang!’ His arms leave\n\nstripes in the air and the pigeon would be history if\n\nSulc had a gun. He says he is buying a new pistol,\n\nand then that he killed children in Vukovar. ‘Look at\n\nthat! Sex bomb! Oooh, fucky!’ Sulc gestures at a\n\nwoman. Another woman goes by and gets a thumbsdown.\n\n‘No good!’\n\nSulc has a woman in Sisak. I wonder what she’s\n\nlike. Who could love a troll? He has an animal’s\n\nreflexes. Whenever something rustles, Sulc starts\n\nand is ready for battle. No sleep for the past four\n\ndays. ‘Doesn’t matter! Oh… look, that’s a Chechnik,\n\nthey’ve got beards!’ Sulc is from Kosovo, and bitter\n\ntoward the Serbs. More than for the Croats, he’s\n\nfighting against the Serbs. He won’t tell me his real\n\nname.\n\nIt’s eight in the morning. I go back to the hotel. The\n\ncity fills up with people going to work. I wonder\n\nhow the children felt in the hands of the Killer. Or in\n\nthe hands of the Killers. The circular letter of\n\nmurder has crossed borders and demands a terrible\n\nrevenge which is difficult for us to grasp, but more\n\nhuman than we want to understand. Deep into war,\n\neverything happens. Can the causes of war be\n\nerased just by killing everyone.\n\nI lie down in my hotel room covered only by a sheet.\n\nI imagine I am a corpse. Hatred. War. Rage.\n\nRevenge. Compensation. The three coffees I have\n\nbeen bought burn my stomach. The air-conditioning\n\nhums more evenly now, and doesn’t sound like\n\nbombing any more. A morgue must be kept cool. Do\n\nnot disturb. Do not change the bedclothes until\n\ntomorrow, room 221.\n\nZagreb, Croatia. July 1992\n\nSaturday night, and I am walking in the centre of\n\ntown, amazed at what I see. Is this country at war?\n\nIt doesn’t look like it. It is like falling out of the\n\nblack-and-white film of one’s prejudices into a\n\ncolour film. Murderous battles on the front nearby\n\nand the passionate night-life of the city do not fit\n\nwith my preformed image of war.\n\nThe terrace cafés are full; happy people wander the\n\nstreets. The pavements are opera, dance, ballet and\n\nstory-telling. The front is far away from here. The\n\ncelebrations are a war against war. What seems\n\ncontraversial to the visitor is perhaps a\n\ncompensation for anxiety. But isn’t this going too\n\nfar? No. This city life, which seems extremely\n\nparadoxical to the outside, must be accepted and\n\ndefended. Yes, exactly: defended. Because this is\n\nwhat they want.\n\nSisak, Croatia. July 1992\n\nThere is shooting from Petrinja every day. You can’t\n\nfeel fear for someone else. The fear is always your\n\nown. Incomprehensibility doesn’t make death nonexistent.\n\nDeath manifests itself as absurd, strange,\n\nsomething that happens to other people. The details\n\nof torture do not open up to us. Whether a million\n\nYugoslavs, Serbs, Croats, Bosnians or Albanians die\n\nis a matter of indifference to us. Death, too, must\n\nbe our own. You can’t die for someone else. For\n\nthose who are leaving, it is routine.\n\nZagreb, Croatia. July 1992\n\nHow can war have rules? How can people feel\n\ninsulted because war does not follow its rules. How\n\ncan it be allowed rules. Is it possible for the rules\n\nof war to contain something which is right? Why\n\ndoes no one feel insulted because it is possible for\n\nwar to be intellectually organised activity, because\n\nit is in practice accepted, although in theory it is not\n\nwanted.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a desire to escape even\n\nthe weak rules of war. If it is possible to call war\n\nanti-terrorist activity, then let’s do so. Then there\n\nare no rules to govern cruelty that is committed in\n\nthe name of societal self-defence. How many\n\nvictims are needed before it can be called a war.\n\nThe yardstick of understanding turns grey; hatred\n\nturns into a way of seeing another person.\n\nIn wars, someone is always the last to die. Could\n\nnot even one be spared? Where is the line between\n\nself and other. Is a nation a measure for sharing\n\nresponsibility. To what extent is humanity solidarity.\n\nCommunity spirit is not a shared spirit, but\n\neveryone’s spirit separately. All rules hold in war\n\nand love. You hate and I love. War legitimates\n\ncrimes against the person. People who would not\n\notherwise commit suicide have themselves killed.\n\nA military uniform has a civilian body.\n\nNovska, Croatia. July 1992\n\nAs well as lives, war destroys objects. Buildings,\n\nroads, bridges, towns and villages. War makes the\n\nbeautiful and the ugly the same. A thousand raped\n\nwomen are the same as one. These borders\n\nbegotten by war function as they survive like time\n\nbombs. Kosovo and Macedonia wait their turn.\n\nThe long systematic superpower policy of a nation\n\nhas come to the end of its road. The nation chooses\n\nits leaders; the leaders choose the enemy.\n\nHellas-Express, 20 may 1998,\n\nbetween Budapest and Belgrade\n\nThe train is short and empty for an international\n\nexpress, a vehicle between two capitals. Warfare\n\nleaves its mark on relations between countries.\n\nI think about the influence of cultures on the\n\ncultivation of hatred on the part of different nations\n\nand the justification of cultures which in one way\n\nor another raise themselves above the rest.\n\nAre there any cultures in existence which\n\nmean well to everyone.\n\n… in the same train near Subotica,\n\non the Yugoslavian border\n\nA middle-aged woman rushes out of the forest\n\ntoward the train, gesturing with her hands as if she\n\nwere waving at the passengers. At the same time\n\nthree man-sized plastic bags fly out of the last\n\ncarriage. Now I understand the sounds of\n\nsellotaping I heard earlier. Smugglers. They were\n\nwrapping sacks together. Two of the sacks burst as\n\nthey hit the ground at high speed. They hurl their\n\ncontents like slowly exploding stars. Small objects\n\nfly, each its own celestial body, along the railway\n\nembankment. Strange that the border officials do\n\nnot intervene. Perhaps they take their cut. Taxed by\n\neconomic sanctions, Yugoslavia accepts everything\n\nit can get.\n\nAnother frontier, the Skopje-Pristina road, August 1998\n\nThe clock on the bus has stopped. The conductor\n\nmoves its hands to the right time every twenty\n\nminutes. More luggage is lifted into the coach\n\nbefore the border. A child’s plastic tricycle in the\n\ncorridor, and taped-up packages between the seats.\n\nThere are already bulky packages on the seats;\n\nvisible through the plastic are shoes and clothes\n\nand other easily saleable things: household tools,\n\nfruit baskets and cleaning materials.\n\nFrontiers give a direction to poverty. Poverty runs\n\nupstream. It does not obey the laws of physics.\n\nThe Macedonian border police officer, a smiling\n\nwoman, calls the frontier the Serbian frontier.\n\nNot the frontier of Kosovo or Yugoslavia.\n\nSo Kosovo is in Serbia.\n\nPrishtina, Kosovo. August 1998\n\nYou have to choose your side. Every slightly more\n\nserious conversation leads to the question: whose\n\nside are you on? My friend, whose mother is a Serb,\n\nis suspect. It is not enough that she is against\n\ninjustice; her mother should become an Albanian.\n\n‘We came here five hundred years before the apes\n\nand another five hundred years before the devil,’\n\nsays Veton, a full Albanian. The Serbs are the\n\nAlbanians’ devils. Veton talks a lot. Each sentence\n\nseeks some difference between the Albanians and\n\nthe Serbs. The occupation must be removed, even if\n\nit takes a thousand years.\n\nLlausha, Kosovo. August 1998\n\nIn the ravine is a bus which has burnt to a rusty\n\nskeleton. It was rammed there. From the sturdy\n\ncartridge cases you can see how the tanks have\n\nstopped here to fire for a long time. The militia\n\ngesture to us angrily from the shelter of sandbags\n\nto drive on. We may not stop. The battles continue.\n\nI remember Llausha in May, when the first grenades\n\nexploded there. Then the situation was different.\n\nWe avoided the army’s road closures by using the\n\nforest road that descends to the village from\n\nbehind. Now Llausha is tightly surrounded,\n\nand no one is allowed in.\n\nRausic, Kosovo. August 1998\n\nTwo fire-engine-red tractors dash out in front of us\n\nfrom side roads, driven by Serb militiamen. Behind\n\nthem, through the woods, we can see a house which\n\nhas just been set on fire. On each tractor is a\n\nblueuniformed man, his back to the engine, legs\n\ndangling. The real owners of the vehicles and the\n\nhouses are Albanians who have been expelled.\n\nThe militiamen are cheerful and carefree. The life’s\n\nwork of the people they hate burn in a couple of\n\nhours to hollow cores; courtyards fall silent and\n\nbecome soundlessly smouldering smoke. Around the\n\nempty villages, loose cattle feed in the maize fields.\n\nIt is the only thing which happens here without evil\n\nintentions, with a good conscience.\n\nJunik, Kosovo. August 1998\n\nA horse walks toward me on a deserted village\n\nstreet. No villagers are visible. Four cows are on\n\nthe loose in the nearby byre, and at their feet is a\n\nhen and her chicks. Two militiamen sit on guard in a\n\ncafé that has been shot to shreds. The militia forces\n\nhave just taken Junik after heavy fighting. The\n\nvillage is important to both sides. To the Albanians,\n\nit is a web-page icon. Behind the bar, beside some\n\npostcards, hangs a 50 billion dinar note from 1993.\n\nIts value lies in its valuelessness. ’Take it as a\n\nsouvenir!’ say the militiamen. I do.\n\nOrahovac, Kosovo. August 1998\n\nThe style of the guards at the check-point\n\nis aggression. The group displays the\n\nfashionconsciousness of the paramilitary:\n\nscarves on heads or wound round necks,\n\na few earrings and Rayban glasses.\n\nEveryone has an assault rifle in his\n\nhand and on his feet boots fit for kicking.\n\nThe armour-covered bodies are strongly built.\n\nThe men’s movements are restless and impressive;\n\nlike copies of violent American films that have\n\nbeen seen many times. Around are stolen cars\n\nwith doors sprayed with Orthodox symbols and\n\nthe text: Serbia belongs to the Serbs.\n\nThe heat sends the men crazy. Selfesteem\n\nis fragile, and always on the trigger.\n\nBelgrade, Serbia. September 1998\n\nSasha draws the sign of a cross on a piece of paper\n\nand shows how Serbia is defending Christianity.\n\nThen he draws a half-moon and scribbles on it\n\nquickly so that finally there is a thick cross on\n\ntop of the halfmoon.\n\n’The Muslims must be destroyed!’ Sasha\n\nsays. ‘No one can be neutral!’ he says, meaning me,\n\nso sharply that it sounds like science.\n\nBelgrade-Banja Luka road, September 1998\n\nThe division of Yugoslavia is traumatic in many\n\nways. We drive along the Sava river on the Serb\n\nRepublic side. ’That’s Croatia. So near, and yet so\n\nfar,’ says the bus-driver’s assistant, pointing to the\n\nother side of the river. Empty villages as far as the\n\neye can see as we approach Derventa. Shot-out\n\nhouses, uninhabited. Sometimes, evenly, every\n\nbuilding is a ruin, sometimes there is an occasional\n\nundamaged one, as if by accident in the midst of\n\nthis otherwise fragmented settlement. Just before\n\nthe town there is an apartment block that has\n\nremained a building site, beside it a crane stopped\n\nby the explosion, distorted but still ready to\n\ncomplete its task.\n\nBanja Luka, the Serb Republic of Bosnia. September 1998\n\nSavo, who is wounded in his feet, curses the mines.\n\nA bullet makes a soldier inactive for a moment,\n\na mine for the rest of his life. More than his own\n\nwounds, he is depressed on behalf of his son:\n\nas they exploded, the grenade-detonators he had\n\nfound took almost all of the sight of both his son’s eyes.\n\nWe set out from the hospital toward the centre of\n\nBanja Luka. The man sitting beside me says he\n\nserved in the mines troops throughout the war.\n\nHe says he set five thousand mines.\n\nIt is a lot for one man.\n\nSarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. October 1998\n\nThe consequences of war become everyday life.\n\nLife before the war seems unreal and distant.\n\nLife now is a pile of difficulties, poverty and incapacity.\n\nEven the well have their difficulties, but there is no\n\ndemand for defective body. The burden is multiplied\n\nsince the troubles are almost always both physical\n\nand economic.\n\nKorde’s life was good before the war, but now he\n\nfeels as if there was no life before the war.\n\nA grenade fell on Vase Miskina street and killed\n\n17 people. It put Korde into a coma, and of the year\n\nthat followed he remembered nothing. A year later,\n\na grenade that hit the courtyard of his home\n\nknocked him unconscious again. It restored his\n\nmemory. When he came to, he realised\n\nthat this was war.\n\nSarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. October 1998\n\nOn Lepir’s hands are two eternally tattooed loves:\n\nthe initials of the Yugoslav People’s Army, JNA, and\n\nthe woman of his youth who never became his wife.\n\nAlso his relationship with the People’s Army\n\nchanged with time. He moved from behind the gun\n\nto in front of the gun.\n\nSarajevo became a city on which 1,000,000\n\ngrenades were fired in three and a half years.\n\nAs a target, it was easy. Sarajevo lies at the\n\nbottom of a deep valley. The Serbs surrounded\n\nthe city with their artillery and their sharp-shooters,\n\nand transformed it into a hell on earth.\n\nThe kilometres which, now I have walked them,\n\nhave raised a blister on the sole of my foot,\n\nwould during the siege probably have taken\n\nmy whole foot, if they had not perhaps killed me.\n\nSarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. October 1998\n\nAjla lives in a short stretch of street in the centre of\n\ntown. She points to her window, next to which is an\n\nempty, blown-up apartment. It was hit by a rocket.\n\nEveryone died. The marks left in the streets by the\n\nshells are called roses after the patterns they\n\nmake. The senders of those flowers were known,\n\nbut anonymous.\n\nSarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. October 1998\n\nBosnia is a weak business that has already gone\n\nbankrupt. Its economy is full of corruption, which is\n\nas invisible as the money that disappears into it.\n\nThere is dissatisfaction with the UN.\n\nThe UN, however, can be seen, but money\n\ncan disappear even into visibility.\n\nThe resuscitation of the community is\n\nagonisingly slow. It is not yet certain\n\nwhether it will succeed. The body has\n\nonly just been found.\n\nVukovar, Croatia. June 1999\n\nRuined houses in Croatia are divided into six\n\ndifferent classes, according to their condition.\n\nOnly houses of the sixth class of destruction\n\nare replaced with completely new ones.\n\nMany new houses are being built in Vukovar.\n\nDuring the period between August and\n\nNovember 1991, 850,000 rounds of\n\nheavy ammunition were fired into Vukovar,\n\nmore per hour than wartime Sarajevo.\n\nWith that quantity of explosives, the Serbs took\n\ncontrol of the town for seven years.\n\nEasternmost Slavonia and with it Vukovar\n\nwere ceded back to Croatia by decision\n\nof the UN in 1998.\n\nBetween Osijek and Vinkovci, Croatia. June 1999\n\nMany fields on the old battlefronts have grown wild.\n\nThey are unpredictably mined. That is why no one\n\ndares enter them. Liberated from people,\n\nplant species behave like people conquering land:\n\nfirst come the greediest, then it is the toughest\n\nthat settle.\n\nOsijek, Croatia. June 1999\n\n‘Of soldiers who served at the front, 268 have\n\ncommitted suicide this year,’ says Tomislav. ’They\n\nshould take better care of people. They take even\n\nless notice of civilian victims.’ The grenade that hit\n\nhim had his name written on it. That is what he says.\n\nAs if the inevitable must always happen. It is\n\nworth believing, so that life is not unjust.\n\nTomislav finds it difficult to bear the numbing\n\nCroatian chauvinism of the radio and television.\n\nHe knows he is a Croat, and that should be enough.\n\nExtreme nationalist movements are at the height\n\nof their popularity throughout the Balkans.\n\nIt is understandable. Each group has deep suffering\n\nfresh in its memory. It seems compulsory to belong\n\nto the natio-nalist parties, otherwise all the\n\nsuffering would have been in vain. If the end result\n\nof the war were the same as where it started,\n\nthe war would have been in vain.\n\nPrishtina, Kosovo. June 1999\n\nLulzim has just returned home from the refugee\n\ncamp. At home the clock is still on wintertime.\n\nHis family is coming after him. They had to\n\nleave Kosovo on the last day of March.\n\nThey didn’t suffer the worst. Many people died\n\nor were mugged. The war, as it progresses,\n\nis evolutionary: cruel becomes crueller.\n\nProgress is human nature, both as a\n\npsychological property and in technical solutions.\n\nThere would be no weapons, either, if they were not\n\ncapable of killing.\n\nFerizaj, Kosovo. town hospital morgue, June 1999\n\nSerbs or Albanians. The unidentified bodies all look\n\nthe same. The speechlessness of the dead conceals\n\ntheir ethnic origin. Unbreathing, they lie in peace,\n\nside by side. The American soldier said they were\n\nSerbs, but the Albanian doctor claims he does not\n\nknow the victims’ identity. Whether or not they are\n\nAlbanians, none of them have papers. The doctor is\n\nwaiting for relatives to fetch the bodies. I don’t\n\nunderstand. Who are the relatives, if no one knows\n\nwho the bodies are?\n\nPrishtina, Kosovo. June 1999\n\nDespite the presence of Nato, there are weapons\n\neverywhere. Today there was a shooting incident in\n\nthe hospital. A Serb man threatened a doctor and\n\nthen shot the medications officer. A black American\n\nsoldier came toward me, carrying the wounded\n\nprisoner. ‘Stand back!’ he shouted at me, and\n\ndisappeared past me through the door.\n\nBelgrade, Serbia. October 1999\n\nFrom the street scene, it is impossible to infer the\n\nstate of the nation. People are well-dressed,\n\ngenerally according to the weather and their own\n\ninclinations. The lack of heating in the apartments\n\ndoes not affect life outdoors. If there is a shortage\n\nof fuel, people walk more. Since they cannot afford\n\nto travel, people spend less time away from the city.\n\nSome people, in difficulties with their livelihood, sell\n\ntheir possessions in the street. In addition,\n\ncountless refugees walk the streets. Distress\n\nenlivens the street scene, deceiving the outsider\n\ninto optimism.\n\nBelgrade, Serbia. October 1999\n\nWars have their internal political objectives. This\n\ncountry is privatised between the army, the secret\n\npolice and the political elite. Built in to Serbia is its\n\nfaithful nomenklatura, which repeats its leaders\n\nwords with the accuracy of a microphone.\n\nBut thereare other people in the country.\n\nThe sustenance of the internal order of the state\n\nis like a stationary war in which battle-lines are\n\nunknown because the enemies are contained\n\nwithin the community which is to be protected.\n\nAll that is left of the federation are Serbia and\n\nMontenegro. Kosovo is, in practice, lost. What then,\n\nis the position of Vojvodina, which the war has left\n\nalmost untouched and which was stripped of its\n\nautonomy at almost the same time as Kosovo.\n\nThreat or victim. To people who live there,\n\nthe Nato bombings seemed unjust. Among their\n\nown people, there is also understanding.\n\n’The bridges of Novi Sad were not toppled into\n\nthe river by American missiles, but as early as 1991\n\nby the weight of flowers thrown on to JNA tanks\n\nas they made their way toward Vukovar,’\n\nwas the writer Nenad Canak’s comment after the\n\nAmericans destroyed the bridges with rockets.\n\nBelgrade, Serbia. October 1999\n\nDuring the Nato bombings, the German mark was a\n\nstrong currency, international products were\n\navailable and MacDonald’s was open. The American,\n\nGerman and French cultural institutes in Kneza\n\nMihaila suffered almost as sad a fate as the Nato-bombed\n\nChinese embassy, although without human\n\ncasualties. They still stand empty and dirtied,\n\nwaiting for better times, which will come just as\n\nsurely as they will be followed by worse ones.\n\n’The time of the bombings was unreal. In the\n\nevenings, there were no street lamps or people in\n\nthe streets, apart from dog-walkers. The city was\n\nempty. It was like something out of Bladerunner.\n\nErase the street lights. Enter. Street lights erased.\n\n– Erase the people. Enter. People erased. All the\n\ntrouble considered, it was a learning experience.\n\nThere’s no doubt that I see my life more clearly\n\nnow. Everything is crystal clear,’ says Milena.\n\nBelgrade, Serbia. October 1999\n\nThe waitress suddenly loses her temper. From\n\nbehind me comes a bloodcurdling scream, followed\n\nby an angry outpouring of which I understand only\n\nthe word ‘Milosevic’. A man replies, and from his\n\nspeech I understand the word ‘police’. I also\n\nunderstand that within the coldness of Belgrade\n\nthere broods a volcano which awaits eruption.\n\nPeople are anxious. It does not help that yesterday\n\nthe radiators were tepid. Today they are cold.\n\nGorazde, Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nNovember 1999\n\nIn the courtyards of the blocks are as many piles of\n\nlogs as there are flats in the buildings. The vision is\n\nnostalgic, the life it contains arduous. Residents\n\nhave to heat their own spaces themselves. The logs\n\nare piled up into stacks of different kinds. Most of\n\nthem are covered with sheets of plastic; others are\n\nsheltered by the topmost logs. The situation is the\n\nsame on the other side of the border, in the Serb\n\nRepublic. I remember its capital Banja Luka\n\npreparing itself for the coming winter, the sound of\n\nlogs being chopped everywhere and the horsedrawn\n\ndiesel saw that tours the city.\n\nMostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nDecember 1999\n\nHistory does not repeat itself. History is repeated\n\nby the people. Why do wars break out, if no one\n\nwants them? Are war and peace the same\n\nmeasurable time? Do wars end when they end, or is\n\npeace a lobby for war, an antechamber of conflict.\n\nThe children of war will always find a wet-nurse\n\nin history.\n\nThe people of the same town shoot one another\n\nhere, too. There are many estimations of the\n\nreasons for the Balkan conflicts. Much has been\n\nsaid about ethnic difference and the poor tolerance\n\nof religions for other religions, or that it was only in\n\nthe Balkans that the Second World War was finally\n\nfought to the end. Perhaps none of these alone,\n\nbut all of them together. Here, the east and west of\n\nEurope cast a joint shadow. The sky mixes the land.\n\nThere are many gods; the devils are the\n\npeople themselves.\n\nSarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. December 1999\n\nBranislava has travelled from Belgrade to Sarajevo\n\nfor a conference of cultural people. It would not be\n\nextraordinary, except that this is her first time since\n\nthe war. She stammers her astonishment again and\n\nagain. The city is not, in her opinion, as it was;\n\nin the streets one continually sees only scarf-headed\n\ngirls, in other words Muslims. The moment is,\n\nhowever, exaggerated. A religious occasion has just\n\nfinished nearby, and people returning from it fill the street.\n\nFormer Foca, present-day Srbinja, the Serb Republic of Bosnia. December 1999\n\nHuman beings are the only animals who make\n\nwritten agreements. The power of signatures is\n\nenormous, until they are overturned by someone\n\nwith greater power. In war, the property to be\n\ndivided is places with all their property. Rights are\n\nsought with wrongs. Missiles are used instead of\n\nmoney. The object of trade is easier to capture when\n\nthe seller is absent. Borders between states show\n\nwhere the conflict last ended.\n\nTranslated by Hildi Hawkins"
