        "text": "I am talking about Kosova and not Vlora or Albania proper. I am not sure how nationalist sources from the 17th century are cheap nationalist propaganda. None of these sources support that Albanians in Kosova are Ottoman transplants or loyal servants. It is completely rubbish. They talk even of Serbs in Kosova joining Ottoman forces. You did not provide a single historical evidence for any of your claims. Albanians in Kosova and Northern Albania led an anti-Ottoman resistance in 1690 and later. They do not speak of vast majority of people joining Ottoman forces. The Albanian Catholic Archbishop led an anti-Ottoman resistance yet in Serbian sources it is claimed it was the Serbian Orthodox Arsenije who then supposedly led 30,000 - 40,000 Serbsa out of Kosova, in some sources they claim 100,000's yet there is no historical evidence for this.\n\nNone of these sources mention the Serbian Arsenije.\n\nClementa = Kelmendi .... There is no mention of any Arsenije. Other sources mention the Archbishop of Albania. Prizren is mentioned as capital of Albania.\n\nThe Balkan Wars came after an Albanian revolt in Kosova in 1912 which weakened the Ottoman Empire https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_revolt_of_1912 , The Ottoman Empire in Kosova and Macedonia was practically defeated by Albanians according to other sources.\n\nIn Kosova is where the Albanian national movement began such as the League of Prizren, League of Peja etc, it first seeked greater rights within the empire then later independence. None of these sources support that we were loyal servants or the only servants or that we terrorized Serbs or that we were transplanted in Kosova.\n\nThose Pashas and people you are talking about mainly took advantage of their circumstances, they served the Ottoman empire to get a carrier within the military or as officers then when the time came they also changed sides. It was like this with all nationalities. I don't think you even understood the word 'loyal servant' here. The Austrians also mistreated people. They burned down Skopje. In Skopje there were recorded 3,000 Jews that fled because of the Austrians. Yes many of these Albanians that revolted had been paid wages as soldiers by Ottomans but they weren't 'loyal servants' , they were people that adopted to their circumstances to make a life.\n\nJust like people joined the Roman Empire when the Romans occupied the Balkans, people adopted Latin and served the Romans eventually despite they had revolted against the Romans, the Roman Empire eventually also collapsed. This does not make you a 'loyal servant' . People joined based on their interests.\n\nNone of these sources support the Balkans had supposedly ethno-nationalist conflicts before the 19th-20th century.\n\nLoyal servant or “Sadik” is a consideration that should be seen with the eyes of Turks/ottomans not Albanians. For that you should read ottoman archives. With all the evidence you provided, It seems that only Albanians from Albanian were loyal servants not Albanians Kosovars. Albanian from Albania declared independence and two years latter asked for a Turkish prince, lowered the Albanian flag in Durres and raised the Turkish one, if this is not a proof worth considering, I don’t know what is.\n\nSent from my iPhone using Eupedia Forum\n\nOnce again I have to repeat myself,\n\nIn Kosova/Northern Albania far more people supported the Austrians than Ottomans. You can just look at the numbers.\n\nPrizren was an Albanian town. Western Kosova had an Albanian majority yet you claim this is nationalistic nonsense when we are literally using sources from the 17th century ? It seems Serbian propaganda really got into your head. There is no evidence that our people were ever loyal Ottoman servants while people like the Serbs were supposedly oppressed people who constantly fought the Ottomans. This is exactly what is complete nationalistic nonsense actually and is based on nothing but racism, depicting us as some kind of terrorist alien Islamic people while the 'Chrsitian Serbs' as oppressed and Europes chosen people that were pushed out from Kosova. Many Christians served the Ottomans. In fact they preferred them to stay Christian so they would also pay taxes.\n\nCatholics among the Ottomans came to be despised largely because the Austrians were Catholics and the Albanian Catholics of Northern Albania and Kosova that led some of these revolts with both Christian and Muslim Albanians.\n\nThere is a difference between being a servant and being a loyal servant, just because you're a servant doesn't make you loyal.\n\nWhen Albanians fought Skanderbeg under the Ottomans they were 'loyal' servants ? Why would we be 'loyal' when they committed attrocities ? When the Austrians committed crimes people stopped being loyal to the Austrians.\n\nBalkan Wars happened largely thanks to the Albanian revolt of 1912. It's true that we didn't seek initially independence from the Ottomans but more rights. You seem to be unaware of many of the revolts against Ottomans that happened in Albania and Kosovo in the 1800's and 1900's.\n\nYou pulled out some Pashas of Albania as supposedly some evidence and some people that served in the Ottoman ranks. Yes many Albanians served in Ottoman ranks as did Janissaries, many Albanians moved to Turkey, this certainly has absolutely no proof that Albanians were loyal servants while other Balkan nations such as Serbs supposedly were oppressed people that constantly fought against Ottoman occupation, many Albanians also opposed the Ottomans when given chance. Many Balkan Slavs served in the Ottoman ranks too even if the number of Albanians was greater, it is certainly no proof that Albanians are Ottoman transplants and the 'Christian Serbs' oppressed and rebellious people.\n\nIf you had actually bothered reading what I wrote it was a response to Tim Judah's claim that this revolt in 1690 was a Serbian revolt and that after 1690 the demographics began to change into Albanian thanks to 'loyal Albanian servants' of the Ottomans. The texts I provided prove this is rubbish yet you claim this is all nationalistic nonsense ?\n\nYou are mixing two different periods with over 200 years in between. For the period we are talking about, Albanians in Kosove were predominantly Catholic. Especially in the rural regions.\n\nMany Albanians in Kosova were already Muslims actually. Prizren in Kosova was mostly Muslim Albanian, so was Vushtrri etc. Many of these people who revolted were Muslim and they are mentioned as Muslim who had formerly fought in the Ottoman ranks and were paid wages, some are mentioned as faithless, some sources mention them as both Muslim and Christians. There are Serbs mentioned also and they also mention Serbs in the Ottoman ranks.\n\nThough you are right there were also Catholics. But there were also Catholics from Northern Albania that came assist if you read Noel Malcolm's essay on this.\n\nThe guy has absolutely no idea what he is talking about. In Serbian and Western media this whole revolt is depicted as Serbian, while Albanians were people who supported the Ottomans. It is then claimed Serbs departed. The texts of these periods easily prove this is nonsense.\n\nServing in the Ottoman ranks certainly does not make you a loyal servant. They were paid wages and all Balkan people did this to some degree.\n\nThey chose side based on their interests when the time came down to it. National unity etc did not exist at the time.\n\nNot much historical evidence that supports our people were constant 'loyal' Ottoman servants while the Serbs were rebellious liberators that were pushed out. In fact, many Serbs settled Kosova during the Ottoman period, 1700's, 1800's etc. Also some Vlachs. I am not sure what the guy is even trying to get at. One can easily read texts from these periods to prove this is nonsense.\n\nIn Kosova we did not become the absolute majority until the mid/late 1800's for example when they expelled Albanians from what is today South-Eastern Serbia.\n\nPrizren was mostly Muslim, Vushtrri etc was mostly Muslim. The guy who led the anti-Ottoman resistance was Bogdani, a Catholic, but there were both Muslims and Catholics in the ranks. The 5,000 Arnauts mentioned were mostly Muslim, many if not most of the 20,000 Arnauts mentioned were also Muslim as were many of the 6,000. Arnaut was also a term for a Muslim Albanian.\n\nSo much for 'loyal servants' , the guy has swallowed too much Serbian and Western propaganda that seems to confuse religious affiliation with being pro-Ottoman. These texts clearly mention Christian Serbs in the ranks among the Ottoman army, texs also mention Christians on the Ottoman side in the battle of Kosovo 1389 and 1448.\n\nSeems like I am having a debate with a guy who has absolutely no idea about Albanian history. Does not even seem to be aware of the Albanian national awakening or the various revolts against the Ottomans.\n\nBalkan Wars would of never happened had it not been for these revolts first of all. It is pretty much what allowed the Serbs to invade Albanian lands since it pretty much weakened if not practically defeated the Ottoman Empire. Yet claims we would of never had our independence...\n\nQUOTE:\n\n''\n\nAnd a further complication is introduced by\n\nthe term 'Arnaut', which could be used\n\nas a synonym for Albanian but tended\n\nto suggest those Albanians (in the ethnic-linguistic sense)\n\nwho acted as soldiers for the Ottomans-though these it should be noted\n\nincluded Catholic Albanians as well as Muslim ones.\n\nPiccolomini then moved to Prizren, where he was met by the Catholic\n\nArchbishop Pjeter Bogdani. This was not\n\ntheir first meeting: soon after the arrival of the Austrians in Kosovo,\n\nBogdani had gone to see Piccolomini to request that the soldiers\n\nwould not molest members of his flock. No doubt\n\ntheir discussion at that previous meeting had\n\nincluded suggestion that Bogdani rally the population\n\nof Prizren in support of the Austrians;\n\nand so it was that, in Contarinis words,\n\nNear Prizren, as Piccolomini was approaching\n\n, the inhabitants came out to meet him with festive\n\nshouts: they were 5,000 in number and were led by their Archbishiop,\n\nholding a banner with an image of the Holy Cross.\n\nIn 1624, Pjeter Mazrreku reported that Prizren had roughly\n\n200 Catholic inhabitants and 600 Servani. But the great bulk\n\nof the population, 12,000 people in 1624 - were Muslims, almost\n\nall of them Albanians.\n\nNo doubt the 5,000 who came out to welcome Piccolomini\n\ndid include many of the local Christians, both\n\nCatholic and Orthodox, but they can hardly have accounted\n\nfor more than fifth of that crowd..\n\nIt is surely significant that one of the earliest printed accounts of\n\nthese events, an anonymous text based on original documents, refers to\n\nPiccolomini being greeted at Prizren by '5,000 Arnauts, who were partly Christian\n\nAlbanians and partly Muslim Albanians\n\nMazrreku also noted that the conversion to Islam was quite supperficial;\n\nin 1671 another report on this area stated\n\nthat '28 years ago there were many Christians[Catholics] now there remain\n\n300 women and very few men, the rest having abjured their faith\n\nin order to escape impositions and taxes.\n\n''\n\nMany Albanians in Kosova were already Muslims actually. Prizren in Kosova was mostly Muslim Albanian, so was Vushtrri etc. Many of these people who revolted were Muslim and they are mentioned as Muslim who had formerly fought in the Ottoman ranks and were paid wages, some are mentioned as faithless, some sources mention them as both Muslim and Christians.

One can easily read texts from these periods to prove this is nonsense.\n\nIn Kosova we did not become the absolute majority until the mid/late 1800's for example when they expelled Albanians from what is today South-Eastern Serbia.\n\nLook at the register of 16th century (1571). Muslims in the rural regions were still rare. This changes however drastically after the Bogdani campaign. But yeah, Vushtrri, Prizren, Peje and Prishtine were the centres that were pred Muslim from the early days. Most of the city dwellers later on also considering themselves to be Turks too.\n\nSure, this is also the time when animosities rise between Albanians and Serb communities in Kosove - after the Serbian atrocities in South-Eastern Serbia. Prior to that there were conflicts, but mostly local isolated incidents.\n\nregardless of ethnic-linguistic or\n\nreligious identity; and if the Ottomans\n\ndid seek out particular groups for\n\nspecially harsh treatment, they would have\n\ntargeted above all the Catholics\n\n(co-religionists of the Austrians),\n\nmost of whom were ethnically Albanian.\n\n(The Catholic population of Kosovo, said\n\nto be roughly 1,000 households-well\n\nover 5000 people-by Bogdani in the\n\nearly 1680s, was estiimated at 2,800\n\npeople in 1693)\n\nBut on the other hand there is evidence\n\nof a quite large drop in the population\n\nof the towns, most of which did not\n\nregain their pre-1690 levels until\n\nthe nineteenth century; and the towns-of\n\nwhich this part of the Balkans possesed an unusually\n\ndense network-were overhelmingly\n\npopulated by Muslim Albanians.(Jovan Cvijic's claim\n\nabout the departure of 35,000 - 40,000 Serb\n\nfamilies from Kosovo were implausible not only on\n\nnumerical grounds, but also because he described those families as mostly\n\nurban.) When an observer such as Joseph Muller\n\nconsidered the small size of the Serb\n\nOrthodox population of Peje in the 1830s-just 130 households,\n\ncompared with more than 2,000 Muslim\n\nhouseholds-he attributed this sorry state of affairs\n\nto the 'Great Exoduses' of the past; but if he had\n\nbeen able to consult Bogdani's detailed report\n\nof 1681, he would have found at that time the Serbs had\n\njust 100 households, and the Muslims 1,000\n\n...............................\n\nAs for the fighting men who\n\nsubsequently brought the total\n\n(at least in theory)\n\nto 20,000, some of these may also have\n\nbeen inhabitants of Prizren (which\n\nin 1670 had a population of roughly 50,000)\n\nbut the evidence suggests that others\n\nwere drawn from further afield. Contarini's account\n\nrefers to Piccolomini, on his sickbed in Prizren,\n\nreceiving 'the chiefs of the neighbouring peoples, who came\n\nto pay tribute to the Emperor with oaths of fealty.\n\nIf, as seems likely, some of these chiefs\n\nhad been summoned by Bogdani, we might expect them\n\nto have included leaders of Catholic clans in\n\nthe nearby parts of the Malesi; and, indeed,\n\nan Ottoman document written in February 1690(just three months later)\n\ndoes refer to a large group of mostly\n\nCatholic clans from that area ( including the warlike Fandi)\n\nwho had allied themselves with the Austrians.\n\nBut the pledge of the total of 20,000 may well have included other\n\nAlbanians from areas close to Prizren\n\nwho were no longer Catholic, having\n\nbeen converted to Islam within the previous two or three generations-for example,\n\nthe Shulla or Has region, where as Mazrreku reported in 1634,\n\nthere had previously been 50 Catholic parishes\n\nbut were now only five. Mazrreku also noted that the\n\nconversion to Islam was quite superficial; in 1671\n\nanother report on this area stated that\n\n'28 years ago there were many Christians[sc.Catholics]: now\n\nthere remain 300 women and very few men, the rest\n\nhaving abjured their faith in order to escape impositions and taxes.\n\nThe point here is not that such people nursed\n\na burning desire to restore,\n\none day, their Catholic identity(this may have been true in some cases,\n\nthose of the crypto-Christians, but these\n\nseem to have been few in number); rather, it is that\n\nrecent attachment to Islam may not have involved\n\nanything like religious conviction, and that it is therefore wrong to assume that such\n\npeople would have felt any special duty to support\n\nthe Ottoman state merely because they were Muslims.\n\nWhat was going on in the mind of any local person when he or she\n\ndecided to support the Austrians is difficult to reconstruct,\n\nand impossible to prove; but a modern approach which\n\nconverts religious identities automatically into some sort of equivalent\n\nof national identities, and then expects blocks of people\n\nto have behaved along those fixed lines,\n\nis unlikely to give us a true picture of seventeenth-century provincial Balkan realities.\n\nThe very small educated elite-the Christian clergy, above all-may have understood what Austria was,\n\nand what coming under its rule might mean; but ordinary\n\npeople, including clan elders, probably had only haziest idea.\n\nTheir recent experience of Ottoman rule was(contrary to what is implied in Stanford Shaw's account)\n\nextremely negative. Taxes and other exacations had, as always, risen sharply during the anti-Habsburg war;\n\nand, what is more, in 1687-9 the beylerbeyi of Rumeli, Yegen Osman\n\npasha, had treated the territories under his rule as a personal fiefdom\n\nto be milked of its riches, and had employed armies\n\nof personal retaines to plunder it. That\n\nmany local people might have welcomed as an alternative\n\na largely unknown power-one that promised to respect\n\ntheir local rights, and one that was being\n\npromoted by a local figure, the Catholic Archbishop,\n\nwhose moral authority extended beyond his own flock-should\n\nnot greatly surprise us.\n\nHowever, when we recognize that such attitudes could cut across\n\nreligious distinctions, this does not mean that we should fall back\n\ninto the categories of most nineteenth- and twentieth-century Serbian\n\nor Albanian historians, with their axiomatic assumptions about a 'national' identity\n\nthat always strove to throw off Ottoman rule. That\n\nmany Albanians continued to serve in the\n\nOttoman forces opposing the Austrians should not surprise us, even though we cannot\n\nreconstruct the precise combination of factors (economic interest, personal loyalty, local affiliation,\n\ncodes of honour, and so on) that may have been involved.\n\nSimilar considerations may apply to the case of the Slav Orthodox villagers of the Lume region\n\nSouth-west of Prizren, whose villages were burnt down by Holstein\n\nbecause he regarded them as hostile. One early account\n\ndescribed Mahmut Begolli's army as consisting of 'Rascians' as well as Albanians;\n\nsome of these 'Rascians' may also have been Orthodox Slavs.\n\n........................\n\nI personally don't see what this thread has anything to do with many Albanians being loyal to the Ottomans (Something many other Balkan people were too, used to even be lots of Greek Muslims, Turkified Muslims, Bulgarian Muslims, Serbian Muslims if you wanna relate religious affiliation to political ones, these nations also had a population exchange with Turkey exporting Muslims and Importing Orthodox) or serving in the Ottoman ranks or how it proves such theories. I am not even sure what you are trying to tell us here nor what it has to do with Kosova.\n\nThe claim here is that most Albanians were loyal Ottoman servants while most Serbs were a people that constantly fought to throw off Ottoman rule. These are clearly false narratives. Another claim is that the Serbs, since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation, were genocided and oppressed by Albanians which there is no evidence for. What they have done is that they have taken modern national identities and political conflicts and projected this into these past events.\n\nWhat has that to do with our independence or many Albanians serving the Ottoman Empire ?\n\nMany Albanian claims are absolutely exaggerated too but the Serbian ones have had the most impact.\n\nShow me evidence of loyal Ottoman Albanian servants being transplanted in Kosova between period of 1448 to 1690, that supposedly genocided and terrorized Serbs ? I would prefer also to see sources from these periods, not nationalist drivel written hundreds of years later."
