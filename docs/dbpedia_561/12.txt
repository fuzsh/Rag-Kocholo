Report on the Situation of Albanian-language Education in Kosova

The letter was signed August 12 1997 by Abdyl Ramaj, Secretary of the Commission for

Education of LDK, and Head of Parliamentary Commission for Education, Science, Culture

and Sports of Kosova. It was sent to Federico Mayor UNESCO General Director, as well

as to several embassies in Belgrade.

Text: THE SITUATION IN ALBANIAN EDUCATION IN KOSOVA AND

POSSIBILITIES FOR ITS TEMPORARY NORMALIZATION

Under the Constitution of Kosova and pursunat to appropriate laws provisions, Kosova

had full independence in regulating the education, science and culture, just like the other

republics of the former Yugoslavia.

Following the forceful annexation of Kosova and the suspension of its legitimate

institutions, the Serbian regime suspended all the Kosova institutions related to education.

It should be noted that the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Kosova

(Secretariat of Education, Science and Culture of Kosova) as the highest organ, as well as

other educational institutions, administered and maintained independently the entire

educational, cultural and scientific life in Kosova. As a result, the educational authorities of

Kosova were fully independent to compile and approve the curricula, to decide about the

network of schools, and to control the whole educational system of Kosova. Before the

Serb crack-down on Kosova, Albanian-language and Serb-language education functioned

as paralel mediums of educationn in Kosova.

THE DESTRUCTION OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN KOSOVA

The destruction of educational system of Kosova has been lasting process, yet it

intensified after 1981 with systametic persecution of students and teachers, the so-called

"political [communist] differentiation" or complete dismissal of teachers, annulment of

Kosova legislation on education, science and culture and introduction of Serb laws

instead, segregation through dividing Albanian and Serb schoolchildren into different

school buildings, etc. However, the process of destruction of Kosova education escalated

in 1990. In spring of that year, deliberate intoxication of around 7.400 Albanian

schoolchildren occurred in schools, while only a few months later, in autumn, the regime

began with the closure of secondary schools. By the end of 1990, the Serbian Parliament

decided that one half of secondary schools in Kosova be closed down, while in April of

1991 the Serb Parliament decided that only 28 per cent of pupils who were expected to

complete their primary education that year in Kosova could resume with their secondary

education. On force Serbia locked down school buildings of primary and secondary

education and the University of Prishtina. As a result 396 full-class [from 1st to 8th grade]

primary schools, 454 four-year and annex primary schools, 56 secondary schools, 7

teachers training and engineering colleges, and 13 faculties were closed down that year.

Around 14.500 primary and 4.000 secondary school and 862 University teachers were

dismissed. Owing to international pressure Serbia was forced to re-open most of the

primary schools in the meantime. Yet, schoolchildren of 41 elementary schools have not

been allowed to attend classes in their school ever since. The pupils of 11 such schools

have been sents to attend classes in other primary schools of the community, while those

of 26 others attend classes in make-shift classrooms in private houses. There are today

441 full elementary primary schools (pupils of 41 are not allowed access to school

buildings) with a total of 266.413 pupils and 13.585 teachers and other education-related

personnel in Kosova.

Out of 66 secondary schools operating today in Kosova, students of 6 of them only are

allowed access to their school buildings. All the rest attend classes in inadequate

makeshift classrooms in private houses and other buildings of community. Albanian

secondary school students are also denied access to their facilities: school libraries,

dormitories, sport halls (gyms) etc. As many as 58.700 students attend secondary school

education, with a teaching staff of 4.310.

More or less the situation is the same at the University of Prishtina. It has been six

years now since Albanian students were expelled from 7 high schools (colleges) and 13

faculties. Besides the lecturing halls, Albanian students are denied access to the

University Library, the libraries in faculties and departments, dormitories, dinning halls and

canteens, sports halls (gyms) etc. In the 1996/97 academic year, there were around

16.000 students (both full-time and part-time) studying at the Albanian-medium University

of Prishtina in make-shift classrooms and halls. The University teaching personnel is made

of 826 full-time teachers and 200 part-time and associate teachers.

1. The University of Prishtina has shared the fate of primary and secondary schools in

Kosova. Attacks at the Kosovar higher education began with the imposition of the so-

called emergency measures (coercive administration) at the Clinic of Gynecology and

Obstetrics of the Medical Faculty. All the Albanian-language personnel and other staff

were suspended. The Department of Surgery was to face the same measures very soon.

2. Emergency measures were introduced at the Medical Faculty (Official gazette 20/90;

26.09 1990). 90 per cent of the Albanian personnel (from academicians to nurses) were

dismissed. The Medical Faculty was in this way virtually closed down.

3. The Serbian regime extended a new law on students enrolment for the 1991/92

academic year (Official Gazette No.28/91; 31.05.1991). According to new legislation, the

enrolment ratio was to be 1:1 for Serbs and Albanians (1500 Albanian and 1500 Serb

The only Children's Books Publisher is Closed Down

Pursuant to the decision no.203 of 11 July 1991 of the Serbian Parliament, emergency

measures were imposed at the only children's book publisher in the former Yugoslavia.

The whole personnel of the Bureau for Textbook Publishers of Kosova was dismissed.

For five years now this textbook publishers company has been closed pursuant to Serb

laws.

In the beginning the primary spelling book (Abecedarium) was printed in Italy. It had to be

smuggled in the country in exceptionally dangerous circumstances. A limited number of

textbooks in Albanian for schoolchildren is being printed now in extremely grave

conditions.

1. Pursuant to decisions No.400 - 20/91 and 400/15/91 of 20 February 1991 of the Serb

Parliament, since January 1991, all the Albanians teaching with the 1st and 5th grade of

primary schools and 1st year of secondary schools had their wages cut.

2. Pursuant to Decision No.400-41/91 of 7 March 1991, the whole secondary school

teaching personnel in Albanian (around 5000 people) had their payment cut. .

3. Pursuant to Decision No.400-137/91 of 30 May 1991, the rest of the primary school

teaching personnel (around 14.500 persons) had their wages/salaries cut.

4. Pursuant to Decision No. 400-211/91 of 18 November 1991, the funds for higher

education of Kosova were cut.

What could be the measures for temporary normalization of the situation in Kosovar

education

Full normalization of the situation in Kosova education could only occur with the settlement

of the political status of Kosova. The current situation could be overcome if the issue is

treated as pure educational matter, by circumventing or reducing political implications

around it.

Within such a framework, 13 rounds of talks were held under the Geneva Conference with

the mediation of Ambassador Gert Ahrens. Later, under the mediation of the Vatican-

based Saint Egidio Community, an agreement was reached which provided for conditions

to removed the blockade from school premise and for an unconditional return of Albanian

schoolchildren and pupils to their schools. An Accord on this matter was signed by

presidents Dr. Ibrahim Rugova and Slobodan Milosevic. Regrettably, the Accord was

never implemented to this day.

We hope you will wield your influence in finding an acceptable settlement so that Albanian

pupils, students and teachers are allowed to return to their school facilities they were

expelled from through the use of force. A temporary solution should be to the issues

without prejudging the settlement of the political status of Kosova. Negotiations on such a

goal could at last result in the following:

I

1. To bring to an end all repression against Albania school, pupils, students, teachers and

other people involved in running Albanian-language education.

2. To allow Albanians access to education-related facilities, the ones they were in

possession of earlier:

a) to immediately release the buildings of 35 primary schools and their 'annex' classes.

b) To release all the school buildings of secondary education the Albanians were expelled

from, i.e. premises of 60 secondary schools and their accessory facilities: dormitories,

libraries, sports halls (gyms), etc.

c) To release university premises in 7 high schools (teachers training and engineering

colleges) and 13 faculties, as well as their accessory facilities: the University and National

Library, the institutes, dormitories, dinning halls and canteens, sports halls, etc.

II

TEMPORARY NORMALIZATION OF FINANCING THE EDUCATION

A normalization of the financing the Kosova education could only be reached with a final

settlement of the Kosova issue. However, a temporary solution to the matter could be

found through: the taxes collected from the citizens and the contribution Kosovars have

been paying, and their share in socially-owned production. An adequate fund could be

earmarked for the Kosova Financing Council.

III

Restoration of normality in the Kosova Textbook Publishers Bureau by releasing its

premises and the capital the Bureau used to possess.

IV

To allow a normal functioning of administering, professional and training institutions of

education: the Pedagogical Bureau of Kosova, municipal educational councils,

pedagogical and supervision services, etc.
