Learn more about the map styles

Each map type offers different information and each map style is designed for a different purpose. Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Political Map of Orahovac).

Political map

Political map shows how people have divided up the world into countries and administrative regions such as states, counties, provinces, municipalities and postal zones. Different colors represent different countries and regions, whereas different shades of one color represent their internal divisions.

The choice of color is not related to the characteristics of Orahovac, colors are assigned to countries and regions randomly. The capital is marked with a black star inside a white circle. Squares and circles of various size indicate other major cities.

Geographic map projection

A map projection is a way how to transform points on a Earth to points on a map. This map of Orahovac uses Plate Carree projection. The Plate Carree projection is a simple cylindrical projection originated in the ancient times. It has straight and equally spaced meridians and parallels that meet at right angles.

All projections from a sphere to a plane are distorted. The drawback of the Plate Carree projection is that it doesn't make an attempt to compensate for these distortions. For the general view of Orahovac, this is not a significant problem. The detailed maps use the Mercator projection which preserves the shape of small areas better.
