        "text": "1Niklas Luhmann (1927–1998) is considered one of the most sophisticated and influential sociologists of the second half of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, he is usually set apart from his peers who are better liked and cause less animosity in contemporary academic circles. The reason for this is quite simple. He refused to build his reputation in the usual way: addressing the most pressing concerns of public opinion, embracing causes of significant political appeal, and providing ready-made solutions to ease the evils of the present day. “I am the Lucifer of social theory,” Luhmann confessed while his face glowed with a mischievous smile during his last visit to London. If he is demonized, it is because he chose to be so. He enjoyed being a thinker of cult status; he resembled other illustrious German thinkers: Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, Eric Voegelin, and Leo Strauss, for example, using Luhmann a hermetic language to avoid theoretical simplifications but also to circumvent the need to take clear political stances. He preferred disciples rather than comrades, initiates who learned to move around the labyrinth, an image he frequently deployed to describe his body of work.\n\nBarbarism and the Construction of the Western Political Form\n\n11 Edith Hamilton and Huntington Cairns (eds), The Collected Dialogues of Plato Including the Letters, (...)\n\nSuch was the natural nobility of this city, so sound and healthy was the spirit of freedom among us, and the instinctive dislike of the barbarian, because we are pure Hellenes, having no admixture of barbarian in us. For we are not like many others, descendants of Pelops or Cadmus or Egyptus or Danaus, who are by nature barbarians, and yet pass for Hellenes, and dwell in the midst of us; but we are pure Hellenes, uncontaminated by any foreign element, and therefore the hatred of the foreigner has passed unadulterated into the life-blood of the city.\n\n13Polemos, a significant word in Heraclitus’s vocabulary, means that the conflict is everlasting and radical. It describes the free interplay of conflicting forces. The forces that ultimately intend to emerge, expand, and become enthroned. The tragedy is that these forces cannot coexist or differentiate their particular areas of influence over the same plane. Furthermore, they cannot help but define their existence on an unavoidable premise: the necessary annihilation of their opponents. Polemos speaks, therefore, of an extended and insoluble conflict. The relation between Barbarians and Greeks must be regarded, claims Plato, from the perspective of polemos. It is an existential issue, not an epistemic one. In order for the Greeks to exist, the Barbarians must be exiled or eliminated. Exclusion may be concrete or virtual. The former appeals to everyone’s conscience; it summons to war, to shed one’s own blood defending the city walls. The latter imposes an idea of the collective being; it demands becoming secluded from the Barbarians in order to relegate them, that is, from the realm of the visible. Barbarism is a representation of phusis that needs to remain outside the walls guarding the polis.\n\n15The law by which a universe comes into being is always the same: severance and closure. In other words: the institution of its own limits, of its own determinations (peras, a Greek concept later re-launched by Hegel as Bestimmtheit). It is worth remembering a book of invaluable importance for Luhmann if we want to understand what lies behind Plato as a thinker of the political form. In the introduction to the mathematics of his Laws of Form (1969), G. Spencer-Brown starts with the following lines:\n\n17 George Spencer-Brown, Laws of Form, New York, Julian Press, 1972, p. XXIX.\n\nA universe comes into being when a space is severed or taken apart. The skin of a living organism cuts off an inside from an outside. So does the circumference of a circle on a plane. By tracing the way, we represent such severance, […] we can begin to see how the laws of our own experience follow inexorably from the original act of severance.\n\n17Three important factors for understanding exclusion in the time of the ancient city derive from what has been expounded so far: space, time, and the internal organization of the polis.\n\nSpace\n\n18Existing as an area crisscrossed by distinctions, “the inside” is sustained by the idea of an outer space: “the outside.” This outside is a space without any kind of differentiations. The Greeks called it aperion: everything is mixed up together; there is no way to distinguish elements of a different nature. Using Luhmann’s vocabulary, and in this he follows Spencer-Brown, I would have to discuss the “unmarked space.”\n\n22Two examples from Greek literature – one classical and the other modern – help us to grasp the topics developed thoroughly in this section. I am thinking about the Bacchae by Euripides and a famous poem by Constantine Cavafy “Waiting for the Barbarians” (circa 1904).\n\n24All that Dionysius demands is humility. The bastard god does not fight to impose disorder within the city walls, the rampage of natural passions or even the return to that which has been reduced to the field of the invisible. He does not ask the Barbarians to flutter around the agora in a crazy frenzy. He simply demands acknowledgement. He petitions from nomos to remember from time to time that the social arrangement is equally indebted to the visible and the invisible, to what is determined and that which remains undetermined.\n\n25The Dionysian rite presupposes that the “inside” recognizes the weight of the “outside.” When the polis leaders refuse to bow to that which they do not dominate, the city’s order is put into question. Dionysius punishes the rulers with all his malicious fury: he destroys the symbols of visible power (the government palaces, for instance) and paves the way for the assassination of the great dignitaries (Penteus is dismembered by a mob of women). What is more, the enraged god upsets the hierarchies and the classifications in which the city is based. Women abandon, in the same way as in Aristophanes’ Ecclesiazusae, domestic life, the oikos, and become important characters in the public drama of Thebes. The natural order is violated: instead of giving birth, they murder their own children. Similar to what occurs in Aristophanes’ play, the women of Euripides try as hard as they can to eradicate distinctions between male and female, oikos and polis, the beautiful and the ugly, virtue and misdemeanour. The challenge to nomos is precisely to obliterate the order of distinctions.\n\n26According to Plutarch, Dionysius, the god of humid nature, and Apollo sign an agreement guaranteeing peace between the visibility in which the political city is based and the darkness that corresponds to the outside of the political order. Here is the pact: every two years the representative of luminosity yields his temple to the master of sombre passions for a few months. Dionysius celebrates his transitory rule by saluting that which brings about doubt over certitude, questions over axioms, wine over military training, theatrical representations over the proceedings in the political ecclesia. In Euripides’ play, as usually happens in classic tragedies, the chorus works as a representative of totality. From the beginning it warned of what the rulers ignored or pretended to ignore: the political form is the aggregate of marked and unmarked space.\n\n27Cavafy stands on the opposite side of the problem stated by Euripides. Cavafy’s polis lives obsessed with the “outside.” The city has mislaid haughtiness and has but a small bit of naiveté left. What would happen, the poet asks, if the barbarians no longer existed? Better still: what would be the consequences for the polis if the barbarians refused to play their role?\n\n23 C.P. Cavafy, “Waiting for the Barbarians” in The Complete Poems of C.P. Cavafy: A New Translation, (...)\n\n—Why should this anxiety and confusion\n\nsuddenly begin. (How serious faces have become.)\n\nWhy have the streets and squares emptied so quickly,\n\nand why has everyone returned home so pensive?\n\nBecause night’s fallen and the barbarians have not arrived.\n\nAnd some people came from the border\n\nAnd they say the barbarians no longer exist.\n\nNow, what will become of us without barbarians?\n\nThose people were some kind of solution.\n\nTime\n\n26 See François Châtelet,La Naissance de l’histoire: la formation de la pensée historienne en Grèce, (...)\n\nThe future is not just suffered and understood anymore; it is also wanted: since that very moment politics becomes normative; not only is it the key concept of every intelligibility of the past, but also it intends to be the way of acting towards the future and altering the course of events.\n\n28 Niklas Luhmann, Observations on Modernity, Stanford, Stanford University Press, 1998, p. 205.\n\nA system that may make use of memory permanently discriminates between forgetting and remembering. Structurally it is necessary (precisely because of the procedures of memory itself) to keep on permanently forgetting, to allow new information coming in. Since permanently remembering might in time lead to self-blockage. But this function may be, with exceptions, inhibited, when internal or external reasons so require it to consider identities and when it is necessary to bring back certain things to memory. Consequently, remembering is not a reflexive accomplishment, it is the repression of repression, since that is the only way in which a system can deal with what is happening permanently.\n\n35 Euripides, “Suppliant Women” in Suppliant Women; Electra; Heracles, Cambridge, Mass., Loeb Classica (...)\n\nPraise to the god who shaped in order’s mould\n\nOur lives redeemed from chaos and the brute,\n\nFirst by implanting reason, giving then\n\nThe tongue, word-herald, to interpret speech;\n\nEarth’s fruit for food, for nurturing thereof\n\nRaindrops from heaven, to feed earths fosterlings,\n\nAnd water her green bosom; therewithal\n\nShelter from storm, and shadow from the heat,\n\nSea-tracking ships, that traffic might be ours\n\nWith fellow-men of that which each land lacks;\n\nAnd for invisible things or dimly seen,\n\nSoothsayers watch the flame, the liver’s folds,\n\nOr from the birds’ divine things to be.\n\nThe Internal Organization of the Polis\n\nLuhmann Visits the Favela or How He Encountered “Barbarism” within the Contemporary World\n\n40One of Luhmann’s central topics of concern in the last years of his life reads as follows: where to locate the other side of modernity, its unmarked space? The issue was not easy to solve. After all, function systems are not limited to a precise geographical area. Western modernity had irreversibly colonized the world. It had shaped the world into its image, or so Luhmann believed.\n\n41The sociologist was somewhat ambivalent about the existence of an actual social formation at the margins of the modern world. And yet, during one of his frequent visits to Latin America, he discovered what became in his late social theory the other side of modernity: the slums, the favelas of the Global South.\n\n46 Niklas Luhmann in Moeller, Luhmann Explained, p. 269.\n\nTo the surprise of the well-meaning, it must be ascertained that exclusion still exists, and it exists on a massive scale and in such forms of misery that they are beyond description. Anybody who dares a visit to the favelas of South American cities and escapes alive can talk about this. […] To this effect, no empirical research is needed. Who trusts one’s eyes can see it and can see it impressively that all explanations at hand will fail.\n\n42Soon the shanty towns became a recurrent rhetorical instrument for Luhmann. They served to fight one of his favourite bête noires: universal integration. Luhmann, the devil’s advocate of European social theory, recognized in the favelas the impossibility of modern society to deliver its ultimate promise: total social inclusion. Shanty towns assisted him as well with two other purposes that I am interested in dwelling on for a moment. The first was to demarcate the limits of his scientific method, and the second, to issue the theorization of negative integration on a global-scale. The interesting thing is that to a great extent these two intents are at odds with each other.\n\n43The slums helped Luhmann to demarcate his area of scientific competence. Regarding this, I want to point out both an ethical and a methodological question. Charles Sanders Peirce and Ludwig Wittgenstein’s influence is felt here; nothing substantial can be said about certain things, and in this sense, it is better to keep quiet. Otherwise, in the best case, literature is made and in the worst, an ideology, but never science properly speaking. In the favelas, everything is a sensory experience creating emotional ups and downs. A first-order observation was more than enough to discover the eternal truths of the favelas. In the shanty town, the body reigns supreme, and the body abandoned to its desires subtracts itself from the requirements of both the function systems and the advanced precepts of communication. There, where there is only body, social sciences do not have anything to say, or explanation to offer. Social scientists have the same degree of understanding as any other person who witnesses the calamity to which its inhabitants are subjected.\n\n44Something similar happened to Claude Lévi-Strauss on the streets of Calcutta. His principles of structural anthropology proved insufficient to find a substratum of social meanings for what was assaulting his senses. His only option was to allow his pen to flow, to report what was a sensorial experience of poverty. I reproduce a passage from Tristes Tropiques (1955) to illustrate the feelings of a scientist facing the ultimate limit of his anthropological lenses:\n\n47 Claude Lévi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques New York, Atheneum, 1973, p. 134.\n\nWhether we are considering the mummified towns of the Old World or the fetal cities of the New, we are accustomed to associate our highest values, both material and spiritual, with urban life. But the large towns of India are slum areas. What we are ashamed of as it were a disgrace and regard as a kind of leprosy, is, in India, the urban phenomenon, reduced to its ultimate expression: the herding together of individuals whose only reason for living is to herd together in millions, whatever the conditions of life may be. Filth, chaos, promiscuity, congestion; ruins, huts, mud, dirt; dung, urine, pus, humours, secretions and running sores: all the things against which we expect urban life to give us organized protection, all these by-products of cohabitation do not set any limitation on it in India. They are more like a natural environment in which the Indian town needs to prosper. To every individual, any street, footpath or alley affords a home, where he can sit, sleep, and even pick up his food straight from the glutinous filth. Far from repelling him, this filth acquires a kind of domestic status through having been exuded, excreted, trampled on and handled by so many men.\n\n45It is Luhmann’s turn now. He is telling the story of his walks around the Brazilian metropolises:\n\n48 Luhmann, “Inclusion-Exclusión,” p. 38.\n\nIf one visits, for example, a megacity in Brazil and walks along its squares, avenues, beaches, a continuous observation of one’s own position, of the distance, of the accumulation of human bodies to feel competent is necessary. Foreigners are warned of the danger, but this does not help to evaluate certain situations appropriately. Rather one has the feeling that things are perceived by intuition, which helps to recognize possible dangers and to avoid them. Contrariwise, strangers are perceived as objects of aggression, only as bodies. Everything that we are supposed to perceive under the term of person steps back, and this way any attempt of producing social effects by means of the capacity to influence others is also cancelled. To that end, a context of social control and a common social context that is not presupposed in advance would be necessary.\n\nMisfortune (malheur) under this aspect is horrifying, as life in the nude always is; like a stump, like the tingling of insects. Life without form. Surviving is then the only attachment.\n\n52 Simone Weil quoted by Roberto Esposito, El Orígen de la Política: Simone Weil o Hannah Arendt, Barc (...)\n\nThe moments in which it is bound to maintain simple existence as the only aim is total horror, horror in its purest state.\n\n48In this tenor, it is uncomplicated to trace the link that Luhmann has with the Greek tradition and its fascination for borders, hierarchies, and classifications. It seems as if for Luhmann clear distinctions were indispensable to prevent things from becoming confused with one another. More importantly, the existence of a well-defined form, of functional differentiation in the Global North, depends on the existence of a planet of slums."
