        "text": "Niklas Luhmann was a German sociologist and systems theorist, who is considered one of the most influential social scientists of the 20th century. He developed a unique theoretical framework that focused on the self-referential communication systems of modern society, which he called \"social systems theory.\"\n\nLuhmann's slip box method was a system of note-taking and organization that he used to write his numerous books and articles. He kept a large collection of index cards, each with a single idea or concept, and organized them into various categories using a complex numbering system. This allowed him to easily retrieve and connect ideas as he wrote, creating a networked structure of knowledge that reflected his complex theoretical framework. The slip box method is often cited as an example of efficient and effective note-taking for researchers and writers."
