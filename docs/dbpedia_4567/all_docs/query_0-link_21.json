        "text": "Mathieu Deflem\n\nGoogle Scholar | ResearchGate | ORCID\n\nThis is a copy of a book review in American Journal of Sociology, March 2003.\n\nAlso in PDF format.\n\nPlease cite as: Deflem, Mathieu. 2003. Review of 'Theories of Distinction: Redescribing the Descriptions of Modernity,' by Niklas Luhmann. American Journal of Sociology 108(5):1168-1170.\n\nThis collection of selected writings by the German social theorist Niklas Luhmann is one of now several in a series published by Stanford University Press. This volume is not a translation of a German original published during Luhmann's lifetime (Luhmann died on November 6, 1998). Instead it is a collection brought together by the editor, William Rasch, around the themes of modernity, observation, and communication. Rasch introduces the volume in a very dense and philosophical introduction that contemplates epistemological questions in Luhmann's oeuvre. It concludes by suggesting the Weberian rationality model as Luhmann's unacknowledged guide, although Luhmann himself explicitly rejected a comparison of his work to Weber's."
