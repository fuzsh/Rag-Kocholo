Bowen Turbotester

The Bowen Turbotester is a pre-pilot scale liquid hot water pretreatment reactor that is operable in batch mode. The system successfully pretreats maple, poplar, switchgrass, corn stover, bagasse, distillers' grains, beer solids, and silage at slurries between 15-45% solids. LORRE researchers collaborated with three companies, Celsys, Bowen Engineering, and Mascoma Corporation, in the design and fabrication of the turbotester.
