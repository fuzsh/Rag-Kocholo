This document is the November 2019 issue of Data Streak, a monthly digest on data-related topics. The main article discusses how to prepare for career transitions in data science roles. It identifies four key reasons why candidates may be rejected: lack of Python skills for data science work, lack of SQL knowledge, lack of review of supplemental career content, and lack of probability and statistics fundamentals. It provides tips in each area to strengthen applications, such as becoming proficient in pandas and scikit-learn libraries, learning SQL, reviewing interview questions and answers, and practicing Bayesian probability problems.",
