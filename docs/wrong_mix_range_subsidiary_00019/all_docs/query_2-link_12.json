The system successfully pretreats maple, poplar, switchgrass, corn stover, bagasse, distillers' grains, beer solids, and silage at slurries between 15-45% solids. LORRE researchers collaborated with three companies, Celsys, Bowen Engineering, and Mascoma Corporation, in the design and fabrication of the turbotester."
