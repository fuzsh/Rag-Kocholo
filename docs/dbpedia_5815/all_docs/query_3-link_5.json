        "text": "17 Again is a new musical based on the popular 2009 film starring Zac Efron and Matthew Perry, with music and lyrics by the Broadway team of Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner (First Date) and a book by Marco Pennette (Ugly Betty, Mom). This heartfelt musical comedy appeals to multiple generations and explores how the choices we make impact our life in unexpected ways.\n\nMike O'Donnell is a married 35-year-old man who fears his best days have passed him by. A former high-school basketball star with a bright future, Mike's life did not go as he intended. Now, Mike's marriage has failed, his kids think he's a loser, and his job is going nowhere. He gets a chance to relive his past and change his life when he is miraculously transformed back into his teenage self. But in trying to rediscover his past, Mike may be jeopardizing his future. Over the course of Mike O’Donnell’s extraordinary journey, his “do-over” of his youth leads him to a deep appreciation for the path he chose and the profound beauty to be found in his role as father and husband.\n\n17 Again’s universal themes and “Anytown, USA” setting offers the chance for a rich and diverse cast. The score is heavily influenced by pop/rock artists mashed up with musical theatre. It’s written in a style that merges contemporary sounds you’d stream on Spotify with character and story-based songs that every audience member can connect with."
