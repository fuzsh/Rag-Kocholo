As provided in Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40, Section 57, an application for a license or permit, or the renewal or transfer thereof, may be denied, revoked or suspended by any licensing authority of the Town if the person, corporation or business enterprise seeking such application, renewal or transfer has neglected or refused to pay any local taxes, fees, assessments, betterments or any other municipal charges. 2. The Collector of Taxes and any other Town official responsible for collecting a municipal fee or charge, hereinafter referred to as Town Official, shall annually furnish to the licensing authorities of the Town a list of any person, corporation, or business enterprise, hereinafter referred to as the party, that has neglected or refused to pay any local taxes, fees, assessments, betterments or other municipal charges for not less than a (12) month period except those parties who have filed in good faith a pending application for an abatement of such tax or a pending petition before the appellate tax board. 3. The licensing authority may deny, revoke or suspend any license or permit including renewals and transfers of any party whose name appears on said list furnished by the Town Official; provided however, that written notice is given to the party and the Town Official supplying a list, and the party is given a hearing to be held not earlier than fourteen (14) days after said notice. Said list shall be prima facie evidence for denial, revocation or suspension of said license or permit to any party. The Town Official shall have the right to intervene in any hearing conducted with respect to such license denial, revocation or suspension. Anv findings made by the licensing authority with respect to such license denial, revocation or 18 REPORT OF THE TOWN CLERK suspension shall be made only for the purposes of such proceeding and shall not be relevant to or introduced in any other proceeding at law, except for any appeal from such licensing denial, revocation or suspension.

Any party shall be given an opportunity to enter into a payment agreement, thereby allowing the licensing authority to issue a certificate indicating said limitations to the license or permit and the validity of said license shall be conditioned upon the satisfactory compliance with said agreement.

The Board of Selectmen may waive such denial, suspension or revocation if it finds there is no direct or indirect interest by the property owner, its officers or stockholders, if any, or members of his immediate family, as defined in Massachusetts General Law Section One of Chapter Two hundred and sixty-eight, in the business or activity conducted in or on said property. 6.

ARTICLE 12. To see if the Town will vote to amend Section 1630 of the Norwood Zoning Bylaw - Alteration or Extension of Nonconforming Structures - by deleting in its entirety the existing Section 1630 and substituting in its place a new Section 1630 which reads as follows, or act in relation thereto: PURPOSE: Under existing zoning, any alteration or extension to a nonconforming structure requires a Special Permit from the Board of Appeals. However, there are times when a proposed alteration or extension conforms in every way with the zoning regulations. In situations like this, the Board of Appeals is required to hold a Public Hearing and then must decide that the proposed change is not substantially more detrimental than the existing condition. Massachusetts General Law allows communities to exempt these types of additions or extensions from the Special Permit process. This amendment would allow \"by right\" alterations and extensions that do not intensify any existing nonconformity or result in any. additional nonconformity. EXISTING: 1630. Alteration or Extension [16B] Any nonconforming structure or use may be structurally altered or extended provided that the Board of Appeals grants a special permit, upon its determination that such alteration or extension is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing condition. PROPOSED: 1630. Alteration or Extension [16B] A nonconforming structure or use, other than a nonconforming single-family or two-family residential structure, may be structurally altered or extended provided that the Board of Appeals grants a special permit, upon its determination that such alteration or extension is not substantially 19 TOWN OF NORWOOD more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing condition. The alteration, extension or structural change (collectively \"alteration\") to a nonconforming single¬ family or two-family residential structure shall not be considered an increase in the non-conforming nature of the structure and shall be permitted by right under the following circumstances: 1. Alteration to a nonconforming structure within the existing footprint of said structure provided the alteration will comply with all applicable sections of the zoning bylaw in effect at the time of application, including front setback, minimum side and rear yard requirements, maximum lot coverage, minimum open space, and height requirements. 2. Alteration to a nonconforming structure in any other direction provided the alteration will comply with all applicable sections of the zoning bylaw in effect at the time of application, including front setback, minimum side and rear yard requirements, maximum lot coverage, and minimum open space and height requirements. 3. In cases where an alteration increases an existing nonconformity in a single-family or two-family residential structure, the Board of Appeals may grant a special permit upon its determination that such alteration or extension is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing condition. (On petition of the Planning Board) ARTICLE 13. To see if the Town will vote to amend Section 5245(d) - Secondary Signs in Business and Office Districts not having frontage on Route One - by deleting the existing Section 5245(d) in its entirety and substituting in its place a new Section 5245(d) which reads as follows, or act in relation thereto. PURPOSE: This bylaw amendment will correct a flaw in the Sign Bylaw which prohibits secondary wall signs in the Downtown Area, and in other business and office premises not located along Route One. The current bylaw runs counter to one of the purposes of the Sign Bylaw which is to facilitate efficient communications. The amended bylaw will ensure that people are able to receive the messages they need or want. EXISTING: 5245(d) Secondary Signs. Secondary signs are not permitted. PURPOSED: 5245(d) Secondary signs. There may be up to two secondary wall signs on a lot, each relating to a separate building, entrance, or frontage on a street or a parking area. Each such sign may have area of up to one (1) square foot for each foot of length of that separate occupant's leased or owned portion of the facade to which it is affixed, except that in no event shall any secondary sign exceed fifteen (15) square feet.

PURPOSE: The purpose of these amendments is to provide for special permits authorizing the 20 REPORT OF THE TOWN CLERK establishment of adult bookstores, adult motion picture theaters, adult dance clubs, and adult video stores in the Highway Business District (HB) along Route 1 . These amendments will designate the HB District as the only allowable location for adult uses, will establish the decision criteria to be used by the Special Permit Granting Authority, and will set specific setbacks and distances an adult use must be from residential districts or from another adult use. 1.)
