Students can now conduct their own experiments, fostering a deeper connection to science beyond classroom lectures. S K Raghuram and Mohnish Shukla spearheaded this initiative, driven by Infineum’s commitment to deliver a positive impact in the communities that we operate. The project not only meets legal corporate social responsibility requirements but also reflects a genuine desire to make a difference to communities in need.

Our team of 25 colleagues, friends and family joined over 32,000 participants, showcasing our commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and support for the LGBTQ+ community. The Pride in London parade is a vibrant event that brings together over 32,000 participants, including 500 groups representing various LGBTQ+ Community Groups, businesses, and partners. Our team was part of this colourful procession, led by the Mayor of London, that weaved its way from Hyde Park Corner, through iconic landmarks like Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square, and culminated at Whitehall Place. Our participation in the Pride in London parade is a testament to our dedication to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone feels accepted and valued. By standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the LGBTQ+ community, we not only celebrate their resilience, courage, and contributions but also reaffirm our commitment to championing diversity, equity, and inclusion within our organisation and beyond. #PrideInLondon #InfineumPride #Diversity #Equity #Inclusion #WeAreEverywhere\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce the publication of our 2023 Sustainability Report!

The collaboration with Earth Trust will also provide invaluable insights into how we can adapt our operations to protect and restore nature, aligning with our sustainability ambitions. The Earth Trust charity cares for 500 hectares of diverse landscapes, including woodland, farmland, wildflower meadows, and wetlands. These green spaces are open to the public so that everyone can connect with nature and explore how nature-based solutions can address climate, biodiversity, and health challenges. Earth Trust’s impactful work includes: Community Access: Supporting disadvantaged communities in accessing green spaces. Nature Education: Engaging children with the natural world around them. Wetland Restoration: Reintroducing wetlands along the Thames, contributing to evidence-based climate solutions. We’re thrilled to embark on this journey with Earth Trust, and we look forward to making a positive difference together! #Sustainability #SupportingOurCommunities #CommunityEngagement Photo credit: Earth Trust"
