        "text": "In the dynamic world of law, confidence is paramount. Whether you're stepping into the courtroom, negotiating deals in the boardroom, or meeting with clients, projecting a sense of self-assurance can make all the difference. And one powerful way to boost your confidence is by mastering the art of the lawyerly look. From impeccably tailored suits to sophisticated accessories, here's how investing in your style can inspire confidence and make you feel good about yourself. https://lnkd.in/gMPkDqBK\n\n“It’s okay to interview us when we sit down in the initial meeting. As attorneys, we are used to doing the questioning,” says WBW attorney Joseph Cargile. “We’re both navigating a new relationship at the client consultation though. There are questions you need answered. You should ask them.” Cargile suggests five basic questions to ask an attorney before deciding they are “the one” for you. #1: What experience do you have with this type of case? #2: What is your strategy for my case? #3: What are my possible outcomes? #4: What’s my role in the case? #5: How much is this going to cost? Call WBW at 229-226-2161 to begin your selection process with a free, no-obligation consultation.\n\n\"Pit bull\" attorneys have a time and place (mostly in movies) — not in representing you or your business. Aggressive attorneys can often inflame an already tense situation and drag out costs and time spent in court. Instead of searching for an attorney with those qualities, look for an attorney who wants to solve problems and secure the best possible outcome for you. Your attorney should hit a few (if not all) of these boxes: ✅ Forward-thinking: Motivated by what's in your best interest and can provide actionable steps on how to solve issues. ✅ Communicative: Can tell you the hard truths and logically guide you forward. ✅ Zealous Advocate: Shows up present, ready to take action and deliver results. ✅ Confident: Can put their ego aside and show professionalism and assertiveness in the courtroom and with others.

Are you thoughtful about the cases you turn down? Share your experience in the comments below.\n\nI am frequently asked, \"What is the most critical aspect of trial?\" My answer surprises many people because I don't identify a phase of the trial. Instead, I answer, \"The attorney must be honest and credible. Honesty and credibility is the only thing an attorney has when he or she stands before the jury.\" Juries want an honest guide in the courtroom. We know the rules and the procedures - the jurors don't. We are like salespersons in the courtroom, selling our client's case to the jury. Would you buy anything from someone you don't trust? Your jury won't either. If the jury feels you are not honest, or you lack credibility, or you are not following the rules, or worst of all, you are mean, you will never win. juryattorney.com\n\nSelf-deprecation is part of taking a deposition. We tell the witness at the opening that our questions may not be perfect. If the witness gets confused, we are quick to say \"that was poorly worded. Let me try it a different way.\" Of course there are exceptions. But generally speaking we get one chance to depose each witness. We want them to answer the questions. We want them to feel comfortable revealing information. We do not want them to fight with us and make the job more difficult. From the other side, when defending a deposition we want our clients to keep up their guard. Be truthful, but don't be considered. Think hard before you agree. Remember, the other attorney is there with a job, not to be your friend."
