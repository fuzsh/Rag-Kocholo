        "text": "The surname Abbondanza was first found in Venice (Italian: Venezia), and seaport occupying one of the most remarkable sites of the world. Centralizing on the Grand Canal the history of the city can be traced through the different styles of architecture Byzantine, Gothic, early Renaissance and late Renaissance. It is rich in ancient palaces, churches, libraries, galleries, monuments, statues, treasures and artifacts. Its history is abundant in politics, art, religion, scholarship and conflict. The ducal palace was commenced in 1309. In those ancient times only persons of rank, the podesta, clergy, city officials, army officers, artists, landowners were entered into the records. To be recorded at this time, at the beginning of recorded history, was of itself a great distinction and indicative of noble ancestry.\n\nEarly History of the Abbondanza family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Abbondanza research. Another 162 words (12 lines of text) covering the year 1227 is included under the topic Early Abbondanza History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nAbbondanza Spelling Variations\n\nItalian surnames come in far more variations than the names of most other nationalities. Regional traditions and dialects are a decisive factor in this characteristic. For example, northern names tend to end in \"o\", while southern in \"i\". Also important, but not unique to Italy, was the fact that before dictionaries and the printing press most scribes simply spelled words according to their sounds. The predictable result was an enormous number of spelling variations. The recorded spellings of Abbondanza include Abenante, Abbanento, Abbenanti, Abbenante, Abbondanti, Abbondanza and many more."
