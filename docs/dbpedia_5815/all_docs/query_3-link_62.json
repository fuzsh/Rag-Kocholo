        "text": "Introduction\n\nGenomic DNA is under constant assault from various damaging agents, leading to breaks and chemical modifications such as oxidation. Among the oxidized base adducts that have been identified [1, 2], 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), is the most abundant, since guanine, out of the four bases, has the lowest redox potential [3]. Oxidation of G to 8-oxo-dG can occur both directly in the DNA or in the free nucleotide pool by several processes, including the formation of hydroxyl radicals derived from endogenous reactive oxygen species [4], as well as exogenous sources like ionizing radiation [5], and incorporated into the DNA by several polymerases [6]. Its most pivotal characteristic is its ability to both pair with cytosine (forming a regular Watson-Crick base pair) and adenine (forming a Hoogsteen base pair). 8-oxo-dG, when paired with cytosine, is proactively excised from the DNA in humans by the DNA glycosylases OGG1 [7], and adenine, when paired with 8-oxo-dG, is excised by MUTYH [8], but also via preemptive sanitisation of the nucleotide pool by MTH1 (also known as NUDT1) [9]. However, upon failure to repair a 8-oxo-dG:C pair prior to replication, it can lead to a 8-oxo-dG:A pair, which upon a second round of replication would become T:A, leading to a C>A transversion [10, 11]If 8-oxo-dG is incorporated from the nucleotide pool opposite of adenine, then a T>G transversion can also occur after replication [12].Mutations downstream of 8-oxo-dG have significant implications in the development of cancer [13, 14, 15]. 8-oxo-dG is the proposed mechanism underlying COSMIC [16] signatures 18 and 36 [17, 18, 19], and has been recognized as a potential disease biomarker in the field [20, 21]. 8-oxo-dG has also been linked to transcriptional and epigenetic regulation [22], in particular in the context of DNA (de)methylation at cytosine (5-methylcytosine, 5-mC): 8-oxo-dG passively inhibits methyltransferases [23], and OGG1 recruits TET enzymes which convert 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) as the first step in the demethylation process [24].\n\nDue to its potential as a disease biomarker, several efforts have been made to quantify 8-oxo-dG in urine [25, 26], blood [27], genomic material [28], and several other tissues [21]. The absolute quantification of 8-oxo-dG has predominantly relied on highly sensitive methods such as liquid or gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry or electrochemical detection, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [21]. However, its accuracy has been subject to debate due to large discrepancies between reported levels [29, 30, 31, 21], and high variability between laboratories [32]. Furthermore, these methods fail to provide insights into the genomic location of 8-oxo-dG, which precludes unveiling the mechanisms underlying heterogeneous mutation rates, repair mechanisms, and the role of 8-oxo-dG in epigenetic regulation. For this reason, recently several innovative genomics-based methods have attempted to investigate 8-oxo-dG in a genome-wide manner. These approaches include the detection of apurinic sites created by 8-oxo-dG repair enzymes (Click-code-seq [33] and OGG1-AP-seq [34]), ChIP-seq techniques employing an 8-oxo-dG antibody (OxiDIP-seq [35]), pull-down of cross-linked biotin tags attached to 8-oxo-dG (OG-seq [36] and CLAPS-seq [37]), and pull-down of 8-oxo-dG repair enzymes (enTRAP-seq [38]). Collectively, these methods have revealed that 8-oxo-dG, and its repair, is not uniformly distributed throughout the genome, although with some contradictory results between the methods [39, 22]. Current genomic approaches have three main downsides: first, they lack single nucleotide resolution (with the exception of Click-code-seq), which hampers the study of the relationship between 8-oxo-dG and its associated mutational signatures; secondly, these methods rely on short-read sequencing methods and therefore cannot properly investigate genomic repetitive regions; and lastly, indirect detection is associated frequently with false positive (FP) signals due to suboptimal antibody specificity, enzymatic or chemical reactivity [39]. The latter is especially important given the reported rarity of 8-oxo-dG (1-100 8-oxo-dG per 1 million G [21]). For example, even with a usually considered low false positive rate (FPR) of 1%, the ratio between false and true positives would be approximately 10:1, which would quickly obfuscate any real signal and preclude meaningful conclusions [40].\n\nNanopore sequencing operates by threading a DNA (or RNA) molecule through a membrane-embedded pore while measuring fluctuations in the electrical current over the membrane, and is currently commercialized by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [41]. Changes in the electrical current are indicative of the molecule’s chemical properties, which holds the potential to detect base modifications. This enabled the detection of 5-mC using α-Hemolysin pores [42], and later using ONT devices [43, 44]. Since then, base modification detection models have been developed both by ONT and the community for detecting both naturally occurring and synthetic modifications [45]. But so far, there is no model available for the detection of 8-oxo-dG by nanopore sequencing. Developing modification detection models presents substantial challenges, especially for rare modifications. Firstly, obtaining sequencing data where the precise location of a rare modification is known is not trivial, as these modifications cannot be verified with other technologies to establish a ground truth. Moreover, the context of the modification must exhibit sufficient diversity to prevent the model from learning sequence biases. The effect of the modification passing through the pore on the electrical current must be pronounced enough to distinguish it from inherent noise and other bases. And finally, the model must be extremely precise to accommodate detection of rare modifications, e.g. while for 5-mC it is acceptable to have a 1% FPR, it would be prohibitively high for rare modifications such as 8-oxo-dG due to its low abundance [40].\n\nKeeping these considerations in mind, we devised an approach to generate a library of long synthetic DNA molecules that each contain 8-oxo-dG in a known, specific, but variable sequence context. Utilizing this ground truth dataset, we demonstrate that 8-oxo-dG has a discernible impact on the nanopore raw signal, leading to systematic errors using the ONT provided basecaller. We trained a deep learning model capable of detecting 8-oxo-dG from the raw signal with single-nucleotide resolution, high specificity, and employed it in a cell line with inducible, localized oxidative stress in the nucleus. Our experiments show genome wide variability in 8-oxo-dG levels, with increased levels in complex and repetitive regions which were uncharted by previous short-read based methods. For the first time, we are able to simultaneously measure 5-mC and 8-oxo-dG at single molecule resolution, revealing a strong 5-mC depletion within a 2-kilobase window surrounding 8-oxo-dG. Collectively, our approach showcases a methodology widely applicable to any synthesizable DNA base modification.\n\n8-oxo-dG is detectable using nanopore sequencing\n\nTo generate a ground truth dataset, we designed a set of 110 short synthetic oligos (46 base pairs each) that contained 8-oxo-dG in different genomic contexts. The oligo design (Figure 1a) consists of three barcodes (7 base pairs each) to enable multiplexing. In addition, these barcodes have been optimized to facilitate signal segmentation. The oligos were designed to contain complementary overhangs (10 base pairs) enabling concatenation via hybridization and ligation to create long reads that can efficiently be sequenced on the nanopore platform (Methods, oligo design). The 8-oxo-dG base is surrounded by two predefined bases on either side (K1, K2, K3, K4), and five additional random bases (2 bases on the 5’ end (N1, N2), and 3 bases on the 3’ end (N3, N4, N5)) to ensure context diversity. We decided to use predefined bases next to the 8-oxo-dG base, instead of random bases, because the effect of the modification would make it impossible to accurately determine which true bases corresponded to each oligo (Figure 1b). Knowing the true sequence of an oligo is necessary to train a basecaller. Finally the oligos include an unmodified guanine base surrounded by the same bases as the 8-oxo-dG base to serve as a built-in control (Figure 1a, Supplementary table 1).\n\nUsing the concatenated synthetic oligos, we first established whether 8-oxo-dG has an effect on the basecalling performance of ONT’s standard base calling model. We found that there was a substantial increase in basecalling errors specifically at the site of 8-oxo-dG (not basecalling 8-oxo-dG as G) and its neighboring bases (Figure 1b). The basecaller’s most likely mistakes, regarding 8-oxo-dG, are deletions (16.4%) or incorrect calls as cytosine (13.5%) or adenine (12.5%) (Supplementary figure 1). Moreover, the basecalling error rate is not uniform across different contexts, varying from 1.4% to 91% (Supplementary table 2). This variability suggests that the signal alterations are 5-mer context dependent. To establish that the increased error rate was not an artifact of our oligo generated data, we also assessed the error rate on the reverse strand, which is devoid of any modified bases. As expected, here we did observe a consistently low error rate, which was much more uniformly distributed across the different bases and contexts (Supplementary figure 2). Interestingly, the cytosine opposite to the 8-oxo-dG base exhibited a slightly higher error rate (median 12.3%) compared to the other bases (median 5.0%) (Supplementary table 3). Note that the DNA is unwound when it enters the pore, and hence this cytosine is no longer bound to 8-oxo-dG when it is being sequenced. We hypothesized that the unwinding of the DNA by the helicase might be affected by 8-oxo-dG. We therefore compared the speed (based on raw to expected signal alignment) between cytosines paired to 8-oxo-dG and cytosines paired to G in the same 5-mer contexts. We observed that on average cytosines paired to 8-oxo-dG had fewer measurements, suggesting faster translocation of the DNA, than cytosines paired to G (77% of evaluated 5-mers) (Supplementary figure 3). This suggests that, despite only sequencing one DNA strand, the opposite strand can have an impact on translocation speed via structural effects that impact the proteins in the pore, thus affecting base calling accuracy.\n\nWe then evaluated what specific effect 8-oxo-dG has on the raw signal. To this end, we aligned the measured raw signal to the expected signal (obtained from ONT’s k-mer model) based on the known underlying sequence (Methods, Raw data alignment, Supplementary note 1). We observed a significant difference between the expected (which assumes an unmodified guanine) and measured signals. For example, in Figure 1c it can be seen that the measured signal is higher than expected when 8-oxo-dG is present. This effect is also clear when evaluating other sequence contexts (Figure 1d), indicating that 8-oxo-dG has a clear effect on the measured signal. The measured signal is also significantly different from the other 3 bases (A, C and T) (Supplementary figure 4, Supplementary figure 5) and is most dissimilar to the pyrimidines. Considering these observations, we concluded that 8-oxo-dG is discernible from the other four canonical bases, suggesting that training a machine learning algorithm for its detection would be feasible.\n\nBonito basecaller fine-tuning\n\nThe nanopore signal originating from 8-oxo-dG containing sequences appears to have several context dependent distinctive features. We therefore sought to train a neural network model that could distinguish 8-oxo-dG from G. We opted for a two step approach, similar to ONT’s Bonito + Remora combination (Figure 2a). First, Bonito performs regular basecalling (A, C, G, T); and afterwards, Remora classifies the base of interest (e.g. C vs 5-mC, or in our case G vs 8-oxo-dG) as modified or not, using a small data window (e.g. 100 data points).\n\nSince we already observed that the basecaller provided by ONT is not 8-oxo-dG aware, (Figure 2b), we first fine-tuned a Bonito model to basecall 8-oxo-dG as G. To that end, we used a publicly available pre-trained version of Bonito from ONT, and fine-tuned it by training it with oligo concatemers containing 8-oxo-dG and publicly available human data from the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) reference dataset (Methods, Genomic DNA: Telomere-to-telomere). We also fine-tuned a model with only data from the T2T dataset to assess the effect of fine-tuning itself on basecalling performance. We then evaluated the basecalling performance of these models on human genomic data, and their capacity to basecall 8-oxo-dG as G, in a cross-validated manner (Methods, Base calling cross-validation). We observed that after fine-tuning the models with oligo data, 8-oxo-dG was basecalled as G (∼3% median error rate), and immediate neighboring bases are basecalled correctly at error rates similar to the rest of the bases (Figure 2b, Supplementary figure 6). To ensure that the model did not overfit to the oligo data, we also evaluated the basecalling performance on human genomic data. We observed that basecalling was slightly more accurate on the fine-tuned model than on the pre-trained model (median error rate decreased from 14% to 10%); and that the addition of oligo data in the training did not have a negative effect on regular genomic basecalling (Figure 2c). Our Bonito fine-tuned model can now accurately basecall 8-oxo-dG as G, and is also capable of regular genomic basecalling.\n\nDetecting 8-oxo-dG with high specificity\n\nWe then trained a Remora-like model to distinguish 8-oxo-dG from unmodified guanine. We started by training a base model which takes as input both 100 data points of signal and the basecalled 7-mer. Both features were centered around the guanine of interest. The model then outputs a score between zero and one for the likeliness of that particular guanine being 8-oxo-dG (Supplementary figure 7). We trained the model on both positive and negative examples of 8-oxo-dG from our synthetic oligo dataset, as well as on T2T data (Methods, Modification calling cross-validation, Remora training). This initial model achieved 93.3% accuracy and 94% specificity at the 0.5 score threshold, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 (Figure 3a). This level of performance is comparable to state-of-the-art 5-mC calling [46]. Problematically, 8-oxo-dG is not as prevalent as 5-mC, and requires a model with near perfect specificity to ensure reasonable FDRs (Supplementary table 4). For example, assuming 1-100 8-oxo-dG per million guanines [21], the base model (specificity of 98.6% at the 0.9 score threshold), would be making 100-10000 false positive (FP) calls per true positive call, thus obscuring any real signal. Ideally, we would have a specificity of at least an order of magnitude lower than the prevalence of 8-oxo-dG (Q50-Q70, i.e. 1 false positive per 0.1-10 million guanine calls; (Methods, Specificity Q-Scoring notation)). We subsequently explored whether candidate filtering based on basecall errors, or metric learning approaches would improve performance, but we did not observe any major improvements (Supplementary note 2).\n\nTo further improve the specificity of our Remora-like model, we explored the use of class weights during training to emphasize the importance of true negatives (TN). For this purpose, we trained two additional models in which the positive class (8-oxo-dG) had a weight of 10% or 1%, relative to the negative class (G). Using a lower weight on the positive class had a negative impact on global performance, as the AUC was reduced to 0.96 and 0.92, respectively (Figure 3a). However, it increased specificity from Q12 to Q27 when using the 0.5 cutoff; and is further increased from Q20 to Q38 when using the more stringent 0.95 cutoff. However, the true positive rates (TPR) decreased from 88% to 56%, and from 66% to only 38% respectively (Figure 3b). These results indicate that reducing the weight of the positive class leads to a significant increase in specificity at the cost of an increase of false negatives.\n\nWe finally explored if additional signal and sequence features could improve model performance. For example, a signal feature would be the expected signal given the basecalled sequence, and a sequence feature would be the base calling quality scores (Methods Remora feature-engineering). We evaluated these features in a feature expansion experiment in which we sequentially added one additional feature at a time. We trained these models with a 1% weight on positive samples since our objective was to further reduce the FPR. Our results indicate that, after adding the expected signal as a feature, the specificity increased from Q38 to Q47 with only a mild 5% reduction of the TPR. Adding additional features, such as the difference between measured and expected signal, and the phred quality scores further increased specificity (to Q48) but with a TPR reduction from 40% to 20% (Figure 3c, red). We then added the same features, but based on the pre-trained Bonito base calling model, since its base calls would differ mostly if an 8-oxo-dG was involved. By adding the pre-trained model basecalls and expected signal, the TPR increased by 3%, but did not achieve any specificity improvements (Figure 3c, purple). We finally added the difference between the features of the fine-tuned and pre-trained models. These models had similar performance (specificity Q47) and the TPR was at similar levels as the previous models (21%) (Figure 3c, blue). Models which contained the expected signal achieved significantly worse TPRs, and we observed that these models greatly overfit during training (Supplementary figure 9). We hypothesize that some of these features are predictive but easy to overfit to. For example, just by using the difference of expected signal based on the basecalls from the two models, one can achieve an AUC of 0.79 (Supplementary figure 10). In conclusion, the largest improvement was derived by adding the expected signal based on the basecalled sequence as it increased specificity the most without compromising the TPR too much, which also holds true for the less stringent threshold of 0.5 (Supplementary figure 11).\n\nOur models have demonstrated an FPR within the same order of magnitude as the expected 8-oxo-dG levels. However, we hypothesized that this error may not be distributed uniformly across the different k-mers, and some k-mers might have an increased FPR. We decided to use k=5 since it is the maximum number of bases with a known reference around 8-oxo-dG in our oligo data. Indeed, four 5-mers demonstrated an AUC of approximately 0.5, equivalent to random guessing. In contrast, 73 other 5-mers exhibited an AUC exceeding 0.9, with the remaining 5-mers falling in between (Supplementary figure 12). We also observed that there is a large spread in terms of specificity, ranging from Q24 to Q56 (median Q47) (Figure 3d). Notably, for some 5-mers (58 out of 110, indicated in red in Figure 3d), we did not detect any false positives, and we calculated their specificity as a single false positive pseudocount. We also observe that the performance spread is also large in terms of sensitivity (average 0.33 ± 0.22 s.d.), meaning that on average, one out of three 8-oxo-dG molecules will be detected. Because of the low abundance of 8-oxo-dG, we decided to only consider 5-mers that reached a minimum specificity of Q40 (87 out of 110) for subsequent analysis to ensure that the signal to noise ratio is maximized, which corresponds to ∼35% of the guanines in the human genome.\n\nH2O2 production close to the DNA increases 8-oxo-dG levels\n\nUsing our nanopore based 8-oxo-dG modification caller, we sought to explore 8-oxo-dG’s locations genome-wide, including repetitive regions previously unexplored by short-read sequencing techniques. To this end we used hTert-immortalized RPE1 cells that express D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) from R. gracilis as a fusion with Histone H2B (RPE1-hTERT-DAAOH2B). Upon administration of D-Alanine (D-Ala), DAAO produces H2O2 in the vicinity of DNA, given its fusion to H2B. Exposure to D-Ala has been shown to give rise to C>A mutations in this mode (in a p53 KO background), suggesting that DAAOH2B activation leads to formation of 8-oxo-dG in the genome [47]. RPE1-hTERT-DAAOH2B cells were exposed to a 2 hour pulse of 20 mM D-Ala, after which we harvested and sequenced the DNA and analyzed it using our 8-oxo-dG model (Methods, Cell line sequencing).\n\nWe observed that H2O2 production at the chromatin resulted, somewhat unexpectedly, only in a modest increase of 12 additional detected 8-oxo-dG modifications per a million guanines (16% increase, p-value=0.016) as compared to control (Figure 4a). We noted that RPE1-hTERT-DAAOH2B p53-/- cells had overall higher levels of 8-oxo-dG already in control treated cells, compared to RPE1-hTERT-DAAOH2B p53 wild-type, suggesting that the loss of p53 leads to general higher levels of 8-oxo-dG, either by enhanced oxidative stress or slower removal of the modification. After induction of H2O2 production, both p53-/- and wild-type cells reach similar total 8-oxo-dG levels (Supplementary figure 13). We correlated 8-oxo-dG levels to GC content in 1kb bins (Figure 4b). We observed that GC content was highly correlated with 8-oxo-dG levels in all conditions (Supplementary figure 14). Although this might be expected, we noticed that the rate between 8-oxo-dG and GC content changed at approximately 50%. This indicates that high GC content regions get more easily oxidized, or less effectively repaired, based on the rates measured at lower GC content regions (Supplementary figure 15). We next evaluated whether 8-oxo-dG levels were depleted or enriched in specific regions in the genome (Figure 4c). Overall, we observed differences in 8-oxo-dG levels depending on the DNA strand (Supplementary figure 16) and the chromosomal arm (Supplementary figure 17). The forward strands of chromosomes 5, 18 and 19 (p-arms) and chromosomes 1 and 19 (q-arms) have a significant (p-value<0.05) 14% or more 8-oxo-dG compared to their reverse strand counterparts, and the reverse strands of chromosomes 12, 14, 15 (p-arms) and chromosome 16 (q-arm) have 9% or more 8-oxo-dG compared to their forward strand counterpart. These particular differences are treatment and p53 status independent (Supplementary figure 18, Supplementary figure 19, Supplementary figure 20, Supplementary figure 21). We then analyzed the relative 8-oxo-dG levels across different genomic regions (Figure 4d). Again, we observed a global increase in 8-oxo-dG levels after H2O2 production, irrespective of genomic region (Supplementary figure 22). Non-repetitive and centromeric genomic regions showed 8-oxo-dG levels that roughly align with the overall rate of ∼80 8-oxo-dG per 1 million G (Figure 4d, gray dashed line); with the exception of the 5’-UTR, which has the highest median levels, as also previously reported by Ding et al [36]. On the other hand, complex repetitive and satellite regions contained, relatively, the most 8-oxo-dG with high variance between chromosomes (Figure 4d). We fitted a linear model to evaluate whether 5-mer content, or the relative abundance of the different genomic regions, were causative for these observations, however none could explain the observed variability (Supplementary note 3).\n\nFinally, we evaluated 8-oxo-dG at telomeric regions since they are guanine rich, and their oxidation has been linked to senescence and telomere shortening [48, 49]. To that end, we combined the sequencing data from all experimental conditions, and obtained a total of 487 reads that primarily mapped to the telomeres. We observed a strong bias towards reads mapping on the p-arm reverse strand and q-arm forward strand (Supplementary figure 23); which can be explained by blunt end requirement of the ligation mechanism in the library preparation (Supplementary note 4). Notably, we only detected 2 high confidence 8-oxo-dG calls on the q-arm telomeres of chromosomes 16 and 19 (Supplementary figure 24), a value ten times lower than expected, given the 50% GC content of the region. This result might indicate that 8-oxo-dG is very efficiently repaired at telomeres as a preventive measure to downstream complications.\n\nThe 8-oxo-dG trinucleotide context profile does not match the C>A mutational signatures\n\nBecause of its ability to mispair with A, unrepaired 8-oxo-dG present at the time of DNA replication, oxidative stress has been the proposed mechanism behind the COSMIC mutational signatures 18 and 36 [17, 18, 19]. We therefore wanted to compare C:G>A:T (here mentioned solely as C>A) mutations to the derived 8-oxo-dG profile to establish if the resulting mutations had the same trinucleotide context as the detected 8-oxo-dG. Using the same RPE1-hTERT-DAAOH2B-p53-/- cell lines, van Soest et al. [47] performed Illumina sequencing to analyze the mutational profile caused by H2B-DAAO-derived H2O2. This analysis was also performed in a p53 WT background in a parallel experiment not shown in van Soest et al. [47]. We therefore used these mutational profiles and compared them to the 8-oxo-dG profile. It must be noted that the mutational profiles were obtained after 4 rounds of 20mM D-Ala treatment and recovery; while for our 8-oxo-dG analysis, we did a single 20mM D-Ala pulse followed by immediate DNA harvesting. We therefore abstain from drawing any strong conclusions regarding the relationship between number of mutations and 8-oxo-dG due to the treatment difference.\n\nThe mutational profiles were highly similar in terms of COSMIC mutational signatures present (minimum cosine similarity of 0.95) (Supplementary figure 25), irrespective of H2O2 induction and p53 status. The only major difference between the samples was the amount of mutations [47]. Since our aim is to compare the mutational signatures, we combined the mutational profiles of all the sequenced conditions (Figure 5a). To make the mutational profile comparable to the 8-oxo-dG profile, we recalculated the mutational profile including only mutations in the 5-mer contexts in which our model performed with at least Q40 specificity, which reduced the total number of C>A variants from 6880 to 2506. We also normalized the relative contribution of each 3-mer based on the number of 5-mers that passed the specificity threshold (Supplementary figure 26). We observed that these limitations did not drastically change the originally derived mutational profile (Supplementary figure 27).\n\nWe detected many more 8-oxo-dG bases than C>A mutations in every analyzed 3-mer context despite the shorter treatment (Supplementary figure 28). The C>A mutational profile (Figure 5a) and the 8-oxo-dG profile (Figure 5b) however only moderately agree (cosine similarity of 0.33). Our results do therefore not discard the hypothesis that 8-oxo-dG is the underlying cause of C>A mutations, but rather that the rate at which 8-oxo-dG leads to a C>A mutation is 3-mer context specific. Notably, the C>A mutational profile has a high similarity (cosine similarity of 0.95) with the 3-mer abundance profile of the human genome (Supplementary figure 29) and the observed mutation profile thus seems to more closely relate to 3-mer abundance than to 8-oxo-dG location itself (Figure 5c). This suggests that C>A mutations are likely driven by other or additional mechanisms such as replication timing [50]. Interestingly, we do observe strong 8-oxo-dG enrichment and depletion for certain 3-mers (Figure 5d), in particular 3-mers that contain a CG or a GG motif. This result coincides with our previous observation of 8-oxo-dG enrichment in high GC content regions, but might hint at other mechanisms such as a relationship with CpG methylation.\n\n8-oxo-dG levels negatively correlate with methylation levels\n\nPrevious work has linked 8-oxo-dG with both inhibition of DNA methylation [23, 51], as well as active demethylation via TET enzyme recruitment by OGG1 [52, 24]. Whereas previous methods for genomic 8-oxo-dG detection precluded the simultaneous assessment of 8-oxo-dG and other base modifications, our approach can, for the first time, look at 8-oxo-dG, 5-mC and 5-hmC on the same DNA molecule. We therefore compared the methylation and hydroxymethylation status of the surrounding CpG sites between G and 8-oxo-dG containing regions in a 10 kilo-base window in the same DNA molecule.\n\nWe observed that there is a significant general decrease in methylation levels around oxidized guanines compared to non-oxidized (Figure 6a, Methods, 8-oxo-dG related methylation analysis). The decrease in methylation levels correlates with distance to the oxidized base: it is lowest close to 8-oxo-dG (∼45% methylation), and recovers to average genome-wide methylation levels at approximately 2000 base from 8-oxo-dG (∼54% methylation). This effect was observed irrespective of p53 status and DAAOH2B-derived H2O2 production, suggesting a DNA damage independent relationship (Supplementary figure 30). We then grouped the data by 3-mer analogous to the profile analysis and observed that the decrease in methylation levels correlated with the 3-mer enrichment for 8-oxo-dG (Figure 6b-c). The decrease in methylation is largest for 3-mers with a CG motif, with the exception of CGT. A decrease in methylation is also observed for 3-mers without a CG motif, this is most apparent for GGA, which has a similar decrease in methylation level as compared to CG containing 3-mers. Interestingly, in 3-mers without a CG motif the methylation levels reached average genome wide levels at approximately 1 thousand base-pairs from 8-oxo-dG, while methylation levels in 3-mers with a CG motif did not return to baseline within 5kb from 8-oxo-dG [Figure 6c]. Strangely, the AGG was the only 3-mer that displayed overall higher methylation levels for 8-oxo-dG containing molecules (Figure 6c). We observed that 5-hmC levels were slightly higher in 8-oxo-dG vs guanine containing regions (average ∼3.5% vs ∼3%) (Supplementary figure 31). Similarly to 5-mC, we did not observe p53 or H2O2 dependent effects (Supplementary figure 32). However, upon inspection of the 5-hmC levels per 3-mer, we observed that there is no difference in 5-hmC levels per 3-mer with the exception of two cases (Supplementary figure 33). First, 5-hmC levels are highest around the GGA context, reaching an average of 6% in regions containing 8-oxo-dG. And secondly, the opposite effect happens in the CGA context, where 5-hmC levels are highest for regions with G (average ∼5,8%) (Supplementary figure 33).\n\nOur approach enabled simultaneous assessment of 8-oxo-dG, 5-mC, and 5-hmC on the same DNA molecule for the first time. Together with our analysis of the mutational signatures, our results suggest that 8-oxo-dG abundance has a primary role in epigenetic regulation, and that its mutagenic effect would play a secondary role.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNanopore sequencing holds the potential to detect any base modification, both on DNA and RNA. However, due to technical challenges, accurate models have only been established for a limited number of modifications [45]. Available models focus on highly prevalent modifications, like 5-mC or 6mA because they can be generated enzymatically, are highly stable, and therefore training data can be easily obtained and verified through alternative sequencing technologies [45]. However, these approaches are not widely applicable to less abundant modified bases [53]. In this study, we leverage synthetic DNA to bridge this gap, enabling the generation of a fully controlled ground truth dataset. We show that our approach can successfully be used to detect 8-oxo-dG, and has the potential to be expanded to nanopore-based detection of other base modifications. Furthermore, compared to existing 8-oxo-dG detection methods, our approach does not require any complex sample preparation, chemical reactions or antibody pull-downs, and can be readily applied to existing nanopore data.\n\nOur work showcases that developing deep-learning models required for detecting rare modifications from the raw nanopore squiggles is not trivial. False positives drastically decrease the signal-to-noise ratio and, if not low enough, will mask any inherent biological signal [40]. We address this by using label weighting and feature engineering. However, while we achieved a major increase in specificity, this comes at the price of reduced sensitivity of the model. Rare base modifications also pose a challenge in regular base calling. As we have shown, 8-oxo-dG naive basecallers have a significantly increased error rate on molecules that contain an 8-oxo-dG modification. Therefore, until these rare modifications are integrated in the basecaller training pipelines, perfect accuracy for all natively sequenced molecules will not be achievable.\n\nUsing our highly specific model, we show differential 8-oxo-dG levels across the different chromosomes and genomic regions of RPE1-hTERT cells. Our observations fit with the variability shown in OGG1 driven apurinic sites [34]; and we also observe a similar distribution of 8-oxo-dG over non-repetitive regions as reported in Ding et al. [36]. For the first time, we can evaluate 8-oxo-dG abundance on highly repetitive sequences, which show high levels of 8-oxo-dG, indicating either increased susceptibility to oxidation or less efficient repair. Surprisingly, we observed very low 8-oxo-dG levels at the telomeres despite their oxidation susceptibility [54]. This might suggest that telomeric 8-oxo-dG is very efficiently repaired to avoid telomere shortening and the downstream induction of cellular senescence [48, 49]. However, our coverage was limited, and further research using telomere enrichment techniques [55] might advance our understanding of the repair mechanisms of 8-oxo-dG at telomeres [56].\n\nThe mutational process behind C>A mutations in COSMIC signatures 18 and 36 has been long attributed to oxidative stress and unrepaired 8-oxo-dG [17, 18, 19]. Our results show that, primarily, 8-oxo-dG does not strongly correlate with the same nucleotide context of the signatures. Rather, these signatures strongly follow the human 3-mer genomic content, which indicate that the mutational rate of 8-oxo-dG is 3-mer specific, and could be driven by other mechanisms such as replication timing [50]. Importantly, our results do not discard 8-oxo-dG as the cause of C>A mutations, since the modified base is far more abundant than the resulting mutations. Rather, we envision that these mutations are secondary to the role of 8-oxo-dG in epigenetic regulation.\n\nWe observed a distinct decrease in CpG methylation levels around 8-oxo-dG, however it is unclear whether CpG demethylation precedes guanine oxidation, or vice-versa. It has been shown that 8-oxo-dG inhibits methyl-transferase enzymes [23, 51, 52], which would indicate that oxidation happens in already de-methylated regions. Another possibility would be that active demethylation is promoted via the recruitment of TET enzymes by OGG1 [24]. At first sight, this model suggests that, 8-oxo-dG then would have been removed by OGG1, and therefore would not be detected in the first place. However, OGG1 oxidation can block its glycosylase and lyase activity, but not its binding to 8-oxo-dG [57], which would explain why we still measure 8-oxo-dG, and indicate that oxidation happens before de-methylation. Finally, some histone demethylases are known to produce H2O2 as part of the histone demethylation reaction (e.g. H3K9 [58] and H3K4 [59], which could cause the formation of multiple 8-oxo-dGs while oxidatively inhibiting the recruited OGG1. This model would link histone and DNA epigenetics through redox regulation. Perturbation experiments on OGG1, in combination with TET and histone demethylases, would provide valuable insights to further elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanism.\n\nIn conclusion, our work showcases a viable methodology for rare modification detection using nanopore sequencing, which could be applicable to detect any synthesizable base modification. These models can then be later used to decipher and further understand epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and the interplay between DNA modifications, as well as potential implications for disease mechanisms and biomarker detection.\n\nMethods\n\nOligo design\n\nA total of 110 oligos were designed in complementary pairs, wherein each forward oligo contains an 8-oxo-dG base and was paired with its complementary reverse strand oligo devoid of any base modifications. Oligos are 46 base pairs long and contain three barcodes, two 8-oxo-dG/G k-mer regions of 10 and 5 bases respectively, and a 10 base overhang. The barcodes are 7 bases long and were defined to have the lowest basecalling error rate possible (based on the T2T dataset (Methods, Genomic DNA: Telomere-to-telomere)) and a high sequence entropy (meaning that the same base was never repeated sequentially). The 10 base overhangs are complementary between the forward and reverse strands, which allow concatenation via hybridization and ligation to create long molecules that are more readily sequenced on the nanopore platform. Between the first and second barcode lies an 8-oxo-dG that is immediately surrounded by two known bases at either side, which provides the known sequence context. Similarly, between the second and third barcode a guanine is surrounded by the same four bases. To maximize sequence variability around 8-oxo-dG, five additional random bases were added: two on the 5’ end, and three on the 3’ end.\n\nOligo concatenation\n\nOligos were first annealed in a thermocycler by mixing the two complementary oligos in equimolar rates. Oligos were diluted in 1X T4 ligase buffer (NEB REF #B0202S) in a total volume of 10µL. The mixture was heated to 95°C for 5 minutes, and then the temperature was decreased by 0.1°C per second until 4°C. After hybridization, oligos were concatenated by ligation. 9µL of 1X T4 ligase buffer (NEB REF #B0202S) and 1 µL of T4 ligase (NEB REF #M0202S) were added to the solution. Afterwards, the mixture was incubated at 16°C for 18h. T4 ligase was then inactivated at 65°C for 10 min. The resulting DNA was cleaned using the Qiagen PCR & Gel Cleanup Kit (Qiagen REF #28506) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted from the column using Milli-Q water. This process was repeated 3 times to increase the concatemers length (Supplementary figure 34). Oligo concatemer concentrations were then quantified via Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000 #ND-2000) and multiplexed prior to library preparation in equimolar rates as indicated in Supplementary table 1.\n\nGenomic DNA: Telomere-to-telomere\n\nWe used existing nanopore sequencing data from the reference genome (NA12878/GM12878, Ceph/Utah pedigree) dataset [60]. This human dataset contains many different sequencing runs. We arbitrarily chose three experiments so that each different ligation kit (rapid, ligation and ultra) would be included: FAB42828, FAF09968 and FAF04090. We assumed all the sequenced DNA did not contain any 8-oxo-dG as it had been prepared using the standard library preparation protocol, which contains a repair step with Fpg, a DNA glycosylase that removes 8-oxo-dG.\n\nLibrary preparation\n\nOligo concatemers and genomic DNA samples were library prepared using the SQK-LSK109 ligation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the exception that the FFPE repair step was skipped. The exclusion of this step was deliberate and meant to preserve 8-oxo-dG in our samples since the enzymatic function of Fpg as a DNA glycosylase is responsible for removing 8-oxo-dG from DNA.\n\nNanopore sequencing\n\nSamples were sequenced using MinION R9.4.1 flow cells for 72h using the GridION device. MinKNOW v22.12.5 or earlier was used to ensure that all our samples were sequenced using 4KHz sampling. Oligo concatemers were multiplexed as indicated in Supplementary table 1. Each genomic DNA sample was sequenced individually in a single MinION flow cell.\n\nDe-multiplexing and reference assignment\n\nAlthough oligos were concatenated separately, the library preparation protocol contains a ligation step in which all oligo concatemers are pooled together. Therefore, it is possible to get oligo hybrids that contain different reference sequences. For this reason, oligo samples were de-multiplexed using a custom algorithm to detect the individual oligo repeats and barcodes within a read. Given the basecalls of a read, all possible oligo reference sequences within that batch are aligned to the basecalled sequence using a semi-global alignment algorithm (as implemented in the parasail library [61]). The reference sequence with the highest number of matches is considered as the true underlying sequence for that portion of the basecalls. However, only matches to the barcode and guanine 5-mer portions of the reference sequence are considered (max of 26 matches), since the overhang sequence is common for all oligos and the basecalls surrounding 8-oxo-dG cannot be trusted. Then, the aligned portion of the basecalled sequence is masked to avoid further alignment in subsequent iterations. This process is repeated until there are fewer than 15 non-masked bases or more than a set maximum number of iterations is exceeded, which is dependent on the length of the basecalled sequence.\n\nRaw data alignment\n\nRaw data was aligned to the expected signal based on the reference sequence of the read. We used a custom script that featured Tombo’s API [62] to align the two sequences. Notably, the expected signal model is based solely on non-modified bases and therefore, we expected the raw signal corresponding to the 8-oxo-dG and surrounding bases to contain mis-alignments. Because our oligos contain random bases, for which we do not know their true reference, we used their aligned basecalls instead.\n\nBase calling cross-validation\n\nThe oligo concatemers dataset was first split into train and test sets. The test set consisted of 100 reads (chosen at random) per different oligo sequence (total of 22000 reads). To assess model performance during training, a portion of the train set was split into the validation set at random, and kept constant throughout the epochs (10% of the total training examples). The human dataset was first split into train and test sets. The train set consisted of 40000 reads, chosen at random, from odd numbered chromosomes. The test set consisted of 10000 reads, chosen at random, from even numbered chromosomes. In the same manner as the oligo data, 10% of the total training examples was used as a validation set to assess model performance during training.\n\nRaw signal normalization\n\nA common approach to normalize the nanopore raw signal is to center and scale its values based on the set of measurements from the whole read (Equation 1).\n\nWe observed that both the T2T and oligo data had a consistent shift between expected and measured values (Supplementary figure 35,Supplementary figure 36). We attributed this larger shift in the oligo data to the consistently repetitive nature of the oligo sequences, which overall, do not have enough sequence variability to guarantee that the standard normalization approach would work as expected. To avoid normalization bias, which could already distinguish genomic from oligo data at the signal level, we performed a second normalization step. In this second normalization, we calculate what would be the optimal median and mad (Equation 2) values to minimize the distance between measured and expected values after alignment. We do this by first fitting a linear model using least squares regression between the aligned measured and expected values. We then re-scale the initially calculated med and mad values based on the fitted model. Using this second normalization step, we noted that the previously observed signal shift was corrected, and average 6-mer values match between genomic and oligo data (Supplementary figure 37). We applied this 2-step normalization approach on all our data both before training and inference.\n\nBonito fine-tuning\n\nWe fine-tuned a Bonito model to basecall 8-oxo-dG as G. We started from a pre-trained open source state provided by ONT in their public bonito repository. We fine-tuned the model for a total of 43000 training steps using a batch size of 256. The model was fine-tuned using an unbalanced combination of oligo (25% of all training examples) and T2T data (75% of all training examples). We used the Adam [63] optimizer with a constant learning rate of 0.0005. Other parameters of the optimizer were: β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, ε = 1e-8 and λ = 0.0. We used a dropout of 0.1 in between CNN layers, and a dropout of 0.5 in between RNN layers (Supplementary figure 38).\n\nModification calling cross-validation\n\nTo avoid any potential data leakage between the fine-tuning of the base calling model and the training of the modification calling model, we used the same (based on read id) train, validation and test data splits in both steps.\n\nRemora training\n\nWe trained a Remora model to distinguish 8-oxo-dG from a regular G. We used a neural network architecture that first encodes the signal and sequence features via convolution, concatenates the encoded vectors, forwards the concatenated vector through a convolution layer and two recurrent layers, and a final linear layer for classification (Supplementary figure 7). We trained several models with balanced (via upsampling of the positive label samples, or downsampling of the negative label samples) and unbalanced datasets. We also trained models with different positive label weights: 100% 10% or 1%, with different features (Methods, Remora feature-engineering), and a model using metric learning (Methods, Remora metric learning). All models were trained as described in the following paragraph.\n\nWe trained the model as a classical classification problem using cross-entropy as loss function for a total of 235000 training steps using a batch size of 256. We used the Adam [63] optimizer with a variable learning rate, which started at 0.00005 and increased linearly for 5000 training steps until 0.001, and then decreased using a cosine function until 0.00005. Other parameters of the optimizer were: β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, ε = 1e-8 and λ = 0.0. We used a dropout of 0.2 between all layers of the model.\n\nRemora feature engineering\n\nTraditional Remora models from ONT include the raw signal and base calls, centered around the base of interest as input features for the model. We explored the use of additional features, both at the signal and base call level. At the signal level, we used the following features: expected signal aligned to the measured signal based on the base calls from the fine-tuned Bonito model (8-oxo-dG aware), or from the pre-trained Bonito model (not 8-oxo-dG aware); the difference between the measured and expected signals (from both models); the difference between the aforementioned differences. At the sequence level, we used the following features: base calls from both the fine-tuned and pre-trained Bonito models, phred quality scores from both the fine-tuned and pre-trainedBonito models. To ensure local feature information, features (both signal and sequence level) that were further than 3 bases, on either side, of the target G (based on the basecalls) were masked with zeros.\n\nRemora metric learning\n\nWe trained a Remora model using Multi-Similarity loss (α=2, β=50, base=0.5) and Multi-Similarity miner (ε=0.1) [64] as implemented in PyTorch-Metric-learning. Triplets provided by the miner were filtered to only contain samples from the same 5-mer in an effort to force the model to compare the two labels in the same sequence context. Cosine similarity was calculated on the embedding vector output of the last LSTM layer (Supplementary figure 7) and used as a distance metric to calculate the loss. Triplet loss and cross-entropy loss were added together with equal weights before backpropagation.\n\nSpecificity Q-Scoring notation\n\nDue to the low prevalence of 8-oxo-dG, it is necessary to achieve a near-zero false positive rate (10-5-10-7). To make the annotation of these very small values easier, we convert these using the phred quality score (Q) [65].\n\nCell line sequencing\n\nRPE1-hTERT-DAAOH2B wild type (WT) and p53-/- cells were treated for 2h with 20mM L-Alanine or D-Alanine. Afterwards, genomic DNA was harvested using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen REF #69504) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced in the same manner as described for the oligo concatemers (Methods, Library preparation, Nanopore sequencing). For additional information regarding DAAO constructs and Illumina sequencing of these cell lines see van Soest et al [47].\n\nIllumina derived mutation profile\n\nClones were sequenced at 30x base coverage using an Illumina Novaseq 6000 or an Illumina Hiseq X10 sequencing machine. Sequencing reads from all samples were mapped to the human reference GRCh38 genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner v0.7.17. Duplicate sequencing reads were marked using Sambamba MarkDup v0.6.8. Variants in the mapped data were called using GATK Haplotypecaller version 4.1.3.0 using default settings. Variants were filtered using GATK 4.1.3.0 using several filter settings Supplementary table 5.To filter out mutations induced during sequencing, clonal expansion or library preparation, we filtered genomic variants using an in-house filtering pipeline, SMuRF v2.1.1. Briefly, the variant allele frequency (VAF) was calculated for each variant by pileup of all bases mapped at the mutation position. Variant data derived from cell clones were filtered for the following criteria: VAF ≥0.3, base coverage ≥10 and an MQ quality ≥60. To select only mutations occurring during in-vitro culture, variants present in the clonal parental cell line were removed. Recurrent mapping or sequencing artifacts were removed by filtering against a blacklist containing variants present in healthy bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.\n\n8-oxo-dG mutational profile analysis\n\nHigh confidence 8-oxo-dG calls (score > 0.95) from >Q40 5-mers were grouped based on the 3-mer of the opposite strand to facilitate comparison with the C>A profile as described in the COSMIC signatures database. Relative frequencies were calculated as the fraction of counts of each 3-mer given the total amount of counts. Counts per 3-mer were normalized to the amount of training 5-mers per 3-mer. Enrichment was calculated by subtracting the relative frequency of 8-oxo-dG calls from the relative frequency of 3-mers in the T2T reference genome.\n\n8-oxo-dG genomic regions analysis\n\nGenomic region annotations were downloaded for the CHM13v2 telomere-to-telomere (T2T) reference genome (https://github.com/marbl/CHM13). Base calls were aligned to the T2T reference genome using minimap2 [66]. 8-oxo-dG counts (score > 0.95) were normalized per coverage as well as per 5-mer relative abundance per region. 8-oxo-dG counts on 5’-UTR, 3’-UTR, exon and intron regions were only considered if the molecule was found on the same DNA strand as the annotated region; in intergenic, satellite, centromeres and complex repetitive regions 8-oxo-dG counts were considered regardless of the DNA strand. 5’UTR was annotated as the upstream 5000 base pairs before the start of all annotated coding sequences. 3’UTR was annotated as the downstream 5000 base pairs of all annotated coding sequences. Intergenic regions were considered as all intervals that had no annotation.\n\n8-oxo-dG related methylation analysis\n\nAll nanopore sequencing data was methylation called using the guppy tool and ONT’s model dna_r9.4.1_e8.1_modbases_5mc_5hmc_cg_hac.cfg. Methylation calls were mapped to the T2T reference genome assembly, and then extracted using the modkit tool. Analysis was restricted to only 5-mers in the training set. We evaluated the methylation status within a 10 kilobase window centered around any guanine (canonical or 8-oxo-dG). Methylation prediction scores were then averaged per base pair position to calculate the average methylation status. Methylation scores within a 10 base window around 8-oxo-dG were masked out from the analysis because we assume that the methylation calling model is not aware of signal effects that might be caused by a close proximity 8-oxo-dG molecule.\n\n8-oxo-dG telomere analysis\n\nReads whose mapping was primarily to the annotated T2T telomere regions were used for analysis. Based on the reference T2T genome, annotated telomere regions were further constrained to the last TTAGGG repetitive element."
