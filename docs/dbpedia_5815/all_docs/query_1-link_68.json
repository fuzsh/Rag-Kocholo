        "text": "Born in Seville in 1982, the tenor Juan Sancho studied with Lambert Climent, with tuition also from Montserrat Figueras and Marta Almajano. Although he initially specialised in early music, his interests range from the Baroque to Lied and bel canto and he has worked on diverse repertoire with many ensembles and orchestras, including Les Arts Florissants, Europa Galante, the Academy of Ancient Music, La Capilla Reial de Catalunya, the Venice Baroque Orchestra, Les Sacqueboutiers de Toulouse, Il Complesso Barocco, I Barrocchisti, the Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, and others. He has collaborated with conductors including William Christie, Gustav Leonhardt, Jordi Savall, Andrea Marcon, Fabio Biondi, Allan Curtis, Richard Egarr and Diego Fasolis, with appearances at major festivals, the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Ambronay, Antwerp, Bruges and Freiburg, and at several leading theatres, among them the Milan Teatro alla Scala, Barbican Centre (London), Lincoln Center (New York), Alte Oper (Frankfurt), Cité de la Musique (Paris), Opéra Comique (Paris), Salle Pleyel (Paris) and La Fenice (Venice)."
