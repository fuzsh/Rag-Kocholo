In the course of the twenty-three years since I first conceived of taking up this project, I have depended heavily on the generosity of a large intellectual community in multifarious ways, but because this volume embodies only half of the original design, I postpone mentioning those who contributed principally to the still unfinished first and earlier part. The present book could not have been written without the expert advice of Francis Newton and Diskin Clay of Dukes Department of Classical Studies. In the case of Francis Newton, my debt goes back to the beginning of my research on early humanism and before. James Hankins, John Headley, Kenneth Gouwens, Riccardo Fubini, Majorie Curry Woods, and Paul Gaziano read the entire manuscript, each at different stages of its development. Francesca Santoro LHoir, Giuseppe Mazzotta, Timothy Kircher, and Marcello Simonetta willingly gave their comments on chapters 3, 5, 6, and 10 respectively. On specific points I had recourse to the expertise and assistance of Felicia Traub, Patricia Osmond, Robert Bjork, Peter Burian, Mark Sosower, Lucia Stadter, and Edward Mahoney. I am deeply grateful to all these scholars for the corrections and improvements they have made. A presentation of a late version of the manuscript in one of the Duke History Departments Conversations with Colleagues was extremely profitable, as was a similar presentation to the Triangle Intellectual History Seminar. I am deeply in debt to two decades of Duke University Staff members: Dorothy Sapp and Betty Cowan in the 1980s and Jenna Golnik, Andrea Long, and Deborah Carver in the 1990s. Without them I would never have gotten through the series of emergencies plaguing a sometimes absent-minded and technologically naive researcher. Of the dozens of libraries I have visited over the years, I would like to single out for special thanks the staffs of the Bibliothèque nationale of Paris, the Biblioteca nazionale and Biblioteca riccardiana of Florence, the libraries of the American Academy in Rome and Harvards Villa I Tatti in Florence, the Newberry Library, the Biblioteca\n\nviii\n\nacknowledgements\n\napostolica vaticana, and the Duke Library, especially the staff of Special Collections. I would also like to thank Professor Heiko A. Oberman for accepting this book in his series Studies in Medieval and Reformation Thought. Gera van Bedaf, my editor at Brill, was a pleasure to work with. Her professionalism, efficiency and tolerance in this enterprise were remarkable. In the last stages of compiling the bibliography, I relied heavily on the research skills of my undergraduate assistant at Duke, Robert Shibley. Christopher Ross, Walker Robinson, and Philip Tinari helped with proofing. Mark Jurdevic prepared the indexes with intelligence and dispatch. I would especially like to express my deep appreciation for the work of Andrew Sparling, who served as the copyeditor of the manuscript, but whose real contribution extended much further, to the mode of presentation and to the ideas themselves. The general argument, even if necessarily specialized at points, has been rendered far more accessible to a general audience by his having taken it in hand. He could not have been more concerned with the quality of the final version had it been his own work. Finally, I want to thank my family: my three children  for whom the dictates of writing such a book contributed significantly to the context in which they spent much of their youth  performed over time various services too numerous to mention; and my wife of thirty-five years, who has always stood in the front line when it came to testing out my ideas or exploring ways of expressing them. Over the years my research has been generously supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and by a number of foundations. A Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978-79 and a summer grant from the Council of Learned Societies helped me in the initial stages of research. Subsequently, I received a National Endowment for the Humanities for a semesters study in 1983 at the National Humanities Center in the Research Triangle; a second for a semester at the Newberry Library in l991 and a third (with a generous salary supplement from Duke) for a years residence at the American Academy in Rome. A Fulbright-for-Research-in-Two-Countries supported me for a year in Rome and Paris in 1985-86. Five grants from the Duke University Research Council were used for the purchase of microfilm. I can only hope that the results of this study and the one forthcoming will in some measure justify the expenditure of these precious resources. I dedicate this book to the memory of Paul Oskar Kristeller, whose magisterial writings instilled in me the fundamental principle guiding\n\nacknowledgements\n\nix\n\nall my work: that an appreciation of the distinctiveness of the Italian Renaissance cannot be had apart from an understanding of the medieval culture out of which it developed. Mine is only one of many testimonies to Kristellers enormous contribution to the study of medieval and Renaissance culture. Those of us in this field can fittingly attribute to his achievement the assessment Boccaccio rendered of Petrarchs in his letter to Jacopo Pizzinga in 1372: He has opened the road for himself and for those who want to ascend after him. R.W.

Whereas elsewhere on the subcontinent ecclesiastics controlled educational institutions and intellectual life generally, in Italy, primarily in the northern and central parts of the peninsula, laymen played a major role from the early twelfth century and became dominant after 1300. Lay intellectuals were largely associated in earlier centuries with legal studies, but after 1300 there emerged an intellectual movement, Italian humanism, which ultimately established laymens lives as equal in moral value to those of clerics and monks. The methods and goals of humanist education, already well-defined by the early fifteenth century, were to become the underpinnings of elite education in western Europe down to the nineteenth. Despite the central importance of the humanist movement for the evolution of western European society, the present study maintains that our current understanding of the first century and a half of its development has been misconceived in a number of significant ways. A serious re-examination of humanisms early history makes it possible to understand its genesis, its subsequent development to the midfifteenth century, and the distinctive characteristics that set it off from its earlier analogue, usually referred to as twelfth-century French humanism. A brief chronology of my own thinking on the subject should serve to explain the reasons for my dissatisfaction with contemporary scholarship on the origins and early stages of humanism and to illuminate the approach that I have taken to the problem. My original interest in the issues of humanisms origins and growth was sparked by Paul Oskar Kristellers classic definition of the Italian humanists as essentially rhetoricians and heirs to the tradition of the medieval dictatores. In contrast with the tendency of previous scholars to speak generally of humanism as offering a philosophy of life, Kristeller developed a definition of humanism based on the professional role of the humanists in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century\n\n2\n\nchapter one\n\nItalian society.1 He argued that the humanists usually worked as teachers of rhetoric and grammar or served as notaries and lawyers. The latter two professional groups were charged with writing letters and making speeches on behalf of political powers. They were not philosophers but instead specialized in rhetoric, grammar, history, and ethics, areas of learning reflected in the kinds of issues they wrote about.2 According to Kristeller, perhaps the only philosophical idea that they all shared was a belief in the dignity of the human being, and this conviction usually emerged only as an implicit assumption in their work.3 Professionally, Kristeller maintained, the humanists of the Italian Renaissance played the same role in their society as did the dictatores of the Middle Ages in theirs: they were rhetoricians who served as public officials in princely and communal chanceries and taught grammar and rhetoric in the schools. Concerned as were their predecessors primarily with the art of letter writing and the composition and delivery of speeches, the humanists differed from their medieval counterparts, nevertheless, in relying on models drawn from classical texts.4 Over the last fifty years, Kristellers analysis of humanism has advanced scholarly discussion of the movement by stressing the importance of understanding the medieval intellectual culture out of which humanism arose, especially the traditions of the disciplines in which the humanists worked and of the genres of writing that they employed. Kristellers definition failed to account for Petrarch and Boccaccio, the two great leaders of Trecento humanism, who neither taught nor served as public officials; it also excluded from considera1 His original statement of the thesis is found in Humanism and Scholasticism in the Italian Renaissance, Byzantion 17 (194445): 34674, most recently published in Renaissance Thought and Its Sources, ed. M. Mooney (New York, 1979), 85105. My references will be to the latter version. 2 For Kristellers enumeration of the basic studia humanitatis, see his The Humanist Movement, Renaissance Thought and Its Sources, esp. 22, and in the same volume, Humanism and Scholasticism, 92 and 98. For his detailed discussion of humanist achievements in these disciplines, see esp. 2531 and 9298. 3 Kristeller, The Humanist Movement, 32. 4 He recognizes that humanism had an important grammatical component and suggests that the medieval French grammatical tradition was one of its sources. He particularly stresses the role of the French practice of textual commentary: Eight Philosophers of the Italian Renaissance (Stanford, 1964), 16062. Cf. Humanism and Scholasticism, 91 and 9697. Nevertheless, he insists that professionally the humanists were rhetoricians and the successors of the medieval dictatores: The Humanist Movement, 2324. Cf. Humanism and Scholasticism, 9293.\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\ntion the many private individuals after 1400 who never used their humanistic training to earn a living.5 The studies of Charles Trinkaus and others on the religious and philosophic interests of the humanists, moreover, have accented the humanists philosophical and religious interests more than did Kristellers works.6 In William Bouwsmas opinion, the narrow focus of Kristeller on the humanists contribution to specific areas of the traditional educational curriculum has tended to have the unintended effect of reducing our perception of its rich variety and thus of limiting our grasp of its historical significance.7 Nonetheless, Kristellers characterization of the humanists, the scope of their interests, and their role in society has survived largely intact because it integrated most of the phenomena associated with the movement. Kristeller was more interested in describing humanism than in explaining its etiology. In fact, he only suggested in passing two possible causes for its origin: the influence of grammatical interests imported from France late in the thirteenth century and the revival of a 5 Kristeller, Humanism and Scholasticism, 93, recognized that the two did not fit his definition, but in Petrarcas Stellung in der Geschichte der Gelehrsamkeit, Italien und die Romania in Humanismus und Renaissance: Festschrift für Erich Loos zum 70 Geburtstage, ed. K.W. Kempfer and E. Straub (Wiesbaden, 1983), 104, he partly justifies his position by pointing out that Petrarch occasionally performed tasks associated with a professional dictator for the Visconti, Carrara, Colonna, and perhaps also the Correggio families. 6 Among the early humanists, these scholars single out Salutati and Valla as having philosophical interests. Among the writings of Charles Trinkaus on the subject, see especially Coluccio Salutatis Critique of Astrology in the Context of His Natural Philosophy, Speculum 64 (1989): 4668; and Lorenzo Vallas Anti-Aristotelian Natural Philosophy, I Tatti Studies: Essays in the Renaissance 5 (1993): 279325. See also Salvatore Camporeale, Lorenzo Valla, Umanesimo e Teologia (Florence, 1972); and my Hercules, 31354. Kristeller states his position most clearly in The Philosophy of Man in the Italian Renaissance, Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic and Humanist Strains (New York, 1961), 138: The humanistic movement which in its origin was not philosophical provided the general and still vague ideas and aspirations as well as the ancient source materials. The Platonists and Aristotelians, who were professional philosophers with speculative interests and training, took up those vague ideas, developed them into definite philosophical doctrines, and assigned them an important place in their elaborate metaphysical systems. 7 William J. Bouwsma, The Two Faces of Humanism: Stoicism and Augustinianism in Renaissance Thought, Itinerarium Italicum: The Profile of the Italian Renaissance in the Mirror of Its European Transformations: Dedicated to Paul Oskar Kristeller on the Occasion of his 70th Birthday, ed. Heiko A. Oberman with Thomas A. Brady, Jr. (Leiden, 1975), 3. Cf. Kenneth Gouwens, Perceiving the Past: Renaissance Humanism after the Cognitive Turn, American Historical Review 103 (1998): 58.\n\n4\n\nchapter one\n\nconcern with ancient literature and history occurring at the same time in the Veneto, particularly at Padua. To his mind, humanism appeared to have resulted from the Italians combination of a domesticated French grammatical tradition with an evolving local rhetorical orientation.8 Kristellers reluctance to be more precise about the origins of humanism is not untypical of scholarship on the Renaissance over the last fifty years. Impressed with the complexity of major historical changes, modern scholars have largely refrained from making more than modest suggestions about which factors may have given rise to a movement of humanisms scope. The search for humanisms origins, moreover, blends easily into the wider pursuit of the origins of the Italian Renaissance as a whole, the broader problem on which the narrower one intimately depends.9 Before such a challenge, humility would seem the proper attitude. My own account does not offer an explanation for the Renaissance but rather is concerned only with the development of humanism. My argument is that the advent of humanism was intimately connected with the broad, longterm changes in Italian political, economic, social, and cultural life that were creating the first early modern European society. The move8 Kristeller, Humanism and Scholasticism, 97. Kristeller describes France as exercising leadership in the Middle Ages in the study of ancient Roman literature, in the composition of Latin poetry, and in theology. Until the late thirteenth century, in his view, Italy focused its scholarly concern on practical subjects like law and medicine. The Italian rhetorical interests of the medieval period were likewise practical, focusing on the composition of speeches for political occasions and letters devoted to business. Kristeller considers humanism as arising from a fusion between the novel interest in classical studies imported from France toward the end of the thirteenth century and the much earlier traditions of medieval Italian rhetoric (ibid., 97, with notes). B.L. Ullman, Some Aspects of the Origin of Italian Humanism, in his Studies in the Italian Renaissance, 2nd ed. (Rome, 1973), 2931, places the contact a few decades later, emphasizing the importance of Avignon in bringing Italians into contact with French classical culture. Without specifically focusing on Italian humanism, J. Nordström, Moyen âge et Renaissance: Essai historique, trans. T. Hammar (Paris, 1933), stresses the general influence of French art and the French language, chansons de geste, romances, and goliardic poetry on thirteenth-century Italian culture. Cf. Paul Renucci, Laventure de lhumanisme européen au moyen âge (IVeXIV siècle) (Paris, 1953), 138172. Franco Simone, Medieval French Culture and Italian Humanism, in The French Renaissance, trans. H. Gaston Hall (London, 1969), 27990, stresses the importance of Avignon as a center for the transmission of French culture to Italians. 9 An example of a contemporary effort to deal with both problems at once is George Holmes, Florence, Rome and the Origins of the Renaissance (Oxford, 1986). Although skillfully relating artistic and intellectual developments with a focus on the first decade of the fourteenth century, Holmess account is essentially descriptive.\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nment served, first of all, to promote the transformation and second, to validate the new societys achievements. Coming to Europe in the fall of 1978 on a Guggenheim Fellowship in search of humanisms origins, I spent most of the following year of research continuing my study of the writings of the dictatores: manuals of letter writing (artes dictaminis), which date from the late eleventh century, and manuals of speech composition (artes arengandi), beginning in the early thirteenth century. Included in my reading as well were the remnants of other writings by dictatores, together with a selection of handbooks for composing sermons (artes predicandi), whose composition dates in Italy from the early thirteenth century. By the end of the year, it became clear to me that the connection between fourteenth-century humanists and dictatores of the previous century lay in the stylistic continuity of public rhetoric: humanists who wrote official letters and gave speeches continued to use medieval rhetorical forms.10 In fact, until the late fourteenth century, in their professional work as chancery officials or teachers of rhetoric, humanists carried forward medieval rhetorical traditions of expression and, in some cases, they even composed treatises on ars dictaminis. In contrast, significant stylistic changes in the direction of imitating ancient rhetoric occurred in those writings composed by humanists as private individuals. Even here, though, change did not happen simultaneously across all genres of prose composition. Not surprisingly, the last to be reformed were the oration and the public letter, genres of primary concern to dictatores. While Kristeller was right to present the humanists as professionally the heirs of the dictatores, the continuity that the humanists forged, at least until about 1400, rested on their persistent embrace of medieval rhetorical forms. Insofar as they were humanists, these fourteenth-century chancellors and teachers owed little or nothing to the tradition of ars dictaminis.11 On my return from France, my reading of Quentin Skinners Foundations of Modern Political Thought, which argues that a change in Italian ars dictaminis led to the birth of humanism, helped me clarify\n\nFor the meaning of public, see below, n. 19. At the most, experience with dictamen would have served to guide Tuscan and Bolognese dictatores to focus on translations of ancient prose rather than poetry and sharpened their sensitivity to language and expression. 10 11\n\n6\n\nchapter one\n\nmy own thoughts.12 Skinner argues that French medieval classicism affected French ars dictaminis and in turn Italian dictatores. The argument rests on a series of misconceptions about the relationships of French to Italian dictamen and of Italian dictamen to Italian humanism.13 My critique of his analysis led me to define more clearly the interrelationship (or more properly, the lack of one) between humanism and the two schools of dictamen. By 1981, besides having concluded that humanism had not arisen as an offshoot of dictamen, I had arrived at three further conclusions: first, that humanism did not invade all literary genres simultaneously, but rather successively coopted one genre after another over almost two centuries; second, that the order of penetration was not a matter of happenstance, but that for reasons both intrinsic to the genre and arising from cultural precedent, the first genre affected was poetry; and third, that, because it began in poetry, the origins of humanism were to be found not in rhetoric but in grammar, the traditional 12 Quentin Skinner, The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, 2 vols. (New York and London, 1978). 13 Skinner, Foundations, 1:3539, maintains that contact with French ars dictaminis, heavily influenced by twelfth-century French classicism, led Italian dictatores (he mentions Jacques de Dinant and Latini as examples) living in France to reform the practical rhetoric of Italian dictaminal tradition. Latini is specifically designated as encountering Ciceros rhetorical writings there for the first time, an encounter that convinced him to introduce a far more literary and classical flavour into his own writings in Ars Dictaminis (37). The introduction of this classical rhetoric, Skinner claims, led students, among them Mussato and Geri dArezzo, back to the ancient texts (3738). First of all, Jacques de Dinant was not Italian, and the Ciceronian rhetorical texts that Skinner mentions, the De inventione and Ad Herennium, had circulated in Italy throughout the medieval period. Although Latini has long been recognized as influenced by Vincent of Beauvais Speculum when writing his encyclopedic Tresor, there is no evidence that he was influenced by French dictamen practices. Aristide Marigo, Cultura letteraria e preumanistica nelle maggiori enciclopedie del Duecento, Giornale storico della letteratura italiana 68 (1916): 142, and 289326, discusses Latinis sources. Pons of Provence in the mid-thirteenth century was the last important French dictator and he gave short shrift to the ancients. Subsequently, Italian authors, Faba, Bene, and Boncompagno, dominated the moribund ars in France. Thus, the influence of the dictaminal traditions was the reverse of that maintained by Skinner. As for the effect of Latinis French classical experience on dictamen, until after 1350 (and even then rarely) it would be difficult to find ancient authors cited in dictamen texts. Stilus humilis dominate Italian dictamen after 1250. Skinner never explains how Mussato and Geri relate to dictamen, but in any case, we shall see that Lovato, a member of Latinis generation, was the major contemporary influence on Mussato, and Lovatos genre was poetry. By contrast, I will suggest a much earlier influence of French classicism, beginning in the 1180s. By Latinis time, Italians were moving away from French influences.\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\ndomain for poetry.14 I only gradually understood the tremendous significance of this fact for the interpretation of the movement. Accordingly, over the next seven years I sought to trace the grammatical tradition in medieval Italian culture. The preliminary results of my investigation, published in 1988 in an article entitled The Origins of Humanism as a Stylistic Ideal, were as follows:15 As historically defined in western Europe, grammar and rhetoric constituted two very different centers around which to organize education and ultimately a way of life. The two disciplines first emerged in the Greco-Roman system of education. As it existed in the golden days of the Roman Empire in the first century B.C.E. and the first century of the Christian era, the curriculum of the schools treated rhetoric as the superior discipline in the educational hierarchy. The task of the grammarian was to prepare the student to pass on to the school of rhetoric, where he could learn the subject that would enable him to participate fully in the political life of the state. Although subordinate, grammatical studies provided students with skills that extended beyond the requirements for entering the school of rhetoric; in this way, the grammarian managed to promote some of his own intellectual interests.16 The grammarian began his educational program on the assumption that his charges had learned the elements of reading and writing from the ludi magister, the elementary school teacher. The grammariTwo articles of John OMalley, Grammar and Rhetoric in the Pietas of Erasmus, Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies 18 (1988): 8198, and Egidio da Viterbo, O.S.A. e il suo tempo, Studia augustiniana historica 9 (1983): 6884, both dealing with the distinctive concerns and interests of the grammarian and rhetorician in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, helped clarify my views. Although the text of the first article was only published in 1988, Prof. OMalley made it (initially prepared for another journal) available to me years earlier. This work also brought to my attention O.B. Hardisons The Orator and the Poet: The Dilemma of Humanist Literature, Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies 1 (1971): 3344, which elaborates on the contrasts between the poet and the orator. 15 The article was published in Renaissance Humanism: Foundations, Forms, and Legacy, ed. Albert Rabil, 3 vols. (Philadelphia, 1988), 1:2970. 16 S.F. Bonner, Education in Ancient Rome: From the Elder Cato to the Younger Pliny (Berkeley, 1977), 189ff., especially 250. See also H.I. Marrou, A History of Education in Antiquity, trans. G. Lamb (New York, 1956), 22342 and 26781. Bonner, 21819, suggests that ancient grammarians may have used prose works to provide students with initial exercises in composition, but that they did not indulge in the detailed analysis of prose as they did for poetry. G.A. Kennedy, The Art of Persuasion in Greece (Princeton, 1963), 269, acknowledges some overlap but considers the study of poets to have belonged principally to the school of grammar and that of the prose writers to the school of rhetoric. 14\n\n8\n\nchapter one\n\nans own task was to give the student a good understanding of Latin grammar, an appreciation of literature, and initial training in the art of composition. At the outset, detailed study was devoted to the letters of the alphabet, the syllables, and the parts of speech. Selections from the poets served as the basis for a minute examination of syntax and provided the students with an introduction to literary analysis. In the course of a line-by-line study of a poem, the grammarian discussed the authors biography, the historical and mythological references found in the work, the metric, the etymology of the vocabulary, and the various figures of speech that the poet used. He taught the student to search for truth hidden beneath a veil of imagery. Close study of the text incidentally revealed discrepancies in different copies and thereby encouraged the grammarian to engage in textual criticism. The student left the grammar school with some experience in reciting poetry and composing short pieces of prose, but delivery and longer prose composition were to be the main objectives of his training from then on. The rhetor set his students to imitating the great prose writers of the culture, especially the orators. Students learned to declaim, debate, and deliver orations of their own making. Success at such assignments augured well for their future standing in elite ancient society. The educational programs of the grammar and rhetorical schools were linked. The rhetor presupposed grammatical training in his students: the rules of prosody learned earlier facilitated the mastering of prose metric required for orations, and appropriate citations from the poets proved a vital ingredient in making an impressive speech. The grammarian, for his part, used some prose texts in his instruction, and interpretation of the poets could not have been made without help of the colores rhetorici borrowed from the rhetor. Students had to understand the figures of thought and style, tropes, and commonplaces in order to interpret clearly both the outer and inner meanings of poetry. In his dependence on devices of rhetoric to accomplish his ends, the grammarian resorted to what George Kennedy calls secondary rhetoric.17 For Kennedy, primary rhetoric is the art of speech17 G.A. Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times (Chapel Hill, 1980), 45, establishes the distinction between primary and secondary rhetoric. Marjorie Curry Wood, The Teaching of Writing in Medieval Europe, in A Short History of Writing Instruction from Ancient Greece to Twentieth-\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\nmaking and develops out of the needs of public life. It includes speeches, impromptu and written, and, I would add, at least for the ancient and medieval periods, public letters that were delivered orally and therefore qualified as speeches. From late antiquity, sermons also constituted an important form of oratorical expression. Under secondary rhetoric Kennedy groups all other literary genres, for example, history, private correspondence, poetry, and philosophical discussion when it has literary pretensions. In this wider arena, rhetoric relates to invention, arrangement, and especially to style  in other words, to the particular selection of words and their order, chosen by the author whether he is writing prose or poetry. While I follow Kennedys division between two categories of rhetoric in this book, I am unable to accept his terminology of primary and secondary. Not only is it difficult to prove that primary rhetoric historically preceded secondary rhetoric, i.e., that oratory came before poetry, but also the claim, implicit in the terminology, that oration enjoyed a privileged position as a form of verbal expression, while true for antiquity, cannot be extended to Europe in the Middle Ages or Renaissance. Retaining Kennedys two descriptive categories, consequently, I have preferred to label them oratorical rhetoric and literary rhetoric. While I acknowledge that oratorical discourse was also in a sense literary, I have chosen to make oratorical rhetoric a separate category, because unlike other genres of rhetoric, it was a prose that aimed at public, oral expression.18 To privilege oration as essentially public and to imply that other literary genres are private is to claim less than might at first appear. Century America, ed. James J. Murphy (Davis, Calif., 1990), 7794, points out convincingly that Kennedys terminology as well as his description of the relationship of the two rhetorics implicitly subordinates secondary rhetoric to primary rhetoric. She suggests that the terminology be reversed and oratory be seen as a subset of what Kennedy defines as secondary rhetoric. Although the unique history of oratorical expression in early humanism cautions me against embracing this suggestion, the cogency of her critique of Kennedys terminology, which I had earlier accepted (see my Origins, 31), has led me to develop another way of describing the two rhetorics. 18 The early Italian humanists did not make the distinction between two kinds of rhetoric that I make here. Of the medieval Italian dictatores, only Boncompagno felt the distinctiveness of oratory from other forms of verbal expression. In fact, he identified oratory with rhetoric and resisted the efforts of the grammatici at transforming orations into literary compositions. He sharply distinguished between oratores, grammatici, and dialectici (see my Boncompagno and the Defense of Rhetoric, The Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies 16 [1986]: 713).\n\n10\n\nchapter one\n\nAll literary genres have the potential to inform opinion on issues of public concern. It is obvious that even in a premodern world, where public and private power intermingled and the institutions and technology for the creation of public opinion were lacking, those making decisions for the whole community could be influenced by whatever they read or heard.19 My justification for referring to oration as the genre of public rhetoric resides primarily in the nature of the forums in which the author intended or imagined his work would be received and only secondarily in the purpose informing its writing. Always composed with its presentation before some kind of public assembly in mind, the oration was usually  but not necessarily  concerned with some matter regarding civic culture or political affairs.20 Besides conceiving of rhetoric as oratorical or literary, I would add that it can also be more broadly considered as a way of thought that informs both oratorical and literary rhetoric. It is a form of reasoning that seeks conclusions by inference rather than by demonstration and whose weapon is more often the enthymeme than the syllogism.21 As 19 Since the publication of Jürgen Habermass Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit: Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft (Frankfurt-am-Main, 1962), the discussion of the creation of an authentic public sphere in eighteenth-century Europe has led to numerous analyses of the public and private spheres of life in the medieval and early modern periods. Among the most important are Public and Private in Social Life, ed. S. I. Benn and G. F. Graus (London, 1983); G. Duby, Ouverture: Pouvoir privé, pouvoir public, Historie de la vie privée, ed. Georges Duby and Philippe Ariès, 5 vols. (Paris, 198587), 2:1944; Dena Goodman, Public Sphere and Private Life: Toward a Synthesis of Current Historiographical Approaches to the Old Regime, History and Theory, 31 (1992): 120; Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge, Mass., 1992); Anthony J. La Vopa, Conceiving a Public: Ideas and Society in Eighteenth-Century Europe, Journal of Modern History 64 (1992): 79116; and Giorgio Chittolini, Il privato, il pubblico, lo Stato, in Origini dello stato. Processi di formazione statale in Italia fra medioevo ed età moderna, ed. Giorgio Chittolini, Anthony Molho, and Pierangelo Schiera (Bologna, 1994), 55390. 20 For the ancients, all oration, even the funeral oration, was essentially connected with political and civic life. The revival of ancient oratorical forms by the humanists in the Renaissance was accompanied by the same tendency. Prolusions to university courses perhaps constituted exceptions to the rule. Also, if sermons are considered to be orations, they constitute a problem for that part of my definition concerning the focus on public matters. Given the close connection between secular and ecclesiastical affairs, the sermon criticizing not only secular but also ecclesiastical government could be considered as speaking to public issues, but most sermons pertained to the relationship of the believers and their god. 21 The contrast here is between a means of proof in which probable premises are used in order to establish a probable conclusion and a means of proof in which two premises are used to deduce a logical conclusion.\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nsuch, rhetoric not only contrasts with Aristotelian dialectic but also with the grammarians favored pursuit of knowledge through etymological distinctions, glosses of texts, analogy, and allegory. While in reality interdependence must be acknowledged, it is meaningful to see the grammarianpoet and the rhetoricianorator as representing two poles of attraction, one or the other of which characterizes the dominant tendencies operative in many individual writers and movements. The contrast between the grammarian and the rhetorician highlights two different approaches to knowledge and, potentially, two contrasting ways of life. Outside the classroom, the grammarian in his own work remains a student of texts, a philologist, a specialist in mythology. He finds pleasure in treating the smallest details of a poem, eager to find there a word or phrase that can unveil a general truth of natural, moral, or theological import. He delights in allegory. The poet is himself a grammarian who feels the need to express the movements of his emotions and thoughts through verbal images. Whether as creative artist or as philologist, the grammarian requires the quiet of the study or of solitary places. He leads a private life, a vita contemplativa, and the audience for his work ranges from a group of specialists to a relatively small elite with literary tastes. By contrast, the life of the rhetorician is the vita activa, aimed ideally at the achievement of practical goals. Essentially an orator, he best realizes his objectives in public assemblies or the marketplace. Admittedly, to exercise his profession he needs the technical preparation that the grammarian provides, but grammatical learning, primarily knowledge of the poets, provides only raw material for his speeches. He remains uninterested in obscure meanings or hidden messages: his concern is clarity and his goal is action. Both within the system of education and in terms of the rewards given by society at large, the rhetorician or orator of the first centuries before and after Christ was superior in standing to the grammarian, and that hierarchy endured in ancient culture long after the political institutions that justified it had vanished. With the collapse of the empire and the disappearance of an extensive public capable of understanding an oration delivered in ancient Latin, the rhetorician lost his preeminence and the grammarian stepped out of his shadow. The concern for rhetoric by no means disappeared. The ancient speech manuals  especially the work of Ciceros youth, the De inventione  came to provide training in composition applicable to\n\n12\n\nchapter one\n\nall forms of literary expression. But more than this, the Middle Ages inherited, particularly from the late empire, an interest in rhetoric as a way of reasoning, and after 1000, rhetoric became a part of the study of logic. The Carolingian Renaissance of the late eighth and early ninth centuries, directed by a ruler bent on raising the educational level of his people, represented a triumph for the grammarian. For Alcuin, the so-called schoolmaster of the empire, grammar was without a doubt the queen of the trivium: Grammar is the science of letters and the guardian of right speech and writing.22 For him the art embraced not merely letters, syllables, words, and parts of speech, but also figures of speech, the art of prosody, poetry, stories, and history. Although Alcuin and his contemporaries acknowledged that theology was the supreme field of study, the theologians, whose methodology required the filiation of etymologies of terms and analyses of allegories, were of necessity practitioners of grammar. The limited number of those who knew Latin necessarily restricted the role of oratorical or public rhetoric in Carolingian society. Accounts of school curricula indicate no serious training in either speech writing or delivery. Sermons appear to have been largely repetitions of patristic homilies.23 Admittedly, Alcuin did compose a dialogue on the art of rhetoric, Dialogus de rhetorica et virtutibus, eighty per cent of which derived from Ciceros De inventione. With Charlemagne as narrator, Alcuin presented a curious account of rhetoric, almost entirely focused on judicial oratory.24 The extent to which Latin pleading was useful in a legal system based on custom is questionable, as is the level of priority Latin would have had even for clerics. Perhaps, although conditions fostering Latin oratory in the society were absent, Alcuin wished to cover this art of the trivium with a manual, as he had covered the other two. Lacking an orientation dictated by contemporary needs, in making his exposition he merely took over Ciceros focus on judicial oratory.25 22 Alcuin of York, Opusculum primum: Grammatica, in PL, ed. J.P. Migne, vol. 101 (Paris, 1863), cols. 857d58a. 23 J. Longère, La prédication médiévale (Paris, 1983), 3454, discusses Carolingian reliance on homilies constructed by piecing together texts from the Fathers. There is, however, evidence of occasional originality (H. Barré, Les homéliaires carolingiens de lécole dAuxerre: Authenticité, inventaire, tableaux comparatifs, initia [Vatican City, 1962]). 24 Rhetores latini minores, ed. K. Halm (Leipzig, 1863), 52550. 25 Luitpold Wallach, Alcuin and Charlemagne: Studies in Carolingian History and Literature (Ithaca, 1959), 71, interprets the motive for the work otherwise: The Rhetoric is made\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\nAlthough the Carolingian Renaissance lost its impetus by the middle years of the ninth century with the break-up of the Carolingian Empire, a structure of education oriented around grammar continued to dominate the schools of Europe for at least two more centuries.26 By the late twelfth century, however, the ascendancy of grammar in northern Europe was threatened by a new passion for the study of logic. Taught for the first time in a systematic fashion by Gerbert at Rheims in the last quarter of the tenth century, the initial textbooks of logic formed what came to be known as the logica vetus (the old logic). It was composed of the elementary works of Aristotles Organon and a small collection of commentaries and introductory manuals on logic by other ancient authors.27 Rhetorics independent status had already been threatened in the late ancient world, now rhetoric came to be viewed as subordinate to logic as a species to a genus.28 By the middle of the twelfth century, the advanced works of Aristotles Organon, the logica nova (new logic), began to circulate, and the curriculum for teaching logic with rhetoric as an important compoup of rhetorical doctrine, not because Alcuin wanted to write a rhetorical textbook, but because Alcuin wished to describe the mores of Charlemagne as those that ought to serve as examples to his subjects .... 26 On the role of the cathedral and monastic schools in France from the ninth to the twelfth centuries, see J.

Colish, Eleventh-Century Grammar in the Thought of St. Anselm, in Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge (Montreal and Paris, 1969), 789, describes logic in this century as Aristotelianized grammar. Cf. Charles M. Radding, A World Made by Men: Cognition and Society, 4001200 (Chapel Hill, 1985), 16686. 28 R. McKeon, Rhetoric in the Middle Ages, Speculum 17 (1942): 1516. Carolingian writers had occasionally treated rhetoric as a part of logic, but the new concern with logic from the late tenth century brought the nature of the relationship to the fore. McKeon, 12 and 1415, also notes the tendency of rhetoric to be tied to theology as the art of stating truths certified by theology (15).\n\n14\n\nchapter one\n\nnent assumed the general form it was to take down to the nineteenth century. The newly discovered texts further intensified the passion of scholars for logic because of the promise they held for advances in scientific and theological investigation. By 1200, already on the defensive, spokesmen for the grammatical tradition were overcome by the proponents of the new philosophical and theological disciplines, who could point to exciting discoveries produced by new methodologies. Although we must avoid exaggerating the extent to which grammatical interests declined after 1200, at least we can say that the rich production of Latin letters and poetry emanating from the cathedral schools of twelfth-century France, Germany, and England came to an end. The most exciting intellectual achievements of northern Europeans in the thirteenth century were in logic, natural science, and theology. While in France rhetoric as a form of reasoning was studied as an auxiliary to logic, in northern and central Italy the reverse was true. Throughout the five centuries following the fall of Rome, northern and central Italy continued to depend on written documents as records of important forms of human interaction and, consequently, on lay and clerical notaries, who knew how to capture legal reality in formulas. Broad strata of the general population had frequent contact with documents, and elementary Latin literacy seems to have been relatively widespread.29 The evolution of the trivium in northern and central Italy cannot, in fact, be understood unless the culture of books is studied alongside the culture of documents. Beginning around 1000, a conjunction of demographic, political, and economic revivals compelled notaries to turn to Roman law (codified in the Justinian corpus) in order to resolve legal issues of greater complexity and to devise new formulas to meet the needs of\n\n29 For some statistics on lay and clerical literacy in the eighth century in Italy, see A.

Brian Stock, The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Princeton, 1983), 41, stresses the importance of the Italian notariate in the early medieval centuries, but within his general discussion, Italian precedence in literacy plays no particular role.

LeGoff, Alle origini del lavoro intellectuale in Italia: I problemi del rapporto fra la letteratura, luniversità e le professioni, LI 1:65152.\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\na progressively more specialized urban society.30 The Roman lawyer appeared, and with him a new book culture, but a practically oriented one. Almost always a layman, he was both a practitioner and a teacher. In the latter capacity, he studied the Justinian legal corpus, interpreted legal passages for his students, and prepared them for careers as litigators in the courts.31 Given the lawyers interests, Cicero proved a more useful guide than Aristotle or Boethius. While Ciceros judicial eloquence was beyond their powers, his teaching in reasoning and oratorical tactics furnished invaluable help for constructing arguments. Cicero had had his own dialectic, but in it syllogism played a minor role, the emphasis being on inference, on a consideration of consequences, and on a fortiori arguments.32 Nevertheless, Cicero thought that a syllogism could at times be a useful tool for an orator, even when arguing a practical point. At least into the thirteenth century, logic was largely taught in connection with legal studies and probably in the law classroom itself.33 As in their eleventh-century French counterparts, Italian cathedral schools north of Rome preserved Carolingian book culture, stressing instruction in the ancient writers, especially the poets. Nor in this century before the great flourishing of Latin letters in France did the Italians appear in any way inferior in their own poetic compositions to the French. In contrast with the French cathedral schools, however, the Italian ones had no monopoly on advanced education: whereas they controlled the teaching of ancient letters, Roman legal studies fell largely to the lay lawyer teaching in his own school.34 In 30 Charles Radding, The Origins of Medieval Jurisprudence: Pavia and Bologna 8501150 (New Haven, 1988), 37112, details the beginning of formal legal studies at Pavia in the early eleventh century. 31 See Witt, Medieval Italian Culture, 3940. 32 On Ciceros dialectic, see A. Cantin, Les sciences séculières et la foi: Les deux voix de la science au jugement de S. Pierre Damien (10071072) (Spoleto, 1975), 38384. 33 In an extensive reading of Italian chancery and notarial documents from the eleventh and twelfth centuries, I have found only one reference to a dialectician, presumably a teacher. In 1140, Petrus dialecticus witnessed an episcopal document in Mantua (LArchivio capitolare della cattedrale di Mantova fino alla caduta dei Bonacolsi, ed. Pietro Torelli [Verona, 1924], 26, doc. 18). It is revealing that the compilation of articles in Linsegnamento della logica a Bologna nel XIV secolo, ed. D. Buzzetti, M Ferriani, and A. Tabarroni, Studi e memorie per la storia dellUniversità di Bologna, n.s., 8 (Bologna, 1992), makes no reference to the history of logic at Bologna before the second half of the thirteenth century. 34 Witt, Medieval Italian Culture, 4244.\n\n16\n\nchapter one\n\nthe next century, moreover, when, with the composition of Gratians Decretum around 1140, canon law became a subject for academic study, canon lawyers not uncommonly taught their courses independently of the cathedral. By the end of the eleventh century, the development of a highly simplified form of letter writing known as ars dictaminis further enhanced the role of rhetoric in Italian education and created more competition for cathedral education. Composed in manual form, often combined with a collection of letters illustrating the principles taught in the text, ars dictaminis, with its simple rules, made letter writing available to large numbers of people with but a few years of training in elementary Latin. Since the teacher or dictator needed only a manual, ars dictaminis could be easily taught by independent masters. Read aloud, letters tended to be regarded as speeches, and writers of manuals naturally looked to the rhetorical manuals attributed to Cicero for help. While authors of the medieval manuals made occasional references to the De inventione and the pseudo-Ciceronian Ad Herennium, however, the ancient textbooks had very little stylistic effect on ars dictaminis. Their main use in the classroom seems to have been to provide the student with training in the art of constructing logical arguments. A major casualty in Gregory VIIs program of ecclesiastical reforms was the cathedral school, that institution in which the grammatical curriculum of northern and central Italy had thrived. Within the last twenty-five years of the eleventh century, Italian cathedral chapters appear to have been riven by disputes over aspects of reform such as clerical marriage and lay investiture. Shattered by factional strife, schools disappear from the documentation of chapter life, in some cases for many decades. Although a few cathedral schools, like that at Lucca, survived in the twelfth century as centers of liberal-arts training, most others seem to have been committed to the modest task of preparing the diocesan clergy for the performance of their religious functions. 35 The withering of cathedral-school education entailed the deterioration of the traditional program of grammatical education going back to the Carolingian period. The intellectual life of northern and central Italy in the twelfth century was largely driven by legalrhetorical concerns and directed 35\n\nIbid., 41.\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\nby dictatores and Roman and canon lawyers. Only a small number of Latin poems, most of them patriotic epics, survive from this century.36 The extent of grammar training was generally determined by the humble demands of ars dictaminis. In the case of the elite who went beyond dictamen to legal studies, training in reading and writing legal Latin formed part of many years instruction under a lawyers direction. The fortunes of grammar revived after 1180, when a massive invasion of French scholarly and literary influences transformed the intellectual life of Italy north of Rome. At the height of their glory  not a hundred years later, when in decline, as is commonly thought  French grammarians and poets made their major contribution to the brilliant future of letters and scholarship in Italy.37 After almost a century of playing an auxiliary role to rhetoric, grammatical studies required decades to revive; but the burst of Latin poetic composition in northern Italy by the middle of the thirteenth century shows their vigorous development by that time.38 Because the earliest surviving humanist writings are the Latin poems written by Lovato dei Lovati in 1267/68, humanism appears to have been a part of the advanced stage of the grammatical revival. Indeed, a careful reading of the poetic and prose production of northern and central Italians in the decades after the appearance of Lovatos poems indicates that humanistic classicizing remained restricted to poetry until 1315, when Mussato wrote his first historical work in prose. Given the almost fifty-year lag between poetry and prose, the origins of Italian humanism are to be sought in developments in grammar and not rhetoric. For decades while prose remained captive to medieval forms, humanists found an outlet in poetry for their desire to emulate the ancient Romans. Those were the principal conclusions that I had reached by 1988, and until 1993 I thought of expanding my article into a comprehen36 Francesco Novati, Le origini, continuate e compiute da Angelo Monteverdi (Milan, 1926), 64749, vividly describes the povertà and esilità artistica of twelfth-century Italy. Much of the poetry that survives for the twelfth century is published by U. Ronca, Cultura medioevale e poesia latina dItalia nei secoli XI e XII, 2 vols. (Rome, 1892). See as well the comments of Kristeller, Humanism and Scholasticism, 27980, n. 47. 37 See n. 8, above. 38 Witt, Medieval Italian Culture, 4450, describes the nature of this French influence and its effect on various aspects of Italian intellectual life, including grammatical studies.\n\n18\n\nchapter one\n\nsive history of Latin culture in medieval Italy, leading into a study of the early development of Italian humanism. The project involved two volumes, the first filling out the narrative that I have sketched above from the Carolingian conquest to about 1250 and the second dealing with the evolution of humanism from 1250 to about 1420. By 1993, however, realizing that my study of humanism had an integrity of its own, and eager to publish my views, I set the larger project aside and concentrated on producing what would have been the second volume as a separate monograph. Current scholarship on Renaissance humanism generally begins the study of the movement with Petrarch, tending to dismiss the previous seventy years of humanistic endeavors as prehumanistic. Surprisingly, the massive reconstruction of the scholarly and literary achievements of the prehumanists since World War II by Roberto Weiss, Giuseppe and Guido Billanovich, and other scholars whose work appears in the key philological journal, Italia medioevale et umanistica, has done little to change that approach. Although those scholars have clearly shown that men like the Paduans, Lovato dei Lovati (1240/411309) and Albertino Mussato (12611329), shared scholarly and literary pursuits with Petrarch and had already made major advances in editing texts, in recovering lost ancient writings, and in developing a classicizing style, nonetheless, with the exception of Weiss, they have continued to label these ancestors of Petrarch prehumanists.39 Weiss alone claimed them as humanists, but, while Evidence of this tendency is found in the few references to pre-Petrarchan humanists found in Renaissance Humanism, an extensive survey of recent scholarship on the European Renaissance largely by American specialists. Examples of the tendency are found in Benjamin Kohl, Humanism and Education, 3:7; Danilo Aguzzi-Barbagli, Humanism and Poetics, 3:86; and John Monfasani, Humanism and Rhetoric, 3:176. Monfasani sets the phrase prehumanistic stage in parentheses when speaking of pre-Petrarchan humanism as if referring to a commonly understood term, not necessarily reflecting his own terminological preferences. General treatments of humanism vary. On the one hand, Donald R. Kelleys otherwise excellent Renaissance Humanism (Boston, 1991) begins the history of humanism with Petrarch, while, on the other, Charles Nauerts Humanism and the Culture of Renaissance Europe (Cambridge, 1995) treats both Lovato and Mussato as prehumanists. Italian scholars are prone to use the same terminology for humanism prior to Petrarch. Perhaps the best illustration of the practice is found in SCV 2, in which early humanism in the cities of the Veneto is consistently labelled prehumanistic. Guido Billanovich, who has done more than any other researcher to enhance Lovatos scholarly reputation, himself uses the term prehumanistic in characterizing early Paduan humanism in his important Il preumanesimo padovano, SCV 2:19110. He does not, however, define the term. 39\n\nintroduction\n\n19\n\ndrawing on the results of his research, most contemporary scholarship tends to ignore his conclusion.40 Moreover, Weiss did not see that his position required a reassessment of Petrarchs role in the movement. One of the questions I hope to answer is this: What role does Petrarch play in the history of humanism as a third-generation humanist? Oddly, the term prehumanist has almost never been defined by those who employ it, and when it has, the justification for using it seems strained. Perhaps the most extensive definition I have found is that given by Natalino Sapegno in 1960. In introducing a short section devoted to the Paduans, Lovato and Mussato, in his Il Trecento, he writes: It will not be out of place here to remember the prehumanists, the first fathers of that great cultural movement of which Boccaccio and Petrarch become its masters .... The prehumanists move in a still uncertain atmosphere; they advance as if unaware of their new attitude, even if some of them find themselves engaged in the first polemics against the defenders of antiquity.41\n\nAlthough these prehumanists are the first to engage in the defense of reading the ancient poets, nonetheless, they are unconscious of doing anything new. In them much more than in Petrarch and Boccaccio, one still sees the tie that attaches them to medieval civilization. They do not oppose it as much as advance a tendency, an impulse which, earlier left in shadow and now brought into the light and rendered substantial, will only 40 He did this specifically in The Dawn of Humanism in Italy (London, 1947); rpt. 1970). He provocatively entitled his essays devoted to various pre-Petrarcan humanists Il primo secolo dellumanesimo: Studi e testi, Storia e letteratura, 27 (Rome, 1949). Although Kristeller deals only cursorily in his writings with the earlier humanists, he basically endorses the position that I would characterize as that of the philologists: Petrarcas Stellung in der Geschichte der Gelehrsamkeit, 102: Ich ziehe es mit Roberto Weiss und anderen vor, sie als Humanisten gelten zu lassen, und Petrarca nicht als den ersten Humanisten anzusehen, sondern als den ersten grossen Humanisten .... In his important survey of Renaissance and Reformation European intellectual life, Donald Wilcox, In Search of God and Self: Renaissance and Reformation Thought (Boston, 1975), 59, recognizes the role of scholars of Mussatos generation in initiating the humanist movement, but he does not mention Lovato. 41 Il Trecento (Milan, 1960), 15152. The Italian text reads: ... non parrà strano ricordar qui i preumanisti, i primi padri di quel grande movimento di cultura, che nel Boccaccio stesso e nel Petrarca riconoscerà più tardi i suoi maestri. ... i preumanisti procedono in unatmosfera ancora incerta, avanzano quasi inconsapevoli della novità del loro atteggiamento, per quanto si ritrovino, alcuni di essi, a dover sostenere le prime polemiche contro i difensori dellantico.\n\n20\n\nchapter one slowly reveal its renovating power, its function as the yeast for modern civilization. In them in a more apparent and open way, the scholar sees the slow progress by which from grammatical studies, which had been the continuous patrimony of notaries, judges, and lawyers in preceding centuries, the appreciation of a greater and wiser culture slowly arose. That appreciation had to be revived in human souls through the painstaking conquest of its language and its art.42\n\nThe prehumanists are more medieval than Petrarch or Boccaccio because, although they all build on the same medieval grammatical studies, they are chronologically prior and correspondingly less appreciative of a greater and wiser culture. At this point Sapegno expands the ranks of prehumanists to include all those with grammatical interests over the previous two hundred years: Grammarians, teachers, notaries, jurists are indeed all representatives of prehumanism. 43 The term as a category loses any serious meaning. But, now, as if to reclaim the term specifically for Paduans, Sapegno concludes: And there is still, so to speak, something professional in their love of ancient poetry which is not found in Petrarch or Boccaccio. Nevertheless, this love is already alive and conscious in them. They have already recognized the profound separation between present civilization and the monumental one of Rome. It is this new animus which is really important in their work, beyond the external appearance, and even if the writings in which they tried to reproduce the spirits and forms of the great classical age remain for the most part quite distant from the great ideal of poetry to which they aspire, or rather, to speak more accurately, from any manner of poetry at all.44 42 The passage continues: In essi, assai più che nel Petrarca e nel Boccaccio, è visibile ancora il legame che li tiene attaccati alla civiltà medievale; alla quale non tanto si contrappongono, quanto piuttosto ne continuano una tendenza, un impulso altra volta rimasto in ombra, e che ora recato in piena luce e divenuto essenziale solo a poco a poco rivelerà la sua virtù rinnovatrice, la sua funzione di lievito nella moderna civiltà. In essi è meglio appariscente e si rivela più schietto allo studioso il lento processo per cui dagli studi grammaticali, che pur nei secoli precedenti eran stati patrimonio continuato dei maestri, dei notai, dei giudici, dei legisti, sorge a poco a poco la coscienza di una civiltà più grande e più saggia, che si deve far risorgere negli animi attraverso la conquista faticosa della sua lingua e della sua arte. 43 Grammatici e maestri, notai o giuristi sono appunto tutti i rappresentanti del preumanesimo. 44 E qualcosa, a dir così, di professionale è ancora nel loro amore della poesia antica, mentre non è già più in quello del Boccaccio e del Petrarca. Pur tuttavia questo amore è già in essi assai vivo e cosciente, e raggiunta ormai la consapevolezza del distacco profondo tra la civiltà presente e quella grandissima di Roma. E questo animus nuovo è quello che veramente importa nella loro opera, al di là dell apparenza esteriore, e anche se gli scritti nei quali essi si sforzarono di riprodurre gli\n\nintroduction\n\n21\n\nApart from the unexplained qualification of their poetry containing something professional, Sapegno now seems bent on ascribing to the Paduans self-conscious humanist attitudes. If all that those who employ the term prehumanist mean is that these men were predecessors of Petrarch, then I have no quarrel with them. The chronological priority of the Paduans is indisputable. Ignoring their status as humanists by beginning the movement with Petrarch, however, distorts both their role and that of Petrarch himself. Only when the latter is seen as a third-generation humanist can his enormous contribution to humanism  indeed, his single-handed rerouting of the movement  be appreciated. Against the backdrop of this new interpretation of Trecento humanism, Quattrocento civic humanism will assume a new aspect as well. I have endeavored in the early chapters of this book to combine the results of contemporary research on early Latin humanism with that of literary scholars on vernacular literature. Although Italian researchers commonly work in both fields, the traditions of the two have tended to militate against the formation of a composite picture of the Latin and vernacular cultures of late Duecento and early Trecento Italy. It was not a coincidence that Brunetto Latini undertook his first Tuscan translation of Ciceros works and that Lovato wrote his first Latin poetry in the 1260s. Their work reflected different responses to a similar, deeply felt need on the part of Italian intellectuals for closer ties with their ancient Roman inheritance. A brief analysis of the interplay between Tuscan vernacular and humanist writings in the century from 1250 to 1350 will serve to illuminate both linguistic traditions.45 I should say parenthetically that my analysis is limited to the portion of Italy north of Rome. Largely independent of the Carolingian empire, the south developed in the Middle Ages in a different way from the northern half of the peninsula, and generalizations made about northern and central Italian intellectual and cultural life usually do not fit conditions in the south. In what follows, I have chosen to place more emphasis than is spiriti e le forme della grande età classica rimangono per lo più assai lontani da quellideale di poesia, cui essi aspirano, lontani anzi, a dir meglio, da una maniera qualsiasi di poesia. 45 I suggest that the parallel relationship in the development of Latin and vernacular literature after Petrarch and down to the second half of the fifteenth century is reflected in their common focus on prose writing to the neglect of poetry.\n\n22\n\nchapter one\n\nusual in accounts of humanism on changes in Latin prose style as prime gauges of the evolution of the movement from Lovatos to Brunis generation. In choosing to do so, I am taking up where Trecento and Quattrocento humanists themselves left off. When authors from Salutati to Sabellico wrote the history of the movement, they largely focused on the progressive mastery of ancient Latin style from one generation to another. In my own account, however, I have no intention of ignoring the multidimensional character of humanistic activity, especially the increasing sophistication of humanists historical and philological research, together with their ethical and religious concerns  those aspects of humanism that occupy most of the attention of current scholarship. My decision to center my discussion of humanism on stylistic change derives not from an antiquarian loyalty to the earliest approaches, but rather from my conviction that a litmus for identifying a humanist was his intention to imitate ancient Latin style. At the least, a dedication to stylistic imitation initiated the destabilization of an authors own linguistic universe through his contact with that of antiquity. As a consequence, I do not regard as humanists those contemporaries who were engaged in historical and philological research on ancient culture but who showed no sign of seeking to emulate ancient style, but rather I consider them antiquarians. When a humanist set out to imitate ancient style, he confronted ancient models that evoked in him certain sympathies and antipathies. The experience of confrontation served, on the one hand, to locate the pagan texts at a remote distance in the past, and, on the other, to render the mentality of the ancients to some degree accessible to the imitators. The push and pull between the experience of the text as simultaneously both remote and familiar resulted in a progressive reconstruction of antiquity as a cultural alternative, bringing into relief the character of the humanists own world and revealing the historically contingent nature of both societies. 46 Imposed upon the past, the resultant historicizing of experience, while enhancing the imitability of the pagan writers by making them more human, also problematized their authority for the same reason. Projected\n\n46 The phrase cultural alternative is borrowed from Thomas M. Greene, The Light in Troy: Imitation and Discovery in Renaissance Poetry (New Haven and London, 1982), 90.\n\nintroduction\n\n23\n\nforward, historical perspective pointed to a future replete with possibilities and encouraged human efforts at reform.47 The early humanists desire to imitate the ancients also effected intellectual and attitudinal changes in the humanists themselves. Concerned with the transformative influence of the direct encounter with the ancients, Kenneth Gouwens has highlighted the importance of the dialogue with antiquity in the construction of a new sense of historical perspective as well as a new kind of self-awareness. He has also noted in a general way the effects that imitation of ancient concepts, styles, categories, and vocabularies had on the humanists cognitive processes.48 In this work, I intend to develop the latter observation by showing in detail how the humanists tireless study of ancient vocabulary and syntax and their struggle to capture the eloquent diction of the classical authors not only unlocked the mentality of those authors, but also nourished new linguistic patterns conditioning the humanists ways of feeling and thinking.49 No humanist demonstrated an awareness of the pervasive influence of imitation on his thought processes better than Francesco Petrarch, who, after years of studying the pagan writers intensely, described his relationship to them in this way:\n\n47 Gouwens, Perceiving the Past, 7677, speaks of the relation of the humanists with the past as dialogic and stresses the importance of this relationship for the humanists personal growth. In doing so, he draws on the insights of Jerome Brunner, The Culture of Education (Cambridge, Mass. and London, 1996), 62: ... there is something special about talking to authors, now dead but still alive in their ancient texts  so long as the objective of the encounter is not worship but discourse and interpretation, going meta on thoughts about the past. 48 Gouwens, Perceiving the Past, 64 and 67. Gouwens is also anxious to recognize a more comprehensive re-creation of ancient culture on the part of the humanists in that they incorporated ancient culture into their daily lives. For this purpose he specifically discusses the role of ancient culture in the recreational activity of Roman humanists around 1500. For a general bibliography on cognitive psychology, see Gouwens, 5556. 49 The influence of Michael Baxandalls Giotto and the Orators: Humanist Observers of Painting in Italy and the Discovery of Pictorial Composition (Oxford, 1971) on my thesis that style exercised a formative influence on humanist thinking will be obvious throughout this book. His view that the imitation of ancient Latin style effected a reorganization of consciousness in the humanists (6) strikes me, however, as leaning too much toward linguistic determinism. The theory that grammatical models fully determine the formulation and expression of human thought is better known as the WhorfSapir hypothesis. See the classic article, Language, Thought, and Reality, in Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf, ed. John B. Carroll (Cambridge, 1973), 24670.\n\n24\n\nchapter one They have become absorbed into my being and implanted not only in my memory but in the marrow of my bones and have become one with my mind so that even if I never read them [Virgil, Horace, Boethius, and Cicero] again in my life, they would inhere in me with their roots sunk in the depths of my soul.50\n\nStylistic demands never exerted a pre-emptive influence on thought processes.51 A notable difference existed in this regard, however, before and after 1400. In the earlier years, when humanists consciously avoided imitating any one ancient author, they borrowed idiosyncratically from a wide variety of pagan and Christian authors down at least to Augustine, with the result that the cognitive impact was modified by the fragmentary character of the imitative process. After 1400, however, the focus on Ciceros style significantly limited a writers options. Although humanists in the early fifteenth century did not depend slavishly on the Ciceronian model, nonetheless, their enshrining of Cicero as the basic model for eloquent prose meant that writers were forced into constant one-to-one negotiation with his linguistic constructions and lexicon. Years of training oneself to filter ideas through a Ciceronian linguistic grid would ultimately effect how the humanists thought and felt. In their negotiations with the ancients, the first five generations of humanists reveal what may be called an anxiety of influence.52 While humanists all sought originality in their literary work and, beginning with Petrarch, held that style was a key reflection of personality, they also nonetheless felt driven to bolster their own authority as writers by using a classicizing style and citing ancient authors frequently. In practice, the process of conscious selection that the humanists developed as they bargained with antiquity had real limits. Those limits were set by a variety of factors, including the allurement that ancient Latin diction exerted and the impossibility of identifying all the ingredients in the model that were to be brought over in the act 50 Petrarch, Rerum familiarium XXII.2, in Familiari 4:106: Hec se michi tam familiariter ingessere et non modo memorie sed medulis affixa sunt unumque cum ingenio facta sunt meo. ut etsi per omnem vitam amplius non legantur, ipsa quidem hereant, actis in intima animi parte radicibus. Translation mine. 51 Conceptual and linguistic systems are not monolithic; alternatives are possible within the systems. See, George Lakoff, Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind (Chicago and London, 1990), 335, for bibliography. 52 The phrase is Harold Blooms: see his The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry, 2nd ed. (New York, 1997).\n\nintroduction\n\n25\n\nof imitation. With classical modes of expression sunk, to paraphrase Petrarch, in the depths of their soul, ways of formulating thought became ways of thinking. To attribute such a creative, constructive role to style is to recognize its potential for illuminating every other aspect of humanist activity.53 Stylistic imitation in poetry and prose took a variety of forms. 54 (1) Imitation of genre. The advent of humanism can be traced to the late 1260s, when the first Latin lyrical poetry was written in Italy since antiquity. Early in the Trecento, pastoral poetry reappeared, and the ancient conception of the private letter revived. For centuries, the manuals of ars dictaminis had not distinguished the private letter from the official letter in form or tone. By the end of the fourteenth century, humanists began to reconceive oration along lines set out in the Ad Herennium and De inventione. (2) Imitation of technique. Medieval grammarians and rhetoricians read the same ancient manuals of rhetoric and exploited the same ancient arsenal of colores rhetorici as the humanists did. Medieval writers, however, often employed rhetorical colors to an extreme degree, whereas the early humanists, controlling their use of colores, more nearly approached ancient practice. They revived the simile, which had been neglected by medieval poets, and, by the 1360s, following the Ad Herennium, they introduced ekphrasis (description) in their orations. Trecento prose writers differed in their approach to the mediStrikingly, all the current interest in rhetoric as a way of thought and method of argumentation has done little to alter scorn for stylistic matters. Many scholars seem unable to overcome the prejudice that elocutio is merely ornamental. 54 On the concept of mimesis as an artistic imitation of reality. see Richard McKeon, Literary Criticism and the Concept of Imitation in Antiquity, Modern Philology 34 (1936): 135, and rpt. in Critics and Criticism: Ancient and Modern, ed. R.S. Crane (Chicago, 1952), 11745; Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: the Representation of Reality in Western Literature (Princeton, 1953); Hermann Koller, Die Mimesis in der Antike: Nachahmung, Darstellung, Ausdruck (Berne, 1954); Mimesis: From Mirror to Method: Augustine to Descartes, ed. John D. Lyons and Stephen G. Nichols (Hanover, N.H., 1982); and Ann Vasaly, Representations: Images of the World in Ciceronian Oratory (Berkeley, 1993). For mimesis as a technique of literary creativity, see the summary article by Wilhelm Kroll, Rhetorik, Paulys Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, suppl. 7 (Stuttgart, 1940), cols. 111317; and his Studien zum Verständnis der römischen Literatur (Stuttgart, 1924), 1478. General discussions of creative imitation in the Renaissance are found in Hermann Gmelin, Das Prinzip der Imitatio in den romanischen Literaturen der Renaissance, Romanische Forschungen 46 (1932): 83360; and Greene, The Light in Troy. For difficulties in detecting imitation, see Johannes Schneider, Die Vita Heinrici IV und Sallust: Studien zu Stil und Imitatio in der mittellateinischen Prosa, Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin. Schriften der Sektion für Altertumswissenschaft, 49 (Berlin, 1965), 614. 53\n\n26\n\nchapter one\n\neval cursus, that is the rules for using accentual meter to lend rhythm to the lines. While most humanist prose writers in the Trecento ceased to use it in other genres of composition, humanists throughout the century generally continued to observe the cursus in letter writing. Even Bruni in the early Quattrocento could not break entirely with the medieval tradition of writing in cursus. (3) Imitation of style.55 a. Sacramental imitation. This form of imitation, involving the literal citation of the ancient text in the humanists composition, constituted a minimal gesture in the direction of the model. In this case, the ancient original was merely appropriated as a sacred utterance, formally perfect and free of historical contingency because untranslatable in any other words. To the extent that an author treated the subtext liturgically, he short-circuited the potential reciprocity inherent in stylistic imitation, by ignoring the contingent character of the subtext in favor of affirming its status as an eternal exemplar. b. Exploitative (reproductive) imitation. Common to all humanist poetry, this approach to imitation involved employing a variety of ancient sources in the form of echoes, images, or phrases in the poems fabric. Against the complex pagan matrix, the new poem defined its own identity while admitting or rather proclaiming its loyalty to its antecedents. Having grasped the contingent and malleable character of his subtexts, the humanist poet demonstrated his mastery by evoking associations with the ancient works while establishing his own voice. c. Heuristic imitation. In this form of imitation, the author established a reciprocal relationship between his composition and a single parallel text or a succession of texts. Because the resulting dialogue\n\n55 Greene, Light in Troy, 3845, provides a brilliant analysis of Petrarchs Latin and vernacular poetry based on a hierarchy of categories arranged so as to emphasize progressively the intimate presence of the ancient subtext in the humanists composition and the degrees of reciprocity between the two texts. He suggests four levels of imitation  sacramental, exploitative (reproductive), heuristic, and dialectical  the last of which I have not found in the early humanists. Dialectical imitation occurs most commonly in parodic compositions, where mood, tone, and intention may be diametrically opposed to those of the original text. Thus, the work asserts maximum independence for itself while insisting on its indebtedness to the ancient model. The fortune of this mode of interpretation lay in the future, with such writers as Erasmus and Scarron. The first three forms of stylistic imitation are taken from Greene.\n\nintroduction\n\n27\n\nwas simplified by the sustained presence of only two voices (although the relationship might occasionally be interrupted by momentary echoes of others), the reader, aware of the subtext, took delight in a familiar presence. Through heuristic imitation, the humanist author underlined the originality of his own composition in contradistinction to the ancient model. Imitation highlighted the temporal distance between the humanists work and the model. Each was seen as an historically contingent human creation. d. Generic imitation. While successful heuristic imitation was a sure way of acquiring the aura of antiquity that humanist writers sought, it is important to stress that such imitation occurred infrequently in poetry and rarely in prose. By contrast, the other two kinds of imitation, sacral and reproductive, which were preferred by the early humanists in both prose and verse, were also favored by medieval writers, who seldom achieved a classicizing effect. Instead, classicizing in humanist compositions, while deriving in part from literal citation and echoes of a variety of ancient texts, rested primarily on rhythm or meter, word choice, syntax, disciplined use of figures, and, in the case of prose, sentence structure.56 Imitation of such elements provided the formal context that lent classical color to allusions and provided congenial settings for direct citations of ancient authors. Because such imitation rarely took as subtext a single original or a succession of them, even when a specific author was acting as a model, I have called this variety of imitation generic. While not establishing the kind of stylistic intimacy between author and ancient model afforded the successful heuristic imitation, the generic imitator had still to situate himself in relation to a pagan author or authors if he intended to invoke an ancient presence in what he wrote. In the following analysis, most cases of imitation that we shall consider, whether successful or less so, represent efforts to capture the generic\n\n56 Morris Croll, Style, Rhetoric and Rhythm: Essays by Morris W. Croll, ed. M. Patrick, R. Evans, with H. M. Wallace and R.J. Schoeck (Princeton, 1966), 3233, representing discussions on Attic and Asian prose among ancient Latin writers and their seventeenth-century descendants, emphasizes the formal aspects distinguishing the two styles. In one of the loci classici of ancient Latin stylistic analyses (Epist. ad Lucillum, 84), Seneca discussed contemporary stylistic practices on the basis of lexicon, metaphorical usage, and sentence arrangement, together with the consequences for rhythm and clarity.\n\n28\n\nchapter one\n\nclassicizing effect that Poggio Bracciolini referred to as vetustas, by which he meant the flavor of antiquity.57 I have used the term classicizing throughout the book to avoid having to discuss whether Renaissance authors themselves really wrote classical Latin. Modern classicists tend to identify as classical the elite political and literary language of a few writers belonging to the first century B.C.E. and the first and second centuries C.E. Pride of place is often assigned to Cicero, whose elaborate periodic sentences are conventionally acknowledged to display a craftsmanship seldom rivaled. Here I have accepted the standard notion of what constitutes classicism, complete with its tacit and not-so-tacit aesthetic judgments. I have not done so, however, simply from a desire to adhere to the received wisdom among todays appreciators of Latinity. Instead, I have tried to follow the standards of fifteenthcentury humanists themselves, standards that emerged as humanism developed and that, once established, were passed down to todays classicists largely unchanged. The current project has occupied me in one way or another for the past twenty years. I have proceeded by endeavoring to immerse myself in the written culture produced in northern and central Italy from the twelfth through the fifteenth century. It was a world that to begin with had no single, dominant language of literary composition and no single set of literary standards. Nor was there one Latin: different genres of composition followed different rules. By the late fifteenth century, however, thanks to the humanists, a set of standards for Latin composition had emerged; across genres, classicizing was now the norm. In the fourteenth century, humanism had been a scholarly, literary movement that involved a few members of lay 57 Although Poggios letter is lost, Salutatis response, defending the quality of Petrarchs Latin against the younger mans attacks, makes it clear that Poggio invoked vetustas or, as I understand the word, the flavor of antiquity, as a general term encompassing his aesthetic ideal of Latin style: Salutati, Epist., 4:131 and 134. Mussato had used the term earlier in the same sense. In his dedication of the Historia augusta to Henry VII, Mussato writes that he hesitated for a long time before daring to compose his history dum plurimum decertasset cum ratione voluntas. Ratio siquidem et tui sublimitatem, et rerum magnitudinem contemplabatur, quibus aequanda fuerat verborum, sermonumque vetustas: RIS 10, col. 9. I have not found the word used in antiquity in connection with style. The many ancient associations of vetustas with wine, however, may have inspired the usage: cf. Cic., Sen., 18.65; Cato, R.R., 114.2; and Columella, 3.2.1920. The word will be used in Poggios sense in the following chapters.\n\nintroduction\n\n29\n\nprofessions. In the fifteenth, it became the foundation for the educational program of the Italian upper classes. It so happens that I think that classicized Latin is good Latin, and I have made no concerted effort in the book to conceal that fact. My historical argument, however, does not depend on my aesthetic allegiances. I would certainly be the last to deny that my sense of what constitutes good Latin is historically contingent. Indeed, this study has made me more aware than I was before of the historical connections between the values, not just of todays classicists, but todays academics in general and the values of our humanist forebears. I do not deny that innumerable writers of medieval Latin may have wielded a language that admirably served their own cultural goals. Their goals, however, are not ours, whereas the humanists, in important ways, are. We also share values. Like the humanists, for example, we regard issues of individual and societal reform as urgent, favor secular over supernatural arguments, and take a critical stance toward the authorities whom we cite. Historians in particular share with the humanists an awareness of historical contingency and of humans multifaceted experience of historical time. Even postmodern scholars seeking to liberate themselves from Enlightenment (and Renaissance) paradigms are carrying forward, in a radical way, a project that began anew with the humanists: being skeptical about texts. Part of what makes the study of the humanists exciting is our complicity with them: in significant ways, we  and here I do not mean people of European extraction but rather every academic in any university anywhere  are their inheritors. That studying our own forebears presents theoretical challenges is something that I do not deny, but I am neither inclined to indulge in lengthy theorizing nor professionally trained to do so. Instead, I have relied on close reading and thick description to construct what all readers, I trust, will acknowledge is a complex picture. The development of humanism is not a simple, linear process like climbing up a ladder. I envision it, rather, as the gradual development of a language game, a kind of aesthetic exercise among a few literati to begin with that in time became a broad-based movement with high aspirations and sweeping consequences. 58 If the Renaissance rediscovered the classi58 Although speaking of political languages, J.G.A.

While it would have been possible for me, in keeping with academic practice, to enhance my credibility among academics by assuming a posture of greater distance from my subject and pretending not to take sides, I have chosen to make my allegiances clear. To hide them would only have been to deepen my complicity, since the posture of self-distancing, too, is an aspect of our academic manners that we take from the humanists. Dealing as I have with the origins of the movement, I feel justified in ending my account with the first decades of the fifteenth century. Considered from the standpoint of stylistic change, whereas Lovatos first poetry marked the beginning of the movement, another phase in the history of humanism, oratorical humanism, more precisely designated as the first Ciceronianism, began immediately after 1400. Because of the far-reaching consequences of the new aesthetic goals pursued by the generation of humanists coming to maturity in the first quarter of the fifteenth century, we may confidently affirm that the period of early humanism had by then concluded. The study closes with a brief survey of the work of the fifth generation.\n\nLanguage, and Time: Essays on Political Thought and History (New York, 1971), 21, provides a definition that applies here. He defines languages as ways of talking ..., distinguishable language games of which each may have its own vocabulary, rules, preconditions and implications, tone and style.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE BIRTH OF THE NEW AESTHETIC The renewed interest in Latin grammar and literature by 1190, after a century of neglect, could not by itself have led to the birth of Italian humanism.1 Nonetheless, the early Italian humanists would not have I deal extensively with the decades following the struggle over investiture in my The Two Cultures of Medieval Italy, 8001250 (forthcoming). See also my brief characterization of the period in my Medieval Italian Culture and the Origins of Humanism as a Stylistic Ideal, in Renaissance Humanism: Foundations, Forms, and Legacy, ed. Albert Rabil, 3 vols. (Philadelphia, 1988), 1:42. Because commentaries on ancient authors were intimately connected with the formal teaching of their work, the popularity of a particular author can be gauged by the number of surviving commentaries and accessus to his work. B. Munk Olsen, LEtude des auteurs classiques latins aux IXe et XIIe siècles, 3 vols. in 4 (Paris, 198289), devotes the first two volumes of his study to an inventory of Latin manuscripts of most of the literary writings of ancient Latin authors, along with c"
