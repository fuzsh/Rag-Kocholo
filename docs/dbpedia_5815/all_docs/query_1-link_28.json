        "text": "Caffetteria\n\nJoin us in the mornings in our caffeteria for Coperaco's organic blend espresso and a selection of drip coffees and organic teas. Sample one of the housemade pastries such as classic Italian bomboloni or try any of the sumptuous cakes, pastries or cookies. Don't miss our wonderful breakfast offerings: baked eggs with porchetta, housemade yogurt and granola with seasonal fruit, or the more savory torta pasqualina or tortilla spagnola served with our fresh baked breads. Come in for a midday pizza bianca with thin sliced mortadella or salumi rosso. By noon, the coffee bar morphs into a classic wine bar, serving savory snacks, beer and wine on tap as well as our selection of wines and spirits.\n\nPanetteria\n\nTucked beneath the bustling restaurant and marketplace, our bread program is always working to create new and innovative recipes utilizing the best sourced ancient and organic grains grown locally and from Sicily. Leading il Buco Alimentari & Vineria’s artisan bread program, Head Baker Sheena Otto, bakes all breads for both of our restaurants as well as the Alimentari counter. In addition to il Buco’s classic breads like ciabatta, focaccia fino and filone, Sheena has added her own specialty breads to the menu, including a naturally fermented Buckwheat Rye - made with Anson Mills Rye - a Bourbon Raisin Fennel bread and a flavorful Multigrain loaf with pumpkin, sunflower, sesame and flax seeds. Sheena’s passion for creating delicious and sustainable foods with the highest quality ingredients aligns perfectly with the ethos of il Buco Alimentari & Vineria.\n\n“If you’re going to pay all this attention to your product…you might as well use the best ingredients.” – Sheena Otto\n\nGelateria\n\nThe front counter houses a vast selection of housemade gelatos from our Pastry Chef. Our flavors change weekly with options such as salted caramel, chocolate and Meyer lemon, as well as a selection of seasonal fruit sorbets. French doors open with the warm weather for direct access to the gelato counter!"
