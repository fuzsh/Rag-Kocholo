        "text": "The molecular and cellular basis of health in human tendons remains poorly understood. Among human tendons, hamstring tendon has markedly low pathology and can provide a prototypic healthy tendon reference. The aim of this study was to determine the transcriptomes and location of all cell types in healthy hamstring tendon. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of 10 533 nuclei from four healthy donors and identified 12 distinct cell types. We confirmed the presence of two fibroblast cell types, endothelial cells, mural cells, and immune cells, and identified cell types previously unreported in tendons, including different skeletal muscle cell types, satellite cells, adipocytes, and undefined nervous system cells. The location of these cell types within tendon was defined using spatial transcriptomics and imaging, and potential transcriptional networks and cell-cell interactions were analyzed. We demonstrate that fibroblasts have the highest number of potential cell-cell interactions in our dataset, are present throughout the tendon, and play an important role in the production and organization of extracellular matrix, thus confirming their role as key regulators of hamstring tendon homeostasis. Overall, our findings underscore the complexity of the cellular networks that underpin healthy human tendon function and the central role of fibroblasts as key regulators of hamstring tendon tissue homeostasis.\n\nThe placenta is a selective maternal-fetal barrier that provides nourishment and protection from infections. However, certain pathogens can attach to and even cross the placenta, causing pregnancy complications with potential lifelong impacts on the child's health. Here, we profiled at the single-cell level the placental responses to three pathogens associated with intrauterine complications-Plasmodium falciparum, Listeria monocytogenes, and Toxoplasma gondii. We found that upon exposure to the pathogens, all placental lineages trigger inflammatory responses that may compromise placental function. Additionally, we characterized the responses of fetal macrophages known as Hofbauer cells (HBCs) to each pathogen and propose that they are the probable niche for T. gondii. Finally, we revealed how P. falciparum adapts to the placental microenvironment by modulating protein export into the host erythrocyte and nutrient uptake pathways. Altogether, we have defined the cellular networks and signaling pathways mediating acute placental inflammatory responses that could contribute to pregnancy complications.\n\nHere we use single-cell RNA sequencing to compile a human breast cell atlas assembled from 55 donors that had undergone reduction mammoplasties or risk reduction mastectomies. From more than 800,000 cells we identified 41 cell subclusters across the epithelial, immune and stromal compartments. The contribution of these different clusters varied according to the natural history of the tissue. Age, parity and germline mutations, known to modulate the risk of developing breast cancer, affected the homeostatic cellular state of the breast in different ways. We found that immune cells from BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers had a distinct gene expression signature indicative of potential immune exhaustion, which was validated by immunohistochemistry. This suggests that immune-escape mechanisms could manifest in non-cancerous tissues very early during tumor initiation. This atlas is a rich resource that can be used to inform novel approaches for early detection and prevention of breast cancer.\n\nThe emergence of retinal progenitor cells and differentiation to various retinal cell types represent fundamental processes during retinal development. Herein, we provide a comprehensive single cell characterisation of transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes that underline retinal progenitor cell specification and differentiation over the course of human retinal development up to midgestation. Our lineage trajectory data demonstrate the presence of early retinal progenitors, which transit to late, and further to transient neurogenic progenitors, that give rise to all the retinal neurons. Combining single cell RNA-Seq with spatial transcriptomics of early eye samples, we demonstrate the transient presence of early retinal progenitors in the ciliary margin zone with decreasing occurrence from 8 post-conception week of human development. In retinal progenitor cells, we identified a significant enrichment for transcriptional enhanced associate domain transcription factor binding motifs, which when inhibited led to loss of cycling progenitors and retinal identity in pluripotent stem cell derived organoids.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.\n\nSkeletal muscle aging is a key contributor to age-related frailty and sarcopenia with substantial implications for global health. Here we profiled 90,902 single cells and 92,259 single nuclei from 17 donors to map the aging process in the adult human intercostal muscle, identifying cellular changes in each muscle compartment. We found that distinct subsets of muscle stem cells exhibit decreased ribosome biogenesis genes and increased CCL2 expression, causing different aging phenotypes. Our atlas also highlights an expansion of nuclei associated with the neuromuscular junction, which may reflect re-innervation, and outlines how the loss of fast-twitch myofibers is mitigated through regeneration and upregulation of fast-type markers in slow-twitch myofibers with age. Furthermore, we document the function of aging muscle microenvironment in immune cell attraction. Overall, we present a comprehensive human skeletal muscle aging resource ( https://www.muscleageingcellatlas.org/ ) together with an in-house mouse muscle atlas to study common features of muscle aging across species.\n\nClustering and visualization are essential parts of single-cell gene expression data analysis. The Euclidean distance used in most distance-based methods is not optimal. The batch effect, i.e., the variability among samples gathered from different times, tissues, and patients, introduces large between-group distance and obscures the true identities of cells. To solve this problem, we introduce Label-Aware Distance (LAD), a metric using temporal/spatial locality of the batch effect to control for such factors. We validate LAD on simulated data as well as apply it to a mouse retina development dataset and a lung dataset. We also found the utility of our approach in understanding the progression of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). LAD provides better cell embedding than state-of-the-art batch correction methods on longitudinal datasets. It can be used in distance-based clustering and visualization methods to combine the power of multiple samples to help make biological findings.\n\nPeriodontitis affects billions of people worldwide. To address relationships of periodontal niche cell types and microbes in periodontitis, we generated an integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) atlas of human periodontium (34-sample, 105918-cell), including sulcular and junctional keratinocytes (SK/JKs). SK/JKs displayed altered differentiation states and were enriched for effector cytokines in periodontitis. Single-cell metagenomics revealed 37 bacterial species with cell-specific tropism. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected intracellular 16 S and mRNA signals of multiple species and correlated with SK/JK proinflammatory phenotypes in situ. Cell-cell communication analysis predicted keratinocyte-specific innate and adaptive immune interactions. Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (33-antibody) revealed peri-epithelial immune foci, with innate cells often spatially constrained around JKs. Spatial phenotyping revealed immunosuppressed JK-microniches and SK-localized tertiary lymphoid structures in periodontitis. Here, we demonstrate impacts on and predicted interactomics of SK and JK cells in health and periodontitis, which requires further investigation to support precision periodontal interventions in states of chronic inflammation.\n\nThe complexity of the tumor microenvironment poses significant challenges in cancer therapy. Here, to comprehensively investigate the tumor-normal ecosystems, we perform an integrative analysis of 4.9 million single-cell transcriptomes from 1070 tumor and 493 normal samples in combination with pan-cancer 137 spatial transcriptomics, 8887 TCGA, and 1261 checkpoint inhibitor-treated bulk tumors. We define a myriad of cell states constituting the tumor-normal ecosystems and also identify hallmark gene signatures across different cell types and organs. Our atlas characterizes distinctions between inflammatory fibroblasts marked by AKR1C1 or WNT5A in terms of cellular interactions and spatial co-localization patterns. Co-occurrence analysis reveals interferon-enriched community states including tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) components, which exhibit differential rewiring between tumor, adjacent normal, and healthy normal tissues. The favorable response of interferon-enriched community states to immunotherapy is validated using immunotherapy-treated cancers (n = 1261) including our lung cancer cohort (n = 497). Deconvolution of spatial transcriptomes discriminates TLS-enriched from non-enriched cell types among immunotherapy-favorable components. Our systematic dissection of tumor-normal ecosystems provides a deeper understanding of inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity.\n\nWe introduce GRouNdGAN, a gene regulatory network (GRN)-guided reference-based causal implicit generative model for simulating single-cell RNA-seq data, in silico perturbation experiments, and benchmarking GRN inference methods. Through the imposition of a user-defined GRN in its architecture, GRouNdGAN simulates steady-state and transient-state single-cell datasets where genes are causally expressed under the control of their regulating transcription factors (TFs). Training on six experimental reference datasets, we show that our model captures non-linear TF-gene dependencies and preserves gene identities, cell trajectories, pseudo-time ordering, and technical and biological noise, with no user manipulation and only implicit parameterization. GRouNdGAN can synthesize cells under new conditions to perform in silico TF knockout experiments. Benchmarking various GRN inference algorithms reveals that GRouNdGAN effectively bridges the existing gap between simulated and biological data benchmarks of GRN inference algorithms, providing gold standard ground truth GRNs and realistic cells corresponding to the biological system of interest.\n\nPalatine tonsils are secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) representing the first line of immunological defense against inhaled or ingested pathogens. We generated an atlas of the human tonsil composed of >556,000 cells profiled across five different data modalities, including single-cell transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, and immune repertoire sequencing, as well as spatial transcriptomics. This census identified 121 cell types and states, defined developmental trajectories, and enabled an understanding of the functional units of the tonsil. Exemplarily, we stratified myeloid slan-like subtypes, established a BCL6 enhancer as locally active in follicle-associated T and B cells, and identified SIX5 as putative transcriptional regulator of plasma cell maturation. Analyses of a validation cohort confirmed the presence, annotation, and markers of tonsillar cell types and provided evidence of age-related compositional shifts. We demonstrate the value of this resource by annotating cells from B cell-derived mantle cell lymphomas, linking transcriptional heterogeneity to normal B cell differentiation states of the human tonsil.\n\nThe human uterus is a complex and dynamic organ whose lining grows, remodels, and regenerates in every menstrual cycle or upon tissue damage. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more the 50,000 uterine cells from both the endometrium and myometrium of 5 healthy premenopausal individuals, and jointly analyzed the data with a previously published dataset from 15 subjects. The resulting normal uterus cell atlas contains more than 167K cells representing the lymphatic endothelium, blood endothelium, stromal, ciliated epithelium, unciliated epithelium, and immune cell populations. Focused analyses within each major cell type and comparisons with subtype labels from prior studies allowed us to document supporting evidence, resolve naming conflicts, and to propose a consensus annotation system of 39 subtypes. We release their gene expression centroids, differentially expressed genes, and mRNA patterns of literature-based markers as a shared community resource. We find many subtypes show dynamic changes over different phases of the cycle and identify multiple potential progenitor cells: compartment-wide progenitors for each major cell type, transitional cells that are upstream of other subtypes, and potential cross-lineage multipotent stromal progenitors that may be capable of replenishing the epithelial, stromal, and endothelial compartments. When compared to the healthy premenopausal samples, a postpartum and a postmenopausal uterus sample revealed substantially altered tissue composition, involving the rise or fall of stromal, endothelial, and immune cells. The cell taxonomy and molecular markers we report here are expected to inform studies of both basic biology of uterine function and its disorders.\n\nA broad range of brain pathologies critically relies on the vasculature, and cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. However, the cellular and molecular architecture of the human brain vasculature remains incompletely understood1. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 606,380 freshly isolated endothelial cells, perivascular cells and other tissue-derived cells from 117 samples, from 68 human fetuses and adult patients to construct a molecular atlas of the developing fetal, adult control and diseased human brain vasculature. We identify extensive molecular heterogeneity of the vasculature of healthy fetal and adult human brains and across five vascular-dependent central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including brain tumours and brain vascular malformations. We identify alteration of arteriovenous differentiation and reactivated fetal as well as conserved dysregulated genes and pathways in the diseased vasculature. Pathological endothelial cells display a loss of CNS-specific properties and reveal an upregulation of MHC class II molecules, indicating atypical features of CNS endothelial cells. Cell-cell interaction analyses predict substantial endothelial-to-perivascular cell ligand-receptor cross-talk, including immune-related and angiogenic pathways, thereby revealing a central role for the endothelium within brain neurovascular unit signalling networks. Our single-cell brain atlas provides insights into the molecular architecture and heterogeneity of the developing, adult/control and diseased human brain vasculature and serves as a powerful reference for future studies.\n\nSingle-nucleus analysis allows robust cell-type classification and helps to establish relationships between chromatin accessibility and cell-type-specific gene expression. Here, using samples from 92 women of several genetic ancestries, we developed a comprehensive chromatin accessibility and gene expression atlas of the breast tissue. Integrated analysis revealed ten distinct cell types, including three major epithelial subtypes (luminal hormone sensing, luminal adaptive secretory precursor (LASP) and basal-myoepithelial), two endothelial and adipocyte subtypes, fibroblasts, T cells, and macrophages. In addition to the known cell identity genes FOXA1 (luminal hormone sensing), EHF and ELF5 (LASP), TP63 and KRT14 (basal-myoepithelial), epithelial subtypes displayed several uncharacterized markers and inferred gene regulatory networks. By integrating breast epithelial cell gene expression signatures with spatial transcriptomics, we identified gene expression and signaling differences between lobular and ductal epithelial cells and age-associated changes in signaling networks. LASP cells and fibroblasts showed genetic ancestry-dependent variability. An estrogen receptor-positive subpopulation of LASP cells with alveolar progenitor cell state was enriched in women of Indigenous American ancestry. Fibroblasts from breast tissues of women of African and European ancestry clustered differently, with accompanying gene expression differences. Collectively, these data provide a vital resource for further exploring genetic ancestry-dependent variability in healthy breast biology.\n\nThe reproductive and endocrine functions of the ovary involve spatially defined interactions among specialized cell populations. Despite the ovary's importance in fertility and endocrine health, functional attributes of ovarian cells are largely uncharacterized. Here, we profiled >18,000 genes in 257 regions from the ovaries of two premenopausal donors to examine the functional units in the ovary. We also generated single-cell RNA sequencing data for 21,198 cells from three additional donors and identified four major cell types and four immune cell subtypes. Custom selection of sampling areas revealed distinct gene activities for oocytes, theca, and granulosa cells. These data contributed panels of oocyte-, theca-, and granulosa-specific genes, thus expanding the knowledge of molecular programs driving follicle development. Serial samples around oocytes and across the cortex and medulla uncovered previously unappreciated variation of hormone and extracellular matrix remodeling activities. This combined spatial and single-cell atlas serves as a resource for future studies of rare cells and pathological states in the ovary.\n\nAltered transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of brain cell types may contribute to cognitive changes with advanced age. Using single-nucleus multi-omic DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing (snmCT-seq) in frontal cortex from young adult and aged donors, we found widespread age- and sex-related variation in specific neuron types. The proportion of inhibitory SST- and VIP-expressing neurons was reduced in aged donors. Excitatory neurons had more profound age-related changes in their gene expression and DNA methylation than inhibitory cells. Hundreds of genes involved in synaptic activity, including EGR1, were less expressed in aged adults. Genes located in subtelomeric regions increased their expression with age and correlated with reduced telomere length. We further mapped cell-type-specific sex differences in gene expression and X-inactivation escape genes. Multi-omic single-nucleus epigenomes and transcriptomes provide new insight into the effects of age and sex on human neurons.\n\nIsolation of tissue-specific fetal stem cells and derivation of primary organoids is limited to samples obtained from termination of pregnancies, hampering prenatal investigation of fetal development and congenital diseases. Therefore, new patient-specific in vitro models are needed. To this aim, isolation and expansion of fetal stem cells during pregnancy, without the need for tissue samples or reprogramming, would be advantageous. Amniotic fluid (AF) is a source of cells from multiple developing organs. Using single-cell analysis, we characterized the cellular identities present in human AF. We identified and isolated viable epithelial stem/progenitor cells of fetal gastrointestinal, renal and pulmonary origin. Upon culture, these cells formed clonal epithelial organoids, manifesting small intestine, kidney tubule and lung identity. AF organoids exhibit transcriptomic, protein expression and functional features of their tissue of origin. With relevance for prenatal disease modeling, we derived lung organoids from AF and tracheal fluid cells of congenital diaphragmatic hernia fetuses, recapitulating some features of the disease. AF organoids are derived in a timeline compatible with prenatal intervention, potentially allowing investigation of therapeutic tools and regenerative medicine strategies personalized to the fetus at clinically relevant developmental stages.\n\nThe functional diversity of natural killer (NK) cell repertoires stems from differentiation, homeostatic, receptor-ligand interactions and adaptive-like responses to viral infections. In the present study, we generated a single-cell transcriptional reference map of healthy human blood- and tissue-derived NK cells, with temporal resolution and fate-specific expression of gene-regulatory networks defining NK cell differentiation. Transfer learning facilitated incorporation of tumor-infiltrating NK cell transcriptomes (39 datasets, 7 solid tumors, 427 patients) into the reference map to analyze tumor microenvironment (TME)-induced perturbations. Of the six functionally distinct NK cell states identified, a dysfunctional stressed CD56bright state susceptible to TME-induced immunosuppression and a cytotoxic TME-resistant effector CD56dim state were commonly enriched across tumor types, the ratio of which was predictive of patient outcome in malignant melanoma and osteosarcoma. This resource may inform the design of new NK cell therapies and can be extended through transfer learning to interrogate new datasets from experimental perturbations or disease conditions.\n\nHuman limbs emerge during the fourth post-conception week as mesenchymal buds, which develop into fully formed limbs over the subsequent months1. This process is orchestrated by numerous temporally and spatially restricted gene expression programmes, making congenital alterations in phenotype common2. Decades of work with model organisms have defined the fundamental mechanisms underlying vertebrate limb development, but an in-depth characterization of this process in humans has yet to be performed. Here we detail human embryonic limb development across space and time using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We demonstrate extensive diversification of cells from a few multipotent progenitors to myriad differentiated cell states, including several novel cell populations. We uncover two waves of human muscle development, each characterized by different cell states regulated by separate gene expression programmes, and identify musculin (MSC) as a key transcriptional repressor maintaining muscle stem cell identity. Through assembly of multiple anatomically continuous spatial transcriptomic samples using VisiumStitcher, we map cells across a sagittal section of a whole fetal hindlimb. We reveal a clear anatomical segregation between genes linked to brachydactyly and polysyndactyly, and uncover transcriptionally and spatially distinct populations of the mesenchyme in the autopod. Finally, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on mouse embryonic limbs to facilitate cross-species developmental comparison, finding substantial homology between the two species. Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, human embryonic limb development across space and time and the diversification and cross-species&nbsp;conservation&nbsp;of cells are demonstrated.\n\nAdvances in single-cell technologies have transformed the ability to identify the individual cell types present within tissues and organs. The musculoskeletal bionetwork, part of the wider Human Cell Atlas project, aims to&nbsp;create a detailed map of the healthy musculoskeletal system at a single-cell resolution throughout tissue development and across the human lifespan, with complementary generation of data from diseased tissues. Given the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, this detailed reference dataset will be critical to understanding normal musculoskeletal function in growth, homeostasis and ageing. The endeavour will also help to identify the cellular basis for disease and lay the foundations for novel therapeutic approaches to treating diseases of the joints, soft tissues and bone. Here, we present a Roadmap delineating the critical steps required to construct the first draft of a human musculoskeletal cell atlas. We describe the key challenges involved in mapping the extracellular matrix-rich, but cell-poor, tissues of the musculoskeletal system, outline early milestones that have been achieved and describe the vision and directions for a comprehensive musculoskeletal cell atlas. By embracing cutting-edge technologies, integrating diverse datasets and fostering international collaborations, this endeavour has the potential to drive transformative changes in musculoskeletal medicine. A single-cell atlas of the human musculoskeletal system could help to improve the understanding of musculoskeletal function in growth, homeostasis, ageing and disease. This Roadmap delineates the steps required and challenges involved in creating such an atlas.\n\nEnhanced cognitive function in humans is hypothesized to result from cortical expansion and increased cellular diversity. However, the mechanisms that drive these phenotypic innovations remain poorly understood, in part because of the lack of high-quality cellular resolution data in human and non-human primates. Here, we take advantage of single-cell expression data from the middle temporal gyrus of five primates (human, chimp, gorilla, macaque and marmoset) to identify 57 homologous cell types and generate cell type-specific gene co-expression networks for comparative analysis. Although orthologue expression patterns are generally well conserved, we find 24% of genes with extensive differences between human and non-human primates (3,383 out of 14,131), which are also associated with multiple brain disorders. To assess the functional significance of gene expression differences in an evolutionary context, we evaluate changes in network connectivity across meta-analytic co-expression networks from 19 animals. We find that a subset of these genes has deeply conserved co-expression across all non-human animals, and strongly divergent co-expression relationships in humans (139 out of 3,383, &lt;1% of primate orthologues). Genes with human-specific cellular expression and co-expression profiles (such as NHEJ1, GTF2H2, C2 and BBS5) typically evolve under relaxed selective constraints and may drive rapid evolutionary change in brain function. Analysis of single-cell expression data from the middle temporal gyrus of five primates together with analysis of network connectivity across 19 animals identifies genes with human-specific cellular expression and co-expression profiles that might contribute to evolutionary change in brain function.\n\nSingle-cell omics technologies enable molecular characterization of diverse cell types and states, but how the resulting transcriptional and epigenetic profiles depend on the cell’s genetic background remains understudied. We describe Monopogen, a computational tool to detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) from single-cell sequencing data. Monopogen leverages linkage disequilibrium from external reference panels to identify germline SNVs and detects putative somatic SNVs using allele cosegregating patterns at the cell population level. It can identify 100 K to 3 M germline SNVs achieving a genotyping accuracy of 95%, together with hundreds of putative somatic SNVs. Monopogen-derived genotypes enable global and local ancestry inference and identification of admixed samples. It identifies variants associated with cardiomyocyte metabolic levels and epigenomic programs. It also improves putative somatic SNV detection that enables clonal lineage tracing in primary human clonal hematopoiesis. Monopogen brings together population genetics, cell lineage tracing and single-cell omics to uncover genetic determinants of cellular processes. Monopogen identifies single-nucleotide variants in single-cell sequencing data.\n\nUnderstanding kidney disease relies on defining the complexity of cell types and states, their associated molecular profiles and interactions within tissue neighbourhoods1. Here we applied multiple single-cell and single-nucleus assays (&gt;400,000 nuclei&nbsp;or&nbsp;cells) and spatial imaging technologies to a broad spectrum of healthy reference kidneys (45 donors) and diseased kidneys (48 patients). This has provided a high-resolution cellular atlas of 51 main cell types, which include rare and previously undescribed cell populations. The multi-omic approach provides detailed transcriptomic profiles, regulatory factors and spatial localizations spanning the entire kidney. We also define 28 cellular states across nephron segments and interstitium that were altered in kidney injury, encompassing cycling, adaptive (successful&nbsp;or maladaptive repair), transitioning and degenerative states. Molecular signatures permitted the localization of these states within injury neighbourhoods using spatial transcriptomics, while large-scale 3D imaging analysis (around 1.2 million neighbourhoods) provided corresponding linkages to active immune responses. These analyses defined biological pathways that are relevant to injury time-course and niches, including signatures underlying epithelial repair that predicted maladaptive states associated with a decline in kidney function. This integrated multimodal spatial cell atlas of healthy and diseased human kidneys represents a comprehensive benchmark of cellular states, neighbourhoods, outcome-associated signatures and publicly available interactive visualizations. A high-resolution kidney cellular atlas of 51 main cell types, including rare and previously undescribed cell populations, represents a comprehensive benchmark of cellular states, neighbourhoods, outcome-associated signatures and publicly available interactive visualizations.\n\nThe function of a cell is defined by its intrinsic characteristics and its niche: the tissue microenvironment in which it dwells. Here we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data to discover cellular niches within eight regions of the human heart. We map cells to microanatomical locations and integrate knowledge-based and unsupervised structural annotations. We also profile the cells of the human cardiac conduction system1. The results revealed their distinctive repertoire of ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors&nbsp;(GPCRs) and regulatory networks, and implicated FOXP2 in the pacemaker phenotype. We show that the sinoatrial node is compartmentalized, with a core of pacemaker cells, fibroblasts and glial cells supporting glutamatergic signalling. Using a custom CellPhoneDB.org module, we identify trans-synaptic pacemaker cell interactions with glia. We introduce a druggable target prediction tool, drug2cell, which leverages single-cell profiles and drug–target interactions to provide mechanistic insights into the chronotropic effects of drugs, including GLP-1 analogues. In the epicardium, we show enrichment of both IgG+ and IgA+ plasma cells forming immune niches that may contribute to infection defence. Overall, we provide new clarity to cardiac electro-anatomy and immunology, and our suite of computational approaches can be applied to other tissues and organs. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis of eight human heart&nbsp;tissues reveals the&nbsp;cellular profiles and tissue architecture of niches including the cardiac conduction system, and a new tool, drug2cell, identifies drug target expression.\n\nThe adult human breast&nbsp;is&nbsp;comprised of&nbsp;an intricate network of epithelial ducts and lobules that are embedded in connective and adipose tissue1–3. Although most previous studies have focused on the breast epithelial system4–6, many of the non-epithelial cell types remain understudied. Here we constructed the comprehensive Human Breast Cell Atlas (HBCA) at single-cell and spatial resolution. Our single-cell transcriptomics study profiled 714,331 cells from 126 women, and 117,346 nuclei from 20 women, identifying 12 major cell types and 58 biological cell states. These data reveal abundant perivascular, endothelial and immune cell populations, and highly diverse luminal epithelial cell states. Spatial mapping using four different technologies revealed an unexpectedly rich ecosystem of tissue-resident immune cells, as well as distinct molecular differences between ductal and lobular regions. Collectively, these data provide a reference of the adult normal breast tissue for studying mammary biology and diseases such as breast cancer. The Human Breast Cell Atlas identifies 12 major breast cell types and 58 biological cell states, revealing abundant pericyte, endothelial and immune cell populations, and highly diverse luminal epithelial cell states.\n\nSingle-cell technologies have transformed our understanding of human tissues. Yet, studies typically capture only a limited number of donors and disagree on cell type definitions. Integrating many single-cell datasets can address these limitations of individual studies and capture the variability present in the population. Here we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA), combining 49 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.4 million cells from 486 individuals. The HLCA presents a consensus cell type re-annotation with matching marker genes, including annotations of rare and previously undescribed cell types. Leveraging the number and diversity of individuals in the HLCA, we identify gene modules that are associated with demographic covariates such as age, sex and body mass index, as well as gene modules changing expression along the proximal-to-distal axis of the bronchial tree. Mapping new data to the HLCA enables rapid data annotation and interpretation. Using the HLCA as a reference for the study of disease, we identify shared cell states across multiple lung diseases, including SPP1+ profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages in COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma. Overall, the HLCA serves as an example for the development and use of large-scale, cross-dataset organ atlases within the Human Cell Atlas. A single-cell atlas of the human lungs, integrating data from 2.4 million cells from 486 individuals and including samples from healthy and diseased lungs, provides a roadmap for the generation of organ-scale cell atlases.\n\nThe number of studies investigating the human gastrointestinal tract using various single-cell profiling methods has increased substantially in the past few years. Although this increase provides a unique opportunity for the generation of the first comprehensive Human Gut Cell Atlas (HGCA), there remains a range of major challenges ahead. Above all, the&nbsp;ultimate success will largely depend on a structured and coordinated approach that aligns global efforts undertaken by a large number of research groups. In this Roadmap, we discuss a comprehensive forward-thinking direction for the generation of the HGCA on&nbsp;behalf of the Gut Biological Network of the Human Cell Atlas. Based on the consensus opinion of experts from across the globe, we outline the main requirements for the first complete HGCA by summarizing existing data sets and highlighting anatomical regions and/or tissues with limited coverage. We provide recommendations for future studies and discuss key methodologies and the importance of integrating the healthy gut atlas with related diseases and gut organoids. Importantly, we critically overview the computational tools available and provide recommendations to overcome key challenges. Single-cell profiling studies of the human gastrointestinal tract are increasing, offering an excellent opportunity to generate the first Human Gut Cell Atlas. This Roadmap presents a structured direction towards this goal and provides a detailed overview of the major challenges.\n\nAssessment of single-cell gene expression (single-cell RNA sequencing) and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) sequencing (scVDJ-seq) has been invaluable in studying lymphocyte biology. Here we introduce Dandelion, a computational pipeline for scVDJ-seq analysis. It enables the application of standard V(D)J analysis workflows to single-cell datasets, delivering improved V(D)J contig annotation and the identification of nonproductive and partially spliced contigs. We devised a strategy to create an AIR feature space that can be used for both differential V(D)J usage analysis and pseudotime trajectory inference. The application of Dandelion improved the alignment of human thymic development trajectories of double-positive T cells to mature single-positive CD4/CD8 T cells, generating predictions of factors regulating lineage commitment. Dandelion analysis of other cell compartments provided insights into the origins of human B1 cells and ILC/NK cell development, illustrating the power of our approach. Dandelion is available at https://www.github.com/zktuong/dandelion . A computational pipeline enables differential V(D)J usage analysis and pseudotime trajectory inference from single-cell AIR sequencing.\n\nThe relationship between the human placenta—the extraembryonic organ made by the fetus, and the decidua—the mucosal layer of the uterus, is essential to nurture and protect the fetus during pregnancy. Extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs) derived from placental villi&nbsp;infiltrate the decidua, transforming the maternal arteries into high-conductance vessels1. Defects in trophoblast invasion and arterial transformation established during early pregnancy underlie common pregnancy disorders such as pre-eclampsia2. Here we have generated a spatially resolved multiomics single-cell atlas of the entire human maternal–fetal interface including the myometrium, which enables us to resolve the full trajectory of trophoblast differentiation. We have used this cellular map to infer the possible transcription factors mediating EVT invasion and show that they are preserved in in vitro models of EVT differentiation from primary trophoblast organoids3,4 and trophoblast stem cells5. We define the transcriptomes of the final cell states of trophoblast invasion: placental bed giant cells (fused multinucleated EVTs) and endovascular EVTs (which form plugs inside the maternal arteries). We predict the cell–cell communication events contributing to trophoblast invasion and placental bed giant cell formation, and model the dual role of interstitial EVTs and endovascular EVTs in mediating arterial transformation during early pregnancy. Together, our data provide a comprehensive analysis of postimplantation trophoblast differentiation that can be used to inform the design of experimental models of the human placenta in early pregnancy. A multiomics single-cell atlas of the human maternal–fetal interface including the myometrium, combining spatial transcriptomics data with chromatin accessibility, provides a comprehensive analysis of cell states&nbsp;as placental cells infiltrate the uterus&nbsp;during early pregnancy.\n\nTransferring annotations of single-cell-, spatial- and multi-omics data is often challenging owing both to technical limitations, such as low spatial resolution or high dropout fraction, and to biological variations, such as continuous spectra of cell states. Based on the concept that these data are often best described as continuous mixtures of cells or molecules, we present a computational framework for the transfer of annotations to cells and their combinations (TACCO), which consists of an optimal transport model extended with different wrappers to annotate a wide variety of data. We apply TACCO to identify cell types and states, decipher spatiomolecular tissue structure at the cell and molecular level and resolve differentiation trajectories using synthetic and biological datasets. While matching or exceeding the accuracy of specialized tools for the individual tasks, TACCO reduces the computational requirements by up to an order of magnitude and scales to larger datasets (for example, considering the runtime of annotation transfer for 1 M simulated dropout observations). Annotation transfer from reference to new datasets is improved with a probabilistic approach.\n\nThe stomach is an important digestive organ with various biological functions. However, because of the complexity of its cellular and glandular composition, its precise cellular biology has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subcellular-level spatial transcriptomics analysis of the human stomach and constructed the largest dataset to date: a stomach encyclopedia. This dataset consists of approximately 380,000 cells from scRNA-seq and the spatial transcriptome, enabling integrated analyses of transcriptional and spatial information of gastric and metaplastic cells. This analysis identified LEFTY1 as an uncharacterized stem cell marker, which was confirmed through lineage tracing analysis. A wide variety of cell-cell interactions between epithelial and stromal cells, including PDGFRA+BMP4+WNT5A+ fibroblasts, was highlighted in the developmental switch of intestinal metaplasia. Our extensive dataset will function as a fundamental resource in investigations of the stomach, including studies of development, aging, and carcinogenesis.\n\nCommon genetic variants confer substantial risk for chronic lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Defining the genetic control of gene expression in a cell-type-specific and context-dependent manner is critical for understanding the mechanisms through which genetic variation influences complex traits and disease pathobiology. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of lung tissue from 67 PF and 49 unaffected donors. Employing a pseudo-bulk approach, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) across 38 cell types, observing both shared and cell type-specific regulatory effects. Further, we identified disease-interaction eQTL and demonstrated that this class of associations is more likely to be cell-type specific and linked to cellular dysregulation in PF. Finally, we connected PF risk variants to their regulatory targets in disease-relevant cell types. These results indicate that cellular context determines the impact of genetic variation on gene expression, and implicates context-specific eQTL as key regulators of lung homeostasis and disease.\n\nAccurate cell type identification is a key and rate-limiting step in single-cell data analysis. Single-cell references with comprehensive cell types, reproducible and functionally validated cell identities, and common nomenclatures are much needed by the research community for automated cell type annotation, data integration, and data sharing. Here, we develop a computational pipeline utilizing the LungMAP CellCards as a dictionary to consolidate single-cell transcriptomic datasets of 104 human lungs and 17 mouse lung samples to construct LungMAP single-cell reference (CellRef) for both normal human and mouse lungs. CellRefs define 48 human and 40 mouse lung cell types catalogued from diverse anatomic locations and developmental time points. We demonstrate the accuracy and stability of LungMAP CellRefs and their utility for automated cell type annotation of both normal and diseased lungs using multiple independent methods and testing data. We develop user-friendly web interfaces for easy access and maximal utilization of the LungMAP CellRefs.\n\nThe human airway contains specialized rare epithelial cells whose roles in respiratory disease are not well understood. Ionocytes express the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), while chemosensory tuft cells express asthma-associated alarmins. However, surprisingly, exceedingly few mature tuft cells have been identified in human lung cell atlases despite the ready identification of rare ionocytes and neuroendocrine cells. To identify human rare cell progenitors and define their lineage relationship to mature tuft cells, we generated a deep lung cell atlas containing 311,748 single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) profiles from discrete anatomic sites along the large and small airways and lung lobes of explanted donor lungs that could not be used for organ transplantation. Of 154,222 airway epithelial cells, we identified 687 ionocytes (0.45%) that are present in similar proportions in both large and small airways, suggesting that they may contribute to both large and small airways pathologies in CF. In stark contrast, we recovered only 3 mature tuft cells (0.002%). Instead, we identified rare bipotent progenitor cells that can give rise to both ionocytes and tuft cells, which we termed tuft-ionocyte progenitor cells (TIP cells). Remarkably, the cycling fraction of these TIP cells was comparable to that of basal stem cells. We used scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to predict transcription factors that mark this novel rare cell progenitor population and define intermediate states during TIP cell lineage transitions en route to the differentiation of mature ionocytes and tuft cells. The default lineage of TIP cell descendants is skewed towards ionocytes, explaining the paucity of mature tuft cells in the human airway. However, Type 2 and Type 17 cytokines, associated with asthma and CF, diverted the lineage of TIP cell descendants in vitro , resulting in the differentiation of mature tuft cells at the expense of ionocytes. Consistent with this model of mature tuft cell differentiation, we identify mature tuft cells in a patient who died from an asthma flare. Overall, our findings suggest that the immune signaling pathways active in asthma and CF may skew the composition of disease-relevant rare cells and illustrate how deep atlases are required for identifying physiologically-relevant scarce cell populations.\n\nThe human brain undergoes protracted post-natal maturation, guided by dynamic changes in gene expression. To date, studies exploring these processes have used bulk tissue analyses, which mask cell type-specific gene expression dynamics. Here, using single nucleus (sn)RNA-Sseq on temporal lobe tissue, including samples of African ancestry, we build a joint paediatric and adult atlas of 54 cell subtypes, which we verify with spatial transcriptomics. We explore the differences in cell states between paediatric and adult cell types, revealing the genes and pathways that change during brain maturation. Our results highlight excitatory neuron subtypes, including the LTK and FREM subtypes, that show elevated expression of genes associated with cognition and synaptic plasticity in paediatric tissue. The new resources we present here improve our understanding of the brain during a critical period of its development and contribute to global efforts to build an inclusive cell map of the brain.\n\nThe human brain undergoes protracted post-natal maturation, guided by dynamic changes in gene expression.

This process starts already in early fetal development and is highly active until the involution of the thymus in adolescence. To map the micro-anatomical underpinnings of this process in pre- vs. post-natal states, we undertook a spatially resolved analysis and established a new quantitative morphological framework for the thymus, the Cortico-Medullary Axis. Using this axis in conjunction with the curation of a multimodal single-cell, spatial transcriptomics and high-resolution multiplex imaging atlas, we show that canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cells are highly organised and fully established by post-conception week 12, pinpoint TEC progenitor states, find that TEC subsets and peripheral tissue genes are associated with Hassall's Corpuscles and uncover divergence in the pace and drivers of medullary entry between CD4 vs. CD8 T cell lineages. These findings are complemented with a holistic toolkit for spatial analysis and annotation, providing a basis for a detailed understanding of T lymphocyte development.\n\nTissue biology involves an intricate balance between cell-intrinsic processes and interactions between cells organized in specific spatial patterns, which can be respectively captured by single-cell profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and histology imaging data, such as Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) stains. While single-cell profiles provide rich molecular information, they can be challenging to collect routinely and do not have spatial resolution. Conversely, histological H&E assays have been a cornerstone of tissue pathology for decades, but do not directly report on molecular details, although the observed structure they capture arises from molecules and cells. Here, we leverage adversarial machine learning to develop SCHAF (Single-Cell omics from Histology Analysis Framework), to generate a tissue sample's spatially-resolved single-cell omics dataset from its H&E histology image. We demonstrate SCHAF on two types of human tumors-from lung and metastatic breast cancer-training with matched samples analyzed by both sc/snRNA-seq and by H&E staining. SCHAF generated appropriate single-cell profiles from histology images in test data, related them spatially, and compared well to ground-truth scRNA-Seq, expert pathologist annotations, or direct MERFISH measurements. SCHAF opens the way to next-generation H&E2.0 analyses and an integrated understanding of cell and tissue biology in health and disease.\n\nSingle-cell spatial transcriptomics such as in-situ hybridization or sequencing technologies can provide subcellular resolution that enables the identification of individual cell identities, locations, and a deep understanding of subcellular mechanisms. However, accurate segmentation and annotation that allows individual cell boundaries to be determined remains a major challenge that limits all the above and downstream insights. Current machine learning methods heavily rely on nuclei or cell body staining, resulting in the significant loss of both transcriptome depth and the limited ability to learn latent representations of spatial colocalization relationships. Here, we propose Bering, a graph deep learning model that leverages transcript colocalization relationships for joint noise-aware cell segmentation and molecular annotation in 2D and 3D spatial transcriptomics data. Graph embeddings for the cell annotation are transferred as a component of multi-modal input for cell segmentation, which is employed to enrich gene relationships throughout the process. To evaluate performance, we benchmarked Bering with state-of-the-art methods and observed significant improvement in cell segmentation accuracies and numbers of detected transcripts across various spatial technologies and tissues. To streamline segmentation processes, we constructed expansive pre-trained models, which yield high segmentation accuracy in new data through transfer learning and self-distillation, demonstrating the generalizability of Bering.\n\nEpithelial organoids derived from intestinal tissue, called enteroids, recapitulate many aspects of the organ in vitro and can be used for biological discovery, personalized medicine, and drug development. Here, we interrogated the cell signaling environment within the developing human intestine to identify niche cues that may be important for epithelial development and homeostasis. We identified an EGF family member, EPIREGULIN (EREG), which is robustly expressed in the developing human crypt. Enteroids generated from the developing human intestine grown in standard culture conditions, which contain EGF, are dominated by stem and progenitor cells and feature little differentiation and no spatial organization. Our results demonstrate that EREG can replace EGF in vitro, and EREG leads to spatially resolved enteroids that feature budded and proliferative crypt domains and a differentiated villus-like central lumen. Multiomic (transcriptome plus epigenome) profiling of native crypts, EGF-grown enteroids, and EREG-grown enteroids showed that EGF enteroids have an altered chromatin landscape that is dependent on EGF concentration, downregulate the master intestinal transcription factor CDX2, and ectopically express stomach genes, a phenomenon that is reversible. This is in contrast to EREG-grown enteroids, which remain intestine like in culture. Thus, EREG creates a homeostatic intestinal niche in vitro, enabling interrogation of stem cell function, cellular differentiation, and disease modeling.\n\nThe evolution and development of the head have long captivated researchers due to the crucial role of the head as the gateway for sensory stimuli and the intricate structural complexity of the head. Although significant progress has been made in understanding head development in various vertebrate species, our knowledge of early human head ontogeny remains limited. Here, we used advanced whole-mount immunostaining and 3D imaging techniques to generate a comprehensive 3D cellular atlas of human head embryogenesis. We present detailed developmental series of diverse head tissues and cell types, including muscles, vasculature, cartilage, peripheral nerves, and exocrine glands. These datasets, accessible through a dedicated web interface, provide insights into human embryogenesis. We offer perspectives on the branching morphogenesis of human exocrine glands and unknown features of the development of neurovascular and skeletomuscular structures. These insights into human embryology have important implications for understanding craniofacial defects and neurological disorders and advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\n\nHarmonizing cell types across the single-cell community and assembling them into a common framework is central to building a standardized Human Cell Atlas. Here, we present CellHint, a predictive clustering tree-based tool to resolve cell-type differences in annotation resolution and technical biases across datasets. CellHint accurately quantifies cell-cell transcriptomic similarities and places cell types into a relationship graph that hierarchically defines shared and unique cell subtypes. Application to multiple immune datasets recapitulates expert-curated annotations. CellHint also reveals underexplored relationships between healthy and diseased lung cell states in eight diseases. Furthermore, we present a workflow for fast cross-dataset integration guided by harmonized cell types and cell hierarchy, which uncovers underappreciated cell types in adult human hippocampus. Finally, we apply CellHint to 12 tissues from 38 datasets, providing a deeply curated cross-tissue database with ∼3.7 million cells and various machine learning models for automatic cell annotation across human tissues.\n\nLung cancer in never-smokers (LCINS) presents clinicopathological and molecular features distinct from that in smokers. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays important roles in cancer progression and therapeutic response. To decipher the difference in TME between never-smoker and smoker lung cancers, we conduct single-cell RNA sequencing on 165,753 cells from 22 treatment-naive lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. We find that the dysfunction of alveolar cells induced by cigarette smoking contributes more to the aggressiveness of smoker LUADs, while the immunosuppressive microenvironment exerts more effects on never-smoker LUADs' aggressiveness. Moreover, the SPP1hi pro macrophage is identified to be another independent source of monocyte-derived macrophage. Importantly, higher expression of immune checkpoint CD47 and lower expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I in cancer cells of never-smoker LUADs imply that CD47 may be a better immunotherapy target for LCINS. Therefore, this study reveals the difference of tumorigenesis between never-smoker and smoker LUADs and provides a potential immunotherapy strategy for LCINS.\n\nThe extraembryonic yolk sac (YS) ensures delivery of nutritional support and oxygen to the developing embryo but remains ill-defined in humans. We therefore assembled a comprehensive multiomic reference of the human YS from 3 to 8 postconception weeks by integrating single-cell protein and gene expression data. Beyond its recognized role as a site of hematopoiesis, we highlight roles in metabolism, coagulation, vascular development, and hematopoietic regulation. We reconstructed the emergence and decline of YS hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from hemogenic endothelium and revealed a YS-specific accelerated route to macrophage production that seeds developing organs. The multiorgan functions of the YS are superseded as intraembryonic organs develop, effecting a multifaceted relay of vital functions as pregnancy proceeds.\n\nThe human lung is structurally complex, with a diversity of specialized epithelial, stromal and immune cells playing specific functional roles in anatomically distinct locations, and large-scale changes in the structure and cellular makeup of this distal lung is a hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and other progressive chronic lung diseases. Single-cell transcriptomic studies have revealed numerous disease-emergent/enriched cell types/states in PF lungs, but the spatial contexts wherein these cells contribute to disease pathogenesis has remained uncertain. Using sub-cellular resolution image-based spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed the gene expression of more than 1 million cells from 19 unique lungs. Through complementary cell-based and innovative cell-agnostic analyses, we characterized the localization of PF-emergent cell-types, established the cellular and molecular basis of classical PF histopathologic disease features, and identified a diversity of distinct molecularly-defined spatial niches in control and PF lungs. Using machine-learning and trajectory analysis methods to segment and rank airspaces on a gradient from normal to most severely remodeled, we identified a sequence of compositional and molecular changes that associate with progressive distal lung pathology, beginning with alveolar epithelial dysregulation and culminating with changes in macrophage polarization. Together, these results provide a unique, spatially-resolved characterization of the cellular and molecular programs of PF and control lungs, provide new insights into the heterogeneous pathobiology of PF, and establish analytical approaches which should be broadly applicable to other imaging-based spatial transcriptomic studies.\n\nStudies of human lung development have focused on epithelial and mesenchymal cell types and function, but much less is known about the developing lung immune cells, even though the airways are a major site of mucosal immunity after birth. An unanswered question is whether tissue-resident immune cells play a role in shaping the tissue as it develops in utero. Here, we profiled human embryonic and fetal lung immune cells using scRNA-seq, smFISH, and immunohistochemistry. At the embryonic stage, we observed an early wave of innate immune cells, including innate lymphoid cells, natural killer cells, myeloid cells, and lineage progenitors. By the canalicular stage, we detected naive T lymphocytes expressing high levels of cytotoxicity genes and the presence of mature B lymphocytes, including B-1 cells. Our analysis suggests that fetal lungs provide a niche for full B cell maturation. Given the presence and diversity of immune cells during development, we also investigated their possible effect on epithelial maturation. We found that IL-1β drives epithelial progenitor exit from self-renewal and differentiation to basal cells in vitro. In vivo, IL-1β-producing myeloid cells were found throughout the lung and adjacent to epithelial tips, suggesting that immune cells may direct human lung epithelial development.\n\nAberrant tissue-immune interactions are the hallmark of diverse chronic lung diseases. Here, we sought to define these interactions in emphysema, a progressive disease characterized by infectious exacerbations and loss of alveolar epithelium. Single-cell analysis of human emphysema lungs revealed the expansion of tissue-resident lymphocytes (TRLs). Murine studies identified a stromal niche for TRLs that expresses Hhip, a disease-variant gene downregulated in emphysema. Stromal-specific deletion of Hhip induced the topographic expansion of TRLs in the lung that was mediated by a hyperactive hedgehog-IL-7 axis. 3D immune-stem cell organoids and animal models of viral exacerbations demonstrated that expanded TRLs suppressed alveolar stem cell growth through interferon gamma (IFNγ). Finally, we uncovered an IFNγ-sensitive subset of human alveolar stem cells that was preferentially lost in emphysema. Thus, we delineate a stromal-lymphocyte-epithelial stem cell axis in the lung that is modified by a disease-variant gene and confers host susceptibility to emphysema.\n\nCrohn's disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. CD is multifactorial, involving the complex interplay of genetic, immune, and environmental factors, necessitating a system-level understanding of its etiology. To characterize cell-type-specific transcriptional heterogeneity in active CD, we profiled 720,633 cells from the terminal ileum and colon of 71 donors with varying inflammation status. Our integrated datasets revealed organ- and compartment-specific responses to acute and chronic inflammation; most immune changes were in cell composition, whereas transcriptional changes dominated among epithelial and stromal cells. These changes correlated with endoscopic inflammation, but small and large intestines exhibited distinct responses, which were particularly apparent when focusing on IBD risk genes. Finally, we mapped markers of disease-associated myofibroblast activation and identified CHMP1A, TBX3, and RNF168 as regulators of fibrotic complications. Altogether, our results provide a roadmap for understanding cell-type- and organ-specific differences in CD and potential directions for therapeutic development.\n\nSingle-cell transcriptomic studies have identified a conserved set of neocortical cell types from small postmortem cohorts. We extended these efforts by assessing cell type variation across 75 adult individuals undergoing epilepsy and tumor surgeries. Nearly all nuclei map to one of 125 robust cell types identified in the middle temporal gyrus. However, we found interindividual variance in abundances and gene expression signatures, particularly in deep-layer glutamatergic neurons and microglia. A minority of donor variance is explainable by age, sex, ancestry, disease state, and cell state. Genomic variation was associated with expression of 150 to 250 genes for most cell types. This characterization of cellular variation provides a baseline for cell typing in health and disease.\n\nVariation in cytoarchitecture is the basis for the histological definition of cortical areas. We used single cell transcriptomics and performed cellular characterization of the human cortex to better understand cortical areal specialization. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of 8 areas spanning cortical structural variation showed a highly consistent cellular makeup for 24 cell subclasses. However, proportions of excitatory neuron subclasses varied substantially, likely reflecting differences in connectivity across primary sensorimotor and association cortices. Laminar organization of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also differed across areas. Primary visual cortex showed characteristic organization with major changes in the excitatory to inhibitory neuron ratio, expansion of layer 4 excitatory neurons, and specialized inhibitory neurons. These results lay the groundwork for a refined cellular and molecular characterization of human cortical cytoarchitecture and areal specialization.\n\nWe analyzed >700,000 single-nucleus RNA sequencing profiles from 106 donors during prenatal and postnatal developmental stages and identified lineage-specific programs that underlie the development of specific subtypes of excitatory cortical neurons, interneurons, glial cell types, and brain vasculature. By leveraging single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data, we delineated enhancer gene regulatory networks and transcription factors that control commitment of specific cortical lineages. By intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for human brain diseases, we identified the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults of different brain disorders, especially autism. We find that lineage-specific gene expression programs up-regulated in female cells are especially enriched for the genetic risk factors of autism. Our study captures the molecular progression of cortical lineages across human development.\n\nThe human brain directs complex behaviors, ranging from fine motor skills to abstract intelligence, but the diversity of cell types that support these skills has not been fully described. In this work, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain. We sampled more than three million nuclei from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain in three postmortem donors. Our analysis identified 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters organized largely according to developmental origins and revealing high diversity in midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales. The transcriptomic census of the entire human brain presented in this work provides a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease.\n\nThe adult human brain comprises more than a thousand distinct neuronal and glial cell types, a diversity that emerges during early brain development. To reveal the precise sequence of events during early brain development, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics and uncovered cell states and trajectories in human brains at 5 to 14 postconceptional weeks (pcw). We identified 12 major classes that are organized as ~600 distinct cell states, which map to precise spatial anatomical domains at 5 pcw. We described detailed differentiation trajectories of the human forebrain and midbrain and found a large number of region-specific glioblasts that mature into distinct pre-astrocytes and pre-oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Our findings reveal the establishment of cell types during the first trimester of human brain development.\n\nNeocortical layer 1 (L1) is a site of convergence between pyramidal-neuron dendrites and feedback axons where local inhibitory signaling can profoundly shape cortical processing. Evolutionary expansion of human neocortex is marked by distinctive pyramidal neurons with extensive L1 branching, but whether L1 interneurons are similarly diverse is underexplored. Using Patch-seq recordings from human neurosurgical tissue, we identified four transcriptomic subclasses with mouse L1 homologs, along with distinct subtypes and types unmatched in mouse L1. Subclass and subtype comparisons showed stronger transcriptomic differences in human L1 and were correlated with strong morphoelectric variability along dimensions distinct from mouse L1 variability. Accompanied by greater layer thickness and other cytoarchitecture changes, these findings suggest that L1 has diverged in evolution, reflecting the demands of regulating the expanded human neocortical circuit.\n\nThe cognitive abilities of humans are distinctive among primates, but their molecular and cellular substrates are poorly understood. We used comparative single-nucleus transcriptomics to analyze samples of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from adult humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets to understand human-specific features of the neocortex. Human, chimpanzee, and gorilla MTG showed highly similar cell-type composition and laminar organization as well as a large shift in proportions of deep-layer intratelencephalic-projecting neurons compared with macaque and marmoset MTG. Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes had more-divergent expression across species compared with neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and neuronal expression diverged more rapidly on the human lineage. Only a few hundred genes showed human-specific patterning, suggesting that relatively few cellular and molecular changes distinctively define adult human cortical structure.\n\nDuring early telencephalic development, intricate processes of regional patterning and neural stem cell (NSC) fate specification take place. However, our understanding of these processes in primates, including both conserved and species-specific features, remains limited. Here, we profiled 761,529 single-cell transcriptomes from multiple regions of the prenatal macaque telencephalon. We deciphered the molecular programs of the early organizing centers and their cross-talk with NSCs, revealing primate-biased galanin-like peptide (GALP) signaling in the anteroventral telencephalon. Regional transcriptomic variations were observed along the frontotemporal axis during early stages of neocortical NSC progression and in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, we found that genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and brain cancer risk might play critical roles in the early telencephalic organizers and during NSC progression.\n\nThe thalamus plays a central coordinating role in the brain. Thalamic neurons are organized into spatially distinct nuclei, but the molecular architecture of thalamic development is poorly understood, especially in humans. To begin to delineate the molecular trajectories of cell fate specification and organization in the developing human thalamus, we used single-cell and multiplexed spatial transcriptomics. We show that molecularly defined thalamic neurons differentiate in the second trimester of human development and that these neurons organize into spatially and molecularly distinct nuclei. We identified major subtypes of glutamatergic neuron subtypes that are differentially enriched in anatomically distinct nuclei and six subtypes of γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated (GABAergic) neurons that are shared and distinct across thalamic nuclei.\n\nRecent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have illuminated the diverse neuronal and glial cell types within the human brain. However, the regulatory programs governing cell identity and function remain unclear. Using a single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq), we explored open chromatin landscapes across 1.1 million cells in 42 brain regions from three adults. Integrating this data unveiled 107 distinct cell types and their specific utilization of 544,735 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the human genome. Nearly a third of the cCREs demonstrated conservation and chromatin accessibility in the mouse brain cells. We reveal strong links between specific brain cell types and neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and major depression, and have developed deep learning models to predict the regulatory roles of noncoding risk variants in these disorders.\n\nThe mammalian brain is composed of many brain structures, each with its own ontogenetic and developmental history. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to sample over 2.4 million brain cells across 18 locations in the common marmoset, a New World monkey primed for genetic engineering, and examined gene expression patterns of cell types within and across brain structures. The adult transcriptomic identity of most neuronal types is shaped more by developmental origin than by neurotransmitter signaling repertoire. Quantitative mapping of GABAergic types with single-molecule FISH (smFISH) reveals that interneurons in the striatum and neocortex follow distinct spatial principles, and that lateral prefrontal and other higher-order cortical association areas are distinguished by high proportions of VIP+ neurons. We use cell type-specific enhancers to drive AAV-GFP and reconstruct the morphologies of molecularly resolved interneuron types in neocortex and striatum. Our analyses highlight how lineage, local context, and functional class contribute to the transcriptional identity and biodistribution of primate brain cell types.\n\nThe cellular complexity of the human brain is established via dynamic changes in gene expression throughout development that is mediated, in part, by the spatiotemporal activity of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 45,549 cortical nuclei across six broad developmental time points from fetus to adult. We identified cell type-specific domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated with gene expression. Differentiation pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that chromatin accessibility at CREs precedes transcription and that dynamic changes in chromatin structure play a critical role in neuronal lineage commitment. In addition, we mapped cell type-specific and temporally specific genetic loci implicated in neuropsychiatric traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, our results describe the complex regulation of cell composition at critical stages in lineage determination and shed light on the impact of spatiotemporal alterations in gene expression on neuropsychiatric disease.\n\nCataloging the diverse cellular architecture of the primate brain is crucial for understanding cognition, behavior, and disease in humans. Here, we generated a brain-wide single-cell multimodal molecular atlas of the rhesus macaque brain. Together, we profiled 2.58 M transcriptomes and 1.59 M epigenomes from single nuclei sampled from 30 regions across the adult brain. Cell composition differed extensively across the brain, revealing cellular signatures of region-specific functions. We also identified 1.19 M candidate regulatory elements, many previously unidentified, allowing us to explore the landscape of cis-regulatory grammar and neurological disease risk in a cell type-specific manner. Altogether, this multi-omic atlas provides an open resource for investigating the evolution of the human brain and identifying novel targets for disease interventions.\n\nBrain cells are arranged in laminar, nuclear, or columnar structures, spanning a range of scales. Here, we construct a reliable cell census in the frontal lobe of human cerebral cortex at micrometer resolution in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-referenced system using innovative imaging and analysis methodologies. MRI establishes a macroscopic reference coordinate system of laminar and cytoarchitectural boundaries. Cell counting is obtained with a digital stereological approach on the 3D reconstruction at cellular resolution from a custom-made inverted confocal light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM). Mesoscale optical coherence tomography enables the registration of the distorted histological cell typing obtained with LSFM to the MRI-based atlas coordinate system. The outcome is an integrated high-resolution cellular census of Broca's area in a human postmortem specimen, within a whole-brain reference space atlas.\n\nFast-spiking interneurons (FSINs) provide fast inhibition that synchronizes neuronal activity and is critical for cognitive function. Fast synchronization frequencies are evolutionary conserved in the expanded human neocortex despite larger neuron-to-neuron distances that challenge fast input-output transfer functions of FSINs. Here, we test in human neurons from neurosurgery tissue, which mechanistic specializations of human FSINs explain their fast-signaling properties in human cortex. With morphological reconstructions, multipatch recordings, and biophysical modeling, we find that despite threefold longer dendritic path, human FSINs maintain fast inhibition between connected pyramidal neurons through several mechanisms: stronger synapse strength of excitatory inputs, larger dendrite diameter with reduced complexity, faster AP initiation, and faster and larger inhibitory output, while Na+ current activation/inactivation properties are similar. These adaptations underlie short input-output delays in fast inhibition of human pyramidal neurons through FSINs, explaining how cortical synchronization frequencies are conserved despite expanded and sparse network topology of human cortex.\n\nQuantifying neuron morphology and distribution at the whole-brain scale is essential to understand the structure and diversity of cell types. It is exceedingly challenging to reuse recent technologies of single-cell labeling and whole-brain imaging to study human brains. We propose adaptive cell tomography (ACTomography), a low-cost, high-throughput, and high-efficacy tomography approach, based on adaptive targeting of individual cells. We established a platform to inject dyes into cortical neurons in surgical tissues of 18 patients with brain tumors or other conditions and one donated fresh postmortem brain. We collected three-dimensional images of 1746 cortical neurons, of which 852 neurons were reconstructed to quantify local dendritic morphology, and mapped to standard atlases. In our data, human neurons are more diverse across brain regions than by subject age or gender. The strong stereotypy within cohorts of brain regions allows generating a statistical tensor field of neuron morphology to characterize anatomical modularity of a human brain.\n\nHuman cortical pyramidal neurons are large, have extensive dendritic trees, and yet have unexpectedly fast input-output properties: Rapid subthreshold synaptic membrane potential changes are reliably encoded in timing of action potentials (APs). Here, we tested whether biophysical properties of voltage-gated sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) currents in human pyramidal neurons can explain their fast input-output properties. Human Na+ and K+ currents exhibited more depolarized voltage dependence, slower inactivation, and faster recovery from inactivation compared with their mouse counterparts. Computational modeling showed that despite lower Na+ channel densities in human neurons, the biophysical properties of Na+ channels resulted in higher channel availability and contributed to fast AP kinetics stability. Last, human Na+ channel properties also resulted in a larger dynamic range for encoding of subthreshold membrane potential changes. Thus, biophysical adaptations of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels enable fast input-output properties of large human pyramidal neurons.\n\nNeural population activity determines the timing of synaptic inputs, which arrive to dendrites, cell bodies, and axon initial segments (AISs) of cortical neurons. Action potential initiation in the AIS (AIS-APs) is driven by input integration, and the phase preference of AIS-APs during network oscillations is characteristic to cell classes. Distal regions of cortical axons do not receive synaptic inputs, yet experimental induction protocols can trigger retroaxonal action potentials (RA-APs) in axons distal from the soma. We report spontaneously occurring RA-APs in human and rodent cortical interneurons that appear uncorrelated to inputs and population activity. Network-linked triggering of AIS-APs versus input-independent timing of RA-APs of the same interneurons results in disparate temporal contribution of a single cell to in vivo network operation through perisomatic and distal axonal firing.\n\nInflammation early in life is a clinically established risk factor for autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, yet the impact of inflammation on human brain development is poorly understood. The cerebellum undergoes protracted postnatal maturation, making it especially susceptible to perturbations contributing to the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, using single-cell genomics of postmortem cerebellar brain samples, we characterized the postnatal development of cerebellar neurons and glia in 1 to 5 year-old children, comparing individuals who had died while experiencing inflammation to those who had died as a result of an accident. Our analyses revealed that inflammation and postnatal cerebellar maturation are associated with extensive, overlapping transcriptional changes primarily in two subtypes of inhibitory neurons: Purkinje neurons and Golgi neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis of a subset of these postmortem cerebellar samples revealed no change to Purkinje neuron soma size but evidence for increased activation of microglia in those children who had experienced inflammation. Maturation-associated and inflammation-associated gene expression changes included genes implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. A gene regulatory network model integrating cell type-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility identified seven temporally specific gene networks in Purkinje neurons and suggested that inflammation may be associated with the premature downregulation of developmental gene expression programs.\n\nUnderstanding the complexity of cellular function within a tissue necessitates the combination of multiple phenotypic readouts. Here, we developed a method that links spatially-resolved gene expression of single cells with their ultrastructural morphology by integrating multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) and large area volume electron microscopy (EM) on adjacent tissue sections. Using this method, we characterized in situ ultrastructural and transcriptional responses of glial cells and infiltrating T-cells after demyelinating brain injury in male mice. We identified a population of lipid-loaded \"foamy\" microglia located in the center of remyelinating lesion, as well as rare interferon-responsive microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes that co-localized with T-cells. We validated our findings using immunocytochemistry and lipid staining-coupled single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, by integrating these datasets, we detected correlations between full-transcriptome gene expression and ultrastructural features of microglia. Our results offer an integrative view of the spatial, ultrastructural, and transcriptional reorganization of single cells after demyelinating brain injury.\n\nIdentifying cellular identities (both novel and well-studied) is one of the key use cases in single-cell transcriptomics. While supervised machine learning has been leveraged to automate cell annotation predictions for some time, there has been relatively little progress both in scaling neural networks to large data sets and in constructing models that generalize well across diverse tissues and biological contexts up to whole organisms. Here, we propose scTab, an automated, feature-attention-based cell type prediction model specific to tabular data, and train it using a novel data augmentation scheme across a large corpus of single-cell RNA-seq observations (22.2 million human cells in total). In addition, scTab leverages deep ensembles for uncertainty quantification. Moreover, we account for ontological relationships between labels in the model evaluation to accommodate for differences in annotation granularity across datasets. On this large-scale corpus, we show that cross-tissue annotation requires nonlinear models and that the performance of scTab scales in terms of training dataset size as well as model size - demonstrating the advantage of scTab over current state-of-the-art linear models in this context. Additionally, we show that the proposed data augmentation schema improves model generalization. In summary, we introduce a de novo cell type prediction model for single-cell RNA-seq data that can be trained across a large-scale collection of curated datasets from a diverse selection of human tissues and demonstrate the benefits of using deep learning methods in this paradigm. Our codebase, training data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/theislab/scTab to further enable rigorous benchmarks of foundation models for single-cell RNA-seq data.\n\nVariation in lung alveolar development is strongly linked to disease susceptibility. However, underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are difficult to study in humans. We have identified an alveolar-fated epithelial progenitor in human fetal lungs, which we grow as self-organizing organoids that model key aspects of cell lineage commitment. Using this system, we have functionally validated cell-cell interactions in the developing human alveolar niche, showing that Wnt signaling from differentiating fibroblasts promotes alveolar-type-2 cell identity, whereas myofibroblasts secrete the Wnt inhibitor, NOTUM, providing spatial patterning. We identify a Wnt-NKX2.1 axis controlling alveolar differentiation. Moreover, we show that differential binding of NKX2.1 coordinates alveolar maturation, allowing us to model the effects of human genetic variation in NKX2.1 on alveolar differentiation. Our organoid system recapitulates key aspects of human fetal lung stem cell biology allowing mechanistic experiments to determine the cellular and molecular regulation of human development and disease.\n\nEmphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) most commonly result from the effects of environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals. Genome-wide association studies have implicated ADGRG6 in COPD and reduced lung function, and a limited number of studies have examined the role of ADGRG6 in cells representative of the airway. However, the ADGRG6 locus is also associated with DLCO/VA, an indicator of gas exchange efficiency and alveolar function. Here, we sought to evaluate the mechanistic contributions of ADGRG6 to homeostatic function and disease in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. We applied an inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) platform to explore ADGRG6 function in iPSC-derived AT2s (iAT2s). We demonstrate that ADGRG6 exerts pleiotropic effects on iAT2s including regulation of focal adhesions, cytoskeleton, tight junctions, and proliferation. Moreover, we find that ADGRG6 knockdown in cigarette smoke-exposed iAT2s alters cellular responses to injury, downregulating apical complexes in favor of proliferation. Our work functionally characterizes the COPD GWAS gene ADGRG6 in human alveolar epithelium.\n\nT cells differentiate into highly diverse subsets and display plasticity depending on the environment. Although lymphocytes are key mediators of inflammation, functional specialization of T cells in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been effectively described. Here, we performed deep profiling of T cells in the intestinal mucosa of IBD and identified a CD4+ tissue-resident memory T cell (Trm) subset that is increased in Crohn's disease (CD) showing unique inflammatory properties. Functionally and transcriptionally distinct CD4+ Trm subsets are observed in the inflamed gut mucosa, among which a CD-specific CD4+ Trm subset, expressing CD161 and CCR5 along with CD103, displays previously unrecognized pleiotropic signatures of innate and effector activities. These inflammatory features are further enhanced by their spatial proximity to gut epithelial cells. Furthermore, the CD-specific CD4+ Trm subset is the most predominant producer of type 1 inflammatory cytokines upon various stimulations among all CD4+ T cells, suggesting that the accumulation of this T cell subset is a pathological hallmark of CD. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis of IBD, paving the way for decoding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a gastrointestinal complication of premature infants with high rates of morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive view of the cellular changes and aberrant interactions that underlie NEC is lacking. This study aimed at filling in this gap. We combine single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), T-cell receptor beta (TCRβ) analysis, bulk transcriptomics, and imaging to characterize cell identities, interactions, and zonal changes in NEC. We find an abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells as well as T cells that exhibit increased TCRβ clonal expansion. Villus tip epithelial cells are reduced in NEC and the remaining epithelial cells up-regulate proinflammatory genes. We establish a detailed map of aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal-immune interactions that are associated with inflammation in NEC mucosa. Our analyses highlight the cellular dysregulations of NEC-associated intestinal tissue and identify potential targets for biomarker discovery and therapeutics.\n\nHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are situated at the top of the adult hematopoietic hierarchy in mammals and give rise to the majority of blood cells throughout life. Recently, with the advance of multiple single-cell technologies, researchers have unprecedentedly deciphered the cellular and molecular evolution, the lineage relationships, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying HSC emergence in mammals. In this review, we describe the precise vascular origin of HSCs in mouse and human embryos, emphasizing the conservation in the unambiguous arterial characteristics of the HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs). Serving as the immediate progeny of some HECs, functional pre-HSCs of mouse embryos can now be isolated at single-cell level using defined surface marker combinations. Heterogeneity regrading cell cycle status or lineage differentiation bias within HECs, pre-HSCs, or emerging HSCs in mouse embryos has been figured out. Several epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of HSC generation, including long noncoding RNA, DNA methylation modification, RNA splicing, and layered epigenetic modifications, have also been recently uncovered. In addition to that of HSCs, the cellular and molecular events underlying the development of multiple hematopoietic progenitors in human embryos/fetus have been unraveled with the use of series of single-cell technologies. Specifically, yolk sac-derived myeloid-biased progenitors have been identified as the earliest multipotent hematopoietic progenitors in human embryo, serving as an important origin of fetal liver monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages in human embryos such as T and B lymphocytes, innate lymphoid cells, as well as myeloid cells like monocytes, macrophages, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes has also been depicted and reviewed here.\n\nSelf-organizing neural organoids grown from pluripotent stem cells1-3 combined with single-cell genomic technologies provide opportunities to examine gene regulatory networks underlying human brain development. Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin data over a dense time course in human organoids covering neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization and neurogenesis, and identify temporally dynamic and brain-region-specific regulatory regions. We developed Pando-a flexible framework that incorporates multi-omic data and predictions of transcription-factor-binding sites to infer a global gene regulatory network describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoids. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors affect neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the transcription factor GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous research performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify two distinct GLI3 regulomes that are central to telencephalic fate decisions: one regulating dorsoventral patterning with HES4/5 as direct GLI3 targets, and one controlling ganglionic eminence diversification later in development. Together, we provide a framework for how human model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human developmental biology.\n\nSingle-cell technologies have become essential to driving discovery in both basic and translational investigative dermatology. Despite the multitude of available datasets, a central reference atlas of normal human skin, which can serve as a reference resource for skin cell types, cell states, and their molecular signatures, is still lacking. For any such atlas to receive broad acceptance, participation by many investigators during atlas construction is an essential prerequisite. As part of the Human Cell Atlas project, we have assembled a Skin Biological Network to build a consensus Human Skin Cell Atlas and outline a roadmap toward that goal. We define the drivers of skin diversity to be considered when selecting sequencing datasets for the atlas and list practical hurdles during skin sampling that can result in data gaps and impede comprehensive representation and technical considerations for tissue processing and computational analysis, the accounting for which should minimize biases in cell type enrichments and exclusions and decrease batch effects. By outlining our goals for Atlas 1.0, we discuss how it will uncover new aspects of skin biology.\n\nSingle-cell atlases promise to provide a ‘missing link’ between genes, diseases and therapies. By identifying the specific cell types, states, programs and contexts where disease-implicated genes act, we will understand the mechanisms of disease at the cellular and tissue levels and can use this understanding to develop powerful disease diagnostics; identify promising new drug targets; predict their efficacy, toxicity and resistance mechanisms; and empower new kinds of therapies, from cancer therapies to regenerative medicine. Here, we lay out a vision for the potential of cell atlases to impact the future of medicine, and describe how advances over the past decade have begun to realize this potential in common complex diseases, infectious diseases (including COVID-19), rare diseases and cancer. This Perspective outlines how cell atlases can provide the missing links between genes, diseases and therapies, with advances already being made in several fields, including COVID-19 and cancer.\n\nCommon variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency, displays impaired terminal B-cell differentiation and defective antibody responses. Incomplete genetic penetrance and ample phenotypic expressivity in CVID suggest the participation of additional pathogenic mechanisms. Monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for CVID are uniquely valuable for studying the contribution of epigenetics to the disease. Here, we generate a single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics census of naïve-to-memory B cell differentiation in a CVID-discordant MZ twin pair. Our analysis identifies DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional defects in memory B-cells mirroring defective cell-cell communication upon activation. These findings are validated in a cohort of CVID patients and healthy donors. Our findings provide a comprehensive multi-omics map of alterations in naïve-to-memory B-cell transition in CVID and indicate links between the epigenome and immune cell cross-talk. Our resource, publicly available at the Human Cell Atlas, gives insight into future diagnosis and treatments of CVID patients. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent primary immunodeficiency. Here the authors perform single-cell omics analyses in CVID-discordant monozygotic twins and show epigenetic and transcriptional alterations associated with activation in memory B cells.\n\nDespite their importance in tissue homeostasis and renewal, human pituitary stem cells (PSCs) are incompletely characterized. We describe a human single nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq resource from pediatric, adult, and aged postmortem pituitaries (snpituitaryatlas.princeton.edu) and characterize cell-type-specific gene expression and chromatin accessibility programs for all major pituitary cell lineages. We identify uncommitted PSCs, committing progenitor cells, and sex differences. Pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that early-life PSCs are distinct from the other age groups. Linear modeling of same-cell multiome data identifies regulatory domain accessibility sites and transcription factors that are significantly associated with gene expression in PSCs compared with other cell types and within PSCs. We identify distinct deterministic mechanisms that contribute to heterogeneous marker expression within PSCs. These findings characterize human stem cell lineages and reveal diverse mechanisms regulating key PSC genes and cell type identity.\n\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading genetic cause of end stage renal disease characterized by progressive expansion of kidney cysts. To better understand the cell types and states driving ADPKD progression, we analyze eight ADPKD and five healthy human kidney samples"
