        "text": "Ascend Beyond is a men’s luxury brand founded in 2021 by Emanuele Abbondanza and Marco Grossi.\n\nWe create well-cared items inspired by Mediterranean imagery, to recount a thoughtful and meditative commentary on life’s circumstances.\n\nFor us, clothing is a form of expression born from reflections on desire, aspirations, and self-consciousness, which lead to a wide-ranging, extensive narrative.\n\nYou could easily compare it to conscious rap – a hip-hop subgenre that, just like Ascend Beyond, encourages discovering insights on an individual level that could lead to collective positive change.\n\nOurs is a thoughtful, meditative identity, constantly focused on investigating creative, cultural, and self-awareness issues, with our collections adopted as a telling means of cross-sectional outreach."
