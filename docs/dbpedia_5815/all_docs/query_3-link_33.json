        "text": "Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) struggle to learn their native language for no obvious reason. DLD is an extremely common neurodevelopmental disorder, with recent estimates indicating the prevalence of DLD is 7% (Norbury et al., 2016). DLD has serious economic and social consequences – it is associated with a higher risk for academic underachievement, unemployment, social and behavioural difficulties, and detriment to well-being (Conti-Ramsden et al., 2018). Although we know that DLD does not result from gross neural lesions, we still do not have a clear picture of how brain anatomy differs in children with DLD (Krishnan et al., 2016; Mayes et al., 2015). This is not only practically relevant but would also help us to understand the neural underpinnings of language development. Here, we use a robust new semiquantitative imaging protocol – MPM or multi-parameter mapping (Weiskopf et al., 2013; Weiskopf et al., 2021) – to shed light on microstructural neural differences in a large group of children with DLD.\n\nThere is a dearth of literature examining brain structure in children with DLD, which is surprising given the prevalence and impact of DLD. In the available literature, grey matter changes have been noted in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior superior temporal gyrus (Badcock et al., 2012; Gauger et al., 1997; Jäncke et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2020; Plante, 1991; Preis et al., 1998). These are core regions for language processing, with language activation in these regions observed across the literature (Price, 2012) and across languages (Malik-Moraleda et al., 2021). Differences have also been noted in areas homologous to these language regions, such as the right perisylvian cortex (Girbau-Massana et al., 2014; Jäncke et al., 2007; Kurth et al., 2018). However, there is variability in the direction of differences reported in different studies – for instance, both increases and decreases in grey matter have been noted in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Badcock et al., 2012; Gauger et al., 1997; reviewed in Mayes et al., 2015).\n\nIn addition to these cortical changes in the language network, we, and others, have hypothesised that the dorsal striatum is important for language learning, and may be abnormal in DLD (Krishnan et al., 2016; Ullman et al., 2020; Ullman and Pierpont, 2005). The dorsal striatum is important for habitual and sequential learning (Graybiel and Grafton, 2015; Yin and Knowlton, 2006), and we hypothesise that it may play an important role in the acquisition of language because of the complexity of sequencing required for language. In accordance, a series of behavioural studies has suggested that sequential learning in the linguistic and non-linguistic domains is affected in children with DLD (Hsu and Bishop, 2014; Lum et al., 2014; but see West et al., 2018; West et al., 2021). In studies that probe complex sequential production in the vocal domain, the dorsal striatum is implicated (Rauschecker et al., 2008; Simmonds et al., 2014; Skipper et al., 2020). The striatum is structurally and functionally connected to regions associated with language production, with the head of the dorsolateral caudate nucleus receiving inputs from inferior frontal cortex, and the putamen receiving inputs from motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortex (Alexander et al., 1986; Jarbo and Verstynen, 2015; Lima et al., 2016). The importance of the dorsal striatum for speech and language was first highlighted by work on the KE family, who have a point mutation in the FOXP2 gene and a behavioural profile similar to DLD (Watkins et al., 2002a), as well as childhood apraxia of speech. Morphometric studies revealed that affected members of the KE family had reduced grey matter in regions not typically associated with language processing such as the head of the caudate nucleus, areas within the sensorimotor cortex, the posterior inferior temporal cortex and the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, and increased grey matter in the putamen (Argyropoulos et al., 2019; Belton et al., 2003; Watkins et al., 2002b). These studies indicate that corticostriatal circuits might have a role in co-ordinating and learning the fine auditory-motor sequencing required for language.\n\nStudies of children with DLD analysing standard T1-weighted scans have also indicated reductions in the size of the caudate nucleus (Badcock et al., 2012; Herbert et al., 2003; Jernigan et al., 1991). Other studies do not wholly support the view that the volume of the caudate nuclei is reduced in DLD but do indicate that there is some abnormality. Lee et al., 2013 found reduced absolute volumes in the caudate nucleus and thalamus in individuals with DLD. These relationships did not survive correcting for total intracranial volume, which was significantly reduced in their DLD participants. The authors also observed negative relationships between language proficiency and the relative volume of subcortical structures such as the nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, putamen, and hippocampus. Others have suggested that volumetric differences in the caudate nuclei are modulated by age, with only younger children showing differences in volume (Soriano-Mas et al., 2009). Finally, some more recent studies suggest that children with DLD have greater grey matter in the right cerebellum (Pigdon et al., 2019). The interpretation of both cortical and subcortical findings is complicated by the heterogeneity of the DLD populations sampled, and the small sample sizes investigated. However, another factor that may also contribute to this lack of clarity is the nature of the scans acquired.\n\nStandard structural imaging protocols such as T1-weighted scans reflect a complex mix of tissue properties, or in other words, the contrast between grey and white matter reflects a combination of histological properties such as iron content, myelin, cell density, and water. Importantly, these microstructural properties yield regionally specific contributions to commonly used structural markers such as grey matter volume or cortical thickness, which complicate the interpretation of these markers (Lorio et al., 2014; Lorio et al., 2016). As standard T1-weighted imaging protocols are dependent on acquisition parameters that can vary across scanners, they are also often difficult to replicate across studies. More recently, semiquantitative MRI methods have been used to map-specific properties of tissue (Weiskopf et al., 2021). Semiquantitative protocols such as MPM can provide specific indices of microstructure, including myelin and macromolecular content of neural tissue, and the resulting maps are highly reproducible across individuals and scanners (Leutritz et al., 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2013). In the MPM quantitative imaging protocol, multiple maps are constructed, which allow us to probe different tissue properties. The generated maps quantify (1) the longitudinal relaxation rate R1 [1/T1], (2) the transverse relaxation rate R2* [1/T2*], and (3) Magnetization Transfer saturation (MTsat). The dominant influence on R1 in cortical tissue is myelin (Lutti et al., 2014), although R1 is sensitive to both myelin and iron in subcortical grey matter. R2* is sensitive to iron concentration, especially in ferritin-rich regions such as the striatum (Langkammer et al., 2010). MTsat is sensitive to bound water, and consequently myelin (Schmierer et al., 2004). This quantitative protocol therefore represents an unparalleled means of acquiring time-efficient, multi-modal, whole-brain data with insight into tissue composition. Such semiquantitative maps have been used to delineate heavily myelinated areas such as somatomotor (Carey et al., 2017), visual (Sereno et al., 2013), and auditory cortex (Dick et al., 2012). They have also been used to characterise developmental maturation in adolescence and young adulthood (Carey et al., 2018; Ziegler et al., 2019; Paquola et al., 2019; Whitaker et al., 2016), during ageing (Callaghan et al., 2014; Draganski et al., 2011; Steiger et al., 2016), and in pathological populations (Freund et al., 2013; Manara et al., 2019). A growing number of studies use these maps to understand brain–behaviour relationships (Allen et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2020). Most recently, we have used MPMs and found elevated iron levels in the putamen and speech motor network in people who stutter (Cler et al., 2021). However, this novel semiquantitative protocol has not yet been used to examine microstructure in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. A particular advantage of this protocol is that its sensitivity to cortical myelin can help distinguish two different explanations of developmental change in grey matter. Developmentally, cortical thinning indexed through grey/white matter contrast changes in standard T1-weighted scans could reflect a loss in the number of connections within grey matter, that is ‘synaptic pruning’ (Huttenlocher, 1979), or a gain in the volume of tissue through increased intra-cortical myelination that appears to ‘whiten’ the grey matter on T1-weighted images (Paus, 2005). Recent studies using MPM protocols have shown that cortical thinning during development is associated with increased myelination rather than synaptic pruning (Natu et al., 2019; Whitaker et al., 2016)."
