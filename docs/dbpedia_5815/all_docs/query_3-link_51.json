        "text": "Tissue fibrosis remains unamenable to meaningful therapeutic interventions and is the primary cause of chronic graft failure after organ transplantation. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E), a key translational regulator, serves as convergent target of multiple upstream profibrotic signaling pathways that contribute to mesenchymal cell (MC) activation. Here, we investigate the role of MAP kinase–interacting serine/threonine kinase–induced (MNK-induced) direct phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine 209 (Ser209) in maintaining fibrotic transformation of MCs and determine the contribution of the MNK/eIF4E pathway to the pathogenesis of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). MCs from patients with CLAD demonstrated constitutively higher eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209, and eIF4E phospho-Ser209 was found to be critical in regulating key fibrogenic protein autotaxin, leading to sustained β-catenin activation and profibrotic functions of CLAD MCs. MNK1 signaling was upregulated in CLAD MCs, and genetic or pharmacologic targeting of MNK1 activity inhibited eIF4E phospho-Ser209 and profibrotic functions of CLAD MCs in vitro. Treatment with an MNK1/2 inhibitor (eFT-508) abrogated allograft fibrosis in an orthotopic murine lung-transplant model. Together these studies identify what we believe is a previously unrecognized MNK/eIF4E/ATX/β-catenin signaling pathway of fibrotic transformation of MCs and present the first evidence, to our knowledge, for the utility of MNK inhibitors in fibrosis.\n\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most common and relevant opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised individuals such as kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). The exact mechanisms underlying the disability of cytotoxic T cells to provide sufficient protection against CMV in immunosuppressed individuals have not been identified yet. Here, we performed in-depth metabolic profiling of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in immunocompromised patients and show the development of metabolic dysregulation at the transcriptional, protein, and functional level of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in KTRs with non-controlled CMV infection. These dysregulations comprise impaired glycolysis and increased mitochondrial stress, which is associated with an intensified expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nucleotidase (NADase) CD38. Inhibiting NADase activity of CD38 reinvigorated the metabolism and improved cytokine production of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings were corroborated in a mouse model of CMV infection under conditions of immunosuppression. Thus, dysregulated metabolic states of CD8+ T cells could be targeted by inhibiting CD38 to reverse hypo-responsiveness in individuals who fail to control chronic viral infection.\n\nLeukemia relapse is a major cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). We tested the potential of targeting TIM-3 for improving graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. We observed differential expression of TIM-3 ligands when hematopoietic stem cells overexpressed certain oncogenic-driver mutations. Anti-TIM-3 Ab-treatment improved survival of mice bearing leukemia with oncogene-induced TIM-3 ligand expression. Conversely, leukemia cells with low ligand expression were anti-TIM-3 treatment-resistant. In vitro, TIM-3 blockade or genetic deletion in CD8+ T cells (Tc) enhanced Tc activation, proliferation and IFN-γ production while enhancing GVL effects, preventing Tc exhaustion and improving Tc cytotoxicity and glycolysis in vivo. Conversely, TIM-3 deletion in myeloid cells did not affect allogeneic Tc proliferation and activation in vitro, suggesting that anti-TIM-3-treatment-mediated GVL effects are Tc-induced. In contrast to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4-treatment, anti-TIM-3-treatment did not enhance acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). TIM-3 and its ligands were frequently expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells of patients with post-allo-HCT relapse. We deciphered the connection between oncogenic mutations found in AML and TIM-3 ligands expression and identify anti-TIM-3-treatment as a strategy to enhance GVL effects via metabolic and transcriptional Tc-reprogramming, without exacerbation of aGVHD. Our findings support clinical testing of anti-TIM-3 Abs in patients with AML relapse post-allo-HCT.\n\nTolerance of mouse kidney allografts arises in grafts that develop regulatory Tertiary Lymphoid Organs (rTLOs). scRNAseq data and adoptive transfer of alloreactive T cells post-transplant showed that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are reprogrammed within the accepted graft to an exhausted/regulatory-like phenotype mediated by IFN-γ. Establishment of rTLOs was required since adoptive transfer of alloreactive T cells prior to transplantation results in kidney allograft rejection. Despite intragraft CD8+ cells with a regulatory phenotype, they were not essential for the induction and maintenance of kidney allograft tolerance since renal allotransplantation into CD8 KO recipients resulted in acceptance and not rejection. Analysis of scRNAseq data from allograft kidneys and malignant tumors identified similar regulatory-like cell types within the T cell clusters and trajectory analysis showed that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are reprogrammed into an exhausted/regulatory-like phenotype intratumorally. Induction of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell dysfunction of infiltrating cells appears to be a beneficial mechanistic pathway that protects the kidney allotransplant from rejection through a process we call “defensive tolerance.” This pathway has implications for our understanding of allotransplant tolerance and tumor resistance to host immunity.\n\nCalcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) constitute the backbone of modern acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis regimens but have limited efficacy in the prevention and treatment of chronic GVHD (cGVHD). We investigated the effect of CNIs on immune tolerance after stem cell transplantation with discovery-based single-cell gene expression and T cell receptor (TCR) assays of clonal immunity in tandem with traditional protein-based approaches and preclinical modeling. While cyclosporin and tacrolimus suppressed the clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells during GVHD, alloreactive CD4+ T cell clusters were preferentially expanded. Moreover, CNIs mediated reversible dose-dependent suppression of T cell activation and all stages of donor T cell exhaustion. Critically, CNIs promoted the expansion of both polyclonal and TCR-specific alloreactive central memory CD4+ T cells (TCM) with high self-renewal capacity that mediated cGVHD following drug withdrawal. In contrast to posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), CSA was ineffective in eliminating IL-17A–secreting alloreactive T cell clones that play an important role in the pathogenesis of cGVHD. Collectively, we have shown that, although CNIs attenuate aGVHD, they paradoxically rescue alloantigen-specific TCM, especially within the CD4+ compartment in lymphoid and GVHD target tissues, thus predisposing patients to cGVHD. These data provide further evidence to caution against CNI-based immune suppression without concurrent approaches that eliminate alloreactive T cell clones.\n\nThere is increasing need to expand availability of donor liver grafts, including steatotic livers. However, the current use of steatotic grafts in liver transplantation is less acceptable due to their higher susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. To investigate the mechanism underlying the susceptibility of steatotic liver to I/R injury, we detected cell death markers and inflammation in clinical donor livers and animal models. We found that caspase-8-mediated hepatic apoptosis is activated in steatotic liver I/R. However, ablation of caspase-8 only slightly mitigated steatotic liver I/R injury without affecting inflammation. We further demonstrated that RIPK1 kinase induces both caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and cell death-independent inflammation. Inhibition of RIPK1 kinase significantly protects against steatotic liver I/R injury by alleviating both hepatic apoptosis and inflammation. Additionally, we found that RIPK1 activation is induced by Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) but not the canonical TNFα pathway during steatotic liver I/R. Deletion of ZBP1 substantially decreases the steatotic liver I/R injury. Mechanistically, ZBP1 is amplified by palmitic acid-activated JNK pathway in steatotic livers. Upon I/R, excessive reactive oxygen species trigger ZBP1 activation by inducing its aggregation independent of the Z-nucleic acids sensing action in steatotic livers, leading to the kinase activation of RIPK1 and the subsequent aggravation of liver injury. Thus, ZBP1-mediated RIPK1-driven apoptosis and inflammation exacerbate steatotic liver I/R injury, which could be targeted to protect steatotic donor livers during transplantation.\n\nHypothermia is commonly used to protect donor hearts during transplantation. However, patients transplanted with aged donor hearts still have severe myocardial injury and decreased survival rates, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Because aged hearts are not considered suitable for donation, the number of patients awaiting heart transplants is increasing. In this study, we examined whether hypothermic cardioprotection was attenuated in aged donor hearts during transplantation and evaluated potential therapeutic targets. Using a rat heart transplantation model, we found that hypothermic cardioprotection was impaired in aged donor hearts but preserved in young donor hearts. RNA-Seq showed that cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirbp) expression was decreased in aged donor hearts, and these hearts showed severe ferroptosis after transplantation. The young donor hearts from Cirbp-KO rats exhibited attenuated hypothermic cardioprotection, but Cirbp overexpression in aged donor hearts ameliorated hypothermic cardioprotection. Cardiac proteomes revealed that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) expression was significantly decreased in Cirbp-KO donor hearts during transplantation. Consequently, DHODH-mediated ubiquinone reduction was compromised, thereby exacerbating cardiac lipid peroxidation and triggering ferroptosis after transplantation. A cardioplegic solution supplemented with CIRBP agonists improved hypothermic cardioprotection in aged donor hearts, indicating that this method has the potential to broaden the indications for using aged donor hearts in transplantation.\n\nNeuroinflammation is a recognized complication of immunotherapeutic approaches such as immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, chimeric antigen receptor therapy, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) occurring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While T cells and inflammatory cytokines play a role in this process, the precise interplay between the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system that propagates inflammation in the central nervous system remains incompletely understood. Using a murine model of GVHD, we demonstrate that type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) signaling plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammation. In these studies, we identify that CB2R expression on microglial cells induces an activated inflammatory phenotype which potentiates the accumulation of donor-derived proinflammatory T cells, regulates chemokine gene regulatory networks, and promotes neuronal cell death. Pharmacological targeting of this receptor with a brain penetrant CB2R inverse agonist/antagonist selectively reduces neuroinflammation without deleteriously affecting systemic GVHD severity. Thus, these findings delineate a therapeutically targetable neuroinflammatory pathway and has implications for the attenuation of neurotoxicity after GVHD and potentially other T cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches.\n\nEndothelial function and integrity are compromised after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), but how this affects immune responses broadly remains unknown. Using a preclinical model of CMV reactivation after BMT, we found compromised antiviral humoral responses induced by IL-6 signaling. IL-6 signaling in T cells maintained Th1 cells, resulting in sustained IFN-γ secretion, which promoted endothelial cell (EC) injury, loss of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) responsible for IgG recycling, and rapid IgG loss. T cell–specific deletion of IL-6R led to persistence of recipient-derived, CMV-specific IgG and inhibited CMV reactivation. Deletion of IFN-γ in donor T cells also eliminated EC injury and FcRn loss. In a phase III clinical trial, blockade of IL-6R with tocilizumab promoted CMV-specific IgG persistence and significantly attenuated early HCMV reactivation. In sum, IL-6 invoked IFN-γ–dependent EC injury and consequent IgG loss, leading to CMV reactivation. Hence, cytokine inhibition represents a logical strategy to prevent endothelial injury, thereby preserving humoral immunity after immunotherapy.\n\nAntibodies can initiate lung injury in a variety of disease states such as autoimmunity, transfusion reactions, or after organ transplantation, but the key factors determining in vivo pathogenicity of injury-inducing antibodies are unclear. Harmful antibodies often activate the complement cascade. A model for how IgG antibodies trigger complement activation involves interactions between IgG Fc domains driving assembly of IgG hexamer structures that activate C1 complexes. The importance of IgG hexamers in initiating injury responses was unclear, so we tested their relevance in a mouse model of alloantibody and complement-mediated acute lung injury. We used three approaches to block alloantibody hexamerization (antibody carbamylation, the K439E Fc mutation, or treatment with domain B from Staphylococcal protein A), all of which reduced acute lung injury. Conversely, Fc mutations promoting spontaneous hexamerization made a harmful alloantibody into a more potent inducer of acute lung injury and rendered an innocuous alloantibody pathogenic. Treatment with a recombinant Fc hexamer ‘decoy’ therapeutic protected mice from lung injury, including in a model with transgenic human FCGR2A expression that exacerbated pathology. These results indicate an in vivo role of IgG hexamerization in initiating acute lung injury and the potential for therapeutics that inhibit or mimic hexamerization to treat antibody-mediated diseases."
