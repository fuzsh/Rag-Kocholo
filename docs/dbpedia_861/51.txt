To Lillian Massey Treble

By Jean Blewett

A woman with a heart of gold

I heard her called before I knew

How noble was that heart and true,

How full of tenderness untold.

Her sympathies both broad and sure,

Her one desire to do the right -

Clear visioned from the inner light

God gives to souls unworldly, pure.

A heart of gold that loves and gives,

God's almoner from day to day,

Of her there is but this to say:

The world is better that she lives.
