View of yesterday s developments i hardly think that now. From the greek papers i am receiving it appears to me that As soon As the allies have landed a sufficiently Large Forue in Greece that we will join in. We wan to sure that we won t be up against overwhelm ing there Are about 100 greek reservists in the City it is said that had Greece taken up arms against the allies not one of them would have an attempt to go Back and fight but should the policy of veni Zelos now Triumph not Only the reservists but All Able bodied greeks who can possibly manage it will re turn to their native country. The greeks Here expect that an other general election throughout Greece will be held and the result they say will be that Venizelos will be returned with a greater majority and his party stronger than Ever before.
