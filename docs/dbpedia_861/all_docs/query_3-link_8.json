        "text": "Lillian Massey Building, Department of Household Sciences. View is from the west side of Queens Park, south of Bloor Street West.\n\nThe solidly impressive building that occupies the southeast corner of Bloor Street West and Queens Park (157 Bloor Street) is a reminder of the great public buildings erected across Canada in the 19th and early-20th centuries. The Department of Household Sciences building in Toronto is one of the finest example of these structures. The funds for its construction were provided by Lillian Massey, whose father was Hart Massey. He was the founder of the Massey-Harris Company, at one time the biggest manufacturer of agricultural machinery in the British Empire. Hart Massey donated Massey Hall to the city; other structures associated with the Massey family are Hart House on the University of Toronto’s downtown campus, and Massey College, a graduate residential college.\n\nLillian Massey was born in 1854 in Newcastle (Durham Region), in Canada West (Ontario). In 1897, in Toronto, she married John Mill Treble. Throughout her life, she remained keenly engaged in social reform, philanthropy and education. A wealthy heiress, she was also a patron of the University of Toronto.\n\nLillian was a believer in “scientific household management” and was one of the first in the country to promote this concept. She was instrumental in having the University of Toronto offer a four-year degree programme in household science to educate women to manage their homes scientifically. Lillian believed that these courses would better women’s lives.\n\nIn 1905, she went a step further and donated funds to erect a building to house the new department. It was to include facilities to support the teaching staff, as well as classrooms, laboratories, and recreational facilities. It was to possess a gymnasium and a swimming pool, the latter located in the basement. At the time, these athletic facilities were to be the only ones on campus open to female students.\n\nConstruction on the Household Sciences building began in 1908, and it required five years to complete. When it opened in 1913, it was a spectacular structure, its interior trimmed with marble and oak. There was also a series of stained-glass windows, by artist Henry Holiday (1839-1927), the windows dedicated to Lillian’s mother, Eliza Phelps. They were in the Pre-Raphaelite style, featuring simple lines and large areas of brilliant colours, such as found in the early Italian painters before the famous Italian painter—Raphael. The windows were placed in the stairwell surrounding the staircase in the entrance hall. Images in the stained glass depicted Egyptian women performing household tasks, the male figures engaged in hunting and harvesting.\n\nThe architect Lillian selected for the building was George M. Miller, who had supervised the designs for Massey Hall on behalf of an American architectural firm. Miller chose the Neo-Classical style for the structure, which was very popular for large public and commercial buildings in that decade. The portico was supported by four Ionic pillar of Indiana limestone, the pediment above it containing the coat of arms of the University of Toronto. The porch and west facade faced Queens Park, directly across from the Royal Ontario Museum. At the time, the building was considered the finest facility of its kind in North America.\n\nThe domestic courses offer in the building were reviewed in the 1960s, resulting in the university deciding to phase out the program. Some courses were transferred to the Faculty of Medicine and others to the Faculty of Arts and Science. However, by this time the building was showing its age and was in need of renovation. Despite this, the Lillian Massey Building continued to house some courses of the Department of Household Science until the 1970s. Then, it was occupied by the Department of Nutritional Sciences, a part of the Faculty of Medicine. In 1975, it was designated a heritage structure by the City of Toronto.\n\nIn 2007, the building was finally renovated by the University of Toronto. It presently houses the Department of Classics and the Centre for Medieval Studies, as well as a Club Monaco store. Thankfully, it is one of our historical buildings that remains purposefully occupied.\n\nThe author is grateful for the information contained in: medieval.utoronto.ca/about/history/lillian-massey-building/ and\n\nwww.blogto.com/…/nostalgia_tripping_the_lillian_massey_department_of_household…\n\nNote: Photo of stained glass window is from the Toronto Public Library, photo by John Elmsley.\n\nGazing east on Bloor Street toward Avenue Road (Queens Park) in 1912, prior to the widening of the street.
