Antlers is in Pushmataha county, everyone calls it Push for short, and Teresa Young is the Pushmataha County Assistant Coordinator for GenWeb at Antlers, Oklahoma. She took the bell pics for me. Push is one of the most beautiful parts of the state. I love to go through there on the way to Arkansas. Mountains and pine trees everywhere!

I dont know of one thing horse apples are good for, do you? When I was out at King Lake Southeast of 3rd and P NE a while back, I happened across a horse apple tree with horse apples everywhere. Seems like someone told me when I was a kid that horse apples were not good for horses. Anyone know? http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/horsea2.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/horsea3.jpg\n\nI know our refinery here in Ardmore had several owners over the years. Does anyone know if they were every owned by Wirt Franklin Oil? This would have been back in the 30s probably. I wonder how one would go about finding out info like this way back in the 20s and 30s?\n\nOur little history group went over 14,000 minutes and 1,000 calls for October!

He is the grandson of Ellsworth Collins, the man that used to own the whole Turner Falls area. Collins built the little buildings\" for tourists to look at. As sort of a tourist trap. He wanted them to stop and look. The buildings are not tall enough for even Bill to stand up in, and he is only about 5' 8\" tall. They never served any other purpose. The only buildings that were used are on the east side of Honey Creek. And there was never a ranch there. Ellsworth Collins was Dean of Education at OU for a while and he was a collector. The Cowboy Hall of Fame Museum has a hugh barb wire collection. It is now one of their prime permanent exhibits. It was largely donated by the heirs of Collins. Collins heirs gave Turner Falls to the city of Davis. Also donated the land that became Camp Classen.\" http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/tfalls10q.jpg\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Funny you should mention those little rock buildings up in the hills of Turner Falls. I was up there just a couple of weeks ago during the craft fair. I took a walk up to the falls and also took some time to climb up to the buildings. The buildings were once the headquarters for the Collins Ranch. On one old rock gate is a sign that says \"Wyld Acre\". (There's a story behind that name, but I can't remember it.) There is also a sign that tells a little about Mr. Collins and about the architectural style. The structures are really fascinating. They are all separate from each other, connected only by pathways. Several are multi-story structures with stairways barely wide enough for a medium-sized person to climb. Most of the buildings have a fireplace, and the ceilings are not much more than 6 feet high. It's hard to tell which rooms were living quarters and which were for sleeping. I'm sure they were probably multi-functional. I found nothing that resembled a kitchen, but there were several outdoor cooking areas....fire pits, rock fireplaces, and rock picnic tables. What made the biggest impression on me was not the fascinating old buildings, but the TERRIBLE state of disrepair!! The buildings were filled with trash, doors were either barely hanging on rusted hinges or completely torn off, and the effects of vandalism were evident throughout. Graffiti is everywhere! I think the city of Davis (if they are still in charge of the park) should be ASHAMED!! These buildings are a part of local history, and are being destroyed by lack of care and supervision. I would hate to see them made off limits to the public, but perhaps that is what it will take to preserve them. Maybe that's not the answer, but something most definitely needs to be done before it's too late. So much for my soap box lecture of the day. I'm curious if anyone else has been there recently and has the same impression. Turner Falls, in general, is still one of the most beautiful places in our area.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"I remember Muncie Reese as a teacher. One of her students in my class (I won't print his name) was chewing tobacco when he came in to class. He was much larger than Mrs. Reese, but she made him swallow it. Someone put her stool up on top of a filing cabinet by her desk and she couldn't get it down. I guess someone got it down for her. She was good natured about everything though. What I didn't much like in highschool was having to memorize poems. Julia Sparger was English teacher and she was about half the size of her husband. When I left to go to college the person who interviewed me said that I would not have a good background in math, but my English would be very good. He told me that when he found out I was from Ardmore. This was right after the Korean war and all the men teachers were drafted. We had a few good math and geography teachers back then though.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, this makes me laugh. It is so funny, but I realize it was not funny then. As an ex-junior high and highschool teacher, I am relieved that you boys never got into trouble again. But the story brings back memories of the days when I was teaching kids just like you were!!!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Hi Butch. Just wanted to say thank you for recommending to eat at the Broadway Cafe. My sister treva; her son Jeremy who is 13 & myself went there tonight for supper & had one of those delicious hamburgers you talked about. That was the best homemade hamburger & french fries I have eaten in a long time!!! What a change from the other hamburger places here in town!! We WILL be going back down there. Again thanks for recommending it. I am really enjoying the memories of Washington School. I went there also & so did all my brothers & sisters. What memories!! So sad it burned down! Still enjoying your weekly T&T.Keep up the good work!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Enjoyed all the emails in the last T and T about Washington School, too! I very narrowly escaped a paddling by Mr. Connely when after school one day, Ricky Dickson tried to start an argument/scuffle out on the back steps of the school with me and we both got sent to the office...WHEW, I never was so scared! Wonder what's happened to Tommy Little and Peggy Mize, etc. Last I heard, Tommy worked at the auto center out at Ward's before it closed. Tommy and I used to ride our tricycles around the neighborhood and gather pop bottles to spend on candy at Hunt's grocery store. Peggy rode up to our house on a horse one day and was trying to find homes for some stray puppies...I always thought that was a very kind thing to do...That story about you and Jimmy Echer getting into trouble was very interesting, too. Glad the judge showed you both mercy...Sure wish Jimmy was still here...his Mom, Mary Margaret, gave me one of his paintings when I babysat her grandson one summer. She said a lot of them were ruined (what a shame and a tragedy) when they were in a little storage building out back of their house a few years ago, so she wanted me to have it. It wasn't one of his better ones, but I'll keep and treasure it nonetheless! The one he did of Archie Bunker (Carrol O'Conner) was excellent!\" rindy919@swbell.net\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"The mention of car \"boots\" made me think of a story a friend told me about his visit to Australia. Instead of garage sales, they have what they call \"car boot sales\". Everyone packs up their unwanted junk, loads it in the \"boot\" of the car and heads to a local field where they have what resembles a big flea market. No prices are marked. You just sit around and dicker all day to get the best bargain. My kind of place!!!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, you mentioned Boise City in this weeks T&T. I lived in Colorado just North of Boise City for awhile. We went there to shop now and then and to team ropings. Did you know that Boise City is the only US mainland city to be bombed during WWII? Check it out some time. Of course it was a mistake and it was one of our planes that dropped a bomb on the county courthouse.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Dear Butch: Really enjoyed the Judge Earl Brown story...so that is why you are such a good guy? As for the 1917 First Train in Healdton story. I have one of the original post cards that my dad sent us. He was here in Healdton and we were in Kansas. I was just a new baby, at the time. Well we came to Healdton on that train when I was only 9 mos. old. In the second picture you can see a man on the back of the train. That conductor, on the very back of the train, was Charlie Parker's Dad. Charlie worked, here, for a number of years for International Supply, I believe, and later on for Red Man. He was a great guy. He died in May of 1985, and his wife, Leota, ,just died on June 7, this year. I thought it was interesting that someone that lived here was the son of the conductor on the first train into Healdton. Incidently I had an e-mail from our, dyed in the wool, railroad fan Dwane Stevens, who was really excited about the same postcard offered on e-bay....and he was bidding on it. I love Dwane's enthusiasm, as it kinda parallels my interest in trains, but he goes into it deeper than I do. I have been happy to join him on some of his photo-ops of trains. My son, Alan, also is a train fan, and has a collection of pictures from all sources, and also takes pictures on his own. He has made, really nice, wooden models and always gives me books, on trains, for my birthdays or Christmas.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Healdton Pictures Web Page\" http://home.rmci.net/farrar/healdton.htm\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Hey Butch, do you or any of your readers have a picture of the old 2 story house that once sat on 5th N.E., where the apartments are now. 6th and MLK.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, the Greater SW Historical Museum used to be on the Carter Co website but I can't find it. Could you, in your spare time, ha, send their website address to me?\" http://home.swbell.net/bhamm10/\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"I was wondering if anyone remembered the \"squeeze in\" that was located on East Main in Ardmore, I think in the late 30's or early 40's. Any information or photos would be nice. I need it for a project I am doing.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, someone in your T&T today inquired about oil companies during 1919. My older brother, the late Richard D. Fronterhouse, wrote a research paper about oil development in Carter County during the 1920's. A copy is located in the Healdton Oil Museum in Healdton, OK, and it was published last year in the Healdton Herald's Oilpatch Mania. I don't know if this would help your reader or not, but the research article does contain references.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Dear Butch, Was Judge Brown the son of Henry Harlan Brown (1871-1940) and Alice Vance Brown (1875-1831) by any chance? Both H. H. and Alice are buried in Ardmore's Rosehill Cemetery, and H. H. or \"Harlan\" as he was known, was a well known Ardmore attorney and was part of the prosecution team in the trial of Clara Smith Hamon in 1921 when she was accused of murdering Jake Hamon. The jury found her not guilty in one of the most sensational trials in Ardmore's history. Harlan was my great uncle. He was the brother of my grandfather, Kelly Brown, who was also an attorney, and one of the early state congressmen from Ardmore after Oklahoma achieved statehood in 1907.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Hi Butch, I just wanted to tell the readers that I experienced MAGNETIC HILL for myself today! I am certainly impressed!!!!!!!! I stopped as I went down the hill (completely stopped) and immediately started backing up the hill. I then went all the way to the corner, turned around and headed back toward hiway 53, stopping at the first low spot and put it in neutral. I started climbing. My car reached as much as 20 mi. per. hr. then started very slowly getting a little slower, 15 then 10 etc. for quite a way. By the time I had come to a complete stop I was 2/10 of a mile from hiway 53. I drive a Buick Century so it is not like a pregnant roller skate. lol lol My husband was with me and he also was quite amazed.

On a Sunday afternoon we were at Cardinal Park on East Main and \"in a moment of thoughtlessness\" as the judge worded it, decided to break out some windows at the \"ticket building\" next to the ballpark. A man was nearby with his boy flying a radio controlled model airplane, and saw us do it. Needless to say the police came to the Junior High Tuesday afternoon and confronted me and Jimmy, which we quickly confessed to doing. At that time County Judge Earl Brown was working closely with problem kids. Our parents took us to see him at the courthouse to find out what punishment he would impose on us for our wrongdoing. Judge Brown was the nicest man and very understanding with us. He agreed to let our parents replace the broken windows with our promise to never do such a thing again. Two boys could never have been more relieved because our imaginations ran wild as we sat before him. I just knew we were going to prison. And we, or at least I never got into any trouble again, and that is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.\n\nAt was at this same time that we got into trouble as kids, that Judge Earl Brown was helping put together the first Children's Shelter and Juvenile Officer to serve Ardmore. Judge Brown was concerned about the troubled young people of Ardmore, and he became involved in many programs that helped kids. He was awarded the Silver Beaver Award by the Boy Scouts, the highest honor offered. He received a 40 year Honor of Merit Award for perfect attendance from the Ardmore Kiwanis Club. He organized the first Gideon Chapter in Ardmore. He was Postmaster for 23 years. After his 8 years as County Judge, he was appointed as Special Judge and after his retirement in 1970 he served in the Small Claims Court. And the list goes on and on, but his greatest contribution was to his church. For 47 years he was teacher at Worth Men's Bible Class at First Baptist here in Ardmore. But I don't need to read his accomplishments to know that Earl Brown was a wonderful human being and Christian. I had a 1-on-1 experience with him in Junior High that set me on the right path and probably played a important part in where I am today. Here is a photo of Judge Earl A. Brown (1893-1974). http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/earlbrown.jpg\n\nA Reader sent me a link to a photo taken in 1917 at Healdton, Oklahoma depicting the first train to arrive in Healdton. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/heald17a.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/heald17b.jpg\n\nLast week we talked about Ardmore born author Harrell McCullough. Here is a pic of Harrell from his self published book about his grandpa U.S. Marshal Selden Lindsey. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/mccullough1.jpg\n\nA Reader from Ardmore who now lives in Colorado sent me some pics of bells taken in Boise City, Oklahoma. For you who do not know your Oklahoma geography very well, Boise City is in the very far west end of the Oklahoma panhandle in No Mans Land (19 miles from Colorado). This first picture is a bell at Cimarron Heritage Center in Boise City. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/boise3.jpg These next three is a bell at the Good Shepard Catholic Church in Boise City. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/boise4.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/boise5.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/boise6.jpg\n\nA couple of weeks ago we talked about the electrical re-wiring going on at the courthouse. The Osborn Electricians out of OKC are boring several 3 inch holes through the 13 inch thick concrete floors. He is a pic I took of one of those thick concrete cores they bored out on the first floor. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/chcore.jpg\n\nI got to snap some shots of Turner Falls up in the Arbuckle Mountains north of Ardmore the other day. One pic is of those little building built on the side of the mountain along Honey Creek near the Falls. Does anyone remember the story behind those little rock buildings? One thing for sure, I truly believe Turner Falls is one of the most beautiful spots in Oklahoma! http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/tfalls10p.jpg\n\nI have some pepper sauce made in California by The Pepper Plant that tastes exactly as I remember Lt McKerson's BBQ sauce back in the 60s. This sauce is not the exact same texture, but the taste is identical. I found a website called pugsly.com that sells the \"Original California Style\" sauce at $4.95 for a 10 ounce bottle. I'm still looking for a pic of Lt McKerson's BBQ stand that was on East Main. Maybe someone out there has a photo? This sauce in CA is made by The Pepper Plant in Atascadero, CA 1-800-5414355. Also a link to a pic of this BBQ sauce. http://www.pugsly.com/Pepper_Plant.htm http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/ltmcbbq.jpg\n\nLast Saturday night Oct 21 around 9:30pm a 3.3 earthquake rumbled south of Atoka, Oklahoma. It was felt as far away as Durant. I talked to a friend at the post office and asked if he felt it. He said he and his wife were sitting in the living room and when the tremor came through, he asked his wife, \"what in the world is that\"? He said they even found items that fell off shelves in their house, the tremor was that strong. About three times a year Oklahoma has small earthquakes. There has even been recorded epicenters in western Carter county near Wilson not too long ago. Oklahoma has not been famous for earthquakes, thank goodness, but one never knows where one will hit.\n\nWe talked about mailwasher a few weeks ago, and I installed it this past week. It really works great! It let's you look at your email, even preview them, before downloading them to your computer. This way you can delete them, and bounce them back to the spammer as if you never downloaded them. This is great for junk mail. It tries to determine if mail is junk mail and mark them as such beforehand. But sometimes it misses one. I had ordered an Internet Explorer 6 CD from microsoft.com this week and when they sent me my order confirmation by email, mailwasher marked the email as spam. hahahahaha Anyway, it works good and if you have a hotmail account, it even works with that Server too. Check it all out at http://www.mailwasher.net\n\nIt looks like our history group will go over 14,000 minutes this month using WorldxChange.

Does anyone have this list? My Dad was on it and I really would like a copy of the article.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, I was just looking at the Brown Spring site, the image of the child is there, but there seems to be another image in the picture, it is in the shadow on the tombstone, it looks like the face of a woman. My wife and I have enjoyed the pictures of Young, Baum, and Wheeler schools, I think just about every member of my family was in the Young picture. My mother Bernice Williams said it was taken after church about a year before the Berwyn school was opened, about 1935. My wife Wanda Kirby Williams was in the Wheeler picture, she has since been writing to Sue, one of her class mates whom she hasn't seen in a few years (wasn't that nice of me) we enjoy t&t so keep of the good work.\" -Jerry Williams in Amarillo, Texas wanwil@arn.net\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"I read with interest your remark that the trunk of a car in England is called a boot. Also the hood is called the bonnet.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Hey Butch. good job as ever. Re: the book you referred to about Sulphur, there is a copy of it at the Chickasaw Library. I looked at it, it is a photocopy of an original book. I was interested in the part about the 'Landrum' section. That part was in reference to a Senator E.M Landrum, a Cherokee Indian whom the author was thanking for seconding the nomination of a Chickasaw for U.S. Senate. I have done extensive research on the Landrum ancestry, but have not come across that particular name, so back to genealogy.com HA.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Hi Butch, Here you go some England cockney slang: Apples & Pears = Stairs Johnie Horner = Corner Jack & Jill = Hill Rabbit & Pork = Talk Whistle & Flute = Suit Jam Jar = Car Plates of meat = Feet Bin Lids = Kids ( The lid of your garbage container maybe ) Trouble & Strife = The wife Porky Pies = Lies Dog & Bone = phone Currant Bun = The sun North & South = Your mouth Daisy Roots = Boots (Footwear)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, the party who remembered Mrs. Bishop at the high school was right. Muncie Reese WAS the History teacher there for about a zillion years. When I was in high school in the mid fifties, we used to have secret desire day and Muncie always came as a bride!!! I remember hearing about Mrs. Bishop although she was gone by the time I got to AHS. Muncie always liked the boys better than the girls. The boys could get away with anything but the girls got \"the look\". She was so short she sat on a stool. She was very intimidating. She got her hair done at the same beauty shop as my mom and whenever she was there, I stayed outside!!!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Ms Ringer was a very tough teacher I remember one time she got into a little trouble. There was two boys in my 5th grade class at Washington School it must have been in 1961 or 1962 can't remember but any way. One of these boys was at the pencil sharpener and he stab the other boy in the arm with a pencil the boy began to cry and Ms Ringer came over and took a pencil from the boy that had stab the other boy and stab him several times in the arm I remember it drew blood and the boy cried and his parents were called. Ms Ringer was called to Mr. Connley's office but she was back in class the next day if I remember correctly. I had to stay I after school almost everyday in Ms Ringer's class for some infraction and she would always give us candy when it was time to go home saying we should get a paddling but she would give us candy instead. I also remember her making us name the pictures on the wall Blue Boy , The Gleaners and so on, she was also a good artist I leaned a lot from Ms Ringer. Abraham Lincoln was her favorite person in the world I guess One day she had us write a poem as home work, well like always \"Old Luther\" didn't do it . So she got me up in front of the class and said to make up a poem, well I did. \"Three cheers for Old Abe Lincoln he is in his grave died and stinken.\" Well another paddling and after school again for \"Old Luther\" When it was time to go home Ms Ringer said she had not paddled me because it was a bad poem it was the subject and the content of the poem that got me into trouble. Ms Ringer would read us poetry, she would always read it the way the poet would have read it. Always tiring to teach us of the wonderful things in life. To me she was a great teacher there should be more like her today. Mr. Stamper was also one of my teachers he had what he called a 70 list anyone making below 70 got a swat with his paddle well Old Luther never made more that 30 or 35 so I got the paddle almost daily , One time Mr. Stamper said Luther There are 14 words on this spelling test if you spell 7 right I well give you a tootsie roll pop sucker. Well in my way of thinking a tootsie roll pop suckers sold for 2 cents and a pop bottle sold for 2 cents so I told Mr. Stamper I could sell a pop bottle and get me one of them tootsie roll pop suckers at Basil Moran's store, well here we go again Old Luther got paddled before and after the spelling test if I remember correctly. Ms Ringer and Mr. Stamper were my favorite teacher at Washington School I also remember Mr. Biles, Ms Whitmore, Ms Zomwalt, Ms Sherman, and Ms Hudgens. We move around a lot when I was in school I went to Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Dickson as well as school in Duncan, Fredrick, Walters, and in Arkansas, Indiana, We work alot pulling cotton in Western Okla. around Altas, Fredrick, and Walters we would be gone from Ardmore while the season for cotton was on and come back when it was over we went to Indiana an picked tomatoes and to Arkansas and picked peaches never made it to CA we was to broke to go that far I guess. Washington School was my favorite of all the many schools I went to. It made me sad when it burned down a lot of childhood memories of dear friends long ago Winston \"Cheesy\"Jefferson, Kenny Tate, Linda Goodin, Peggy Mize, the Dickson boys, Donna lllnisky, Tommy Little, Lloyd Lee Wickwire, Wanda Lloyd, Edward Marr, Charles Carter, Robert Miller, William Lee, Charles Lee, George Walker, just to name a few.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"While going thru some of the pictures at your website, I discovered the pictures of the old Milo Baptist Church which were taken right before and after it was burned. What makes me feel so old (AMONG OTHER THINGS!) is that I remember when they tore down part of the old Milo school/church building, dragged the smaller rooms about 40 yards to the west, and built onto them to create the \"new\" church, which is now the \"old\" one that burned. I believe it was finished about 1953. Since then I have attended more funerals in that building than I can count, due to the fact that both sides of my family, back to three sets of great-grandparents, lived and are buried there. On the happier side, I am attaching a couple of pictures of the now-NEW church, taken back in May---one shot of the outside and one of the unfinished sanctuary. I hear that it is now virtually complete and in at least partial use, and that the dedication day is set for in November---the third, I believe.

The first girl in the back row is my second cousin Ann Lowe (now Rempel); the names of the others, courtesy of her, are as follows: Back row---Ann Lowe, Charles Allen, Gayle McGoodwin (my third cousin), Charles Scoggins (went by the name Sonny Satterwhite at the time, while living with his Satterwhite grand-parents),______?, Charles? Wallace, and Barbara Rice. The second row are Jack Ward (my first cousin on my dad's side), Nelda Pender, Kenneth Clowdus, _____?_____, Venita Lynn McGoodwin (Gayle's sister; my third cousin), Donelda Smith, and Wanda Tippit. You have a picture of the former Woodford school building among the pictures on your web site, taken about 1923 I believe. The one in this picture, the only one I remember, was a nice, solid old rock building which was later gutted by fire and later fell down to the extent it had to be razed. My mother graduated at Woodford in 1930 or 1931, and it recently dawned on me that I don't know which building was there then. I'm sure she attended the old one, but possibly the new one was there before she graduated.

Here is a sneak preview of the plain vanilla cover: http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/bookcover.html\n\nA Reader sent me a link to an item on eBay this week. It is a 1908 book is authored and published by a couple of people from Sulphur, Oklahoma. By looking at the pics, the book sure looks interesting. Wish I had the book.... no telling what history lies between its covers! The name of the book is: \"The Lure of the Indian Country and a Romance of Its Great Resort\". Author: Oleta Littleheart. Publisher: A. Abbott, Sulphur OK. First Edition 1908. 153 pages on a scarce piece of Murray County & Sulphur history. Oleta Littleheart's text tells the tale of the creation of Sulphur from Chickasaw lands. It is a fascinating first hand account of life in turn of the century in Oklahoma and makes reference to the pioneers of the day, the creation of the Frisco & other rail lines, noted Chiefs & Senators, etc. Wonderful photographic illustrations and period advertisements.

Harrell McCullough (1913-1999) was born here in Ardmore. As a child he lived at the end of South Washington, on the south side of McCullough Street SW. Now we know who the street was named after, his family! Badman Bill Dalton was killed near Pooleville, Oklahoma on June 8, 1894. Back then Pooleville was Elk, Oklahoma. Harrell is the grandson of Selden Lindsey. According to Harrell's book, outlaw Bill Dalton robbed a bank in Longview, Texas then hid out in a cabin west of Pooleville (NE Carter County). Deputy Marshal Selden Lindsey went to Pooleville to arrest Dalton, and Dalton ended up being shot by Lindsey. There is a historical marker paid for and erected by Harrell McCullough on the property by the road where Dalton was killed. Selden Lindsey lived 2 miles east of Dickson, Oklahoma and then north next to Wolf Creek where it empties into the Washita River. I'll have to get up to Pooleville soon and take a photo of that historical marker about U.S. Deputy Marshal Selden Lindsey. Harrell McCullough must have been one amazing recorder of history, wish I could have met him before he died in 1999. Here is a scan of Harrell McCullough's self-published 300 page book. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/lindseyst.jpg\n\nThe following obit was printed in The Daily Ardmoreite on October 14, 1999: \"Memorial interment for Harrell McCullough will be at 10 a.m. Monday, Oct. 18, 1999, at Rose Hill Cemetery under the direction of Griffin-Kennedy-Watts Funeral Home. Mr. McCullough, age 86, was born May 5, 1913, in Ardmore, Okla., the only son of Carle and Quintella Lindsey McCullough. Mr. McCullough, beloved parent, cousin, mentor and friend, passed away on Oct. 7, 1999, at Oklahoma City. His family and dear friends feel a grievous, poignant loss which defies expression. Harrell worked for the U.S. Employment Service from 1936 to 1942, managing the Norman, Okla. office, where he was responsible for the then innovative idea of establishing an employment office on the University of Oklahoma campus. The New York times reported in June 1938 on this first student placement service to be operated by any state at any university. From 1942 to 1946, McCullough served with distinction as an armed guard commander in the U.S. Navy; most of his World War II service was as a lieutenant on the U.S. Latona, escorting troop and supply convoys across the Atlantic and throughout the Mediterranean. After World War II, he worked as an industrial economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and private firms in the Chicago area and taught economics in Ohio, Louisiana and at Oklahoma City University. He retired from Central State University at Edmond, Okla., in 1975. In 1990, after some 15 years of team research with a younger cousin, Mr. McCullough realized a lifelong dream by publishing a biography of his grandfather and historical vignette of the waning days of the Old West in Indian Territory. In 1992 his book Selden Lindsey, U.S. Deputy Marshal, was awarded the coveted Certificate of Commendation by the prestigious American Association of State and Local History, in recognition of Mr. McCullough?s life contributions to the preservation of Oklahoma history. Selden Lindsey was a pioneer U.S. Deputy Marshall for 16 years before Oklahoma statehood. Lindsey pursued and dispatched (among many others) the infamous outlaw, Bill Dalton, in June 1894. Early in his career, Selden took prisoners to Judge Isaac Parker?s Federal Court in Fort Smith, Ark.; later, federal courts were established first in Paris, Texas, and subsequently in Ardmore. Selden's grandfather, Elijah Lindsey, is celebrated as the Father of Arkansas Methodism, the first Methodist preacher in Arkansas, riding his Strawberry River circuit in northeast Arkansas as early as 1815. The Eli Lindsey Memorial Methodist Church, in Jessup, Ark., was dedicated in 1949 to his memory, with historical markers erected at the church, on Highway 117 near Jessup, and at the site of Lindsey's log adobe near Big Creek, about 16 miles northeast of Batesville, Ark. Stories of his ministry in the wilderness are still extolled in the area. Following his antecedents' examples, Harrell McCullough was active in civic affairs and championed excellence in education in Oklahoma while working tirelessly to preserve Oklahoma and Arkansas historical sites, pioneer cemeteries and endangered public records and documents. Mr. McCullough is survived by a large, extended family, including his daughter, Natasha Joan Williamson; a granddaughter, Robin Potter; and two great-grandsons, Leland and Guthrie Potter, all of Santa Fe, N.M.; one sister, Mrs. Christine McCollom; niece Ms. Leslie McCollom; nephew, Forrest H. Armstrong; aunt, Mrs. Zoma Lindsey Barricklow; cousins, Nina Fayrene Stone, Judy Lindsey Brown and Rena Lindsey Marsh, all of Ardmore; Gloria Schouw Reck of Diamond Bar, Calif.; beloved and devoted friend, Mildred DeVore, of Oklahoma City. Harrell's beloved elder sisters, Vivian Mae McCullough and Nina Vinita Ackerman, predeceased him. Mr. McCullough?s expressed sentiment was the wish that memorials be made to any animal protection society or shelter location. Harrell McCullough was very dear to his family and friends. His gentle, generous, witty and compassionate presence will be sorely missed by all who knew him, but our precious memories of Harrell and our wonderful times together will surely comfort and sustain us.\"\n\nA number of you wrote me last weekend asking for the OklahomaHistory.net email address.

Don't feel alone. There is a world shortage and supply and demand has brought prices up by a factor of at least %300. Last December beekeepers here were selling truckloads of honey in barrels for 48 and 49 cents a pound. The low price was due to foreign imports (NAFTA). The last report I heard this week was of a beekeeper in eastern Montana selling 2 truckloads for $1.60 per pound. Yields in the northwest have been small this year so an increase in price is good news for the producer. Hopefully next year we will see some moderation and things will be back to normal. In the meantime rest assured your local honey man is not gouging you and is merely following the national pricing trend. P.S. Thanks for choosing honey as your sweetener of choice.

That is a question to be answered by each individual who visits the spring and the \"Old Indian Cemetery.\"\n\nIt is a place that time has forgotten, a place which has the power to draw you into its web of mystery, eager to learn its truths. You will leave no wiser, just more curious and perhaps a bit jittery.\n\nI live just four miles from Brown's Springs and I am familiar with the twisting dirt roads and trails which lead there as well as the more common route. Long years ago I trekked through the dense woods of that area on an autumn day. I came upon a sight I had never seen before. Two snakes appeared to be doing battle and finally one snake devoured the other! Perhaps that was an ordinary occurrence, but not to me when it happens near Browns' Springs.\n\nThe area is an ideal habitat for snakes of all kinds. Those most important to watch out for are the deadly Copperheads and Rattlesnakes. It is their domain, not ours, and they reign supreme.\n\nFar more disturbing than the natural dangers of that dark and gloomy place, are the whispered rumors of a creature which many believe to live there. The elusive Bigfoot! Despite reason and logic, this myth persists along with other, more present and worldly dangers.\n\nFrequently described as an eerily silent place where no birds sing and no furry little creatures scurry about, one tends to constantly glance behind them to see if anything's gaining!\n\nThe history of the site is truly bloody and brutal and this is part of its mystique. Tales of murder and revenge are intriguing. One can't help wondering if all the violence is truly \"in the past\" or if, at any time, the violence might erupt again!\n\nWe love mysteries and, while we hope to solve them, sometimes we don't really want them solved. Do we?\n\nAre there evil spirits lurking in that dim silent place? When the photographs we take of the area are developed and show what was not in the scene before, do we shiver? Somehow, it is the photographs which, more than anything else have perpetuated the mystery of Brown's Springs. Do the revealing photographs seek to tell us of events existing in other, hidden realms?\n\nI once stood beside the bubbling spring when, suddenly bursting from the underbrush were several grim and pale faced men on horseback. Running beside them were the most ferocious looking dogs I'd ever seen, and they wore muzzles. To my polite inquiry as to what they were hunting, one stony-faced rider replied in a word; \"Hogs,\" then he and his brethren just seemed to disappear as quickly as they had appeared.\n\nNot exactly a comfortable place to be, Brown Springs. Not too long ago I was told that, living in the lagoon across the road from the springs were alligators! I won't believe that until I see it for myself, even though a trusted source gave me the information. I was also told that a very large python eluded its owner several years ago and resides somewhere in the area. A large python is another thing I wouldn't want to meet in the woods down there.\n\nWe love to be scared as long as we can flee to safety if necessary. We keep going back, certain that we'll find something really scary that we can tell everyone about. We know there is nothing supernatural or evil there, but just in case there IS, we keep going back.\n\nAs October advances and Halloween draws closer, the Brown's Springs fever rises! The prospect of a walk through the fallen leaves (and tombstones) of the \"Old Indian Cemetery\" sparks our imagination and our spirit of adventure. But we won't go there.. after sundown!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"From \"Oklahoma Place Names,\" by George Shirk: ENID.

The Gang of Bill Fights United States Marshals - Several Killed - A Bloody Encounter. Arkansas City, Kan., Sept 2, 1893 - A posse of United States marshals and the Dalton gang of bank and train robbers met at Ingalls, Payne county, Oklahoma this morning. Two of the deputy marshals - Speed and Shadley were killed, and a third named Houston was fatally wounded. N. A. Walker, N. D. Murray, G. W. Ranson and a boy named Briggs were wounded, and a young man named Wilson was killed. Officials were informed that the gang was in town and drove out to arrest them and were fired on by the outlaws when they dismounted. The fire was returned and the outlaws started for their horses. Bill Dalton's horse was killed by Shadley and as the horse fell Dalton got on his feet and pumped four shots in rapid succession into the body of Shadley with his Winchester. \"Arkansas Tom\" was one of the outlaws, who was held at bay in a frame hotel where he took refuge. Messengers were sent to Stillwater for assistance and the sheriff left at once with a posse for the scene. The outlaw finally surrendered. It is thought that he is the man who killed Deputy Marshal Speed and the Simmons boy and wounded Marshal Houston. He is now in the Stillwater jail, guarded by a posse. There were six men in the gang, five of whom escaped, but they are being pursued by a large posse.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Cherokee Land Run. Arkansas City, Kan., Sept. 2, 1893 - A careful estimate of the people now on the border in the vicinity of Arkansas City awaiting the opening of the strip, can be placed at 10,000. There are at least 300 people in Arkansas City who are residing in comfortable homes, and some engaged in business in the city, who make the run. Since the issuing of the proclamation, the daily arrivals are large and a number are coming in on the trains who are purchasing ponies and saddles and getting ready for the grand opening. It will be twelve days now until the registering booths are open and ready for business, and unless they come in faster than at the present rate, not over 30,000 or 40,000 people will get their certificates from the Arkansas City booth. It is estimated that more people will enter the strip from this point than any other place on either the north or south lines. Kildare would have probably made the best town in the strip had it been located at Willow Springs and been designated a land office. All Arkansas City people had their eyes on this town, but since its location so far north and the land office given to Perry, the county seat of the county south, Kildare seems to be losing its grip. The people of Oklahoma and especially of Guthrie, will use every means to make Perry a city of 15,000or 20,000 people within the short space of six or eight months, and will no doubt succeed. Pond Creek and Enid will make good towns, but the odds seem to be on Perry. The land office at Perry has already been completed. All sorts of rumors are afloat about the mode of entering. Some claim that Secretary Smith will make all go in afoot. Others that no trains will be allowed to enter and carry passengers; and still others that the trains will enter, but only be allowed to run at a speed of five miles an hour, while a few think that Secretary Smith will rule that all who want claims must enter in a lumber wagon drawn by a span of white horses and driven by a red-headed girl. Notwithstanding all this talk, those who intend winning are purchasing good saddles and horses, feeding dry feed and training the animals to run a good long distance.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Check out the sacramento data, up to 250 meteors per hour on the nite of the Nov 19th.

Many of you have asked if the back issues of T&Ts are available in book form. Many of you have spent a small fortune the past 6 years in paper and printer cartridges printing out T&Ts each week. And many of you mail a printed T&T to a relative or friend who does not have a computer but wants to read the T&T every weekend.

There will be no photos in the book, but the photo links like is in each email T&T will be included so the photos can be found on the T&T History CD which I will include with the purchase of the book. I know everyone's question is how much is this book going to cost?\n\nFirst, I don't want to call it a book. Maybe someday when I retire I will make a book with all the color photos and fancy hardboard covers, etc. What I'm putting together is a \"collection\" of past T&Ts on paper with softback cover. I've stripped out \"non-history\" parts and tried to print the meat of the T&Ts... Oklahoma history. This includes the Mailbag in each week's issue and other parts of the T&Ts that pertain to history. The cost will be determined by how many books we have printed. The more printed, the cheaper the cost per book. But I believe we are looking at less than $10 per book (including a History CD) and maybe even $7 or $8 per book. I have the Jul, Apr and Sept of this year's T&Ts ready to go to the printers. What I need now is your thoughts on this. Is there enough Readers who would like to have a paper form of 3 months T&Ts to warrant printing say, 100 copies? Let me hear from you..... it all hinges on what T&T Readers have to say. Just send me email at bridges@OklahomaHistory.net\n\nAnd anyone can give me a call Toll Free at 1-866-459-8626 and let me know if you like this idea of a book. If you know someone who doesn't have a computer and has been wanting a paper copy of T&Ts, give them the Toll Free number and have them call me. If I get a good positive response, I'll send it to the printers! If not, than we'll just have to wait until we get about 100 orders.\n\nHere is a sample of two pages of text of the proposed 5 1/5 by 8 1/2 book. Actual size is larger than in this photo. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/booksample.jpg\n\nSpeaking of OklahomaHistory.net several of you requested a OklahomaHistory.net email address. My offer is still good, so contact me if you would like one. Just tell me what you want the first part to be, i.e. JoeSmith@OklahomaHistory.net or whatever. This is a free email address to the Readers of T&T. My friend Kenneth Eck in Healdton has already requested Kenneth@OklahomaHistory.net so it is taken. There are several others who know have an Oklahomahistory email, so get your request in early if you want one, its free!\n\nAnd while we are on the subject of OklahomaHistory.net a few of you have even asked about having some kind of MailList or listserver. By this I mean, you send an email to my OklahomaHistory.net MailList Server and it will automatically re-send that email to everyone who requests to be on the MailList. If there are 200 members of a certain Mail Group, then everyone in that mail group will get the same message. Its all done automatically by the listserver. Example: there might be a MailList called AHS1970 or HealdtonAlumni, etc., and everyone who is a member of that list will be able to post and received email from the listserver. One just hast to come up with a catchy group name! Its free, so let me know if anyone wants to form a Mail Group and give it a try!\n\nThanks to a Reader near the panhandle, that part of the state is almost yellowed in with bell photos.

Many areas of the court house has very old electrical wiring and Osborne Electric out of OKC will be replacing most of it over the next 8 or 9 months. George Soter, an Electrical Engineer from Oklahoma City, started the initial work on the court house's electrical needs, and Osborne Electric will be doing the work. Here is a photo I took of Mr. Soter back in July 2001 when he was looking at some of the old panel boxes in the basement that will be replaced. http://www.Oklahomahistory.net/ttphotos/soter2.jpg\n\nLonnie Davis (front) and Rick Scammahorn (rear) boring a 4 inch hole through the first floor to the basement area underneath the courthouse for electrical conduit http://www.Oklahomahistory.net/ttphotos/osborne2.jpg\n\nElectrical box that has just been installed on the first floor http://www.Oklahomahistory.net/ttphotos/osborne3.jpg\n\nMuch of the conduit that will bring the electricity into the court house, must first come in through the dirt floor basement.

It is pretty much finished now, just a little more to do. But one thing I added I think will be very helpful, is a \"How To Find Us\" webpage. It's got directions and maps on how to find your way to the court house, the annex building, the sheriffs office, and the county barns. This will help if you are from out of town. Just go to this link and look near the bottom for \"How To Find Us\". http://www.brightok.net/cartercounty/\n\nSome of you have emailed me saying you tried to pull up photos in old issues of T&Ts using the xoom.com webpage I used long ago. If you are looking for any photos from the xoom.com pages, you should be able to make a correction in the URL, following the example below, and be able to see the pics...... April 1999: \"Got another great photo from Ardmore's past sent in by Robert Hensley. It was taken about 1898 at the corner of Caddo and East Main inside the Dew Drop Inn.

Paramedic Shawn Skelly and critical care medic Shane Gilmore died working an automobile accident in the Arbuckle Mountains last Sunday afternoon.

It stared Warren Oates and used several area extras. I remember seeing Robert Denney, James Clark, the two Bacon Brothers, Wayne Worthen and Henry the man who shined shoes at the Carter County Court House. There were scenes I recognized was at Dougherty and in Ardmore was Caddo and Main. The Chickasaw Lake Club Clubhouse, The Knox Hotel and so on. While one of the Actors was getting his shoes shined at the Court House, he was sitting under a big sign that said Lake Murray and Colverts Dairy. I had that movie but I have lost it, I don't know what happened to it. But I'd like to see it again.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, I can not ever tire of hearing information regarding Washington School. Those were the happiest years of my carefree life. I do remember clearly Miss Ringer and her pictures placed around the room at the blackboards. On Fridays, if it was our day to have art instead of music, Miss Ringer would spend the entire class period telling us the history of the artist and the circumstances of why the particular painting was made. I was literally terrified of Miss Ringer, and only had her for art during the upper elementary school years. I was very poor in art, but out of those years I was able to do two things which she praised to high heaven. One was I was called on to go up the blackboard and take the pointer and name each one of the paintings as well as its painter. I did every painting correctly without even pausing to think. Miss Ringer was so proud of me. Another time, she let us to finger painting with different color paste or some kine of potion she mixed up (remember the sink in the back of her room). My color was green, and near the end of the class she told us to paint a picture for her that would good enough to be posted in her classroom. Well, I could't draw worth a flip, so I quickly thought up the idea to draw a musical staff with a treble cleft, and a couple of sharps or flats as well as a time signature. Miss Ringer was so proud of me, and I actually did a good job that my painting made the group to be hung with the selected ones. She said it was so original as no one else had that idea. I always did better in music with Mrs. Wilna Lasiter, and she was also my 5th grade homeroom teacher. She was a great teacher, and she was not as rough as I feared Miss Ringer might be, and literally could be. Many people have inquired about Mrs. Lasiter and they would say Wilma Lasiter, but her first name was Wilna. At one time she directed the choir at The Calvary Presbyterian Church, and I think she played the piano for a local church. She was a very talented lady and was a very sweet woman. At the end of the school year, she put on the play about the great American composer, George M. Cohen. We practiced all semester on those wonderful patriotic songs. I will never forget that program that the fifth and sixth grade did in May of 1956. I am sure that many of Washington School former students will also remember those extremely nice Christmas treats that the PTA gave each student. I remember Mrs. Gentry very well. Also, Mrs. Smithers who made such lovely chocolate cake on soup day each Wednesday. I would give ten dollars for a piece of cake that taste just exactly like that did. I have never had any just like it flavor wise, and I have even tried to make it myself. I have often wondered if Mrs. Smither would give us the receipe for this cake. I know the school received commodities in those days, therefore real butter was used in our food, and we always had that delicious cheese. In those days, there was no such items as pizza, pigs in a blanket, or chili con carne on our menus at school.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, I am attaching a little dittie that I wrote on Sept 11th last. By coincidence, my oldest son, Don Jr, called me a couple of weeks later and out of the blue said he just wanted to tell me he loved me and to thank me for raising him and providing for him all those childhood years. What a shock! A pleasant one, though, and I thought that your readers in T&T might be happy to hear that a son was so thoughtful. -Don Bridges (Sr, or course) http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/textfiles/memoriesdb.jpg\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Hi Butch, Just read this week's T&T, interesting as usual.

It was taken in the spring of 1943 on the front steps of the Wheeler School building. Teacher was Mary Steele Beaty. Mrs. Beaty's father was the principal. I do not recall his first name. Names were not on the picture, but with some help I have been able to identify many of them. If anyone can help with identities, contact me at suzee54@brightok.net http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/wheel43.jpg\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Butch, I have been reading a book entitled \"Selden Lindsey, U.S. Marshall\". He was from Carter Co OK but lived in close neighboring counties at one time, according to the book which was written by his grandson whose last night is (was) McCullough. I will send you more details after I re-locate the book and scan through it. Anyway, Marshall Lindsey was the person who brought the body of the outlaw, Bill Dalton, to Ardmore OK after Dalton was shot and killed at a place named Elk (?Elk City). Lindsey led a posse to the home of some people by the last name of Wallace, who were giving Dalton and some of his men a place to stay. This was right after a bank in Texas (I believe). Another posse led by a different U.S. Marshall was also in the area. According to the notes by Marshall Lindsey, from which this grandson got his notes, along with a set of notes given by an accompanying posse member Loss Hart, one of Dalton's gang members saw one of the posse members and warned Dalton who came out shooting. Lindsey opened fire and Dalton was shot in the middle of his left chest. Hart who was in a barn, also shot as Dalton was going down and got him in the right side. The body was loaded up in a wagon and driven back to Ardmore. It was a hot day and the body swelled up pretty bad, even though Lindsey stopped on occasion and poured water over it from springs or wells. Apparently, Loss Hart was always given credit for killing him. He did shoot him, but it was not the fatal shot. Neither Lindsey or Hart ever asked for the reward money, which had been about $20,000 - unheard of for that time. I'll write more details when I have time to reread some of the book. Dalton's widow came to pick up her husband's body and stayed in one of the hotels in downtown Ardmore. It was believed that Dalton was trying to amass money and supplies so that he, his wife and their children could escape to Mexico and live there. I just thought this was interesting and adds to our \"frontier\" era in Indian/Oklahoma Territory. There is another book about a U.S. Marshall who served in Ardmore...it's called \"Gunman's Territory\" and is about Marshall Bob Hutchins. These really bring the \"old west\" to life and I'm glad I came across these at the public library.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"I have so many memories of all the trips I made to Devils Den over a 40 year time frame, and would like to talk or email with the present owner.

I live in Thackerville, several of my friends have been to the springs and we have seen many things that cant be explained. Such as little black creatures flying in and out between the trees when really no one is there. We have heard voices and seen nothing. Many things happen there. All of which we have heard and seen at night. I think that some sort of spirit still stays there to watch over the cemetary. It is a proven fact that many bodies have been found there. Several cults have meetings there and crucify bodies. I myself have heard things that make me want to run and never look back. Many times i have been lost and cant find my path when i know it by heart, or thats what we all think until we are there and cant find our way out. We would love to go with you sometime on one of your trips. Many of my friends and i read and look at your web site every day at school. We know what you mean because we have been there and seen things things that cant be explained.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"After having read several things from your Brown Springs web page, i decided to examine this myself. Some of my pupils and i went to the cemetary to further explore the springs. When doing so we found that things happen when it is dark that not even the human eye can explain. I had taken my video camera to hopefully catch some things on tape.While following the path we had come across a copperhead, being afraid that it would bite us we killed it, or my friend wilderness man (Joshbgosh) had smashed its head in. It seemed as if the snake was the gate keeper for the headstone. After killing the snake a headstone fell over by itself, no one had touched it. The indians believe that if an owl crosses your path someone close to you is going to die. While walking further down the path we came upon a white owl sitting in a tree. We shined our light so we could get a better look and when we did the owl flew away not making a sound all of which we have on tape. At this point things began to get very strange. Our light had gone dead and we couldnt see. Trying to find our way out it seemed as if we were going in circles. After a period of running around in the dark we managed to find the fence that led to the way out. As we were walking down the path we heard voices of little girls screaming like they were being hurt. We began to run to our vehicles in panic afraid that they wouldnt be there. As we got to the bottom of the hill we got in our vehicles and left and havent been back since then.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Hi Butch, my name is Dennis Teegardin, in 1965, I dated Jim Ozment's daughter Mae Lynn Ozment, I have tried to find out where she might be, and how she is doing, but have had no success.

Over 4,100 files totaling over 410mgs! And here are those two winners for this week!\n\nschahara@sprynet.com\n\ntommiej@fuse.net\n\n\"History is a relentless master. It has no present, only the past rushing into the future. To try to hold fast is to be swept aside.\" -John Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nSee everyone next Saturday!\n\nButch Bridges\n\nPO Box 2\n\nLone Grove, Oklahoma 73443\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSaturday October 5, 2002 T&T Weekly Vol 6 Issue 285\n\nA Reader reminded me last week about a movie made locally here sometime between 1945 and 1949. The movie was based after the TV show \"The Little Rascals\" but the cast being made up of all local residents. She said the Ritz Theater (117 West Main) would show this movie on a regular basis during those years. I know of one Ardmoreite who \"starred\" in the movie, but I was told she didn't know where a copy of the movie was either. Maybe someone will remember this homespun movie will be remembered by someone out there, and some of the actors in it.\n\nSpeaking of the Little Rascals, there was one Ardmoreite who acted in that national film syndication. I can not think of her name right now, but her son lives in the Gene Autry area. Maybe someone will remember her name.\n\nAnother Reader told me this week about a bubbling spring that in the 40s was behind a house in my stomping grounds on 3rd NE. I told about the spring that used to be behind my grandfather Carmon's lumber yard. But I don't remember the spring that was behind Annie Grider's house in the southwest corner of 3rd and M Street Northeast. The Reader said it bubbled up out of the ground a few hundred feet south-southwest of Annie Grider's home. This would have been out in the wooded area northwest of Cardinal Ball Park.\n\nLast week we talked about the \"wild woman\" Ethel Hindman of the Arbuckle Mountains. I had heard that Ethel Hindman moved on to California to be a stunt woman, but didn't know what ever happened to her out there. A Reader answered that question in the Mailbag below. She died as she lived, always looking for that next rush.\n\nOn September 7th we talked about Magnetic Hill near Springer, Oklahoma. I've heard from several of you, telling me you went out there and check out this mystery. A Reader told me about one office here in town taking their entire staff out there, including a couple of engineers to examine this stretch of Pitt Road where your car seems to roll up hill. She said while they were out there, this one area farmer drove by 3 or 4 times trying to figure out what in the world was going on. I predict teachers will be taking students out to Magnetic Hill as an experimental outing! Here are those photos I took a month ago including a map how to get to Magnetic Hill NW of Springer. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/maghill2.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/maghill3.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/maghill4.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/magmap.jpg\n\nLast Saturday, September 29th, was pickup day for us who participate in the Share Program. Once a month about 70 people from all around this area pickup our groceries behind St Mary's Catholic Church here in Ardmore. I took my camera last Saturday and snapped some photos of the truck being unloaded with the goodies. http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/share9a.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/share9b.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/share9c.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/share9d.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/share9d.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/share9f.jpg http://www.OklahomaHistory.net/ttphotos/share9g.jpg"
