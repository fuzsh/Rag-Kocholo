        "text": "During his lifetime, James Elwood Baillie was an active member of his United Church community of faith in Ottawa. He believed that the future of the church depended upon the involvement of its young people in ministry and the development of their capacity to take on leadership roles. As such, he felt strongly that young people should be encouraged to participate in the witness of the church in the world and recognized for their many valuable contributions. In response to a generous legacy gift he made through his Will, TUCC created The James Baillie Fund to do just that – celebrate and uplift the many important ways in which youth and young adults (aged 13-35) contribute their energy and talents to the church community and beyond.\n\nFund Guidelines\n\nThe Fund is dedicated to supporting youth and young adults aged 13-35 who are members, adherents, or regular attendees of worship services at the United Church of Canada. It is specifically for individuals in need, who must be recommended by a congregation or community of faith. The Fund’s financial support can be used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\nCourses and Training: Funding for courses on biblical studies, life skills, or parenting.\n\nCamping Sponsorships: Financial support for attending camps offered by any UCC camp within the regions served by TUCC.\n\nBasic Necessities: Accessing food and clothing from food/clothing banks operated by the UCC.\n\nEducational Support: Scholarships or bursaries for technical/trade courses or college education.\n\nThere are twelve grants of $1,000 available per youth/young adult. The application process is open from January 2nd to February 15th. Grant recipients will be announced in March/April.\n\nThe application deadline for 2025 is February 15th.\n\nThe full criteria for qualifying projects, and application requirements can be found HERE. Grant applications can be completed online.\n\nFor more information contact Janice Meighan, Director of Fundraising and Donor Care, at janice@tucc.ca or (905) 771-5124 ex. 22.\n\nPrevious Grant Recipients\n\n2022/2023/2024: Rosedale, Bloor Street, and Fairlawn Avenue United Church to support youth attending Gibimishkaadimin, a project of reconciliation engaging Indigenous youth from across Canada and non-Indigenous youth from Shining Waters Regional Council area.\n\nThe Treble Fund came under the care of TUCC in 2012 and is rooted in the heartfelt generosity of Lillian Frances Massey Treble (1854-1915). The founder of the Lillian Massey School of Household Science and Art, Lillian was profoundly concerned for the well-being of families and the nurturing of household arts and sciences. This fund, established through a legacy gift from her estate, embodies her legacy of compassion and care.\n\nGrants for ministries and communities of faith in the City of Toronto are available to assist with practical life skills development in the areas of:\n\nFood preparation\n\nNutrition\n\nSustainable food gardening\n\nFinancial literacy\n\nCrafting and sewing programs\n\nPrevious Grant Recipients\n\n2023: Kimbourne Park United Church to equip the Community Kitchen Food Program.\n\nOne grant of up to $5,000 is available per year. The application process is open from January 2nd to February 15th. Grant recipients will be announced in March/April.\n\nThe application deadline for 2025 is February 15th.\n\nThe full criteria for qualifying projects, and application requirements can be found HERE. Grant applications can be completed online.\n\nFor more information contact Janice Meighan, Director of Fundraising and Donor Care, at janice@tucc.ca or (905) 771-5124 ex. 22.\n\nThe Leslie and Anna Davenport Funds consist of both loans and grants. The Davenport Funds stand as a testament to the power of generosity and collective action in creating positive change in ministry and the broader community.\n\nEstablished in January 1990 from a generous legacy gift, these funds were entrusted to the care and stewardship of TUCC. The grants, sourced from the Davenport Interest Fund, serve as a beacon of hope and support for social ministry initiatives. These initiatives are instrumental in addressing social challenges and advancing the welfare of those in need within the regions TUCC serves.\n\nPrevious Grant Recipients\n\n2023: Islington United Church and Trinity St. Paul’s United Church for mural projects by Indigenous artists.\n\n2021-2022: Filipino Christian Fellowship for their newcomers’ program\n\n2019: Eastminister United Church for a kitchen program and renovation\n\n2018/2019: Great Lakes Water Walk\n\n2018: Gumboot Productions to complete the film “Finding Peter Bryce.”\n\n2017: Le Ministère Protestante Francophone de Toronto\n\n1996 – 2012: Variety of community relief projects\n\nThis is an open grant application process.
