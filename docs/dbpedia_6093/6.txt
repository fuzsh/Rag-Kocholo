We are happy to announce the start of our cooperation with Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University: from now on, the educational institution's students and employees enjoy an unlimited access to our bibliographic management service. Our aim is to implement a top-quality automated system of referencing and citations which would allow adopting a unified approach to the creation of lists of references in students' papers and scientific articles written within the university.

We invite all educational institutions to join our cooperation programme: https://www.grafiati.com/partner-universities/. For universities, we offer premium access and full support, as well as the opportunity to develop individual citation styles or customise the ones available on our website. Contact us to discuss the details and get a free trial access.
