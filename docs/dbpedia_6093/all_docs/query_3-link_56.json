Kaner was born in Kharkov on November 19, 1931. In 1954 he graduated from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Kharkov State University. Besides the diploma on the basic specialty âtheoretical physicsâ, he defended an experimental thesis on optics. Further, during the whole his scientific activity, E.A. Kaner was interested in experiments and much collaborated with experimenters.\n\nE.A. Kaner was one of brilliant representatives of the theoretic school by I.M. Lifshits. The most important E.A. Kanerâs investigations refer to the theory of plasma phenomena in metals. Due to the discovery of cyclotron resonance and other his works in this area, the conventional notions on a metal as a medium where any propagation of electromagnetic oscillations is impossible have been revised. E.A. Kaner predicted the existence of different types of such oscillations able to propagate deep into the metal, he revealed a new mechanism of their absorption (so-called Landauâs magnetic damping), developed the theoretical concepts on the single-particle ballistic mechanism for metals anomalous transparency.\n\nOne of the first, E.A. Kaner began the investigations on magnetic acoustics of metals. He predicted the acoustical cyclotron and helicon-phonon resonances, the resonance in open orbits, giant quantum oscillations of sound speed, strong non-adiabatic effects under the electron-ion interactions; he developed the theoretical basis for the magnetic acoustic-electronics of metals on Rayleigh waves.\n\nE.A. Kaner contributes much into the development of the problem of instability and propagation of waves in semiconductor and gas-discharge plasma â predicted a helicoid instability of coupled sound and spiral electromagnetic waves, developed the theory of a new type cyclotron parametric instability in semiconductors.\n\nThe productive scientific ideas by E.A. Kaner were realized in the statistical theory of radio-waves propagation in the turbulent troposphere and wave scattering at hydro-meteors, in the area of radio-location, and other areas of the modern radio-physics. Last his years E.A. Kaner actively studied the magneto-impurity waves in metals, the problem of a magnetic breakdown, acoustic properties of low-dimensional disordered systems, non-linear electrodynamics of metals and semiconductors.\n\nE.A. Kaner is the co-author of two fundamental discoveries: 1) The Cyclotron Resonance in Metals (Azbel-Kanerâs resonance), 1966; 2) Electromagnetic Surges in Conducting Medium (anomalous propagation), 1970.\n\nFor the cycle of works on the magneto-acoustical spectroscopy of metals E.A. Kaner was awarded by the State Premium of Ukraine (1980).\n\nFor more than two decades E.A. Kaner carried out an active educational work as the Professor of Kharkov State University. He is the author of general courses on the electrodynamics and on the theory of metals. He developed a lot of tasks for teaching the theoretical physicists also nowadays.\n\nAll the methodical achievements by E.A. Kaner are based, first of all, on his highest professional level as a scientist. The communication with this outstanding scientist, brilliant and widely erudite man was a main stimulus for Kanerâs learners. His principal motto, rather appeal, was the statement: âEvery man should grow over himselfâ.\n\nE.A. Kaner successfully combined his scientific and educational activity with great organization work. He was a member of the editorial board of journals âSolid State Communicationsâ, âPhysics of Low Temperaturesâ, and âUkrainian Physical Journalâ.\n\nE.A. Kaner was a head and an active participant of a lot of scientific seminars. He asserted that the seminar is not a resting-place, but the place for the most intense scientific work. He communicated with young men very much. He considered the scientific activity as the best kind of bringing-up work. His passion and enthusiasm for science influenced much on all his learners (among them there are more than 20 Candidates and 11 Doctors of Sciences) who now actively work in many countries of the world.\n\nAlready for 30 years after E.A. Kanerâs death, the International Jubilee Seminars take place in Kharkov Scientists House every five years, and annual seminars are carried out for his memory in Kharkov National University named after V.N. Karazin.\n\nNovebmer 24, 2016\n\nOn November, 22-23, 2016 the House of Scientists (Kharkiv, Zhen Myronosyts Str., 10) hosted the International Jubilee Seminar âCurrent problems in Solid State Physicsâ, dedicated to the memory of Associate member of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine E. A. Kaner (1931-1986) and 60th anniversary of discovery of Azbel â Kaner cyclotron resonance.\n\nE.A.Kaner is a world-renowned scientist, co-author of two discoveries: the cyclotron resonance, which is now called Azbel â Kaner resonance and the phenomenon of ballistic penetration of the radio waves into metals or so-called Gantmakher â Kaner mode, laureate of the State Prize of the Ukrainian SSR. Kaner worked at the Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences since its foundation in 1955. Since 1965 he was the foundator and the head of the department of the theory of solids, and for many years worked at the Department of Theoretical Physics of Kharkiv University. E.A. Kaner also was the editor of the Â«Solid State CommunicationsÂ» magazine.\n\nFor two days, students and pupils of E.A.Kanerâs students discussed their new results in the theory of electron nanosystem and related areas of theoretical physics.
