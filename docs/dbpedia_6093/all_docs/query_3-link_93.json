        "text": "Russia's War in Ukraine Weekly Panel Discussion October 6, 2023\n\nHistorical Analysis\n\nAlik Gomelsky, talking on “Avraam Shifrin and his archive: Importance of archives for History and Political Science.” Mr. Gomelsky (Toronto, Canada; originally from Kharkiv, Ukraine) is a prolific writer and a historian of Ukrainian-Jewish relationships in 19-20th centuries.\n\nHe dеbunks a lot of stereotyped myths, many promulgated via Russian-Soviet-KGB imperial-colonial narrative. He is the founder and President of Association of International History and Political Science (AIHPS), and a Senior Advisor of Center for Eastern European Democracy (CEED)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/alik.gomelsky.1\n\nAlik’s book “Jewish-Ukrainian Relations. The Twentieth Century” recently made it into a shortlist of the Canadian Peterson Literary Prize:\n\nhttps://www.petersonliteraryfund.com/events-and-info\n\nBy the invitation to cooperate from the Center of Historical Political Science of the Institute of Political and Ethnonational Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Alik completed the manuscript of the book about Avraam Shifrin for the participation in a large-scale publishing project - the book series Political Portraits in the Parliamentary Publishing House of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.\n\nThe manuscript recently achieved a writer's grant from Peterson Literary Foundation along with a manuscript of famous Anne Applebaum.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PetersonLiteraryFund/posts/pfbid08Q32x1y4z39qEYzZwx24APiMkqovZXSbNQurZJe45nhaZagffMcbtBgNZFZsmF4Kl\n\nA man of amazing fate and unwavering will, the son of an 'enemy of the people', a veteran of the Second World War, an officer of the Red Army (he, a 22-year-old boy, at the end the war had a rank of major and was designated as a person with medium level disability), a senior criminal investigator, legal adviser to the Ministry of Armaments of the USSR, an American-Israeli spy who had access to top-secret documents signed by Stalin in the USSR, a prisoner of Gulag for 10 years, a Zionist, publicist, human rights defender, writer, translator, Israeli public and a political figure, an expert on the Soviet penitentiary system, according to the Soviet press, 'enemy of the USSR number 1' - all this is Avraam Shifrin.\n\nThanks to his camp experience, knowledge of a criminologist and own analytical mind, Shifrin became one of the leading authorities in the world on the Soviet system of prisons and labor camps, so he was invited to the US Senate to participate in hearings on these topics.\n\nHis testimony given in February 1973 before the US Senate Subcommittee of the Internal Security and the Congressional Banking and Currency Committee presented the world with the most complete list of Soviet camps at that time. Shifrin's two-day speech was published as a document of the US Senate and was distributed in translations all over the world.\n\nAvraam Shifrin's activism went beyond his postal addresses in the USSR and Israel. He gave lectures in the U.S.A. and Canada. In France, he had organized a car to transport illegal Zionist and anti-Soviet literature past the USSR's iron curtain. In Austria, he met with his contact from the USSR. It was thanks to Avraam Shifrin and his associates' life-risking work, that the western world gained a view of the corrupt Soviet system, of its prisons and work camps via a documentary titled \"Prisonland\" which was illegally recorded with a hidden camera. The 1980 Olympics ushered in an uncommon wave of western tourists to Moscow, who came equipped with a new and unique edition of Avraam's book: \"The First Guidebook to Prisons and Concentration Camps of the Soviet Union\" which led to exposing what a 'free country' looked like in the USSR.\n\nShifrin's war against the USSR found him creating allies and interacting with various anti-Soviet and anti-communist forces worldwide. After being sent to the Gulag, Avraam Shifrin was able to establish an understanding and unification with Ukrainian nationalists and Ukrainian dissidents, who saw him as an indomitable and principled fighter against Soviet rule. Avraam's Jewish self-awareness caused respect and full support from Ukrainians who resonated with the innate drive to protect the right of self-identification and preserve cultural identity in the face of eradication.\n\nAvraam Shifrin's words spoken 50 years ago, tragically echo in today's reality as they resonate with today's deadly war: \"...Ukrainians are alarmed today that the current course of the USSR is aimed at the complete extermination of the Ukrainian people, our brothers, and sisters in Ukraine...\"\n\nMr. Gomelsky was presenting at MUkraine panel twice before,\n\non 9 December 2022 :\n\nhttps://youtu.be/t1GUQapSvtY\n\nand on 17 February 2023:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dNqu8bVlWog\n\nRussia's War in Ukraine Weekly Panel Discussion August 18, 2023\n\nActivism\n\nEkaterina (Katia) Margolis (Venice, Italy), an artist, book illustrator, linguist, culturologist, journalist.

I was born and raised in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. My son was born in Kyiv in 2013 as well. I spent in Ukraine over 30 years and now I am 35 y.o. Every summer I was with my grandparents at their cabin in Bucha.\n\nUnfortunately, Bucha is now familiar in this room to each of you, because of russia committed one of the biggest crimes against humans since Second World War.\n\nI wish you didn’t know word Bucha.\n\nHistory:\n\nAlso, I would like to tell you very briefly about history of modern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine is not “the Ukraine” because it’s a country (we don’t say the Italy, the Germany, the Spain, etc). Ukraine was a part of Soviet Union, but it was existed before Soviet Union and even russia itself. Ukraine existed as a country more then 200 years before moscow. We have our own traditions, our own language – Ukrainian, our currency is Hryvnia. In fact, Ukrainian language shares more in common with European countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic then it does with russia.\n\nAfter Ukraine became independent country in August 1991 we lived as Soviet Union country with a lot of control from moscow.\n\nIt started to change in 2005 with Orange Revolution. Ukrainians, especially young Ukrainians was getting being pride being Ukrainians. This was Ukrainian next step away from russian control. This process became much faster after the next revolution in 2014 when russia attacked and took part of Ukrainian territory for the first time.\n\nFollowing this event it causes restart for Ukrainian economy, politics and government.\n\nOlder people with pro-russian views were pushed away and young people focused on European views took over. These were people grow up in modern Ukraine, just like me. Ukraine is 33 years old, pretty much like me.\n\nUkraine’s Soviet past we read and heard but we never lived in it.\n\nIn my opinion Ukraine is a great success story, we have some problems but it more from older people not from new people.\n\nOne of my friends I was working with became a top manager at The National Bank of Ukraine, another guy became Minister of Economy, another guy became Minister of Transportation. All this people roughly my age, our President Volodymyr Zelensky is only 45 years old. Before he became a President it was possible to see him in clubs and pubs of Kyiv.\n\nSome of my friends started new businesses from zero and became national players.\n\nAnother Ukrainian company named Grammarly, that started at this time, that you probably heard of on TV commercials in the US.\n\nIt was started by two Ukrainian guys, my husband and I almost invested in it. Now it is worth about USD 2 bln, I wish we would have invested. I am telling you this because I think the story of real Ukraine is lost in news.\n\nFinancial report:\n\nI don’t have much time left but let me please share with you one more topic. It is report which my husband, me and our team put together about US funding for the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis report shows what financing US has given to Ukraine, how it has been spent and what US government bodies have oversight on how money is spent. All information we got from American and Ukrainian public financial resources.\n\nMy husband and I are going to DC next week to share this report with Congressman and Senators.\n\nIt is their job to decide how much money give to Ukraine, but we want to make sure to give them clear information what’s going on to avoid faults, rumors, and misinformation.\n\nI have a few copies of this report with me and will be happy to share it with whom is interested in it. Thank you:\n\nBefore I finish, I want to make sure you understand how much people of Ukraine look up to America as a defender of democracy. Here, in Cody, I often hear people saying a lot of negative things about their own country but please remember how lucky you are, you live in a FREE Country that most of the World looks to for leadership.\n\nI know everybody brings America problems and you must be tired of it. But don’t forget how lucky you are to play such a big role in World affairs.\n\nI want to say THANK YOU! Without your help, the country and its people would not exist. Thank you. “\n\nRussia's War in Ukraine Weekly Panel Discussion June 23, 2023\n\nA memorial panel for Dr Sergii Kurbatov who passed away on June 1, 2023. Speakers include Dr Ausra Padskocimaite (Sweden), Dr Pär Gustaffson Kurki (Sweden), Dr Petro Strizhak (Kyiv), Dr Andrei Rogatchevski (Arctic University of Norway), by recorded video.\n\nDr Ausra Padskocimaite (Sweden).\n\nShe wrote on June 4:\n\n“Like everyone else here, I am shocked and heartbroken by Sergiy's sudden passing... We met during his time in Uppsala, where we became what we used to call \"fika (coffee break) friends\". When I visited Kyiv for the first time, Sergiy met me at Boryspil (with flowers!) and took his time to show me around.\n\nWhen the full-scale war started, we kept in touch regularly, and I was amazed at how calm and composed he sounded despite the circumstances. \"Everything is okay - don't worry! Thank you for your support!\" Sergiy responded politely after I messaged him asking whether he and his family were safe after (yet another) missile attack... When he was finally able to come to Uppsala this April, his eyes were shining, but somehow he looked older, more tired... When we saw each other, he handed me Ukrainian chocolate: \"I hope you like it,\" - he said. \"With all that is going on, what kind of person remembers to bring chocolate?!\" I half-joked with tears in my eyes. Sergiy was THAT kind of person. He also was a scholar, a philosopher, a poet, an ambassador for Ukraine (borrowing from you Per Ekman!), a teacher (during our last meeting he told me how proud he was of his students), a colleague, a friend, a brother, a son, a nature lover and much more... And somehow, he was good at all of it. When, after what turned out to be our last fika, we parted ways, we said that we would see each other again soon, either here in Sweden, which he truly loved, or in Kyiv after Ukraine has won the war…\n\n******************\n\n\"Again, someone broke down the clear eternity...\"\n\n(\"Kto-to iasnuiu vechnost' opiat' razlomal\")\n\nSergiy Kurbatov\n\nPlease join us online Friday June 23 at 1 pm EST (20:00 Kyiv time) live at MUkraine discussion group for our 69th weekly meeting.\n\nWe will hold an informal memorial panel for Dr. Sergiy KURBATOV (1971-2023), a polymath academic, a philosopher, and a poet who recently passed away in Kyiv.\n\nWe expect Sergiy's friends and colleagues to join from Kyiv and from Sweden.\n\nDr. Kurbatov spoke twice at our discussion panel:\n\n15 July 2022: https://youtu.be/iSruqSqwapo\n\n14 April 2023: https://youtu.be/fvGA-9r-f3M\n\nDr. Kurbatov worked at the Kyiv National Economic University and the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine. He was a former guest researcher at Uppsala Centre for Russian Studies, Uppsala University, Sweden. His academic interests included the process of internationalization of contemporary universities, the problem of ranking of universities, influence of education on state policy and state-building in post-Soviet states, the processes of shaping elite, cross-ethnical relations and electoral behavior in Ukraine.\n\nVery early in the war, his article appeared in The Guardian:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/resident-describes-life-in-kyiv-ukraine-russia\n\nSergiy wrote: \"I have many friends internationally and they have expressed so much solidarity with us. The most positive thing to have come out of the war is our increased unity. We are strong here in Kyiv. The outside world cannot see all of the resolve and determination of Ukrainians\" (15 March 2022)\n\nOther tributes to Dr. Kurbatov can be found at his Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/sergiy.kurbatov\n\nSergiy KURBATOV\n\nWords slip away returning to their limits,\n\nI try to trust the emptiness of the city,\n\nbut, groping for gaps in bustling crowd of people,\n\nthis autumn knocks again on open doors.\n\nLeaves fall again - their gold will drive you mad,\n\nthey braid our sadness and our sudden whims.\n\nAgain, someone broke down the clear eternity,\n\nand the inevitable comes with tune of death.\n\nSteps vanish now in the yellowed grass,\n\ntheir sound the last echo of forgiveness,\n\nand here below my darkness turns to light\n\nand glorifies the moment of return.\n\n(transl. by Victor Fet, 2023)\n\nСергей КУРБАТОВ\n\n***\n\nRussia's War in Ukraine Weekly Friday Panel Discussion February 17, 2023\n\nHistorical Analysis\n\nAlik Gomelsky\n\n(Toronto, Canada; originally from Kharkiv)\n\nMr. Gomelsky is a prolific writer and a historian of Ukrainian-Jewish relationships in 19-20th centuries.

Shifrin's two-day speech was published as a document of the US Senate and was distributed in translations all over the world.\n\nAvraam Shifrin's activism went beyond his postal addresses in the USSR and Israel. He gave lectures in the U.S.A. and Canada. In France, he had organized a car to transport illegal Zionist and anti-Soviet literature past the USSR's iron curtain. In Austria, he met with his contact from the USSR.\n\nIt was thanks to Avraam Shifrin and his associates' life-risking work, that the western world gained a view of the corrupt Soviet system, of its prisons and work camps via a documentary titled \"Prisonland\" which was illegally recorded with a hidden camera. The 1980 Olympics ushered in an uncommon wave of western tourists to Moscow, who came equipped with a new and unique edition of Avraam's book: \"The First Guidebook to Prisons and Concentration Camps of the Soviet Union\" which led to exposing what a 'free country' looked like in the USSR.\n\nShifrin's war against the USSR found him creating allies and interacting with various anti-Soviet and anti-communist forces worldwide.

NJ, sociologist):\n\n\"IF PUTIN WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM POWER, HE WILL COMMIT SUICIDE\"\n\nHow the War in Ukraine Can Turn into a War in Russia. Before leaving Russia in 2015 and joining Rutgers University in the US, Sergei Erofeev was a pioneer of post-Soviet global education and cultural sociology.\n\nAs a concert pianist by first training, he has worked in the area of the sociology of the arts. As a scholar of cultural industries and policies, nationalism and ethnicity, as well as post-socialist transformation in general, he has led many large-scale international projects funded by various European and American foundations. His expertise in organizing international research and university reform derives from his work as a vice president of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, which used to be the leading Russian university, the dean of International Programs at the European University at Saint Petersburg, and the founding director of the Center for the Sociology of Culture at Kazan Federal University, Tatarstan, Russia. He has served as a co-principal investigator of the Atlantic Council’s project “Putin Exodus” (2019) devoted to the new wave of Russian emigration and the principal investigator of the comparative project “Tectonic Value Shifts” devoted to uncovering the dynamics of cultural and political change through qualitative sociological research based on biographical interviews.\n\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Putin-Exodus.pdf\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sergei-erofeev-5aa0595\n\nSee his interviews:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxjPJjNO-eo\n\nhttps://tvpworld.com/62761455/putins-elite-is-disturbed-sergei-erofeev-for-tvp-world\n\nHow the War in Ukraine Can Turn into a War in Russia\n\nSergei Erofeev, a research professor at Rutgers University and a senior fellow at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies, has bad news for those who think that for Putin everything boils down to the war in Ukraine and that with its end there will be peace\n\nPredetermined defeat in Ukraine – and it's only a matter of time and price – does not mean the end of the current devastating war. Putin has empirically proved that he will fight until he is removed from power. A palace coup in the current situation is too hypothetical, premature suicide through the use of nuclear weapons on the battlefield is even worse, and a return to the pre-war state equaling admission of defeat is impossible. This means that the war – in one form or another – will move to Russian territory.\n\nPutin's withdrawal from Ukraine can be presented and propagated by the state media as a mix of sensible retreat and victory. It can be said that, in the course of his ”special military operation”, Putin has somehow defeated Nazism or something else equally or almost equally important, while, at the same time, having solved certain Russia’s problems, for example, the problem of lack of patriotism. It is important to understand that having forgotten about the existence of such an enemy as Ukrainians (for him it has always been temporary, situational and, despite the actual horror, instrumental), Putin will throw his last forces into a war with his archenemy – the Russian people.\n\nThis is destined to happen: Putin’s attempts to move to full-fledged mobilization without which he simply has insufficient resources to endure, will also mean mobilization of his opponents.\n\nWhat Russians is Putin going to fight? The answer has long been there: all those who are against him. This war is already underway, the only questions being about the degree of, as some political commentators say, its hybridity and about the growth in the number of Putin’s active opponents. The transition from informational autocracy to an attempt to establish a totalitarian order has already been completed with independent media destroyed and key opponents imprisoned or exiled. This attempt is doomed to fail but it is going to bring troubles to the Russian society comparable to war or, indeed, being a civil war. To fully unleash this new stage of the current war, Putin – provided that the current structure of his personal security remains unchanged – needs to transfer all loyal and combat-ready forces, including parts of his army, to the streets of Russian cities.\n\nWill this involve actual military clashes with self-organized civil groups and army splinter units? Right now, this can only be speculated about. It is clear that Putin’s last resources will be spent on those who will fight for him in one form or another until they reconsider the costs and benefits of their actions.\n\nPutin's power system has already changed its operational regime twice – in 2011-12 and in 2020. The next regime change can be presented by him as a transition from the “special military operation” in Ukraine to a \"counter-terrorist operation\" within Russia. We can already see its rehearsal in Belarus. Putin's new plan may be based on fighting “terrorist attacks” of the “Anglo-Saxons” supported by \"Ukrainian diversionists\" and \"the wrong Russians”. Almost anything will be possible to be presented as such attacks – from the work of lawyers to arsons of governmental offices, from the mobilized civilians’ riots to Internet resistance, and from transportation sabotage to open armed skirmishes.\n\nPutin is losing his main weapon of “cooking the frog of the Russian people\" slowly because history is accelerating. Until the mobilization was announced, he had managed to avoid radically shocking the society from the break of his long-term contract with it. Neither the pension reform nor the full-scale aggression against Ukraine served as such a shock. But Putin still runs the other important shock-mitigating instrument which is lies and euphemisms. Therefore, he will disguise the transfer of the war to his own territory with the help of propaganda and avoid declaring full martial law openly since it would imply a possibility of defeat. Enemy actions on the Russian territory will have to be presented as rather massive but, at the same time, marginal to avoid admitting that there is a civil war with his own people or that some Anglo-Saxons are already there.\n\nTo ensure temporary success, Putin will have to disrupt the remaining normal work of all civil and economic structures from education to business, and fully subdue the \"creative class\" and wage workers’ organizations. But the main danger for him will be – at least at first – not even the open armed resistance but the structural condition of his bureaucracy. It is the Russian bureaucrats and not the security forces, not to mention the \"intelligentsia\", who represent the backbone of the country. It is in this domain that critical sabotage is possible in a variety of forms and on every level – from a passport-issuing officer to a school principal and from housing infrastructure workers to managers of state-owned enterprises, governors and ministers.\n\nIt may sound paradoxical, but it is Putin's open war against the Russians as a future modern nation (it does not matter whether it will eventually become a confederation or not) can give them a chance to atone for what Russia is doing in Ukraine, free Northern Eurasia of Russian imperialism and rid the whole world of further nuclear blackmail. Some Russians may soon respond to Putin’s war quite radically – so that their historical guilt is fully redeemed. This may incur enormous losses possibly exceeding those of the Ukrainians, but this may be how the century-long Civil War in the Eastern European space can eventually end.\n\nWhile, at the moment, such a scenario may seem no more likely than a palace coup against Putin, it may be a way for the Russian society to radically change itself for the better in a relatively short time, but it may come at a price of numerous victims among the general population. There is hardly any doubt that Putin is ready for that: he started his war in Ukraine not only to solve the legitimacy problem in the face of future presidential elections, but also to show his own people what he can physically do to them to preserve his power system.\n\nPutin's general power retention resources seem to currently exceed the costs of his defeat in Ukraine. This means that it is unlikely to avoid a war within Russia. However, this transferred war can be made less bloody. How to achieve this is to be discussed separately."
