        "text": "3.1 The Role of Libraries in Digital Humanities\n\nAs noted earlier, the mission of libraries is to meet the information needs of their users, it is important for modern academic librarians to understand the current issues of DH. Despite the prospect of using many new methods, practices and digital technologies [2], DH researchers face many barriers. These obstacles are primarily due to the fact that DH is still in the process of formation. While some researchers consider DH to be a well-established scientific discipline and appeal to numerous new specialized publications, obtained grant funding, implemented projects and vacancies [18], other scientists are much more cautious in their conclusions and point to the interdisciplinary nature of scientific projects and research in the field of DH.\n\nInformation technology itself is often a tool, an object of research, a research environment, so it is quite difficult to give an unambiguous definition of DH and today this term can be used in different meanings [23]. Also, new digital research methods are not always unambiguously positively perceived by scientists themselves. Not all scientists have felt the urgent need to integrate new digital tools into their research process [1], and therefore such scientists may be skeptical about the prospects for the development of DH as a separate scientific discipline.\n\nHowever, regardless of how scientists perceive DH (as an established discipline, or simply as a set of convenient digital technologies), researchers agree that the work in DH is mainly related to such areas as: digitization, crowdsourcing, databases, digital curation, texts, editing, visualization, geospatial, gaming and code [7, 18]. Each of these key areas of DH has its own history of origin and development, but at the present stage, these areas are often combined to create new dynamic opportunities for the development of DH information resources and services in academic libraries.\n\nLibrary science is very frequently mentioned in the context of DH and all researchers unanimously agree that academic libraries play a very important role in DH, regardless of the reasons for this connection [19]. Today, research libraries can successfully support research in DH, using existing developments to ensure the preservation, access and support of users of scientific and cultural collections, as well as providing physical and virtual spaces and tools for researchers, communities and volunteers. It is the development of active working collaboration with researchers that is a productive way to involve the library in the implementation of influential digital DH projects. At the same time, libraries do not need to be radically transformed to perform the relevant tasks of the DH project. It is enough for libraries to strategically focus their work on those areas of work in which they have already succeeded, and additionally offering partner researchers access to their infrastructure. In addition, research shows that with its stable infrastructure, libraries can help maintain uninterrupted access to ongoing DH projects and research results even after the end of the project [12], which is in the interests of the scientific community and regional communities for whom these projects are valuable.\n\nIdentifying the needs of researchers is an important task for the head of the research library, who has decided to take care of DH. As a rule, each research library already provides users with resources and services that meet the needs of DH to some extent. Thus, scientific libraries can store and organize various special collections of books, periodicals and other materials on the Humanities, digitize these library collections to facilitate the work of users, as well as to analyze large volumes of text using computer algorithms. Also in many scientific libraries there is a position of subject librarians [13, 27], who help scientists at different stages of their research. Traditionally, academic librarians provide services for collecting scientific literature and open data for researchers. And these things are also necessary when implementing DH projects in the library. Similarly, researchers may need access to specialized software or equipment, for example, to collect, analyze, visualize, and store scientific big data. The research library may share existing equipment, or use unused server space, organize training on the use of specific software or tools, or try to submit a joint grant project with researchers to obtain the necessary equipment.\n\nScientists working in a variety of scientific disciplines often depend on research services provided by government and commercial institutions. In this regard, various forms of inter-institutional scientific cooperation are very common today. Researchers that working in the Humanities have long-standing partnerships with academic libraries [21] and DH can give a new impetus to the development of library services and collaboration between librarians and humanities scholars. Many Ukrainian academic libraries also actively implement and offer new services for scientists [16], although most often of these services are universal and aimed at meeting the needs of scientists in different fields, not only for the Humanities.\n\nThe implementation of DH services in the work of scientific libraries requires, first of all, the availability of qualified staff with relevant skills. If earlier a significant part of research in the field of DH was related to text analysis [3], today researchers pay a lot of attention to non-textual materials, and this requires the use of various tools and relevant knowledge about their application. However, according to research, educational initiatives to train professionals to support DH projects have begun around the world relatively recently [5] and discussions are underway on a set of competencies for DH professionals [28]. At the same time, DH offers a new, interesting approach that can be useful both for the development of humanities research and for the transformation of library services. Therefore, it is necessary to fully support these processes, in particular as part of research activities of the university.\n\n3.2 Citizen Science, Citizen Humanities and Gamification\n\nAccording to the generally accepted notion: scientists are by all means trained specialists who work in appropriate institutions and use special equipment. Accordingly, in order to become a scientist, you need to obtain the appropriate education, and people without special education cannot become direct participants in the process of acquiring new knowledge. However, the relationship between scientists and the public is now actively developing using new approaches, including crowdsourcing and crowdsolving. Also, a new vision of Open Science has been formed, which envisages a departure from the research culture, which focused its attention primarily on the final results. Instead, under the new Open Science approach, every step of research and data can be traced, verified, and reproduced.\n\nToday, in many disciplines, scientists have managed to accumulate such large amounts of initial data that they are extremely difficult to analyze for a few scientists. At the same time, the development of computer technology has led to the fact that many users have tools with which they can conduct research without special education and technology. Thus, scientists began to use the practice of transferring some scientific activities to a large network of volunteers [22], and such scientific research that conducted entirely or partially by non-professional scientists is called “Citizen Science” (hereafter CS) [8]. This practice has its advantages. First, one can try to use the “wisdom of the crowd” and hope that a large group of people will do the job better than a limited number of professionals. Scientists can also use numerous volunteers to share routine tasks that cannot be automated. The combined strategies are often used, for example, in libraries when it is necessary to process large open electronic collections and improve the quality of metadata documents in these collections [25].\n\nNew trends and practices related to Open Science are actively developing in the Humanities, and CS in the humanities has even received a separate term – Citizen Humanities (hereafter CH) [24]. The use of practices that are now associated with CH has a long tradition in the Humanities. In contrast to the Natural sciences, where research results are usually disseminated in specialized journals among a narrow audience of specialists, the Humanities, on the other hand, address a wide audience through various channels of communication and the use of local languages. The development of digital technologies and DH tools has simply opened up new ways to involve citizens in the Humanities, to study cultural heritage, archives and libraries. Thus, CH can combine current public interests with scientific research, while gaining new knowledge, and at the same time explain to the public the need for the Humanities sciences for society.\n\nThe most common CH practices cover tasks related to the transcription of texts and the description of artifacts, which allows researchers to more quickly obtain the necessary information, as well as to identify new connections between the studied objects. Many components are required for the successful implementation of CS initiatives, but one of the main challenges is to attract numerous participants and motivate their active and long-term participation. In recent years, various CS projects have resorted to various gamification tools – attempts to make research tasks more like games, using a variety of game elements, including assessment and competition with other participants [22]. Presenting scientific information in research projects in this way makes the task more attractive in the eyes of the participants, promotes the involvement of activists, and encourages the public to long-term interaction and participation in research."
