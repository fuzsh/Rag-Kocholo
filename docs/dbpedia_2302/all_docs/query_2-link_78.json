        "text": "The 2022-23 Mustang Boys Basketball team took the motto STEP UP. Expectations were not overly high as we entered our 1st season of 4A basketball with only one returner with significant experience from our Class 3A State Championship season the year before. This year’s Mustang squad wanted to prove the doubters wrong and show we could compete with the best.\n\nThe season started with a dramatic 2 point win against rival ADM, highlighted by a last-second game-winning shot by Senior Hudson Ehlert. A 32-point win against Grinnell at home, followed by a tough loss at home to an excellent, senior-led Newton team. The Mustangs won their next 3 games before the holiday break, capped off with a three-point win against perennial 4A powerhouse Johnston. The Johnston contest was probably the best overall game we played all year as the ball was moving on offense and our defense made everything tough for the Dragons. It is always nice to enter the holiday break with a solid 5-1 record.\n\nWe entered the new year with a tough road opponent in the Norwalk Warriors. The year before, the Mustangs won both contests going to 3 overtimes at their place and 4 overtimes later in the year. No overtime was needed this time in a 57 to 46 DCG win. A home game followed against another 4A opponent the highly-ranked Indianola Indians. This time it was DCG on the end of a heartbreaking loss as Indianola hit a game-winner with little time left. A vastly improved Pella Christian (State semi-finalist) team hit 11 three-pointers in the 1st half, going into halftime with a 43 to 18 halftime lead. We fought back and made it a game but never got over the hump losing by 11. We responded well with an impressive 19-point win at Pella but couldn’t get it done at Ankeny losing 63-58 in a competitive game. We ended up sweeping Grinnell with a nice 15-point win on the road but Grandview Christian (state champs) proved too much for us as we didn’t shoot it great and their length proved too much in a 20-point loss (in the Gilbert Jamboree). We fought hard at Newton in a 58-52 loss and responded with 41 point win vs. Osky at home.\n\nThe low point on our horseshoe analogy was our game at home against Norwalk in which we played a flawless 1st half, up 16. Norwalk gained momentum in the 2nd half and ended up beating us in overtime with a great comeback. Indianola handled us at home easily and we needed to regroup. This low point was similar to the weekend we had in the 21/22 season where we were blown out at Indianola and upset by Boone. You either win or you learn. It is how you respond to adversity that matters in basketball and in life. Last year’s team responded by not pointing fingers, by practicing with greater intensity, and by being determined to write their own story which culminated in a state championship. This year’s squad did the same thing. We spoke a lot about accountability, attitude, and how to handle setbacks. Our guys played great basketball to end the regular season starting with a 32-point win at Pella Christian. We wore ties as this was a business trip. Our guys owned their performance against PC earlier in the year and were determined to go to Pella Christian and play with Mustang heart and intensity. We then defeated Pella by 15 to earn an impressive sweep of the Dutch. North Polk exposed some weaknesses we had and defeated us in a close game. We learned from this game and came back stronger defeating tradition rich Ballard by 17 to end the regular season. Lessons we learned in the regular season would help us as we started our 1st journey in the 4A post-season.\n\nThe Mustangs were seeded 3rd in Substate 8 which meant we did not get a bye, but did get a final home game vs. Des Moines North which was special. North came out on fire but we stayed the course and did not get rattled. We played with poise and composure and knew if we stuck with it, the Polar Bears would cool off. They did and we made winning plays down the stretch to help us advance.\n\nRound 2 meant traveling to Council Bluffs to take on a tough and physical 14-6 Council Bluff Lincoln team. Again, we got down early but persevered and made an incredible comeback from down double digits in the 2nd half. A tough baseline basket by Sophomore Tate Perrin gave us a three point lead late which proved to be enough as DCG advanced with a 57-54 win. We were the heavy underdog in the Substate final as #2 Waukee (22-2), led by McDonald’s All-American Omaha Billew. We were punched in the mouth early as Waukee scored the 1st ten points but we started to fight back and had a few shots fall. We went to locker room cutting the Waukee halftime lead to 5 (25-20). The Mustangs played an inspiring 2nd half cutting the lead to 4 with a few chances late but couldn’t get the big shot to fall. It was a fantastic defensive effort as we held Waukee to a season low at the time (49 points). Omaha was held to 15. Our guys not only competed with Waukee, we really believed we would win. The state took notice that DCG would be a player in 4A basketball. Our guys played like the champions they are and our coaching staff could not be prouder of their efforts.\n\nThe 22-23 DCG Mustangs ended the season with an impressive 14 win total. We were 4th in the Little Hawkeye with an 8-6 record ending the season in the Substate Finals. We broke a team record for foul shooting as our team shot 74%, surpassing the previous record of 68%.\n\nMore important than records and statistics, were the memories and relationships that were made. Our team had 7 special seniors in Trey, Hudson, York, Drew, Josh, Jackson and Mitchell. These unselfish individuals represented DC-G with integrity and class on and off the court. We appreciate their commitment to the Mustang Basketball program. They have certainly left their jerseys in a better place. We are confident that these 7 seniors will have great success in the future and make the world a better place.\n\nWe look towards the 23-24 season with optimism and excitement. A strong core return that gained valuable experience this season. They love the game and are committed to playing the Mustang Way.\n\nDCG MUSTANG BASKETBALL\n\n2022-23\n\n“STEP UP”\n\n4A SUBSTATE 8 RUNNER-UP\n\n14 WINS (8-6 in LITTLE HAWKEYE = 4th Place)\n\n* SWEEPS OVER PELLA, OSKALOOSA and GRINNELL.\n\nWIN OVER TOP 10 in 4A NORWALK, JOHNSTON (4A), LAST 2nd WIN over ADM, DISTRICT WINS OVER DM NORTH and ROAD DISTRICT WIN AT COUNCIL BLUFFS LINCOLN, 17 POINT WIN OVER BALLARD,\n\n32 POINT PAYBACK WIN @ PELLA CHRISTIAN,\n\n13 POINT WIN OVER STATE TOURNEY TEAM DM CHRISTIAN\n\nBC MOORE #16 RANKING (16 of 48 4A Teams)\n\nSCORED 58.79 POINTS a GAME (26th of 48 4A Teams)\n\nDEFENSIVE AVERAGE 53.79 (14th of 48 4A Teams)\n\n74.4% FT% – NEW SCHOOL RECORD\n\nVarsity Roster\n\nTrey Hartman\n\nMitchell Bridie\n\nCalix Cahill\n\nOwen Vasey\n\nJackson Dornsbach\n\nJackson Green\n\nJonathon Howard\n\nHudson Ehlert\n\nBrogan Fuller\n\nJosh Harestad\n\nJaden Jones\n\nYork Meggison\n\nTate Perrin\n\nDrew Rankin\n\nJV Roster\n\nJackson Dornsbach\n\nKelly Ebanda\n\nBrogan Fuller\n\nTrey Hartman\n\nJosh Harestad\n\nMason Heath\n\nSpencer Parrish\n\nLukas Smock\n\nOwen Vasey\n\nMANAGERS\n\nLaura Klaessy\n\nRylynn Nelson\n\nHailee Anderson\n\nVARSITY “SPIRIT” AWARD\n\nHudson Ehlert\n\nTHE BRODY FREKING “PERSEVERANCE” AWARD\n\nDrew Rankin and Mitchell Bridie\n\nVARSITY SPORTSMANSHIP AWARD\n\nYork Meggison\n\nCOACHES AWARDS\n\nJunior Varsity – Owen Vasey and Brogan Fuller\n\nVarsity – Hudson Ehlert\n\nIBCA TEAM FIRST AWARD\n\nYork Meggison\n\nVARSITY MOST IMPROVED\n\nKelly Ebanda\n\nSCHOLAR ATHLETE\n\nSENIOR – York Meggison\n\nJUNIOR – Jaden Jones\n\nACADEMIC ALL-CONFERENCE (3.5 and Varsity player)\n\nMadison Bridie\n\nHudson Ehlert\n\nBrogan Fuller\n\nJosh Harestad\n\nJonathon Howard\n\nJaden Jones\n\nYork Meggison\n\nTate Perrin\n\nDrew Rankin\n\nOwen Vasey\n\nACADEMIC ALL-STATE\n\nHudson Ehlert\n\nACADEMIC ALL-DISTRICT 8 (Selected by the IBCA Committee)\n\nTEAM GPA 3.76\n\nLITTLE HAWKEYE ALL- CONFERENCE SELECTIONS\n\nCalix Cahill – 1st Team\n\nHudson Ehlert – 2nd Team\n\nJonathon Howard – 2nd Team\n\nJaden Jones – Honorable Mention\n\nTate Perrin – Honorable Mention\n\nALL DISTRICT SUBSTATE 8\n\nCalix Cahill\n\nDCG MILESTONES\n\n12th in last 14 years DCG Varsity Basketball has had a winning record\n\n10th time in last 14th year DCG Varsity boys have advanced to the Sub-state FInal\n\nDCG RECORDS BROKEN/TIED\n\nHudson Ehlert – Breaks School Record for FT % for a season (22-23) = (63-75) 84%\n\nJonathan Howard – 2nd in School History for 3pters in a season = 55\n\nHighest F.T. % in school history = (233-313) 74.4%"
