DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Monday, June 1, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate a great Iowa company, Doll Distributing Beverage Company of Council Bluffs, Iowa. Doll Distributing is celebrating its 50th anniversary in business. Their motto is: ``Building Brands. Building Relationships.'' Doll Distributing is a distributor of Anheuser-Busch and other products. Merlin Doll's sales and wholesaling career spanned over 60 years starting with the Storz Brewery in Omaha as a territory sales manager. Mr. Doll wanted to purchase a distributorship and when none were available he was approached by Anheuser-Busch and was given an opportunity to purchase one. In 1965 Mr. Doll, with his wife Edith, sold their distributorship in order to purchase a distributing operation in Council Bluffs, Iowa, the Doll Distributing of today. The second generation, which includes: Jeff Doll, Mark Doll, Tami Doll, Scott Doll and Jay Doll, purchased the company from their parents. Since 1988 they have expanded the [[Page E808]] business from distributing in 3 counties to 11 counties, and after several additional purchases of distributing operations, the Doll Family distributes their products to over 40 counties, amounting to 3,569 accounts in Iowa. Andrew Doll and Lauren Doll are continuing the Doll family tradition as the third generation currently involved in the business. The Doll Distributing Beverage Company has made a positive impact on the Council Bluffs community and the State of Iowa. For the past 50 years the Doll Family has accomplished a number of milestones and are a true testament to the meaning of hard work and dedication to success. I commend Doll Distributing and their employees for a job well done. I know that my colleagues in the House join me in honoring this company and family for their commitment to business and their community. I wish them and their employees continued success moving forward. ____________________"
