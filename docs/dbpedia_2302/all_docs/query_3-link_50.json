        "text": "April 25, 1921 – June 2, 2022\n\nLloyd Darwin Banks, 101, passed away peacefully on June 1, 2022 in Council Bluffs. A Celebration of Life visitation was held June 4 at Peterson Mortuary in Glenwood. A private interment will be held at a later date at Glenwood Cemetery.\n\nLloyd was born April 25, 1921 in Dumont, to Harry R. and Sirene A. Banks. Lloyd spent most of his childhood in Creston where at the age of 12 he had landed a part-time job sorting and stacking bread and baked items at local grocery stores for Colonial Baking. He graduated from Creston High School and started working for CB &Q railroad also known as Burlington Route, which later became Burlington Northern. This developed a passion for collecting railroad antiques and memorabilia, which is all being donated to the Mills County Historical Society.\n\nLloyd was united in marriage to Evelyn Marie Gray on June 15, 1947 in Algonac, Mich. To this union two sons were born, Larry and Jerry. Lloyd started his home building and real estate adventure in 1961. He worked as both a homebuilder and on the railroad until 1973 when he retired from the railroad. In 1985 Lloyd sold his Glenwood real estate business. He continued to build homes in Council Bluffs until the age of 96. He remained active in many community service organizations both in Glenwood and Council Bluffs.\n\nLloyd’s motto to living a good life was to have a positive attitude and love people. He was a great storyteller and had that twinkle in his eye while doing so. His memory will live on through his family and friends forever.\n\nPreceding Lloyd in passing were his parents, his brother Dr. Keith Banks and his son Larry.\n\nSurvivors include his loving wife Evelyn of 74 years, son Jerry Banks of Glenwood; grandchildren Sheila Marquez of Walnut Creek, Calif.; Kelley (Mike) Green of LaVista, Neb.; Lindsay (Darren) Cunningham of LaVista, Neb.; nine great-grandchildren; two nieces, one nephew, extended relatives and friends.\n\nMemorial donations may be directed to the Glenwood Public Library, 109 North Vine Street, Glenwood, Iowa or the Lloyd and Evelyn Banks Endowment Fund at the Council Bluffs Community Foundation, which will benefit libraries in Southwest Iowa."
