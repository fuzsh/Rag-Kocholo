        "text": "Rotary District 5650 Governor Carol Horner visited Seward Rotary Club on October 6, 2021\n\nCarol Horner, 2021-22 District 5650 Governor, held her official visit to Seward Rotary Club on October 6, 2021. Horner, a member of Council Bluffs Noon Rotary Club in Council Bluffs, Iowa, met with the Club's Board of Directors prior to the weekly meeting.\n\nHorner was introduced by Seward Rotary President, Dr. Matt Dominy, and discussed the 2021-22 Rotary International theme, âServe to Change Lives!â She commented that she has been District Governor for three month, noting that it sometimes feels like two weeks and sometimes two years, and shared her observations so far as District Governor.\n\nFirst, Rotarians are amazing, The passion, the drive, the desire to make our communities and work a better place is abundant. âService Above Selfâ isnât just a motto, it is in our DNA and Rotary makes an impact Worldwide!\n\nShe also saluted local Rotary Club Presidents. It is not an easy job sometimes âherdingâ Rotary Club members, but it is very rewarding and worth the effort. She reminded all of the Rotary membership to thank their Club President and encouraged the membership to each consider being President of the local Seward Rotary Club. She also complimented her Area Rotary Governors, who assist her with many of the day to day details and offer the direct contact and support needed by any leader.\n\nShe reminded the Rotary Club membership that the many, many District Chairmen are working for the clubs to achieve the goals established early on by the District. She invited the Seward members to get involved with a District Team and to invited some of the District Committee Chairs to attend the Seward meeting and present their efforts to date.\n\nShe commented that âpatienceâ is not her âlong suitâ but it is necessary at District Governor. With so much to accomplish, sometimes pacing is not as fast as it should or could be at times. She noted also that âdetailsâ are not a âlong suitâ of hers, but the details are so important in everything we accomplish successfully.\n\nShe applauded the Club on surviving and even flourishing during the recent Pandemic and complemented the club on a host of their community service and international service projects-recognized as âOutstanding at the District and Internationalâ Levels.\n\nRotarian Greg Zabka presented the District Governor with a bag of gifts representing the local Seward Region and invited her back to attend another Seward Rotary Club meeting."
