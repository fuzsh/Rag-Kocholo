        "text": "Giving at Home and Beyond\n\nStephanie is a woman of many accomplishments, but she sees her greatest accomplishment to be starting and raising a family with her husband, Rocky. Stephanie is the proud mother of one handsome boy, one beautiful girl, and two energetic “cuddle-pups” she rescued. She loves working as a team with her husband to take care of her boisterous bundles of energy, whether they have two legs or four!\n\nStephanie also believes in being the change in the world, following the motto: “Anger is a waste of energy, and meanness is the worst sin.” For the Veterans who’ve suffered from the world’s anger, she’s determined to show them the care they deserve to see as heroes. Stephanie’s clients can be assured that they will always have a strong defender at their side, fighting for the rights they’ve earned as Veterans—and heroes.\n\nWork Hard, Play Harder—Together\n\nWhile Stephanie is a force to be reckoned with in the courtroom, she doesn’t believe in taking herself too seriously. Working hard for her clients also means saving some time to play hard, too. She’s a big lover of books, and enjoys playing video games and board games with her friends and family. She’s also a fan of sports and can often be found watching them on any given evening! Much like her work, Stephanie sees games as challenges to overcome as a team. For her, life is about enjoying the people around you and finding ways to make the world brighter and happier. Stephanie wants to bring that brightness back into the lives of disabled Veterans, which is why she works so tirelessly for them. Through compassion, a joyful spirit, and some real backbone, Stephanie fights for Veterans who needs help battling the VA."
