        "text": "R's\n\nGEORGE H. RAMSAY, president of the Economy Coal Company, which has its general offices in Des Moines and the business of which is of both wholesale and retail order, finds satisfaction in giving his active attention to business affairs, though in December, 1928 he celebrated his eighty-fourth birthday anniversary. Vital and alert in both mental and physical powers, Mr. Ramsay is consistently to be designated as one of the grand old men of the business circles of Iowa's capital city.\n\nMr. Ramsay was born in the County of Durham, England, December 29, 1844, and is a son of William and Ann (Heckels) Ramsay, he being now the only surviving member of a family of nine children. William Ramsay passed his entire life in England, and was forty-five years of age at the time of his death, he having been manager of one of the Durham mines of the Cowen Coal Company. In 1863 Mrs. Ann (Heckels) Ramsay came with her children to the United States and made settlement at Morris, Illinois, the closing years of her life having been passed at Streator, that state, and she having been a devoted member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. William Ramsay, Sr., grandfather of the subject of this review, was born in Scotland and was a farmer in England at the time of his death. The maternal grandfather, William Heckels, passed his entire life in England and was there identified with the coal-mining industry during a long period of years. Thus it may be said that, along both paternal and maternal lines, George H. Ramsay had inherent predilection for the coal business, of which he is now a prominent representative in Iowa. He began work in the coal mines of his native county when he was a lad of ten years, and in the schools of England he gained his youthful education at night school, but his education was somewhat limited. He was eighteen years of age when he accompanied his widowed mother and other members of the family to the United States, and among his early experiences in Illinois was that of assisting in the laying of tracks on the line of railroad between Perkin and Peoria. Thereafter he worked in the coal mines of that state and finally was made mine foreman at Braidwood, Will County. Upon coming to Iowa he became superintendent of coal mines at Albia, and thereafter he was superintendent of the Oskaloosa mines of the Excelsior Coal Company. He finally became independently interested in coal-mining operations in the vicinity of Oskaloosa and Des Moines, and the company of which he is now the president owns and operates mines in the vicinity of Knoxville, Marion County, these mines supplying much of the product used in the wholesale and retail trade of the company. Mr. Ramsay, as previously noted, is president of the Economy Coal Company, and his son John H. is its vice president and manager.\n\nThe political convictions of Mr. Ramsay place him in the ranks of the Republican party, and his religious faith is that of the Nazarene Church, of which his wife likewise was a devoted member. He is affiliated with the Masonic fraternity.\n\nMr. Ramsay is indebted to his own ability and efforts for the success he has achieved, as he became virtually dependent upon his own resources when he was ten years old and found employment in coal mines in his native land. In 1906 he made a month's visit to England, where he enjoyed the surveying of the scenes of his boyhood and the meeting with old family friends, but he states that he was more than glad to come back to the land of his adoption and to his home state. He has made twenty trips to California, but has never faltered in his loyalty to Iowa.\n\nIn the year 1869 Mr. Ramsay was united in marriage to Miss Mary A. Caswell, who was born at Mineral Point, Wisconsin, but reared and educated in Illinois. The devoted companionship of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay continued nearly sixty years, and the gracious bonds were severed by the death of Mrs. Ramsay in June, 1927. Of the twelve children nine survive the loved mother: John H., who celebrated in 1928 his fifty-eight birthday anniversary, is now vice president of the Economy Coal Company, as previously noted. He married Miss Myrtle Phinney, who was born at Iowa Falls, and they have three children: Bertha, John C. and Charles D. Miss Bertha remains at the parental home; John C., who was reared and educated in Des Moines and Oskaloosa, married, in 1919, Miss Lella Stevens, and they have one child, Dorothy May; and Charles D., who received the advantages of the University of Iowa, is now foreman of the mines operated by the Economy Coal Company, five miles east of Des Moines. Ann, second of the surviving children of the subject of this review, is the wife of Frank Ewing, of Des Moines, who is bookkeeper for the mines of the Economy Coal Company, their children being Wilma and John. Clara, next younger daughter, is the wife of John Nowles, who is engaged in mercantile business in Des Moines. Stella is the wife of Dr. George W. Miser, a physician and surgeon engaged in practice in Des Moines. Robert C. is engaged in the machinery business in Oakland, California. Roy resides in Des Moines and is weighmaster at the mines in his father's company, his one child being a son, Roy, Jr. Dora is the wife of Carl Mayer, who is identified with banking enterprise in the City of Oskaloosa. Margaret is the wife of Thomas Beal, and they maintain their home in Des Moines, Mr. Beal being a commercial traveling salesman.\n\nHON. JOHN MCDONALD RAMSEY is an Iowa newspaper man with a continuous record of forty years' association with one paper, the Clarksville Star. These years have been rich in other service to his community and state, especially noteworthy having been the eight years he spent in the Legislature at Des Moines.\n\nMr. Ramsey was born on a farm a mile north of Clarksville in Butler County. February 25, 1870. He is Scotch ancestry and through his mother is classified with that stock known as Scotch-Irish, due to the fact that a family long seated in Scotland moved across the channel to Northern Ireland, whence representatives came to America. Mr. Ramsey is a son of Charles and Margaret Jane (Gabby) Ramsey. His grandfather, Adam Ramsey, came from Edinburgh, Scotland. He was a cabinet maker by trade and was a young man when he sought home and fortune in the new world. Charles Ramsey was born at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1836, and as a young man located at West Union, Ohio, where in 1861 he married Margaret Jane Gabby. Her father, Alexander Gabby, was born in Londonderry, Ireland, was also a cabinet maker, and on coming from Ireland to America settled in Washington County in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Adam Ramsey and Alexander Gabby were both members of the Masonic fraternity and very devout United Presbyterians, maintaining their religious activities strictly according to the rites of that substantial old church. Both served as superintendents of their Sunday School. Charles Ramsey after his marriage tried to get accepted for service in the Union army, but for some reason was rejected. However, he was with the Ohio Home Guard and was called out for active duty at the time of the Morgan raid through the southern part of the state. Morgan made one of his camps on the Gabby farm.\n\nIn 1865 Charles Ramsey brought his family to Iowa, acquiring a tract of land a short distance northeast of Clarksville. Later he moved to the property of M. B. Wamsley, one mile northwest of Clarksville, and two years later he bought a farm four miles southeast of Greene. He had acquired the skill of a cabinet maker from his father and was always an adept with tools and machinery. The furniture and other equipment for his Iowa home were made by his own hands during his hours of leisure. He developed a fine farm and in later years was a representative of the International Harvester Company. He died in 1906, at Sioux City, Iowa. His wife was born in 1840 and died in 1887. Charles Ramsey took an active part in local affairs, serving as trustee, treasurer and clerk of his township and as a school director. He was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows at Greene and voted Democrat, though two of his sons became very staunch Republicans. There were eight children in all, only two of whom are now living. Arthur died in infancy. George passed away in 1878, when a small boy. Ida Ellen died in early girlhood. Agnes Euphemia became the wife of W. W. Moss and died at Osage, Minnesota. William M., a farmer and carpenter, died at Clarksville in 1905. Charles met an accidental death at Sioux City in 1921. The only surviving child besides John M., is Mrs. J. L. Caskey, of Akron, Iowa.\n\nFarm life during the years when John McDonald Ramsey was a boy was not a series of prosperous years. There were crop failures, and with a large household to provide for Charles Ramsey had need to economize and there was little money to provide the children with advantages outside of those of the community church and school. Consequently John M. from early boyhood buckled down to a routine of hard work, and his earnings paid for all his education beyond the limited advantages of the neighborhood school. Part of the time he carried water for a gang of section hands at fifty cents a day. It was more or less of a struggle for him to complete the work of the Greene High School. Borrowing money, he enrolled as a student in the Cedar Rapids Business College. His training there made him a good penman and a capable accountant, and for several years he was employed in the clerical department of the Chicago Great Western and Rock Island Railroads.\n\nHis political career began before he reached his majority, when he was elected township clerk. Following that he was made recorder of Clarksville, for ten years was township assessor and five years township trustee, and for five years was assistant state game warden.\n\nIn 1920 Mr. Ramsey went to the Legislature. He represented Butler County four years in the Lower House and for four years was in the Senate from the district comprising Butler and Bremer counties He proved himself one of the most valuable members of both Houses, being hard working, taking an intelligent attitude toward all public questions and was given important committee assignments, being a member of the judiciary, ways and means, text books, cities and towns, and was chairman of the committee on education. He was in the Legislature during the code session, and he read proof on the revised laws. His legislative experience gave him a wide acquaintance with prominent men all over the state.\n\nHis first lessons in the printing trade were acquired in the office of a Waterloo newspaper. For twenty years he was an employee of Edward Madigan, owner of the Clarksville Star, and in 1909 he bought the paper, so that for fully forty years he has been associated with that live publication. His newspaper files are mines of historic interest for this section of the state. Mr. Ramsey is a master of a forcible newspaper style and his editorials and comments on public questions have been widely quoted in the press of the state. He has for twenty-five years been attending state Republican conventions and twenty-two years of that time has been a delegate. He is a member of the Iowa Press Association and National Editorial Association, is a past chancellor commander of the Knights of Pythias Lodge at Clarksville, and has taken all the degrees of Odd Fellows.\n\nThe record of his life shows that he has been a very busy man, but he has hobbies, one in particular being geology. He has gone about with an observing eye examining the rocks and soils of Iowa, and in collecting specimens illustrating geologic history he has been naturally drawn to the kindred investigations in local archaeology and has gathered up many interesting specimens and curios.\n\nMr. Ramsey married Miss Della Shafer on September 30, 1893, daughter of the late W. W. R. Shafer, who passed away in 1929. Mrs. Ramsey was born in Butler County. They have two daughters, Georgia Edna and Alice Lavon. Georgia is the wife of Gay Jackson, and they have three children: Robert G., Barbara A. and Billy Joe. Both daughters graduated from the local high school and attended the State Teachers College at Cedar Falls, and Alice Lavon is also a graduate of the Ingram School of Expression.\n\nRICHARD ROEMER RAMSELL. Aside from any distinction that may be his because of his connection with two of the foremost pioneer families of Iowa, of that sturdy stock so closely identified with the progress and development of the Hawkeye State, Richard Roemer Ramsell, of Ottumwa, has gained recognition as being one of the leading members of the Iowa bar. During his career he has been associated with some of the most important litigation that has been brought before the state and federal courts, and from 1917 until 1926 was the incumbent of the highly important position of chairman of the committee on appeals and review of the United States Treasury Department at Washington, D. C.\n\nMr. Ramsell was born in Wapello County, Iowa, November 7, 1881, and is a son of William B. and Caroline A. (Roemer) Ramsell. His paternal grandfather, Moses Ramsell, was born at Bangor, Maine, and became an early pioneer of Iowa in the '40s. During the war between the states he served four years as a member of Company C. Seventh Iowa Cavalry, in which he won a sergeant's stripes. Gustavus Adolphus Roemer, the maternal grandfather of Mr. Ramsell, was born in Switzerland, where he married Anna Fritag, and served his term of service in the Swiss army. In 1847 he came to the United States and settled as a pioneer in Wapello County. He was then a man of small means, but possessed his military overcoat, and this he traded for forty acres of land possessed by a former settler. All of this land is now within the city limits of Ottumwa and is the site of the Franklin School. He also secured land from the Government and other land by purchase and became one of the leading and substantial citizens of his community. The old house, greatly remodeled and enlarged, still stands, and is now the home of the fourth generation of the Roemer family in Iowa.\n\nRichard Roemer Ramsell attended Willis Academy at Iowa City, and in 1906 graduated with the degree of Bachelor of laws from the law department of the State University of Iowa. In the same year he was admitted to practice in the state and federal courts, and established himself at Ottumwa, where he soon was recognized as a talented and reliable attorney. From 1917 until 1926, inclusive, he was chairman of the committee on appeals and review of the United States Treasury Department at Washington, D.

Mr. Ramsell is an out-door enthusiast, and in particularly fond of hunting and fishing.\n\nOn September 11, 1912, at Ottumwa, Iowa, Mr. Ramsell was united in marriage with Miss Alma Ethel Glew, who was born at Creston, Iowa, a daughter of Henry G. and Lucy (Hawcock) Glew, of Washington, D. C. natives of England, who came to the United States in 1880 and located in Iowa. Mrs. Ramsell graduated from the Ottumwa High School and for a time taught in the Ottumwas public schools. As a loyal Republican she is actively interested in politics, takes a constructive part in the work of the Presbyterian Church, is a past president of the Parent-Teachers Association, and is active and popular in club circles. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsell are the parents of two sons: Richard Roemer and William Henry, both of whom are attending the Ottumwas High School. The attractive family home is situated at 2223 Roemer Avenue.\n\nVERON C. RAMSEYER, manager of the Ramseyer Hatchery, is one of the aggressive young business men of Oskaloosa, and ne whose public spirit in proverbial. A veteran of the World war, he not only did his duty during the war, he not only did his duty during the war period, but upon his return to civilian life took up the burdens of reconstruction, and has achieved a prosperity that is all the more to his credit, in that he has made his own way in life. He was born at Pulaski, Iowa, August 15, 1894, a son of John H. and Elizabeth (Brenneman) Ramseyer.\n\nThe birth of John H. Ramseyer occurred in Switzerland, and in the early seventies he came to the United States, locating in Davis County, Iowa. The Ramseyer family is a well known one in Iowa, and his brother, Hon. C. W. Ramseyer, is representing the Sixth Congressional District of Iowa in the National Assembly. Mrs. Ramseyer was born in Davis County, Iowa.\n\nGrowing to vigorous young manhood amid healthful surroundings, Vernon C. Ramseyer attended local schools and later Bluffton, Ohio, College, from which he was graduated in 1919 with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He was a student of the law department of the University of Michigan, and also of the University of Chicago. In the meanwhile, however, he gave his country a military service, in 1918 being inducted into the army for the World war, and was a member of Company E, Three Hundred and Fifty-first Infantry, of which he was ranking sergeant. Sent overseas to France, he saw service at the front, and was honorable discharged after his return to the United States at Camp Dodge, Iowa. While in France he was given intensive training in the Officers Training School La Valbonne. Following his discharge in 1919 Mr. Ramseyer went to college and continued his education as already stated.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1922 Mr. Ramseyer was superintendent of Bureau Township schools, Princeton, Illinois, and during 1923 to 1924 he was superintendent of the schools of Pulaski, Iowa. In 1923 he, his father and two brothers, Harry W. and Obern B., the latter of whom has since died, launched the Ramseyer Hatcheries, Incorporated, thus entering the baby chick industry at Pulaski, Iowa.

In 1891 he was one of the organizers of the State Bank of Vinton, becoming a member of the first board of directors, and since the death of Paul Carrell, Mr. Ray has served as president of the bank. Recently the State Bank completed a new banking home, architecturally in keeping with the spirit of the times and also in keeping with forty years of splendid financial service the bank has rendered. This new building was opened for business, July 5, 1930.\n\nMr. Ray is a native of Illinois. He was born in Portland Township, Whiteside County, three miles southwest of Prophetstown, and the time of his birth as subsequently told him by his parents has always been fixed in his memory. It was just four hours before the advent of the new year, on December 31, 1851. His parents were Guy and Louise (Pomeroy) Ray. His father came from Massachusetts and in 1835 made a trip of investigation through Illinois, discovering a tract of land that suited him, and in 1836 he came out to effect a permanent settlement. He became one of the prosperous farmers of Whiteside County, took an active part in local affairs, serving in township offices, and was one of the early voters of the Republican ticket. He was a Presbyterian. Guy Ray died in 1881. By his first marriage he had two daughters, Mrs. Emma R. Sleight, of Moline, Illinois, and Mrs. Camilla Frazelle, of South Charleston, West Virginia. Louise Pomeroy was his second wife. She was born in Ohio.\n\nFrank Guy Ray as a boy on a farm attended the district schools regularly each winter until he was eleven. Then, after a lapse of four years, he resumed his schooling, three winters at Geneseo, Illinois, later as a student at Mount Morris, and his educational opportunities were rounded out with a year in Oberlin College of Ohio. In the meantime he had taught school one term in his old home district.\n\nIt was in 1873 that Mr. Ray came to Vinton, and being impressed by the appearance of prosperity and the character of the people and the opportunities of the outlying trade territory, he decided that this way the place to anchor himself permanently. He found employment in a local implement house, at a monthly salary, but two years later, in 1875, set up in business for himself. He and his partner conducted two implement stores, one at Vinton, and the other at Spencer, Mr. Ray in charge of the Vinton establishment and his partner at Spencer. After a few years they found it to their advantage in dissolve the partnership and each one take over entire responsibility for his local territory. Mr. Ray was in business for over thirty years. The steady enlargement of the volume of his annual sales was a source of great satisfaction to him, and also he found satisfaction in the commercial contacts he made with the farmers not only of the immediate locality, but those at a considerable distance as well. His dealings were such as to inspire confidence, and many of his steadiest customers were the Germans in the neighborhood. As an aid to doing business with them to better advantage he acquired a considerable familiarity with the German language.\n\nMr. Ray finally retired from the implement business, in 1909, and since then has devoted most of his time to banking, and the Portland Cement business and other interests. For a number of years he was a director of the Northwestern Portland Cement Company at Mason City, in which connection he was associated with Charles H. MacNider, father of Hanford MacNider, former national commander of the American Legion, and Mr. Ray counted the senior MacNider as one of his closest friends. About 1914 Mr. Ray became one of the organizers and directors of the Trinity Portland Cement Company, with headquarters at Dallas, Texas, and branch factories at Houston and Fort Worth, and still remains on this board, of which he holds the title of secretary. He is also one of the organizers and now president of the Iowa Canning Company, with headquarters at Vinton and six other branches in Iowa.\n\nMr. Ray is also president of the Virginia Gay Memorial Hospital, which is a credit to the City of Vinton. It was endowed with a gift of $100,000 by Doctor Griffin and a $50,000 gift from Mrs. Virginia Gay.\n\nHe married Miss Emma Whiteside, who came from Pomeroy, Ohio. They were married September 13, 1876, at the bride's parental home. Mrs. Ray has been a life-long member and an active worker in the Presbyterian Church. They have two children. Their son, Earl K., first gained several years' banking experience and then took advantage of an opportunity to become an officer in the Corona Typewriter Company, which at that time was a comparatively new venture, and his ability and energy contributed largely to the success of the Corona Typewriter until it was merged with the L. C. Smith Company. His home is in New York City. He married Miss Mary Latham, of Vinton, and they have one daughter, Emma Janet, who married Leland E. Roseman, of Boston, Massachusetts, and they have one son, Leland Ray Roseman, who is the joy and pride of his great-grandparents. Mrs. Roseman is an accomplished musician. The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ray is Belle, who married Dr. J. M. Knapp, of Boone.\n\nMr. Ray's chief hobby and diversion is Masonry. He is a past master of his lodge, a past eminent commander of the Knights Templar and a member of the Clinton Consistory. The thirty-third, supreme honorary, degree in the Scottish Rite was conferred on him at his home by Ex-Governor B. R. Sherman, who was a member of the Supreme Council of Washington, D. C. In politics Mr. Ray is a Republican.\n\nHe is also known as the father of the Country Club at Vinton. It is a tribute to his youthful spirit that when the younger folks of Vinton need help in carrying through a project they turn to Mr. Ray for counsel. Thus they came to him with their need for a country club, and he devoted a large amount of his time for several years in personally supervising the actual construction of the club and in helping to work out the numerous problems involved, with the results that today Vinton is the recreational center of a considerable area, members coming from many miles around to use the facilities of the club.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Ray will soon celebrate their fifty-fifth wedding anniversary, and it is worthy of note that the contribution they have made to the development of our great State of Iowa and the heritage of honor they are thus able to pass on to their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren is a source of pride and satisfaction to all who know them.\n\nJOHN E. RAY, who is general agent for the Equitable Life Insurance Company of Iowa, with executive headquarters in the City of Waterloo and with office in the Pioneer Building, is a native son of the Hawkeye State and a representative, in the third generation, of one of its sterling pioneer families.\n\nMr. Ray was born on the parental home farm three miles southeast of Shellsburg, Benton County, Iowa, on the 4th of January, 1872, and is a son of John H. Ray, Jr., who was born in New York City, he having been a son of John H. Ray, who was born in Sweden and who became an orphan when he was but a child. He was a lad of nine years when he initiated his seafaring career, and he continued a sailor on ocean ships during a period of twenty years and having voyaged far and wide. After retiring from the sea he maintained a Sailor's Home in New York City for a time and then removed to Indiana, from which state he came with his family to Iowa and became a pioneer settler in Linn County. There he owned and developed a productive farm, and he passed the closing period of his life in the village of Palo, that county, where he died November 13, 1902, at the venerable age of eighty-one years. He was a man of strong mentality, was well fortified in his political convictions and was an ardent supporter of the cause of the Republican party, as a representative of which he voted for Abraham Lincoln for the presidency of the United States. He was long and actively affiliated with the Masonic fraternity and received in the same the thirty-second degree of Scottish Rite. His wife, who was of German ancestry, preceded him to the life eternal.\n\nJohn H. Ray, Jr., father of the subject of this review, was a boy at the time of the family removal to Linn County, Iowa, where he was reared on the pioneer farm and received the advantages of the public schools of the period. His youth was one of industry, as he early began to assist in the work of the home farm, and he started his independent career as a farmer by renting land from his father. He thus continued his operations three years and then, in 1874, removed to Sioux County, where he entered claim to a homestead of eighty acres. Like many of the other pioneers, he went through the three year grasshopper scourge soon after his arrival. He reclaimed this land to cultivation, erected good buildings and made other improvements, and there the family home was maintained until 1884, when removal was made to Hull, that county, in order to give the children the advantages of the public schools of the village. He continued to supervise the affairs of his old home farm and also of a farm adjoining Hull. There he remained until 1894, when he removed to Riceville, Iowa, where he died April 5, 1896, at the age of forty-seven years. His wife, whose maiden name was Lucinda Miller, survived him many years and was within a week of eighty-three years of age at the time of her death, October, 3, 1928. She was born in Ohio and was a daughter of Paul and Catherine Miller, who were residents of Iowa at the time of their death. John H. and Lucinda (Miller) Ray became the parents of four children: Paul M., vice president and superintendent of agents of the Provident Life Insurance Company at Chattanooga, Tennessee; John E.; Daniel G., manager of the Farmers Cooperative Association at McGregor, Iowa; and Martha Gertrude, who lives at Blackwell, Oklahoma.\n\nJohn E. Ray supplemented the discipline of the rural district school by attending the public school at Hull, including the high school. That he profited by the advantages thus afforded him is shown by the success that attended his service as a teacher in the public schools, he having been principal of schools at different places and after continuing his pedagogic service several years he was a traveling salesman twenty years, during the period of 1898-1918. In the latter year he assumed his present position of general agent for the Equitable Life Insurance Company of Iowa, and he has marked the passing years with successful administration in this position. His political support is given to the Republican party and he takes loyal interest in all that concerns the welfare of his home city and native state.\n\nIn the year 1892 Mr. Ray was united in marriage to Miss Etta M. Sanborn, who was born at Columbus, Wisconsin, a daughter of George E. and Mary (Tompkins) Sanborn, representatives of families that came from England to America in an early period of the nation's history.

Gilda, a bank cashier at Grimes, Iowa; Mary E. married Frederick Thorne, inspector for the Viking Pump Company at Cedar Falls, Iowa, and they have one son, Ray F., born September 22, 1924; John H. III is a soloist and choir director and music teacher; and Paul E. is traveling in several Southern States for the Florsheim Shoe Company.\n\nTHOMAS JOHN REEVES, clerk of the District Court at Orange City, has spent a long and active life in Northwestern Iowa, and enjoys a place of special regard in Sioux County, the people of which have chosen him five successive times to his present office.\n\nMr. Reeves was born at Kaneville in Kane County, Illinois, December 5, 1856, a son of Stephen and Abigail (Snell) Reeves, his father a native of England and his mother of New York State. Thomas John Reeves was twelve years old when his parents moved to Iowa, in 1868. He had attended Illinois schools and finished his education after coming to Iowa.\n\nWhen he was about sixteen years of age he went to work as clerk in a drug store, studied pharmacy largely by practical experience, and in 1878 was registered as a pharmacist. In the same year he opened a business of his own at Seney, Iowa, and was the local druggist of that community for ten years. He was also appointed postmaster in 1878, and held this office all the ten years he was in the general mercantile and drug business there. On selling his interest at Seney Mr. Reeves moved, in 1888, to Earlville, Iowa, where he was in the drug business one year, in 1888 located at Racine, Wisconsin, and soon afterward took up a Government homestead in Northwestern Nebraska, but in 1891 returned to Iowa and settled on a farm at Westfield. In the spring of 1892 he bought a farm in South Dakota and was a part of the rural community and the agricultural life of the state for thirteen years.\n\nOn returning to Iowa Mr. Reeves settled at Hawarden in Sioux County, and in 1904 he and his nephew, S. W. Harker, engaged in the drug business. Their partnership continued for ten years, and when Mr. Reeves sold out, in November, 1914, he retired from business except for the supervision of his private interests and has had time to devote to the duties of public office. Mr. Harker still continues in business, with G. F. Burket.\n\nMr. Reeves was city clerk of Hawarden from 1907 to 1923. On January 1, 1923, he took up his duties as clerk of the District Court at Orange City and is now serving in his fifth term.

Kubicek, of Tama, Iowa, now an electrician at Orange City.\n\nO. N. REFSELL, attorney and banker of Emmet County, is a resident of Esterville and descended from one of the sturdy early Norwegian families in this section of Iowa.\n\nHis grandparents, Ole and Mary (Paulson) Refsell came from Norway shortly after the close of the Civil war, and arrived in Emmet County just in time to secure the last tract of land still available from the public lands owned by the Government. This land had been filed on, but the first claimant had not completed the necessary improvements and it was a relinquishment when the Refsells secured it. Ole Refsell adapted himself to the circumstances of a new country, made a good record as an industrious farmer, and he and his wife enjoyed the respect and esteem of a large circle of acquaintances in Emmet County. He died March 2, 1895, and his wife in October, 1900. They were Lutherans in Iowa, as they had been in Norway. Their four children were: O. O., of Emmet County; Peter O., who died on Easter Sunday, April 20, 1930; James; and I.

He was sixty-six years old when he died, April 19, 1926, and no citizen of Emmet County left behind him a record showing more enterprise in a business way, and more hearty public spirit and generosity in his relationships as a citizen and community builder. He grew up in Emmet County, had the advantages of the common schools, and for a number of years devoted all his personal attention to his farming. When he left the farm, in 1915, he moved to the Village of Wallingford in Emmet County, where he helped organize and became the first president of the Farmers Savings Bank. He was president of the bank when he died, and also president of the Farmers Elevator Company, was a director in the creamery company and telephone company. When he moved to town he did not dispose of his farming property and at his death he owned one farm of 280 acres, another of 188 acres and also the twenty acres in the home place at Wallingford. His bank was the only one in that section of Iowa which did not close during the epidemic of bank failures. The integrity of the bank was in keeping with the integrity of its president. Mrs. James Refsell lives at Wallingford and the only daughter, Miss Emma, is also a member of the household there. James Refsell married, in 1886, Annie Osher. She was born in Dane County, Wisconsin, daughter of Neis and Ingeborg (Nordheim) Osher. Her parents came from Norway and settled in Wisconsin in 1850 and in 1870 moved to Emmet County, Iowa.\n\nO. N.

RICHARDS, M. D. The medical profession of Fremont County numbered among its members no more capable or learned physician and surgeon than Dr. Emmett E. Richards, who had been engaged in practice at Hamburg for more than two decades, and died August 10, 1929. During the time he spent in practice at Hamburg he not only built up a reputation for splendid talent along professional lines, but also as a citizen of public spirit, who accepted and discharged official responsibilities in a highly capable and commendable manner.\n\nDoctor Richards was born on a farm in Atchison County, Missouri, December 11, 1870, and was a son of John and Elizabeth (Hayes) Richards. John Richards was born in Ohio, where he secured an excellent education for his day, and became a pioneer of Missouri in 1856, arriving in that state with only seventy-five cents in cash. He soon found employment as a teacher in the primitive rural schools, and was thus engaged for several years, then turned his attention to farming. During the war between the states he espoused the cause of the Union and served as a member of the Home Guard, and at the close of the struggle laid down the arms of war to take up again the implements of peace. For many years he was leading agriculturist of Atchison County, where he developed a highly cultivated farm and raised grain and cattle, at his death leaving an estate of about 100,000, including the old home place, which is owned by four of his children. Mr. Richards was not only prominent as an agriculturist, but as a man who was active and capable in public affairs. For nearly a quarter of a century he was president of the local board of supervisors, and in addition served as chairman of the Democratic county committee for a long term.

In March, 1909, he took up his residence at Hamburg, Iowa, where he built up an extensive and remunerative practice. Doctor Richards won a substantial position in his profession through hard work, close application and steady development of accumulative knowledge and talent. He was a close student of his profession, and his offices contained a large and comprehensive medical library and all of the implements known to modern medical and surgical science. He was a specialist in no one line, as he was familiar with all departments of his science, and was a member of the Fremont Medical Society, the Iowa State Medical Society and the American Medical Association. A Democrat in politics, he bore his full share of the duties of citizenship, and served as mayor of Hamburg for three terms and as a member of the school board for twelve years. He was always interested in farming, and was the owner of a valuable and highly-improved property located in Union County, Iowa.

One Hundred and Tenth Field Artillery, and later in the Aviation Service and is now in the life insurance business at Rock Rapids. He married in 1921 Miss Doris Kline, of Saint Paul, and they have two boys, James and Frederick.\n\nROBERT L. ROACH, head of Roach Investment Company, is one of the active and prominent younger business men of Muscatine, which is his native city and the Iowa locality with which the Roach family have been identified for three generations.\n\nMr. Roach is a son of William LeRoy and Margaret (McCarthy) Roach and was born at Muscatine February 27, 1894. More extended reference is made to his father in the preceding sketch. His father died December 18, 1916 and his mother in 1909.\n\nRobert L. Roach attended parochial schools, for three years was a student in St. Mary's College in Kansas, and completed a four years' liberal education in Notre Dame University of Indiana in 1915, being president of the senior class in that year. Throughout the years since he left college he has been interested in the lumber business. In 1916 he went to Live Oak, Florida, to enter the employ of the Standard Lumber Company and in 1917 was elected secretary. On returning to Muscatine in 1922 Mr. Roach became associated with the Roach & Musser Sash & Door Company and the Roach Timber Company. He is still secretary of the Roach Timber Company and director of the Roach & Musser Sash & Door Company. However, since 1927 he has given most of his time to the investment business as head of the Roach Investment Company, with offices in the Laurel Building. Mr. Roach is a very popular member of the business and social community of Muscatine. For one year he was president of the Lions Club, and for three years was president of the Geneva Golf and Country Club and is a member of the Knights of Columbus and St. Mathias Catholic Church. He has been chairman of the finance committee of the Muscatine Welfare Association for the past three years and chairman of the joint committee of the Muscatine Service Club for the past two years.\n\nHe married, December 27, 1915, Miss Julia S. Schneider, of Iowa City, daughter of A. J. and Mary (Hanley) Schneider. Her father is a member of Schneider Brothers, furniture dealers and undertakers of Iowa City. Mr. and Mrs. Roach have one son, William LeRoy, born in 1922.\n\nWILLIAM LEROY ROACH. Many of the important facts of Muscatine's industrial and commercial history revolve around the name Roach. The Roach family has been in Muscatine since 1862.\n\nThe founder of the family there was William Martin Roach, who was born in Canada, his father being a Canadian, of Irish descent, and hi smother of French parentage. William Martin Roach was born in Canada, learned the trade of tanner and furrier, and on moving to Muscatine, in 1862, engaged in the boot and shoe and wholesale leather business with Andrew Davidson, his father-in-law. Later he became connected with the hide and fur business, and was an active figure in Muscatine's commercial circles until his death in 1898, at the age of seventy-seven. William Martin Roach married Sarah Mary Davidson, whose father, Andrew Davidson, came to Iowa from Ohio. Her mother was Elizabeth (Meek) Davidson. William Martin Roach reared a family of six children, Elizabeth D., William LeRoy, Lillian M., Ada, Ellen V. and Grace E.\n\nWilliam LeRoy Roach, of the second generation of the family at Muscatine, became conspicuous in the lumber industry, one of the men who made Muscatine of the leading centers of lumber manufacture in the Middle West. He was born at Muscatine, October 10, 1862, was educated in grade and high schools in his native city, and form an early age established his habits at thrift and industry by working on holidays and in vacations. When he was eighteen years old he was bookkeeper and clerk for the Davidson & Roach Boot & Shoe Store. After two and a half years he became bookkeeper for M. S. Ritchey, with whom he remained two years. Out of his earnings he saved $600 which he gave to his father, and then started to accumulate for himself, working steadily until he had an initial capital of $1000. It was in June, 1881, that he left Muscatine and became bookkeeper and clerk for the Muscatine Coal Company at What Cheer in Keokuk County, but the real opening of the doors of opportunity began in January, 1883, when he went to work for the Huttig Sash & Door Company at Kansas City. After he had accumulated $1000 he invested in stock in the Huttig Company. In 1885 he established the Roach & Wilker Manufacturing Company, manufacturing sash, doors and mill work, at Kansas City. Still later he concentrated his interests in the Western Sash & Door Company. He was also a stockholder in and was made vice president of the Huttig Sash & Door Company of St. Louis. Selling out his interests in these two organizations, in June, 1888, he organized the Roach & River Manufacturing Company of Kansas City.\n\nMr. Roach in June, 1889, returning to Muscatine, organized the Muscatine Sash & Door Company, and for several years shipped finished products all over the United States from the plants at Muscatine and Kansas City. Later he concentrated his interests in Muscatine, in the industry known as the Roach & Musser Sash & Door Company, of which he was president and general manager until his death on December 18, 1916. This business at that time was one of the largest of its kind in the United States and was instrumental in bringing a large share of substantial prosperity to the city. Mr. Roach also had large holdings in timber lands in different parts of the country. He is recalled as a man of not only superior business judgment but always generous in the spirit of helpfulness to his fellow men and public spirited wherever any cause for general benefit was concerned.\n\nHe married, February 21, 1887, Miss Margaret E. McCarthy, of Kansas City, daughter of Michael McCarthy. She died in 1909, leaving four children: John William, James, Edward Andrew and Robert Leonard.\n\nPHILIP F. ROAN, an Iowa attorney practicing law at Fort Madison, grew up in that town, was a salesman and business man until after the World war, in which he saw service overseas, and has made an excellent record in his profession.\n\nHe was born at Marceline, Missouri, December 9, 1892, son of Peter F. and Mary (Fagan) Roan, both of whom were born in Iowa, his mother at Burlington. The parents live in Fort Madison. His father has spent all his active life as a railroad man, an engineer with the Santa Fe Company, and was living t Marceline on that road when his son Philip F. was born. The other children are: Leo, of Fort Worth, Texas; Mrs. Cecilia Riley, of Marceline; Mrs. Rosana Freesmeier, of Detroit, Michigan; Miss Margaret, of Fort Madison; and Peter F. Jr., of Ontario.\n\nPhilip F. Roan grew up at Fort Madison, and attended public schools there, graduating from high school in 1914. For two years he was a salesman for the Moon Motor Car Company at Saint Louis, and during 1916 was a timekeeper for the Sante Fe Railway Company.\n\nMr. Roan in December, 1916, enlisted with an ambulance corps for service in the French army, had training at Fountainpieau, near Paris, and was in active service eight months, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. After being released from this service he returned to America and joined the Tank Corps, being trained at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, with Company A of the Three Hundred Second Battalion, with the rank of sergeant. He again went overseas, was stationed at Langres, and for six months after the armistice was in Germany.\n\nAfter his honorable discharge in September, 1919, entered the Detroit College of Law, which he attended three years, getting his LL. B. degree in 1924. During the summer vacations he carried on his studies at the University of Michigan, and after graduating he spent a year in the University of Detroit, where he won his Master's degree in 1925. For one year he was connected with the legal department of the Michigan Bell Telephone Company, and in 1927 returned to Fort Madison to engage in a general law practice, and has accumulated a very promising business in his profession.\n\nHe is a member of the Sigma Nu Phi fraternity, the B. P. O. Elks, and was active on the school debating teams the three years he was in law college. He has served several years as chairman of the Lee County central Republican committee.\n\nMr. Roan married, June 23, 1923, Miss Elinor Smith, of Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nCHARLES BURTON ROBBINS is a native of Iowa who has packed into a life of a little more than fifty years a heaping measure of experience, service and achievements, representing not only an exceedingly busy but a most useful career.\n\nHe was born on a farm near Hastings in Mills County, Iowa, November 6, 1877, son of Lewis and Harriett E. (Benson) Robbins. The earlier generations of the Robbins family were found in New England, and members of the family were soldiers in the Revolutionary war. His grandfather, Joseph Robbins, was a miller at Nelsonville, Ohio, and Lewis Robbins also followed that occupation in Ohio until his marriage with Harriett E. Benson. She was born at Buffalo, New York, but before her marriage had taught school in Nelsonville. Her father, James Benson, was a native of England.\n\nOn coming out to Iowa Lewis Robbins took up a homestead in Mills County, and made a good farm out of it. He remained in Mills County until March, 1893, when he moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, and died in that city in October, 1893. The mother passed away in May, 1896.\n\nCharles Burton Robbins spent his early years on an Iowa farm, attended country schools in Mills County, was a student in a private school at Hempstead on Long Island, and in 1898 took his A. B. degree at the University of Nebraska. Shortly before graduating from that school America declared war on Spain, and on April 27, 1898, he enlisted as a private in Company B, First Nebraska Infantry. On May 10, 1898, he was promoted to first sergeant, and on June 17th left San Francisco for the Philippines. The regiment participated in the battle of Manila on August 13, 1898, and was engaged in duty during the Philippine insurrection from its outbreak until June 18, 1899. All told, the regiment participated in twenty-eight battles, more than any other regiment in the Philippines. Colonel Robbins was cited for gallantry on February 5, 1899, and was wounded in the head at the battle of Marilao, March 27, 1899. He was commissioned a second lieutenant April 24, 1899, in Company I of the First Nebraska Infantry. He accompanied the regiment in June, 1899, and the regiment was formally disbanded in August of that year. After leaving the army Colonel Robbins did some post-graduate work in the University of Nebraska and in April, 1900, started on a trip around the world, revisiting the Philippines, and at the close of the trip entered Columbia University at New York, where he won his Master of Arts degree in June, 1903. While in New York he was a member of Company C, Seventh Regiment, New York National Guard, from 1901 to 1903.\n\nHe studied law while in Columbia and after returning to Iowa entered the law offices of Grimm, Trewin & Moffitt, at Cedar Rapids. He was admitted to the bar in October, 1904, and then became junior partner of Grimm, Trewin & Robbins. His time and abilities were taken up by private practice until July 16, 1909, when Governor Carroll appointed him judge of the Superior Court, and he was on the bench until 1919. His service on the bench was distinguished by something more than the able conduct of the routine of office. It was he who instituted juvenile court work at Cedar Rapids, and he was in large measure responsible for getting through the Legislature the contributing dependency act, the Perkins law and widow's pension act, all important pieces of legislation in Iowa social welfare.\n\nJudge Robbins for many years has been known as an authority on insurance law, and since 1905 has been associated with the Cedar Rapids Life Insurance Company, being general counsel and chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors until 1914, and since that year president and general counsel of the company. He is also a director of the Cedar Rapids National Bank and the Cedar Rapids Candy Company.\n\nHis military record did not close with his service in the Philippines. He was captain of Company D of the First Infantry of the Iowa National Guard from 1914 to 1916. On November 2, 1916, he was commissioned major in the adjutant general's department of Iowa, while on duty on the Mexican border. From August, 1917, until May, 1919, he was major and adjutant of the Sixty-seventh and later the Sixty-ninth Infantry Brigade, with the United States Army, and was with the American Expeditionary Forces during 1918-19. In 1921 he was commissioned a major in the United States Reserves, lieutenant-colonel in 1923, and colonel in 1926, and is now colonel and commanding officer of the Three Hundred Forty-ninth Infantry. Colonel Robbins was chosen commander of the Iowa Department of the American Legion in 1922, and in 1924 was civilian aide to the secretary of war for the Citizens Military Training Camps.\n\nIn 1928 he was called to Washington as an assistant secretary of war, and served in that capacity until March 5, 1929. When he left his post in Washington, after a year of service, the department employees voted him the most popular man who had ever held an assistant secretaryship, and subsequently the seven major general in charge of the Army Supply Department presented him with an American flag in appreciation of his work. In commenting on this signal recognition of one of Cedar Rapids' citizens, a local newspaper editorially said: \"In other ways Colonel Robbins achieved a remarkable record during his short term of service in Washington. Hanford MacNider had set an enviable record, but Colonel Robbins kept well abreast of it. He could see no reason why the Government should be victimized just because it is supported by taxpayers. On one occasion the department was to sell one and a quarter million uniforms. The assistant secretary discovered that all of the bidders had gotten together on their bids. The plan was to split the profits. The uniforms were promptly withdrawn from sale and later were disposed of at an increase of several hundreds of thousands of dollars above the former high bid.\n\n\"Col. Robbins' skillful maneuvering also is responsible for the appropriation of $250,000 annually for three years to furnish tanks for the army, and mechanize it in other ways. His own experience in war taught him the importance of tanks and motor trucks. Doubtless his keen appreciation of army needs contributed to the high esteem in which he is held by the generals. He brought to his post a rare combination of business ability and first-hand knowledge of military affairs. Add to this his knack of making friends and getting things done and you have the secret to his brilliant record as assistant secretary of war.\"\n\nLike many other very busy men Colonel Robbins has a hobby. He is collecting old coins. He is a Republican in politics, a member of the Universalist Church, a member of the Iowa State Bar Association, Iowa Historical Society, Delta Tau Delta fraternity, and is a thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason, also belongs to the York Rite bodies, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and is past exalted ruler of the B. P. O. Elks. He is a member of the Sojourners Club of Washington and was twice president of the Cedar Rapids Commercial Club. While with the organization he was chairman of the committee that started the movement, later became chairman of the election committee, for the bond issue to provide for the Memorial Building. The result is the million dollar building that is one of the finest war memorials in the country, serving a great utilitarian purpose as a community center of Cedar Rapids, being used as city hall, Chamber of Commerce quarters, armory for the National Guard, club rooms for the Grand Army of the Republic and Spanish War Veterans, and also as a civic auditorium. Colonel Robbins is president of the American Life Convention.\n\nHe married, September 19, 1903, Miss Helen Larrabee of Clermont, Iowa, who died August 9, 1919. Her father, the late William Larrabee was the distinguished Iowan, educator, author, manufacturer, farmer and banker, member of the State Senate, and with a career culminating as the twelfth governor of Iowa. He was also the first president of the Iowa state board of control. Colonel Robbins has two daughters, Anna Marcella and Julia Larrabee, both at home, and one son, Lewis Frederic, a student in the State University of Iowa.\n\n~~~~~\n\nMANFORD A. ROBINSON, Doctor of Dental Surgery, has for many years occupied an honored place in his profession and in the citizenship of Maquoketa. He is a native of Iowa, and his people were pioneers in Clinton County.\n\nDoctor Robinson was born in Clinton County, Iowa, August 3, 1868, son of James M. and Cynthia (Ross) Robinson. His parents came from Indiana, his father settling in Clinton County in 1852. In 1854 he bought forty acres in Welton Township, later added 300 acres by purchase, and was one of the well-to-do and prosperous farmers of that locality. He has lived a long and useful life, passing away in February, 1917, at the age of ninety-four. His wife died in 1907, when eighty-three. Seven children were born to their marriage: Eliza, who became the wife of Lorenzo Hastings; Sarah, who married J. W. Knight; James W., deceased; John Q., a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church; Frank S., deceased; Olive, who died in infancy; and Manford A.\n\nDr. Manford A. Robinson was reared on a farm, attended the district schools of Clinton County and attended Cornell College at Mount Vernon, Iowa. In 1891 he was graduated from the dental department of the University of Iowa. Doctor Robinson has kept in touch with the great advance made in the methods and technique of dental surgery during the forty years since he was in dental school. He completed a special course in the University of Iowa, later had other special training and attended a special clinic with the Mayo Brothers Hospital at Rochester, Minnesota. Doctor Robinson after graduating, in 1891, practiced for five years at Dewitt, Iowa. In April, 1896, he established his home and office at Maquoketa, where he has enjoyed general recognition of his talents and skill. Doctor Robinson is a Republican in politics, is a Knight Templar Mason and a member of the Congregational Church.\n\nHe married, September 10, 1890, Miss Emma C. Everhart, daughter of Miller A. and Emma (Clark) Everhart. Both parents are now deceased. Her father was a veteran railroad man, being in the service fifty-two years, and for forty-five years was with the bridge department of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul System, at first at Wheatland and later at Oxford Junction, Iowa. Doctor and Mrs. Robinson have a family of six children: Manford E., a farmer in Jackson County; Millard M., a merchant at Hurstville; James E., a Maquoketa pharmacist; John Q., associated with his brother in business at Hurstville; Lucile, now the wife of O. H. Cuddy, cashier of the First National Bank of Maquoketa; and Ruth, the wife of Russell D. Baker, sales manager of the Redwood Lumber Company of San Francisco, California.\n\nMARIA M. ROBERTS, dean of Iowa State College at Ames, has distinguished herself by rare gifts as an administrator and educator. She is also a scientist, and it was her attainments as a mathematical scholar that brought her to the Iowa State College faculty.\n\nMiss Roberts is a native of Ohio, born at Dunlap, and represents a family of culture that left its impress on the early traditions of the state. She is a daughter of Benjamin F. Roberts, who came from Connecticut to Iowa in 1857, traveling by train as far as Iowa City and then walked, guiding the ox teams that hauled wagons containing household goods, women and children. He and seven brothers settled on adjacent farms in Harrison County, Iowa. He was engaged in farming there until 1908, when he removed to Ames and spent his last years in the college community, where he died in 1921. He was a Union soldier; in Company C of the Twenty-ninth Iowa Infantry. It was shortly after his discharge at the close of the war that he married Ellen Rogers, who had come to Iowa from Michigan in 1860. She was one of the early school teachers of Harrison County. The father and mother of Benjamin F. Roberts established in Harrison County in 1861 the Farmers Wives Society, which was probably the first woman's club in the state. Dean Roberts has one brother, O. W. Roberts, who was born in Harrison County, attended high school at Dunlap, and graduated from Iowa State College, and is now head of the weather bureau at Bismarck, North Dakota.\n\nMaria M. Roberts attended the common and high schools of Dunlap, Iowa, graduated from high school in 1884, and in 1890 took the Bachelor of Science degree from Iowa State College at Ames. The following year she taught at Des Moines and in 1891 returned to Ames as an instructor in mathematics in the State College. Besides her many years of work as teacher of mathematics Dean Roberts is known among mathematicians for her contributions as joint author with Julia T. Colbert on the text book on Analytic Geometry, published in 1918 by John Wiley & Son, and now used as a text book by many of the leading institutions of the country, including the state universities of Iowa, Wisconsin and Nebraska. Miss Roberts is a member of the American Mathematical Society and Mathematical Association of America.\n\nHer special gifts in work of administration caused Miss Roberts a number of years ago to be appointed vice dean, and on the death of Dean Stanton, in 1920, she was made acting dean, and a year later was given her present title as dean of Junior College at Iowa State College. She now has fifteen faculty assistants besides several secretaries and stenographers, and has full charge of all the scholastic work of the freshman and sophomore years, with a more or less general supervision of the activities of 2,500 students. Dean Roberts has done graduate work in Columbia, Cornell and Chicago universities, and is a member of many learned and civic organizations. She is a member of Chapter 99 of P. E. O., also of Pi Beta Phi Sorority and a member of the Congregational Church.\n\nORRIN ROBERTSON, originator and founder of the Vita-O-Pathic Non-Surgical Sanitarium of Clariton, who enjoys a large following of patients and friends, is a man of intellectual gifts, and life long habits of study have brought him in contact with the deepest sources of philosophy, religion and the science of medicine. He was born in Cass County, Missouri, May 28, 1858, son of Jefferson and Martha Robertson. Doctor Robertson has received thirty-one diplomas from various institutions of learning both in America and in Europe. He holds degrees in law and medicine from the University of Iowa. He studied and qualified for the ministry and spent two years in missionary work in old Mexico. For four years he was an instructor in the New York College of Megnetics, holds a diploma in osteopathy, is a fellow of the Eastern Section of Theosophy, is a Doctor of Spiritual Science, Doctor of Philosophy, and in the ministry was identified with the Chirothesian Church of Faith at Los Angeles. He is a member of the Society of Oriental Mystics.\n\nFor some years he was on the lecture platform, devoting most of his attention to topics along new thought lines. He has conducted several sanitaria similar to the one he established at Chariton. He has written extensively on medical and health subjects, and in his practice has held to the central ideas expressed in the slogan \"Eat right - Breathe right - Think right.\"\n\nABRAHAM H. ROGERS, who is living retired in the City of Oskaloosa, judicial center of Mahaska County, was born and reared in this county, is a representative of one of its very early pioneer families, and here he so ordered his course during his many years of identification with farm industry as to gain the substantial success and prosperity that enable him to pass the gracious evening of his life in well earned retirement and under conditions that are in every way benignant. The family name has been honorably and prominently linked with the annals of Iowa history during a period of more than eighty years.\n\nAbraham H. Rodgers was born on the pioneer home farm of his parents in Spring Creek Township, Mahaska County, October 11, 1846, and is a son of Daniel and Sarah E. (Comstock) Rodgers, who here reclaimed from the virgin prairie the productive farm that was their place of abode until their death, they having contributed their quota to civic and industrial progress in Mahaska County and their names merit enduring place on the roster of the honored pioneers of the Hawkeye State.\n\nAbraham H. Rodgers was reared to the sturdy discipline of the pioneer farm, and in the meanwhile profited by the advantages of the common schools of the locality and period. It is interesting to record that in the rural school he attended in his youth his two sons later prosecuted their studies under the preceptorship of the same teacher who had there been the instructor of their father many years previously.\n\nMr. Rodgers was a lad of about fifteen years at the inception of the Civil war, and before its close he was able to give expression to his youthful patriotism by enlisting for service in defense of the nation's integrity. In 1864 he enlisted as a member of Company I, Forty-seventh Iowa Volunteer Infantry, and with this command he continued in active service until the close of the war, he having been with his regiment in Arkansas when he received his honorable discharge in the early summer of 1865. He has ever retained deep interest in his old comrades, whose ranks grow less day by day and year by year, and has signalized this by his appreciative affiliation with Phil Kearney Post No. 40, Grand Army of the Republic, at Oskaloosa, where also he maintains affiliation with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.\n\nAfter the close of his military career Mr. Rodgers resumed his active association with farm industry in his native county. He became the owner of a fine farm estate of 200 acres five miles northeast of Oskaloosa, and there he staged his activities as a progressive representative of general farm enterprise until he retired and established his home in the City of Oskaloosa, where he owns and occupies an attractive residence at 328 North D Street, he still retaining possession of his farm property. The political allegiance of Mr. Rodgers is given to the Republican party, and he has ever been loyal and public-spirited in his civic attitude. While on the farm he served as a member of the school board of his district and also held various township offices. He and his wife are zealous members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, as was also his first wife.\n\nIn 1874 was solemnized the marriage of Mr. Rodgers and Miss Mary Josephine Millice, of Warsaw, Indiana, and at their home in Oskaloosa her death occurred January 31, 1922, after their companionship had covered a period of nearly half a century. Of the children of this union the eldest is Deuward, who is one of the representative farmers of Mahaska County, the maiden name of his wife having been Maude Glasscock and their children being Bernice, Blance and Floyd. Harry Wilkins Rodgers, the second son, is likewise a progressive farmer in his native county. He married Miss Annis Buckner, and they have three daughters, Beulah, Wilmer and Lorena, the eldest daughter, Miss Beulah, having won in 1928 the Iowa State prize in canning and this having gained to her a free trip to Europe, James D., youngest of the sons and a successful farmer in Mahaska County, married Miss Lena Melchur, and their three children are sons, Harry, Roy and James D., Jr. As loyal and progressive citizens all three sons are well upholding the honors of the family name and are representatives of the third generation of the family in Mahaska County.\n\nThe second marriage of Mr. Rodgers occurred June 7, 1923, when he wedded Mrs. Mary (Roenspiess) Moore, widow of J. C. Moore, she having had by her first marriage one son, Leo Moore, who is deceased and whose widow, Mrs. Mary (Griffin) Moore, and their one child, Leo, Jr., reside in the City of Fort Dodge. Mrs. Rodgers is the popular chatelaine of the attractive home in Oskaloosa.\n\nTHOMAS J. ROGERS, a retired citizen of Moulton, has lived a long and interesting career. One fact that makes him distinguished among the present generation is that he is a surviving veteran of the Union army of the Civil war. His home has been in Appanoose County for over three-quarters of a century.\n\nHe was nine years of age when his parents moved to Appanoose County in 1850. Mr. Rogers was born in Pike County, Illinois, September 26, 1841, son of Thomas J. and Phoebe (Shinn) Rogers. Thomas J. Rogers, Sr., who was born in North Carolina, in 1810 moved across the Mississippi River and bought land in Appanoose County in 1850. He was for a number of years a merchant, and helped organize one of the first Methodist churches in Appanoose County. His wife, Phoebe Shinn, was born in Ohio, in 1817.\n\nThomas J. Rogers grew up on an Iowa farm, had the advantages of the schools of that day, which were still of a pioneer character, and in 1861, when he was twenty years of age, he went across the state line and enlisted in Company H. of the Second Missouri Cavalry. He ranked as a master sergeant. His regiment was employed in general scouting duty over Northern Missouri and he participated in the fight at Kirksville and in several other engagements. He received his honorable discharge at Saint Louis in 1865 and soon returned to Appanoose County. Mr. Rogers' business career was devoted to farming and stock raising. For over sixty years, a record for continuous service seldom equaled, he was engaged in farming and the raising of blooded sheep and cattle. Since 1919 he has had his home in the town of Moulton. All who know him respect him for his integrity of character and his worth and standing as a citizen. He has for many years been a member of W. A. Clarke Post No. 434 of the the Republic and has been on the pension rolls of the Government for his army service. His family are active in the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nMr. Rogers married, in June, 1865, Sarah M. Willet. She lived only a few months after her marriage. In 1869 Mr. Rogers married Lovena Miller, who was born in Unionville, Iowa, and as a young woman taught school in that state. She passed away October 19, 1929, after they had been married for sixty years. Twelve children were born to them, and ten of them are still living. There are also forty-five grandchildren and forty-eight great-grandchildren. The oldest of the children is Mrs. Clementine Ransom, and her four children are Lou, Thomas, Velta, and Roland. The son James G., now deceased, left five children, Garret A., Thomas A., Vera, Grace and Esther. Mrs. Ann Blosser, who lives at Moulton, has two children, Roger and Claudia. Mrs. Martha Murdy, of Albia, Iowa, is the mother of seven children, Lester, Theodore, Louemma, Mildred, Ellen, Wendle and Enid. Mrs. Alda Richardson, whose home is at Saint Cloud, Florida, also has seven children, Thane, Charles, Eva, Victor, Lou, Theodore and Alda. Mrs. Laura Cox, of Orlando, Florida, has seven children, named Rolla, Hobart, Madaline, Geneva, Justice, Wilma and Carlos. Frank M., who occupies the old farm homestead in Appanoose County, is the father of five children, Thomas, Georgia and Virginia, twins, Hazel and James. Mrs. Mina Swartz, who lives at Moulton, has three children, Mary Elizabeth, William F. and Margaret. Georgia and Virginia are twin daughters. Georgia is the wife of Dr. Earl Frank, of Shelbyville, Tennessee, and their children are Stuart and Rogers M. Virginia married Earl French and lives at Alhambra, California, her two children being William and Robert. Chester Rogers, the youngest of the family, lives at Ontario, Canada, and has a daughter, Isabel.\n\nWILLIAM AMOS ROHLF, distinguished Iowa surgeon, has attained many honors in the course of his labors and one of the most gratifying to him personally came when he was elected president of the Iowa State Medical Association for the year beginning May, 1930. It was a well deserved professional compliment paid to a man who for thirty-three years has practiced at Waverly and during that time has given a reputation to this Iowa city as a surgical center out of all proportion to its population.\n\nDoctor Rohlf was born in Davenport, Iowa, January 5, 1867, son of Amos and Doris (Schroeder) Rohlf. His parents were natives of Germany, and his father was eleven and his mother nine when they were brought to America, their respective families leaving the old country and seeking the new to be rid of some of the oppressive laws and customs there. Amos Rohlf was a shoemaker by trade, but in 1872 located on a farm in Scott County, and after retiring lived at Sheldon, Iowa. He and his wife were devout Lutherans.\n\nDoctor Rohlf was one of a family of seven sons and two daughters. His early life was spent on a farm.
