        "text": "Big Ten Rentals has been in business for over 35 years. We have set up events for several past presidents: President Donald J. Trump, President Barack Obama, President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush, countless other political events, festivals, wedding ceremonies, wedding receptions, corporate events, and other event types. We get the job done right and on time. Our company motto has always been “For a good time call.” This is also important during the planning and setup, not just for the event itself. Planning can be stressful. We have years of experience to make it easier."
