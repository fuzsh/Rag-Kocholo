        "text": "Philadelphia, the city of possibility, has been the starting point of all the changes that many of us have experienced growing up. As long as you can see City Hall, you know where to go. However, what do you see when you look at City Hall? As a community, how can we process the changes and improvements that we want to see in our city when our hands are tied by constantly changing laws? Today, a leader discussed the importance of people working together as a team to bring about change. It's time to come together, share ideas, and work towards a common goal. Whether City Hall is your focal point or not, we all have a role to play in making Philadelphia a better place for everyone. Let's continue to dream, imagine, and create a better future for our city. Together, we can make it happen. #Philadelphia #Community #Teamwork #Change #BetterFuture\n\nJim Crow is an important part of Nashville's legacy because it represents a dark chapter in the city's history, one characterized by racial segregation, discrimination, and systemic oppression. The implementation of Jim Crow laws in Nashville and throughout Tennessee had profound and lasting effects on the city's African American community, shaping social, economic, and political structures for generations. The legacy of Jim Crow in Nashville is evident in various aspects of the city's history and culture. Segregated neighborhoods, schools, and public facilities, as well as the unequal allocation of resources and opportunities, continue to influence patterns of inequality and segregation in Nashville today. Additionally, the resistance and activism of Nashville's African American community against Jim Crow, exemplified by events such as the Nashville Sit-Ins of 1960, are integral parts of the city's Civil Rights Movement history and contribute to its legacy of resilience and struggle for justice. While significant progress has been made since the end of legal segregation, the legacy of Jim Crow remains a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges of racism and inequality in Nashville and serves as a call to action for continued efforts to address systemic injustices and build a more inclusive and equitable city for all residents. We at THG strive to create inclusive neighborhoods and empower all of its citizens. Recognizing and confronting this legacy is essential for understanding Nashville's history and working towards a more just and united community. #NashvilleJimCrowLegacy #ResilienceThroughStruggle #EqualityForAllNashvillians\n\nMore than any other American city over the past 40 years, Miami has transformed itself into a global center for business, sports, arts, and hospitality. To continue to prosper, Miami must work for all its residents. Today, a surge of investment offers Miami the momentum it needs to chart a path to sustained growth. Capturing the full potential of this opportunity requires a deliberate, coordinated, and strategic path forward. We established the Partnership for Miami for that reason. We are business leaders acting in the civic interest to build a world-class city that balances growth and affordability, champions smart development, shores up school systems and government institutions, and maintains the natural and built environment to ensure it is thriving and resilient for decades to come. To advance this vision, in partnership with dozens of stakeholders, we developed \"Miami 2035: A Miami That Works for All,\" a civic agenda for Miami-Dade County. Our fervent hope is that this agenda contributes to deep reflection on the kind of city we seek to create, unlocks a new level of civic commitment across our community, and brings about the actions required to build a Miami that works for everyone.

They are shaping Chicago‚Äôs narrative for the next generation. They serve as global ambassadors for Chicago‚Äôs brand. And they are undoubtedly the city‚Äôs most valuable asset. In his article, Philip makes the case for celebrating and investing in Chicago‚Äôs culture-makers. He offers a counterpoint to all the pearl-clutching about Chicago‚Äôs reputational challenges. And he argues that the cities that are successfully repositioning themselves are those that recognize the assets already embedded in their communities. #opinion #cities #economicempowerment #publicsphereprojects\n\nüé® Let's continue to support and invest in the recovery of the creative sector.

Story by Kari Smith | Video by Demetrius Pipkin, Jeremy Moorhead and FJ Feng, CNN ‚Äî \"This dynamic city on the James River deserves more of the tourist attention enjoyed by the nation‚Äôs capital two hours to the north. Richmond, Virginia ‚Äî or ‚ÄúRVA,‚Äù as locals call it ‚Äî has top-notch museums and intriguing neighborhoods, and it‚Äôs a great spot for dining, drinking and getting outdoors. There‚Äôs an impressive arts scene and a nearly year-round lineup of festivals. And the city is taking a hard look at its complicated history ‚Äî as the capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War and a historic slave trading hub ‚Äî and working on ways to better tell the city‚Äôs full story. Now‚Äôs a great time for visitors to see for themselves how Virginia‚Äôs capital city has evolved.\" ------- Richmond is dynamic and thriving, and this CNN story and ranking proves that consistent hard work pays off. @rvagov embraces all that we are becoming. Our artists, musicians, students, business owners, culturalists, foodies, and lovers of wine all help paint a brilliant landscape and weave an interesting tapestry that is Richmond. @rvagov @venturerichmond #buildingcommunity #wearerva\n\nIn December 2023, I was invited by Courtney Christensen from Kansas City Public Library to give a keynote to open their 150th anniversary celebrations. In January I learned that ART IN THE LOOP FOUNDATION, the public art program for #KansasCity run by Downtown Council of Kansas City, had been so inspired by the talk that they had chosen #convivencia as the theme for their public art summer with KC STREETCAR AUTHORITY. This is the impact that I hoped to see from my research. In my latest newsletter, Ann Holliday and Edwing Mendez talk about how the capability of #coexistence transformed into more than 20 performances and installations. I find this story of Kansas City so inspiring. The big takeaways from it are: 1. There is no greater tool for communicating values than #publicart. 2. Public authorities have power and should use their power on how public spaces are used as a platform for the arts. 3. The biggest investments in the arts are not done by growing the cultural budget but incorporating the arts into public infrastructure. 4. Even when working on serious subjects, like downturn revitalization, do not forget play and wonder.

It reminded me of the power of community engagement and the importance of taking action to drive change. Years ago, I considered a political career, but my wife and I decided it wasn't the right path for us. Instead, I focused on connecting with our local representatives, believing that true change starts with us. During our conversation, we discussed the book \"A Quiet Revolution,\" which explores the history of Jacksonville's consolidation. Jacksonville Historical Society Both Councilman Boylan and I share a passion for history and a vision for progress in our city. We reflected on the challenges and the numerous failed attempts to unite and advance Jacksonville over the years. One of the biggest questions remains: how do you unite a community divided in the largest city by land mass in the USA? While I am still working on the answer, I know that getting involved and building relationships is a significant step forward. As a private citizen, I've had the privilege of connecting with some of the best professionals and actively participating in our community. My passion lies in solving problems and fostering resilience in relationships. Nothing happens unless you make it happen. It takes everyone to participate in creating and sustaining livable communities. Everything starts with you! Let's take action, show up, and work together to make City of Jacksonville the best place to live on earth. #CommunityEngagement #LocalLeadership #Jacksonville #WarriorToLove #ShowUp #Inspiration #TakeAction"
