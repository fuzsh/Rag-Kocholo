In that time, we’ve taken a great deal of pride in the fact that we’ve remained a family owned and operated business. The company was founded by Harry C Crowl Sr, Amy’s grandfather in 1923, Amy’s grandfather, father and uncle modeled how to run a company. Their motto: all people who come into the office: owners, tenants, and contractors deserve to be treated like family with care, integrity and honesty. Kurt and Amy strive every day to enact that philosophy.\n\nIf you’re looking for a terrific new place to live for you and your family and want to be a part of a true community that cares, you’ve come to the right place.
