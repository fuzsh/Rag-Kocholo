        "text": "Introduction\n\nLocated in the American Heartland, the state of Iowa is known for its gently rolling prairies and rich farmland that stretches as far as the eye can see. It is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the United States. In one way or another, most Iowans are dependent upon their state’s fertile soil and the bountiful crops it produces. More than four-fifths of the state’s total land area is in farms. Iowa plays a major role in feeding the U.S. population, and it consistently ranks among the top states in the production of hogs, corn (maize), and soybeans.\n\nAgricultural production improved dramatically in Iowa in the 20th century, with mechanization and the planting of hybrid crops as well as the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Ironically, the resulting crop surpluses sometimes brought hard times to Iowa. In the 1970s farmers borrowed heavily—using their land and equipment as collateral for the loans—to finance expansion at a time when land values were inflated and farm prices were strong. But bumper harvests in the 1980s caused commodity prices to fall, and the reduced farm income gradually brought about record foreclosures on the devalued farmland. In search of greater opportunity, young Iowans began emigrating from the rural areas to the cities of their own and other states. The result was that Iowa entered the 21st century as an agricultural state seriously lacking in agricultural workers.\n\nMeanwhile, Iowa began diversifying its economy. Yet even industry reflects the agricultural orientation of the state’s economy. Food processing and the manufacture of farm equipment are major industries. Other areas of diversification include chemical production, electronics, appliances, insurance, telecommunications, and biotechnology.\n\nAccording to a Native American legend, the state was named by a party of Sauk and Meskwaki (Fox) who had ventured across the Mississippi River in search of fresh hunting grounds. Spellbound by the splendor of the new land, their chief claimed it with his spear and proclaimed something that sounded like Iowa. The actual source of the name, however, is still debated. Historians are only sure that the Iowa River and the state were named after a tribe that had nearly died out there before white settlement encroached.\n\nWritten forms of the name appeared in the records kept by French (Ayouas, Aiouez, Ayavois), Spanish (Ajoues), and English-speaking (Aiouways, Ioways) explorers and trappers. One interpretation relates these misspellings to the name ayuxwa, the Dakota Indian name for the Iowa tribe (meaning “one who puts to sleep” or “drowsy one”). In the Siouan dialect of the Iowa tribe, it supposedly means “dusty faces.” Other translations are “nonesuch,” “this is the place,” “beautiful land,” and, in the Dakota language, “something to write with.” The first use of the modern spelling of Iowa was on a 1778 map drawn up by a geographer and military engineer named Thomas Hutchins.\n\nThe nickname Hawk-eyes was proposed for Iowans in 1838 by James G. Edwards, a newspaper editor, to “rescue from oblivion a memento, at least, of the name of the old chief”—Black Hawk. A leader of the Sauk people, Black Hawk died in Iowa later that year in the custody of a rival Sauk chief. In addition to the Hawkeye State, other nicknames for Iowa are the Corn State and Land Where the Tall Corn Grows. Area 56,273 square miles (145,745 square kilometers). Population (2020) 3,190,369. (See also Iowa in focus.)\n\nSurvey of the Hawkeye State\n\nIowa lies in the north-central part of the United States. The Mississippi River forms the state’s eastern boundary, separating Iowa from Wisconsin and Illinois. The Big Sioux and Missouri rivers form the state’s western boundary, separating Iowa from South Dakota and Nebraska. On the north Iowa is bounded by Minnesota; on the south, by Missouri.\n\nIn shape Iowa forms a rough rectangle. From east to west the state’s greatest length is 300 miles (483 kilometers). Its greatest width is 200 miles (322 kilometers).\n\nNatural Regions\n\nA number of times during the latest ice age most of Iowa was covered by giant glaciers. These shaped the physical features of Iowa as well as a large part of the northern Midwest. They transformed most of Iowa into a level prairie plain.\n\nThe Central Lowland, which is the state’s one major region, is a part of the Interior Plains division of the United States. The rough northeastern corner of the state was covered by only the first of the four major continental glaciations. This area, called the Wisconsin Driftless Section, extends into southwestern Wisconsin, northwestern Illinois, and southeastern Minnesota.\n\nIowa’s highest point, 1,670 feet (509 meters), is located in the northwestern corner on a glacial drift near Sibley. From the northwest the land slopes down toward the southeast and south, forming the state’s watershed. Iowa’s rivers flow eastward into the Mississippi and westward into the Missouri. The Cedar, Iowa, Des Moines, and other rivers in the eastern two-thirds of the state flow southeastward into the Mississippi. In the northwest the Little Sioux, Big Sioux, and Floyd drain southwest into the Missouri.\n\nThe lowest point in the state, 480 feet (146 meters), is in Lee county at the Mississippi River. There are two chief breaks in Iowa’s level sweep of land. Steep cliffs rise from the Mississippi in the northeastern section, and low, moundlike bluffs rise above the prairies in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nClimate\n\nIowa has a continental climate, meaning it has hot summers and cold winters. Winter temperatures vary from an average of about 14 °F (–10 °C) in the northwestern part of the state to the low 20s F (about –6 °C) in the southeastern part. Summer temperatures average in the mid-80s F (about 30 °C) but rarely reach 100 °F (38 °C).\n\nThe summer growing season, for warm-weather crops, is about 150 days. The spring and fall growing seasons, for oats and other hardy grains and grasses, are about 50 days and 40 days, respectively. Iowa’s climate is ideally suited to the growing of staple crops, but it discourages the growing of fruits.\n\nPrecipitation is seasonal, falling mostly in the summer. The annual average rainfall ranges from less than 26 inches (66 centimeters) in the northwest to more than 38 inches (96 centimeters) in the southeast. Snow cover seldom remains throughout the winter months. However, heavy snowfalls have occurred in Iowa in late autumn and early spring.\n\nIowa sometimes experiences severe flooding as a result of rapid snow melt and heavy summer rainstorms. Some of the most devastating flooding occurred in 1993, when Iowa received twice its average annual rainfall. Much of the state remained flooded for four months, with roads inaccessible, water systems inoperable, housing uninhabitable,and farmland unusable. The state was again hit with disastrous floods in 2008, and thousands of people had to be evacuated.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nAlmost all of Iowa’s native prairie and wetland vegetation has been cleared to make room for agriculture. Today less than one-tenth of the land is forested. The most common trees include hardwoods such as oak, hickory, maple, elm, black walnut, and wild cherry. Woodlands thrive along the rivers and in the hillier parts of the state.\n\nIowa’s wildlife includes deer, raccoons, opossums, squirrels, and chipmunks. The river otter has been reintroduced, as has the wild turkey, after becoming virtually extinct in the 1960s. The ring-necked pheasant, imported in the early 20th century, remains an important game bird. Other bird species include the goldfinch, oriole, cardinal, bunting, blue jay, and bluebird. Conservation efforts in recent decades have led to a resurgence of the bald eagle in Iowa. These birds can be seen widely throughout the state in winter, especially near the Mississippi River. Bass, trout, pike, and carp are found in Iowa’s rivers and streams.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, when most of the Iowa region was still occupied by Native Americans, white settlers began moving in. Many of these settlers came from the southern and eastern United States. Some were trappers and lead miners. Others began to farm the land. In the 1840s a second wave of immigration began. The new settlers were Irish, German, Dutch, Czech, and Scandinavian. Descendants of these and other European immigrants make up the great majority of Iowa’s population today. Non-Hispanic whites account for more than four-fifths of the state’s residents. African Americans and Asian Americans each make up less than 5 percent, and the Native American population is even smaller. Iowa has one federally recognized Native American tribe, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa. Also known as the Meskwaki Nation, the tribe owns the Meskwaki Settlement in the central part of the state.\n\nIowa is home to a small but growing Hispanic community. Since the middle of the 20th century many Mexican and Mexican American migrant workers who came to the state to harvest fruits and vegetables in the Mississippi Valley have chosen to stay. In the 1980s more Spanish-speaking workers began taking jobs in meatpacking plants in Iowa. Though mainly from Mexico or Texas, these workers also included Central and South Americans.\n\nCities\n\nAbout two-thirds of Iowans live in cities or towns. Des Moines, the state capital and largest city, is a center for insurance and manufacturing in central Iowa. Outside of Des Moines, the largest metropolitan areas in the state are Cedar Rapids, and Iowa City, and Waterloo–Cedar Falls in eastern Iowa; Sioux City on the Missouri River; the complex of Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, farther south on the Missouri; the so-called Quad Cities complex of Davenport, Bettendorf, and three Illinois cities on the Mississippi River; and Dubuque, across from Illinois on the Mississippi, near the Wisconsin border.\n\nEducation\n\nBy the time Iowa was made a territory in 1838, more than 40 schools had already been established. A law to set up free schools was passed in 1840. In 1858 the state legislature passed the law upon which the present system of public education is based. A compulsory education law was passed in 1902.\n\nBecause of its large rural population, Iowa had many one-room schoolhouses that stood at regular intervals, 2 to 4 miles (3 to 6 kilometers) apart. Later, school district reorganization eliminated all one-room elementary schools.\n\nIowa has many colleges and junior colleges. State schools include the University of Iowa, in Iowa City; Iowa State University, in Ames; and the University of Northern Iowa, in Cedar Falls. Among the outstanding research scientists at the University of Iowa was physicist James A. Van Allen. Grinnell College, in Grinnell, is a standout among the state’s many small liberal arts colleges. Other Iowa colleges and universities include Drake University, in Des Moines; Luther College, in Decorah; Wartburg College, in Waverly; Coe College, in Cedar Rapids; Cornell College, in Mount Vernon; and Iowa Wesleyan College, in Mount Pleasant.\n\nSports and Recreation\n\nYear-round recreation is provided by Iowa’s rivers, lakes, and woodlands. Hunting, fishing, boating, camping, swimming, and ice-skating are among Iowans’ favorite outdoor activities. The so-called Great Lakes region in the northwestern part of the state is a popular summer and winter playground. Many of Iowa’s 19,000 miles (31,000 kilometers) of fishing streams and rivers are regularly stocked with sport fish—trout, bass, and perch. There are regular hunting seasons each year for deer, pheasant, quail, and other animals.\n\nState-owned recreation areas include about 100 state parks, recreation reserves, and lake reserves. Many of the lakes are artificial, having been created especially for recreational purposes. Unusual earthen mounds are the chief attraction of Effigy Mounds National Monument, near Marquette.\n\nAlthough Iowa lacks professional sports teams, college sports draw many fans. In every college town in the state, football weekends form the center of the autumn social season. The focus of football excitement for most in the state is Kinnick Stadium, home of the University of Iowa, which belongs to the Big Ten Conference. The University of Northern Iowa football team also has a long record of success, and Iowa State University competes in the tough Big 12 Conference. Men’s basketball is also prominent at all three universities and at Drake University. Wrestling is hugely popular in Iowa at both the high-school and college levels, and the University of Iowa and Iowa State programs are among the most dominant in the sport.\n\nArts and Cultural Sites\n\nDes Moines, Cedar Rapids, and Davenport, Iowa’s largest cities, support a number of performing arts organizations. Cedar Rapids hosts the Cedar Rapids Opera Theatre and Orchestra Iowa, and Des Moines is home to the Des Moines Metro Opera, the Des Moines Symphony, and Ballet Des Moines. The Quad Cities (Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa and Moline, East Moline, and Rock Island in Illinois) support a symphony and an opera company as well.\n\nFine art museums can be found in cities and towns throughout Iowa. The Cedar Rapids Museum of Art is home to the world’s largest collection of Grant Wood paintings, and the Mooney Art Collection in Charles City is small but holds works of art from such masters as Rembrandt, Pablo Picasso, and Salvador Dalí. Contemporary art can be viewed at the Clarinda Carnegie Art Museum, in Clarinda, and the collections at Davenport’s Figge Art Museum span from the 15th century to the present.\n\nColleges and universities play an important role in Iowa’s cultural life. Public and private institutions of higher education run music, art, and theater programs that provide opportunities for students to perform in front of audiences. The University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop is one of the country’s premier creative writing programs. Its graduates and faculty have won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and MacArthur Foundation Fellowships and have been named poet laureate of the United States. Grant Wood worked in Iowa and joined the University of Iowa faculty after painting American Gothic (1930), one of the most recognizable images in the world.\n\nThe Grout Museum District in Waterloo includes several institutions: the Grout Museum of History and Science, the Rensselaer Russell House Museum, the Snowden House, the Bluedorn Science Imaginarium, and the Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum. The museums provide ample opportunities to explore science and the history and culture of Iowa.\n\nFor brief biographies of some notable people of Iowa, click here.\n\nEconomy\n\nIowa struggled for years for economic stability after the nationwide recession in the 1980s. The state began the 21st century with another economic problem: the loss of young people to urban areas and other states left Iowa lacking in agricultural workers. In response to this situation, the state government offered tax incentives, loans, and educational packages to encourage companies to locate in Iowa.\n\nAgriculture\n\nIowa’s most valuable natural resources are its soil and climate, which make farming and livestock raising so profitable. With most of its area in crops or pasture, it ranks among the top states in extent of farmland. Iowa has never had a total crop failure.\n\nIowa ranks at or near the top among the states in the production of corn, soybeans, oats, hogs, and cattle and calves. Much of its corn is used to feed livestock. Sheep are also raised for meat and for wool. Dairying, which provides valuable milk and butter, is an important industry in the northeastern part of the state.\n\nIndustry\n\nIowa’s industries are spread throughout the state. The leading industry is food processing, especially meat and grain products. Other important manufactures include machinery, chemicals, fabricated metal products, computer and electronic products, and plastics and rubber products. John Deere, one of the world’s largest corporations in the manufacture of agricultural equipment, has plants in Davenport, Des Moines, Dubuque, Ottumwa, and Waterloo.\n\nIowa once had the world’s largest lead and zinc deposits. They have since been worked out, leaving nonmetallic minerals as the chief mineral resources. The most significant minerals are crushed stone, sand and gravel, and cement. Iowa is also a top producer of gypsum. Iowa leads the country in the production of ethanol, a liquid fuel that is created by fermenting starch or sugar.\n\nIowa’s Department of Natural Resources, with the cooperation of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has been responsible for the construction of several notable dams in Iowa. Among the flood-control projects are the Red Rock and Saylorville dams, on the Des Moines River; the Coralville Dam, on the Iowa River; and the Rathbun Dam, on the Chariton River. There are hydroelectric power plants on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, such as the major Mississippi River plant that was constructed at Keokuk in 1913. Iowa is also a major producer of wind power.\n\nServices\n\nServices are the main economic activity in Iowa. Within this sector, the greatest contributors to the gross state product (the total value of goods and services produced in a year) include banking and insurance, government, real estate, health care, and wholesale and retail trade. In addition to being the state capital, Des Moines has long been home to national corporations, banks, and publishing houses. The Cedar Rapids–Iowa City corridor is home to technology companies and research facilities affiliated with the University of Iowa in Iowa City. Agribusiness firms are prevalent throughout the state.\n\nTourism is also an important economic activity. Some of Iowa’s major attractions are the Lewis and Clark State Park, Fort Madison on the Mississippi River, the Grotto of the Redemption in West Bend, and Effigy Mounds National Monument. Motion pictures have also played a role in attracting tourists to Iowa—namely, The Bridges of Madison County (1995) and Field of Dreams (1989). The latter movie was partly filmed on a baseball diamond sculpted into a cornfield in Dyersville, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Dubuque. Today thousands of tourists visit the site annually.\n\nTransportation\n\nThe first European settlers in Iowa walked or rode horseback along narrow Native American trails. Later these trails were widened into wagon roads. When the Iowa Territory was organized in 1838, the federal government gave the territory money to build a road from Dubuque to the Missouri state line to facilitate the movement of soldiers in case of frontier difficulties. Later the Mormon Trail across the southern part of the state was established by a group of Mormons on their journey from Illinois to Utah. With the advent of the automobile, it was largely over the early wagon roads and military highways that Iowa’s modern highway system was developed.\n\nIowa is bordered by two major rivers that are both navigable—the Mississippi and the Missouri. These rivers were the first significant transportation routes in the area. Today Iowa goods can go by water to seaports on the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. Although there is no regular schedule for river traffic on the Missouri, occasionally large steamers go up the river as far as Sioux City. Barge traffic accounts for most of the commercial transportation on both these rivers.\n\nSome commercial use is made of the rivers within the state, but Iowa’s railroads and road network carry most of its traffic. Major north-south routes are Interstates 35 and 29 and US 75, 59, 71, 169, 69, 65, 218, 63, 52, 61, and 67. The chief east-west highways are Interstate 80 and US 18, 20, 151, 30, 6, and 34.\n\nIowa’s first railroad, the Mississippi and Missouri, began operation in 1855. It ran between Davenport and Muscatine. In 1856 a train crossed the Mississippi at Davenport on the first railroad bridge to be completed across the river. Today about two-fifths of the country’s freight is still transported by rails that cross Iowa.\n\nIowa is centrally located for air travel within the United States. The Des Moines International Airport is the state’s largest airport.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first people of what is now Iowa were Paleo-Indians, the earliest ancestors of Native Americans. They probably occupied parts of the area some 14,000 years ago. The Paleo-Indian hunters and food gatherers had to endure the periodic droughts that continue to plague the region today. Even after people began to settle and farm in western Iowa about ad 800, entire villages occasionally disappeared. In eastern Iowa, peoples known for building effigy mounds—earthen mounds in the shape of animals—occupied settlements from about ad 300 until the 17th century.\n\nMost of the early Native Americans spoke languages of the Siouan family. However, tribes speaking Algonquian languages were important in eastern Iowa after the 17th century, often displacing the western tribes in bloody conflicts. The Iowa people were nearly annihilated shortly before dense Euro-American settlement began, but they remained a presence in the state into the 1800s. (See also Northeast Indians; Plains Indians.)\n\nEuropean Exploration and Settlement\n\nIn the latter part of the 17th century the French explorers Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, and Louis Hennepin touched the borders of Iowa, but for the next century there were few white settlements in the area. In 1788 Julien Dubuque set up a trading post and received permission from the Meskwaki people to work lead mines on their land near the site of the city named for him. Soon Iowa’s fur-bearing animals attracted traders and trappers. Small trading posts were set up along the Mississippi and other rivers. Gradually, these small trading settlements grew into the first towns in the area. Few of the early trappers and traders attempted to farm the land.\n\nExplorers continued to visit the area during the early 19th century. They sent stories to the East telling about the Iowa region’s fertile prairie lands. One of these explorers was Zebulon M. Pike, who surveyed the upper Mississippi Valley in 1805. The Sauk and Meskwaki ceded a tract of their land in 1824, and the pioneer population began to grow. The first non-Indian child was born in 1829, a year before the first school was organized near Galland.\n\nSome of the earliest settlers traveled in overland wagon trains. Others came up the Mississippi River by steamboat. They settled in towns along the river and shipped their produce to St. Louis, Missouri, in return for manufactured goods. During this time bands of Native Americans roamed over Iowa’s broad prairies. After a brief war in 1832, however, Chief Black Hawk of the Sauk surrendered the Sauk and Meskwaki claim to eastern Iowa. Other tribes also gave up their lands through treaties with the government in the 1830s and ’40s. The Iowa people moved to a reservation on what is now the Kansas-Nebraska border in 1836. The Sauk and Meskwaki, treated as a single group by the U.S. government, lost their Iowa land by treaty in 1845. They were moved to a reservation in Kansas, though some managed to stay in Iowa and others soon returned.\n\nFrom Territory to Statehood\n\nIowa had a difficult time becoming a separate territory. The Iowa region was a part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Congress at first placed the District of Louisiana, including what is now Iowa, under the control of the Indiana Territory. The following year the Louisiana Territory was established.\n\nAs this area was gradually subdivided, Iowa came under the jurisdiction of a series of territories. In 1812 the Iowa region was included in the Missouri Territory. It remained there until Missouri became a state in 1821. For the next 13 years Iowa was without civil government. In 1834 it was made a part of the Michigan Territory, and in 1836 it became a part of the Wisconsin Territory. Finally, in 1838, Wisconsin was divided to create the Iowa Territory.\n\nThe first territorial governor of Iowa was General Robert Lucas, a former governor of Ohio. The population of the Iowa Territory was initially 23,242, but by 1850 it had grown to almost 200,000. This rapid settlement brought demands for statehood. However, Iowa had almost as much difficulty becoming a state as it had becoming a territory. As desire for statehood grew, the determination of Iowa’s borders presented a problem. In 1844 the territorial convention agreed on a state constitution and boundaries and submitted those proposals to the U.S. Congress for approval.\n\nThe suggested boundaries extended from the Mississippi River on the east to the Missouri on the west, as those of the present state do. The boundaries on the north, however, took in all of southeastern Minnesota but did not include all of what is now northwest Iowa. Congress returned the constitution after amending it to make a much smaller state. The voters of the territory twice rejected the boundaries proposed by Congress. A compromise was reached in 1846, fixing the boundaries as they are today, and on December 28 of that year Iowa became the 29th state in the Union.\n\nThe territory had not been fully explored when Iowa became a state. Several Native American tribes continued to wage war on the white settlers, but they failed to stem the tide of relentless westward expansion. In 1851 the Sioux surrendered the last Native American–owned land in Iowa to the United States. Several brief uprisings followed, but the massacre of about 30 settlers by a Sioux band at Spirit Lake in 1857 was the last outbreak of Native American warfare in Iowa. Meanwhile, however, the Iowa legislature passed a law in 1856 that allowed the Meskwaki to remain in the state. The Meskwaki bought a piece of land—the Meskwaki Settlement—in Tama county in central Iowa in 1857 and later expanded it with additional purchases,\n\nThe Modern State\n\nIowa has always been a progressive state. Before the American Civil War the state was overwhelmingly against slavery. More than 75,000 of its men fought for the North—almost one-tenth of the state’s population at that time. The word white was removed from the qualifications for legislative office in 1880, and a civil rights act of 1939 gave all persons “full and equal enjoyment” of public places. Iowa was one of the first states to enact a law prohibiting the sale and consumption of liquor, in 1847. In 1907 Des Moines became one of the first cities in the country to adopt a commission form of government (see municipal government). Capital punishment was abolished in Iowa in 1965.\n\nDuring the 1860s and ’70s Iowa was a center of the Granger movement. The movement consisted of farmers who favored lower railroad shipping rates and higher prices for farm products. Beginning about 1920 the Farm Bureau Federation replaced the Granger movement as the chief spokesman for Iowa farmers. In 1955 the National Farmers Organization was organized in Iowa.\n\nLate in the 1950s an event occurred that greatly improved the agricultural segment of the state’s economy. On a visit to the United States, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited a farm near Coon Rapids. That visit helped cement relations between Iowa and the Soviet Union, as the state became a major exporter of grain to the Soviet Union. International trade earned Iowa more than $2 billion a year, while helping deplete the national farm surpluses. When President Jimmy Carter forced a grain embargo following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Iowa’s farmers were hurt economically. The embargo was canceled after President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981.\n\nIowa was the only state that lost population in the first decade of the 20th century, but from 1910 to 1980 the population grew steadily. In the 1980s Iowa’s population fell by nearly 5 percent as a result of the farm crisis, in which lower crop prices led to the collapse of many farms and a significant out-migration of young people. The state population rebounded in the 1990s, growing by more than 5 percent.\n\nBy the turn of the 21st century Iowa had become more ethnically diverse, mainly because of the increasing number of Hispanic residents. Although still fiercely proud of their agricultural heritage, Iowans embraced a more diversified economy, focused on services as well as biotechnology and research and development. (See also United States, “North Central Plains.”)\n\nSome Notable People of Iowa\n\nCarrie Chapman Catt (1859–1947)\n\nCarrie Chapman Catt’s leadership was essential in the woman suffrage movement. Catt attended college in Iowa and became a high-school principal in Mason City in 1881. From 1887 to 1890 she worked for the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association, and in 1900 she was elected to succeed Susan B. Anthony as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Catt’s strategy and organization had a huge impact on the adoption in 1920 of the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Catt was also a strong advocate of the peace movement. (See also Carrie Chapman Catt.)\n\nHerbert Hoover (1874–1964)\n\nHerbert Hoover served as the 31st president of the United States from 1929 to 1933. Hoover was born in West Branch. After graduating from Stanford University with a degree in geology, he became a mining engineer and worked all over the world. During and after World War I Hoover headed organizations that helped feed soldiers and hungry people in Europe. He became U.S. president a few months before the Great Depression began. People blamed him as the economy worsened, and his programs failed to end the crisis. He was not reelected. Hoover’s presidential library is in West Branch.
