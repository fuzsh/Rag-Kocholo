        "text": "Youth-Driven Leadership\n\nAMP helps young people become advocates for themselves, giving them a voice to impact child welfare policies and practices. Through supportive, productive partnerships, youth speak out to make foster care more responsive and effective.\n\nAMP youth also educate legislators, child welfare professionals, juvenile court representatives, foster parents, and the public about foster care and adoption from a youth perspective.\n\nAMP Youth Council Locations\n\nLocal AMP youth councils are available in the following locations: Ames, Burlington, Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, Dubuque, Eldora, Fort Dodge, Marshalltown, Mason City, Ottumwa, Sioux City, and Waterloo.\n\nAn AMP facilitator is also available to travel to councils located within youth facilities.\n\nSamanthya's Story\n\nSamanthya Marlatt first heard of YSS when she entered foster care at age 11.\n\nAs she grew up, YSS was there every step of the way. \"Through all the ambiguity of entering foster care, aging out of foster care, moving homes—the one thing that was consistent was YSS,\" she says.\n\nSamanthya stayed connected through YSS's Aftercare program for foster care alumni. In 2022, her journey came full circle when she joined YSS as the new Program Manager for AMP.\n\n\"When I think about my history with YSS, as well as my passion for creating better outcomes for youth who experience foster care, it was a perfect fit,\" Samanthya says. \"It feels like being home.\"\n\nAMP Day on the Hill\n\nEach year, AMP youth form their official legislative agenda, which they share with Iowa’s governor, legislators, and the public at the event \"AMP Day on the Hill.\"\n\nFor 12 years, AMP Day on the Hill has been successful in making change for Iowa’s youth, passing laws that include implementing the Guardian Assistance Program to increase permanency for foster youth; strengthening Iowa code to keep siblings together in out-of-home placements; and allowing foster youth to remain in care until age 21.\n\nRead about the 2023 AMP Day on the Hill.\n\nAMP Camp\n\nEach year, foster care youth attended AMP Camp to network, discuss legislative advocacy, and participate in fun activities.\n\nDuring the week, dozens of youth enjoy fishing and swimming in the lake, campfire gatherings, dance parties, games, and arts and crafts.\n\nIn addition, campers participate in meaningful activities such as strategic storytelling, color personality tests, and a cookie-baking contest to demonstrate that each youth—like each recipe—is unique and valued.\n\nRead more about 2022 AMP Camp.\n\nIowa Aftercare Services Network (IASN)\n\nEntering adulthood comes with making many important decisions, and it can be a tough time.\n\nFor young adults who have experienced foster care or other out-of-home placement, YSS provides support to help move toward stability and self-sufficiency.\n\nSince 2002, YSS has proudly served as the lead agency of the IASN, a state-wide program for young people (ages 18-23) who have aged out of foster care. We work with young adults as equal partners in creating and meeting their individualized goals.\n\nThe IASN is funded by the Iowa Department of Human Services. For more information, visit iowaaftercare.org.\n\nYuli's Story\n\nWhen Yuli turned 18 and left her foster care placement, she didn’t know where to turn. Legally an adult—but unsure how to be on her own—Yuli was in a tough situation many foster care alumni face.\n\nThankfully, she found the Aftercare program at YSS. Yuli also accessed therapy services at YSS to prioritize her mental health and manage her anxiety. “The Aftercare program at YSS has helped me stay on track,” Yuli says. “The staff truly care for me; they make sure I have everything I need.”\n\nA year after aging out of foster care, Yuli now has an apartment, works full-time, and attends community college. Yuli is grateful for her Aftercare Self-Sufficiency Advocate, who continually helps her with budgeting and checks in on how she’s doing.\n\n“Honestly, I don’t know what I would do without that support from YSS,” Yuli explains. “It feels like a family to me. They help me in so many ways—it’s amazing.”"
