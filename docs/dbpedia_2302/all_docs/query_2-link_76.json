        "text": "I missed this Des Moines Register story last week:\n\nIowa state environmental regulators want to shelve for as long as three years new rules intended to keep toxic coal ash out of Iowa’s water supplies, largely because of industry protests.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the state is caving in to industry pressure while putting Iowans’ drinking water supplies, and health, at risk.\n\nThe article quotes Carrie La Seur, founder of Plains Justice, as saying she learned on December 30\n\nthat Iowa regulators agreed to postpone action on their new rules after companies that handle ash waste questioned the true health risk and objected to potential costs associated with the changes that they said would be passed on to consumers.\n\nInstead, the firms offered to install monitoring wells to check whether ash is polluting water around unlined former gravel pits and ravines where the material is used as fill.\n\nCoal ash typically contains a variety of heavy metals that can cause cancer, neurological and developmental problems, and other illnesses. The pollutants include arsenic, lead, mercury and boron, which are concentrated at levels in the ash that are far above the amount found in coal.\n\nIn 2007 Plains Justice produced an Iowa Coal Combustion Waste Disposal Report. Click the link to download the report.\n\nLa Seur told the Des Moines Register that Plains Justice is particularly concerned about storing coal ash near rivers.\n\nWith good reason, because the recent billion-gallon coal ash spill in Tennessee may be even worse for the environment and for human health than it first appeared.\n\nThis Daily Kos diary discusses the contaminants that have already been found in the Emory River since that accident:\n\nAll water samples were found to contain elevated levels of arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and thallium. The samples were taken from the immediate area of the coal waste spill, in front of the Kingston Fossil plant intake canal just downstream from the spill site, and at a power line crossing two miles downstream from the spill.\n\nThese pollutants will flow downstream to larger rivers, and they are likely to remain in the environment for a long time. Water near a similar accident in Kentucky remained devoid of aquatic life for years.\n\nEven worse, waste produced by coal plants contains radioactive compounds. Daily Kos diarist Hummingbird linked to a 2007 article from Scientific American: Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste. Click the link to read the very disturbing details.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Natural Resources should not back off from requiring coal ash storage facilities to have liners. That is a reasonable precaution, given how many hazardous substances are concentrated in the coal ash.\n\nThe Register says companies have offered to install wells to monitor whether contaminants are leaching from unlined ravines and gravel pits into groundwater. I hope the DNR will have the resources and commitment to follow through on this monitoring and check compliance. I do not want to take corporations’ word for it that the water around their storage facilities is fine.\n\nUnfortunately, the DNR is not always quick to investigate potential water quality problems.\n\nThe disaster in Tennessee should be a reminder to all that there is no such thing as clean coal, even if future technology were able to capture carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\n\nUPDATE: A commenter at Daily Kos pointed out that the timeline of the DNR’s decision is unclear. La Seur says she learned of plans to shelve the new disposal rules on December 30. But did the DNR make that decision before or after the Tennessee disaster occurred on December 22?\n\nIf you know the answer to this question, please e-mail me confidentially at desmoinesdem AT yahoo.com.\n\nSECOND UPDATE: I got this reply from La Seur:\n\nPlains Justice has been working with DNR on this rulemaking for most of the last year following our 2007 coal ash disposal report. We filed comments on a draft rulemaking at the end of the summer. DNR then announced that it would be issuing a second draft for comment in December. We were waiting on that when the TN coal ash spill happened. Because of TN we began to get press queries about Iowa’s status, so we called DNR to ask what was happening with the rulemaking. DNR told us that the rulemaking was being shelved because of industry resistance and DNR would be changing the website soon to reflect that change. To my knowledge there was no public notice or public hearing.\n\nWe’ve been publicizing this development and pursuing other actions in response. If anyone needs more information, give me a call at 319-362-2120.\n\nContinue Reading...\n\nLess than two weeks remain before the election. If you have time to volunteer this weekend, please contact a Democratic office to offer to help. Remember, there are many ways to help that do not involve phone calls to strangers or knocks on strangers’ doors.\n\nIf you live in the fourth or fifth Congressional districts, I encourage you to volunteer for Becky Greenwald or Rob Hubler. Or, contact the nearest field office for Barack Obama’s campaign.\n\nOne Iowa is also coordinating a “Weekend for Equality” volunteer effort. For more information, click here.\n\nIf nothing else, vote early so that other volunteers do not waste their time contacting you.\n\nThe other exciting event this weekend is another free concert in Des Moines by Justin Roberts and his Not Ready for Naptime Players. They’ll be playing in the lower court of Merle Hay Mall at 1 pm on Sunday. As I’ve written before, Justin’s music is fantastic, and his live shows are a lot of fun for kids and adults.\n\nPlease post a comment or send me an e-mail (desmoinesdem AT yahoo.com) if you know of another important event I’ve missed.\n\nThursday, October 23:\n\nBecky Greenwald will visit State Center and Eldora with State Senate candidate Steve Sodders and State House candidate Tim Hoy. They will be in State Center at 2 pm in the home of Rita Figgins, 502 4th St. SE. They will be at the Ahoy Foundation, 1266 Edgington Ave in Eldora, at 4 pm.\n\nRob Hubler is holding a “Servant versus the King” event at 7 pm on the Morningside Campus – UPS Hall, Sioux City.\n\nTom Harkin Senator Tom Harkin will attend a phone bank at the AFSCME Hall, District 61, 4320 NW 2nd Ave, Des Moines, from 5:30 to 8:30 pm. RSVP at\n\nhttp://my.barackobama.com/page…\n\nQuestions, Call Joseph O’Hern at 515-447-5888.\n\nFrom the Department of Natural Resources:\n\nA series of informational meetings to highlight proposed rule changes regarding public lands will be held in October in Des Moines, Dubuque and Spirit Lake. […] The primary intent of changing the rules is to clarify the application procedure, formalize the permit denial process and provide better management of public lands and waters. The proposed rules will also provide for potential penalties associated with the violation of permit conditions or failure to get a permit prior to construction on public lands. The proposed rules also provide for greater enforcement ability by the DNR in cases where private entities have encroached on public land.\n\nPublic lands are owned by the citizens of Iowa and include many lakes, 14 rivers, wildlife management areas, state forests and state parks.\n\nThe proposed rules do not pertain to docks which are covered under a separate chapter of Iowa law and have recently been revised. […]\n\n“The meetings will be an opportunity for the public to learn about what changes are being proposed, but it is also an opportunity for us to hear from the public. Policy always benefits when the public is able to participate in the discussion and provide valuable input,” said Ford-Shivvers.\n\n* Thursday, Oct. 23rd; 6-8 pm at EB Lyons Interpretive Center, Mines of Spain State Park, 8991 Bellevue Heights, Dubuque.\n\nFor more information, contact Inga Foster at 515-281-8967.\n\nFriday, October 24:\n\nAt 8 am, Rob Hubler will appear on the Conversations radio program with Dordt University’s President.\n\nBecky Greenwald will attend a house party at 1027 Angela Drive Indianola at 6 pm.\n\nIowa Public Television will broadcast a debate between Senator Tom Harkin and Christopher Reed at 7 pm.\n\nFrom Michael Richards (the full conference schedule is after the jump):\n\nSUSTAINABLE ECOLOGICAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT presents;\n\nSEED Conference II: A Wake-Up Call\n\nCedar Rapids, Iowa October 24/25 2008\n\nIn 2008 we have been hit with two of the most challenging crises in the history of Iowa;\n\n1. The most extreme flooding in the entire history of our state.\n\n2. The most serious global financial crisis in history.\n\nS.E.E.D Conference II will explore root causes of these two major crises.\n\nS.E.E.D provides an effective, non-partisan, local citizen capacity to activate reality based, sustainable solutions.\n\nFor thousands of years, the native ecology of Iowa was resilient, incredibly diverse with immense capacity to absorb water and sustain life. These natural systems have been dramatically disrupted through our uninformed policy and economic actions of the past 100 years. SEED serves as a community catalyst to apply intelligent biomimicry for land, water and resource management to restore ecological resilience.\n\nIowa has the base economic resources of fertile land, bountiful water and hard working, honest people. Out of necessity, we are entering a time of real economy; We will conserve, scale down, simplify, save, and spend prudently for the things that we actually need. We will now create a sustainable economy. As “The Sustainable State”, Iowa can lead the way to restore sane national economic systems and intelligent political discourse.\n\nThe false economy is collapsing, but the real economy remains. Did we forget how to make things that people need? Can we no longer grow local food? Did Iowa factories burn down? Are our tools lost? Did we run out of good people to work in farms, factories and offices? No! The real economy remains as our sustainable foundation. The present financial crisis is simply the evaporation of the false and illusory world of derivatives, collateralized debt, index funds, credit default swaps, structured investment vehicles, and the hard-sell marketing of sub-prime mortgages and super-sized homes. That house of cards has collapsed. We will now build a sane and sustainable economy.\n\nSix years ago as the Iraq war started, I launched Sustainable Ecological Economic Development (S.E.E.D.) to address root, causal factors of war; the deluded pursuit of the false and destructive economy of Empire rather than productive and sustainable Creative Enterprise. Economies based on Empire exploit other nations, the natural environment and even our own citizens through usury, labor exploitation, and unfair wealth-transfer through corporate welfare and coercive bailouts. Excessive national debt is irresponsibly relegated to future generations. Average U.S. Citizens have been reduced to powerless serfs, indentured by fear, complex webs of wealth-transfer taxation and oppressive debt to fuel the totally unsustainable military/industrial-Wall St. Machine. Our founding fathers would not recognize the State of our Nation. The bright light of the American Dream is now shrouded with dark clouds of fear, greed and deception. We need a wake-up call and restore our nation to ecological and economic health. The S.E.E.D. Conference is a call to community action.\n\n“Without vision, a people perish”-(Book of Proverbs)\n\nSix years ago, I issued a common sense clarion call to my fellow Iowans to shift out of Empire into Sustainable/Ecological Enterprise. That was a really good idea six years ago. Today, this paradigm shift is an urgent and absolute necessity. We invite you to build a Sustainable State.\n\n-Michael Richards, SEED Founder\n\nSaturday, October 25:\n\nIf you have time, volunteer for a Democratic campaign or a progressive interest group this weekend.

The first is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 14th in Des Moines.\n\nThe primary intent of changing the rules is to clarify the application procedure, formalize the permit denial process and provide better management of public lands and waters. The proposed rules will also provide for potential penalties associated with the violation of permit conditions or failure to get a permit prior to construction on public lands. The proposed rules also provide for greater enforcement ability by the DNR in cases where private entities have encroached on public land.\n\nPublic lands are owned by the citizens of Iowa and include many lakes, 14 rivers, wildlife management areas, state forests and state parks. The proposed rules do not pertain to docks which are covered under a separate chapter of Iowa law and have recently been revised.\n\n“We have been working hard within the department to create rules that are both fair, but also provide us with the safeguards we need to adequately protect the public land owned by Iowa’s citizens,” said Diane Ford-Shivvers, assistant administrator of the DNR’s Conservation and Recreation Division. Ford-Shivvers said the DNR wants the three public meetings to be active discussions on the proposed rules which are scheduled to go into effect next March.\n\n[…]\n\nThe three meetings are as follows:\n\n* Tuesday, Oct. 14th; 6-8 pm at the Des Moines Botanical Center, Walsh Room, 909 Robert D. Ray Drive, Des Moines\n\n* Thursday, Oct. 23rd; 6-8 pm at EB Lyons Interpretive Center, Mines of Spain State Park, 8991 Bellevue Heights, Dubuque.\n\n* Monday, Oct. 27th; 6-8 pm at the Dickinson County Community Building, 1602 15th St., in Spirit Lake.\n\nFrom the Sustainable Funding Coalition:\n\nThe Sustainable Funding Coalition, a diverse group of Iowa organizations (including INHF) that works for sustainable conservation funding, is sponsoring a series of candidate forums on the proposed Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund.\n\nSo you can make your voice heard on this important issue, this e-mail provides background information on the forums, a list of forum dates & locations, and pre-registration instructions.\n\nAbout the Fund: The proposed Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund would provide a permanent funding source to support efforts to improve and preserve Iowa’s water quality, soils, wildlife habitat, and outdoor recreation opportunities.\n\nTo create the fund, proposed legislation mandates that 3/8ths of a cent from state sales tax revenue will be appropriated for the Trust Fund the next time the Iowa legislature approves a sales tax increase. The Sustainable Funding Coalition hopes to pass Trust Fund legislation during Iowa’s 2009 legislative session. NOTE: This bill does not raise taxes, nor does it give voters the ability to raise the sales tax-only the legislature can do that.\n\nTen candidate forums scattered throughout the state provide a chance for citizens and legislators/candidates to discuss this legislation together. Please consider attending the forum nearest you to learn more about this proposal, show your legislators/candidates that Iowans care about conservation funding, and promote passing the needed legislation for this fund during Iowa’s 2009 legislative session.\n\nHow to pre-register & attend: Find the forum nearest you in the list below and then pre-register at http://conservation-candidate-… NOTE: Pre-registration is critical because individual events may be canceled if pre-registration numbers are low.\n\nOctober 14 at 7 pm in the Pin Oak Nature Center on HWY 14, south of Chariton.\n\nWednesday, October 15:\n\nThe final presidential debate will be on tv starting at 8 pm.\n\nFrom the Fairness Fund PAC:\n\nDo you want to elect leaders that promise change, equality, and genuine hope? This November we have a chance to send a Fair-minded Majority back to the State House to continue to fight for justice and fairness. Anti-gay groups and candidates are mobilizing for victory this fall – we must be ready to help our friends and allies. I hope you can join us to show your support for one of our friends and allies!\n\nPlease join us on Wednesday, October 15th, for a meet and greet with State Representative Candidate Gretchen Lawyer at the Mars Cafe (2318 University Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa), from 5:30-7:30pm. Gretchen will be there to answer questions about her vision for Iowa and what she plans to do when elected. Coffee will be served. There is a suggested donation of $30.\n\nGretchen Lawyer is running for State Representative in Iowa District 36. Gretchen Lawyer, a stay-at home-mother of two and a former teacher, is running for office because she believes we need the values of education, community, and hard work represented in the State Legislature, and that by working together we can put those values into action.\n\nPlease RSVP to Brad Clark at 515-783-5950.\n\nThursday, October 16:\n\nDead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico: Implications and Strategies for Iowa\n\nThis day-long conference begins at 8 a.m. at the Gateway Center in Ames, and will look at new and emerging research findings and pressing needs related to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.
