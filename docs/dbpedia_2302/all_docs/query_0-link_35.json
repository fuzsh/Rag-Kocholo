Loss ratios are explained as: the money auto insurance companies pay out in claims compared to the money they take in from premiums.\n\nFor example, an auto insurer collects $100,000 of premiums in a given year and pays out $55,000 in claims, the company’s loss ratio is 55 percent ($55,000 incurred losses/$100,000 earned premiums).\n\nCheck out the loss ratio for these two types of coverage in Iowa.\n\nLoss Ratio201320142015 Medical Payments (Med Pay) 67%69%79% Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist50%68%72%\n\nCompare RatesStart Now →\n\nYou may want to consider adding additional coverages or higher levels of coverage to your auto insurance policy, to avoid paying out of pocket in the event of an accident.
