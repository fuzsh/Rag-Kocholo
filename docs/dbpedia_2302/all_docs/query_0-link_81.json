        "text": "Truly a frontier town when it was founded in 1839, Iowa City was created to become the new capital of Iowa Territory.\n\nAuthor Tom Schulein has been researching and speaking widely on Iowa City history for over a decade. With the arrival of the railroad in 1855, growth was rapid, and is now known variously as an \"Athens of the West,\" a UNESCO City of Literature, and the \"Greatest Small City for the Arts.\"\n\nNamed by Algonkian-speaking Indians, Mississippi can be translated as \"Father of Waters.\" The river, the largest in North America, drains 31 states and 2 Canadian provinces, and runs 2,350 miles from its source to the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River is truly one of the great forces that has shaped the United States into the country it is today.\n\nAlthough its role has changed over the past few centuries, the Mississippi has always been important to those who lived along its banks. Indigenous peoples fished its waters and depended on the waterway for transportation. Explorers and traders traveled the river in hopes of conquering more land and obtaining wealth for their countries. Settlers moved close to take advantage of the rich farmland the river provided. All of these pursuits resulted in a trade industry that brought about a social and economic transformation, when news and goods made their way downriver and livelihoods were provided. In fact, the Mississippi River's economic and strategic value was so important that when Ulysses S. Grant won the siege of Vicksburg and control of the river during the Civil War, the Confederacy was dealt a serious blow. Today, although still used to transport goods, the river has taken on yet another identity: that of entertainer. Literature, pleasure boats, and floating casinos all showcase a new dimension of this magnificent river.\n\nOne hundred years ago, Cedar Rapids was nicknamed \"The Parlor City\" and \"Queen City,\" and was known for its massive grain processing plants. Today, Cedar Rapids is known not only for its agricultural products, but also for its communications industries ranging from radio to avionics manufacturing to telecommunications.\n\nCedar Rapids, Iowa focuses on the uniquely progressive heritage of the city, since its founding in 1842. The major institutions that made Cedar Rapids what it is today are included here in over 200 historic images from the collection of the History Center. Union Station, featured on the cover, was completed in 1897 and instantly became an impressive and fashionable gateway to the city. Other photographs look at the city's growth during the 1920s and '30s, when such structures as the Federal Building and Post Office, the Paramount Theatre, and the Art Center opened. This book focuses on Cedar Rapids from its early days as a \"Parlor City\" to its development of a \"modern city\" skyline in the late 1960s.\n\nAmes has been referred to as a railroad town; more correctly the railroad established itself at the same moment that Iowa Agricultural College, now Iowa State University, was taking form. While the railroad helped to develop Ames, it was the college that drew people with names like Welch, Beardshear, \"Tama Jim\" Wilson, Charles F. Curtiss, and their successors. The flourishing academic community also drew families like the Loughrans and the Tildens, who were attracted by the positive town-gown relationship.\n\nIn Ames: A Ride Through Town on the \"Dinkey,\" readers will meet some of these people and tour historic Ames, as the narrow-gauge train nicknamed the \"Dinkey\" weaves its way through the city's history in over 220 vintage photographs. The images in this book, featuring people and landmarks both past and present, include Ames native J. Herman Banning, the first African-American aviator to be licensed in the U.S.; the dramatic 1922 burning and destruction of the Iowa State College Armory; a rare image of the 1895 Iowa State football team, the first to be called the Cyclones; and finally, downtown Ames' growth from dirt streets with wooden sidewalks to a modern college town."
