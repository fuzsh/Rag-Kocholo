        "text": "“Great Friends, Great times and a Great Place to Call Home” More than a motto for Bethany Heights, this is our goal for every resident. If you are searching for a home for your loved one where they can live independently in a safe, friendly atmosphere, look no further! At Bethany Heights, we strive to provide an atmosphere of warmth, friendship and security where seniors can enjoy life to the fullest without the care of maintaining their residence on their own.\n\nBethany Heights offers residents social and recreational activities and trips for their enjoyment and enrichment. Many of the services that we offer residents are listed below. With many spacious, comfortable areas in the building, we provide an atmosphere comfortable for visiting with existing friends and family and for meeting new friends.\n\nBethany Heights was established eleven years ago by Bethany Lutheran Home, our parent company, and provides an important benefit to residents: access to rehab therapy or skilled care at our Medicare Certified nursing home located on the campus. We also have a staff member who lives on site and is available to assist with issues in the evening. We look forward to being of service to your family members."
