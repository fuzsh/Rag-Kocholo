        "text": "Highways\n\nBurma Shave\n\nClinton Odell, a Minneapolis insurance man was told by his doctor to find an occupation that required less energy. Mr. Odell and a chemist friend developed the brushless shaving cream that became known as Burma Shave. The word \"burma\" was chosen because that was where several of the ingredients came from. Mr. Odell and his sons started selling the product door to door but found that was a good way to starve to death fast.\n\nSon, Allan, convinced his father that a group of small roadside signs arranged in serial effect might be worth a try. In the fall of 1925, Alan and his younger brother, Leonard, installed several sets of homemade signs on a couple of highways leading to Minneapolis. Soon they began receiving repeat orders for the shaving creme.\n\nBurma Shave soon spread over the United States from coast to coast and amused generations of Americas. But by the late 1950s the magic was draining from the Burma Shave signs. Increased car speeds, broad super highways and the impossibility of reaching important urban and suburban markets with rural signs were all factors. The company went to TV advertising and gradually the signs were removed.\n\nHis face was smooth\n\nAnd cool as ice\n\nAnd oh Louise!\n\nHe smelled so nice\n\nThe answer to\n\na maiden's prayer\n\nis not a chin of stubby hair\n\nBeneath this stone\n\nlies Elmer Gush\n\ntickled to death\n\nby his shaving brush\n\n[Date and source unknown; submitted by Ann]\n\nC. B. Highways To Everywhere\n\nCouncil Bluffs has for its motto \"Council Bluffs, Railroads to Everywhere.\" It might well read, \"Council Bluffs, Highways to Everywhere.\"\n\nThere are fifteen highways that end in or pass through Council Bluffs. All pass over the strip of Broadway between Pearl and the Missouri River. Some are marked, some registered, some both, some neither, but all are recognized as roads laid out for marking if not already marked.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce has maps showing all of these roads, and can furnish information at any time on their condition. Every day the Nonpareil, beneath its weather report figures on page one, carries the Chamber of Commerce bulletin on road conditions.\n\nLincoln Highway.\n\nThe Lincoln Highway of course brings in most of the tourists. It traverses Broadway from end to end, and its markings appear on poles the entire length of the city's main street. It is not likely that Council Bluffs appreciates the worth of the big highway. Cities not on it would give a whole lot to be on the road named for the Great Emancipator. And it is fitting that this city should be located on this highway, for it was in Lincoln Park of this city, which now overlooks the road, that he stood and pointed the way to the west. The mark of this road is appropriate, a red and blue stripe above and below a white field on which appears a large \"L\" and \"Lincoln Highway\" in smaller letters.\n\nJefferson Highway.\n\nThe Jefferson Highway is several years younger than the Lincoln, but passes over the same street in Council Bluffs. None of its marks appear here, however. Coming up from the south, it is named for the third president, because it was during his administration that Lewis and Clark opened the great northwest, passing up the middle of the United States about the same route as the highway takes. And, what is interesting in connection with the fact that Council Bluffs is the place where the two great transcontinental highways cross, is that Council Bluffs got its name from councils here between Indians and the Lewis and Clark party. Some go as far as to claim that the council took place on the same bluff on which Lincoln half a century later stood and pointed out the path to the west, which Lewis and Clark had opened up. This is not verified, however. The sign of the highway is a \"JH\" monogram on a white field with blue hands.\n\nPioneer Trail.\n\nThe Pioneer Trail is perhaps next in historical interest, although but recently marked. It was almost along this identical road that the Mormons came to settle in Council Bluffs. An old Mormon grave yard is located in Old Macedonia on the trail on the east bank of the Nishnabotna River, while on the west bank is the place where the Mormons spent the winter before coming to Council Bluffs. The road also passes near the grove in Cass County where they spent some time, and where the descendants of some of the travelers still reside. The sign of the Pioneer Trail is the red Indian head on a white field. No association exists for this road, however. The marking was done on the initiative of Macedonia business men four years ago, cooperating with the Council Bluffs Chamber of Commerce. The road passes through Elliott and on down to Corning. It leaves Council Bluffs on South Avenue.\n\nCuster Battlefield Highway.\n\nThe Custer Battlefield Highway starts in Council Bluffs and goes out over Broadway, north to Sioux City, where it leaves the state to the northwest. This road was laid out but this spring, and no mark has been designated yet it touches the site of \"Custer's Last Stand,\" thus its name. This association puts out a little paper called the \"Custer Battlefield Hiway News,\" which is sent to all interested persons. E.H. Lougee of Council Bluffs and Dr. R.F. Sigafoos of Honey Creek are directors of the association.\n\nCouncil Bluffs and Shenandoah Short Line.\n\nThe Council Bluffs and Shenandoah Short Line follows out South avenue and goes along the same road as the Pioneer Trail until almost direct north of Silver City. Then it runs down through Silver City and joins the Blue Grass Trail near Malvern.\n\nO. K. Short Line.\n\nAlmost a sister road is the O.K. Short Line, which turns to the right off South Avenue, and passes through Glenwood and thence to Tabor. The marks of these two roads are identical, an \"O.K.\"\n\nBlue Grass Road.\n\nThe Blue Grass Road, which follows the same path as the O.K. out of Council Bluffs, but goes through Malvern, Hastings, Emerson, Red Oak and on east, has as its sign two white hands with one blue one between them. The first ten miles of this road is as pretty as could be found in the middle west. Hardly a half mile is straight, the roadway winding along and through the bluffs. The Missouri River lays like a silver ribbon to the west, and the bluff scenes vie with mountain places for beauty. Between the road and river lies the east immediate valley of the river, with thousands of acres of crops. The Chamber of Commerce until recently had pictures taken along this road which invariably were mistaken for western mountain scenes. The road passes over the bluffs between Council Bluffs and Glenwood, however, and enters the agricultural section which makes southwestern Iowa famous.\n\nI. O. A. State Line.\n\nThe I.O.A. State Line has for its mark vertical red and white lines, but they are fading out pretty much. The road turns off South Avenue at the Honey Creek bridge and passes out to the left of the I.S.D., going through Treynor, and Carson and thence east. This road plunges into the farm territory of the state within a few miles, and takes the tourist along some of the best kept places in the middle west.\n\nCouncil Bluffs, Sioux.City, And Spirit Lake Highway.\n\nThe Council Bluffs, Sioux City, and Spirit Lake Highway is not so well known here, because it is on the Lincoln Highway for fifty or sixty miles out of the city. But travelers to the lakes to the north -- and they are many among the fishers of Council Bluffs -- know it and its white and red stripes. Although as a general thing the east and west roads in Iowa are the best, this north and south road is in good condition most of the time.\n\nKing of Trails.\n\nThe King of Trails to an extent follows the path of the Jefferson Highway, and is considerably older. Its \"K.T.\" sign is familiar to north and south travelers, more so perhaps farther south than here, because of the number of roads in this part of the country which duplicate its route. It, like the Jefferson traverses Broadway, and is often taken by local people to Kansas or Missouri.\n\nOmaha, Denison and Spirit Lake Air Line.\n\nThe Omaha, Denison and Spirit Lake Air Line has no mark registered, but is well known to sportsmen and vacationists traveling to the north, nevertheless. It goes through this city over Broadway, and then to Denison and on north to the upper tier of counties where Iowa keeps her lakes and traveling summer shunners.\n\nD. L. D. Road\n\nThe D.L.D. road is a new one, which has absorbed the O.L.D., which ran from Omaha to Denver, and the River to River, which extended from Davenport to Council Bluffs. The new marks are being put on the poles by paint gangs now. The old \"R\" that appeared on a white field with black bands and told the tourist he was on the River to River Road, will be supplanted by a monogram of \"D.L.D.\", very similar to the \"O.L.D.\" of the road which, although starting officially in Omaha was marked in Council Bluffs to catch the convergence of Iowa's highways. The D.L.D. extends from Detroit to Denver. In Council Bluffs it traverses Broadway to Oak Street, then jumps up to Pierce and leaves the city on Canning.\n\nBotna Valley Road.\n\nAlmost identical with the new D.L.D. is the Botna Valley Road, except that it goes to the north through Shelby. It is not marked here, but officially comes into Council Bluffs. Its markings do not appear here.\n\nWhite Pole Road (aka Great White Way).\n\nThe White Pole Road or \"Great White Way\" is one of the easiest to follow of all, because of its mark. The pole simply is painted white for several feet. And out of Council Bluffs for many miles every pole is marked. Oakland, the first town east of the city on the route, cooperated with the local boosters, in putting on the extra markings. The Great White Way turns off Broadway at Oak and leaves the city over East Pierce and McPherson Avenue. It is very winding for a time, but after six or seven miles straightens out into a highway that gives some wonderful farm scenes.\n\nCorn Belt Route (aka Yellow Pole).\n\nThe Corn Belt Route, sometimes known as the Yellow Pole because of its markings, is less known, because not running so far. It leaves Council Bluffs over the same route as the White Pole, but branches off to pass through McClelland. It gets right up on the divide between Keg Creek and Mosquito Creek and lets the travelers see to the wonderful vineyards and orchards on the east side of the bluffs, while the other side presents a great panorama of grain and corn fields.\n\n[Nonpareil, Council Bluffs, Iowa, published July 24, 1920; submitted by Ann]"
