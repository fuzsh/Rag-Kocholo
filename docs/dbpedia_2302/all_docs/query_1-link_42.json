        "text": "The state motto of Iowa is, “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.” Not only can it be seen on the Iowa state flag, but it holds to our laws and the way our state is run. The motto clearly states that the liberties of the Iowa citizenry are valued and that they are willing to defend them. In the same way, current laws and law enforcement were created as a way to protect and maintain the peace of the public.\n\nThe Iowa Sex Offender Registry became law on July 1st of 1995 and is found in Chapter 692A Code of Iowa. The Registry is intended to serve as a deterrent and to protect the citizens of Iowa. Remember, always contact your local law enforcement officials immediately if you believe a crime has been or may be committed.\n\nThe Iowa code states;\n\n\"an individual who has been convicted or adjudicated of a criminal offense against a minor, sexual exploitation, or a sexually violent crime or who was on probation, parole, or work release status, or who was incarcerated on or after July 1, 1995 is required to register. Registration includes individuals who have received deferred sentences or deferred judgments, as well as those convicted of qualifying federal sex offenses or sex offenses from other states, U.S. territories or Indian tribal nations. The information on this website is provided by the Iowa Sex Offender Registry to the public pursuant to Iowa Code chapter 692A to aid in identifying and locating individuals who have committed an offense that requires registration on the Sex Offender Registry.\"\n\nAll information is available on this public website. The individuals found on this web page are considered absconders and are in a non-compliance status with local jurisdictions. Do not attempt to apprehend any of these offenders yourself. Report any information to DPS or your local law enforcement.\n\nOffenders are placed on Tier systems. Tier levels are based solely on the offense or offenses for which a person is currently registered. They are only used to establish how many times each year a registered sex offender is required to report in person to their Sheriff’s Office to verify registration information.\n\nTier I offenders are required to verify their information every year;\n\nTier II offenders are required to verify their information every six months;\n\nTier III offenders are required to verify their information every three months.\n\nA person’s tier level does not have an effect on whether the person is subject to the 2,000-foot law, how long they are required to register, or any other element of sex offender registration. It only determines how often the person must update their registration.
