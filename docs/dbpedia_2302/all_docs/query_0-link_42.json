Get help.\n\nDrug Trends\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration conducts a survey—National Survey on Drug Use and Health—that delivers national and state level statistics on the use of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs (including prescription drugs used nonmedically) and mental health in America. According to the most recent findings, Iowa residents use illicit drugs at a much lower rate than the United States average.\n\nWhen asked how many of them had used illicit drugs (including marijuana) in the previous month, 4.08 percent of adults responded that they had. That is nearly half of the national average, 8.02 percent. Moreover, when asked about illicit drugs (not including marijuana) the numbers decreased considerably. Less than 2 percent of Iowa residents reported using in the previous month, compared to a national average of 3.58 percent.\n\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to these low numbers. However, in no way do the numbers indicate that Iowa residents simply have stronger willpower than the average American. As drug addiction is a disease, it isn’t a failing of determination.\n\nBecause drug use trends indicate less drug use in Iowa than in the United States in general, it should be no surprise that deaths as a direct consequence of substance use should be lower than average as well. In 2007, 211 people in Iowa dies because of drug use. That is less than the number killed by auto accidents (459) and higher than the number killed by firearms (157). The national death rate for drug use is 12.7 deaths per 100,000 citizens. In Iowa, it is 7.1 percent per 100,000.\n\nTreatment Works\n\nData gathered in Iowa indicates that present treatment programs in place are producing positive outcomes.\n\nMethamphetamines use has been effectively reduced or stopped because of treatment. When data was gathered in 2003, 71.2 percent of clients in Iowa-based treatment for meth use remained abstinent for six months after leaving, and 75.4 percent of them were still abstinent at a year. In 2005, the following percentages of users were abstinent at six months after treatment’s end:\n\n65.4 percent of meth users\n\n49.3 percent of marijuana users\n\n47.1 percent of alcohol users\n\nTreatment has also been shown to help Iowans in recovery to stay out of jail. Information collected in 2003 shows that 90.4 percent of methamphetamine users had not been arrested during the six-month period after they left treatment, and 95.7 percent of those interviewed one year after treatment had not been arrested in the prior six-month period.\n\nTreatment Data The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration also collects data via a Treatment Episode Data Set. It shows the numbers for people admitted to treatment centers. In 2012, 27, 911 Iowans age 12 and older received drug and alcohol treatment in their state. Records show that 66.8 percent were men and 33.2 percent were women.\n\nBreakdown by Primary Substance at Admission\n\n7,121 alcohol only\n\n5,301 alcohol and secondary drug\n\n401 heroin\n\n1,306 other opiates\n\n469 smoked cocaine\n\n211 cocaine via other route\n\n8,116 marijuana\n\n4,380 methamphetamine and amphetamine\n\n124 tranquilizers\n\n45 sedatives\n\n129 hallucinogens\n\n9 PCP\n\n35 inhalants\n\n264 unspecified"
