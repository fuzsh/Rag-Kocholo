        "text": "Â p283Â The Bible\n\nAn Iowa Prayer\n\nYankees\n\nThe Foreign-Born\n\nIowa of the Old Adam\n\nÂ p285Â An Iowa Prayer\n\nJuly Fourth, 1888, on the occasion of the Celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Creation of the Territory of Iowa and of the One Hundred and Twelfth Anniversary of the Independence of the United States:\n\nOur Father, our Savior, our Helper! We thank Thee, as we gather to celebrate our early settlement and also the birthday of our national existence, that Thou art the God of all the nations on this broad earth. We thank Thee for the open Bible. We thank Thee for our country, [and] for the flag of our country, the one flag of a united nation. We thank Thee for our common schools and Christian colleges. We thank Thee for the removal of the disgrace and curse of slavery. We thank Thee for our beautiful home â river and forest and prairie. We thank Thee that the God of our fathers and defenders will continue to be our God; [so] that all Christian and moral, patriotic and decent men may be united against the one great remaining foe to our land, and even the world â the liquor traffic and habit. May the God who can turn the hearts of men, even as the rivers of water are turned, incline us to live to his honor and praise!\n\nÂ p286Â Yankees\n\nThey come! They come!\n\nThe opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal inÂ 1848 was opposed on divers grounds, but primarily 'because it would be the means of flooding the State with Yankees, who would be introduced by thousands'.\n\nBut if in the fifties the Yankees were coming, where were they? When inÂ 1854 Dubuque hotels were 'overflowing'; when at Burlington 'thirty thousand crossed the Mississippi' within ten weeks; when at Oskaloosa 'aÂ thousand passed every week'; when inÂ 1855 Fort DesÂ Moines suffered 'aÂ scarcity of women' so 'dreadful' that nineteen bachelors to one married couple might be found and when inÂ 1857 Sioux City sent forth a call for 'five hundred good-looking and industrious women' (no mere 'ladies' wanted) â where were the Yankees then?\n\nThe yearÂ 1850 saw fifty-five hundred pure bred Yankees in Iowa; the yearÂ 1856, eighteen thousand; and the yearÂ 1860, about twenty-five thousand.195\n\nWherever the Yankees had gone they had gone if possible in groups, church groups, groups carrying CongregationalismÂ â Â p287Â Congregational academy, college, and town. Progress for the Yankee in Iowa was not rapid. InÂ 1833 JuliusÂ A. Reed, a Mayflower descendant, and Aratus Kent of Yale preached at the Dubuque Mines. InÂ 1836 Asa Turner, of Massachusetts and Yale, preached at Fort Madison. InÂ 1838 Reuben Gaylord, of Connecticut and Yale, wrote regarding the future State of Iowa: 'Our object will be twofold â to preach the gospel, and to open a school at the outset, which can soon be elevated to the rank of a college'.\n\nInÂ 1843 there were in Iowa at least three hundred straight-out Congregationalists,​196 among them 'Iowa Band', eleven strong, with Father AldenÂ B. Robbins, Iowa's Puritan priest, and William Salter, Iowa's Puritan historian. 'It is calculated', said the NewÂ York Herald inÂ 1857, 'that about three hundred thousand will emigrate this season from NewÂ England. .Â .Â . The value of the property is estimated at twenty millions of dollars but taking the actual value of the settlers to the new States it will be at least thirty million more, making fifty to sixty millions of living value departing from NewÂ England to enrich the West'.\n\nThe value might be there, but early Iowa failed to perceive the fact. Product of 'Blue Laws', Yankees were 'Blue Bellies'! And, too, they were 'Black Abolitionists'! 'Congregationalism', sums up TrumanÂ A. Douglass, 'did not find congenial soil and atmosphere Â p288Â in early Iowa'. But if the Yankee in early Iowa was little welcome, either as Yankee or Congregationalist, there was a religious body that was more than welcome â the Methodists. Aided by 'friendly sinners' this body built in Ioway at Dubuque inÂ 1834 the first Protestant meeting house, true though it be that inÂ 1833 preaching in private dwellings at Dubuque had been inaugurated by the aggressive Presbyterian, Aratus Kent.197\n\nIn Iowa the Yankee staked all on book learning â book learning to the top notch. Copying his forbears, the founders of Harvard and Yale, he began educationally at the top and worked down. First he established his college; then he put beneath it a foundation. 'AÂ learned clergy!' This was the Congregational slogan. It was not the slogan of the Methodist.\n\nPeter Cartwright\n\nPrimate of all Prairiedom\n\nCartwright was a Virginian; aÂ shouting, praying, singing, Methodist preacher and Presiding Elder; bold yet with balance and a handy wit.​a 'Presbyterians', he wrote, 'and other Calvinistic branches of the Protestant Church used to contend for an educated ministry, for pews, for instrumental music, for a congregational or stated salaried minister. The Methodists universally opposed these ideas; and the illiterate Methodist Â p289Â preachers actually set the world on fire â the American world, at least â while they [the Calvinists] were lighting their matches!' He declared that if Bishop Asbury, the great pioneer of Methodism in the West, 'had waited for this choice literary band of preachers, infidelity would have swept these United States from one end to the other'.198\n\nIowa in the days of the Andover Puritan and of Peter Cartwright was not the place Puritan had thought to find. He had thought, writes one of the Iowa Band, to find a country with 'recollections of Christian homes fresh in their memories all eager to hear the gospel'. What was it that the Puritan did find?\n\nFreedom â aÂ freedom so large that it left him gasping. The Dubuque Visitor said inÂ 1836: 'AÂ man must be duller than the fat weed in Lethe's wharf if he does not feel the energy of his nature roused when he comes into the northwestern borders. .Â .Â . We who are pioneers have in our country newness, freshness, freedom, which never tire'. We found, said our brother of the Iowa Band, 'aÂ people starting homes, institutions, usages, laws, customs, in a new territory; gathered from all parts of the country and the world; coming together with different tastes, prejudices, ideas and plans; and representing all shades of belief and disbelief. Â p290Â Every phase of error, that any age or country had ever seen, was here cropping out'.199\n\nThe Infidel\n\n'Infidelity', writes an Andover Puritan, 'was presenting a bold front under the leader­ship of Abner Kneeland [of Massachusetts], first known in Vermont [New Hampshire] as a Universalist minister, afterwards in Boston as an Atheist [Pantheist]. He had settled with a band of his followers, male and female, upon the banks of the DesÂ Moines, to mould, if possible, the faith of the new settlers by \"substituting\", as one said, \"Paine's Age of Reason, for the family Bible, the dance for the prayer-meeting, and the holiday for the Sabbath.\"Â '\n\nKneeland had come to Iowa inÂ 1839 and had founded near Farmington (VanÂ Buren County) the town of 'Salubria'. The Theodore Parker of the West, Abner Kneeland was also its William Lloyd Garrison, WilliamÂ E. Channing, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and CharlesÂ W. Eliot. Lapsing from Universalism, Kneeland inÂ 1833 had said that he could not believe in a personal God. 'Everything', he said, 'is God. IÂ am a Pantheist'. Nor could he believe in Christ more than in the Greek Prometheus, nor in miracles, nor in the resurrection of the dead, nor in immortality â an attitude Â p291Â making him one with Iowa's red skinned modernist, Appanoose.\n\nWhen he founded Salubria, Kneeland was sixty-five years old. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and crowned with white hair. He had a wife and family, and his personal character was above reproach. In June,Â 1839, Kneeland wrote: 'IÂ have had but very few opportunities as yet, to disseminate any of my views in relation to theology, as IÂ advance them very cautiously: but whenever there is a chance without appearing intrusive IÂ do not shrink from what appears to be a duty â aÂ duty IÂ owe to my fellow beings'. And in August: 'IÂ had occasion to go Farmington yesterday; there seems to be some little movement there among religionists, such as prayer meetings, Sunday schools,Â etc., but IÂ think they will not amount to much'.200\n\nTo purge Iowa of Kneelandism was scarcely for the sons of Andover. It was a forthright, Cartwright, job. Exhortation, warning, prayer, tears, song; to be 'mighty in prayer' and a 'sweet singer in Israel' ('Jesus Lover of my Soul', 'Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me')' 'to know the Bible as one knew one's own name' â these were the requirements. In one of those northern trips [1834 orÂ 1835]', says Peter Cartwright, 'IÂ was earnestly solicited to cross the Mississippi and preach to the few new settlers near what is now called Burlington Â p292Â City, on the west of the father of waters'. Not a cabin of the whole settlement would hold the people. From a sapling pulpit in a grove he declared 'the unsearchable riches of the Gospel of Jesus Christ'.201\n\nFists\n\nCongregationalist and Methodist in early Iowa were at enmity â 'friendly' enmity. Of Congregationalists, Peter Cartwright said: 'IÂ had never seen a Yankee and IÂ had heard dismal stories about them. It was said they lived almost entirely on pumpkins, molasses, fat meat, and bohea tea; moreover that they could not bear loud and zealous sermons and they had brought on their learned preachers with them and they read their sermons'.\n\nLong years agone, writes Hawkins Taylor inÂ 1870, 'a methodist preacher by the name of Cartwright [Barton Cartwright], living aÂ few miles west of Burlington, traveled the circuit of what is now DesÂ Moines, Lee, and VanÂ Buren counties, never missing an appointment. From West Point to Keosauqua there was nothing but a trail. .Â .Â . John Points [near West Point] was known as the bully of his section. .Â .Â . At that time there was a man by the name of Allan [living not far away]. Allan was from Maine, and prided himself on being a Yankee â an article scarce at that time in that section. Allan had heard of Points as Â p293Â the bully of West Point. Points was a Kentuckian. Allan sent him word that he would meet him in West Point on a certain Saturday; that he was from Maine, and that he believed a Maine man could whip any Kentuckian. With the Saturday Allan and Points met, for the first time. Their friends formed a ring, and the two men went to work. Points had ten friends to Allan's one, but no one said a word; perfect fair play was observed, until Allan said he was whipped. It was a rough and tumble fight, and never were two men more evenly matched, and seldom better men. The fight was long and desperate; both were a mangled mess when through'.\n\nAt the end of the fight both men were arrested. 'Each one pleaded that the fight was merely in fun; no harm whatever was intended; that it was merely to test the fighting qualities of Maine and Kentucky. Allan was very eloquent that Points, at least, should not be fined, as he was the victor'.​202 In early Iowa Congregationalists and Methodists were at 'friendly' enmity.\n\nBook Learning\n\nFrom the Top Down\n\nEducation in early Iowa was the higher education: it was of 'Bible' inception and built from the top down. It was rather markedly Congregational, and as such Â p294Â long lived. The oldest academy of this denomination was Denmark Academy​203 established inÂ 1843, opened inÂ 1845; and the oldest college was Iowa College, opened inÂ 1848 at Davenport and afterwards transferred to Grinnell, there to expand under President GeorgeÂ F. Magoun.\n\nNot that in Iowa the Congregationalists monopolized higher education. Even the Methodists began early to establish academies and colleges: Iowa Wesleyan University, 1842 (openedÂ 1844); Iowa City College, 1843 (openedÂ 1846); Cornell College (Mt.Â Vernon), 1853; Upper Iowa University (Fayette), 1857; Simpson College (Indianola), 1867; Morningside College (Sioux City), 1894.\n\nColleges, too, were established by the Presbyterians, five in number (one of them Coe College), 1851â1891; by the Baptists, three, 1852â1865; by the Disciples of Christ, one, 1855; by the United Brethren, one, 1856; by the Friends (Quakers), two, 1868â1873; by the Lutherans, two, 1868â1903; by the Catholics, two, 1843â1873.\n\nThese academies and colleges, these institutions generated at the top, did they serve their end? They were instruments of culture, and owing to them, or to colleges like them outside Iowa, there was a surprising culture in pioneer Iowa towns. Iowa's first governor, Â p295Â Robert Lucas, said after a tour of the Territory inÂ 1838: 'IÂ had supposed her population was the same as generally found in frontier settlements â hospitable, yet rude; but in this IÂ am most agreeably disappointed'. It is the conclusion of James Bryce that 'the multiplication of small institutions in the West with uncontrolled freedom of teaching has done a work which aÂ few state-regulated Universities might have failed to do'.204\n\nAt all events the Iowa of the eighteen fifties, the Iowa of the towns, was well sprinkled with men of academic training. Miami University (near Cincinnati) alone contributed to Iowa in one yearÂ (1858) graduates as follows: RalphÂ P. Lowe (Governor), of Muscatine and Iowa City; J.Â B.Â Howell, P.Â D.Â Foster, S.Â T.Â Marshal, Rev.Â W.Â M.Â Boyce, of Keokuk; Jacob Butler, C.Â Foster, GeorgeÂ S.Â Rea, of Muscatine, J.Â W.Â McDill, B.Â J.Â Hall, W.Â Wright, of Burlington; WilsonÂ C. Hollyday, of West Point; JaredÂ M. Stone, of Iowa City; J.Â B.Â Coombs, of Washington; R.Â T.Â Drake, of DesÂ Moines; SamuelÂ C. Kerr, of Sigourney; O.Â Newman, of Sioux City; and Joel Tuttle, of Keosauqua.\n\nFrom the Bottom Up\n\nMeanwhile the conditions of education in Iowa at the bottom (the conditions of secular education) were far from good. InÂ 1843 Governor John Chambers expressed Â p296Â chagrin at the 'little interest the important subject of education excites among us'. InÂ 1847 JamesÂ W. Grimes noted with disgust that no provision had been made by the First General Assembly of the State for building schoolhouses by law, nor for the support of primary education by taxes.\n\nThen (1856â1858), with Grimes as Governor, and Horace Mann as mentor, improvement set in. Yet, as late asÂ 1887 Iowa's Superintendent of Public Instruction pointed out 'the striking similarity of conditions educationally between Iowa and the Southern States'. And as late asÂ 1896 the National Commissioner of Education, Dr.Â W.Â T.Â Harris, 'showed that the schedule of salaries for teachers for Iowa was the lowest of all the north central States'. Later stillÂ (1902) the president of the State Teachers' Association felt warranted in saying in his inaugural: 'IÂ believe that three-fourths of the teaching of the rural schools of Iowa is absolutely worthless .Â .Â . it is the experience of every man and woman here'.​205 This, despite the fact that inÂ 1870 Iowa showed the least illiteracy of any of the States.\n\nNor is the foregoing the whole story. In Iowa untilÂ 1880 the State University was fed meagrely and from hand to mouth. 'IÂ don't understand', writes a pioneer Iowa lawmaker, 'the reasons for such an attitude of constant hostility and bush-whacking opposition to Â p297Â forward movements'.​206 As for the State Teachers College at Cedar Falls, it was not untilÂ 1886 under President HomerÂ H. Seerley that it began to assume a place outstanding.\n\nAÂ State Agricultural College was sanctioned by the Iowa General Assembly inÂ 1858, and inÂ 1859 the trustees held a meeting on proposals relative to the location of the institution. Declaration, however, was made (evidently with a side glance at the Old Stone Capitol building in Iowa City where the State University was housed) that in the case of the Agricultural structure, there should be 'no costly dome, or curious winding stairs'. AÂ good, respectable looking building was desired, 'good enough for the farmers of our State, and good enough for anybody else'.\n\nThe first Iowa school for ends distinctively secular was one conducted inÂ 1830 on the Half-Breed Tract. This was the first school in Iowa. It was housed in a room supplied by Isaac Galland and was taught by Berryman Jennings of Warsaw, Illinois.​207 ByÂ 1840 there were in Iowa 63Â primary and common schools with 1500Â pupils. InÂ 1846 the 20,000Â pupils of school age then in the State had at disposal 400Â school districts and 100Â schoolhouses. In the movement for common schools fittingly housed, Burlington and Dubuque were prominent as early asÂ 1850; but no community made a better showing than Muscatine. Said Â p298Â the Jackson County Press inÂ 1853: 'This enterprising city has now completed and occupies another large and splendid edifice for public school purpose costing aboutÂ $8000'. About the same time the Chicago Advertiser said: 'Her [Muscatine's] public schools are a credit to any city. Two of her school buildings are in no way inferior to those in Chicago'.\n\nStill, as late asÂ 1868, nearly one-third of Iowa's 373,000 school population was not registered in any public institution. InÂ 1868 Iowa had at least ninety-four private and denominational schools with 5800Â students working largely 'from the top down' â to say nothing of fifty-five 'academies and colleges'. As ClarenceÂ R. Aurner reminds us, the public school was distrusted on its 'moral' side. In the public mind as late as the eighteen seventies, and even later, morality was closely associated with the religion, with the Bible. This, despite the contention by the board of education in Dubuque that 'the Free Public School can be governed and pervaded by moral ennobling influences'. InÂ 1858 Judge Charles Mason, Iowa's veteran jurist (then a member of the State Board of Education), was in favor of making the Bible 'aÂ standing text-book in every school', and to this the Board so far assented as to forbid the exclusion of the Bible from the schools. The next year the State Teachers' Association declared that 'the Bible should be read daily in the public schools'.208\n\nÂ p299Â The Foreign-Born\n\nThe late eighteen forties and early fifties brought into Iowa (largely in Biblical groups) the foreign-born. In the proportion of such to native Americans, however, Iowa inÂ 1850 ranked below Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\n\nAmong the foreigners who came were Hollanders â rebels against ecclesiasticism. The men were 'broad-shouldered' and 'in velvet jackets'; the women 'fair-faced' and 'inÂ caps'. Pella (spes nostra et refugium)​b was their destination. 'But, Dominie, where is Pella?' 'We are in the midst of it', was the reply. 'But the dominie's little daughter, Johanna, like the little girl in the fairy story of Hans Christian Andersen, could not see anything at all. She thought to herself, \"This Pella is all a make-believe\".'209\n\nThen, too, there came to Iowa Germans of whom many were artists and teachers. To Davenport came a musician who had been an intimate friend of Wagner; an artist who had been professor in one of the largest art schools in Germany; men and women of dramatic training.​210 Davenport Germans presented plays of MoliÃ¨re, Shakespeare, Schiller. 'Farewell, my Fatherland, farewell!' sang the Davenport Maennerchor Â p300Â (1851) in strophes rendered in English by the versatile and (later) eminent JohnÂ F. Dillon:\n\nLiberal Aristocrats\n\nInÂ 1849â1850 Iowa welcomed from Hungary, under Count UjhÃ¡zy, a small group of the followers of Louis Kossuth. They founded NewÂ Buda in Decatur County. Kossuth himself was to have come, but did not. 'The residence of the Governor of the colony and of Kossuth', says the DesÂ Moines Valley Whig inÂ 1851, 'is a log cabin fifty feet in length, twenty feet in width, the interior divided into three compartments for kitchen, dining room, and bed room. AÂ modern cook stove stands near the fire place; kitchen utensils are on shelves. There are two beds, the snowy white of the linen contrasting with the vivid hues of their oriental coverings. AÂ table stands near the window, covered with books and documents. AÂ portrait of Washington is conspicuous'.211\n\nCitizen Cabet\n\nThen there was Ãtienne Cabet of France, enthusiast for democracy, the equality whereof must, he insisted, Â p301Â extend to property. Was not Jesus himself an Equalitarian? At Nauvoo Cabet purchased of the Mormons their recently vacated lands and buildings. His colony, called 'Icaria', was a Utopia, a Plato's Republic. Purity of morals, sweetness in philosophy, sublimity in faith â such were the outlines. 'We are Christians', announced Cabet, 'the Gospel is our law'. Life was to palpitate with joy. There was to be music by instrument and voice, the theatre, dancing, and public games. Nauvoo (in Illinois) was merely provisional. Iowa was to be ultimate â Iowa on the Nodaway in Adams County where there had been secured three thousand acres of land. And hither came the Icarians. InÂ 1853 Count UjhÃ¡zy, bidding Iowa adieu, acclaimed the incoming Icarians: 'As all true principles of liberty had their source in heart and spirit of France, it is most natural that social reforms should be begun by the same nation. .Â .Â . If IÂ could have two native lands IÂ should wish that Hungary be the first and France the second. .Â .Â . My best wishes will always be for the success of your colony'.212\n\nPeasants\n\nBut already the influence of Cabet was sending toward Iowa men, other than Frenchmen, who sought freedom. AÂ book by Cabet, The Voyage and Adventures of Lord Causdal in Icaria, reached a group of Â p302Â Biblical Germans â 'The Community of True Inspiration' â and to find Icaria they set forth inÂ 1842. They came to NewÂ York, and laterÂ (1855) to Iowa. There in Iowa County they bought land â 18,000Â acres. They laid out a village â an Icaria â not gay; not a place of music, of dancing, of the theatre; but a place of Teutonic austerity. Amana they called it â 'Keep the Faith'.213\n\nMonks of LaÂ Trappe\n\nGloria patri, filii, et spiritus sancti\n\nThe followers of Kossuth quitted Iowa as the followers of Cabet entered it; but the French under Cabet had themselves been forestalled by other Frenchmen. Already there had settled near Dubuque a band of monks from an ancient Norman foundation â LaÂ Trappe. Their devoirs were three: Abstinence, Silence, Labor.\n\nDriven from France by illiberality, the brotherhood inÂ 1848 sought America. InÂ 1849 Bishop Loras of Dubuque offered them land near that city. AÂ building of medieval Gothic â white stone walls, arched windows, buttresses and spires â crowning a hill backed by trees and green fields. Such toâday is the Iowa monastery of LaÂ Trappe.​214 Amana and LaÂ Trappe! 'AÂ number of former Catholics', we read, 'have subscribed to the faith' of the Inspirationists of Â p303Â Amana â even a Catholic priest 'wearied with the pomp and ceremony of the Church of Rome'. LaÂ Trappe at Dubuque permits to its voiceless votaries the inspiration of the eye: 'cloistered avenues', gardens aflame with salvia, roses, and peonies. Amana permits to votaries a German garden: old-fashioned fourÂ o'clocks, lady slippers, marigolds, and geraniums.\n\nSt.Â Donatus of Old Luxemburg\n\nAmong Catholic institutions near Dubuque, aside from LaÂ Trappe, St.Â Donatus greets us â chapel and seminary. Long has it rested in the little valley of TÃªtes desÂ Morts. Thirteen priests it has supplied to the Catholic Church, and sixty-three sisters for the veil. It treasures a relic from the skeleton of good Donatus himself (dead over aÂ thousand years). From the chapel there ascends to a Golgotha a winding way marked by altar stations of the Cross.215\n\nThe Revival\n\nBut, recurring to religionists in early Iowa who were native Americans, the Methodists and the Baptists led. They gave to the Commonwealth the 'camp meeting' and the 'revival'.\n\n'Upon the right bank of the DesÂ Moines river. .Â .Â . above the mouth of Chequest creek', says a pioneer ofÂ 1837, 'there was selected our \"first temple\", since Â p304Â known as \"The old church tree\". .Â .Â . This first service was .Â .Â . widely heralded and largely attended. There were perhaps aÂ hundred people, including many Indians' â the latter on the edges of the crowd with blankets over their shoulders. 'IÂ seldom pass that elm tree to this day', observes our pioneer, 'but that IÂ unconsciously look at its roots as IÂ did that day at Mr.Â Hill's [the preacher's] direction when he screamed: \"Oh sinner, Look! Look! (bending with hands nearly to the ground) while IÂ take off the hatch of hell!\" .Â .Â . He did this after so arranging matters that IÂ was sure young people in general, and I, in particular, were but aÂ few inches above the rotten ridge pole of the burning pit. What a relief when he quit'.\n\nBilly Sunday, Iowa revivalist, Fairfield,Â Iowa, 1907: 'My God, my friend, if the Lord would only draw back the veil which is between you and your coffin, you would leap back in horror to find it so near that you could reach out and touch it'.\n\nIn his account of the revival under the tree our pioneer ofÂ 1837 relates that beneath this tree, 'in citizen's clothes and with great stove pipe hat', he last saw Black Hawk. The old chief lay asleep, but what made the sight of him noteworthy was the hat.216\n\nÂ p305Â The Methodists and the Baptists gave to early Iowa the camp meeting and the revival, but in things secular the Methodists took precedence. To them Iowa was indebted for James Harlan (United States Senator), Hiram Price (Congressman), GeorgeÂ G. Wright (Supreme Court Judge and United States Senator), JamesÂ B. Weaver (Congressman), WilliamÂ E. Miller (Supreme Court Judge), C.Â F.Â Clarkson (Editor), and John Mahin (Editor).\n\nAs between Iowa Methodist (an Emory Miller, for example) and Iowa Congregationalist a point is to be noted: the Methodist, a 'Gospel Ranger', sped here, sped there; the Congregationalist, Puritan in fixity, took stand once and forever. GeorgeÂ R. Rice officiated at Council Bluffs for sixty years; William Salter at Burlington for over fifty years; AldenÂ B. Robbins at Muscatine for fifty years; EdwinÂ S. Hill at Atlantic for forty years; Ephraim Adams at Decorah and Waterloo for thirty years. As, at the close of life, each pastor of the Iowa Band laid down his task, he passed, so it is said, to the brother next in age his staff â emblem, like the torch of the Greek, of a course unfalteringly run.217\n\nBiblical at the outset, education in Iowa continues in a degree still Biblical. Toâday the Catholic, the Quaker, the Hollander, the Lutheran, seeks to keep Â p306Â the training of youth under denominational control; and this, in the case of the Hollander and the Lutheran, to the extent of fostering the use of the Dutch and German tongues.\n\nShrines in early Iowa were denominational. But one there was that was undenominational â Amity College in Page County. Here early Iowa had one altar to the Unknown God.\n\nPeter Cartwright and the Congregational Deacon\n\n(As told by Cartwright himself)\n\nÂ p308Â Iowa of the Old Adam\n\nCongregationalists (the Iowa Band) and Methodists (followers of Peter and the other Cartwrights) made Iowa Biblical by displa­cing or suppressing the disciples of Abner Kneeland. Later, the Episcopalians ('proud of ancestry and privilege') took part in evangelization. Iowa's first Protestant Episcopal BishopÂ (1854) was Henry Washington Lee,Â D.Â D., of Rochester, NewÂ York. The names of certain counties of Iowa, if read from south to north are 'Lee', 'Henry', 'Washington'. 'Dr.Â Lee', exclaimed a fellow churchman on the former's consecration, 'must go to Iowa â his name Henry Washington Lee is inscribed in the soil of the State'. As for Iowa's second Episcopal Bishop, Rev.Â William Stevens Perry of Providence, Rhode Island â he was consecrated inÂ 1876.\n\nOne July Fourth, Bishop Perry, by request of the Dean and Chapter of St.Â Paul's Cathedral, London, preached in the cathedral an 'American sermon'. The Bishop, as he himself relates, met on this occasion the Prince of Wales (EdwardÂ VII) and members of the Prince's family. The Prince observed that his family were not church goers. Whereupon one the Princesses interjected, with some humor, that when she Â p309Â heard that the 'Bishop of Iowa' was to preach, she resolved to attend from the thought that the Bishop of Iowa must, of course, be a 'Red Indian'.\n\nIt was before the day of either of the Bishops named that Iowa (in spots) became recklessly an Iowa of the Old Adam.\n\nGeorge Davenport â Banditti â Edward Bonney\n\n(AÂ Life Beyond)\n\nColonel George Davenport was known as a 'good pal'. He liked company. Withal he liked song. Company he was wont to bring to his house on the island of Rock Island from the town of Davenport across the Mississippi. To this town inÂ 1842 there came from Cincinnati a relative of Davenport's â aÂ young woman eighteen years old. Rose was her name, and she had a captivating voice. Often she sang for the Colonel and his household. Furthermore, she belonged in Davenport to a famous church choir (St.Â Anthony's) and her voice, sustained by flute, violin, and cello, was at times borne to the Colonel from the Iowa shore. On the island of Rochester Island in the eighteen forties George Davenport led a contented life.\n\nOn JulyÂ 4, 1845, seated in his arm chair in the front room of his house, with his family absent at a celebration of the day, Colonel Davenport heard a noise Â p310Â in a back room. He opened the door between and was confronted by three men, one of whom shot him through the thigh. The gang seized him, threw him down, bound and blindfolded him, and extorted a disclosure of the whereabouts of his money. They then left their victim covered with blood to die. The treasure obtained was $400 in notes, a five franc piece, a gold watch and chain, a gun, and a pistol.\n\nAt the time of the Davenport murder, who should be living in Iowa (at Montrose) but Edward Bonney â aÂ man who had just brought to the noose two robbers who were also murderers. To Bonney the Davenport case was referred. Bonney in aÂ few months was able to fasten guilt (with penalty of hanging) upon six men â Baxter, Fox, Birch, Young, and John and Aaron Long. The activities of the six were horse theft, counterfeiting, house robbery, and as incidental to the latter, murder. Of the four sorts of crime in which the murderers of George Davenport specialized, horse theft was the chief. House robbing yielded disappointment; the sums 'raised' fell much below expectation. It was so in the Davenport case.218\n\nPlaces in Iowa favored by horse thieves were dells and gorges along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and inland from the former stream on the Cedar-Iowa and the DesÂ Moines. On the Mississippi such a place there was in Jackson County â the 'Big Woods'. To Â p311Â Bellevue in Jackson County inÂ 1837 had come a party from Michigan. They drove good teams and were led by WilliamÂ W. Brown, a man of striking physique and engaging manners. Withal, Brown's wife was a woman handsome, accomplished, and above all, kind and helpful. Brown set himself to hotel keeping and to cutting wood and selling it to steamboats. He employed a score or more of men.\n\nSoon after Brown's coming to Bellevue, counterfeit money began to appear thereabouts and horses and cattle to disappear. Brown became a justice of the peace. When any of his men were charged with horse or cattle theft (as they were) Brown befriended them. He provided alibis. Of interest to Iowans is the fact, developed by Bonney, that the men guilty of the murder of George Davenport (three of them at least) had been retainers of Brown's in his operations in and around Bellevue.219\n\nBuried Treasure\n\nWilliam Fox alone of the gang tracked by Bonney saved his 'earnings'. Iowa was his bank â aÂ spot of Mother Earth in the bluffs along the lower DesÂ Moines. Had the Davenport murder yielded $30,000 or more, it was his purpose to retire with his share to normal life.\n\nBanditti pelf! Buried treasure! Bonney himself felt Â p312Â the lure. 'IÂ was also anxious', he says, 'to get some clue to Fox's money on the DesÂ Moines River in Iowa, feeling confident that the money of which Col.Â Davenport was robbed was concealed with it'. 'Fix, John [Long] andÂ I', said Birch to Bonney, 'travelled on [after the murder] until within one or two miles of the DesÂ Moines River, when we stopped at a farmhouse. .Â .Â . Here John purchased some bees-wax .Â .Â . we left the main road, passed down a ravine .Â .Â . stopped, and made preparation to conceal the money and watch. They told me to take the bees-wax and lay it on a rock to warm in the sun. AÂ portion of the paper money .Â .Â . was put into a glass bottle. .Â .Â . This bottle, containing some eight or nine hundred dollars [not all of it from Davenport], was sealed over with bees-wax, and buried near that place, together with about two hundred dollars in silver tied up in a cloth. Davenport's watch was also inclosed in bees-wax to prevent injury from wet, and buried with the money. .Â .Â . Fox passed on a short distance up the bluff, and buried it'.\n\n'AÂ few hours', says Bonney, 'before the execution of the Longs and Young [they were hanged at Rock Island], John Long informed a friend of Baxter's, that when Fox buried the money in the bluff on the DesÂ Moines River, he made certain landmarks by which he or his friends could find the money'. Immediately Â p313Â after the execution, Bonney started in search of the money. 'IÂ found the marks', he says. 'The fallen leaves from the forest trees had covered the ground, obliterating every mark where the earth had been removed, but after a close search IÂ found where the robbers had deposited their treasure, and found three American half dollars, and two Spanish quarters, with other marks which proved that the money had been dug up and removed in the night, doubtless under the direction of Fox, after his escape' â for escape he did.220\n\nAÂ Life Beyond\n\nGeorge Davenport had been murdered and white men would avenge him. But there remained a duty to be performed by the Fox Indians, a band of whom had gathered about Fort Armstrong. There must be assured to the dead man a life beyond.\n\nAt the head of Davenport's grave, which was near the Davenport dwelling, the Foxes placed a white cedar post. This they now (on JulyÂ 25th) embellished by brush and paint with headless human figures â symbols of Sioux killed by them in war. Fox braves, bearing each a war club, then paced rhythmically three times around the grave in direction opposite the course of the Sun. At each revolution the braves voiced a fervent prayer gesticulating toward the Sun and toward Â p314Â the northeast â the direction of the Mississippi River Sioux. It was implored of the Sun that he open to the departed the Sun portals. It was demanded of the Sioux that they attend the departed in the Sunset and be forever his bondmen there.221\n\nThe Author's Notes:\n\n195 F.Â I.Â Herriott's Did Emigrants from NewÂ England First Settle Iowa? p47.\n\nSo great inÂ 1855 was the craze for lands in Iowa, by Yankee and other immigrants, that inÂ 1856 fear began to be felt that the supply might not hold out. Iowa boasted aÂ hundred counties, but there might be need of more. Twice was Congress memorialized. Leet 'the northern boundary of Iowa be extended westward to the Missouri River'. So spake the memorials. Had they been heeded, nine counties would have been added to Iowa â nine counties of the present South Dakota â and again would Iowa have been Iowaland.\n\n196 TrumanÂ O.

Under the tutelage of H.Â S. and J.Â E.Â Perkins of Boston, they founded at Iowa City the 'Iowa State Normal Academy of Music'. The Academy presented with great credit not only such composition as Mozart's Twelfth Mass (chorus of some seventy-five voices), but also Haydn's Creation and Mendelssohn's Elijah, the latter for the first time west of Chicago.

Rev.Â Ebenezer Alden of Tipton, Iowa, one of the Band, preached at Marshfield (where, having taken the 'back trail', he had become Congregational pastor) Webster's funeral sermon. He was not the only Iowa clergyman to preach a funeral sermon for Daniel Webster. In Muscatine, another 'Alden', a member of the Band, the Rev.Â AldenÂ B.
