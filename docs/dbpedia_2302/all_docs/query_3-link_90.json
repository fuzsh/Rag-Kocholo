        "text": "In today’s market, it’s important that you work with the very best to represent your interests. When representing buyers, our motto is “price is what you pay and the value is what you get.” To achieve this you will need someone with thorough knowledge of the market. As a seller you need someone with experience, expertise, and an aggressive marketing plan with great negotiating skills to get the best price for you.\n\nMy training for this business started at a young age. While watching my parents in their real estate careers I was practically born into this business. With such a solid foundation for the fundamentals of real estate, it’s one of my life passions. The more I learn about real estate the more I want to learn. I’ve turned into a student of the real estate masters. I not only constantly read books on the subject; I attend educational classes and national seminars. I believe competence builds confidence and I’m confident that you will receive the very best in real estate counsel and service when working with me.\n\nI also understand that it’s my job to keep the excitement for home buying from turning into frustration and pain. Many buyers want to get in and go. This is the quickest path to buyer burnout. In my experience it’s always better to slow down and take a deep breath, we need to first recognize your wants and needs. Then identify and show you the properties that fit your criteria.\n\nFrom local moves to cross country relocations, I have the knowledge and experience for your next real estate transaction. My real estate system means that you have a group of specialists dedicated to creating the smoothest, most hassle free, real estate purchase possible. So, what is the difference between a traditional real estate agent and my system? It is service; we have the ability to provide a higher level of service to our clients, as well as offer some services that other real estate agents can’t, such as the use of a free moving van and so much more."
