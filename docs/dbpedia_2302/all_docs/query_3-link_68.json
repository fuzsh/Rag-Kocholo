        "text": "Practices start on Monday, August 19th\n\nNEW LOCATION: 20595 McPerson Ave. | Council Bluffs, IA\n\nPreseason Schedule:\n\nEntry Level: Monday & Wednesday 5:30-6:30 PM, & Sunday 3:00-4:00 PM\n\nLevel 1: Monday & Thursday 5:30-7:00 PM, & Saturday 9:00-10:30 AM\n\nLevel 2: Monday & Thursday 7:00-8:30 PM, Wednesday 6:30-8:30 PM, & Saturday 9:00-10:30\n\nGirls ONLY practice: Sunday 4:00-5:00 PM. Coach Massey wanted to offer this to the girls of all levels.\n\nEntry Level (Beginners): This group includes all 5/6-year-olds and 1st/2nd year wrestlers. We consider this group as the foundation of our program, and we believe that the structural change will significantly improve their experience. We will prioritize teaching the basics of wrestling and ensuring a FUN atmosphere for these young athletes. Additionally, we will adopt a more hands-on approach with parents, offering guidance on tournament readiness and frequency. At this level, we believe that practice is far more beneficial than competition. Coach Massey will provide input on when a wrestler is ready to move up to Level 1.\n\nLevel 1 (Intermediate): This group comprises wrestlers aged 7 and above with at least 3 years of wrestling experience, including those who have graduated from Entry Level. Level 1 is the most diverse group in our program. As they transition from FUN to FOCUS, practices will become longer and more intense, instilling a strong work ethic and commitment to improvement. We will emphasize attitude and effort during every session. Competition schedules will increase, along with the level of competition. Just like in Entry Level, we will maintain open communication with parents regarding tournaments. Coach Massey will provide input on when a wrestler is ready to move up to Level 2. Some Level 1 wrestlers may also practice with Level 2 from time to time.\n\nLevel 2 (Advanced): Reserved for all athletes 7th grade and above, including those who have graduated from Level 1. Level 2 is the pinnacle of our club and comprises the highest-level wrestlers. Practices will be intense, with a focus on advanced techniques and a relentless pursuit of excellence. We expect exemplary attitude and effort at every workout. This level is where wrestlers prepare for High School and beyond. To achieve this, Level 2 will have increased practice length and frequency. Wrestlers at this level will also be encouraged to travel and compete at the Regional & National level.\n\nGirls Sunday ONLY (All Levles) This is for girls of all levels and ages. If you select this during registration you are only allowed to practice on Sundays. If you select one of the levels above, you get thoe practice times along with Sundays"
