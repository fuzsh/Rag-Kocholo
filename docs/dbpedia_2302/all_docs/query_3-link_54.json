Our review scores prioritize reviews that are recent — the past 24 months — because we know families need current information when choosing senior care.\n\nThose with many recent, positive reviews receive a high review score, while providers with few recent reviews — regardless of how positive — receive a lower review score. Communities with no recent reviews will not have a review score, even if older reviews are positive. The maximum A Place for Mom review score a community can receive is 10 points."
