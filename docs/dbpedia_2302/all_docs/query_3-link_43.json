        "text": "Rich Bartholomew, longtime coach and father of three active kids brought the idea for COBRA to Alan Byers, C.B. Fire Chief and Ed Kermoade, a teacher and coach at Wilson Jr. High. The first meeting of COBRA volunteers was held in Nov. of 1997 and brought together several pro-active youth sports and community leaders including Mark Brooks, Randy Smith, and Marty Brooks. At this meeting the foundation, goals, and mission of COBRA started taking shape based on the original concept that \"every child should have the opportunity to play regardless of the cost.\" Upon receiving non-profit status, COBRA was on its way. An initial family membership fee of $5 registered kids of grades 3-8 into COBRA. Each child and parent is responsible to participate in fundraisers and community service projects throughout the year. The current cost is $15 annual family participation fee and includes sports programs all year long. Teams were put together with coaches from our original 50 kids and put in various leagues throughout the city. COBRA pays for fees, uniform and equipment costs. The number of COBRA participants has continued to grow over the years to our current 250. In the fall of 2005 COBRA proudly joined âOptimist Internationalâ and changed our name to the COBRA Optimist Club of Council Bluffs. We are the same great club and even more dedicated to fulfilling our mission. Our motto has always been and always will be, \"For the Kids\"\n\nImportant Cobra Information\n\nRegistration Agreement\n\nAGREEMENT: I hereby certify that the child listed above is in normal health and able to participate in the COBRA Optimists (hereinafter \"Sponsor\") Youth program. I assume all risk(s) and hazards incidental to the program and for the transportation to and from the program unless otherwise provided for by the specific program. I hereby indemnify and hold \"Sponsor\" harmless from all claims, damages, liabilities (including attorney's fees and legal expenses), causes of actions, actions, suits and other legal proceedings in any matter relating to or arising out of the child's participation in this program. I hereby authorize \"Sponsor\" to seek medical aid in the event that parents or guardians cannot be reached in case of emergency. I understand that \"Sponsor\" is not responsible for my child past program times.\n\nCOBRA Mission\n\nThe mission of the Council Bluffs Recreation Association is to provide affordable athletic opportunities to the children of Council Bluffs. COBRA will promote parental involvement, and foster community service and civic pride through participation in local charitable and civic endeavors. Opportunities will be offered to children regardless of economic background and athletic ability. We believe that any child wishing to play should not be left on the sidelines because of finances.\n\nFinancial Information\n\nA combination of participation fees, fundraising and donations from individuals, businesses and civic organizations provide the funding for COBRA to operate. Our fundraising throughout the years has featured a golf tournament, jump rope-a-thon, raffles, street dances, basketball tournament, and more. The generous support of local businesses and area schools also make it possible for us to continue to grow. COBRA is registered in the state of Iowa as a non-profit organization and is proud to announce our chartered membership of Optimist International."
