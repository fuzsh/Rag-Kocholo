Baruch told the committee: \"These measures, put into effect promptly, can boost production sufficiently to cover the whole Marshall plan and still break the present inflationary cycle almost immediately, cancel part of the national debt, while laying the groundwork for orderly tax reduction in the future.\" Baruch sided with President Truman in the dispute which is developing between the administration and some republican congressional leaders over how the Marshall aid program should be administered. He said congress should give \"full operating powers to a single, competent administrator\" who would be subject to the president and secretary of state on matters affecting foreign policy. That is the administration plan .\n\nSome republicans have suggested an agency, directed by a eight-member board, to handle the program. Taft (R- Ohio) has suggested creation of a new cabinet post to handle it.
