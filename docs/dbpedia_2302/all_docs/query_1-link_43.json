        "text": "Wednesday, July 1, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nIn the morning, Brigham Young and other members of the Twelve rode up the bluffs to John Taylors camp on Mosquito Creek, where they met together with Captain James Allen and his men from Fort Leavenworth. Captain Allen presented a letter of introduction from President William Huntington at Mount Pisgah. He also showed the brethren a letter from Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, authorizing Captain Allen to recruit Mormons for a battalion to march toward Santa Fe. The decision had already been made by the brethren the previous evening to support the government and raise the battalion.\n\nAt 10:40 a.m., the council called the men in the camp to assemble. They gathered around a wagon used as a stand. President Young introduced Captain Allen, who then addressed the people. He explained that his mission, authorized by the President of the United States, was to enlist five hundred Mormon men into a battalion to help take California in the Mexican War. He wanted the men to be ready to leave in ten days. If he could not get five hundred men, he did not want any. He read his orders and passed out copies of a circular which had also been passed out at Mount Pisgah.\n\nPresident Brigham Young next addressed the assembly. The men were very anxious to know the feelings of the brethren on this matter. President Young explained that this call to service was something that he had been hoping for and that it would bring about much good. He probably explained about Jesse C. Littles mission to Washington D.C. to enlist support from the government.\n\nThere were very bitter feelings in the hearts of the men toward the government for past injustices. But President Young tried to help them make a distinction between the general government and those in public positions who oppressed the Saints in Missouri and Illinois. The government in general should not be blamed for acts perpetrated by the mob. He said, The question might be asked, is it prudent for us to enlist to defend our country? If we answer in the affirmative, all are ready to go. . . . If we embrace this offer we will have the United States to back us and have an opportunity of showing our loyalty and fight for the country that we expect to have for our homes.\n\nPresident Young next issued the call to raise the Mormon Battalion: Now I want you men to go and all that can go, young or married. I will see that their families are taken care of; they shall go on as far as mine, and fare the same, and if they wish it, they shall go to Grand Island first.\n\nCaptain Allen stated that he would write to President Polk and ask that permission be granted to let the rest of the camp stay in Indian Territory while the Battalion was away.\n\nElder Heber C. Kimball formally proposed that the five hundred men be raised as asked by the government. The motion was unanimously supported by the brethren. President Young immediately rose from his seat and said, Come brethren, let us volunteer. Elder Willard Richards started to take down names of volunteers.\n\nThe men in the camp were still hesitant. Henry W. Bigler wrote:\n\nIt was against my feelings, and against the feeling of my brethren although we were willing to obey counsel believing all things would work for the best in the end. Still it looked hard when we called to mind the mobbings and drivings, the killing of our leaders, the burning of our homes and forcing us to leave the States and Uncle Sam take no notice of it and then to call on us to help fight his battles.\n\nLater, members of the Twelve met in John Taylors tent to work out some of the details with Captain Allen. There were good feelings in the meeting. Brigham Young proposed that he and Heber C. Kimball should travel to Mount Pisgah to raise volunteers. He understood the urgency to raise the Battalion. President Young wished to have the rest of the camp settle on Grand Island for the winter while the Twelve would travel further west with their families.\n\nIn the afternoon Brigham Young and the others returned to their camp near the river. Some of Brigham Youngs teams had already been sent across the river. President Young asked the Twelve to delay crossing over the river for the present time.\n\nPatty Sessions recorded in her diary:\n\nThe boat [ferry] is done, ready to cross. The word is for us to be ready to go to the river at 10 o'clock. When 10 o'clock came the word was, put the teams to the wagons and start in 10 minutes. Before that time was up the men were called to a public council. One of the troops have come in to enlist men for one year to go to California. The Twelve had a private council after and Brigham is going back to Mt. Pisgah and sent word to us to stay where we were if we chose.\n\nLorenzo Dow Young arrived back from his trading expedition to Missouri. He found the rest of his family well and they were glad to see him.\n\nA son, Mason Lyman Tanner, was born to Sidney and Louisa Tanner.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, Iowa:\n\nAt 6 a.m., Parley P. Pratt, traveling back to Mount Pisgah, met William Claytons company. Later in the morning, Wilford Woodruff traveled a few miles and was also met by Elder Pratt, on his way to raise a company of pioneers to go over the mountains. Elder Pratt of course had no idea that the plans and changed and that now a battalion would be raised. He delivered his message to Elder Woodruffs camp of fifty wagons. Elder Woodruff traveled twenty miles this day. William Clayton traveled seventeen miles and remained a few miles ahead.\n\nFurther to the west, near the Indian village, Hosea Stout and a large company returned to work on a bridge. A new foreman was selected and they decided to build a drift bridge. This bridge would be a large raft which was to be built on top of the old bridge that had mostly been washed away. Many wagons were backed up at this point, waiting for the bridge. Hosea Stout wrote, Our encampment now was very large. The hills were full of our tents & waggons and seemed to be nearly as large as the first camp when it started in February [at Sugar Creek].\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nSister Mary Richards spent the morning unpacking her chest to let things air out, and spent the rest of the day packing for her planned departure on the following morning. She had been at Mount Pisgah since June 12.\n\nIn the afternoon, Parley P. Pratt arrived and called for a meeting at 5:30 p.m. He informed Ezra T. Benson that he had been called to serve in the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, taking the place of John E. Page. Isaac Morley was being sent to take Elder Bensons place in the presidency of Mount Pisgah. Elder Benson wrote:\n\nBro. Parley P. Pratt came down from the Bluffs with a line from President Brigham Young, directed to me, stating I was appointed one of the Twelve Apostles to take the crown of John E. Page, and if I accepted of this office, I was to repair immediately to Council Bluffs and prepare to go to the Rocky Mountains. A brother offered to take my family to the Bluffs with his own team, and not owning a horse at this time, I went to see Bro. Ross to buy one. He said he had none to sell, but said if I was called to be on of the Twelve Apostles he would give me one, and he turned out to be his best riding horse.\n\nThe meeting was held and Elder Pratt called for a company of five hundred pioneers to travel without their families over the mountains.\n\nBonaparte, Iowa:\n\nFar to the east, on the Des Moines River, a daughter, Mary Coltrin was born to Zebedee and Mary Coltrin.\n\nSandwich Islands (Hawaii):\n\nThe Brooklyn raised anchor and again started to sail for California. The Orrin Smith family was left behind because of illness. As they sailed, it soon discovered that they had a stowaway. The stowaway was a young lad from the U.S. Army.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 203‑207; John Taylors Journal; Extracts from the Journal of Henry W.

This meeting was to further inform the Saints about the Mormon Battalion and the leaders asked able men to step forward and enroll. John Taylor recorded in his journal that he had hard feelings against the government. However, he felt that the raising of the Mormon Battalion would give them a legal right to go to California.\n\nCaptain James Allen worked to secure the formal permission of the Pottawatomie Indians for the Saints to settle on their lands. The agreement read:\n\nWe the undersigned chiefs and braves representing the Pottawattomie tribe of Indians near this subagency do voluntarily consent that as many of the Mormon people now in or to come into our country as may wish from cause or necessity or convenience to make our lands a stopping place on their present emigration to California may so stop, remain and make cultivation and improvement upon any part of our lands not now cultivated or appropriated by ourselves, so long as we remain in the possession of our present country, or so long as they shall not give positive annoyance to our people.\n\nBrigham Young ate dinner with Patty Sessions. He instructed her company to move down to Council Point, so they all started preparing to make the move. Brother Freeman came to get Patty Sessions to deliver his wifes baby. She went back three miles to Parley P. Pratts camp and helped deliver a baby girl into the Freeman family.\n\nBrigham Young finished taking his teams across the Missouri River on the ferry. A camp was established about four miles to the west at Cold Spring. Lorenzo Dow Young also started taking his teams over. When he learned that his brother, Brigham, was making another trip with the ferry, he paid those running the ferry extra money so that he could also finish taking his teams over. He wrote, I went over and got back about half after ten, tired almost to death. I actually felt as if I had not strength enough left to undress myself. Went to bed and rested as well as I could, for the mosquitoes.\n\nHeber C. Kimball and Willard Richards moved their camps further away from the river on the east bank, and dug a ten-foot well, finding plenty of good water. Elder Kimballs daughter, Helen Mar Kimball Whitney wrote:\n\nMosquitoes were so troublesome near the river that we were obliged to move back, and as we were far from water, the brethren dug a well close by. As it was nearly dusk when they concluded to move from the river, and being very weary, I, with one or two others accepted an invitation from the Chiefs daughter to accompany her home; and when returning, finding the wagons gone and not feeling strong, she urged me to return and stop over night, which invitation I accepted though I spent a somewhat nervous and wakeful night.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, Iowa:\n\nWith the bridge finished, Hosea Stout attempted to cross it. There was a great rush to get across because everyone was afraid that the poorly constructed bridge would not last. Brother Stout made it across and then reached the next stream a mile further where another new bridge had just been finished. He wrote:\n\nThere was large companies of Indians followed us today for several miles and in fact they thronged around us all the time we were building the bridge & at times would come in droves to the camp but they were very civil, friendly & good‑natured and done none of us any injury while we were here. They would amuse themselves sometime by swimming in the creek in large numbers and sometimes at playing cards at which they seemed to be very dexterous. They appeared to be much interested at our operations while at work which seemed to be a great novelty to them.\n\nBrother Stout moved on about 18 miles and camped in the prairie just after crossing a small, deep stream.\n\nWilliam Clayton lost his horses during the night. He searched for them four miles to the east but could not find them. He went back to his camp and later found them a mile to the west. His camp moved out about 10 a.m., passed through the Indian village at sundown, and camped at the Nishnabotna River where the new bridge had been built.\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nIn the morning, Parley P. Pratt and Ezra T. Benson started for Council Bluffs. Sarah Rich wrote that at about this time the brethren in the settlement found that they needed to stake and rider the fences in order to secure their crops from the cattle. She explained, Now I expect that many of my readers will not know what stake and rider fences mean, for they do not see much of that kind of work in this day. They put stakes cross ways on each end of their poles, and then laid another pole on top of the old fence, which made the fence some higher than it was so the cattle would not jump over the fence.\n\nPhinehas Richards also departed with his family in one wagon. They had originally planned to stay at Mount Pisgah longer, but Phinehas brother, Elder Willard Richards, asked them to move ahead to Council Bluffs. They traveled about eight miles on good roads and in pleasant weather.\n\nTo the west, on the Oregon Trail, Nebraska:\n\nThe Mississippi Company of Saints neared the North Fork of Platte River. During the night someone came into the camp and cut loose several of the Saints horses. By morning, three were missing. During the morning, the Saints met a company from California who told them the distressing news that there were no Mormons on the route ahead of them. All this time, the Mississippi Company thought they were behind the main body of the Saints. They now understood the truth, which caused much dissatisfaction in the camp. Some wanted to turn back, but they decided to press on to Fort Laramie.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois\n\nFranklin D. Richards and his brother Samuel W. Richards were preparing to leave for their mission to England. At the temple, Thomas Bullock pronounced a blessing on some important packages that would be taken by these brethren to the east and to England.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 207; The Instructor, May 1945, 217; Womans Exponent, 13:135, 150; Nibley, Exodus to Greatness, 195; William Claytons Journal, 52; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 173; Diary of Lorenzo Dow Young, Utah Historical Quarterly, 14:144; John Taylor Journal, typescript BYU; Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church 3:143; Thomas Bullock Journal, BYU Studies 31:1:74; Sarah Rich Autobiography, typescript BYU, 58; John Brown Journal, Our Pioneer Heritage, 2:426; Louisa Pratt autobiography, Heart Throbs of the West 8:241; Ward, ed., Winter Quarters, 67; Patty Sessions Diary in Our Pioneer Heritage, 2:61\n\nFriday, July 3, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nHelen Mar Kimball Whitney had spent the night with the Chiefs daughter. In the morning they both went out to pick blackberries and other wild fruit in the woods. Helen was impressed by her new friend.\n\nI learned that her parents had separated, as her mother was now living with her and did most of the work. Though dressed in her native costume she looked neat and kept the house tidy, and could cook equal to white women. . . . Later she showed her taste and skill in braiding my hair in broad plaits, after the latest French style, and put it up a la mode! In the evening she accompanied me to the Camp.\n\nMany of the men were busy moving their wagons across the river. Lorenzo Dow Young got up very early and worked hard, driving teams up the bluffs on the west side of the river. Charles Decker soon arrived across the river with four yoke of oxen to help Brother Young. With an additional yoke of oxen, they hauled wagons up the hill. They could only haul up one wagon at a time. At one point, one of the oxen panicked and tipped over a wagon which contained some children. Luckily, the children were not hurt. They made several more trips with the help of Jedediah M. Grant and camped near a small creek at Cold Spring.\n\nBrigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards started toward Mount Pisgah at 9 a.m. to raise men for the Mormon Battalion. They rode in President Youngs carriage while other men in the party rode on horseback. At 1 p.m., they stopped at the Mosquito Creek camp and had dinner with George A. Smith, Orson Pratt, and Orson Hyde. At 5 p.m., they passed several companies traveling to Council Bluffs, numbering 180 wagons. After a thirty-four-mile journey, they camped with Ebenezer Brown and John I. Barnard. The brethren talked with the men in the camp about enlisting into the Battalion until midnight.\n\nZadoc Judd was among those who heard President Youngs message to enlist. He wrote that they made\n\na request that all who could possibly be spared should enlist as soldiers in the government service to serve as such for the term of one year. This was quite a hard pill to swallow‑‑to leave wives and children on the wild prairie, destitute and almost helpless, having nothing to rely on only the kindness of neighbors, and go to fight the battles of a government that had allowed some of its citizens to drive us from our homes, but the word came from the right source and seemed to bring the spirit of conviction of its truth with it and there was quite a number of our company volunteered, myself and brother among them.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, Iowa:\n\nWilliam Claytons company started early and traveled four miles before breakfast. As they traveled, they met Brigham Youngs company and learned about their mission to recruit the Mormon Battalion. It was their belief that raising the battalion would help the Church, and if the call to service was rejected, it would bring more persecution upon the Church. After they parted, William Clayton traveled a total of twenty‑five miles, camping near Hiram Clark.\n\nFurther to the east, after traveling twelve miles, Hosea Stouts oxen could go no further because of exhaustion. The other brethren he was traveling with wanted to go on and did. Brother Stout was totally out of food and pleaded with them to leave some with him for his family but they did not. Brother Stout found a nice camp by a beautiful spring and soon other companies joined him there. A man named Henry Nebeker, who was not a member of the church, let Brother Stout get milk from his cows and gave him a piece of bacon, and ten pounds of flour. By night there were many companies at the campsite. Shortly after dark, members of the camp saw a carriage and some horsemen coming from the west and feared that the U.S. officers might be returning. They soon found out it was Brigham Young and his company. President Young only stopped for a few minutes to talk with Hosea Stout. He explained about the mission to raise recruits for the Mormon Battalion at Mount Pisgah and Garden Grove. Brother Stout wrote, Their presence seemed to give new life to all the camp who flocked around them and asking so many questions that they could not answer any of them. But after a few words of comfort to us they went on.\n\nStill further to the east, as Wilford Woodruff was traveling toward Council Bluffs, he was overtaken by Parley P. Pratt and Ezra T. Benson. These brethren wanted Elder Woodruff to return with them immediately to Council Bluffs. Elder Pratt was still following his mission to raise a company of pioneers and then to quickly return to Council Bluffs. Elder Woodruff decided to join them, so he saddled his horse and off they went. He commented that he had an interesting time once more with Br. Parley. And to add to the interest of the days ride, we passed through the main village of the Pottawatomie Indians the first time I ever passed through a large village of Indians in my life. They continued riding until dark and made their beds in the grass on the side of a hill. Soon the mosquitoes attacked them and they moved to the top of the hill where the wind was blowing.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nFranklin D. Richards and Samuel W. Richards boarded a steam boat, leaving Nauvoo for their mission to England.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 207; William Claytons Journal, 52, 53; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:56; Diary of Lorenzo Dow Young, Utah Historical Quarterly, 14:144; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 173‑74; Womans Exponent, 13:135; Zadoc Judd Autobiography, BYU, 21;\n\nSaturday, July 4, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nWilliam Clayton finally reached the camp at Council Bluffs. He was delayed for much of the day, searching for horses and trying to find food for his hungry family. He attended a council meeting at Captain Allens tent.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, Iowa:\n\nHosea Stout continued his journey to Council Bluffs slowly because his teams were so weak. The weather was hot and muggy. He only traveled about six miles, reaching Keg Creek, where there was a small grove. Here his oxen gave out again. After a rest in the afternoon, he continued on for three more miles and camped on the prairie.\n\nFurther to the east, and heading in the opposite direction, Brigham Young was in his carriage ready to go at 8 a.m., when Elders Parley P. Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, and Ezra T. Benson met him. Elder Woodruff had not seen President Young for almost two years, as he had been away serving as the president of the British Mission. He wrote, It was truly a happy meeting. I rejoiced to once more strike hands with those noble men.\n\nElder Parley P. Pratt reported that he had raised a company of eighty-four pioneers for the mountains. President Young informed them about the new plans to raise the Mormon Battalion.\n\nAt 9 a.m., Parley P. Pratt continued his journey toward Council Bluffs. Since there was no longer an urgency for Elders Woodruff and Benson to reach Council Bluffs, they joined Brigham Youngs group, traveling back to Mount Pisgah where they would retrieve their families. After they had traveled twenty miles, they found Elder Woodruffs company. Brigham Young met Elder Woodruffs seventy-year-old father, Aphek Woodruff, for the first time. Wilford Woodruff stayed with his family then resumed his journey toward Council Bluffs. He rode fifty miles on this day and was very sore, stiff, and sick.\n\nAt about a half hour before sunset, Brigham Youngs group passed through Pottawatomie Indian Village, pressed on for eight more miles, and spent the night in Isaac Morleys camp. They counted 206 wagons during the day.\n\nAt 10:30 p.m., President Young retired for the night in Father Morleys tent. It soon began to thunder, lightning and rain. He had to crawl into a wagon to avoid getting too wet. Many tents in the area blew down during this hard downpour of rain.\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nA wedding party was held with dancing and music, with a thunderstorm to wind up the celebration.\n\nPutnam County, on the border of Iowa and Missouri:\n\nA Mr. L. Marshall wrote a letter to the President of the United States, There is a set of men denominating themselves Mormons hovering on our frontier, well armed, justly considered, as depredating on our property, and in our opinion, British emissaries, intending by insidious means to accomplish diabolical purposes. He asked for an armed force to be sent to expel them from our border.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nAlmon W. Babbitt, one of the Nauvoo Trustees, took William Law on a tour through the temple. Brother Babbitt had been a longtime friend of Laws, who was one of the missionaries that introduced Brother Babbitt to the Gospel. This temple tour did not please many members of the Church still in Nauvoo. Thomas Bullock wrote, Many persons expressed their dissent of the act and well do I remember Josephs words, If it were not for Brutus, Caesar might have lived. So has Law proved a Brutus unto Joseph. William Law had published the Nauvoo Expositor which was a catalyst to the martyrdom of the Prophet.\n\nMartha Haven wrote to her mother in Sutton Massachusetts: We think soon of going to Farmington, Iowa. We shall probably stay there till fall. Her husband, Jesse, talks of boxing our things ready for the wilderness. . . . We have sold our place for a trifle to a Baptist minister. All we got was a cow and two pairs of steers, worth about sixty dollars in trade.\n\nPacific Ocean:\n\nThe Saints on the Brooklyn recognized Independence Day. Samuel Brannan brought out the cloth that he obtained at Honolulu and had the women make it into uniforms for the men. Each man had a military cap and there were fifty Allen revolvers available. Brother Brannan then drilled the men with the help of Samuel Ladd, an ex‑soldier, and Robert Smith, another passenger who understood military tactics.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 208‑9; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 174; Diary of Lorenzo Dow Young, Utah Historical Quarterly, 14:144; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:57; Thomas Bullock Journal, BYU Studies, 31:1:74; Cook, William Law, 117; The Ship Brooklyn, Our Pioneer Heritage 3:490; Louisa Pratt Autobiography, Heart Throbs of the West, 8:240; Golder, The March of the Mormon Battalion, 96; Holzaphel, Women of Nauvoo, 173\n\nSunday, July 5, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nThe weather was extremely hot and muggy. Lorenzo Dow Young wrote, It seems as if we could not live. Hosea Stout finally arrived at Council Bluffs. He searched and found Elder Orson Hyde who was the presiding Church official at the camp. Elder Hyde recognized Brother Stouts destitute condition and invited him to stay near his camp, which was on a ridge. Brother Stout pitched his tent and prepared for what he expected would be a long stay. In the evening he took his wife to be reunited with her mother. He wrote, Our feeling on meeting was very tender without a word being said we all burst into tears in remembrance of the loss of my little son Hosea.\n\nHosea Stout then went to see U.S. Captain James Allen, who was on another ridge situated under an artificial bowery near his tents with several men in attendance having the Striped Star Spangled Banner floating above them. He was a plain non-assuming man without that proud over bearing strut and self conceited dignity which some call an officer‑like appearance. They had a pleasant conversation about the battles that had occurred recently on the Rio Grande River.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, Iowa:\n\nDuring the night, a White Hawk Chief named Oquakee came and camped near Brigham Young and his company. They were hungry so President Young asked a brother to give the Indians a fat cow. Brigham Young promised them another cow when they returned to Council Bluffs. The Indians, were of course, very pleased.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m., Brigham Youngs company resumed their journey toward Mount Pisgah. At 11:30 a.m., they stopped when they came upon a number of brethren. Brigham Young preached and continued recruiting for the battalion, but he sensed that it had little effect. He reproved Andrew H. Perkins for harboring a wrong spirit in his company, to which Brother Perkins responded to with gratitude.\n\nSamuel H. Rogers reflected on reasons to join the Battalion, It was like a ram caught in a thicket and that it would be better to sacrifice the ram than to have Isaac die. Reflecting upon the subject, it came to my mind that Isaac, in the figure, represented the church . . . and for the saving of its life I was willing to go on this expedition.\n\nAt this location was the Phinehas Richards company, including Mary Richards. President Young asked Mary Richards if her husband, Samuel W. Richards, had left Nauvoo for his mission to England. She told him that she believed that he had. President Young was pleased. He asked her if it had been hard to part with him and how she was doing. She responded: [I] told him it was hard and I stood it the best I could being satisfied that I had to endure it. I did the best I know how. Elder Kimball also remarked that he was pleased that Samuel W. Richards had gone on the mission and said that he was a good boy. Mary wrote: [They] told me to be a good girl and it would only be a little while before I should meet him on the other side of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nWillard Richards, Samuels uncle, also visited with Mary Richards and the rest of the family. He mentioned that if Samuel W. Richards and Franklin D. Richards had not left for their missions, they would have been asked to join the Mormon Battalion. A third brother, Joseph, was being counseled to join the battalion as a drummer. Mary shared with Willard Richards her trials and asked for a blessing. He replied, You have got your hearts desire and there is every blessing in the world for you and what do you ask more? He gave them some good instruction and had to leave them at 4 p.m.\n\nBrigham Youngs company continued their journey. During the day they counted 240 wagons.\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nJesse C. Little arrived at the settlement on his way to deliver the news regarding the battalion from President Polk to Brigham Young. Certainly he discovered that Captain Allen had already been to Mount Pisgah on this mission. He went to the wagon of Louisa Pratt and delivered to her some money from her husband, Addison Pratt, who was serving a mission in the South Pacific.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nMeetings were held in the temple. Almon Babbitt spoke in the morning and Joseph Young spoke in the afternoon. He spoke against abusing wives, children, and animals. Erastus Snow left Nauvoo for his trip back to join his family whom he had left at Garden Grove. Brother Snow had earlier returned to Nauvoo to try to sell his property. He did so, for about one fourth the real property value. On this day he crossed the Mississippi with his brothers William and Willard Snow.\n\nA daughter, Barbara Young Crockett, was born to David and Lydia Crockett.\n\nCalifornia:\n\nWith the aid of American settlers in the vicinity of Yerba Buena (San Francisco) Colonel John C. Fremont defeated the Mexicans recently in two battles. On this day, the American Californians declared themselves independent, and placed Fremont as their leader.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 209; Samuel H.

He described it as an Indian village which consisted of some scattering houses and was mixed up with French & half breeds. All not amounting to many. This was where they kept their trading houses & large business no doubt is carried on.\n\nAt the river crossing, many were moving their wagons over to the other side. It was hard work and very slow going. George Miller crossed over with thirty-two wagons. He was going 114 miles west Pawnee Village, a Presbyterian mission station which was recently raided by Sioux Indians. His mission was to go to the village, salvage any possessions, and bring them back to Bellevue, which was across the river from Traders Point.\n\nHosea Stout went for a visit across the river. The hill is uncommonly steep on the other side. The landing was at the mouth of a deep ravine up which it was now contemplated to make a road as it would not then be a very steep hill to assend. He went with Orson Pratt, George A. Smith, and others to find a good route for the proposed road. It would be very difficult to make because the area was heavily timbered and there were very many ravines.\n\nOn his way home, Hosea Stout met George W. Harris. They had a long talk and Brother Harris advised him to enlist in the Mormon Battalion. Brother Stout wrote, I then returned home again as I went not yet knowing what to do.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, Iowa:\n\nWilford Woodruff continued his journey toward Council Bluffs. An Indian chief and some squaws camped nearby that evening. The chief said that he was going to meet with Mormons and smoke the pipe of peace.\n\nNear Mount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nBrigham Young and his company arose very early, at 4 a.m., and were on the road by 4:30. They stopped for breakfast at Ezra Chases camp. Eleven miles outside of Mount Pisgah, they met Charles C. Rich and Jesse C. Little, who joined their company. As they passed Daniel Russells camp, they blessed his sick wife. In the evening they reached Mount Pisgah. During the day they passed 241 wagons, including 63 that were camping across the river from Mount Pisgah. They had counted a total of 800 wagons and carriages between Council Bluffs and Mount Pisgah. Brigham Young spent the night at President William Huntingtons house.\n\nChimney Rock, Nebraska:\n\nThe Mississippi company of Saints came to Chimney Rock. They stopped at Horse Creek and repaired wagons.\n\nVoree, Wisconsin:\n\nJames J. Strang, who claimed to be Joseph Smiths true successor, was proclaimed imperial primate. John C. Bennett, a former counselor to Joseph Smith, was named Strangs general‑in‑chief.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 209‑10; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 175; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:57; William Claytons Journal, 53; Hartley, My Best for the Kingdom, 210; Van Noord, King of Beaver Island, 49; John Brown Journal, Our Pioneer Heritage, 2:426\n\nTuesday, July 7, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nHosea Stout was looking for a way to get food for his family. He did not want to resort to begging, so he went down Mosquito Creek to the sawmill and tried to find work. There was not any there and his health was getting so poor that no one would have hired him anyway after taking a look at him.\n\nThomas L. Kane, the new influential non-Mormon friend, arrived at Council Bluffs from Fort Leavenworth. Henry G. Boyle wrote,\n\nWhile I was waiting at Colonel Sarpys [trading post at Traders Point] for the Battalion to be organized and mustered into service, a stranger (Colonel Kane) arrived at the Point and obtained board and lodging at the same place. After gaining an introduction to me, he soon entered into an animated conversation relative to our people, their history, religion, etc. I found him to be a very pleasant and affable gentleman, and very easy and fluent in conversation.\n\nBrother Boyle was at first cautious but Kane soon presented a letter of recommendation from Jesse C. Little. I soon found that his sympathies and good feelings were all in our favor.\n\nThomas L. Kane later wrote about his first impressions of Council Bluffs:\n\nThey were collected a little distance above the Pottawatomie Agency. The hills of the high prairie crowding in upon the river at this point, and overhanging it, appear of an unusual and commanding elevation. . . . This landing, and the large flat or bottom on the east side of the river, were crowded with covered carts and wagons; and each one of the Council Bluff hills opposite was crowded with its own great camp, gay with bright canvas and alive with the busy stir of swarming occupants. In the clear blue morning air the smoke streamed up from more than a thousand cooking fires. . . . From a single point I counted four thousand head of cattle in view at one time. As I approached the camps, it seemed to me that the children there were to prove still more numerous. Along a little creek I had to cross were women in greater force . . . washing and rinsing all manner of white muslins, red flannels and parti‑colored calicoes, and hanging them to bleach upon a greater area of grass and bushes than we can display in Washington Square.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nThe day was very hot. Wilford Woodruff described, Our cattle came near melting. He moved his camp within twelve miles of Council Bluffs.\n\nPhinehas Richards company was several miles behind. Mary Richards wrote, Having no wood, we started before breakfast, went 1 mile, found wood & stopped to take refreshments, after which we proceeded. Crossed several bad slews and hard hills. The weather being very hot, we rested from 11 till 3. Met about 40 Indians.\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nAt 10 a.m., Brigham Young dictated a letter to be sent to the Samuel Bent, the president of the settlement at Garden Grove. He sent him an advance message about the need for volunteers for the Mormon Battalion. He explained that the battalion would march to Fort Leavenworth to receive their arms, ammunition and other provisions. He emphasized,\n\nThis is no hoax. Elder Little, President of the New England churches, is here also, direct from Washington, who has been to see the President on the subject of emigrating the Saints to the western coast, and confirms all that Capt. Allen has stated to us. The U.S. want our friendship, the President wants to do us good, and secure our confidence. The outfit of these five hundred men costs us nothing, and their pay will be sufficient to take their families over the mountains.\n\nThe recruits were to be between age eighteen to forty‑five. They were to immediately go to Council Bluffs. Drummers and fifers were wanted. The rest of the Saints would be gathering on Grand Island in the Platte River, about 120 miles to the west of the Missouri River, where there was a salt spring which would be of use to make salt. He anticipated that before spring, they would be able to bring all of the Saints to Grand Island, even the poor.\n\nBrigham Young and Heber C. Kimball conducted a meeting to raise the Mormon Battalion. Heber C. Kimball said, If you leave your wives, your wives shall be taken care of . . . and if any of you die, why die away and the work will go on. I suppose that many think that you are going to starve to death. But I will tell you [that you] will never want. You will have abundance and to spare. Jesse C. Little also spoke.\n\nSixty‑six men volunteered. Eighteen-year-old James S. Brown, was one of those who stepped forward. He had not as yet been baptized, but was so moved by the speaking of Brigham Young that he went to Grand River and was baptized. He wrote in his memoirs:\n\nThis done [my baptism], the happiest feeling of my life came over me. I thought I would to God that all the inhabitants of the earth could experience what I had done as a witness of the Gospel. It seemed to me that, if they could see and feel as I did, the whole of humankind would join with us in one grand brotherhood. . . . Elder [Ezra T.] Benson said the Spirits promptings to me [to enlist] were right. . . . He told me to go on, saying I would be blessed, my father would find no fault with me, his business would not suffer, and I would never be sorry for the action I had taken or for my enlistment. Every word he said to me has been fulfilled to the very letter.\n\nIn the afternoon, President Young wrote another letter, this one addressed to the Nauvoo Trustees. He included one of Captain Allens circulars asking for volunteers and wrote, By this time you will probably exclaim, is this Gospel? We answer, yes. We shall raise these five hundred men from among those who are driving teams between this [Mount Pisgah] and Council Bluffs. He mentioned that there were 2,805 wagons between and including those points.\n\nHis main purpose for this letter was to ask the Nauvoo Trustees to send all the men and boys on the road to Council Bluffs immediately, leaving behind women and children. These men would take the place of those who would leave for the Battalion. The men were needed to move the camp to Grand Island, build houses, and make hay. When they arrived at Grand Island, they would unload and quickly return to Nauvoo to take all of the Saints out of the city by fall. The Trustees were encouraged to sell the temple, but not use the money to buy more teams. Rather, it should be used to pay off the temple hands and gather provisions. They were instructed clearly to send Thomas Bullock and his family to the camp immediately. Finally, he mentioned that they received an offer to build a mill about fifteen miles north of Council Bluffs on the east side of the Missouri River.\n\nMonterey, California:\n\nCommodore Sloat, in command of the United States squadron in the Pacific, bombarded and captured Monterey, California\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 221‑26; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:57; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 176; Juvenile Instructor, 17:74; Nibley, Exodus to Greatness, 198, 99; Brown, Life of a Pioneer, 22‑25; Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church 3:380‑81; Mount Pisgah Journal, July 7, 1846; Ward ed., Winter Quarters, 67\n\nWednesday, July 8, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nIn his quest to find a way to get food for his family, Hosea Stout started going through all his things to select articles which he could take to the settlements to trade for provisions. However, his health was so poor that he knew that he would not be able to go.\n\nKeg Creek, Iowa:\n\nElder Woodruff, twelve miles from Council Bluffs, went to bless Sister Mary Ann Grant (wife of David Grant) who was in labor. About five minutes later she gave birth to a daughter whom they named Mary Ann Grant. He wrote, Thus the Saints bear children by the wayside like the Children of Israel in the wilderness.\n\nWilford Woodruff saw about fifty Sioux Indians pass the camp, heading east. They said they were going to meet the Mormon Chief. He supposed that they were referring to Brigham Young who was at Mount Pisgah.\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nBrigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards visited the Saints in Mount Pisgah during the morning, encouraging and blessing them. They paid a visit to Lorenzo Snow. Brother Snow was counseled to leave Mount Pisgah as soon as possible and to travel to the next planned settlement, Grand Island. Lorenzo Snow asked what he should do for provisions when he arrived there. President Young told him not to worry about that until he got there. Lorenzo Snow had recently moved into a house which had been used by Chandler Rogers, who went on to Council Bluffs. Brother Snow wrote, We had suffered much inconvenience living in Tent and wagons in the hot weather.\n\nThose who had already volunteered for the Mormon Battalion received some instructions from Charles C. Rich, then started for Council Bluffs.\n\nWillard Richards administered to Sister Moss who had been bitten by a rattlesnake. Brigham Young spent the evening with Willard Richards, Charles C. Rich, and Jesse C. Little.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 226‑27; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 176; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:57‑8; Beecher, ed., The Personal Writings of Eliza R.

Jenson, Andrew, 4:705\n\nThursday, July 9, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nWilford Woodruff finally arrived at Council Bluffs, completing his long journey to rejoin the main body of the Saints. His journey began when he left his mission in England on January 23, 1846. He soon located the camps of other members of the Twelve and enjoyed talking with Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor. Elder Woodruff pitched his tent on the bluff near John Taylors camp.\n\nThe brethren at Council Bluffs held a council meeting and wrote a letter to be circulated throughout the camp, requesting volunteers for the Mormon Battalion.\n\nFive hundred men must be raised forthwith for the expedition to California. Dont delay till the return of President Young; but come forward hastily . . . for be assured it is the mind and will of God that we should improve the opportunity which a kind providence has now offered for us to secure a permanent home in that country, and thus lay a foundation for a territorial or State Government, under the Constitution of the United States. . . . The season is passing rapidly away; and it will take some days to organize . . . and be assured that the Council and Camp will not move from this place until this thing is done.\n\nThe weather was very hot, but in the afternoon a cool and refreshing shower fell. Anson Call, who had recently arrived at Council Bluffs, lost another child. His son, Moroni Call died.\n\nCold Spring Camp, Nebraska:\n\nAcross the Missouri at the Cold Spring camp, several of the men hauled in a load of poles and bushes from which they made a fence and built a bowery.\n\nGeorge Miller, joined by John Butler and other members of the James Emmett company, left for their mission to journey 114 miles to the west. They were to go to the Pawnee Mission, which had been recently destroyed by the Sioux Indians.\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nAt 11:30 a.m., Brigham Young and many of the other leaders were escorted to Alpheus Cutlers encampment and Brother Davis camp where President Young addressed the brethren and ate dinner. At 2:40 p.m., the leaders left for Council Bluffs. Their visit to Mount Pisgah had been good for the Saints there. Sarah Rich, the wife of Charles C. Rich wrote, Their visit to us at this time was encouraging, for they left a good impression among the Saints which gave them new courage to preserve and prepare themselves for what was ahead of them.\n\nAt 5 p.m. Brigham Youngs company rested their animals on the prairie for a time and then continued until midnight after a journey of thirty miles. President Young and Heber C. Kimball slept sitting up in the carriage.\n\nMany of the new recruits for the battalion were on their way to Council Bluffs. James S. Brown wrote,\n\nWe bade our friends an affectionate farewell, and started on what we understood to be a journey of one hundred and thirty‑eight miles [to the bluffs], to join the army of the United States at our countrys call. We had provisions enough to put up to last us on our trip. . . . Our initial trip was begun without a blanket to wrap ourselves in, as we thought we could find shelter in the camps along the line of march. But in this we were mistaken, for everybody seemed to have all they could do to shelter their own. The first night we camped on the bank of a small stream, where we fell in with twelve or fifteen other volunteers who had not so much as a bit of bread. . . . We divided with them, then scraped what leaves we could and laid down thereon, with a chunk of wood for our pillow.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 226‑27, 589; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:58; Diary of Lorenzo Dow Young, Utah Historical Quarterly, 14:145; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 176; Hartley, My Best for the Kingdom, 210; Brown, Life of a Pioneer, 25‑6; Whitney, History of Utah, 4:144; Sarah Rich Autobiography, typescript, BYU, 58\n\nFriday, July 10, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nIt had rained all night and continued to rain during the day, causing many in the camp to stay in their tents all day. Captain James Allen and Indian Agent Robert B. Mitchell issued a proclamation granting permission to the Mormons to reside on Pottawatomie lands. This was an important point, requested by Brigham Young during the negotiations to raise the battalion. The proclamation acknowledged that many of the men would have to leave their families behind, which necessitated this action.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nBrigham Young and company arose early, broke camp by 4:30 a.m., and rode a half mile to have breakfast with Samuel and Daniel Russell. President Youngs company continued on until a little after 9 a.m. when they rested their teams during a thunder shower. At about 1 p.m., they halted their journey when some Fox Indians met then and asked the Mormon Chiefs to wait until they could send for their chief who had something to say to them. They agreed to delay their trip ‑‑ it was raining very heavily anyway.\n\nThe chief, named Powsheek, arrived at 7 p.m. He wanted to see the Mormon chief, to learn where the Mormons came from and where they were going. Powsheek stated that his people were going off with the Pottawatomies who had recently sold their land to the government. He was interested in traveling with the Mormons as they traveled to their new tribal lands.\n\nJames S. Brown continued his trek to join the battalion. We journeyed, much of the time in heavy rain and deep mud, sleeping on the wet ground without blankets or other kind of bedding, and living on elm bark and occasionally a very small ration of buttermilk handed to us by humane sisters as we passed their tents.\n\nNear Fort Laramie, Wyoming:\n\nThe Mississippi Company of Saints, consisting of about fourteen families, decided to leave the Oregon Trail and head south to spend the winter on the Arkansas River at what would later be called Pueblo, Colorado. They had met a man named John Richards, who had a fur trading post at Fort Bernard, about eight miles east of Fort Laramie. Richards told them that Mormons were going up the South Fork of the Platte. When the Mississippi Company learned this news, they held a council and decided not to head farther west, but to find a place to spend the winter on the east side of the mountains. Richards told them that the head of the Arkansas River was the best place, where corn was growing, and settlements were nearby where they could get supplies. He was on the way to take buffalo robes to Taos [New Mexico] from his trading post and offered to be their guide. The Saints decided to follow Richards to Pueblo.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nDaniel Bailey, age forty-two, died. He was the husband of Sarah Currier Bailey.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 227‑28; Brown, Life of a Pioneer, 26; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 176; Journal History; John Brown Journal, Our Pioneer Heritage, Vol. 2, p.428; Black, Membership of the Church 1830‑1848\n\nSaturday, July 11, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nWilford Woodruff went to visit Thomas L. Kane, who had also recently arrived at Council Bluffs. Colonel Kane informed him that President Polk was very favorable toward the Mormons. Elder Woodruff wrote, Col Kane manifested the spirit of a gentleman and much interest in our welfare. From the information we received from him, we were convinced that God had began to move upon the heart of the President and others in this nation to begin to act for our interest and the general good of Zion. Hosea Stout also met Kane. He wrote of him, he was quite an intelligent man notwithstanding he was uncommonly small and feminine. John Taylor wrote, We had some conversation with him [Kane] during which he manifested a spirit of sympathy for us.\n\nAfter meeting with the brethren, Col. Kane wrote a letter to George Bancroft, the secretary of the navy. Col. Kane had intended to travel with Mormons to California during this season but he wrote, Every day, too, renders it more vain for the [Mormon] people to attempt proceeding to California this season, and I have been acquainted confidentially by those in authority, that such has ceased to be their intention. Thus he informed Bancroft that he would not be traveling to California during this year.\n\nPhinehas Richards company arrived at the Council Bluffs area and set up camp near John Van Cotts tent. Mary Richards felt very weary after the long journey from Mount Pisgah.\n\nBetween Mount Pisgah and Council Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nBrigham Young again met with the Indian Chief Powsheek. He authorized Cyrus H. Wheelock to give a two‑year‑old heifer to the Indians. Powsheek was still interested in locating his tribe near the Mormons. President Young told him that after they settled over the mountains that they would send men to hunt for them in return for blankets, guns and other goods. Powsheek spoke of Joseph Smith and his murder. He had been acquainted with the Prophet and knew that he was a great and good man.\n\nAt 8:10 a.m., Brigham Young and his company started their journey again. At 10:22 a.m., they stopped at the west branch of the Nodaway to visit with Ezra Chase. They continued on at 11:30 a.m. and arrived at Pottawatomie Indian Village at 1:45 p.m. An Indian presented to them two sheets of hieroglyphics from the Book of Abraham and also a letter from their father, Joseph dated 1843. The company continued on and arrived at the Nishnabotna at 8 p.m. where they camped for the night. Brigham Young tried to sleep in his carriage but the mosquitoes were bad and he only had a little rest.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nA few Mormons left Nauvoo and traveled about twelve miles, near Pontoosuc to harvest a field of grain with some of the new non‑Mormon citizens. As they were working, at 9 a.m., a company of about twelve men was seen on the north side of the field. Another company of 50‑60 was on the west and a third company on the east. They were trapped. The workers sent one of their men, James Huntsman, with a white handkerchief to meet them. He asked the mob leader what they wanted. You shall soon know! The workers were surrounded and their guns were taken from them. One member of the mob threatened to blow out the brains of Archibald Newell Hill if he did not give up his gun.\n\nThe mob took the men to the house and after getting some hickory switches, they took each man, two at a time to the field and gave them each twenty lashes. Archibald Hills brother, John, recorded, I was taken out, placed in the ditch on my knees with my breast on the bank, and a man wielded a large hickory switch with both his hands across my shoulders striking me twenty‑one times, which disabled me from doing the least service for myself for about a week. The mob then smashed several of their guns and stole the others. The men were ordered to go back to Nauvoo and not to look back. After they had gone fifty yards, a gun went off and a ball whizzed close to John Hills head.\n\nWhen word of this outrage was received back at Nauvoo, a handbill was issued calling for the arrest of the men who beat the Hills. A company of sixty men was organized. They left Nauvoo at 10 p.m., and proceeded to the mob leaders house, John McAuley (or MCalla). They succeeded in arresting him late at night.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 228‑32; Rich, Ensign to the Nations, 39; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:58; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 177; John Taylors Journal; The Historians Corner, BYU Studies, 18:1:127; Lyman Littlefield Reminiscences (1888), 167‑68; Ward, ed., Winter Quarters, 69\n\nSunday, July 12, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nBrigham Young and his traveling companions broke camp at 4 a.m., rode for a few miles, and ate breakfast with Pleasant Ewell. They then continued on and visited the various camps along the way, passing 30‑40 companies. They finally arrived at Council Bluffs and stopped at Elder John Taylors camp on the bluff, which was about sixty feet west of the lower bridge on Mosquito Creek. Wilford Woodruff was camping near this bridge. Elder Parley P. Pratt was camping about 160 feet to the north.\n\nA meeting was held at 5:30 p.m. in a large bowery which had been recently put up between Elder Taylors tent and Elder Woodruffs tent. Before the meeting, a Liberty Pole was raised nearby by William J. Johnston and Samuel H. Rogers. It consisted of a white sheet with an American flag underneath. The pole would be a rallying point for raising the Battalion.\n\nAt the meeting, Elder Woodruff spoke for an hour, telling about his mission to England. Mary Richards wrote to her husband, Samuel W. Richards who was on his way to England, [Elder Woodruff] spoke of the prosperity of the Church there, said if 50 good Elders would go there who would know or teach nothing [but] Christ and him Crucified for was all they had aught to teach that they would find plenty to do & their labors would be blest with success.\n\nElder Parley P. Pratt next spoke and condemned the common practice of swearing among the men and boys. He then spoke about the raising of the battalion, trying to further convince the Saints that it was the right thing to do. Even Hosea Stout was feeling better about it. Indeed it needed considerable explaining for every one was about as much prejudiced as I was at first. John Taylor also spoke and tried to convince the audience that defeating the Mexicans was in the best interests of the Church because the Mexican government would only tolerate the Catholic faith.\n\nAt 6 p.m., the Council met to write a letter to Orson Pratt, who was across the Missouri River. They wanted to notify all those who had already enlisted, to come to the main camp for a meeting in the morning. All of the other brethren were notified to attend a meeting at noon.\n\nPontoosuc, Illinois:\n\nPhinehas Young, his son Brigham, Richard Ballanyne, and James Standing arrived at Pontoosuc at 10 a.m. They were on their way home to Nauvoo after purchasing flour at McQueens Mill in Henderson County. A Mrs. Hanover came running toward them, asking if they were Mormons and told them to flee. She said a mob had one of the Mormons, James Herring, and was swearing that they would cut him to pieces and kill every Mormon they could find. They had heard enough, and started to flee as fast as they could. As they approached Appanoose, while watering their horses, ten armed men came up yelling and screaming, pointing guns, asking if they were Mormons. Phinehas said they were. The mob demanded that they return to Pontoosuc. They asked why. The reply was, because you are Mormons. The Mormons questioned the mens authority. The mobs reply was, By God gentlemen, these weapons are our authority. They were taken back to Pontoosuc, where they were met by fifty armed men, including apostate Francis M. Higbee. Higbee told them that they were being taken hostage for the safety of McAuley and the others who had been arrested in Nauvoo.\n\nThe brethren were taken to Jeremiah Smiths store house, near the river, and kept under a guard until the evening. Then they were taken in a wagon under heavy guard toward McQueens mill. They soon came to a thicket of brush, were taken through a gate into the woods, and then on to a prairie. Next, they were ordered to get out of the wagon and form a line. Phinehas Young asked if they were going to kill them. The hostages were assured that they would be safe as long as they did not try to escape and if the prisoners at Nauvoo were freed.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nThe Nauvoo posse brought mob leader, John McAuley to Nauvoo in the morning. Later in the day, the new citizens received a letter from Phinehas Young and others who had been taken hostage by the mob. They wrote:\n\nThe citizens of Pontoosuc have taken five of us (Mormons) in retaliation for the arrest of Maj. McAuley and Mr. Brattle and perhaps others, and intend to detain us as hostages for the safety and release of those gentlemen. They are determined to retaliate for any outrage or insult that those gentlemen may receive, upon us, we therefore request that you will immediately release the gentlemen alluded to, so that we may gain our liberty and safety; you may depend upon this resolution being carried into effect.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 232‑33, 277‑78; John Taylor Journal; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 177; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:59; Ward, ed., Winter Quarters, 75; Bennett, Mormons at the Missouri, 1846‑1852, 261\n\nMonday, July 13, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nHeavy rain showers fell, which lasted until 10 a.m. Jesse C. Little offered to deliver a letter for Mary Richards to her husband, Samuel W. Richards, who recently left on his mission to England. Mary wrote in her letter, I have got up in the waggon to try to write one but it rains so fast & the wind blows so hard that I find it almost impossible, the things are piled so high in the waggon that I cannot sit upright & you can well see that the rain blotches every mark I try to make.\n\nAt 11 a.m., the battalion recruitment meetings began. Major Jefferson Hunt called out the first company of volunteers. Brigham Young met with Thomas L. Kane and mentioned that the time would come when the Saints would support the government of the U.S. or it would crumble to atoms.\n\nLater, at 12:45 p.m., a general meeting for the camp was held. Music was played by the band. Brigham Young arose and addressed the large assembly under the bowery. He stated that the purpose for the meeting was to furnish the five hundred volunteers that were needed for the battalion. He mentioned that many were worried about leaving their families behind, but he said, My experience has taught me that it is best to do the things that are necessary and keep my mind exercised in relation to the future. . . . The blessings we are looking forward to receive will be attained through sacrifice. We want to raise volunteers.\n\nHe mentioned that many felt that he did not understand their unique circumstances. He replied that there was not time to reason with them. We want to conform to the requisition made upon us, and we will do nothing else, till we have accomplished this thing. If we want the privilege of going where we can worship God according to the dictates of our consciences, we must raise the battalion. Some feared that they would die, fighting in battles. He countered the argument by prophesying, All the fighting that will be done will be among yourselves, I am afraid. He pressed on, stated that they had enough men in Council Bluffs on this day to raise the five hundred men needed, they did not even need to wait for the men at Mount Pisgah. After they were finished talking, volunteers would be called to come forward.\n\nColonel Thomas L. Kane arose and apologized for being too sick to speak, but he endorsed the words of President Young. Elder Orson Hyde next spoke and called, Arise, then, the standard is raised, the call is made. Shall it be in vain, NO! Let us rally to the standard and our children will reverence our names; it will inspire in them gratitude which will last for ever and ever!\n\nBrigham Young again spoke and mentioned that they had been fleeing from the old settlers of various places for years. Well, they now had the chance to be the old settlers themselves in the west. If any man comes and says get out, we will say, get out. He closed by promising the men that their families left behind would be taken care of.\n\nThe men voted that Brigham Young and the council should nominate the officers for the battalion. Captain Allen, of the U.S. Army, spoke and expressed his impatience, that time was wasting away. The battalion must be raised now. Any time wasted would have to be made up on the road. Captain Allen spoke of clothing that would be needed included some warm wool clothing. Merchandise would be available to purchase at Fort Leavenworth at reasonable prices. Brigham Young again spoke up and said, Those who go on this expedition will never be sorry, but glad to all eternity; but those who are not here to go will be sorry.\n\nAt 5 p.m. the council met together to nominate officers. Before the day was through, three and a half companies of at least seventy men each were organized. The captains named were Jefferson Hunt, Jesse D. Hunter, James Brown and Nelson Higgins.\n\nHosea Stout spoke for a time with George A. Smith. Brother Smith explained how Jesse C. Little and Thomas L. Kane had worked with the government to bring about the battalion. Brother Stout was finally convinced, This made the matter plain and I was well satisfied for I found that there was no trick in it.\n\nAt 6 p.m., a large party was held under the bowery with dancing to the music of the band until dusk. William Clayton played with the band. He was distressed because he watched all of his teamsters enlist in the battalion. He reflected on his sad circumstances. He still had four yoke of oxen missing. His children were sick and he was being asked to look after Edward Martins family while he was away with the battalion. He wrote, on the whole, my situation is rather gloomy.\n\nMary Richards was invited to attend the dance. She later wrote about the dance to her husband, Samuel W. Richards. Brother Brigham came & introduced Bro Little to me & desired me to dance with him. I did so . . . this is the first time I have danced since I danced with my Samuel in the House of the Lord.\n\nIn the evening, Elder Orson Hyde spoke at length on the law of adoption, which was the practice at that time to seal people to some of the leaders of the church. This doctrine was new to many at the meeting. Elder Hyde desired that all who felt willing to do so, to give him a pledge to come into his kingdom when the ordinance could be attended to.\n\nLuther Terry Tuttle and Abigail Haws were married on this day at Council Bluffs.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nThe arrested mob leaders were examined before the authorities in Nauvoo. There was great tension in the city. The new citizens again called for help from the Mormons to organize for the defense of the city.\n\nNews had been received in Nauvoo about the raising of the battalion and the teams which were on the way back for the poor. The saints were greatly cheered by the proposals made to move the poor out.\n\nNear Nauvoo, Illinois:\n\nPhinehas Young and the other hostages were moved the next morning when an alarm was given that a posse of Mormons was in pursuit of them. It was determined that the hostages should be shot. Phinehas reasoned with the wicked men that if they did shoot them, the noise would bring the whole Mormon force down on them. The leader, Old Whimp was convinced and decided to move them, but if they made a noise, or tried to get away, he would kill them. They were taken to the thickest part of the forest and led through thickets and swamps, arriving at William Logans home after a journey of about twelve miles. They had been driven like wild beasts at the point of a bayonet. Brother Ballantyne was quite sick. They were fed some corn and bacon, then taken to the woods and forced to march two more miles. They were then lined up and Old Whimp and the others loaded their guns and cocked them. As Phinehas was protesting, Mr. Logan rode up and warned them that the Mormons were within a half mile. The guards shouldered their guns and forced the men to march again to another spot where they were made to lay still for the night.\n\nPontoosuc, Illinois:\n\nBrother William Anderson was appointed deputy sheriff to raise a posse of 50 men to go in search of the hostages. They traveled through the night and arrived at Pontoosuc at daybreak. They discovered that a large company of men was in the brush just outside the town. The posse searched the brush on both sides of the road and soon found them. Many of them had their rifles cocked and were taking aim. They were led by apostates Francis and Chauncey Higbee. The mob numbered about three hundred men.\n\nWilliam Anderson called out to the mob:\n\nO, yes we know you are there, and we know how many you number. If there were five times as many there we should not be afraid of you. There are only 50 of us here but there are five hundred a little way back. We have the authority and hold the powers to search the town for our brethren. If any one of you snaps a cap we will lay your town in ashes. We command you in the name of Sheriff Backenstos whose servants we are, to come out of the bushes and lay down your arms.\n\nThe men came out and gave up their arms. The posse took the Higbees and others prisoner and then searched the town for the hostages but could not find them.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 233‑38, 278‑79, 329; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 178; William Claytons Journal, 54; Ward, ed., Winter Quarters, 78; George Morris Autobiography, typescript, BYU; LDS Biographical Encyclopedia. Jenson, Andrew, 3:729\n\nTuesday, July 14, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nAt 9 a.m., the first Mormon Battalion company (Company A) with Jefferson Hunt as the captain, started to make out their muster roll. Another general meeting was held, calling for more volunteers. Heber C. Kimball addressed the gathering and said the opportunity for raising the Mormon Battalion should be acknowledged to be one of the greatest blessings that the great God of heaven ever did bestow upon this people. By 10:30, the fourth company was filled up and marched out under the direction of Orson Pratt. The Council met together to select the officers in that company.\n\nMany of the young men desired to enlist. Eighteen-year-old Aroet Hale wrote:\n\nI had a desire to go with the battalion as a drummer boy, being a member of the martial band in Nauvoo. . . . President Heber C. Kimball talked to me. Said he, Aroet, you have been away from your father and mother five months in the camp of Israel, as a teamster. Your dear father is on crutches with a broken leg and no help but your mother and her little ones. I took President Kimballs counsel and well that I did.\n\nIt was about this day that Colonel Thomas L. Kane, still recovering from his illness, was taking a walk through the woods near the camp with Henry G. Boyle. They passed by a man praying in secret hear the edge of the woods. Brother Boyle wrote: It seemed to affect [Kane] deeply, and as we walked away he observed that our people were a praying people, and that was evidence enough to him that we were sincere and honest in our faith. As they walked on, they walked near yet another man beginning to pray. Boyle wrote:\n\nWe had involuntarily taken off our hats as though we were in a sacred presence. I never can forget my feelings on that occasion. Neither can I describe them, and yet the Colonel was more deeply affected that I was. As he stood there I could see the tears falling fast from his face, while his bosom swelled with the fullness of his emotions. And for some time after the man had arisen from his knees and walked away towards his encampment, the Colonel sobbed like a child and could not trust himself to utter a word.\n\nHosea Stout had a long interview with Brigham Young, seeking his counsel and desires. Brother Stout recounted his days of suffering as he tried to carry out Brigham Youngs order to bring the public arms to Council Bluffs. Brigham Young told him that he wanted him to continue to work for the Church in a military role. After the battalion left, he wanted to organize a military organization that Brother Stout would be involved in. He asked Brother Stout to not say anything about it before the battalion left, because it would only hinder their desires to go. President Young also took compassion on Hosea Stouts destitute condition. He let him borrow 109 pounds of flour from Wilford Woodruff and told him that he could borrow anything he needed. This brought great joy to Brother Stout who wrote, My prospects for living seemed to brighten for he acted like a friend that was willing to help in time of need.\n\nCharles Decker returned to Council Bluffs and reported that George Miller and the James Emmett company were sixty miles to the west, on their way to the Pawnee Mission (see July 6, 1846).\n\nIn the afternoon, a council meeting was held at John Taylors camp. Many important decisions were made. It was decided to not send the entire camp to Grand Island. Instead, as soon as the battalion left, the Twelve would find a location on the east side of the Missouri river for a winter settlement. A small company would be sent to Grand Island, on the Platte River, to build a fort and prepare for a settlement. Bishop George Miller would be sent ahead with a company over the mountains. Finally, it was decided to send two of the Twelve to England on a mission to set things back in order. The Twelve also discussed sending some settlers to Vancouver Island.\n\nEdward Martins youngest child died at 1:30 p.m.\n\nAt 5 p.m., the volunteers for the battalion arrived from Mount Pisgah. One of their number, James S. Brown, recounted:\n\nWe had excellent music, the best dinner that the country could afford, and, above all, a spirit of brotherly love and union that I have never seen surpassed. With all on the altar of sacrifice for God and His kingdom and for our country, it seemed that everything and everybody looked to the accomplishment of one grand, common cause, not a dissenting voice being heard from anyone.\n\nMary Richards also attended this dance. She noted that the Twelve did not dance until the last figure. Bro Brigham took me for a partner. We danced the hopa reel.\n\nThe dancing continued until 8:30 p.m. in the camp on Redemption Hill. Brigham Young gave the ridge a new name, calling it Chime Ridge because on the night before he laid on the chime of a barrel in a wagon.\n\nEliza Partridge Lyman, wife of Amasa M. Lyman gave birth to a son, Don Carlos Lyman. Eliza would be very ill for some time. She wrote, I am very uncomfortably situated for a sick woman. The scorching sun shines on the wagon through the day, and the cool air at night is almost too much to be healthy. Also, Sarah Elsa Dame, was born to Andrew and Sophia Dame. Patty Sessions helped deliver both these babies.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nTensions were growing to a boiling point again in the county. Deputy Sheriff H.G. Ferris wrote a letter to G. Edmunds Jr.\n\nThings are hot here. Threats and demonstrations are made of the most decided character. They say the matter now will not be confined to lynching [whipping]! But that the whole city (Nauvoo) shall be destroyed ‑‑ the property of the new citizens as well as that of Mormons shall go together, for the former, or at least a majority of them are as bad as the Mormons! . . . Already they have threatened to shoot me in the streets if I did not leave. What they will do I dont know. . . . If the cowardly devils do put their threats into execution, I have only to say that I hope my friends and the friends of all those injured will avenge their indignities and brutality....I understand the mobbers have sent messengers to every part of the country to raise a force. No efforts will be spared and no lies will fail to be manufactured to accomplish the object.\n\nA son, Hyrum Bassett, was born to Hiram and Lucinda Bassett.\n\nNear Nauvoo, Illinois:\n\nVery early in the morning while it was still dark, Phinehas Young and the other hostages were forced to march to the north, staying in the brush and fields until dawn. When they arrived at Shockoquon, they were given some food and then taken to an island on the Mississippi River, where they had to lie in nettles and mosquitoes until midnight.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 238‑41, 279; William Claytons Journal, 54; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 178‑79; Heber C.

During this gloomy weather, William Clayton went with Edward Martin to bury his child on a high bluff, south of the camp on Mosquito Creek. They buried the child between two small oak trees. When William Clayton returned, he was instructed to move his camp across the creek, to the bluff that John Taylor was camping on.\n\nA council meeting was held in Elder John Taylors tent. Brigham Young proposed that he would cross the Missouri River to visit his family. He wanted Elders Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards to join him. The rest of the Twelve would stay in Council Bluffs to instruct the Mormon Battalion.\n\nLots were cast between Elder Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt and John Taylor to determine who should go to England. The lot fell on Elders Hyde and Taylor.\n\nThe Council discussed plans for the battalion after they were discharged. President Young suggested that they stay in California and work. He further remarked:\n\nThe next temple would be built in the Rocky mountains, and I should like the Twelve and the old brethren to live in the mountains, where the Temple will be erected. . . . I could prophesy that the time would come when some one of the Twelve or a High Priest would come up and say, can we not build a Temple on Vancouver Island, or in California. It is now wisdom to unite all forces to build one house in the mountains.\n\nCaptains Jefferson Hunt and Jesse Hunter of the battalion called on the council to discuss wages to be paid to the battalion members when they arrived at Fort Leavenworth. The fifth company would be mustered at 5 p.m. Jesse C. Little was assigned to meet with Captain Allen to obtain an authorization for the camp to stay in Council Bluffs or any place west of the Missouri River. He did obtain this authorization. The following day Captain Allen finished an order that read in part, The Mormon people, now en route to California, are hereby authorized to pass through the Indian country on that route, and they may make stopping places at such points in the Indian country as may be necessary to facilitate the emigration of their whole people to California, and for such time as may be reasonably required for this purpose.\n\nHosea Stout went to John Taylors camp in the morning and was surprised that he was to receive 1900 pounds of bread stuff by order of Brigham Young. He was to be given enough provisions for eight people to last a year. He also received good news from Jesse D. Hunter that his cows had been found and were on their way to Council Bluffs.\n\nA baptism was held for two brothers, Daniel and Miles Miller who recently enlisted into the battalion. Daniel was baptized by Elder A. Love, and on the following day he ordained an Elder by President Brigham Young and George A. Smith.\n\nA son, Hyrum Scott, was born to John and Mary Scott.\n\nIn the evening, Elder Parley P. Pratt instructed the battalion soldiers. They were not to abuse any enemies that might fall into their hands, but to remember that they were our fellow beings to whom the gospel is yet to be preached. They should be honest in their dealings.\n\nMount Pisgah, Iowa:\n\nSister Eliza R. Snow commented that Mount Pisgah had very few men in the settlement. So many had gone on to join the battalion that the settlement was almost entirely made up of sisters. She was hard at work braiding hat timber (straw). Louisa Pratt (Addison Pratts wife) wrote I called on Sisters Markham, Eliza R. Snow, and Dana. They all seem resigned to the times and circumstances. I wish I could. I pray earnestly for submission.\n\nNear Nauvoo, Illinois:\n\nA little after midnight, a shrill whistle was heard from shore. The alarm was sounded that the Mormons were coming. The guards came to the hostages and pled for the brethren to protect them from the Mormons. The hostages agreed, but it was soon learned that it was a false alarm. They were next ordered to leave the island and were led downstream on a trail very quickly for some hours. After they turned east and ascended the bluffs, they came to Mr. Giddens farm. Soon, another alarm was sounded that the Mormons were covering the Mississippi River bottoms. They were taken back out to the woods and given some food.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nThe Nauvoo Trustees wrote a letter to Brigham Young, which he did not receive until a month later, on August 17. They had recently received a letter from President Young asking that young men be sent on to Council Bluffs to help backfill the loss of men to the battalion. They wrote, We shall use all our influence to induce young men to hasten to you; but we have but few left in this place. . . . We are again in the midst of war and anarchy which has become quite a natural element with us. . . . In relation to sending back teams, it will be necessary to send them as soon as possible, or else on their return it will be too late to sustain them by grass. They reported on efforts to sell the temple. There had been some interest, but funds had not been raised to secure the deal. Finally they asked to forward word to Elder Woodruff that the man who bought his home died and was buried on the lot.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 241‑42, 279, 329; Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church 3:125‑26, 137; Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:59; Brooks, ed., On the Mormon Frontier, The Diary of Hosea Stout 1844‑1861, 179; William Claytons Journal, 54; Beecher, ed., The Personal Writings of Eliza R. Snow, 138; Jenson, LDS Biographical Encyclopedia, 4:755; Louisa Pratt Autobiography, Heart Throbs of the West 8:241\n\nThursday, July 16, 1846\n\nCold Spring Camp, Nebraska:\n\nBrigham Young and Heber C. Kimball were across the Missouri River at the camp called Cold Spring. At 9 a.m., they met with the brethren who were in that camp. Elder Kimball asked the brethren to decide whether they wanted to enlist in the Battalion, go over the mountains, go to Grand Island, or go back over the river for the winter. The emphasis of this meeting was to raise volunteers to go over the mountains. Many wanted to go over the mountains. Others wanted to go to Grand Island. Volunteers were asked to help repair the road by the ferry.\n\nAt noon, the members of the Twelve at Cold Spring walked out on to the prairie to further discuss the problems in the British Mission.\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nThe Mormon Battalion volunteers arose early in the morning to make last‑minute preparations. Elder Parley P. Pratt baptized William Sidney Willes, who was leaving with the battalion.\n\nBefore he left, nineteen-year-old John Riggs Murdock became engaged to Almira Lott. He later wrote, She, who was so greatly admired for her beauty and intelligence, that her hand was sought by many, while separated from me for more than two years, and in the greatest uncertainty as to whether I would ever return, remained true to her promise.\n\nThe time finally arrived for the Mormon Battalion to be officially called into service. Mary Ann Jackson Woodruff recalled, I stood and watched the battalion break camp for their long western march, composed of the beardless youth and the white‑haired veteran.\n\nFour companies of the Mormon Battalion, about four hundred men, were officially mustered into service. They were formed into a square by their captains on Redemption Hill, where they were addressed by members of the Twelve. They then marched double file seven miles down the bluffs to the flats by the river at the ferry crossing.\n\nAt 1:30 p.m., Brigham Young (at Cold Spring) had started for the river and by 2:30 had crossed over and met with the volunteers who were ready to be delivered over to newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel Allen for service in the Mormon Battalion.\n\nColonel Allen read an order to the battalion, In virtue of authority given me by the Col. commanding the army of the west, I hereby assume the command of the Mormon Battalion, raised at this place for the service of the United States. Therefore, companies now organized will be held in readiness to march at the shortest notice, and as soon as the fifth company be filled all will be ready for movement.\n\nWilford Woodruff wrote:\n\nThe battalion have thus stepped forth promptly and responded to the call of the government . . . leaving families, teams and wagons standing by the way side, not expect to meet or see them again for one or two years. . . . And while casting my eyes upon them I consider I was viewing the first battalion of the Army of Israel engaged in the United States service for one year and going to lay the foundation of a far greater work even preparing the way for the building of Zion.\n\nThe battalion was then taken to Traders Point where Colonel Allen issued provisions which included, camp kettles, knives, forks, spoons, plates, coffee, sugar and blankets. These items were deducted from their first pay.\n\nHenry Bigler still felt insulted to having to join the battalion, but he wrote, there was one consolation and that was Brother Willard Richards . .. said, If we were faithful in keeping the commandments of God, that not a man shall fall by an enemy, no not as much blood shed as there was at Carthage jail.\n\nAfterwards Brigham Young went to Orson Pratts tent on the flats near the bank of the Missouri River. Members of the Twelve met with Bishop Newel K. Whitney and Jesse C. Little for a council meeting.\n\nTwo Indians came with a letter from Major Robert B. Mitchell asking the leaders about six stray horses. They sent a reply that they had no knowledge of them but would ask the camp to be on the lookout for them.\n\nThe council attended to a very sacred matter. The Twelve unanimously sustained Ezra T. Benson to be ordained an Apostle. President Brigham Young then offered a prayer as they knelt together. When they arose, they laid hands on Ezra T. Benson and ordained him an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑day Saints, with all the keys and power and blessings pertaining to the apostleship, and to take the crown of him (John E. Page) who has fallen from the Quorum of the Twelve. Elder Ezra T. Benson wrote later, I was ordained one of the Twelve Apostles . . . and many great and glorious things did he pronounce and seal upon my head. He said, I should yet have the strength of Sampson.\n\nThe Twelve rode up to Elder John Taylors tent on the bluff and at 7 p.m. had supper with Elder Woodruff. Afterwards, the Council met and decided by vote that Elders Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, and John Taylor should all go to England. Elders Reuben Hedlock and Thomas Ward were disfellowshipped from the Church. The Twelve drafted the following notice which would appear in the Churchs periodical in England, the Millennial Star: It now becomes our painful duty to lay before the church in England an act of the Count of the Twelve Apostles, in the American wilderness . . . The Twelve in Council, this day, voted that Reuben Hedlock, and Thomas Ward, be disfellowshipped until they shall appear before the Council and make satisfaction for their repeated disregard of the Council.\n\nNear Nauvoo, Illinois:\n\nDuring the night, the Mormon hostages were ordered to travel to the southeast through fields and forests for about ten miles, where they were taken into a house belonging to a brother of Mr. Giddins. Phinehas Youngs son, Brigham H. Young asked for some water and was refused. After much begging, the wicked men gave the hostages some liquor and water drugged with a corrosive sublimate. Only Brigham H. Young drank. He soon became very ill with a burning in his stomach and blindness. He started beating his head. Phinehas Young later wrote:\n\nWe imperceptibly laid our hands upon him in the dark and claimed the promised blessing, with a little help he was soon able to walk, and we were ordered to move on. We reached a large field of corn, where was an old house and well, where we were kept for an hour and a half, our guards watching to see the effects of the poison upon us, intending to put our bodies into the old well, but in this they were disappointed.\n\nA new guard, John Sanders, joined their ranks. He became a friend of the hostages and would tell Brigham H. Young all that was going on. When it was learned that the hostages would not die from the poison, they were ordered into a wagon and were taken to McDonough Count and shut up in a Mr. Johnsons corn house for one hour, then taken to the woods for the rest of the day.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 242‑44, 588, 279‑80; Tyler, a Concise History of the Mormon Battalion, 127‑28; Henry W.

Whitney, History of Utah, 4:191\n\nFriday, July 17, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nAt 9 a.m., Brigham Young met with the Twelve at John Taylors tent. He sent a letter of recommendation for Elders Hyde, Parley P. Pratt and Taylor who would be leaving for the British Isles on a mission.\n\nA meeting was held at 10 a.m. at the bowery, with the brethren who did not join the battalion. Brigham Young still proposed that a company go over the mountains this season. Another company would be sent to Grand Island for the winter which would send their teams back to help the poor come from Nauvoo. President Young told the brethren that they could choose to go or not, but those who would go over the mountains would have a hard time. He exhorted the assembly to remember the covenant they made in the temple that we never would cease our exertions till all were gathered.\n\nBishop Newel K. Whitney was instructed to gather the Church cattle and give them to Cornelius P. Lott who would take them up the river for the winter.\n\nForty or fifty volunteers were still needed to complete the battalion. President Young commented that hundreds would eternally regret that they did not go, when they had a chance, and retired. John Steele wrote that the leaders never ceased their effort to beat‑up for volunteers.\n\nElder Hyde next spoke, preaching about a parable of a woman in the wilderness and two wings of a great eagle. Elder Kimball stressed the importance of enlisting to fill up the battalion. At 10:30 a.m., the meeting was adjourned for a few minutes to receive the new volunteers and complete the fifth company. The meeting resumed at 11:30 when Elder Kimball asked for volunteers to work on the road on the west bank of the Missouri River. About twenty volunteers stepped forward. He also asked for contributions for Brother William Yokum who had been shot at Hauns Mill in 1838.\n\nBrigham Young proposed that brethren be selected to take care of the families left behind by the battalion soldiers. They brethren would act as bishops for the families. Ninety men were called to serve in this position. The Mormon Battalion members had been asked to leave their wages for the benefit of their families. The Bishops were to be held accountable to keep correct records of the money and property received and sold for their families.\n\nWilliam Draper was one of these men called and later ordained to be a bishop. He wrote, We could look in every direction and see the prairies dotted with wagons and tents and speckled with cattle, whose owners had gone. Now it was that something must be done for the women and children that was left unprovided for and without protection and in an Indian Country.\n\nAt 3 p.m., Brigham Young, others of the Twelve, and many other brethren left to search out a location for a winter settlement. They went to Traders point and then rode north through the woods, along some ridges and ended up, around 7:40 p.m. at Pigeon Creek, on the Missouri River. There, they camped for the night.\n\nA daughter, Mary Louisa Stocking, was born to John and Harriet Stocking.\n\nTraders Point, Iowa:\n\nMembers of the battalion were permitted to return and visit their families. William Hyde was one who returned and described his feelings:\n\nThe thoughts of leaving my family at this critical time are indescribable. Far from the land which we had once called civilized, with no dwelling save a wagon, with the scorching mid‑summer sun beating upon them, with the prospect of the cold December blast finding them in the same place. My family at this time consisted of a wife and two children, the eldest of which was but three and a half years old, and the situation of my wife was such as to require, if ever, the assistance and watch‑care of her companion.\n\nHe later added these feelings, which were echoed throughout the battalion, When we were to meet with them again, God only knew. Nevertheless, we did not feel to murmur.\n\nJames Pace was appointed to be First Lieutenant in Company E and was entitled to a servant to be paid $15 per month. Looking to keep the money in the family, he asked Colonel Allen for a furlough to go back to Mt. Pisgah to get his fourteen-year-old son, William. The request was granted and James Pace started his journey.\n\nNear Nauvoo, Illinois:\n\nAfter midnight, the hostages were made to travel until daylight, suffering much abuse from their guards. Brothers Ballantyne and Herring were worn out from sickness and fatigue. Nevertheless, they continued to be pricked with bayonets and threatened with death if they fell behind. At sunrise they were taken and hidden in some brush near a log house in the woods. During the day they were visited by strangers and new schemes were suggested for taking their lives. It was finally agreed to put a noose around their necks while they were asleep and strangle them. But Old Whimp said they did not have enough men there to dispose of the bodies in a mud slough near the Illinois River.\n\nNauvoo, Illinois:\n\nWord was received from Joseph Cain in England that the many Saints there were doing well and the Church was growing.\n\nSociety Islands in the South Pacific:\n\nOn his mission to the islands, Addison Pratt was dealing with the natives strong belief in superstitions. He commented: They used to have much witchcraft among them before the Bible was introduced amongst them, but since then, their wizards have lost most of their power. On this day he finally recovered from a bad headache which was brought on by an experience the previous Sunday. He was called on to bless a sister who was troubled by the powers of darkness because of her involvement with superstitions. As he anointed her, he described, I felt a heavy pressure upon top of my head and the powers of darkness overshadowed my mind, and brought with it a foretaste of the horrors of hell. Such feelings are not to be described, and are known only to those who experience them. This darkness remained 24 hours, but a severe pain in my head which commenced with the pressure, and lasted till today. The woman also recovered.\n\nSources:\n\nWatson, ed., Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 260‑63, 280, 329; Franklin Allen Journal, Church Archives; Jenson, LDS Biographical Encyclopedia, 1:759; Tyler, a Concise History of the Mormon Battalion, 128; John Steele Diary, typescript, BYU; Yurtinus, Recruiting the Mormon Battalion in Iowa Territory, BYU Studies, 21:4:484; Ellsworth, The Journals of Addison Pratt, 284‑85 Wilford Woodruffs Journal, 3:60‑1; William Draper Autobiography, typescript, BYU, 25‑6; Jenson, Church Chronology; History of the Church, 4:389; Our Pioneer Heritage, 20:385; William Pace Autobiography, BYU, 10\n\nFriday, July 18, 1846\n\nCouncil Bluffs, in Iowa:\n\nBrigham Young and other leaders were exploring the land north of Council Bluffs. Wilford Woodruff examined Pigeon Creek. He described it as a stream about fifteen feet wide and one to ten feet deep, with a hard blue clay bottom, well supplied with good fish. I saw a flock of ducks. One brother shot one. I went fishing and Brother [Cornelius] Lott caught one.\n\nHenry W. Miller and seven others were sent to scout out the country further to the north. Brigham Young and the other leaders returned south to Council Bluffs, arriving at 1 p.m.\n\nAt 5:25 p.m., President Young met with the officers of the Mormon Battalion in some cottonwoods near the bank of the Missouri River, by the ferry. He called for a complete list of the families and property which would be taken to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Many of the officers were permitted to take their families with them. Thirty‑three wives and many children were permitted to go. President Young also called for a report of the wages that would be issued.\n\nNext, Brigham Young gave some last instructions to the officers. They were to be fathers to their companies and manage their affairs by power and influence of their priesthood. He further promised that every man would return alive if they would perform their duties faithfully, without murmuring. The soldiers were counseled to pray every morning and evening in their tents. There must not be swearing, nor contentions with the Missourians or any people. They were to only preach to those who desired to hear and should not impose their faith on any people. Take your Bibles and Books of Mormon. Burn up cards if you have any. The officers should regulate any dances, but they should not dance with those of the world. If they were to engage in battle, they should treat prisoners well and never take a life if it could be avoided. Daniel Tyler said that President Young prophesied the no one would fall into the hands of the nations foes and their only fighting would be with wild beasts.\n\nElder Heber C. Kimball endorsed the words of President Young. He exhorted the brethren to turn to the Lord in humble prayer, to hold their tongues and to remember the Mormon motto to mind their own business. If there were sick among them, the Elders should be called in to rebuke all manner of diseases. Elders Taylor and Parley P. Pratt also briefly spoke.\n\nBrigham Young told the brethren that we should go into the Great Basin, which is the place to build temples, and where our strongholds should be against mobs. He mentioned that the battalion would probably be disbanded about eight hundred miles from the place where the Saints would gather. They were instructed to go to work in California for a season, save their means, and then to bring seeds to the Great Basin.\n\nBishop Newel K. Whitney, Daniel Spencer, and Jonathan H. Hale were asked to be agents, to go to Fort Leavenworth and receive the pay for the soldiers and their families. Brigham Young said, We consider the money you have received, as compensation for your clothing, a peculiar manifestation of the kind providence of our Heavenly Father at this particular time, which is just the time for the purchasing of provisions and goods for the winter supply of the Camp.\n\nWilliam Clayton went with the band to Traders Point where, they played at a farewell ball for the Mormon Battalion until sundown. One of the battalion, Guy Keysor wrote: Every one of the assembly was invited to join in the dance: officers, soldiers, citizens & natives ‑‑ Everything moved in perfect order . . . all was still and quiet and nothing was heard but the music, except now & then a soft breeze stealing over the tops of the lofty cottonwoods.\n\nThomas L. Kane was very impressed by this ball. He later recounted: a more merry dancing rout I have never seen, t"
