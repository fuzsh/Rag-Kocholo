With the ingenuity of something called the DOKA Shear Core Climber, or self-climber, the project is making safe and efficient strides.\n\n“Mutual of Omaha currently has the second largest self-climber ever built in the U.S.,” said Brian Krouse, Director of Construction with Lanoha Real Estate Company, the developer for the project. “Not only does the formwork provide a mold for forming the shear core, it also creates a safe working environment, serving as a hive of activity with crews working at three levels within the core.”\n\nOver the next several months, the construction crew will engage in a repetitive cycle of preparing, pouring and erecting the shear core. The self-climber, which is identifiable as a yellow encasement around the structure, creates a mobile concrete formwork system surrounding three levels of the structure at a time.\n\nThe entire self-climbing formwork structure weighs approximately 1 million pounds. The top deck, which is above the yellow encasement, receives materials while iron workers tie rebar for the walls. The middle level, inside the yellow encasement, is a work platform for installation of rebar for the shear walls, as well as steel embeds and block-outs to be installed in the walls before they are poured. The lowest level of the system is a working platform and gantry system for the installation of steel beams, metal deck and concrete that form the floors within the core.\n\nAfter the concrete is poured and sufficiently cured, 18 hydraulic cylinders lift the top two levels of the self-climber 15 feet to its new position. Once they are locked into place, the hydraulics lift the bottom level up to create the new platform position. The work cycle will repeat to a full height of 650 feet near the top of the tower. When the core work is complete, the tower crane will be used to disassemble the self-climber and safely lower its components to the ground.\n\n“The assembly of the self-climber itself has been a culmination of months of engineering, planning and pre-assembly of the many parts that create the mobile concrete formwork system,” Krouse said. “A representative from DOKA, which is based in Germany, will be on site every week to make sure all the components to this intricate system are working properly.”\n\nThe South 13th Street Business Improvement District took a step forward as the City Council approved a resolution to formally create the City’s newest BID. It is roughly bounded by Mason and Vinton streets along 13th Street and extends east to 12th and west to 14th streets.\n\nLike other BIDs – Downtown, Benson, and South 24th, among others – the 13th Street BID imposes a special assessment against real property located within the district’s boundaries to help fund infrastructure improvements, events, beautification efforts and maintenance of public improvements. Proponents of the BID seek to prioritize improvements to pedestrian experience and safety.\n\nThe former North Downtown Sol’s Jewelry and Loan properties at 507 and 514 North 16th Street will be sold to the City of Omaha under a development agreement with Kiewit.

One thing we can say with some degree of certainty is that Mr. Market is just confused, not in the middle of full-blown trauma.\n\nCurrently, Mr. Market is preoccupied with the short term. In a week or so, he’ll put on his rose-colored glasses and return to a calmer state of mind. What’s driving his short-term distraction is the media’s hysteria about the economy, and WHAT’S THE FED IS GOING TO DO NEXT???\n\nFor the last six months, the Fed has simply rearranging the chairs on the Titanic deck. The only people who believe that the Fed is capable of fine tuning the economy are the Fed and a bunch of academic economists who don’t get out much.\n\nWhat’s happened ever since The Fed stopped raising interest rates? Interest rates have gone up. The Fed does not set interest rates plural. They raise an interest rate singular. The only rate they can change is the discount rate – the rate they charge commercial banks to borrow from them. All the other rates are moved by the guys at the big banks and insurance companies who have skin in the game. When the Fed gets it wrong, they apologize. When bond traders get it wrong, they lose money.\n\nThat’s the short-term perspective. The longer-term perspective has to do with regression to the mean. This may sound like some highfalutin scientific theorem, but its rough English translation is, “things always return to the average.” An example of this is your local average temperature. When you have a hotter-than-normal summer, you might experience a colder-than-normal winter. If you didn’t, the average temperature would go up. And we know that, in most locations, the average temperature is fairly constant.\n\nFor the past century, the S&P 500 has grown at an average annual rate in the 10 percent range. Look at a chart of the S&P 500. It gently climbs upward to the right. You will also notice that in the process of doing this, it looks like a saw tooth. The market knows what the long-term trend line is, but there are times when it over shoots it. The only way for it to get back to normal is to go negative, but then it in the process, it over shoots it to the down side. The next step is to repeat the process all over again.\n\nMoral of the story: Forget the Needle, Buy the Haystack."
