        "text": "At the end of the 19th century, the Warner family came to America from Krasnosielc, a town near Warsaw that Russia had annexed from Poland.\n\nThe family name was originally Wonskolaser.\n\nThe brothers Warner were named Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack. There were eight other children in the family.\n\nIn 1903, the three eldest Warner brothers became \"Nickelodeon junkies,\" spending all their spare time and money on the five-cent moving picture machines.\n\nTo raise capital for his sons' entry into the film business, a passion that required no university degree, Benjamin Warner sold his gold watch and \"Bob,\" the horse that pulled his meat delivery wagon.\n\nSam procured a second-hand Edison kinetoscope projector, \"the machine that spells certainty of success in the motion picture business,\" to launch the partnership.\n\nSister Rose Warner played the organ at her brothers' first theater, the Cascade in New Castle, Pennsylvania.\n\nJack L. Warner was a \"chaser,\" the theater employee charged with getting audiences to leave their seats after one screening – in his case, by singing badly. He once demonstrated his technique, bellowing \"O sole mio!\"\n\nAlbert, physically the largest of the brothers, specialized in distribution and acted as a go-between for Harry and Jack, who frequently disagreed.\n\nSam Warner was keenly interested in technological innovation and saved the studio in the 1920s by championing talking pictures.\n\nJack L. Warner, 11 years Harry's junior, added the middle name Leonard to make his name sound \"classy.\" He dyed his trademark brush moustache brown.\n\nIn 1908, the brothers formed the Duquesne Film Exchange in western Pennsylvania to make it easier to obtain films that were in short supply. The business of distributing films proved more profitable than exhibiting them.\n\nJack L. Warner once passed off a negative print, in which black and white were reversed, as the first film made with \"all colored actors.\"\n\nWhen Thomas Edison tried to corner the film market in the Northeast, the Warner brothers moved to California, establishing offices at 18th and Main in Culver City before moving – temporarily – to Hollywood.\n\nJack L. Warner played a soldier with syphilis in OPEN YOUR EYES (1919), the studio's first World War I training film. In 1940, WB produced DR. EHRLICH'S MAGIC BULLET, commemorating the discovery of a cure for the disease.\n\nThe best-selling memoir of an American ambassador, \"My Four Years in Germany,\" provided the basis for Warner Bros.' first successful feature and was acquired with a contract that included Hollywood's first \"back end deal,\" a now commonplace arrangement requiring payment to artists only after a film has earned back its costs.\n\nWhile the actual historical character Beau Brummell; Clyde Fitch's eponymously named play; and a 1954 film adaptation all spell the name \"Brummell,\" WB's 1924 silent movie title is spelled BEAU BRUMMEL.\n\nSam Warner, 40, married Lina Basquette, 18, a performer in the Ziegfeld Follies on July 4, 1925. She was widowed two years later when Sam died of a cerebral hemorrhage two days before the premiere of THE JAZZ SINGER.\n\nWarner Bros. borrowed $7 million to purchase Vitaphone (\"The Living Voice\") in 1925 in order to create \"talkies.\"\n\nThe WB motto was \"educate, entertain and enlighten.\"\n\nThe first partial sound film by Warner Bros. was DON JUAN (1926) with John Barrymore, but the movie had no spoken dialogue. Instead, the soundtrack emphasized the clash of swords and boasted a musical accompaniment by the New York Philharmonic.\n\nThe original Rin Tin Tin, a German shepherd rescued by an American soldier from a French battlefield during World War I, became a cash cow for Warner Bros., appearing in 27 films before his death in 1932. \"Rinty\" sired 48 puppies and also spawned a hit television series in the 1950s.\n\nSynchronized speech only accounted for about two minutes of THE JAZZ SINGER (1927) starring Al Jolson, the first \"talkie.\"\n\nLeaving the premiere of the first talking picture, rival MGM producer Irving Thalberg remarked, \"This thing won't last.\"\n\nFlush with cash from THE JAZZ SINGER, Warner Bros. acquired a chain of theaters from The Stanley Company of America and the new Burbank studios of First National Pictures in 1928. Diversification helped safeguard the company when the stock market crashed a year later.\n\nSTEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), Disney's first Mickey Mouse cartoon, was inspired by the innovative synchronized speech in THE JAZZ SINGER.\n\nLooney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons joined Warner Bros. in 1930. Known for winking at the audience with topical film references and wise-cracking asides, these animated shorts offered an alternative to Walt Disney's brand.\n\nIn the surviving prints of MAMMY (1930) starring Al Jolson, two songs by Irving Berlin – \"The Call of the South\" and \"Knights of the Road\" – are missing.\n\nWB's first Looney Tunes release was SINKIN' IN THE BATHTUB (1930), featuring the songs \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" and \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\" in a romantic balcony scene. The cartoon ends with the words \"That's all, folks,\" later appropriated and embellished by Mel Blanc as the stuttering Porky Pig.\n\nHarry M. Warner believed that film should instruct and, consistent with the Production Code, insisted that gangster movies like THE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) conveyed the message that \"crime does not pay.\"\n\nIn the original THE MALTESE FALCON (1931), the role of Sam Spade, later made famous by Humphrey Bogart, is played by Ricardo Cortez.\n\nThe release of Warner Bros.' I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (1932), which depicted brutality by guards, forced prison reform throughout the United States.\n\nIn the 1930s, Glenda Farrell played Torchy Blane, an investigative reporter who was always a step ahead of her police detective boyfriend, in seven of the nine \"B\" movies in the WB series.\n\nOne year after Adolf Hitler became Germany's chancellor in 1933, Warner Bros., alone among the major studios, refused to sell to the German market, a principled stand that cost the studio the growing overseas portion of its box office revenue.\n\nIn Busby Berkeley's FOOTLIGHT PARADE (1933), the musical number, \"By a Waterfall,\" uses a stage space larger than the entire theater that is meant to contain it.\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Leslie Howard originated their roles in THE PETRIFIED FOREST (1936) in the Broadway stage version of Robert E. Sherwood's play.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan sued Warner Bros. for defamation over BLACK LEGION (1937) – and lost.\n\nJack L. Warner once told Albert Einstein that he had a theory of relativity, too – \"Don't hire them!\"\n\nIn the 1930s, the Production Code prohibited Warner Bros. from going ahead with a production called CONCENTRATION CAMP, which was intended to educate the western world about Nazi atrocities, by threatening to contact the State Department about the perceived offense to a foreign government.\n\nJames Cagney, often cast as a gangster in WB movies, plays Bottom, the Weaver in the WB production of Shakespeare's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (1935).\n\nHarry M. Warner personally removed the word \"Jew\" from the script of THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA (1937), drawing criticism from his co-religionists yet making the film a more universal statement about prejudice.\n\nWB's NANCY DREW – DETECTIVE (1938) starring Bonita Granville was adapted from the 1933 \"Nancy Drew\" novel, \"The Password to Larkspur Lane,\" written for the Stratemeyer syndicate by Walter Karig under the pseudonym \"Carolyn Keene.\" (Granville served as Chair of the AFI Board of Trustees from 1986 to 1988.)\n\nBette Davis' red dress sequence in JEZEBEL (1938), a black-and-white WB film, was based on a real-life white ball in Hollywood at which all the women dutifully wore white with the conspicuous exception of Norma Shearer.\n\nWarner Bros.’ CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY (1939), based on an FBI case in New York, was the first explicitly anti-Nazi film made in America. It was produced in the face of numerous domestic and international threats, and reversed the policy of the Hays office, which governed film standards under the Production Code.\n\nGossip columnist Hedda Hopper reported that Sigmund Freud was a technical advisor on the WB film DARK VICTORY (1939), although the famous psychiatrist had died several months earlier.\n\nIn CASABLANCA, which won the Academy Award® for Best Picture of 1942, the climactic scene of Rick seeing off Ilsa and befriending Captain Renaud was shot at Van Nuys airport in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nHarry M. Warner opposed the resettlement of displaced Jews to Palestine, citing the potential for conflict with Arab neighbors. He wrote a paper on the subject, advocating an alternative Jewish settlement – in Alaska.\n\nJack L. Warner was seriously injured in a car accident five days after Harry's death from a stroke. Upon his return to the studio six months later, Jack fired his son for allowing the press to cast doubt on his ability to come back.\n\nTHE SEA WOLF (1941) became the first movie to have its world premiere at sea when the liner SS America screened it between San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nThe title of Ronald Reagan's 1965 autobiography, \"Where's the Rest of Me?,\" was taken from his most famous line of dialogue from WB's KINGS ROW (1942).\n\nNOW, VOYAGER (1942) was Bette Davis' biggest box office hit. The title phrase appears in \"The Untold Want,\" a poem by Walt Whitman quoted by Davis' character in the film.\n\nCHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT (1945) was released in August and shot in Burbank, California. Arnold Schwarzenegger directed the 1992 TV remake.\n\nJames Cagney, personally selected by George M. Cohan to bring his story to the screen, was 11 years older than his screen mother played by Rosemary DeCamp in WB's YANKEE DOODLE DANDY (1942).\n\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Bugs Bunny has appeared in more films than any other cartoon character.\n\nThe current voice of Bugs Bunny is Jeff Allen Bergman, who also voices Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, George Jetson, Fred Flintstone, Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound.\n\nNovelist William Faulkner contributed to the screenplay of MILDRED PIERCE (1945), but his work – including a scene where Butterfly McQueen was to sing a gospel song – never reached the screen.\n\nHarry and Jack split over ideology during the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings of 1947, Jack currying favor with the committee by promising to dig out ideological \"termites\" while Harry refused to believe that any of his artists were a threat to America.\n\nThe premiere of LIFE WITH FATHER (1947) was held at the Lakewood Theater in Skowhegan, Maine, where the long-running Broadway hit play upon which it was based was given its first try-out eight years earlier.\n\nThe exterior shots of the hurricane in KEY LARGO (1948) were stock footage, also used in WB's NIGHT UNTO NIGHT with Ronald Reagan released a year later.\n\nJane Wyman's Academy Award® acceptance speech for her role as a mute in WB's JOHNNY BELINDA (1948) was the shortest on record at the time: \"I won this award by keeping my mouth shut, and I think I'll do it again.\"\n\nSelected angles from Robert Walker's death scene in WB'S STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (1951) were interpolated into Paramount's MY SON JOHN (1952), in which his character also died at the end. Walker had died of an allergic reaction to a drug before the second film had wrapped.\n\nNine members of the original Broadway cast of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE (1951) re-created their roles for the WB film. \"Stella, hey Stella!\" is the 45th top movie quote of all time on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list."
