        "text": "In Europe before the advent of sound, a most interesting melange of women directors was operating. In Czechloslovakia, the stage actress Zet Molas disavowed the theater and experimented with forms otherwise unseen in that country before Gustav Machaty’s Ecstasy. Thea Cervankova concentrated on adapting established Czech novels and national plays; and Hedvika Raabeova, barely ten years after the formation of a Czech film industry, made a solitary short, Ada, in 1919.\n\nIn Sweden, Anna Hoffman-Uddgren made six films over a two year span (1910-1911), including an early adaptation of Strindberg’s Miss Julie, and became the second woman director in film history. Eight years later Pauline Brunius began a series of short comedies which were most often seen in theaters as short subjects with the major works of Stiller and Sjostrom.\n\nThe French actress and producer, Marie-Louise Iribe, had made Jacques Feyder’s L’Atlantide before coming to America for a short time in 1922. Returning to France, she resumed her producing role, and in 1928 she directed one of the oddities of the silent French cinema, Hara-Kiri, the story of a French woman who mourns the death of her Japanese lover by contemplating harakiri, only to resort to suicide by shooting beside her lover’s coffin. With her film, L’ami Fritz, in 1918, Suzanne Devoyod embarked on an effort to gain entry into American as well as French directors’ circles, but financiers would not oblige her, and it remained her only directorial effort. Marie Epstein, Jean Epstein’s wife, co-directed four films with Jean Benoit-Levy including the celebrated La Mater Nelle. Her last film, La Grande Esperance, was a documentary on the peaceful uses of atomic energy.\n\nIn Great Britain, three women directors made early appearances. Dinah Shurey directed Last Port in 1929. Mary Field, who directed documentaries as early as the mid-Twenties, headed numerous important instructional and children’s films organizations in the government, and after 1944 she directed Rank’s Children’s Film Division. The British novelist, Elinor Glyn, made two feature films in 1930, Knowing Men and The Price of Things, and stalwartly represented a primary link between the British cinema and early 20th-century English Romantic literatures. Her films, like her novels, were irreverent, witty, and easily forgotten.\n\nAimee Navarra’s Coeurs Belges (1918) was a short nationalistic film concerning the devestation of the war, and appears to be the earliest effort by a woman in Belgium, while in Spain the only film known to be directed by a woman was The Wild Cat, a short made by Rosario Pi in 1936. In Argentina, there was Renee Oro, who filmed the prize winning Argentina around 1930.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, where relatively large numbers of women worked in the post-Revolution film industry, Margarita Barskaya wrote and directed a popular children’s film, Torn Shoes. The Brumberg sisters, pioneer animators, began their forty-five year collaboration in 1929 with The Young Samoyed. Olga Chekhov (the playwright’s niece) was a comedienne who roamed Europe during the Twenties appearing in many films of established directors, including Rene Clair’s The Italian Straw Hat. In London, she established her own small production company and directed two comedies before returning to acting the following year.\n\nOlga Preobrazhenskaya was an important actress in the Czarist cinema before directing her first film in 1915. In lieu of the structure of the Russian and Soviet film industries, her trial run at directing was tentative and liable to refusal the next time around, but her three films for children were appreciated. In 1927 she made her masterpiece, Women of Ryazan, a rural tale of moral delicacy, in which pre-Kuleshovian notions of narrative were revived and stood their final ground in the face of an altered Soviet cinema.\n\nEsther Shub, on the other hand, was an innovator, if not the founder, of an entire sub-genre: the compilation film. A film editor by profession, she embarked on the idea of recreating an historical film document of the decline of the Czarist regime from newsreel footage hitherto scattered around the museums and warehouses of Moscow. With considerable difficulty, she gained permission to undergo the project as an official showpiece of the tenth anniversary of the February Revolution. This mammoth undertaking resulted in The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty and, shortly thereafter, The Great Road, which was commissioned for the anniversary of the October Revolution. For the first time, films of re-creation, representation and emotion were created from recorded glimpses of actual events.\n\nShub’s influence on the documentary film was central. By way of the grammatical analogy, it is evident that Robert Flaherty directed the viewer into the personal arena of first-person subjectivity, Lumiere’s scenes remain remote accounts—third-person objectivity—and Shub’s compilation films were meant to involve the viewer with scenes of himself: the viewer and the viewed, one in the same. Her films were not necessarily accurate, nor were they designed for any audience other than a contemporary one. But her influence on theatrical newsreels, propaganda films and the mass of television programming based on the compilation idea is beyond estimation.\n\nA large proportion of women active in filmmaking before the Sixties worked in areas other than the live-action, feature- length narrative film. Although the specific reasons for this differ from one individual to the other, the general pattern is attributable to difficulties women have had in gaining access to the strings of economic power, or, as in many cases where national film industries exist, to the strings of bureaucratic power. Even Leni Riefenstahl, perhaps the greatest documentarist in the history of the cinema, was personally chosen and sanctioned by Hitler primarily because her athleticism and beauty epitomized his idea of the new German, and only secondarily on the basis of her work in films prior to their meeting. Julia Solntseva, although she came to evoke a milder style of her own in later years, wrestled through her first twenty years in the cinema on the coattails of her director-husband, Alexander Dovzhenko. Dozens of other wifely collaborators did the same. More subtle, although no less important, obstacles lay in the way of women hoping to direct or take charge of productions: the myth of the heavy camera; the myth of the female “General” on the set; the myth of male intelligence; and the fact of little or no precedent.\n\nThus we find in most major countries considerable numbers of women making animated films, some of whom were quite important. The Austrian Lotte Reiniger was the pioneer-creator of the animated silhouette film. Her films were quaint, neat and often recreated famous tales and myths for children. For fifty years, she has been the undisputed master of her genre. Hermina Tyrlova, who along with JiriTrnka brought fame and respect to the Czechoslovak puppet film, began her career in the Twenties. Her films were also made for audiences of children. Joy Batchelor is one half of the most successful animation team in the world. Halas and Batchelor’s more personal films are hard to analyze collectively, but this collaboration has been responsible for a wide variety of technical innovations. Yvonne Andersen established her niche with the founding in 1954 of a school in Lexington, Massachusetts, for teaching film animation to children. Under her supervision, the students have made hundreds of short films, many of them shown at festivals around the world. Claire Parker, an American expatriate in France, has collaborated for more than thirty years on most of the pin-animation films of Alexander Alexe ieff. Mary Ellen Bute experimented with abstract forms of animation dating from the mid-Thirties.\n\nExperimenting with new forms of live-action films has been perhaps the most durable impression women filmmakers have made, up to now at least, on the cinema. The surrealist film, for example, found its first consummate expression in Germaine Dulac’s La coquille et le clergyman, whose script by Antonin Artaud created such tension with Dulac’s directorial sensitivities that the viewer was left shattered by the visual meeting of a high-and-low-pressure collision. Dulac, an active feminist, was a pivotal figure in the avant-garde movement of France in the Twenties, among whose lasting testaments was a cinema of introspection in which reason was held to be man ‘s last hope.\n\nIn America, Maya Deren, whose life and films have been described eloquently elsewhere, opened the door to the New American Cinema, followed by Sarah Arledge, Helen Levitt, Shirley Clarke, Marie Menken, and later many others. Today, that small door has long since been broken down, and the flood gates that closed opportunity to women filmmakers appear secure no more.\n\n****\n\nWomen filmmakers who fit into the following groups have been omitted from these filmographies: those who began making short or independent films after 1964; those who have worked solely in either television or industrial film production; and some thirty documentarists (mainly from Eastern Europe) who have been cut for reasons of space. Beyond these limitations, I have tried to list all women film directors. The directors’ writing and acting credits are included except in the case of films directed by others; their producing, editing, cinematographic and other credits are not included. Other acting credits of well-known or pertinent performers are given, as well as the distributors of the commercial American films.\n\nGrateful acknowledgment is made to Annette Michelson, Regina McShane, and the members of the Seminar on Women in Film, New York University; to Jonas Mekas and the staff of Anthology Film Archives; and to the staffs of the New York Public Library’s Theatre Collection and the Museum of Modern Art’s Department of Film. –Richard Henshaw\n\nKEY:\n\nd = directed\n\nco-d = co-directed\n\nscr = screenwriter\n\nco-scr = co-screenwriter\n\nOriginal production company are occasionally abbreviated but only after being used completely in that entry.\n\nIRINA AKTASHEVA Bulgaria 1965 Monday Morning co-d: Hristo Piskov.\n\nYVONNE ANDERSEN USA Founded Yellow Ball workshop in 1954 and since has supervised hundreds of animated films made by children.\n\nMARY ANDJAPARIDZE USSR 1960 Aniuta also scr.\n\nSARAH ARLEDGE USA 1947 Introspection (short).\n\nDOROTHY ARZNER USA (1900- ) 1927 Fashions For Women Paramount cast: Esther Ralston; 1927 Ten Modern Commandments Par cast: Esther Ralston; Get Your Man Par cast: Clara Bow; 1928 Manhattan Cocktail Par cast: Nancy Carroll; 1929 Wild Party Par cast: Clara Bow, Fredric March; 1930 Sarah and Son Par cast: Ruth Chatterton, Fredric March; Paramount On Parade Par (one of ten directors) all-star cast; Anybody’s Woman Par cast: Ruth Chatterton, Clive Brook; 1931 Honor Among Lovers Par cast: Claudette Colbert, Fredric March; Working Girls Par cast: Paul Lukas, Frances Dee; 1932 Merrily We Go to Hell Par cast: Sylvia Sidney, Fredric March; 1933 Christopher Strong RKO cast: Katharine Hepburn, Colin Clive; 1934 Nana United Artists cast: Anna Sten; 1936 Craig’s Wife Columbia cast: Rosalind Russell; 1937 The Bride Wore Red MGM cast: Joan Crawford, Franchot Tone; 1940 Dance Girl Dance RKO cast: Maureen O’Hara, Louis Hayward; 1943 First Comes Courage Columbia cast: Merle Oberon, Brian Aherne; 1944 training films for Women’s Army Corps.\n\nJACQUELINE AUDRY France (1908- ) 1943 Les Chevaux du Vorcors (short); 1945 Les Malheurs de Sophie; 1948 Sombre Dimanche; 1949 Gigi cast: Daniele Delorme; 1950 Minne, I’ingenue libertine cast: Daniele Delorme; 1951 Olivia [Pit of Loneliness] cast: Edwige Feuillere, Simone Simon; 1952 La Caroque Blonde; 1954 Huis Clos cast: Arletty; 1956 Mitsou ou Comment l’Esprit Vient aux Filles; 1957 La Garçonne; 1958 C’est la Faute d’Adam; 1959 L’Ecole des Cocottes [Six Easy Lessons] cast: Dany Robin ; 1960 Le Secret du Chevalier d’Eon; 1962 Les Petits Matins [Girl On The Road]; 1963 Cadavres en Vacances; 1966 Fruits Amers; 1970 Lis de Mer.\n\nRUTH ANN BALDWIN USA 1915 The Black Page Universal (short); The Double Deal in the Park U (short) also scr; An Arrangement With Fate U (short) also scr; 1916 The Recoiling Vengeance U also scr; 1917 The Butterfly U also scr; Is Money All?
