        "text": "Clothes Make the Character: The Role of Wardrobe in Early Motion Pictures by Jeff Kurtti\n\nThis link opens in a new window\n\nISBN: 1476642168\n\n\"The clothes make the man\" (or woman). This is especially true in early Hollywood silent films where a character's appearance could show an immense number of different things about the characters. For example, Theda Bara's role in A Fool There Was (1915) was known for her revealing clothing, seductive appearance, and being the first \"Vamp.\" In these films, wardrobe and costume design played a larger role in the film than that of modern movies. The character's clothes told the audience who they were and what their role was in the movie. In this in-depth analysis of the use of clothing in character design, the author provides examples and explanations about noteworthy characters who used their appearance to further their fame in early Hollywood films.\n\nDressed: A Century of Hollywood Costume Design by Deborah Nadoolman Landis; Deborah N. Landis\n\nISBN: 9780060816506\n\nIn Dressed: A Century of Hollywood Costume Design, Academy Award-nominated costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis showcases one hundred years of Hollywood's most tantalizing costumes and the characters they helped bring to life.

Along the way she also provides and eye-opening, behind-the-scenes look at the evolution of the costume designer's art, from its emergence as a key element of cinematic collaboration to its limitless future in the era of CGI.\n\nFashion in Fiction: Text and Clothing in Literature, Film, and Television by Peter McNeil (Editor); Vicki Karaminas (Editor); Catherine Cole (Editor)\n\nThis link opens in a new window\n\nISBN: 9781847883575\n\nThe book provides a groundbreaking examination of the interconnected worlds of fashion and words, providing perspectives from socio-cultural, historical and theoretical readings of fashion and text-based communication.Covering a variety of genres and periods, Fashion in Fiction analyses fashion's role within a range of creative media, exploring the many ways that dress communicates, disrupts and modulates meaning across different cultures and contexts.\n\nFilmcraft by Deborah Nadoolman Landis\n\nThis link opens in a new window\n\nISBN: 0240818679\n\nActors often say they only really assume the identity of their character when they have donned the costumes painstakingly created for them by the costume designer. In this volume of the FilmCraft series of books, sixteen of the world's leading costume designers come together to share their inspiration and knowledge with the reader. They provide insights into the challenges of envisioning a character, working with budgets, and collaborating with production designers, actors and directors.

By the 1910s, the moving image was an integral part of everyday life and communicated fascinating, but as yet un-investigated, ideas and ideals about fashionable dress.\n\nTextiles on Film by Becky Peterson\n\nISBN: 9781350026551\n\nThe imagined worlds of the cinematic mise-en-scène are rich with textiles: fabrics drape over sets, serve as props, and develop mood and character as dress and décor. A much-needed examination of the cultural and emotional impact of textiles as mediated through cinematic technology, Textiles on Film broadens our understanding of the dynamic relationship between fabric and film.\n\nThe Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Film and Television Costume Design, Volume 1: Themes and Issues by Deborah Nadoolman Landis (General Editor)\n\nThis link opens in a new window\n\nCall Number: Available Online\n\nISBN: 9781474207867\n\nThe first volume of The Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Film and Television Costume Design examines the process of costume design from script to screen, and comprises articles on the history of costume design, both in film and television, on international modes of production, on key genres and themes, and on costume’s contribution to global popular culture.

But in the audience, we know little (and think less) about the enormous efforts of those involved in bringing an opera to life--by the stagehands who shift scenery, the scenic artists who create beautiful backdrops, the electricians who focus the spotlights, and the stage manager who calls them and the singers to their places during the performance. The first comprehensive history of the behind-the-scenes world of opera production and staging, From the Score to the Stage follows the evolution of visual style and set design in continental Europe from its birth in the seventeenth century up to today.\n\nHistory of the Theatre Costume Business by Triffin Morris; Gregory Morris; Rachel Pollock\n\nISBN: 9781138484306\n\nA History of the Theatre Costume Business is the first-ever comprehensive book on the subject, as related by award-winning actors and designers, and first hand by the drapers, tailors, and craftspeople who make the clothes that dazzle on stage.

She argues that in the period 1820-1920, as part of the larger project of Modernism across the artistic and cultural field, the functions of \"clothing\" and \"costume\" diverged. Onstage apparel took on a more specific semiotic task, acting as a fresh channel for the flow of information between the performer, the literary text, and the spectator. This book traces how five kinds of artists - directors, performers, writers, couturiers, and painters - made key contributions to this new model of costume design.\n\nTheatrical Costume, Masks, Make-Up and Wigs by Sidney Jackson Jowers\n\nISBN: 9780415247740\n\nThis is the first bibliography in its field, based on first-hand collations of the actual articles.

This Academy publication celebrates the work of these consummate artists and includes costumes designed for recent films of all genres, with each costume communicating the essence of the character for whom it was designed.\n\nCreating the Illusion: A Fashionable History of Hollywood Costume Designers by Jay Jorgensen; Donald L. Scoggins; Ali MacGraw (Foreword by); Turner Classic Movies\n\nISBN: 9780762456611\n\nFor more than a century, costume designers have left indelible impressions on moviegoers' minds. Yet until now, so little has been known about the designers themselves and their work to complement and enrich stories through fashion.

A groundbreaking work on American fashion designer Bonnie Cashin, acclaimed for inventing sportswear, and one of the most imitated designers of all time.\n\nBonnie Cashin: Fashion and costume design ca. 1923–1985 by Lake, Stephanie\n\nDissertation--Ph.D; Bard College, 2009\n\nThis dissertation examines the life and career of American fashion and film costume designer Bonnie Cashin (1907–2000). Although Cashin is best known as a pioneer of American sportswear and for \"modern\" ready-to-wear fashion designs after 1950, this dissertation considers the totality of her work. It begins with her childhood dressmaking \"apprenticeship\" and then considers Cashin's careers in dance and film costume design as well as fashion design and evaluates her role as an advocate and critic of the fashion industry from the 1950s until her death in 2000.\n\nBonnie Cashin: Connecting the designer to the designed garment through a material culture analysis of five examples of her work, 1962–1975 by Bute, Martha Jane\n\nDissertation--M.S.; Iowa State University, 2007\n\nThis thesis examined a group of five Bonnie Cashin-designed showroom and runway garments and other design- and marketing-related materials (sketches, patterns, and press essays) in the Textiles and Clothing Museum (TCM) at Iowa State University. Her manufacturer, Philip Sills, donated these materials. Cashin was an American ready-to-wear fashion designer well-known for her use of leather, suede, textured fabrics, and hardware-style closures. The recognizable \"Cashin look\" was layered using ponchos, capes, coats, and other garments such as jumpsuits that all incorporated leather or suede as trim or major design and structural elements. The materials analyzed in this study are typical of Cashin's work with Sills and date from 1962 to 1975. Research goals were to: (1) connect these garments to Cashin's design process and philosophy; (2) understand the Sills manufacturing process; (3) understand Cashin's role in marketing such pieces; and (4) determine if these artifacts were produced commercially.\n\nEdith Head by Jay Jorgensen\n\nISBN: 9780762438051\n\nAll About Eve. Funny Face. Sunset Blvd. Rear Window. Sabrina. A Place in the Sun. The Ten Commandments. Scores of iconic films of the last century had one thing in common: costume designer Edith Head (1897-1981). She racked up an unprecedented 35 Oscar nods and 400 film credits over the course of a fifty-year career. Never before has the account of Hollywood's most influential designer been so thoroughly revealed,because never before have the Edith Head Archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences been tapped. This unprecedented access allows this book to be a one-of-a-kind survey, bringing together a spectacular collection of rare and never-before-seen sketches, costume test shots, behind-the- scenes photos, and ephemera.\n\nEdith Head by David Chierichetti\n\nISBN: 9780060567408\n\nEdith Head is widely considered the most important figure in the history of Hollywood costume design. Her career spanned nearly half a century and included such classic films as Rear Window and Sunset Boulevard. Her private life and professional achievements have been the subject of speculation since she rose to the top in the late 1940s. Ruthlessly competitive and intensely secretive, Head had few close friends and many detractors. Her longtime friend, protégé, and confidant David Chierichetti offers a privileged glimpse into the personality behind the famously impenetrable \"schoolmarm\" façade and a comprehensive account of her creative process. With more than 150 images -- including family snapshots, sketches, and studio portraits of the stars and roles she helped to create, Edith Head is a fresh and vital portrait of the designer, as well as of the era she epitomizes."
