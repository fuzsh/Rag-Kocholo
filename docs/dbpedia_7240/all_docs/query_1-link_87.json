        "text": "Connecting Communities + Cultures:The Vital Role of Libraries, Archives, and Museums in the Arts\n\nLibraries, archives and museums are vital hubs of activity that collect, exhibit, and make available heritage materials, facilitate education and community-building, and function as keepers of public memory. This two-day symposium as part of TIFFâs Reel Heritage initiative offers professional development sessions for emerging librarians, archivists, and students looking to enter the field.\n\nThis event is supported by the Government of Canada and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. November 20 â November 21, 2017\n\nUNESCO World Day for Audiovisual Heritage\n\nTo mark the UNESCO World Day for Audiovisual Heritage, an annual event which aims to raise awareness of the need for film preservation and the conservation of our audiovisual heritage, we are proud to present a free screening of this exquisite IB Technicolor print of Alfred Hitchcockâs classic thriller Rear Window on October 25.

This acquisition was made possible by a financial donation from Robert Goodwin - a long time TIFF member and Allan King enthusiast. We are grateful for Robert's generosity, about which he said: \"TIFF and especially the TIFF Bell Lightbox is the best thing that ever happened to Toronto, in my books. I'm delighted to be able to honour Alan King in my own small wayâ.\"\n\nFilm Reference Library hosts Doors Open Toronto!\n\nJoin us May 28 + 29 for a behind-the-scenes tour of the Library, a centre for film scholarship that provides resources on all aspects of filmmaking to researchers, students, film makers and film lovers.
