        "text": "An important though not that well known Soviet director. His two best-known works are The Letyat Zhuravii / The Cranes are Flying (1957), which shared the Best Picture Award at Cannes 1958: and Soy Cuba / I am Cuba (1963), which presents a triptych of stories of Cuba before and during the revolutionary civil war. There have been two opportunities in recent years to see more of his film work. In 2004 the Göteborg Film Festival presented a selection of his films. This welcome opportunity was slightly arduous for linguistically limited English fans, as the films were screened in Russian with Swedish subtitles.\n\nThen in 2010 Il Giornate del Cinema Muto presented all the surviving silent film work of Kalatozov, including those on which he worked as cinematographer. He emerges from this fuller picture as an extremely gifted stylist, whose approach to film is rather poetic. In fact, it struck me that whilst there are major differences there is a similar quality to the films of Sergei Paradjanov. Both were Georgian artists: both had problems with the Soviet authorities: and in both sets of films emotional imagery takes precedence over narrative and commentary.\n\nKalatazov was born Mikhail Konstantinovich Kalatozishvili in Tiflis (Tibilisi) in 1903. He entered the Georgian sector of the young Soviet film industry in 1925 at the Goskinprom Studios. He worked as an actor, cutter and cameraman before graduating to direction. He was a member of the Georgian avant-garde of the period and worked at different times with innovators like Lev Kuleshov, Esther Shub and Sergei Tretyakov.\n\nHis command and manipulation of the film camera is what one first notices in his work, including on the films on which he worked as cinematographer. Two of these were screened at Pordenone: Giuli (1927, director Lev Push): and Boshuri Siskhli / Gypsy Blood, 1928, (director Lev Push).\n\nIn the films that he directed, especially during the silent period, the camera work is almost delirious and the images throb with emotion. His two major works from this early period are Jim Shuante / Salt for Svanetia (1930), formally a documentary about a remote area of the Caucasus. However, the film focuses on traditional rituals and mythic representations of customs that had probably already died out. Only in the final reel does it address the impact of Soviet socialist plans. And the other film is Lursmani Cheqmashi / Nail in the Boot (1931) which is an overt propaganda film. However, once again Kalatazov is really interested in the poetic image and tale. The first part of the film depicts a battle shot in noir style and the desperate and unsuccessful journey for help by a soldier. In the second part a military court martial provides the setting for overt political comment. In both cases Kalatazov expended more energy on the poetic qualities of the film than on the political aspects. This resulted in criticism by the cultural authorities, and also by the military authorities on the second film. This was the period when ‘socialist realism’ was the required form for films, and Kalatazov’s work was as far from such a style of filmmaking as one could possibly get.\n\nNail in the Boot was banned and Kalatazov was transferred to administrative duties. He did not direct films again until the 1939. I have not yet been able to see the nine films he directed up until 1956. The Cranes are Flying in that year shows has retained both his command of the medium and his poetic feelings. The film tells the story of two lovers separated by the great Nazi-Soviet conflict. The film’s cinematography is powerful and very unusual for the period in Soviet cinema. I rather felt that there is some influence here on Tarkovsky.\n\nThe Unmailed Letter (1960) is one of the films I tried to follow in Russian and Swedish. It follows an expedition to Siberia, which ends disastrously. The film has all the fevered camerawork that Kalatazov delivered in his silent films. I am Cuba has grown in reputation in recent years, and is an important record of a particular moment in the Cuban revolution. It still expended as much attention on the poetic aspects of the struggle and the Cubans were less impressed with the film. His final film, The Red Tent / La Tenda Rossa (1971) was a Soviet/Italian co-production about an ill-fated polar expedition. Unfortunately it is slow, wooden and not really a memorable last movie.\n\nStills courtesy of Gosfilmomond and Il Giornate del Cinema Muto.\n\nThe Cranes are Flying and Soy Cuba are both available on DVD.\n\nUSSR 1925. Black and white, silent with musical accompaniment, 1337 metres / 70 minutes.\n\nUK film fans have a fresh chance to enjoy one of the key films of cinema history. Moreover it comes in a new restoration which is the closest yet to that seen at the premiere in Moscow in December 1925. This may seem odd for a film that is widely screened, studied and debated. However, even in an industry that often shows a scant regard for the intentions of the filmmakers, Potemkin has had a very erratic history. Ennio Patalas of the Filmmuseum Berlin [Deutsche Kinemathek), the lead archivist in this restoration had detailed many of the cuts, changes and worse in his The Odyssey of the Battleship. (Journal of Film Preservation, 2005).\n\nThe Soviet Production Company Goskino sold the original negative to the German left-wing distributor Prometheus in 1926. The film was then censored by the German authorities, cuts included a justifiably famous shot, ‘Close-up of the child covered in blood and his feet, with people running over them and then his head, with a woman stepping on it …’. When the negative was returned to the Soviet Union, possibly before, possibly after the war, the cuts remained. Soviet censors did more damage in the 1930s, removing [amongst other frames] the opening quotation, originally from the now disgraced Leon Trotsky. Hollywood did worse in the 1940s producing a bowdlerised version, Seeds of Freedom (1943) in which the shortened original film was a flashback by an ex-sailor / partisan fighting the German invaders. Then demonstrating Godard’s apt comment about the ‘Hollywood – Mosfilm axis’, in 1949 the Soviet authorities produced a sound version, partly re-edited, including changing the order of the images in the famous Odessa Steps sequence. Other versions step-printed the original and altered the aspect ratio of the frames. Clearly it remained a powerful and political viewing. But Eisenstein’s very specific treatment of image and montage was frequently diluted.\n\nPatalas and his colleagues have meticulously researched surviving prints, contemporary material on the film and records of the different versions in different archives. They have inserted accurate titles, replaced missing frames and sequences, and carefully combined the best prints to produce this version. It is though still slightly shorter than the original version.\n\nA key element in this process is a copy of the version that was shown at the London Film Society in 1927. This print had come directly from Moscow. It had some cuts but was relatively complete: though the English title cards were not always accurate in their translation. Life was complicated for the restorers because another version arrived in the UK in 1927, but from Berlin thus having suffered the scissors of the German censors. Both have been used in the Restoration.\n\nThe restorer have also taken into account the famous score produced for the German release by Edmund Meisel. Apparently the Moscow premiere was accompanied by a medley of music, and performed by an orchestra unfamiliar with the film. Meisel’s score was a serious engagement with the film and its political drama. In fact, the music was so successful that on one occasion the German authorities allowed the film to be screened but banned the music.\n\nThere have now been a number of performances with a live orchestra accompanying the film. I was fortunate to see and hear this at the Giornate del Cinema Muto, with the accompaniment by Günther Buchwald. Now the British Film Institute is distributing this version of the film in a High Definition digital print. This enables them to provide the Meisel score in a recorded accompaniment. I would expect that Eisenstein’s film would look good in this format, as there are few of the special effects that are over-emphasised by the sharper edges of digital. However, it does create a further problem, the film’s running speed.\n\nThe screening at the Giornate was 18 frames per second [fps] and ran for seventy minutes. The BFI release also runs for 70m minutes but will be on digital projectors running at 24 fps. I assume that the version has been adapted on a computer, which is rather similar to the now disused step-printing. This can produce a slight ghosting effect on the image. I think this is quite likely for the Potemkin print given that there are a number of shots in the film that are only a few frames and run for only part of a second. I am inclined to think that Eisenstein would not be completely happy with this. Patalas records that in 1929 in London, Meisel had it [the film] projected at a slower speed [to fit his music] a reason for the cooling of relations between himself and Eisenstein.’ Given what an experience the film is, this is not a reason to miss seeing the film [or seeing it again].\n\nApart from any other reasons it has been my experience in teaching that more people have seen the famous Odessa Steps sequence than have seen the whole film. As impressive and powerful as this sequence is, it makes far sense dramatic and political sense as part of the whole film. And the Patalas restoration means that effectively we are seeing the film in a new form and possibly in a new way. I have actually seen quite few of the different versions – memorably one print where only two of the three lions at the end of the Odessa Steps were to be seen. Here we have the radical cinematic form, the emotional resonance of the revolution, and the complexities of the film’s propaganda.\n\n*************************************\n\nWatching the restoration in the digital release was a real pleasure. Eighty years on Eisenstein’s film stands the test of time, and of a radically changed social and political context. In this fuller version the film displays a dynamic drive coupled with a coherent but fairly complex narrative. Even after numerous previous viewing new aspects struck me. One particular sequence is near the start of Act V. There are shots of low rolling waves near a coastline. This appears to refer us back to the opening stormy sea, now presented in its original form. A new phase of the struggle is signalled.\n\nThe digital version looked very good, though the sharper edges of the format seemed to make the grain of the film more obvious. The visual aspect confirms how important was the contribution of Eduard Tissé to this [and other films by Eisenstein]. In particular, whilst one is struck by the editing and tempo of the Odessa Steps sequence, it is also full of stunning camera shots. There are several wide shots of the steps with the civilian crowd in full flight from the murderous soldiers. Even after eighty years I can think of few films with such dramatic images.\n\nThe accompanying score was excellent. It had to be rearranged as Meisel original score was to composed to accompany the censored and therefore somewhat shorter version. The rearrangement was extremely well done and the music makes a major contribution to the impact of the film.\n\nThere were slight weaknesses. The digital version runs at 24 fps, whereas the original probably ran at 18 fps. It appears that the method used to adjust the difference in speeds was a form of computerised ‘step-printing’, – inserting extra frames every so often. Step printing usually inserted an extra frame every three – this electronic system apparently inserts every seven or eight frames. The slight drawback is that the film has a number of camera shots that are less than this. I did think at one or two places that the image ran rather fast. There were several points where I felt this, in the Odessa Steps sequence, and also with the appearance of the three lions that follows that sequence.\n\nBut it was still a great film to see again – looking and sounding great. I did check David Thomson’s book shortly before the screening. He does not like it at all. Perversely, that is probably unintended praise.\n\nStills provided by Il Giornate del Cinema Muto, courtesy of the British Film Institute\n\nUSSR 1928.\n\nDirected by Boris Barnet. Produced at the Mezhrapom-Rus Studio, the most commercial of the Soviet production companies.\n\nRunning 66 minutes at 24 fps: unfortunately reel five is missing.\n\nScreened as part of The Canon Revisited at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto 2009.\n\nAs the Festival catalogue points out the film does not have the status of a ‘classic’ as it is extremely difficult to see. Apparently it is only available on DVD in France. Hopefully the warm reception at the Giornate will motivate someone to remedy this sad state of affairs.\n\nThe House on Trubnaya Square is that rare feature, a montage comedy. It is marvellously funny and makes exemplary use of Soviet montage techniques. Barnet had worked, as an assistant director on Lev Kuleshov’s The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (Neobychainiye priklucheniya Mistera Vesta v stranye bolshevikov, 1924), and was apparently also, for a time, a member of DzigaVertov’s ‘workshop’. His favoured genre appears to have been comedy.\n\n“Speaking generally about my attitude towards cinema, I like comedy best of all. I like to insert amusing scenes into dramas and dramatic scenes into comedies, but of course it’s all a matter of proportion.\n\nWith a few obvious exceptions, all my films, for better or worse, deal with contemporary life and its problems. When I have an option, I have always chosen contemporary subjects, even though it is not always easy to tackle these.” [Interview in Eisenschitz, 1991].\n\nThe interweaving of the comic and dramatic can be seen in this feature film. Barnet continued working as a director, and sometime actor, in the Soviet industry into the 1960s. The House on Trubnaya Square also enjoyed the services of a team of four scriptwriters, an unusually large number for the period and suggestive of concerns over content. However, according to an article by Bernard Eisenschitz [Eisenschitz, 1991] there seems to have been little in common between a published script and the actual finished film.\n\nYuri Tsivian set the scene for this film in the Festival Catalogue:\n\n“There exists a sad story used more than once in Russian silent films and in Russia’s soulful prose. A young peasant woman comes to the city carrying all she has – a goose or a duck in a basket. Overwhelmed by the crowd and frightened by the trams, she spends the night in a park only to be spotted by a brothel owner, or, if in luck, to find a low-wage job as a nurse or maid in a rich man’s house. In the next reel her employer or his son seduces the peasant girl, and, with a baby on her hands, she returns to her village, where no one is willing to take her back.”\n\nAs Tsivian points out this film apparently revisits the genre, but then offers an unexpected twist.\n\nThe opening introduces the House on Trubnaya: presented round a central staircase with various floors and flats. This set provides a site for comedy and satire, with some inventive tracks and tilts up and down its length. Two Intertitles inform us, ‘The City sleeps’. And ‘The City wakens’, accompanied by shots of urban activity. [This opening bears some resemblance to that of Vertov’s Man With a Movie Camera / Chelovek s kinoapparatom, 1929]. Then we meet the apparently stereotypical village heroine, Parasha (Vera Maretskaia), who has arrived in Moscow laden with all her belongings, including a duck. Bewildered and lost she wanders into the path of an oncoming tram. At this point Barnet introduces a freeze frame, and an Intertitle addresses the audience, ‘How Parasha came to be in Moscow?’\n\nThe film proceeds to fill out the story. Parasha has come to Moscow to seek her uncle but finds he has moved. Fortunately the driver of the tram, Semyon [Vladimir Batalov], is from her village. This is how Parasha comes to reside at Trubnaya Square. Here she works as a maid for the hairdresser Golikov [Vladimir Fogel]. Golikov is an example of an entrepreneur who exploits his servants: Parasha is the latest in a line of serving girls who endure service. Golikov is clearly a satire on the Nepmen, entrepreneurs who were able to trade and profit in the period of the New Economic Policy.\n\nThe films also satirises the less than utopian behaviour of the workers in the Trubnaya flats. The staircase provides the site for a continuing battle between Soviet order and individualist fecklessness. The feckless behaviour includes dumping rubbish and using the landings for wood chopping. The battle against this individualist disorder is led by Fenia (Ada Voitsik), also a union organiser. She is one of the alternative model proletarians, the citizens of the new Soviet world. The other lead model is the driver Semyon, a union member. Fenia befriends Parasha and encourages her to demand her entitlements.\n\nClass contradictions come to a head at certain points in the narrative. First, there is a revolutionary dramatic performance at the workers’ club. [This is a rare example of such a club featuring in a Soviet film]. The topic is the Storming of the Bastille [during the French Revolution, a harbinger of that which had occurred in Russia in 1917]. Thanks to an excess of alcohol by one of the performers Golikov has to take the stage as a general leading the reaction. His violent stage actions are too much for Parasha who rushes from the audience to join in on stage and attack his reactionary character.\n\nThe later event is the elections to the Moscow Soviet. Parasha attends an election meeting with her friend Fenia. Part of these events occur in the missing reel. A resident at the Square, Marina, hears what she thinks is Parasha’s name read out in the election results. On hearing the news the other residents prepare to welcome Parasha, including finally cleaning up the staricase. Golikov and his wife, now wishing to impress an elected representative, arrange a dinner party for Parasha, and invite their petit bourgeois friends. Then Golikov discovers the error. When the truth outs Parasha is sacked.\n\nHowever Fenia encourages her to demand unpaid emollients, including untaken holidays and a discharge payment. The film ends with the suggestion of a romance with Semyon as Parasha takes up a proper proletarian job and Golikov receives punishment for the frequent beatings administered to the serving girls. And Fenia celebrates: at last, the Trubnaya House staircase is clean, tidy and in order.\n\nThe film makes use of a variety of techniques, not just editing [as is the case with Soviet montage films generally]. There is the integration of sets and locations; a range in camera use from long shot to close up; tracks, pans and tilts. The variety matches and dramatises the plot, which is an amalgam of speed, change and zany actions.\n\nA number of other films by Barnet are viewed favourably by writers but all remain difficult to see at present. Bernard Eisenschiz article, A fickle man, or portrait of Boris Barnet as a Soviet Director discusses many of these. The article is included in Inside the Film Factory New approaches to Russian and Soviet Cinema, edited by Richard Taylor and Ian Christie, Published by Routledge in 1991.\n\nStills supplied by the Giornate del Cinema Muto, courtesy of Gosfilmofond, Moscow.\n\nLev Kuleshov (Cyrillic spelling Kulešov)\n\nIl Cinema Ritrovato is an Archive Film Festival held annually in the Italian City of Bologna. For a week at the beginning of July about 900 enthusiasts watch films all day in three specialist cinemas. The Festival features both silent and sound films, and each year there are focuses on themes, movements and individual filmmakers. This year one of these was the early Soviet film director Lev Kuleshov. He is famous as the pioneer of what became known as Soviet Montage. Unfortunately, most of the time, his films are not that easy to see.\n\nIn 1929 three of his former students, including Vsevolod Pudovkin, proclaimed:\n\n“We had no cinema before – and now it exists. The rise of cinema began with Kuleshov. Dealing with the questions of cinematic form was what was needed to start it off, and Kuleshov took up this task.” (Il Cinema Ritrovato Festival Catalogue).\n\nKuleshov’s fame and influence was mainly due to a series of famous experiments that he undertook, starting in 1920 in the Kuleshov Workshop. He had already worked in the pre-Revolutionary Russian cinema, with the noted director Eugenia Bauer. He was a fan of Hollywood techniques and very influenced by their [comparatively] rapid editing of the period. Kuleshov wrote extensively about his ideas and experiments. In 1921 he set about creating a non-existent city. (This short sequence was screened at the 1996 Pordenone Silent Film Festival).\n\n”A few years later I made a more complex experiment: we shot a complete scene. Khokhlova and Obolensky acted in it. We filmed then in the following way: Khokhlova is walking along Petrov Street in Moscow near the ‘Mostorg’ street. Obolensky is walking along the embankment of the Moscow River – at a distance of about two miles away. They see each other, smile, and begin to walk towards one another. Their meeting is filmed at the Boulevard Prechistensk. This boulevard is in an entirely different section of the city. They clasp hands, with Gogol’s monument as background and look – at the White House – for at this point, we cut in a segment from an American [USA] film, The White House in Washington.” (Kuleshov on Film, page 52).\n\nKuleshov also experimented with creating a non-existent human being. Then later he filmed probably his most famous experiment, which involved taking a close up of the actor Ivan Mozhukhin and intercutting this shots with [variously] a bowl of soup, a coffin and a child: these were ‘projected to an audience which marvelled at the sensitivity of the acting’. This editing technique has become known as the Kuleshov Effect, when the meaning in a series of shots arises from the actual juxtaposition rather than from the shots themselves. The phrase is often applied to all sorts of examples of editing. However, strictly speaking, Kuleshov’s technique should be distinguished from the effects of parallel editing, where the meaning arises from the narrative context of the film. [This is the type of editing pioneered by D. W. Griffith].\n\nKuleshov was not just concerned with editing, he believed that the key to effective filmmaking was in organisation. He placed great emphasis on the scenario.\n\n“Thus, all work can be reduced to the establishment of various labour processes, since something is done with objects: violating or ordering their commonplace organisation, handling them either rationally or irrationally, the actor-mannequin acts out the processes of labour. The labour process, its mechanics; then, movement; then the ultimate material of cinema. Thus, the work of the scenarist must come down to the expression of a fable through the organisation of people interacting with objects, facilitated by the behaviour of the person and his reflexes.” (Kuleshov on Film, page 145).\n\nHe regarded his films as exercises in achieving the requisite level of organisation. He wrote in 1926,\n\n“It must not be forgotten that up to now the accomplishments of our group should be evaluated only as a bill of fare of Soviet film technique – the skills of our craft – and not as finished films.” (Kuleshov on film, page 141).\n\nHe applied these comments to his first film The Project of Engineer Pright (Proekt Inženera Prajta, 1918). The Festival screened the surviving reels with reconstructed intertitles. The film, shot before the revolution, displayed Kuleshov’s interest in fast Hollywood cutting, and the popular detective genre.\n\nA similar approach was applied to his most famous film, a 1924 silent feature, The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (Neočajnye Priključenija Mistera Vesta V Strane Bol’ševikov). Mr. West is a US capitalist visiting the Soviet Union on business. His head is full of the myths and exaggerations that the western media put out about the ‘seat of the red menace’. His hosts play a joke on these preconceptions; first pretending to have him ‘kidnapped’ by a gang of terrorists, and then ‘rescued’ by the G.P.O. These experiences cure Mr. West of his grotesque preconceptions. The film laid bare the contemporary anti-Soviet propaganda for comedy and satire, and the film was very successful with domestic audiences.\n\nBy the Law (Po Zakonu, 1926) is generally reckoned to be Kuleshov’s finest film. The production was extremely economical: Jan Leyda reckoned it was the cheapest production ever filmed in Russia, (Kino 1960). It is an adaptation of a story by Jack London set in the wilds of Alaska, (The Unexpected). A dispute among a team of gold prospectors leads to murder and then an attempt to impose the ‘Law’ through trial and punishment. The film seems to have a conventional narrative, but eschews the common mainstream aspects of continuity. Audiences will likely notice the angular construction in the staging, and oddities in plot. Kuleshov’s style of filming produced an incredible intensity in performance and presentation. Jan Leyda quotes Sergei Tretyakov:\n\n“The mathematical precision of every gesture and movement contributes to the total effect of each character and episodes. Kuleshov taught in his workshop that the hands, arms and legs are the most expressive parts of the film actor’s body and we can observe their movements create as much of the film’s tension as does the facial expression.” (Kino page 213].\n\nAnd the film was critically praised when it received overseas distribution. The presentation at the Cinema Ritrovato received the accolade of a screening in the Piazza Maggiore. This open-air venue housed several thousand people, with a giant screen, and a live piano accompaniment.\n\nThe Festival also featured Kuleshov’s sound films. The most interesting was The Great Consoler (Velikij Utešitel’, 1933]. This film intertwined three separate stories, taken from the life and writings of the O Henry (the pseudonym of W. S. Porter). A period that Porter spent in jail was intercut with two of his short stories, including the famous Alias Jimmy Valentine. The complexity of the drama and the editing was impressive. The soundtrack was not of great quality, and was affected as we were listening to an English translation from the Russian on earphones. But the most noticeable aspect of the film was it political treatment. Essentially Kuleshov and his colleagues contrasted the conventional closure of Henry’s stories with the real-life events. So in Henry’s story Jimmy Valentine enjoys a happy ending. In the actual film plot variant he does not. The effects of the latter spark the climax in the film, when the death of Valentine produces a violent rebellion among the prison inmates. Given the film was produced during the repression of the 1930s and on the eve of the official promulgation of Socialist realism, this was a brave as well as critical line to take.\n\nIn fact, Kuleshov suffered increasing criticism, notably for ‘errors of formalism’. This label of errant behaviour was one that a number of great soviet artists suffered in this period: notably Eisenstein, who had also studied under Kuleshov. Kuleshov’s film output declined. During the war he worked only for the Sojuzdetfil’m studio, which specialised in films for the young. These films were fairly conventional, but Kuleshov showed a clear aptitude for working with young people. Sibirjaki (1940) has this distinctive plot device: two young pioneers search for a pipe that once belonged to Uncle Joe (Stalin). After the war Kuleshov gave up direction and concentrated on teaching at the State Film School.\n\nOne of the studies of early Soviet film is subtitled ‘Crippled Creative Biographies’ (Master of Soviet Cinema by Herbert Marshall, 1983), which gives a sense of artistic failures and repression. This is rather one-sided. Whilst Kuleshov [like Eisenstein for example] suffered increasing frustrations and restrictions in the 1930s, it was the revolutionary society of the 1920s that gave him opportunities. His writings are extremely critical of the limitation of pre-Soviet cinema: which in fact shared certain conventional approaches with Socialist Realism. Like Eisenstein, Pudovkin, or Mayakovsky in the world of theatre, the revolution offered an opportunity to experiment, overturn conventions, and rethink the values of film.\n\nKuleshov’s legacy is safe in one sense, because his experiments are remembered in the phrase ‘Kuleshov Effect’. The likelihood is now, after the major retrospective in Bologna, that a much greater part of his film output will become available [on DVD at least]. The Festival retrospective was curated by Ekaterina Hohlova, Yuri Tsivian and Nikolaj Izvolov. Ekaterina is the granddaughter of Kuleshov and his wife and star performer, Aleksandra Hohlova. She appeared in many of Kuleshov’s film, and was especially compelling in By the Law and The Great Consoler. She also directed a 1930 film, Saša. This was a tale of a peasant woman struggles in the city, and it is an example of an early feminist film. Unfortunately this major retrospective did not always a positive response The Sight & Sound review of Il Cinema Ritrovato used the somewhat dubious critical terms of ‘pain’ and ‘pleasure’. Pain was Kuleshov and pleasure was Josef Von Sternberg, [featuring a number of films starring Marlene Dietrich]. I am also a fan of Dietrich, but I think the reviewer missed some alternative pleasures. He seems to have made the same mistake as some earlier figures made regarding Hohlova:\n\n“she was mistreated by producers and studio bosses whose male instincts prompted them that more conventional beauties and less eccentric talents might attract more money to the box office.” (Festival Catalogue].\n\nKuleshov’s films do offer some of the pleasures of entertainment films, but they also offer striking characteristics absent from the latter.\n\nThe Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks and By the Law are available on the Internet on NTSC VHS Videos. By the Law is coupled with Chess Fever (Vsevolod Pudovkin, 1925).\n\nKuleshov on Film Writings of Lev Kuleshov. Translated and edited with an introduction by Ronald Levaco. University of California Press, 1974.\n\nKino A History of Russian and Soviet Film by Jan Leyda, Third edition, George Allen & Unwin, 1983\n\nIl Cinema Ritrovato Website is at www.cinetecadibologna.it/cinemaritrovato.htm.\n\n[Thanks to them for providing film stills.]"
