        "text": "Giacomo Puccini\n\nb. Lucca, Toscana, December 22, 1858\n\nd. Brussels, Belgium, November 29, 1924\n\nGiacomo Puccini was born in the Tuscan town of Lucca, where his family had a long musical history. He was a fifth-generation composer. After the death of his father, Giacomo was sent, at the age of five, to study with his uncle, Fortunato Magi, an accomplished organist and teacher. It soon became clear that the young musician was talented, and equally clear that opera was his calling. In 1880, Giacomo entered the Milan Conservatory. In 1882, he produced his first opera, Le villi, for a competition sponsored by the Italian music publisher Sonzogno. Unfortunately, he did not win.\n\nLe villi was not a complete loss for Puccini, though. Giulio Ricordi, the internationally famous head of Sonzogno's major competitor, liked it. In 1884, Ricordi purchased the copyright to Le villi and commissioned a new work from Puccini. The new commission, Edgar, was a disaster, but with Le villi and Edgar done, Puccini had completed his apprenticeship. Of the ten remaining operas he would compose in his lifetime, four would be among the most performed operas of all time—La bohème, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, and Turandot. Five would earn established places in the repertoire—Manon Lescaut, La fanciulla del West, Gianni Schicchi, Il tabarro, and Suor Angelica; while only one, La rondine, would be largely ignored.\n\nAround 1884, Puccini began an affair with Elvira Gemignani, the wife of a Lucchese merchant. She would bear Puccini a son in 1886, but they would not be free to marry until after the death of her husband in 1904.\n\nOn a trip to attend a performance of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg at Bayreuth, Puccini was inspired to write a new opera. When Manon Lescaut premiered in 1893, it was a huge success. Author, playwright, and critic George Bernard Shaw declared Puccini the heir to Giuseppe Verdi. A string of major works followed: La bohème in 1896, Tosca in 1900, and Madama Butterfly in 1904.\n\nA car accident in 1903 left Puccini wheelchair-bound for months, and shortly afterwards he was diagnosed with diabetes. His librettist Giacosa died in 1906 at the age of 58. In 1909, Puccini's maid committed suicide after Elvira accused her of having an affair with the composer. Puccini's renown made this an international news story.\n\nAfter the premiere of La fanciulla del West in 1910, it would be seven years before the composer completed another opera. The next composition was La rondine, Puccini's only operetta. Il trittico, a triple-bill of Il tabarro, Suor Angelica, and Gianni Schicchi, followed in 1918, but the composer was unable to attend the New York premiere.\n\nShortly thereafter, Puccini began work on his final opera, Turandot. He did not live to finish his Chinese fable. Two years after his death, Turandot—completed by the composer Franco Alfano—would premiere under the baton of Puccini's friend, the conductor Arturo Toscanini.\n\nAdapted from a biography originally written by Nicholas Ivor Martin.\n\nGiuseppe Giacosa\n\nb. Colleretto Parella, near Turin, October 21, 1847\n\nd. Colleretto Parella, September 1, 1906\n\nLuigi Illica\n\nb. Castell'Arquato, near Piacenza, May 9, 1857\n\nd. Colombarone, an estate near Castell'Arquato, December 16, 1919\n\nThe story of Madama Butterfly is based on an actual incident involving a young Japanese girl who became pregnant by an Englishman and attempted suicide. John Luther Long used these events as the basis for a novella which first appeared in Century Magazine in 1898. By one account, it was Long’s sister, married to a missionary in Nagasaki, who related the story to him. In the version she had heard, a Japanese geisha wed a U.S. naval officer and was then forsaken by him for an American bride.\n\nDavid Belasco was a well known New York playwright, director, and producer. His dramatization of Long’s Madame Butterfly opened in 1900. That same year, while Puccini was in London to supervise a production of Tosca at Covent Garden, he saw Belasco’s one-act play. Although Puccini knew no English, he was so moved that he wanted to set the work to music at once. Negotiations with Belasco continued for more than a year, however, before a contract was signed and Puccini’s librettists could set to work. Puccini wrote to Giulio Ricordi, his mentor and publisher:\n\n“The more I think about Butterfly, the more excited I become. Ah! If only I had it here with me to work on! I think that instead of one act we should be able to make two out of it, even quite long ones.”\n\nDetermined to find the best writers to work with Puccini, Ricordi had already organized the composer’s partnership with Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa for La bohème. The three men subsequently collaborated on both Tosca and Madama Butterfly.\n\nIllica, Giacosa, and Puccini took on specific tasks. Illica was responsible for how the opera would be divided into acts and for writing the draft of the dialogue. Giacosa then rewrote Illica’s prose into verse. Finally, Puccini set the verse to music.\n\nLuigi Illica began his literary career in Milan in 1879. In 1891 he wrote his most successful play, a comedy in Milanese dialect, L’eridità di Felis. Eight years later he began writing libretti.\n\nGiuseppe Giacosa graduated in law from Turin University and joined his father’s firm in Milan. He left the law profession, transferring into the literary world after the popular success of his one-act verse comedy Una partita a scacchi. From 1888 to 1894 he was chair of literature and dramatic art at the Milan Conservatory.\n\nAdapted from a biography originally written by Ruth Baja Williams"
