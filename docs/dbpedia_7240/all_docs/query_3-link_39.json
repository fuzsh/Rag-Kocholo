        "text": "The Restoration of Johanna Enlists by The Library of Congress\n\nBy 1948, when the Department of Agriculture Film Lab copied the nitrate elements on Johanna Enlists for The Library of Congress, the original negative had already decomposed and the first half of reel three was already missing from the sole surviving nitrate print. There was not much of a concept of “film preservation” at that time; the lab used 16mm film for the copies. In our research, we found that all the existing material on Johanna Enlists comes from that 1948 copy: even the 35mm material, which is a blow-up of the 16mm. And while the film has been available to view for many years, parts of it were copied in “tinting order,” meaning all the shots to be tinted blue, for night scenes, and all the shots tinted amber, for interiors, were spliced together and were placed in proper order later when the prints were made in a process called “positive assembly.” This rendered certain parts of the story unintelligible. The Library’s reconstruction team not only placed all the scenes in their correct order, but also was able to ascertain the tinting for the entire film and has restored that as well.\n\nNext, it was noticed that most, if not all the intertitles had been poorly copied. The titles all feature a very decorative border and, in most cases, that border had been cut off in the copying process. Several members of the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center took the best copy of each of the borders and\n\ncreated new, clean versions with no text. Then, every title card was digitally cleaned up, recomposed with the new border and a slight bit of movement added to match the rest of the film.\n\nThe biggest issue facing the team was the missing portion of reel three. A complete continuity script, which showed exactly how the film was edited together, existed and a storyline for the missing section was constructed. Assistance from the Margaret Herrick Library was invaluable in this process. A large group of stills from the missing section was located, thanks to collector Todd Terpening, and a script was worked out. It was felt that reconstructed section needed to continue the light- hearted feeling of the film and keep things moving, so motion was added to some of the stills and vignetting of the characters when they spoke.\n\nIt was a great thrill to see the final project for the first time and we are proud to have been able to bring William Desmond Taylor and Mary Pickford’s film back to life.\n\nThe Mary Pickford Foundation and the Paramount Film Archive partnered to access all elements available in the Pickford collections both at the UCLA Film & Television Archive and at the Library of Congress. Even though the archives were shut down during the pandemic, all parties cooperated to send the film elements to Paramount so they could be scanned in 4K resolution and commence work on the restoration.\n\nThe two primary elements used in this restoration were a 1967 35mm B&W Dupe Negative and an incomplete 1925 35mm Tinted Print. Scans from the Dupe Negative were used for the majority of the feature, and all surviving material from the print was inserted where possible. New inter-titles were digitally recreated for the Dupe Negative to match the feel and length of the Print, as the cards in the Negative were static and much longer than originally intended. The tinting scheme of the Print was used for all evening sequences: amber for night interiors and blue for night exteriors, with the rest of the feature B&W for all daytime sequences. Lastly, all the most egregious damage was digitally repaired, the film’s printed-in jitter was stabilized, and the film’s frame-rate was digitally varisped to 19fps, mirroring a more natural, hand-cranked projection speed suitable for 1918, the year of the film’s release.\n\nWritten by Jeff McCarty/Paramount Film Archive\n\nLittle Annie Rooney: (1925) The process of restoring and scoring Little Annie Rooney took several years. The original tinted nitrate print in Mary Pickford’s personal collection at the Library of Congress, made from the camera negative in 1925, was brought to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences archive in Los Angeles. The Academy Film Archive preserved the film photochemically, creating new 35mm preservation duplicate negatives and tinted prints. All photochemical work was completed at YCM Laboratory.\n\nThe preservation master was then scanned at 4K resolution so that the MPF, in cooperation with AMPAS, could create a digital version, evaluating the film frame by frame, removing dirt and other signs of deterioration to perfectly match the original nitrate tints and tones.\n\nThen, through the MPF Composition Program at Pepperdine University, an extremely gifted young composer, Andy Gladbach, was chosen to create a new sound track for the film. Mentored by professionals, Gladbach was joined by a 16 piece orchestra that included three percussionists, as well as a conductor and engineers, to record his original music. The film was digitally mastered at Modern VideoFilm. The end result combines and showcases the finest work of artists, craftspeople and musicians from this century and from 1925. The restored film elements are housed at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences Film Archive."
