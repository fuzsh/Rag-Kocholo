        "text": "First Chapter: 'Mary Pickford Rediscovered'\n\nBy MOLLY HASKELL\n\nMARY PICKFORD REDISCOVERED\n\nRare Pictures of a Hollywood Legend.\n\nBy Kevin Brownlow.\n\nIllustrated. 256 pp. New York:\n\nHarry N. Abrams in association with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. $39.95.\n\nt is indisputable that Mary Pickford was ''the most popular, powerful, prominent and influential woman in the history of cinema,'' as Robert Cushman, photograph curator at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, claims in this splendid book. Yet no one who was as vital to the development of motion pictures in the first half of the century fell so far from fashion in the latter half. Even in the fervent cinephilia of the 1970's, when film buffs excitedly disinterred early movies that were like time capsules from the past, the poison-pen letters of Erich von Stroheim were more welcome than the valentines from America's Sweetheart. Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith and Buster Keaton made their claims on the modern audience for whom silent film was a distant and difficult esthetic terrain, but we were much too sophisticated, too liberated, to look upon ''the little girl with the golden curls'' as anything but a quaint curiosity.\n\nPrecisely for this reason -- the fear that she would be laughed at -- Pickford (1893-1979), living out her days at Pickfair in her own, rather more benign version of ''Sunset Boulevard,'' withdrew her films from distribution, and we critics colluded in turning her into a joke by circulating the story of her as the archprude who ended Mae West's career by complaining to William Randolph Hearst about the bawdy lyrics of West's songs.\n\nAnyone who has seen a few of the major Pickford films knows that she was a great deal more than a cuddly little girl in ringlets and pinafores, but how much more is amply and beautifully demonstrated in ''Mary Pickford Rediscovered,'' a celebratory work of re-evaluation by the film historian Kevin Brownlow. Cushman, who is also the photographic services administrator at the academy's Margaret Herrick Library, has selected the book's exquisite photographs and movie stills, which range from Pickford at her most winsomely beautiful to her most unrecognizably, even grotesquely, plain. Brownlow, one of our most eloquent guides to silent cinema, provides fascinating background stories and appreciations of the films themselves and of Pickford's amazingly varied incarnations: she is child, adolescent and mother (and, in one 1921 film, ''Little Lord Fauntleroy,'' both mother and son; in an astonishingly sophisticated sleight-of-camera scene she kisses herself), tomboy and coquette, the Queen of Herzegovina and a cockney laundress, coddled rich girl and misshapen ''slavey'' (in the extraordinary dual characters in ''Stella Maris'' in 1918); she is obstreperous, belligerent, sweet, fierce, ingenious; spitfire and street fighter, lady, singer, dancer, daughter. She plays Spanish, French, Scottish, even Asian in a version of ''Madame Butterfly'' (1915), and if these impersonations were not uniformly successful, they testify to the ways in which her vast ambition dovetailed with the rich pantomimic possibilities of silent cinema before sound temporarily narrowed its dramatic vocabulary by demanding authenticity of diction and accent.\n\nThe scope of Pickford's popularity in the 1910's and 20's is difficult to imagine now. Discovered by audiences when actors were unbilled and unidentified, she emerged from the pack at Biograph and became the first real star and begetter of what would become the star system. And in 1915, within two years after she had signed with Adolph Zukor, she was, in an almost frighteningly meteoric rise, beloved above all others in every country where movies where shown. Vibrant, sincere, disarmingly funny and above all good, she had an appeal that was spiritual rather than erotic, and all the more powerful for that. ''The whole world wanted to put its arms around her,'' Cushman says, ''and in a way it did.'' She was a naturalistic actor by instinct, feeling her way into roles -- the director George Cukor used to say she invented screen acting and was the first Method actress -- at a time when broad gestures and melodramatic expressions were common currency.\n\nShe and her friend Lillian Gish acted in Griffith's early films, and it was to capture their extraordinary faces and the subtlety of their expressions, Brownlow argues, that Griffith developed the close-up. But where Gish, astonishing actress that she was, evolved very much as Griffith's creation, Pickford went her own way, choosing the heroines she would play, becoming architect of her own persona. Rarely a shrinking violet or a beautiful victim, she was more active and physical, likely to strike back if provoked, a resourceful fighter, clobbering abusers and standing up to bullies.\n\nNo less important to her phenomenal success was her grasp of both the art and business of moviemaking. Born poor, but willful and determined, she acted onstage from the age of 5 and was supporting her family by the age of 8. At 13, depressed by the shabbiness of her life in third-rate stock companies and seedy boardinghouses, she conducted a successful campaign to get into a David Belasco show on Broadway and from there made her way into movies. She took cinema seriously from the beginning, was the first female star to form her own corporation (in 1915) and to the new role of star-producer added that of distributor when, in 1919, she formed United Artists with Chaplin, Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks. She was a perfectionist, enlisting top directors, cinematographers, art directors and screenwriters. In the gifted but easygoing Marshall Neilan, she found her best and most compatible director, and in the all-important Frances Marion, a screenwriter with whom she formed a deep and creative bond. As fun-loving allies, they improvised on the set, devising slapstick moments, bringing out a comical and self-mocking side of Pickford that occasionally alarmed the studio brass. The childhood she missed as a precocious trouper was the one she re-created and enjoyed in her films, and she devoted enormous thought and care to reproducing the gestures and movements of a child, even devising special lighting and makeup that would make her adult features smoother and more like the rounder face of a little girl.\n\nBeing a powerhouse herself in ways that make today's feminist superwomen look like dilettantes, she inevitably clashed with star directors like Maurice Tourneur and Ernst Lubitsch. Still, the films they did together are among the most remarkable of her career, even if she is not always front and center.\n\nAs with so many show business superachievers, the fear of failure lurked beneath her success. In one of the book's many poignant passages in her own words, she describes the hellhole of her early stage career. She was acting in the dilapidated Thalia on the Bowery, where ''everything inside and out spoke of decaying grandeur: cracked marble, dulled gilt, creaking seats.'' Of all the hardships, the only one she could not accept was ''the fact that the dreariness and fatigue which we felt seemed to be reflected in the audience. Night after night I watched their bored apathetic faces, their entire lack of response, and I felt I could have borne the discomfort of it all if our performance had brought some small measure of satisfaction to them.'' This bitter memory, and the consuming desire to see pleasure, even adoration, in the eyes of her audience, became the driving force in her ascension to power, and she took her position as seriously as any queen. The need to please is, of course, both the genius and curse of the star, and Pickford's celebrity became a kind of gilded cage in which she dared not break out, or roam too far afield in her choice of parts, for fear of losing her fans.\n\nSome viewers, unable to get past the Victorian plot conventions, will always resist Pickford, but I find her films a revelation. Those values that once seemed archaic -- the intense family feeling, the sanctity of home and hearth, the championing of female virtue (always accompanied by spirited competence) -- now look refreshing. Moreover, her films dealt imaginatively and feelingly with real issues like adoption, child abuse and poverty. If they are cast in Dickensian extremes, they were extremes she had known -- wealth and destitution, fame and anonymity.\n\nMary Pickford was in the middle of it all, presiding over and profiting from so much of what was exciting and groundbreaking, technically and emotionally, in the silent cinema. Let's hope this literally and figuratively eye-opening book will serve as spur and companion to revivals of her films, and to what remains of the classical silent-film repertory.\n\nMolly Haskell's most recent book is ''Holding My Own in No Man's Land: Men and Women, Films and Feminists.''"
