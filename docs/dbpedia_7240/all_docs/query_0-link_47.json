        "text": "For psychoanalytic theory, the object of the cinema has always been the gaze. The importance of the gaze as the impossible object around which films are constructed is impossible to question. However, this essay contends that we should consider the importance of the voice as a possible object of a particular type of cinema. We should think of these two objects, the voice and the gaze, as having a historical relationship with each other. The contention here is that while the gaze is the object of the sound film, the voice is the object of the silent film. The absence of voices in silent cinema provides the perfect form for depicting the voice as an absent object. Once characters actually begin to speak on the screen, however, their voices obscure the voice as an absent object, and the result is that the gaze becomes the central cinematic object and preoccupation.\n\nAiming to contribute to an ongoing debate on the relationship between opera and screen media, my article begins by posing a number of questions about the aesthetic and political implications of technological reproduction. I then examine and critique a paradox that pervades our media-saturated culture-namely, that the remediation of musical-theatrical works is often treated as a means of enhancing, rather than of questioning, a sense of authenticity, uniqueness, and presence. This in turn leads me to an analysis of three objects (and three fantasies) in which this paradox, which is bound up with a strange blend of nostalgia and an urge for excess, takes on paradigmatic form. I conclude with a critical reflection on the challenge inherent in recording and broadcasting operatic stage productions. Throughout, I aim to suggest ways of avoiding a fetishization of liveness without, however, falling into another trap-the simple dichotomization of liveness and mediatization.\n\nFilm&#39;s attraction to opera began not with the technical possibility of synchronising the operatic voice with the image, but earlier, in the silent era. In theNew York Timesof 27 August 1910 Thomas Edison declared: ‘We&#39;ll be ready for the moving picture shows in a couple of months, but I&#39;m not satisfied with that.I want to give grand opera.’ What did silent film seek in opera? Would a silent film of or about opera have any meaning? What are the possibilities for silent opera? How would a mute operatic voice appear in film?\n\nLouis Andriessen and Peter Greenaway’s opera 'Rosa: The Death of a Composer' (premiered 1994 at Het Muziektheater in Amsterdam) and Philip Glass’s mixed media chamber opera 'The Photographer' (first performed in 1982 at Amsterdam’s Royal Palace) are both conceived as pieces of ‘musical investigation’: the test arrangement 'Rosa' examines the alleged assassination of a Uruguayan composer for Hollywood Western music in 1957; 'The Photographer' reenacts the homicide of a drama critic, shot by Eadweard Muybridge in 1874. However, forms of operatic (re-)presentation are hardly acknowledged as strategies of documentation – and much less criminal detection – but reputed to indulge in “concepts and illusions too preposterous to be tolerated in any other form” (P. Greenaway). To compensate for, and reflect on their seeming artificiality and lack of ‘realism’, both operas assimilate diverse representational systems which are closely associated either with scientific discourse or the technical reproduction of physical reality; on a content-related, formal, and medial level, Rosa and The Photographer employ the ‘cinematic’ (or ‘pre-cinematic’) as a means of deduction. Moreover, in both instances the tension or commutation between musical drama and discursive reconstruction seems to be emblematically subsumed in the figure of a horse, Juan Manuel de Rosa’s black mare in a treadmill-cradle on the one hand, the famous chronophotographical series “Horse in Motion” by Muybridge on the other. In this context, the paper focuses on the operas as self-reflexive investigations not so much of two cases of death, but of the representational potential of different media or dispositifs. It aims at the possible ‘reality effect’ of opera as well as the ‘theatricality’ of cinema’s moving images in order to determine the interplay of image/imaginary and real/reality.\n\nEarly film theorist Ricciotto Canudo equated cinema with music because of the Seventh Art’s inherent plasticity; in the 21st century, plasticity extends to the soundtrack. In this article, I explore the fusion of cinema with the musical genre of opera. By considering that film is a performative medium, beyond the actors’ agency, I confirm music’s importance in it as part of the structure and style of opera. Unlike Franco Zeffirelli’s adaptation of Verdi’s opera Otello, Orson Welles’s adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play conforms to Jacques Aumont’s concept of “operatic film” in that it engenders a coexistence of the verbal and the non-verbal, balancing drama and music with a performative intention. However, this film is so musicalized and operatically rendered, especially through its soundtrack, that it exceeds Aumont’s intention and becomes what I call a “cinematic opera”: a film that is operatic in its artificial and ritualistic nature as well as in its well-woven soundtrack of music, sound effects and voice working together in a common musicalized pattern.\n\nOver the last few years, sound and music practices during the silent film period have received an increasing attention from the academic community, both in film studies and musicology. The emergence of interdisciplinary networks, such as “The Sounds of Early Cinema in Britain” (Brown and Davison 2013) and the “Cabiria Research Project” in Italy (Colturato 2014), have contributed to widen the frame of this field, revealing the importance of national, regional and local specificities in the construction of early cinema as an auditory experience. In the context of the thematic issue on “Music, sound and cinema”, Aniki interviewed Claus Tieber and Anna K. Windish, researchers at the University of Salzburg and editors of The Sounds of Silent Films: New Perspectives on History, Theory and Practice, the proceedings of an international conference held in 2013 at Kiel University. Tieber and Windish are, respectively, principal investigator and research assistant of the project “The Sound of ..."
