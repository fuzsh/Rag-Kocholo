        "text": "To approach the cinema of the 1930s and 1940s, which I know far better than the silent era, and which I wanted to be able to cover somewhat more rapidly than I did the 1910s and 1920s (hah!), I decided to build an essentials list from the ground up instead of finalizing a list of twenty-five and seeing what deserved to stay and what deserved to go. This was obviously a grave error, because I started watching movies for this post last May, began writing it in August, and yet was still adding “must-see” films to my watch list in the fall. This is what you call self-sabotage—as opposed to the Hitchcock form of Sabotage (1936), which is much better.* In any case, I think I need to refrain from rewatching so many movies when I get to the 1940s. (Hah!)\n\nBut I digress…\n\nBack to the 1930s…\n\nTo build my list, I first identified the films that were on all the key “best of” lists I was using for reference: the AFI Top 100 lists from 1998 and 2007, the Sight & Sound “Greatest Films of All Time” Top 250 from 2012, and the 1001 Films You Must See Before You Die lists (all editions). There were seven such films: City Lights (1931), Duck Soup (1933), King Kong (1933), Modern Times (1936), Bringing Up Baby (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Wizard of Oz (1939). I had actually seen all seven already and so could immediately make some decisions. There were only three I felt I could put on my essentials list without hesitation: City Lights (1931), King Kong (1933), and The Wizard of Oz (1939). The other four I would have to mull over in my brain.\n\nNext, I scanned the individual lists for selections I had seen that seemed obvious candidates for inclusion on any essentials list. Four stood out to me immediately in this regard: Frankenstein (1931), Scarface (1932), Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), and It Happened One Night (1934). Each of these films is one of the best examples of arguably the four most important Hollywood genres of the 1930s: horror, gangster films, musicals, and romantic comedies.\n\nOf course, there were a number of other films that I thought were likely to go on the list, but I hadn’t seen them for some time and wanted to rewatch them, or at least, watch other similar films and then decide between them. Some of these films were Trouble in Paradise (1932), L’Atalante (1934), Pépé le Moko (1937), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), La Règle du jeu (1939), Stagecoach (1939), and The Women (1939). There was also the question of which Hitchcock would go on the list, The 39 Steps (1935) or The Lady Vanishes (1938)? At this point, M – Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder (M) (Lang, 1931) was also on my “rewatch” list, but later, when I actually watched it, I was pretty sure I hadn’t seen it before. Or, if I did, I remembered none of it. Consequently, I decided to count it as a new-to-me film for the purposes of cataloguing.\n\nMy next task was to come up with a “reasonable” watch list. What did I absolutely have to watch before I could even think of finalizing my list? So, I next identified the “important” films on these lists that I hadn’t yet seen.\n\nExcept for All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), which were both on the 1998 AFI list but not the 2007 list, I had seen all seventeen AFI films from the 1930s. Although these two films weren’t on the Sight & Sound list, they were on the 1001 list and they were both Best Picture winners, so I thought they merited consideration and added them to my watch list. Of the other Best Picture winners in this decade—Cimarron (1931), Grand Hotel (1932), Cavalcade (1933), It Happened One Night, The Great Ziegfeld (1936), The Life of Emile Zola (1937), You Can’t Take It with You (1938), Gone with the Wind—there were four I hadn’t already seen. Based on the discussion over at the (excellent) podcast The Envelope Please, I decided to also add Cavalcade to my watch list. [Side note: Shout out to Carlo (@ThiefCGT) at The Movie Loot for introducing me to the @PleaseEnvelope podcast. It really helped me decide which of the Best Picture nominees were worth my time.]\n\nOf the twenty-one films on the Sight & Sound list, I had already seen fifteen. Five of the six that I hadn’t seen—the aforementioned M, along with Tabu: A Story of the South Seas (Murnau, 1931), Otona no miru ehon – Umarete wa mita keredo (I Was Born, But…) (Ozu, 1932), Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (The Testament of Dr. Mabuse) (Lang, 1933), Zangiku monogatari (The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum) (Mizoguchi, 1939)—could be found on the Criterion Channel, and the sixth—Zemlya (Earth) (Dovzhenko, 1930)—could be rented from the library, so I quickly added all of them to my watch list. I wasn’t quite sure I was going to watch Mabuse, but I thought I would probably get to the others. [SPOILER ALERT: I actually did watch Mabuse but it did not make any of my final lists.]\n\nOf the ninety (!) 1930s films on the 1001 list, there were thirty-five I hadn’t seen. Obviously, even though most of them were surely worth seeking out, I decided to pick only five or so to try to get to before closing out the decade. I knew I would probably see way more than that, but I didn’t want to get too bogged down feeling I had to see everything. (Hah! See above re starting to write this post last August.) Further selections were made partly due to personal interest, partly due to recommendations, and partly due to their availability.\n\nIn the end, since posting about the 1920s in early May 2021, I have watched ninety films from the 1930s. Just over fifty of these were new-to-me films, the others were rewatches. You can see the full list of the 225 films I considered for this decade at the bottom of this post.**\n\nAlmost all of the films I considered are ones I have watched since 2016 when I first started seriously tracking and scoring everything I watch in my various film spreadsheets. However, I feel I should note that there are seven films I did not rewatch. In the case of some, it was because I ran out of time and decided I did not need to rewatch childhood favorites I had seen many times (Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz). In the case of others, it was because I know I dislike them enough not to include them on any lists and/or remembered they were “meh” films for me the first time (or two) and had no desire to rewatch them. These include L’Âge d’or (The Golden Age) (1930), Double Wedding (1937), Bringing Up Baby (1938), Ninotchka (1939), and Wuthering Heights (1939). Given more time, I might have rewatched the last two, but that will have to wait for another day when I am finished with this project. Finally, I also made the decision up front not to consider Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will) (1935) for this project—although I did watch (and enjoy) both Olympia (1938) films.\n\nObviously, there is no way I can possibly discuss even a fraction of these films with any depth, so I’m not even going to try. Instead, I am just going to build a few lists of recommendations to guide you through the 1930s.\n\nFirst, the essentials. Here, filmmaking technique, storytelling, and cultural influence were my most important criteria. But also, as I’ve mentioned before, I’m hoping to come out of this project with a well-rounded list that represents diverse interests and perspectives, or, at least, more than is traditionally found in the canon established by (mostly) straight white men.\n\nTo that end, of the new-to-me watches I’ve already mentioned, it was obvious fairly quickly that All Quiet on the Western Front, Zemlya (Earth), M, Tabu, and Zangiku monogatari (The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum) needed to be on the list. While none of these are films I will likely return to over and over, they are all excellent films that represent a wide diversity of cultures, stories, and filmmaking techniques. I also added I Was Born, But… (although I suspect I might choose a different Ozu were I to watch more of his 1930s work) and, after watching five Dietrich-Sternberg collaborations, Shanghai Express (1932). These films are exactly why I wanted to do this project, because, except for M and maybe Shanghai Express, I don’t think I would have chosen to watch any of them on my own.\n\nAt the same time, two other new-to-me films I decided to put on the essentials list are selections I probably would have gotten to eventually, as part of my annual #52FilmsByWomen pledge. The pickings are fairly slim when it comes to female directors in the 1930s—I initially identified only fifteen films for possible viewing—however, I quite enjoyed the thirteen films I was able to see*** and found most of them to be vastly underrated. In the end, both Mädchen in Uniform (Sagan, 1931), a lesbian-themed coming-of-age tale set in a German boarding school, and Olympia 1. Teil: Fest der Volker (Olympia Part 1: Festival of the Nations) (Riefenstahl, 1938), a revolutionary documentary about the 1936 Summer Olympics, went on the essentials list, as did Dorothy Arzner’s Merrily We Go to Hell (1932), a pre-Code tale of addiction and infidelity. Another Arzner film—The Bride Wore Red (1937), a study in class dynamics and female friendship disguised as a romance—made it onto my favorites list.\n\nRewatches that made their way onto the essentials list include the aforementioned L’Atalante, The Lady Vanishes, and Trouble in Paradise. I’m not a huge fan of L’Atalante myself, but sometimes you just have to go with the flow. France has one of the strongest national cinemas of the 1930s and needed to have at least a few representatives on the list. In addition to L’Atalante, I added a film each from its biggest filmmakers of the decade: Jean Renoir and Marcel Carné. For Carné, I chose Le jour se lève (Daybreak) (1939), one of his best collaborations with screenwriter-poet Jacques Prévert, and for Renoir, I chose La Grande Illusion (1937). [Side note: I did rewatch La Règle du jeu (The Rules of the Game) (1939) recently, but I think I like it even less than I did when I first watched it years ago, if that’s possible. #SorryNotSorry] I had hoped to fit in one more French film, one of René Clair’s early musical comedies, but I just couldn’t find a spot for it on the list.\n\nSpeaking of which, back to some of the “list-topper” films I hesitated about earlier. Ultimately, I decided only Gone with the Wind was “essential” viewing, both because of its technique and production values and its cultural impact and influence. As for the others, I just don’t view them as essential. Modern Times has probably the strongest argument, but it would be the second 1930s Chaplin on the list and it’s a bit of a rip-off of René Clair’s À nous la liberté so I think not. I hesitated most over Duck Soup. Mostly because I don’t really love the Marx brothers, although I know many other people do, but also because, if I had to choose, I actually prefer A Night at the Opera (1935). In the end, I couldn’t find a place for it with all the other fantastic options. Finally, beyond loathing Bringing Up Baby, I just don’t see the justification for it. Not only are there are better screwballs to put on the list, there are better screwballs by Howard Hawks to put on the list. I mean, when I get to the 1940s, His Girl Friday is pretty much a given. In any case, I put the delightful My Man Godfrey (1936) and that ultimate piece of Americana, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), on the list instead.\n\nFor more on why I so dislike Bringing Up Baby, see 1930s Screwball Classics and Forgotten Films.\n\nAnd, with that, my final list of twenty-five essentials for the 1930s:\n\nEssential Films of the 1930s\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930)\n\nZemlya (Earth) (1930)\n\nCity Lights (1931)\n\nFrankenstein (1931)\n\nM – Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder (M) (1931)\n\nMädchen in Uniform (1931)\n\nTabu: A Story of the South Seas (1931)\n\nMerrily We Go to Hell (1932)\n\nOtona no miru ehon – Umarete wa mita keredo (I Was Born, But…) (1932)\n\nScarface (1932)\n\nShanghai Express (1932)\n\nTrouble in Paradise (1932)\n\nGold Diggers of 1933 (1933)\n\nKing Kong (1933)\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934)\n\nL’Atalante (1934)\n\nMy Man Godfrey (1936)\n\nLa Grande Illusion (1937)\n\nThe Lady Vanishes (1938)\n\nOlympia 1. Teil: Fest der Volker (Olympia Part 1: Festival of the Nations) (1938)\n\nGone with the Wind (1939)\n\nLe jour se lève (Daybreak) (1939)\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nZangiku monogatari (The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum) (1939)\n\nAfter establishing my list of essentials, I next set out to finalize my list of favorite 1930s films. As you might imagine, this list was a bit easier to pull together; however ranking these movies was somewhat tricky. The key question determining selection and placement here is “How eager am I to rewatch this?”\n\nFor the most part, these are movies I have known and loved for many years, although there is one entry I only saw for the first time this past year and that’s Love Me Tonight, a musical I borrowed from the library but that I purchased on blu-ray just hours after watching it. I am not a huge fan of musicals, but I loved the songs in this one, and was very impressed with their staging as well as the cinematography and editing overall.\n\nFavorite Films of the 1930s, Ranked\n\nThe Thin Man (1934)\n\nThe Lady Vanishes (1938)\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934)\n\nThe Old Dark House (1932)\n\nMy Man Godfrey (1936)\n\nGold Diggers of 1933 (1933)\n\nThe 39 Steps (1935)\n\nLove Me Tonight (1932)\n\nTrouble in Paradise (1932)\n\nEasy Living (1937)\n\nIf You Could Only Cook (1935)\n\nLa Grande Illusion (1937)\n\nThe Women (1939)\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nThe Bride Wore Red (1937)\n\nPépé le Moko (1937)\n\nFreaks (1932)\n\nYou Can’t Take It with You (1938)\n\nHoliday (1938)\n\nLe Crime de Monsieur Lange (1936)\n\n42nd Street (1933)\n\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)\n\nFaisons un rêve (Let’s Make a Dream) (1936)\n\nJezebel (1938)\n\nStagecoach (1939)\n\nThat’s all well and good you might say, but if almost all your favorites are longtime faves what was the point of all this? And that’s why I had to create a third category and a new kind of list: Hidden Gems. These movies do not appear on my list of essential films, but may appear on my list of favorites for the decade. Either way, they are well worth your time. In general, they are films that I was pleasantly surprised by or that I consider underrated or underseen. For the most part, I am likely to return to many of these before some of the essentials.\n\nA few highlights…\n\nIf you are looking for atmosphere: Films like Hôtel du Nord (1938) are the reason I love the Criterion Channel. I had never seen this classic that contains perhaps the most famous line of all of French cinema (“Atmosphère! Atmosphère! Est-ce que j’ai une gueule d’atmosphère?”) because it was so hard to find for years and still isn’t available in the collection of either my public or local membership library. But it’s permanently on the Criterion Channel, even if it is (tragically) not part of the Criterion Collection.\n\nPre-Code risqué behavior: Speaking of the Criterion Collection, they really need to put out more Dorothy Arzner. Sure, I’ve bought Dance, Girl, Dance (1940) and Merrily We Go to Hell, but what I really want is Working Girls (1931), a light pre-Code romp about two sisters who move to the big city. Crackling banter, great camera work, fairly unpredictable. Definitely worth seeking out if you can find it. See also, the musical murder mystery, Murder at the Vanities (1934).\n\nOlympic fever: I’m not sure why the two parts of Olympia (Part 1: Festival of the Nations and Part 2: Festival of Beauty) are considered separate films, but they are on most film sites, otherwise I would have put the whole darn thing on the essentials list. More people seem to have watched the first part, which features Jesse Owens, but my favorite moments in this four-hour documentary are the diving scenes, which are found in the second part.\n\nBig in Japan: Japanese cinema is a big gap for me and one I was hoping to fill with this project. In fact, that is one reason this post is so delayed. The few Japanese films I managed to get to in the early stages, such as Minato no nihon musume (Japanese Girls at the Harbor) (1933) and Ninjō Kami Fūsen (Humanity and Paper Balloons) (1937), made me want to add a whole bunch more films to my watch list.\n\nSolid like a rock: Dodsworth (1936) always seems to be the first thing I think of when people ask me what I’ve discovered looking at the 1930s. Just an utterly solid Hollywood film with an interesting plot and great cast that more people should know. See also, Stage Door (1937).\n\nStar performances: Here are a few films and lead performances that made me finally “get” the appeal of certain actors and actresses: Norma Shearer in The Divorcee (1930), Paul Muni in I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), Charles Laughton in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), Edward G. Robinson in The Whole Town’s Talking (1935), and Robert Donat in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939).\n\nThe OG of better-known remakes: In case you thought remakes and reboots were a new thing, they most certainly are not. It may be hard to believe, but in the cases of Make Way for Tomorrow (1937), remade as Tokyo Story (1953), Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), remade as House of Wax (1953), and Love Affair (1939), remade as An Affair to Remember (1957), I actually prefer the original version to the remake.\n\nFinally, Hell-Bound Train (1930). What to say about this one? You really have to experience it to understand why I love this odd little film by self-taught evangelical filmmakers James & Eloyce Gist, who used the medium of film to preach against dancing, drinking, and gambling. You can find it as part of the Pioneers of African American Cinema collection on both Kanopy and the Criterion Channel.\n\nNow, to the list! As with my favorites list above, this is a ranked list. For a complete ranking of all 225 films that I considered for this post, you can consult A Century+: 1930s Ranked.\n\nHidden Gems of the 1930s, Ranked\n\nLove Me Tonight (1932)\n\nHôtel du Nord (1938)\n\nFootlight Parade (1933)\n\nOlympia 2. Teil: Fest der Schonheit (Olympia Part 2: Festival of Beauty) (1938)\n\nDishonored (1931)\n\nNinjō Kami Fūsen (Humanity and Paper Balloons) (1937)\n\nMinato no nihon musume (Japanese Girls at the Harbor) (1933)\n\nDodsworth (1936)\n\nMake Way for Tomorrow (1937)\n\nMidnight (1939)\n\nStage Door (1937)\n\nThe Divorcee (1930)\n\nI Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932)\n\nMutiny on the Bounty (1935)\n\nMystery of the Wax Museum (1933)\n\nMurder at the Vanities (1934)\n\nThe Whole Town’s Talking (1935)\n\nCaptain Blood (1935)\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Chips (1939)\n\nLove Affair (1939)\n\nZouzou (1934)\n\nWorking Girls (1931)\n\nÀ nous la liberté (1931)\n\nDestry Rides Again (1939)\n\nHell-Bound Train (1930)\n\nTo close, a few words on some films I didn’t see. My biggest regret in terms of my essentials list is not making time for Limite (1931), an experimental Brazilian film; Alexander Nevsky (1938), by the great Sergei Eisenstein (I hope to make up for this by watching both parts of Ivan the Terrible); and several Japanese films, including Ukikusa monogatari (A Story of Floating Weeds) (1934), Arigatō-san (Mr. Thank You) (1936), and Gion no kyōdai (Sisters of the Gion) (1936). These films are all on the Criterion Channel so I really have no excuse except time. Finally, I really wanted to see Xiǎo wányì (Little Toys) (1933), a silent Chinese film, but I just can’t bear to watch movies on YouTube.\n\nIn other words, there are a lot of great films out there.

But the problem is, like with so many things, once you start looking more closely at something, the more you realize you don’t know. So, when I first sat down to finalize a “canon” for the decade, I realized I needed to add a few more unseen films, along with a few I had blocked from my memory and, while not eager to revisit, decided I must do so in order to accurately represent the decade. At the end of the day, I found myself with a list of a dozen films I felt I absolutely had to watch, including seven I had never seen. And that is not even counting the myriad other “minor” films I wanted to squeeze in. So, yeah, I was already weeks behind schedule and still took the full month of March and some of April to get through these. [Side note: At this point, I’ve decided it’s a bit more important to me to do this thing thoroughly rather than try to stay on my original schedule, so the 1930s will happen when it happens.]\n\nIn any case, let’s jump right in!\n\nTo start with, here is my original essentials list for the 1920s:\n\nDas Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) (Weine, 1920)\n\nWay Down East (Griffith, 1920)\n\nHäxan (Christensen, 1922)\n\nNanook of the North (Flaherty, 1922)\n\nNosferatu (Murnau, 1922)\n\nSafety Last! (Newmeyer & Taylor, 1923)\n\nGreed (Stroheim, 1924)\n\nThe Thief of Bagdad (Walsh, 1924)\n\nBen-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (Niblo & Brabin, 1925)\n\nThe Big Parade (Vidor, 1925)\n\nBody and Soul (Micheaux, 1925)\n\nBronenosets Potyomkin (Battleship Potemkin) (Eisenstein, 1925)\n\nThe Gold Rush (Chaplin, 1925)\n\nLady Windermere’s Fan (Lubitsch, 1925)\n\nDie Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (The Adventures of Prince Achmed)\n\n(Reiniger, 1926)\n\nThe General (Keaton, 1926)\n\nKonets Sankt-Peterburga (The End of St. Petersburg) (Pudovkin, 1927)\n\nMetropolis (Lang, 1927)\n\nNapoléon (Gance, 1927)\n\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans (Murnau, 1927)\n\nWings (Wellman, 1927)\n\nLa Coquille et le clergyman (The Seashell and the Clergyman) (Dulac, 1928)\n\nLa Passion de Jeanne d’Arc (The Passion of Joan of Arc) (Dreyer, 1928)\n\nChelovek s kino-apparatom (The Man with a Movie Camera) (Vertov, 1929)\n\nUn chien andalou (An Andalusian Dog) (Buñuel, 1929)\n\nAbout half of these selections came directly from the AFI Top 100 and the Sight & Sound 250.* In fact, the only films on those lists that didn’t make the cut are The Jazz Singer (1927) (AFI) and The Last Laugh (1924) (S&S), both of which I had already seen (and rejected as essential) before establishing my own list. In the case of The Jazz Singer—the first “talkie”—the overall quality is just not there. In the case of The Last Laugh, I felt that having three films by the same director (F.W. Murnau) would be antithetical to my goals with this project.\n\nAs for the rest of the titles, they mostly came from books on cinema history. All in all, except for a few titles, I’d say this would be fairly close to the standard response you would get if you were to ask for a canon of twenty-five films from the 1920s. In fact, I recently added a tab for the “1001 Movies You Must Watch Before You Die” films to my “all-time lists” spreadsheet, and, although I didn’t have it for reference when I created this list, all twenty-five of my selections can be found among the forty-five films from the 1920s on that list.* [Side note: Although I have numerous quibbles with the lists that appear in various books in the 1001 series, I think this one will prove to be very helpful in establishing more balanced essentials lists going forward.]\n\nIn any case, there’s really no doubt that the above list is a good beginning if one wants to explore and get a sense of the cinema of the 1920s. To start with, it highlights the three strongest national film industries of the period—those of Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States. It also features a number of key “first” features and experimental films: animation, documentaries, and surrealist films. In fact, as I sat down to write up the decade, I wondered if I would change it at all. But then, as I looked closer, I started to see the gaps and flaws.\n\nThe biggest obvious gap is that there are no sound pictures—after all, the “talkie” emerged as early as 1927. Although early talkies were rather crude, they represent the surmounting of extreme technical challenges and therefore can rightly be considered cinematic achievements worthy of essential status. This is a gap that needs to be remedied somehow.\n\nBeyond the glaring oversight of sound, now that I’ve watched all the films on the original list, the lack of genre diversity has become more obvious. For example, there are three similar types of comedies, one each from those who are often seen as the “big three” comic geniuses: Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. While I enjoyed their films above, they are not necessarily my favorite, or the best, examples from these comedians. More importantly, do we need all three to accurately represent this decade in film? In a similar vein, do we need three horror films? Even if all of them are solid selections, that seems a bit much. And there are six war films—that’s one quarter of the list! What about musicals? Or thrillers? Or westerns?\n\nFinally, and this is somewhat related to the above paragraph, why all the dudes? I don’t just mean in terms of directors, but the leading roles in almost all of these films are men. And the women that are prominently featured are fairly one dimensional. Lots of martyrs and witches. Sometimes literally. Where are the comediennes? Where are the complex women?\n\nSo, even though every choice on the above list is a fair one, it was clear I was going to have to rethink this to accurately represent the decade in film. I started by thinking about what worked together and what could definitely go.\n\nFirst to go were Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ and Wings. Even this was a difficult decision. These are both solid films that I enjoyed, but I just don’t think they are essential if one is limited to only twenty-five films. However, I want to note here that I actually prefer the 1925 Ben-Hur to the 1959 version, which is the one on the AFI list. Wings was just one war film too many for me, but it merits a viewing if only to admire its incredible technical work, including astounding aerial combat sequences and this bravura shot:\n\nLet’s see, what’s next? Well, speaking of bravura, I think it’s safe to say that Safety Last! is only known for one extended stunt (pictured above). While it’s a great stunt, this rom-com is not even my favorite Harold Lloyd (that would be Girl Shy), so I can’t say I regard it as a must-see beyond that. In fact, since we are losing Clara Bow’s presence in Wings, I would much rather see It (1927)—another rom-com based in a department store—on the list. After all, the original “It girl” really should to be included somewhere.\n\nAnother film that is pretty much known for one sequence is Way Down East. But, as with Bow, I think if I take that one off, I would definitely want to put another Lillian Gish vehicle in the mix, probably either Orphans of the Storm (1921), also by D.W. Griffith, or The Wind (1928), a western by Victor Sjöström. Or maybe both, if there’s room.\n\nSo, I guess I need to decide if there is room. How many films do I really want to add?\n\nAfter thinking long and hard about the gaps I wanted to fill, and what I had seen so far from the 1920s, I came up with the following list:\n\nThe Grub-Stake: A Tale of the Klondike (Shipman & Van Tuyle, 1923)\n\nIt (Badger & Sternberg, 1927)\n\nThe Wind (Sjöström, 1928)\n\nBlackmail (Hitchcock, 1929)\n\nA Cottage on Dartmoor (Asquith, 1929)\n\nHallelujah (Vidor, 1929)\n\nThe Love Parade (Lubitsch, 1929)\n\nThe only problem with this list is that it adds seven films when I’ve only made room for four so far. To find out what I finally kept and what I didn’t, and why, read on.\n\nBreaking the Sound Barrier\n\nAs noted above, the biggest problem with my list is that there were no sound pictures. I only watched seven early talkies for this project, but they all had some sort of technical merit whereby I could see adding them to this list. Those I considered—but ultimately rejected—were The Broadway Melody (1929), the first sound film to win the Best Picture Oscar; Applause (1929), one of the first sound films to shoot on location around Manhattan; In Old Arizona (1928), nominated for five Academy Awards, and the first major western to use sound and the first talkie filmed extensively outdoors; and Hell’s Heroes (1929), another western and the first sound production of William Wyler.\n\nThe three I selected for inclusion—Blackmail, Hallelujah, and The Love Parade—were all a cut above, although I added all three for very different reasons.\n\nWhen I realized that I had no Alfred Hitchcock on my list, Blackmail sort of became inevitable. I contemplated The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), Hitchcock’s first thriller and my favorite of his silents, but I soon realized that Blackmail was a better choice since it is one of the best representations you can find of the transition from silent pictures to talkies. In fact, the film began life as a silent but morphed into a sound picture early on in its production. Like a number of films of the era, two versions (silent and sound) were made, since many theaters had not yet converted to sound. In any case, it’s a decent thriller with some fantastic sound cues.\n\nAnother director who mastered the transition from silent films to sound was Ernst Lubitsch. One of his first sound films was The Love Parade, a musical starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, one of many he would go on to make with the pair in the early 1930s, but I think this first outing is their best. Among other accolades, it received six nominations for the third Academy Awards, the most of any film to that point. While I don’t love The Love Parade quite as much as Lubitsch’s silent adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s Lady Windermere’s Fan, I can accept that it should replace that film on the list as one of the first movie musicals with integrated songs (rather than a backstage musical, which was a prevalent subgenre in the early sound period).\n\nAnother musical I decided to add is Hallelujah, King Vidor’s first sound film. Hallelujah is not only an early MGM musical, but also one of the first films by a major studio with an all-Black cast. Vidor, who grew up in the South, was so interested in telling this story that he invested his own salary in the production when MGM balked at producing it. He would go on to be nominated for a Best Director Oscar for the film. Though it does rely on and perhaps perpetuated common stereotypes, the songs and singing are really quite beautiful and I appreciated that they were integrated into the storyline in a very natural way. And I am going to keep an eye out for Nina Mae McKinney going forward, she had a tremendous energy about her.\n\nSo that more than takes care of both sound and a missing genre, the musical. It also adds a thriller into the mix and gets us another empty slot on the essentials list by (unfortunately) removing Lady Windermere’s Fan. Though, really, if you like Lubitsch, I definitely recommend you seek that one out. He somehow manages to keep the spirit of Wilde while keeping almost none of Wilde’s original text—the “Lubitsch touch” strikes again.\n\nWhile we’re switching out films by the same director, another “essentials” exchange I decided to make was replacing Oscar Micheaux’s Body and Soul for Within Our Gates (1920). I definitely think there needs to be at least one “race film” on the list and Micheaux is the obvious director to represent this genre—films made from the mid-1910s to the early 1950s featuring Black casts and produced for Black audiences. Not only was Micheaux the first major African American feature filmmaker, but he was a “triple threat”—writing, producing, and directing more than forty films during this period. While both these titles have qualities to recommend them, I thought Within Our Gates had a better, more cohesive plot: The main narrative tells the story of a young southern woman who travels north on multiple occasions, finding romance and a wealthy benefactor for a southern school along the way, but also uses a series of flashbacks to show her tragic background, including her adoptive father being falsely accused of murdering a white man and the resulting lynching of her parents. It’s a powerful tale of race and racism in the early twentieth century.\n\nAll the World Loves a Clown\n\nSome other exchanges I considered making were in the comedy category. When I began this project and came up with my list of essentials for the 1920s, it seemed obvious to include an example each of the work of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. So, I put the usual suspects (The Gold Rush, The General, and Safety Last!) on my essentials list. However, as I watched more movies starring these comedians, in addition to discovering that none of these selections represents my favorite of their films (see rankings below), I also realized that this was a rather odd way of looking at things. For one, is there any other decade where I would say we have to list one film by each of three comedians as an “essential”? I don’t think so. Even if I think that comedy generally doesn’t get the respect it deserves, that seems a bit much when you are choosing only twenty-five films to represent a decade in cinema.\n\nMoreover, if we are going to put three comedies on the list, what about the great comediennes of the silent era? Of course, Clara Bow would be represented by including It, but what about The Extra Girl (1923) with Mabel Normand or Show People with Marion Davies? Both are hilarious send-ups of Hollywood and the Hollywood system. Or, for a different side of Davies, how about The Patsy, where Davies displays her incredible gift for mimicry? The issue is further complicated by the fact that I think that City Lights (1931) is far and away the best representation of Chaplin’s work, but obviously that would be on the 1930s list. Is there room for two Chaplins if we are ignoring these women?\n\nTop 20 Comedies of 1920s\n\nSherlock Jr. (Keaton, 1924)\n\nThe Patsy (Vidor, 1928) (Davies)\n\nThe Kid (Chaplin, 1921)\n\nThe General (Keaton & Bruckman, 1927)\n\nIt (Badger & Sternberg, 1927) (Bow)\n\nGirl Shy (Newmeyer & Taylor, 1924) (Lloyd)\n\nOur Hospitality (Keaton & Blystone, 1923)\n\nThe Circus (Chaplin, 1928)\n\nSafety Last! (Newmeyer & Taylor, 1923) (Lloyd)\n\nShow People (Vidor, 1928) (Davies)\n\nSteamboat Bill, Jr. (Keaton & Reisner, 1928)\n\nThe Gold Rush (Chaplin, 1925)\n\nThe Extra Girl (Jones & Sennett, 1923) (Normand)\n\nThe Navigator (Keaton & Crisp, 1924)\n\nThe Flapper (Crosland, 1920) (Olive Thomas)\n\nSeven Chances (Keaton, 1925)\n\nThe Kid Brother (Wilde, 1927) (Lloyd)\n\nThe Cameraman (Keaton & Sedgwick, 1928)\n\nThe Freshman (Newmeyer & Taylor, 1925) (Lloyd)\n\nChampagne (Hitchcock, 1928) (Betty Balfour)\n\nAll this is to say that, in addition to bumping Safety Last!, I seriously considered replacing The Gold Rush altogether. One reason I almost did so is that there was another “tale of the Klondike” that I wanted to put on the list far more: The Grub-Stake (1923). Not only does this film by female filmmaker Nell Shipman add another action adventure into the essentials mix, one could also consider it a western. More importantly, like The Gold Rush, it also features a bear! And this one gets far more screen time. While lacking the comic touches of Chaplin’s film, the story was far more interesting to me: A young woman is lured to the Yukon with promises of marriage and a grubstake and only realizes she has been tricked when she ends up for sale in a Dawson City dance hall. Instead of meekly accepting her fate, she escapes with her ailing father and an old miner by stealing the dogsled from her erstwhile “husband” and heading into the wilderness where she gets lost in a snowstorm, finds shelter in a bear’s den, and stumbles upon a long-lost gold mine. It all ends with a western-style shoot-out and a literal cliffhanger. You can see why I might have hesitated for so long as to which one to keep, until I thought, why not both?\n\nBut keeping both would mean a few more cuts to my initial list if I was also going to add The Wind and A Cottage on Dartmoor, which I really wanted to do. Could I be as strong as Nell Shipman taking on a bear and get the job done? I like to think so.\n\nGetting Down to Brass Tacks\n\nFirst off, why add The Wind and A Cottage on Dartmoor? Well, to start with, The Wind adds a western and a female lead to a list lacking both. It also makes sure another major star and director of the era are represented (with Lillian Gish and Victor Sjöström respectively). The British film A Cottage on Dartmoor does not tick off any obvious boxes, but combines the best of Soviet and German styles (fast cutting, facial close-ups, atmospheric lighting, asymmetrical camera angles) while also providing a story straight out of the works of Graham Greene. Both films are tense melodramas that get down and dirty with the psyche of their protagonists while also being incredibly cinematic and inventive. One example of this inventiveness, and why A Cottage on Dartmoor truly deserves to be on the essentials list, is the theater scene—when the protagonist follows the subject of his romantic obsession and her date to the cinema. This extended set piece in the middle of the film tells us everything we need to know about these characters, but also manages to serve as a commentary on the arrival of talkies and a master class in editing. It is nothing short of amazing.\n\nTo keep these two films as essentials, I decided to eliminate (Shock! Horror!) Nosferatu and Un chien andalou. Or should that be (Shock!) Un chien andalou and (Horror!) Nosferatu? Because that is essentially what these two films represent and I think I have that covered elsewhere.\n\nSurrealism and the Avant-Garde\n\nAs I said back in the days of The Great Unseen, one reason I resisted silent cinema for so long is that most of my exposure to it was in graduate school. Because my coursework focused on French culture, this generally meant the early films of the Lumière brothers and Georges Méliès (discussed in A Century+ of Cinema: The Early Silents, 1895–1909) and the surrealist cinema of the 1920s, including René Clair’s Entr’acte (1924), Fernand Léger’s Ballet mécanique (1924), Germaine Dulac’s La Coquille et le clergyman (The Seashell and the Clergyman) (1928), and Un chien andalou (An Andalusian Dog) (1929) by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí. However, while I can appreciate the technique and artistry of these films, they just aren’t of particular interest to me and I don’t enjoy watching them.\n\nNevertheless, I felt I needed to include at least some of them on my essentials list, so I chose La Coquille et le clergyman, which, at just over forty minutes long, qualifies as a feature film, and Un chien andalou, the ultimate surrealist classic whose opening scene has haunted me since my grad school days. [CW: Don’t watch it if, like me, you have issues with incisions of any kind.] I also watched Melville Webber and J.S. Watson’s The Fall of the House of Usher (1928),** both because I love Edgar Allan Poe and because it was on one of the “Treasures” DVDs that I had out from the library.\n\nWhile this type of film is just not my jam, I did find things to appreciate in both La Coquille et le clergyman and The Fall of the House of Usher. I particularly liked some of the visuals in the latter. However, watching Un chien andalou again after all these years, the only thing that struck me (besides the infamous opening) is just how misogynistic and hyper-violent it really is. Of course, surrealism is meant to shock, but I just don’t see a value in doing only that. To me, it’s like Pixar and nostalgia:\n\n—It made me cry!\n\n—Ok, and…?\n\nSo my vote in terms of what should stay on the essentials list was for La Coquille et le clergyman, widely recognized as the first surrealist film and which the British Board of Film Classification famously banned, stating “If there is a meaning, it is doubtless objectionable.” Today, the British Film Institute lists La Coquille et le clergyman as one of the best feminist films calling it “a visually imaginative critique of patriarchy—state and church—and of male sexuality.” In short, while I considered having Dulac’s La Souriante Mme Beudet (The Smiling Madame Beudet) on the essentials list, I am happy to represent this pioneering writer, critic, and filmmaker with La Coquille et le clergyman instead.\n\nThe horror! The horror!\n\nWhile I actually enjoy Nosferatu quite a bit, as one of two films by F.W. Murnau on the list, the most conventional of the three horror films included, and one of four German films, it just made the most sense for it to be the one taken off.\n\nAs noted in my previous post on the 1910s, Scandinavian cinema was particularly strong in the silent period and I wanted to be sure to include at least one Danish or Swedish film for the 1920s. I considered Körkarlen (The Phantom Carriage) (1921) by Victor Sjöström, which is notable for its special effects and advanced narrative structure, but I knew I would probably have another Sjöström somewhere, and Häxan, which I just watched for the first time quite recently, is absolutely astounding. Part documentary essay, part horror film, it charts the history of witchcraft and the superstitions surrounding it, beginning in the Middle Ages through to the present day of the film. It was the most expensive Scandinavian silent film ever made and was banned or censored in a number of countries for its graphic nature.\n\nWhy Caligari over Nosferatu, you ask? (Well, you ask if you are familiar with my post on silent horror.) After all, they are both German and you really dislike Caligari. That’s true, but I also dislike Metropolis and yet here we are. Some films are just so influential, you can’t deny them their place on the essentials list. I mean, if I was only including works by German directors I liked, The Cat and the Canary (Leni, 1927) and Diary of a Lost Girl (Pabst, 1929) would be on the list instead.\n\nThat’s right, I said it. I don’t like Metropolis. It may be “important” and it may have some great visuals, but the acting leaves a lot to be desired, as does the plot and script. If you like Metropolis, I’m glad it’s there for you, but if you don’t, know there are many other entertaining silent films that may be more to your liking.\n\nFor starters, any number of the many films I’ve already discussed, or perhaps some of my other favorites on the essentials list that I don’t have time to go into, which includes Erich von Stroheim’s Greed, an adaptation of McTeague: A Story of San Francisco, one of my favorite novels; Raoul Walsh’s The Thief of Bagdad, starring the original swashbuckler, Douglas Fairbanks; Lotte Reiniger’s The Adventures of Prince Achmed, considered to be the oldest surviving animated feature film; King Vidor’s The Big Parade, the most successful film of the 1920s and noted for its realistic depiction of warfare; Abel Gance’s epic masterpiece Napoléon, one of the most creative uses of the cinematic form ever; and F.W. Murnau’s Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans, one of the most expressive films of the silent period and one of my favorite discoveries from The Great Unseen.\n\nNot to mention some great films that didn’t even have a hope of making the list, including the aforementioned The Cat and the Canary (Leni, 1927); but also The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Worsley, 1923), with its impressive sets and Lon Chaney’s performance as the titular character; The Lost World (Hoyt, 1925), or the fantastic Wallace Beery in a King Kong before King Kong; Chess Fever, a hilarious 1925 short from the director of the much more serious Konets Sankt-Peterburga (The End of St. Petersburg); Paris qui dort (The Crazy Ray) (Clair, 1925), a sci-fi romp through the empty streets of Paris; The Unknown (Browning, 1927), another incredible Chaney performance, this time alongside a young Joan Crawford; The Docks of New York (Sternberg, 1928), a proto-noir from the master of visual style; The Garden of Eden (Milestone, 1928), an underseen rom-com from the underrated and incredibly diverse Lewis Milestone; and Spione (Spies), a Fritz Lang silent I very much like.\n\nAnd, with that, my final list of twenty-five essentials for the 1920s:\n\nEssential Films of the 1920s\n\nDas Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) (Weine, 1920)\n\nWithin Our Gates (Micheaux, 1920)\n\nHäxan (Christensen, 1922)\n\nNanook of the North (Flaherty, 1922)\n\nThe Grub-Stake: A Tale of the Klondike (Shipman & Van Tuyle, 1923)\n\nGreed (Stroheim, 1924)\n\nThe Thief of Bagdad (Walsh, 1924)\n\nThe Big Parade (Vidor, 1925)\n\nBronenosets Potyomkin (Battleship Potemkin) (Eisenstein, 1925)\n\nThe Gold Rush (Chaplin, 1925)\n\nDie Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (The Adventures of Prince Achmed)\n\n(Reiniger, 1926)\n\nThe General (Keaton, 1926)\n\nIt (Badger, 1927)\n\nKonets Sankt-Peterburga (The End of St. Petersburg) (Pudovkin, 1927)\n\nMetropolis (Lang, 1927)\n\nNapoléon (Gance, 1927)\n\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans (Murnau, 1927)\n\nLa Coquille et le clergyman (The Seashell and the Clergyman) (Dulac, 1928)\n\nLa Passion de Jeanne d’Arc (The Passion of Joan of Arc) (Dreyer, 1928)\n\nThe Wind (Sjöström, 1928)\n\nBlackmail (Hitchcock, 1929)\n\nChelovek s kino-apparatom (Man with a Movie Camera) (Vertov, 1929)\n\nA Cottage on Dartmoor (Escape from Dartmoor) (Asquith, 1929)\n\nHallelujah (Vidor, 1929)\n\nThe Love Parade (Lubitsch, 1929)\n\nIn short, there are a lot of great silents out there.

Or any films at all really. Of the films that ended up on my essentials list (see my previous post on Considering the Essentials), I had only seen one of them prior to 2019—The Immigrant, a Charlie Chaplin short. So, even though many of the industry developments during this period were well known to me from my dissertation research, I had a lot to learn about the films of this decade.\n\nBut let’s start with what I knew.\n\nTo begin with, the defining characteristic of the 1910s is probably its transitional and inconsistent nature, with dramatic changes in the film medium as well as modes of production, distribution, and exhibition.\n\nAlthough the first narrative features emerge in the middle of this decade,* until 1919, popular films could be anything from a one- or two-reel comedy (about 25 minutes) to grand epics of more than two hours to ten-episode serials with episodes of varying lengths. Many multi-reelers were episodic in nature and more like one-reelers strung together, for example, the grand epics Cabiria and Intolerance both have multiple narrative threads. My essentials list reflects this variety: There are eight shorts, sixteen features, and one serial. The sixteen features on my list have running times from 50 minutes to almost 200 minutes, although the majority run between 50 and 65 minutes. [Side note: For purposes of this project, I am using the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences definition of a feature, that is, a film with a running time of 40 minutes or longer.]\n\nProduction in the 1910s also experienced seismic shifts. At the beginning of the decade, French companies controlled the vast majority of film production: Before World War I, 60–70% of films imported into the U.S. were French. Gaumont was the largest studio in the world, with Louis Feuillade in charge and cranking out his popular crime serials Fantômas (1913–14), Les Vampires (1915–16), and Judex. Also in Europe, Scandinavian directors began experimenting with narrative continuity and, in 1913, Victor Sjöström directed the social drama Ingeborg Holm, which used long takes, precise compositions, and nuanced performances in what is often considered the first true narrative feature.*\n\nAt the beginning of the decade in the United States, production was still based in New York and New Jersey and primarily controlled by the Edison Trust. It was here that the star system emerged when Carl Laemmle revealed the identity of “the Biograph girl” (aka Florence Lawrence) to the world. While the trust’s monopoly would eventually end the European domination of the industry—with a large assist from the onset of war—it was also one reason many independent filmmakers shifted production to the West Coast. In Los Angeles, not only was there abundant sunlight and diverse geography for exteriors, but the distance from New York made it harder for the trust to exert control through patents and fees. The trust would eventually be dismantled in 1918 in the wake of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. While the Hollywood studio system wouldn’t fully develop until the 1920s, by the war’s end, Los Angeles had become the epicenter of film production and directors such as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille had already made their mark there. More on them later.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these production developments also affected the distribution and exhibition of films. As the United States entered the 1910s, it was the age of the nickelodeon—the first type of dedicated indoor cinema space where patrons paid a nickel for entrance. However, as longer films became the norm, people wanted more comfortable venues for watching them, leading to the death of the nickelodeon and the rise of the cinema palace. These purposely built cinemas represented a full evening’s entertainment, and it is at this point that we see the establishment of the newsreel. Longer, narrative films also led to a shift in the use of intertitles: By the mid-1910s, dialogue intertitles had begun to outnumber expository titles, and the concept of screenwriter was born.\n\nIn short, this was a turbulent but exciting time for the industry. Nevertheless, I was somewhat dreading looking at the films of this period, mostly because I didn’t really know much about them beyond The Birth of a Nation (which I have deliberately excluded from consideration as part of this project). I had seen a few Chaplin shorts, I had watched Suspense when I originally got the Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers collection out of the library, and I had made it through the first couple of episodes of Les Vampires when I did my Great Unseen project back in 2017; however, everything else was new to me.\n\nDespite the fact that I think the 1910s is likely to be one of the weakest cinema decades when all is said and done, I’m happy to say I discovered some real gems.\n\nFavorite Feature Film: Shoes (1916) by Lois Weber. I first watched Shoes on Valentine’s Day 2020 and it was love at first sight. While ostensibly strictly a “social” film inspired by Jane Addams’s book A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil about the problems faced by underpaid working women, it is also a proto-Sex and the City that opens with our heroine crushing on a pair of shoes in a shop window. We eventually learn that our heroine wants them, not just for a fashion statement, but because she has worn out her own soles working in a five and dime. However, her family is destitute and all her earnings must go to support them. Like an O. Henry story gone very, very wrong, she eventually trades sex for the shoes. The story is great, if bleak, but this film also stands above the rest for its innovative camerawork.\n\nFavorite Director (Drama): Cecil B. DeMille. After Shoes, one of my favorite discoveries of the 1910s was DeMille’s Male and Female (1919), which quickly replaced The Cheat (1915) on my essentials list. Not that The Cheat isn’t good, it is, but I had seen a sound version of it previously and so I already knew the story. Plus, Male and Female is simply on another level, both technically and artistically. The film, which is a drama about gender relations, a satire of social class, and an adventure story all rolled into one, is based on a play by J. M. Barrie (of Peter Pan fame) and stars Gloria Swanson as a spoiled aristocrat who looks down on the attentions of her butler until she finds herself and her family stranded on a deserted island with him. It is best known for an elaborate fantasy sequence about ancient Babylon. If you are an opera lover, I would also recommend DeMille’s Carmen (1915), which stars American soprano Geraldine Farrar in the title role alongside film star Wallace Reid, popularly known as “the screen’s most perfect lover.”\n\nFavorite Director (Comedy): Ernst Lubitsch. This wasn’t even close. I really enjoyed all three Lubitsch features that I watched for this decade. My favorite was Die Puppe (The Doll) (1919), somewhat based on the ballet Coppélia, but also Hoffmann’s short story “Der Sandmann” (later adapted into the opera Les contes d’Hoffmann). Ossi Oswalda, the star of all three Lubitsch features I watched, is incredible here as the daughter of the dollmaker who acts as “the doll” hired by the protagonist to fool his rich uncle into thinking he has gotten married. In Ich möchte kein Mann sein (I Don’t Want to Be a Man) (1918), Oswalda is an independent young woman who enjoys both playing poker and smoking (heavens!). When a new strict guardian arrives, she sneaks out on the town disguised as a young man. However, she soon discovers that her newfound freedom is not all that it’s cracked up to be. Finally, there was The Oyster Princess (1919), about a spoiled rich girl who absolutely insists her father find her a royal husband. Hijinks ensue. I didn’t like the broad comedy of this one quite as much as the other Lubitsch films, but it has an incredible foxtrot scene towards the end that is certainly worth watching.\n\nFavorite Discovery: The Cameraman’s Revenge (1912) by Władysław Starewicz. I am no fan of animation, so I wondered whether I even wanted to include this Russian stop-motion animated short that uses dead insects as its protagonists, but it showed up on so many lists that I figured I’d give it a go. OMG! The detail! The drama! I’m linking to a subtitled version below since, if you’ve never seen this, you must watch it right now. It even contains the classic “movie with the movie” bit (which just goes to show you that almost nothing is truly new).\n\nFavorite Epic: Cabiria (1914) by Giovanni Pastrone. Where to begin? Cabiria is an Italian epic set during the Punic Wars with a plot revolving around a young girl (Cabiria) who gets separated from her family during the eruption of Mount Etna and later is kidnapped and taken to Carthage, where she is destined to be sacrificed to the god Moloch. Although she will continue to reappear, the story really isn’t focused on Cabiria but rather the great historical events of the day, including the alpine trek of Hannibal, the defeat of the Roman fleet at Syracuse, and Scipio’s North African campaign. In addition to being extremely entertaining (really, the 180 minutes just fly by), it is also extremely innovative, featuring the extensive use of a moving camera, including a type of dolly tracking shot initially referred to as a “Cabiria shot.” Cabiria was the first feature film shown at the White House and was a major influence on D.W. Griffith. I had already seen Intolerance by the time I watched Cabiria, and, frankly, Cabiria blows that film out of the water.\n\nFavorite “Social” Film: Traffic in Souls (1913) by George Loane Tucker. This is one of the first films of the decade I actually saw since I found it looking up which silent classics were on Kanopy. As shocking as it may sound for the time, Traffic in Souls is a frank crime melodrama about forced prostitution (aka white slavery). It is also one of the first examples of a narrative feature in the U.S. Like a number of social films during this decade, it takes on the plight of the naïve immigrant and the difficulties faced by working women. Gretchen the Greenhorn (1916), which stars Dorothy Gish, is another example of this genre, though a somewhat more romantic one. Both were enjoyable despite their grim subject matter, featuring exciting chase-and-rescue sequences. Gretchen the Greenhorn also features the legendary character actor Eugene Pallette, in an early role as the villain.\n\nFavorite Mary Pickford: The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917) by Maurice Tourneur. I watched a bunch of Mary Pickford films for this project, including some of her early shorts under the direction of D.W. Griffith at Biograph, the best of which is The New York Hat (1912), from a screenplay by Anita Loos, and co-starring Lionel Barrymore. However, although Stella Maris (a 1918 film where Pickford plays the dual roles of wealthy invalid and orphan servant) is surely her acting tour de force, I have a fondness for The Poor Little Rich Girl, where she plays a fun-loving but neglected daughter of rich parents. This feature, adapted by Frances Marion from a Broadway play, was a certified box office hit. The production used forced perspective and other tricks to make it appear that the diminutive Pickford was an eleven-year-old girl. Unfortunately, the success of the film meant that Pickford got pigeon-holed in child roles for much of the rest of her career, even playing the lead in Little Annie Rooney in 1925, at the age of 33.\n\nFavorite Film That Changed the Course of Film History: Snow White (1916) by J. Searle Dawley. Snow White was another pleasant surprise. One reason I watched this was that it apparently had a major influence on Walt Disney, who saw this movie as a teen in Kansas City and recalled it as “a perfect story.” But, influence aside, I really like this version of the tale, which is based on a 1912 stage production where the witch and the evil stepmother are separate characters. Fun fact: The dwarves in this version are named Blick, Flick, Glick, Snick, Plick, Whick, and Quee. Dawley also directed the earliest known screen adaptation of Frankenstein in 1910, which you can find on YouTube but I wouldn’t particularly recommend (see below).\n\nFavorite Film to Feature a National Park: The Dragon Painter (1919) by William Worthington. I’m not sure how I stumbled upon the existence of The Dragon Painter, but when I saw that the library had a DVD copy, I jumped on it. The story is a sort of fairy-tale about a young Japanese painter who lives in the mountains and believes his true love has been captured and turned into a dragon. A visiting surveyor sees his artwork and convinces the painter to go to Tokyo to be mentored by a celebrated artist he knows (by telling the painter that his dragon love can be found there). There, the painter falls in love with his mentor’s daughter, but loses his ability to paint. Hijinks and much melodrama ensue. The film stars Japanese acting power couple, Sessue Hayakawa and Tsuru Aoki, and was produced by Hayakawa, who had risen to fame as the star of Cecil B. DeMille’s The Cheat. The easter egg for me was when I started the film and slowly but surely realized the painter lived in Yosemite National Park!\n\nFavorite Hero: Judex (1916) by Louis Feuillade. As I noted in my post on Considering the Essentials, I had watched the first few episodes of Feuillade’s Les Vampires (1915–16) during my The Great Unseen project, but I just couldn’t get into it at that time. However, I knew I should watch at least one of Feuillade’s serials for this decade and so chose Judex. Judex was a direct response to Feuillade’s earlier serials, which focused on criminal gangs and had been criticized for glorifying crime. With the character of Judex (Latin for judge), Feuillade essentially created a proto-Batman, a character who, in response to the death of his father, decides to make his life’s work seeking revenge on a villainous financier and his network. He has a secret identity and lair, multiple gadgets and disguises, and mad fighting skillz. Of course, along the way, he falls in love with the banker’s innocent daughter. The total length of this serial is five hours, but they really do fly by, in part because of the fantastic characters we meet along the way. My favorite was Le Môme réglisse, aka The Licorice Kid.\n\nThe Genre of the Decade: The Western\n\nLike many genres, the western has been around since almost the beginning of film history, with Edwin S. Porter’s The Great Train Robbery appearing in 1903 and The Story of the Kelly Gang, an Australian bushranger film often considered the world’s first full-length narrative feature,* appearing in 1906. [Side note: Unfortunately, only 17 minutes of the latter film are known to have survived.] About 1908 or so, the popularity of the genre exploded and, by 1910, one-reel westerns would account for 25 percent of U.S. production. Part of me actually wonders if the popularity of westerns is one reason for the industry’s move out to California, where obviously location shooting for this genre would be greatly facilitated. In any case, I love westerns, so I was happy to find so many during this period.\n\nThough he wasn’t the first to make them, the producer most associated with the western genre is Thomas Ince. Ince leant a new authenticity to the genre, notably by bringing in Native Americans (primarily Oglala Sioux) to play Native American roles—groundbreaking! In 1912, he purchased a ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains, which would become his first studio, featuring stages and elaborate sets, offices and prop houses, and even labs for printing film. Sadly, his legacy as Hollywood’s first producer and studio head has been overshadowed by his death after a trip on the yacht of William Randolph Hearst. For this project, I watched one of his early pictures, The Invaders (1912), a very serviceable cavalry western.\n\nWith the emergence of multi-reel westerns in the middle of the decade, one actor emerged as a key player: William S. Hart, often an uncredited director on his films. Even though he was almost fifty at his film debut, Hart had starred in a number of westerns on the stage. In 1915, Hart began production on Hell’s Hinges (1916), nominally directed by Charles Swickard, but helmed by both Hart and producer Ince. Hell’s Hinges was Hart’s sixth feature and one of the most famous of the early westerns (along with The Virginian, by Cecil B. DeMille). The film has a slow build, as an East Coast preacher moves out to a wild frontier town and gradually becomes corrupted by some of the locals who are plotting to get rid of him. In the meantime, one of the local gunslingers falls in love with the preacher’s sister. It all ends in a literal blaze of glory and/or hellfire, take your pick.\n\nHell’s Hinges was one of five westerns to make their way onto either my essentials list or my favorites list. The others were Le Railway de la mort (The Railway of Death) (1912), a dark western from France that reminded me of Frank Norris’s McTeague; ’49-’17 (1917) a light western that plays on nostalgia for the Old West (and directed by a woman who hails from my hometown!); Bucking Broadway (1917), an early John Ford western that starts off with the beautiful landscapes of the West and ends up with horses galloping through Manhattan; and Out West (1918), a two-reel western comedy directed by Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle and co-starring Buster Keaton. I also watched Wild and Woolly (1917), another comedy, written by Anita Loos and starring Douglas Fairbanks, and The Battle of Elderbush Gilch (1913), directed by D.W. Griffith. Like many of Griffith’s films, the basic plot was good but you have to be willing to overlook the egregious racism to appreciate it. (I’m not willing.)\n\nPersonal Highs and Lows\n\nOne of the pleasant surprises for me in this decade was the strong presence of women. To start with, there are the directors: Alice Guy-Blaché, who was head of production at Gaumont until her marriage and founded her own studio in the U.S. in 1912; Lois Weber, who by the middle of the decade was Universal’s highest-paid director; and Mabel Normand, who was the first to direct Charlie Chaplin’s tramp character. Additionally, about half of all films written before 1925 were written by women. In fact, from 1915 to 1935, Frances Marion, who had been discovered by Lois Weber, was the highest paid screenwriter of all, eventually winning two Oscars in the 1930s (The Big House, The Champ). Finally, in a field that would long be dominated by women, there was editing. Perhaps the best known editor of the period is Margaret Booth, the editor for D.W. Griffith.\n\nI like to direct, because I believe a woman, more or less intuitively, brings out many of the emotions that are rarely expressed on the screen. I may miss what some of the men get, but I will get other effects that they never thought of.\n\n—Lois Weber (Lois Weber in Early Hollywood, p. 72)\n\nSpeaking of Mabel Normand and Charlie Chaplin, I watched a lot of comedy shorts for this decade, many coming out of Keystone Productions, where both Normand and Chaplin got their start under Mack Sennett. I also watched some early Harold Lloyd shorts directed by Hal Roach. I have to say, not being a huge vaudeville/slapstick fan, I don’t really “love” any of these, but, if that is your sort of thing, I think you would like most any of the following: Mabel’s Dramatic Career, Mabel’s Blunder, Mabel’s Busy Day, The New Janitor, Dough & Dynamite, Mabel and Fatty’s Wash Day, One A.M., The Rink, A Dog’s Life, Bumping into Broadway.\n\nAnd, at long last, we get to D.W. Griffith. I haven’t said much about him here because, frankly, I didn’t really like most of his features in this decade. I tried to watch The Birth of a Nation but turned it off after about fifteen or twenty minutes because I found it so utterly boring that I thought, “Why stick it out just to get to the super racist parts?” Broken Blossoms is a powerful story with some fantastic acting by Lillian Gish, but also incredibly racist and disturbingly violent. Intolerance is a tremendous spectacle but I don’t think it holds a candle to Cabiria. In fact, given that he didn’t actually invent the many things he gave himself credit for (close-ups, cross-cutting, etc.) and that others mistakenly credit to him as “firsts” even to this day, I even considered removing him from the essentials list altogether; however, I didn’t think I would quite get away with that. And I would recommend some of his shorts, including The Girl and Her Trust, The Musketeers of Pig Alley, and The New York Hat. In any case, we will be talking about Griffith again for the 1920s.\n\nFinally, a few adaptations that I was looking forward to but ultimately missed the mark. Oddly enough, these films were all released in 1910. They are all about a dozen minutes long.\n\nAs noted above, J. Searle Dawley, the director of Snow White, directed the earliest known Frankenstein. Like another adaptation of his the same year, A Christmas Carol, I could follow the story, but only because I knew it, and there were a lot of missed opportunities. In both, however, he was able to do interesting things with effects. Still, I thought R.W. Paul’s Scrooge, or Marley’s Ghost (1901), which is the first known use of intertitles, did a much better job at condensing Dickens in half the time. In a similar way, Edwin S. Porter’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is a fun version of the Lewis Carroll story with great effects, but it really could have used better intertitles to tell the story for those unfamiliar with it. Lastly, if you want to see some truly bizarre sh*t, check out The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by Otis Turner. This is the first surviving film of the Oz story and the story is surreal: the scarecrow is alive from the beginning in Kansas, Toto is a big puppet dog (and there’s also a cow and a mule for some reason), everyone line dances at one point, and the finale features an appearance by the unionized women workers of Emerald City.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nIn addition to the resources listed in my original post on the subject back in January 2020, for this period of cinema history, I highly recommend the documentary Dawson City: Frozen Time, currently streaming on both The Criterion Channel and Kanopy. The documentary tells the tale of the discovery in the 1970s of a treasure trove of silent films buried in the permafrost of the Yukon Territory and explains how and why they got there.\n\nFor podcast lovers, check out Karina Longworth’s You Must Remember This podcast. In 2018, she did a whole series on fact-checking Kenneth Anger’s Hollywood Babylon, which included episodes on D.W. Griffith, Fatty Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, and Thomas Ince.\n\nFor more on Lois Weber, see Shelley Stamp, Lois Weber in Early Hollywood (UC Press, 2015).\n\nFinally, a boxed set that didn’t make my original post: Lubitsch in Berlin by Kino Lorber. This includes seven early Lubitsch features, including the three I discuss above.\n\nEssential Films of the 1910s\n\nAfgrunden (The Abyss) (Gad, 1910)\n\nThe Cameraman’s Revenge (Starewicz, 1912)\n\nA Fool and His Money (Guy-Blaché, 1912)\n\nLe Railway de la mort (The Railway of Death) (Durand, 1912)\n\nIngeborg Holm (Sjöström, 1913)\n\nSuspense (Weber/Smalley, 1913)\n\nTraffic in Souls (Tucker, 1913)\n\nCabiria (Pastrone, 1914)\n\nMabel’s Blunder (Normand, 1914)\n\nHell’s Hinges (Smith/Hart/Swickard, 1916)\n\nIntolerance (Griffith, 1916)\n\nJudex (Feuillade, 1916)\n\nShoes (Weber, 1916)\n\nSnow White (Dawley, 1916)\n\nBucking Broadway (Ford, 1917)\n\nThe Immigrant (Chaplin, 1917)\n\nThe Poor Little Rich Girl (Tourneur, 1917)\n\nTerje Vigen (A Man There Was) (Sjöström, 1917)\n\nOut West (Arbuckle, 1918)\n\nStella Maris (Neilan, 1918)\n\nLa Cigarette (The Cigarette) (Dulac, 1919)\n\nThe Dragon Painter (Worthington, 1919)\n\nJ’accuse (I Accuse) (Gance, 1919)\n\nMale and Female (DeMille, 1919)\n\nDie Puppe (The Doll) (Lubitsch, 1919)\n\nFor those that took up my Century+ challenge oh so long ago, did you manage to see anything on my essentials list?

Said to have an original running time of 70 minutes, only 17 minutes are known to survive. Therefore, it is hard to know if it is truly a narrative feature. Otherwise, I have found no mention of any other films of this length until the 1910s.\n\nNote to email subscribers, there is embedded video in this post that may not appear in your email. Please click through to the actual post to see the complete list of selections.\n\nIt’s true! At long last I am getting back to my Century+ project. This past January, I managed to catch all the “essential” films I had planned on watching for the 1910s and I’m ready to state whether or not they are indeed essential. [SPOILER ALERT: #NotAllEssentials]\n\nBefore we get to my overview of the decade, however, I wanted to spend a minute or two considering the very idea of essentials. One reason for the delay in posting about my “January” films is that I went back and forth on whether my final essentials list for each decade should remain at twenty-five selections or not. I thought having a list of three hundred films was rather unwieldy—and it certainly is in some ways—so I initially decided that, as I went through the year, I would cut each decade’s list down to ten films, for a final total of 125 films, or approximately one film for each year of cinema history.\n\nThis was fairly easy for the first couple of decades, however, once I started thinking about what I would do for the 1920s, I realized that cutting down the lists like this would somewhat defeat one of my main purposes in undertaking this Century+ survey, that is, coming up with a more diverse list of essentials than one usually finds out in the wild (Sight & Sound, I’m looking at you). Of course, just by spreading the films out over the entirety of cinema history there would be selections you don’t usually find on these lists,* but, in cutting the number so drastically, it was going to be difficult to include the wider array of films I had planned on.\n\nAt the same time, as I started to finalize my list for the 1910s, and think about the one for the 1920s, I realized I was constantly wanting to include personal favorites. Sort of how favorite films always sneak into my Oscar Pool selections, even if I know they don’t realistically have a chance of winning. I just can’t bear to leave a movie I loved out of the running. This problem became more acute when paring the lists down even further.\n\nOf course, this is a problem for any “best of” cinema list: Do I take into consideration the enjoyment a film might provide me (or anyone else), or do I only consider its “importance” or “quality” (however I decide that might be judged)? Both aspects seem important since another purpose of this project is to emerge from it with ready answers to questions like “What are the top five films of the 1950s?” or “What are your three favorite westerns?”\n\nIn the end, I decided to keep my essentials list at twenty-five films per decade, for a total of three hundred, and I also created a new series of lists, one for each decade starting with the 1910s. These decade lists will rank my twenty-five favorite films of the decade, whether they are deemed “essential” or not. You can find links to each list in progress on my main essentials list. [Side note: I also have an ongoing ranked list of silent films that covers every feature of the silent era that I have watched in the last five years.]\n\nSo, the basic plan for each decade is to make a list of twenty-five films that are seen as canon, watch them if I haven’t, and decide whether or not I agree. At the same time, I have a number of additional films I will try to get to if I can, and I will consider whether or not they (or anything else I have already seen) deserve to supplant what is on the canonical list. The twenty-five films that best represent the decade in cinema will go on the final essentials list and my twenty-five favorites will go on a separate ranked decade list.\n\nLet’s see exactly what that means when it comes to the 1910s.\n\nMy original list of essentials was as follows:\n\nAfgrunden (The Abyss) (Gad, 1910)\n\nL’Inferno (Dante’s Inferno) (Bertolini, 1911)\n\nÀ la conquête du pôle (The Conquest of the Pole) (Méliès, 1912)\n\nThe Cameraman’s Revenge (Starewicz, 1912)\n\nIngeborg Holm (Sjöström, 1913)\n\nSuspense (Weber/Smalley, 1913)\n\nTraffic in Souls (Tucker, 1913)\n\nCabiria (Pastrone, 1914)\n\nThe Cheat (DeMille, 1915)\n\nA Fool There Was (Powell, 1915)\n\nLes Vampires (Feuillade, 1915)\n\nHell’s Hinges (Smith/Hart/Swickard, 1916)\n\nIntolerance (Griffith, 1916)\n\nThe Ocean Waif (Guy-Blaché, 1916)\n\nOne A.M. (Chaplin, 1916)\n\nShoes (Weber, 1916)\n\nSnow White (Dawley, 1916)\n\nWhere Are My Children? (Weber/Smalley, 1916)\n\nTerje Vigen (A Man There Was) (Sjöström, 1917)\n\nThe Poor Little Rich Girl (Tourneur, 1917)\n\nStella Maris (Neilan, 1918)\n\nLa Cigarette (The Cigarette) (Dulac, 1919)\n\nJ’accuse (I Accuse) (Gance, 1919)\n\nDie Puppe (The Doll) (Lubitsch, 1919)\n\nDie Austernprinzessin (The Oyster Princess) (Lubitsch, 1919)\n\nSome of these titles were mentioned in my film books (though I have very little on silent film), others I came across doing further research, and still others were added after watching the first segment of The Story of Film. Some were added simply because I knew I would be able to watch them in the boxed sets I took out of the library and mentioned in my resources post. All in all, I think it was a good list to start with. However, as I watched, it was clear I would need to make some alterations to it.\n\nIn the first place, I switched out Les Vampires (which I just couldn’t get into) for Judex (1916), another multi-episode crime serial by Louis Feuillade. Judex is lesser known, but I had read good things about it and, in fact, ended up liking it enormously. Otherwise, I watched all the films on the original list.\n\nA few of these films came off the list immediately after watching them because I really, really didn’t like them and they weren’t innovative enough to keep despite that. These are L’Inferno (Dante’s Inferno), A Fool There Was, and Where Are My Children? [Side note: It’s a real shame that most of Theda Bara’s films are considered lost, because I did like her “vamp” character in A Fool There Was, I just didn’t like the film itself. Like many silent film fans, I would love to see her Cleopatra.]\n\nA few other films got replaced by better examples of the directors in question. DeMille’s The Cheat made way for his Male and Female (1919), Chaplin’s One A.M. got bumped for The Immigrant (1917), and Alice Guy-Blaché’s A Fool and His Money (1912) replaced The Ocean Waif. In the two former cases, I not only preferred the final selections but thought they had more to say overall. In the latter case, it was simply a question of historical importance: A Fool and His Money is the oldest known film with an all-Black cast. Ever the pioneer, our Alice.\n\nOther films I came across that I decided had to be added were Le Railway de la mort (The Railway of Death) (1912), a bleak French western short shot in the Camargue; Mabel’s Blunder (1914), a gender-bending comic short directed by former Gibson Girl turned comedienne turned Keystone director Mabel Normand; Bucking Broadway (1917), an early John Ford western that features a finale with horses galloping through New York City; Out West (1918), a very fun, smart send-up of westerns starring Buster Keaton and Fatty Arbuckle; and The Dragon Painter (1918), a Hollywood motion picture partly filmed in Yosemite, but set in Japan and starring the Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa, who also produced the film. These new additions unfortunately also meant knocking À la conquête du pôle (The Conquest of the Pole) and Die Austernprinzessin (The Oyster Princess) off the original list.\n\nHere is my final chronological list of essentials for the 1910s:\n\nAfgrunden (The Abyss) (Gad, 1910)\n\nThe Cameraman’s Revenge (Starewicz, 1912)\n\nA Fool and His Money (Guy-Blaché, 1912)\n\nLe Railway de la mort (The Railway of Death) (Durand, 1912)\n\nIngeborg Holm (Sjöström, 1913)\n\nSuspense (Weber/Smalley, 1913)\n\nTraffic in Souls (Tucker, 1913)\n\nCabiria (Pastrone, 1914)\n\nMabel’s Blunder (Normand, 1914)\n\nHell’s Hinges (Smith/Hart/Swickard, 1916)\n\nIntolerance (Griffith, 1916)\n\nJudex (Feuillade, 1916)\n\nShoes (Weber, 1916)\n\nSnow White (Dawley, 1916)\n\nBucking Broadway (Ford, 1917)\n\nThe Immigrant (Chaplin, 1917)\n\nThe Poor Little Rich Girl (Tourneur, 1917)\n\nTerje Vigen (A Man There Was) (Sjöström, 1917)\n\nOut West (Arbuckle, 1918)\n\nStella Maris (Neilan, 1918)\n\nLa Cigarette (The Cigarette) (Dulac, 1919)\n\nThe Dragon Painter (Worthington, 1919)\n\nJ’accuse (I Accuse) (Gance, 1919)\n\nMale and Female (DeMille, 1919)\n\nDie Puppe (The Doll) (Lubitsch, 1919)\n\nAnd here is my ranked list of twenty-five favorites for the 1910s:\n\nThe Cameraman’s Revenge (Starewicz, 1912)\n\nDie Puppe (The Doll) (Lubitsch, 1919)\n\nShoes (Weber, 1916)\n\nJudex (Feuillade, 1916)\n\nMale and Female (DeMille, 1919)\n\nThe Dragon Painter (Worthington, 1919)\n\nSnow White (Dawley, 1916)\n\nTraffic in Souls (Tucker, 1913)\n\nCabiria (Pastrone, 1914)\n\n’49-’17 (Baldwin, 1917)\n\nLa Cigarette (The Cigarette) (Dulac, 1919)\n\nStella Maris (Neilan, 1918)\n\nGretchen the Greenhorn (C.

(Newmeyer & Taylor, 1923)\n\nGreed (Stroheim, 1924)\n\nThe Thief of Bagdad (Walsh, 1924)\n\nBen-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (Niblo & Brabin, 1925)\n\nThe Big Parade (Vidor, 1925)\n\nBody and Soul (Micheaux, 1925)\n\nBronenosets Potyomkin (Battleship Potemkin) (Eisenstein, 1925)\n\nThe Gold Rush (Chaplin, 1925)\n\nLady Windermere’s Fan (Lubitsch, 1925)\n\nDie Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (The Adventures of Prince Achmed)\n\n(Reiniger, 1926)\n\nThe General (Keaton, 1926)\n\nKonets Sankt-Peterburga (The End of St. Petersburg) (Pudovkin, 1927)\n\nMetropolis (Lang, 1927)\n\nNapoléon vu par Abel Gance (Napoléon) (Gance, 1927)\n\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans (Murnau, 1927)\n\nWings (Wellman, 1927)\n\nLa Coquille et le clergyman (The Seashell and the Clergyman) (Dulac, 1928)\n\nLa Passion de Jeanne d’Arc (The Passion of Joan of Arc) (Dreyer, 1928)\n\nChelovek s kino-apparatom (The Man with a Movie Camera) (Vertov, 1929)\n\nUn chien andalou (An Andalusian Dog) (Buñuel, 1929)\n\nAgain, these are the films that I have determined are considered “canon” for the decade, based on film books, major critical lists such as the Sight & Sound 250 and the AFI Top 100, and other research.\n\nTune in at the end of the month to see what makes my final lists!\n\nFor the next post in this Century+ series, click below:\n\nA Century+ of Cinema: The 1910s\n\nFor previous posts in this Century+ series, click below:\n\nFilm 101—A Century+ Silent Film Resources\n\nA Century+ of Cinema: The Early Silents, 1895–1909\n\nFor my film lists, click below:\n\nA Century+: The Essentials\n\nA Century+: Silent Films\n\nA Century+: Favorites of the 1910s\n\n*There are only four silent movies on the AFI list and only twenty-one on the Sight & Sound 250, and of course, the Oscars only start up just at the end of the silent period.\n\nWhen I was first putting my Century+ project together, I hesitated over how to divide up the silent period, or whether even to divide it up at all. I ended up deciding to cover the first fifteen years of cinema history, from 1895 to 1909, as one “decade” and then look at the 1910s separately in February. Of course, that was when I thought this post would actually go up in January. Thank god we have one extra day in February this year.\n\nIn any case, this division seemed to make sense, since in my initial research it looked like the year 1909 served as a transitional year, when films shifted significantly in length, moving from being extremely short shorts (1–6 min), to more of a mid-length short (12–15 min). I have since realized that that is not exactly the case and the cut-off year for this decade is really just as arbitrary in terms of film content and style as any other decade.\n\nBesides covering more than ten years of cinema production, this post will also be different from my other decade posts in months to come because it is really more about the industry than the films themselves. Because, while I enjoy watching (some of) these films, and would certainly consider many of them essential, they are not generally going to make anyone’s top ten list of all time.*\n\nSo, a bit of cinema history…\n\nBirthplace(s) of Cinema\n\nThere are numerous national claims to being responsible for the first film, but any consideration of the early silent era basically comes down to two countries—France and the United States. In the United States, with the development of the Kinetograph and Kinetoscope in 1891–1893 by Thomas Edison and William Dickson, we see the first moving pictures, albeit in the form of a peepshow device available to only one person at a time. In France, with the Lumière brothers’ first projection of films for an audience in March 1895, and then a paying public in December of that same year, we see the birth of cinema, that is, the experience of watching films together in the dark.\n\nFrench Industrialists and Innovators\n\nWe begin in France since it is developments there that are responsible for the spread of this technology and form of entertainment so quickly across the globe and French production companies dominate the industry until the early 1910s.\n\nAuguste and Louis Lumière\n\nThe cinématographe, which gave its name to the new medium, was invented in Lyon, France, by Auguste and Louis Lumière, the two eldest sons of Charles-Antoine Lumière, a photographer by trade. When his sons were rather young, Charles-Antoine had opened a factory to produce photographic plates; however, he wasn’t very successful until his sons returned from technical school and essentially took it over. While still in his teens, Louis invented and patented a new type of photographic plate that reduced the need for darkroom development, essentially setting up the Lumière company (and families) for life. It was his father, however, who first saw moving pictures in a Kinetoscope and encouraged his sons to figure out a way to improve upon that invention.\n\nOf course, the Lumière brothers were not the only inventors to be working on developing a mechanism to project moving pictures—other pioneers include Max Skladanowsky who debuted his invention in Berlin in late 1895—however, the brothers’ invention had three key advantages over its competitors: 1) the camera served as both a projector and film developer; 2) it was hand-cranked and illuminated by limelight and so did not rely on electric current; and 3) it was relatively light. This meant that the cinématographe was much more portable and adaptable than anything else on the market. The brothers further capitalized on these advantages by training twenty or so cameramen/projectionists to go out and make and show motion pictures on site throughout France and abroad. Not only did this put their incredible machines on display for a larger number of people, but it also provided a large supply of varied films.\n\nThe Lumière brothers referred to their films as actualités, which is a word used today for the news, and is usually translated as documentaries, but they are not what we think of as documentaries today. Rather, these films, which are all about fifty seconds long (because that’s how much film stock could fit in the camera), mostly document scenes and events of daily life: a train arriving at a train station, two parents feeding a baby, or simply workers leaving the Lumière factory. That is not to say these films don’t tell stories, one of the most famous Lumière films is L’Arroseur arrosé, a short comic play in which a boy plays a trick on a gardener, and which Louis filmed in three different versions, my favorite being Arroseur et arrosé (1897), where the gardener delivers a little payback.\n\nIn all these films, like most others of the early period, the camera remains in a fixed position, but, given the photography background of the brothers, these images display a strong command of black & white photography and sense of composition within the frame, often playing with diagonals and planes. Two of my favorite films of theirs do this: Lancement d’un navire (The Launching of a Ship), which use three planes of depth of field (the foreground of the crowd, the middle ground of the ship, and the background of the people on the other side as the ship slips away into the water) and Laveuses sur la rivière, which has three vertical planes of action. In many ways, the Lumière films are the “prettiest” of the early films. [Side note: I was wondering how the clip I picked out below was so much sharper than other versions I found online and then Ricky alerted me to this, so maybe the same thing was done here? Anyway, it was the composition choice I wanted to highlight.\n\nOf course, for the first audiences, just seeing these everyday events depicted on screen was a visual spectacle in and of itself. Although, despite reports to the contrary, audiences did not flee in terror at the sight of the oncoming train in L’Arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat.\n\nTop Ten Lumière Films Ranked:\n\nL’Arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat (1896)\n\nL’Arroseur arrosé (Tables Turned on the Gardener) (1895)\n\nLaveuses sur la rivière (1897)\n\nLancement d’un navire (1896)\n\nBarque sortant du port (1895)\n\nWater-to-bogant (Montagnes russes sur l’eau) (1896)\n\nDanse serpentine (1897)\n\nQuai de l’Archevêché (1896)\n\nBataille de boules de neige (Snowball Fight) (1896)\n\nSortie d’usine (Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory) (1895)\n\nGeorges Méliès\n\nGeorges Méliès, a magician by trade, and one of the first to see the cinématographe in action, immediately saw the potential of this new invention. By 1896–97, he had established a production company and built his own studio just outside Paris. Of all the French film pioneers, Méliès was simultaneously the "
