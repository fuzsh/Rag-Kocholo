Robertson IV\n\n• African Americans in Film\n\n• African Americans in Television\n\n• Filmography of Selected Feature Films and Documentaries\n\n• Actors, Filmmakers, and Film and Television Executives\n\n• Award Winners\n\nAs the foremost medium for creative expression, cinema yields a great deal of power and influence in defining images that shape humanity. Although primarily seen as a form of entertainment, it plays a significant role in the manner in which society views itself and the world around it. With regards to the representation of African Americans in cinema, the medium has largely failed in illuminating images that reflect the complete diversity of that experience. Instead, it has largely focused on images that devalue African Americans by confining their representation within an ideological web of myths, stereotypes, and caricatures.\n\nThe experiences of African Americans in television have been somewhat less limiting than those realized in film. This has been due, in part, to the fact that television sought to capture an African American audience from the outset. In fact, many of the medium’s earliest participants such as Steve Allen publicly stated that the medium’s success would certainly benefit by the inclusion of African American performers. Therefore, beginning with the medium’s widespread use in the late 1940s and into the present day, television has provided some unique avenues of expression for African Americans in acting, production, and executive roles.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICANS IN FILM\n\nTHE SILENT FILM ERA\n\nBeginning with the inception of the “moving camera” in the 1890s, African American images in cinema have been positioned, marginalized, and subordinated in every possible manner to glorify and relentlessly hold to America’s status quo. In 1898, the first African Americans appeared in film as soldiers heading for battle in the Spanish-American War. Soon afterwards though, the depiction of African Americans began to mirror the racial stereotypes of that time, appearing as criminals, ministers, and, during the period in which American society grew sentimental for the Civil War era, as slaves. The most provocative film of the era in which African Americans were depicted in servitude was D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation (1915).\n\nReleased at the end of the silent film era, The Birth of a Nation unleashed a tremendous amount of ire and controversy that is still discussed in cinematic circles. Although its release represented a technical and artistic triumph for the film community, its unabashed message of racial intolerance and embellished, stereotypical images of African Americans has become symbolic of the tremendous obstacles that African Americans face in cinema. Although other films such as Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1909) and The Nigger (1915) drew upon the same anti-African American propaganda, The Birth of a Nation, due to its technological significance, stands out as a fundamental reference to cinema’s position on African American images.\n\nREDEFINING AFRICAN AMERICAN IMAGES\n\nIn response to the popularity of such films, African Americans during the 1910s and 1920s formed independent film projects and production companies in order to create more realistic images of the African American culture.\n\nPerhaps the best known African American filmmaker of this period is Oscar Micheaux, who managed to generate financial profits from more than 30 silent and sound features that his private studio released. Utilizing a similar distribution system to that created by African American film producer Noble Johnson, Micheaux personally delivered films to movie theaters across the country, edited films on the road, and obtained money from theater owners by having actors give private performances from scenes of upcoming releases. Despite the fact that many of his films suffered from poor technical skills, Micheaux’s expert abilities as a promoter earned him a sizeable following. (Always daring, Micheaux turned the tables on Hollywood by casting his light-skinned actors to play whites in several of his films.) In 1924 the Micheaux movie Body and Soul featured Paul Robeson in his film debut.\n\nAfter recovering from bankruptcy, Micheaux released The Exile in 1931—the first African American feature-length sound movie—and God’s Stepchildren (1937), among other “talkies.” As tastes began to shift from what were called “race productions” though, Micheaux saw his audience dwindle. His final film released in 1948, a three-hour epic titled The Betrayal, was a commercial failure. While many of his films have been lost, Micheaux maintained control of his prized works, ensuring that they were protected as the legal property of his wife.\n\nThere were other African American pioneer film-makers of this time period—some of whose efforts predated Micheaux’s. William “Bill” Foster began using “all-colored” casts in a number of short films in 1913. Through his Foster Photoplay Company, he released several films, the most notable of which were The Railroad Porter, The Butler, and The Grafter and the Maid. Although Foster genuinely believed in the viability of launching an African American movie company, attempting to secure technical and financial support, not to mention distribution outlets, soon brought about his company’s demise.\n\nHeaded by Noble Johnson, the Lincoln Motion Picture Company, which was established in the summer of 1915, was perhaps the first company to produce significant films featuring black performers for African American audiences. The company released several films that depicted African Americans in a common, natural manner. In response to distribution problems that often plagued African American studios, Johnson worked out a commission system that engaged African American media personnel across the United States to utilize their business relationships with movie theater owners and show his films. By doing so, Johnson was able to produce such films as The Realization of a Negro’s Ambition (1916), The Trooper of Company K (1917), and The Law of Nature (1918). Though somewhat successful, this system could not compete with major Hollywood studios, and after Johnson’s defection to Universal Films, the company soon folded.\n\nAnother early African American film pioneer was Emmett J. Scott. A former secretary to Tuskegee Institute founder Booker T. Washington, Scott believed that African American cinema could be financially supported through the sale of stock in his production company. Incorporated in July 1916, his Birth of a Race Photoplay Corporation produced The Birth of a Race and released the film in December 1918. Although the film did not meet original expectations, it did succeed in establishing a capital-raising tool that would prove instrumental to future African American filmmakers.\n\nIn addition, many other African American entrepreneurs took the gamble on producing films with varying degrees of success. The Frederick Douglass Film Company premiered its first film The Colored American Winning His Suit in 1916. In 1920, the Royal Gardens Film Company presented In the Depths of Our Hearts, and in 1921 the ex-heavyweight champion Jack Johnson starred in As the World Rolls On for Andlauer Productions. In each case, however, the African American entrepreneurs behind these ventures succumbed to the insurmountable obstacles dealt to them because of racism.\n\nBREAKING INTO MAINSTREAM SOUND FILMS\n\nPrior to the sound era of cinema, many film producers used white actors in “blackface,” or burnt-cork makeup, to portray blacks. As a means of capturing the distinctive dialect and cadence of African Americans though, most producers began to employ African American actors for such limited roles during the new era of sound film. Though short “talkies” by other white filmmakers depicted African Americans in a more authentic manner, little else changed for African American performers, generally appearing as criminals and domestic servants, among other roles. In fact, the film widely heralded for utilizing sound in film The Jazz Singer (1927) starred exvaudevillian Al Jolson singing in “blackface.”\n\nOne favorable change for African American performers during this era was the establishment of the movie musical. From the late 1920s through the 1940s, countless movie musicals were made and featured African American performers. For the fortunate few, singing in a film was a real achievement—not only did it guarantee work on a project, but it also enabled performers to showcase broader talents. As the film community reveled in its latest trend, many multitalented African American performers—such as Lena Horne—were discovered.\n\nAlready gaining impressive notoriety for her beauty and singing talent, Horne’s film career actually began with the black independent film The Duke Is Tops as well as some short films. Lured to Hollywood in 1942 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a major role in Panama Hattie, Horne became the first African American performer awarded a major studio contract.\n\nLena Horne faced some unusual circumstances in Hollywood, though, due to her physical appearance. As a light-skinned African American with long flowing hair, she was viewed by many as something other than black. However, as a staunch supporter of her ethnicity, the actress refused to sacrifice pride in her heritage—such as playing demeaning roles as a slave or servant—for greater opportunities of film stardom. As a result, Horne only appeared in two other major films Cabin in the Sky and Stormy Weather. Beyond these works, Horne’s brief film career mostly consisted of musical numbers that could easily be edited in order to appease Southern viewing audiences.\n\nAnother notable performer whose breakthrough came during this era was actor Paul Robeson. Widely respected for his work as a stage actor, Robeson went on to play important roles in nine feature films between 1929 and 1942. By sheer force of talent and charisma, Robeson succeeded where many others had failed in consistently securing roles that were central to the theme of the film. In such classic dramas as The Emperor Jones, the musical Show Boat, and the British film The Proud Valley, Robeson created characters that challenged film barriers of that time. Unfortunately, the barriers of prejudice and stereotype continued to exist, and Robeson, after consistently being denied roles worthy of his talent, abandoned Hollywood to pursue a concert career.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN ACTORS ENDURE RACIAL STEREOTYPES\n\nThroughout the pantheon of early Hollywood cinema perhaps no other African American caricature was as well-entrenched as the “mammy” figure. Often the source of comic relief, these characters populated films from around 1914 through the late 1950s. No two performers better embodied that image than Louise Beavers and Hattie McDaniel, since physically, they both met the industry’s standards. Although Beavers and McDaniel both enjoyed lengthy film careers, neither was able to discard this stereotype. Beavers, who is best known for her role in the 1934 film version of Imitation of Life, also appeared in over 120 films. McDaniel, who earned an Academy Award in 1939 for her role in Gone with the Wind, appeared in more than 300 films. Despite the stereotypical roles that each performed, Beavers and McDaniel were both well-respected and seen as successful members of the Hollywood film community.\n\nBetween the late 1920s through the mid-1940s, many other African American performers were successful in establishing film careers. Although virtually all had to suffer through gross indignities in pursuit of careers, they nevertheless contributed to the growing African American presence in mainstream films. These actors and actresses included Earl “Rochester” Anderson, Rex Ingram, Ethel Waters, and Nina Mae McKinney.\n\nWORLD WAR II PROPAGANDA FILMS STRIVE FOR RACIAL HARMONY\n\nWith the advent of World War II, leaders of the Civil Rights movement of the early twentieth century seized the opportunity to press the U.S. government to address racial injustice including providing equal opportunity in wartime industry and the military. At the same time, such activist groups as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lobbied Hollywood for better film roles for African Americans.\n\nIn response, the U.S. War Department produced the groundbreaking film The Negro Soldier in 1944. At the same time, Hollywood produced movies that depicted a racially-integrated military, years before President Truman’s Executive Order No. 9981 mandated desegregation of the armed forces. For example, in Crash Dive, African American actor Ben Carter is shown saving the life of the film’s star, Tyrone Power. In the film Lifeboat African American actor Canada Lee is shown among a shipwrecked group of civilians whose ship has been destroyed by enemy fire.\n\nLater in the war, the U.S. government commissioned several short civilian films that expressed the theme of racial harmony. One such effort was The House I Live In, which won an Oscar Award for best short film in 1947. Documentaries of this period also reflected a liberal attitude toward race relations shortly after wartime. For example, documentarians Loeb and Levitt produced the work The Quiet One in 1948 that depicted the concerted effort put forth by white social workers in dealing with disadvantaged black juveniles.\n\nBLACKS IN POSTWAR AMERICAN FILMS\n\nFilms made in post-war America began to feature African Americans in multidimensional roles, as well as more integrated into American life. In fact, a number of films that were released in the late 1940s through the mid-1960s presented African Americans with families, careers, and working towards goals of a better life. Thus, Hollywood films sought, if only slightly, to broaden the scope of the African American experience. One significant cause was the increasing degree of political and economic influence wielded by the African American community.\n\nMaking his film debut in the 1950 drama No Way Out Sidney Poitier became the cinematic model for integration. Consistently depicted as an educated, intelligent, and well-mannered black man, Hollywood was quick to capitalize on Poitier’s appeal. With film credits that include Cry, the Beloved Country (1951), The Defiant Ones (1958), A Raisin in the Sun (1961), Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967), and In the Heat of the Night (1967), Poitier became Hollywood’s first bonafide African American film star. In 1963, he won the Academy Award in the best actor category—the first by an African American—for his lead role in Lilies of the Field.\n\nThough Poitier’s success symbolized the changing industry standards for African American performers during the course of the next two decades, his stardom did not come without a price. Although positioned as a leading actor, Poitier’s characterizations often lacked human dimension. For instance, in all but three of the films made during this period, Poitier was never allowed to exhibit any degree of sexuality. Nonetheless, Poitier’s career heralded greater acceptance of black actors as equals to their white counterparts.\n\nIn 1954, film actress Dorothy Dandridge became the first African American woman to be nominated for an Academy Award in the best actress category for her role in Carmen Jones. With unrivaled talent and beauty, it seemed that Dandridge would become the female counterpart to Poitier’s leading African American man. However, she was unable to ever find a subsequent role offering the same dimensions as Carmen Jones. While Dandridge repeatedly demonstrated dramatic ability and landed a respectable contract with Twentieth Century Fox, the industry mainly only cast her in films as an exotic native. When the pressures of battling the film industry proved too much, Dandridge drifted from the Hollywood scene and in 1965 died of an apparent suicide.\n\nIn the case of actor Harry Belafonte, Hollywood was faced with another dilemma. A naturally romantic hero, the film industry found it difficult to contain Belafonte’s sexuality. Similar to Dandridge whom he starred opposite in Carmen Jones and Island in the Sun, Belafonte’s career was therefore largely confined to playing an island native and other unflattering roles. After performing in Odds Against Tomorrow, The World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and Buck and the Preacher, Belafonte began a successful career as a concert performer and prominent civil rights spokesperson, selecting future film projects only with great discretion.\n\nMany other actors and actresses enjoyed success in films and mainstream acceptance. Among those who made a real impact during this period were Diana Sands, Ruby Dee, and Brock Peters. Along with Poitier, Dandridge, and Belafonte, their films marked the advent of the 1960s Civil Rights movement.\n\nBLAXPLOITATION FILMS\n\nDuring the 1960s Civil Rights movement and the war in Vietnam, American society was in the midst of a cultural revolution. As a result, films began to reflect the political and social changes brought about by the period’s harsh, challenging ideology. Director Melvin Van Peebles’s seminal 1971 African American-action film Sweet Sweet-back’s Baadasssss Song seemed to define, more than any other film, this era—one marked with contempt for white social order and its police.\n\nIn the wake of the enormous success of Peebles’s films, Hollywood rushed to produce similar movies that would capture this new African American audience. Although some of the African American action films, most notably Shaft (1971), Superfly (1972), and Coffy (1973), experienced a great deal of commercial success, this trend was soon dubbed “blaxploitation” by the African American media. In pursuit of increased profits though, Hollywood even remade blaxploitation films from classic horror movies—Blacula and Blackenstein, both in 1972.\n\nAlong with the popularity of African American action films was the emergence of a new wave of serious African American-oriented dramas. While most of these films failed to meet their initial expectations, a number of others did—the 1969 releases of The Learning Tree, Slaves, Putney Swope, and Sounder (1972) to name a few.\n\nFinally, more African Americans worked in Hollywood than ever before during this period—many behind the camera as well. Such screenwriters as Richard Wesley, Bill Gunn, and Lonne Elder and directors Gordon Parks Sr., Gordon Parks Jr., Michael Schultz, and Stan Lathan were all called upon to participate in the making of major studio films.\n\nTRANSITIONS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN FILM\n\nAlthough Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr.’s impact on the American music industry is legendary, little credit has been given to him as a film producer/director. Under his Motown Films banner, Gordy produced several films, the most successful being the 1972 release Lady Sings the Blues starring Diana Ross and Billy Dee Williams. Gordy’s pairing of them was the first time that African American performers were presented as romantic icons. Gordy’s 1976 film Mahogany was also the first to feature an African American actress as glamorous, independent, and sexual.\n\nAfrican American comedians were enjoying enormous film success as well. Richard Pryor emerged in the late 1970s as a film icon. Best known for his often provocative, iconoclastic stand-up routines, Pryor rose to superstardom through supporting role appearances. After appearing opposite Gene Wilder in the 1976 buddy film Silver Streak, Pryor continued to exhibit box-office clout in such films as Greased Lightning, Which Way Is Up, and Bustin’ Loose. He later returned to the stage where his two live concert films permanently sealed his position in film history. Other comedians, notably Eddie Murphy in the terrifically successful movie 48 Hours (1982) later benefitted from Pryor’s success.\n\nNEW AFRICAN AMERICAN CINEMA EMERGES\n\nTowards the mid-1980s African American actors and actresses appeared to be running on empty. With the roles offered by the blaxploitation era long gone, stereotypes of the past began to reemerge. The tragic mulatto, a well-used cinematic device once again appeared as such actresses as Rae Dawn Chong (American Flyers), Jennifer Beals (Flashdance), and Lisa Bonet (Angel Heart) were cast in roles that made no discernable mention of their ethnicity. In addition, the African American musical made a brief resurgence in the films Beat Street, Krush Groove, The Last Dragon, The Cotton Club, and Purple Rain.\n\nAnother trend that enjoyed renewed popularity in cinema was “buddy movies.” Although cinematic history is filled with various pairings of black and white performers,\n\nthe film industry in the 1980s perfected the trend with enormous box-office success. Some notable buddy film pairings included Carl Weathers and Sylvester Stallone in the Rocky films and Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series.\n\nMeanwhile, a low-budget independent film was released by a recent New York University Film School graduate named Spike Lee. The release She’s Gotta Have It resulted in the resurgence of African American cinema. Lee managed to gain large audiences for most of his commercial ventures and directed a string of successful Hollywood films including one of the most politically-charged films of the era, Do the Right Thing (1989).\n\nSpike Lee’s box-office successes, coupled with the achievements of University of Southern California Film School graduate John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood, Poetic Justice, and Rosewood) and comedian turned actor/director Robert Townsend, (Hollywood Shuffle and The Five Heartbeats) seemed to guarantee a viable future for African American filmmakers. Along with the filmmakers,\n\nAfrican American actors in Hollywood began to gain steady work.\n\nPROMISING FUTURE AWAITS AFRICAN AMERICANS IN FILM\n\nThe beginning of the new millenium showed great promise for African American talent in film. For the first time in history African American actors were able to establish solid careers in cinema. Among others, Angela Bassett, Halle Barry, Danny Glover, Whoopi Goldberg, Morgan Freeman, Samuel Jackson, Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy, Wesley Snipes, and Alfre Woodard created a lasting impact on the tapestry of film. A fresh and exciting new crop of talented actors like Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan, and directors Malcolm Lee, Patrick Famuyiwa, and Gina Prince-Bythewood, also seemed well on their way to major movie careers.\n\nThe proliferation of music artists crossing over into film had grown tremendously. Ice Cube, Queen Latifah, LL Cool J, and especially Will Smith built strongly on their pre-2000 track records. Their multi-media successes spawned opportunities for a new generation of music talent like rappers DMX (Exit Wounds) and Eve (Barbershop), as well as singer Beyoncé Knowles (Austin Powers in Gold-member) and the late Aaliyah (Queen of the Dammed).\n\nAction films also broke new ground, producing not one, but two stars of African American descent. The international success of films The Mummy Returns and Scorpion King turned World Wrestling Entertainment champion The Rock into a major star. Meanwhile the box office success of films like The Fast and the Furious and XXX catapulted Afro-Italian actor Vin Diesel into the exclusive $20 million club as an actor.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising change took place during the 2002 Academy Awards ceremony when Denzel Washington (Training Day) and Halle Berry (Monster’s Ball) each won Oscars for lead roles. Never had a black woman won for best actress, and only the great Sidney Poitier—40 years earlier—had received the best actor Oscar. As more African American performers gained responsibility for defining African American images in cinema, opportunities for black actors, filmmakers, and industry executives during the twenty-first century seemed to be very promising.\n\nNEW MILLENNIUM OPPORTUNITIES\n\nIn the year following Denzel Washington and Halle Berry’s historic wins at the Oscars, opportunities continued to remain mixed for African Americans in Hollywood. Although established talent like Will Smith, Denzel Washington and Queen Latifah continued to enjoyed robust job prospects within the film industry, the majority of African American talent was not as fortunate. With her Oscar in hand, even Halle Berry was unable to leverage the career options bestowed to her white counterparts. In the next year, however, represented a turn around to Black Hollywood with the release of several studio and independent films featuring African American themes and talent, the most notable of which was the film Ray. Starring Jamie Foxx and based on the life of the blind Soul music icon, the film was released in the US on October 29, 2004, the film earned more than $75,000,000 at the U.S. box office. Added to film’s financial success was an Oscar win for Foxx in the Best Actor category. Other notable films released in 2004 included: Hotel Rwanda, Woman Art Thou Lose, Brother to Brother and Badasssss.\n\nPerhaps one of the most important trends to be embraced by the African American film community has been the independent sphere of the film industry. Independent films were by definition films made outside the traditional studio system, although by the beginning of the millennium more studios set up “independent divisions” which guaranteed greater visibility and stronger box office. Oscar nominated director John Singleton was the first to make good use of the trend by producing the successful independent film Hustle & Flow in 2005. After earning over $25,000,000 at the U.S. box office, and\n\nmaking a mainstream star out of Terrence Howard, the film became a model that others in Black Hollywood began to follow, including a playwright name Tyler Perry.\n\nBuilding on his established following on the black theatre circuit in 2005, Perry partnered with the fledgling independent studio Lion’s Gate to release his first film Diary of A Mad Black Woman. Earning more than $50,000,000 at the U.S. box office the Perry film established the commercial viability of independent films. In 2006, Perry cemented the reach of black independent films when his second movie Madea’s Family Reunion earned over $60,000,000 a precedent setting sum for an African American film, independent or otherwise.\n\nAs if to prove that big studio films could still compete in an expanding marketplace, in 2006 mainline studio Universal Pictures released Inside Man from director Spike Lee, which earned the seminal director his first 100 million dollar grossing film.\n\nTHE AFRICAN AMERICAN FILM CRITICS ASSOCIATION\n\nIn 2003, a group of African American film critics launched the African American Film Critic’s Association (AAFCA), the first organization of its kind in the film industry. Much like the Foreign Press Association and the New York and Los Angeles Film Critics, the AAFCA platform creates awareness for films produced, written, directed and starring talent of African descent. Like the other groups, AAFCA issues an annual Top 10 List comprised of films release during a calendar year. Since its inception, the nationwide body has attracted a cross section of prominent entertainment media who represent print, TV, radio and online.\n\nBRITISH INVASION\n\nMuch like their Anglo counterparts, British actors of African descent have also performed well in the film industry. Sine the mid-1990’s British actors of African descent have been making inroads in American films. In 1996 British actress Marianne Jean Baptist earned an Oscar nomination for her role in Secrets & Lies. The influx of Afro-British talent to the film industry has continued into the new millennium with the arrival of actors like Idris Elba (The Gospel, Daddy’s Little Girl), Thandie Newton (Mission Impossible 2, The Pursuit of Happyness), Eamonn Walker (Tears of the Sun) and Chiwetel Ejofor (Kinky Boots, Inside Man).\n\nHOME ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS\n\nThe growing acceptance of DVD and other Home Entertainment options have provided blacks in film with additional growth opportunities in the new millennium. With an increasing market share, Home Entertainment properties have not only substantially increased employment options for blacks in films, but also provide increased platforms for African American themed entertainment properties. Every studio in the film industry now has Home Entertainment divisions that produce and acquires content for the Home Entertainment market. However, the leader in terms of providing African American content is Codeblack Entertainment.\n\nEstablished in June 2005, by industry veteran Jeffrey Clanagan, Codeblack has made in-roads in the development of African American themed content. With more than 30 titles currently on the market, the company recently entered into full-scale film production to further advance African American themes and talent in films.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICANS IN TELEVISION\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS OF TELEVISION\n\nLargely due to the fact that many of the new medium’s early stars were lifted from popular radio programs, African American performers began to make advancements within television almost from the start. For example, entertainer and pianist Bob Howard was included in the CBS network’s evening broadcast. Another gifted entertainer, jazz pianist Hazel Scott, had her own 15-minute broadcast three days a week. African American performers also appeared on variety and game shows, such as Your Show of Shows, All Star Revue, Strike it Rich, and High Finance, throughout the late 1940s and into the 1950s. On the ABC television network, musician Billy Daniels was given his own short-lived variety show in the fall of 1952.\n\nAlthough television did not make use of all the same stereotypes that cinema employed, many negative caricatures did arise. As the medium began to rebroadcast feature films and shorts that appeared in theaters, many grossly unflattering portrayals of African Americans began to appear on television. In fact, such shorts as Hal Roach’s Our Gang/Little Rascals became television mainstays.\n\nIn 1950, veteran actress Ethel Waters appeared on the first television show in which an African American was the central figure. As the star of Beulah for the first two seasons, the popular show centered on the weekly trials and tribulations of a black maid or “mammy”—a supporting character on the popular Fibber McGee and Molly radio show. (Beulah ran until 1953, when protests by the NAACP and other activist groups forced its cancellation.)\n\nOther numerous former radio performers quickly followed in Waters’s wake including Eddie “Rochester” Anderson who played opposite Jack Benny on The Jack Benny Show and Willie Best who was a regularly featured performer on The Trouble with Father and Oh My Little Margie. In 1953 actress Lillian Randolph began to reprise the role of a maid that she played on radio for the television series Make Room for Daddy. Later, she appeared in the television show Great Gildersleeve.\n\nPerhaps no other television show, though, created as much controversy for its negative stereotyping of African Americans as the Amos n’ Andy show. Based on the very popular 1930s and 1940s radio show Amos n’ Andy ran from 1951 to 1953. The show was perceived by many, both black and white, as an offensive reminder of the past, and the NAACP initiated lawsuits and boycott threats that were critical in forcing the show’s cancellation. After the series was cancelled though, it continued to appear in syndication until the mid-1960s.\n\nThoughout the early 1950s, variety shows hosted by veteran white entertainers, such as Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, and Steve Allen, occasionally featured African American entertainers. But in 1956, NBC took the bold step of creating a slot for the variety program The Nat King Cole Show. Although the variety format had always been very popular with television viewers, and Cole’s recording success was undeniable, the network was unable to secure regular sponsors, especially after Cole touched the arm of a white female guest. The show was cancelled after its first season.\n\nCOMMERCIAL TELEVISION REACTS TO THE 1960S\n\nThroughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, African Americans appeared in many serious documentaries concerning rural poverty, segregation, and the Civil Rights movement led by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The powerful medium of television provided King and the other leaders the opportunity to increase the white viewing audience’s awareness of their civil rights cause.\n\nCommercial television reacted to the changing political, social, and economic climate in the United States much the same way that cinema did—by including more African American performers in its programming. Ensemble television shows soon began to feature African American performers: Otis Young appeared in The Outcast; Greg Morris starred in Mission Impossible; and Nichelle Nichols was featured in Star Trek. However, the most dramatic changes in television’s positioning of African American talent occurred when Sheldon Leonard hired Bill Cosby as one of two leads to star in the 1965 television show I Spy and actress Diahann Carroll was featured as a widowed nurse and single mother in the drama Julia.\n\nWhile the show only lasted three seasons, I Spy marked the first time that an African American television actor was so widely accepted by television viewers—primarily for his inoffensive, perfect image. Consequently, Cosby earned three Emmy Awards for his portrayal of the character, Alexander Scott. Lasting from 1968 to 1971, Julia presented Carroll as an African American woman seemingly detached from the reality of the lives led by most African Americans. Though popular with the majority viewing audience, the show was criticized for its bland depiction of an African American. Others, however, viewed Carroll’s character as an improvement over past characterizations of African Americans on television.\n\nBlacks also began to appear on television in roles opposite whites in ways that had never before been possible. Harlem Detective featured black and white actors cast as equals on the police force. Eastside/Westside and The Nurses featured African American actresses Cicely Tyson and Hilda Simms, respectively, in regularly featured roles. Praised for its more balanced portrayal of African Americans, Eastside/Westside unfortunately lasted only one season.\n\nAs the first successful African American television variety show, The Flip Wilson Show was the first weekly program by an African American to feature “racial comedy” as\n\na form of general audience entertainment. The show’s rousing success paved the way for the development of the future African American situation comedies.\n\nTHE PRESENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ON TELEVISION EXPANDS\n\nDuring the 1970s television producers, such as Norman Lear with All in the Family, Sanford and Son, and Good Times and Bud Yorkin with What’s Happenin’ and Carter Country, created comedy programming to appeal to African American audiences. Though these shows flourished and made the African American presence on television commonplace, critics referred to them as “new minstrelsy” and derided their perpetuation of stereotypical aspects of African American humor.\n\nOne of the most significant changes occurred in children’s television programming. The public television series Sesame Street featured a multiracial mix of children and adults interacting and learning. In addition, animated programs or cartoons, such as Bill Cosby’s Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (1972–1989) and the Jackson Five, depicted events in the lives of young African American characters.\n\nIn the category of drama, notably made-for-television movies and miniseries, two productions stood out among the rest in the 1970s—The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1974) and Roots (1977). Starring actress Cicely Tyson, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman was set in 1962 and spanned the life of a 110-year old African American woman from the era of slavery to the 1960s Civil Rights movement. For her outstanding efforts, Tyson was awarded an Emmy for best lead actress in a drama-special program. Based on the Alex Haley novel, Roots was the highest-rated miniseries ever, attracting an estimated 130 million viewers. Featuring such prominent African American actors as Louis Gossett Jr., Cicely Tyson, and Maya Angelou, the eight-part epic movie traced Haley’s family history from Africa to slavery in the American South.\n\nTHE COSBY DECADE\n\nThroughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, African American actors continued to appear in stereotypical comedies or made-for-television movies with few exceptions. In 1984, however, veteran entertainer Bill Cosby returned to television with a half-hour series called The Cosby Show. Although expected to do well, few could have predicted the level of the show’s popularity. Consistently rated the top weekly television program, The Cosby Show ran for eight seasons and created tremendous opportunities for African American performers. While the phenomenal success of the Roots miniseries had proven that all-African American television vehicles could attract a large viewing audience, The Cosby Show demonstrated that an audience of similar proportions would also regularly support an entertaining, family-oriented program centered on African Americans as well.\n\nIn the wake of The Cosby Show’s success, an increasing number of African Americans began producing more African American-themed shows in the late 1980s. Actor Frank Reid produced and starred in the short-lived, Emmy Award-winning show Frank’s Place. Choreographer Debbie Allen produced The Cosby Show spin-off A Different World, which depicted academic life at a historical African American university. In addition, Quincy Jones produced The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air starring rap artist Will Smith, and In Living Color, which was produced by comedian Keenan Ivory Wayans and featured many talented members of the Wayans family.\n\nBURGEONING TELEVISION NETWORKS TARGET AFRICAN AMERICAN AUDIENCES\n\nBlack Entertainment Television (BET) Holdings, Inc., which began operations in the 1980s, became the first African American-controlled cable entertainment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1990s. Led by industry giant Robert Johnson, BET targets an estimated 45 million subscribers nationwide by providing original programming on its three cable television channels—BET Cable Network, BET on Jazz, and BET Movies/Starz!3. In addition, the company has diversified its holdings by publishing magazines, marketing clothes and cosmetics, and forming a partnership with Microsoft to offer MSBET, an online service that provides entertainment information to the growing number of African Americans using the Internet. Citing a need to expand market share, as well as improve ad revenue, Robert Johnson sold the pioneering network to Viacom Holdings in November 2000. Although this move was not expected to affect programming, it did mark the end of African American ownership of any major TV concern.\n\nWhile African American programs have become an increasing rarity on the major television networks which have begun to concentrate on offerings that deliver them the widest possible audience share, the launch of several networks brought new promise for African Americans. Clearly understanding the financial gain that could result, such upstart television networks as Fox, Warner Brothers (WB), and United Paramount Network (UPN) began to vigorously court African American audiences in the 1990s. Such highly-rated programs as Roc, Living Single, Martin, as well as many others were major hits with both black and young white television viewers.\n\nFinally, in the areas of daytime and late night talk shows, several African Americans attained widespread acceptance for the first time in television history: Oprah Winfrey and Montel Williams have produced Emmy Award-winning daytime shows, while Arsenio Hall successfully led many imitators in attempting to revitalize the late night talk show format.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN TELEVISION\n\nAs the television industry headed into the twenty-first century, more African Americans than ever before were involved in television—in acting, production, and executive roles. However, while African Americans have continued to enjoy success in comedic television vehicles, no primetime dramatic series has made it beyond a full television season since the 1970s. Instead, the trend is for African American performers to be cast in ensemble shows, such as ER, Touched by an Angel, and NYPD Blue. Although most of these shows integrate their African American cast members into their stories well, many African American performers fear that their singular voice is being diluted by an increasingly multiethnic array of characters.\n\nThis brand of programming has received mixed reviews from the NAACP and other minority watchdog groups, who in recent years have challenged the networks on the lack of diversity in their programming. In an attempt to counter such fallout, during the 2001 TV season network programmers introduced two new sitcoms (My Wife and Kids and The Bernie Mac Show) which enjoyed solid ratings and whose success could even spark another “Black Renaissance” on TV.\n\nOn the other hand, the monopolies once held by the major networks have in recent years been overrun by the growing cable market, which has increased opportunities for Black talent. Cable programming has countered traditional TV programming with a brand of engaging and often provocative shows that have attracted viewers away from the major networks, as seen by the success of regularly scheduled shows like OZ, Soul Food and The Shield, and made-for-TV films like Feast of All Saints, Boycott, and The Corner. Although the sale of BET in November 2000, left a void in terms of black ownership within this market, the cable market does appear to be offering African American talent great growth opportunities as we settle into the new millenium.\n\nLaunched amidst great fanfare in January of 1995, the creation of the UPN and WB networks brought new promise for African Americans in Television. Both networks’ early programming delivered alternative viewing options to traditional television fare. With a line-up of shows that stressed diversity and leaned heavily on urban themed programming like Moesha, The Wayans Brothers, For Your Love, and The Steve Harvey Show, both networks were soon well established in the marketplace. Ironically, just as their reputations became established, both networks began to abandon their urban programming initiatives in favor of more “mainstream” fare. Although the UPN has continued to maintain a night dedicated to urban comedies, the network has consistently come under fire from watchdog groups for the stereotypical content being portrayed.\n\nCHANGING FACES IN TELEVISION\n\nTelevision in the new millennium presented expanded options for African Americans. The growing popularity of cable television created a demand for niche market programming that introduced alternative viewing choices for African Americans audiences. Although the largest share of this market is controlled by BET (which in 2001 was acquired by media giant Viacom), two additional channels (the Black Family Channel in 1999 and TV One in 2004) were launched, which increased competition and variety in the opportunity for African American in television.\n\nAnother major development in the new millennium was the merger of the WB and UPN networks into the CW channel. Although this move resulted in the cancellation of a number of African American themed shows, it also represented expanded viewership for other African American themed series like the Tyra Banks Show and TV producer Mara Brock-Akil’s hit shows Girlfriends and The Game.\n\nSHIFTING TRENDS IN THE TV MARKET\n\nThe most influential genre to hit the TV market in the new millennium has been the advent of “reality programming”. Although originally used to describe that feature ordinary (non-actors) people in unscripted dramatic or humorous shows, these shows have gained popularity since 2000 because of there ability to place ordinary people in extraordinary situations. Reality shows have been very fruitful for African Americans, who on shows like The Apprentice and American Idol have resulted in “real life” career breaks for reality TV performers like Omarosa and 2006 Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson.\n\nThe reality genre helped to spawn a new career for former supermodel Tyra Banks, who debut her reality show America’s Next Top Model, in 2003 and her self titled talk show in 2005. Other notable African American entries in reality programming include BET’s highly-rated College Hill that features life on historical black college campuses.\n\nAnother popular TV genre experiencing a comeback in the new millennium is ensemble television. This genre was a TV mainstay through the first decades of the medium when shows Bonanza, The Walton and Hill Street Blues ruled the airwaves. As television viewers’ habits shifted in the late 80s and 90s ensemble TV took a backseat to comedies and other formats, before coming back with a vengeance at the beginning of the new millennium with fresh crop of ensemble shows. This group includes several notable shows featuring African American talent and themes like Oz, The Wire and Lincoln Heights, which as of 2007, is the only African American family drama on the air. The multiple Emmy-winning ensemble drama Grey’s Anatomy created and produced by Shondra Rhimes also deserves honorable mention.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nTelevision is an evolving medium that will continue to grow and expand. As new technologies emerge and market tastes shift, TV will keep pace and remain at the forefront of new innovations. As for the African American presence in the medium, viewers can expect established names to continue popping up on screen and new players to step in the game who will maintain the powerful and resilient standards set forth by their predecessors.\n\nFILMOGRAPHY OF SELECTED FEATURE FILMS AND DOCUMENTARIES\n\nThe following filmography includes more than 200 selected feature films and documentaries that are remarkable for their depiction of themes and issues related to the experiences of African Americans throughout history. Ranging from the early silent movie era through major studio releases, documentaries, and made-for-television movies of the 1990s, many of these cinematic works also represent significant milestones for African Americans in the film and television industries.\n\n8 MILE (2002)\n\nThe semi-autobiographical film chronicles the early life of blue-eye rapper Eminem.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICANS IN WWII: A LEGACY OF PATRIOTISM AND VALOR (2000)\n\nAfrican American war veterans from all branches of the military describe their personal experiences in World War II.
