Filming will take place in Cleveland Heights over the next month for a Paramount Pictures movie called "Fun Size," according to Susanna Niermann O’Neil, Cleveland Heights assistant city manager.

Set for release in 2012, "Fun Size" is about “a sarcastic teenage girl who is forced to take her little brother trick-or-treating on Halloween, then loses him and must find him before their mother finds out,” according to a press release from the Greater Cleveland Film Commission. Nickelodeon's Victoria Justice will star in the film, directed by Josh Schwartz, producer of "The O.C.", "Gossip Girl" and "Chuck".

Two nights of shooting will take place in Coventry Village, Niermann O’Neil said. The exact schedule keeps changing, but as of now the street will be closed to cars and pedestrians starting at 9 p.m., July 5 and 6, she said.

Coventry businesses will not be too negatively impacted because Tuesdays and Wednesdays are their slow nights, Niermann O’Neil said. The filmmakers have said that names in the storefronts will remain in the movie.

Two residential streets will also be decorated and closed for all-night filming, but the studio and city are not releasing the specific locations out of security concerns for the stars, Niermann O’Neil said.

It was Paramount’s responsibility to contact, and get approval from, all the residents of the neighborhoods where they are filming, she said.

Additional filming will take place in other locations in and around Cleveland, but Cleveland Heights was chosen for these scenes because they loved our neighborhoods and liked the feel of the city, said Niermann O’Neil.

All extras have already been cast, Niermann O'Neil said. “People should not think they can get in the movie.”

Despite rumors that a second movie, "I, Alex Cross," will also be shot in Cleveland Heights this summer, Niermann O'Neil said nobody from that production has contacted the city.
