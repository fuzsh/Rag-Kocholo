The Victoria Cross was created on 29 January 1856 and recognises acts of extreme bravery carried out under direct enemy fire.

It was the first bravery medal that could be earned by anyone in the Army or the Navy and the act which earns the award must be witnessed by several individuals. The Victoria Cross was named after Queen Victoria, who personally chose the inscription, 'For Valour'. The design shows a lion guarding the Royal Crown, emphasising the personal link between the British monarch and recipients of the VC.

The Victoria Cross was handmade, traditionally using bronze taken from a gun captured in the Crimean War and has been awarded to over 1,300 people since its creation. It was deliberately intended to have little actual value â€“ its value lies in what it stands for and what people do to earn it
