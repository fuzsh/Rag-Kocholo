        "text": "The Royal Hotel starts out like a survival horror movie typically would, but director Kitty Green isn't here to fulfil audiences' expectations.\n\nHere's the setting: two young women travel to a remote, isolated area of the Australian Outback to work as barmaids in a male-dominated local pub, where the drunk owner tends to disappear and handsy customers go unchecked.\n\nTensions escalate as the story unfolds, but extreme violence was never an option for the filmmaker. After all, what is scarier than letting the viewers' imagination run wild?\n\n\"The [horror-movie] tropes are all there, but we challenge it by making it a movie about women,\" Green explains in an interview with Digital Spy, ahead of its release on November 3.\n\nIn a Halloween-themed week where many viewers are looking for the best horror movies to watch, The Royal Hotel might be the scariest, most original alternative to turn to.\n\nThe Australian director is no stranger to creating oppressive patriarchal worlds where women fight for their survival.\n\nIn The Assistant, her first fiction feature after directing documentaries like Netflix's Casting JonBenét, Green offered a harrowing portrayal of toxic office culture that became an essential movie in the #MeToo era in Hollywood.\n\nNow, she teams up again with Ozark's Julia Garner in the critically-acclaimed The Royal Hotel, which is based on a real story captured in the 2016 documentary Hotel Coolgardie.\n\nWhile exploring the effects of \"alcohol-fuelled aggression\" in a suffocating environment, Kitty Green decided once again to \"show people what it's like to be a woman in the world\".\n\nAnd sometimes that can be scarier than any horror movie.\n\nWhat captivated you about Hotel Coolgardie to turn it into a fictional film?\n\nThere's something interesting in the documentary. It's about two Scandinavian women working in a bar, and I thought it was interesting the fact that, culturally, they didn't understand the Australian behaviour. They often said no and spoke up when they weren't comfortable, and I think that was very interesting because I think us Australians often put up with a lot of that behaviour. And kind of let it go and not say much about it. And here's these two girls who were saying: you can't say that to me. I thought that was an interesting diving point for a script: how can we look at two women sort of finding themselves, figuring out their own limits and their own strengths, in a film like this?\n\nWhat changes were important to you in this translation from documentary to fiction?\n\nThe documentary has a very bleak ending. When we were adapting it, we were thinking: how can we make this film about strength? How do we make sure that women win in the end? That was really important. And that they take a stand to what they see as bad behaviour. So that was the biggest change. But also, there's not a single line of dialogue that comes from the documentary, it's all pretty fresh and new.\n\nHave your own life and travelling experiences influenced the script?\n\nYes! I've done a lot of backpacking in my 20s, I've been everywhere in the middle of the night, strange stations and clubs around the world, I did my share of all that and it probably informed it, but also just spending time in pubs, watching how people deal with unruly bar patrons and custumers. The movie is about that kind of late-night, alcohol-fuelled aggression that can happen anywhere. You can see it in London, and you can definitely see it in the Outback, where it's probably amplified by how remote and isolated it is.\n\nOn paper, The Royal Hotel may sound like a classic survival horror movie. Were you ever tempted to go down that route or that was that something you wanted to avoid?\n\nIt definitely sets up like a horror movie, the tropes and the conventions of the genre are all there, but we challenge it by making it a movie about women.\n\nDid that challenge include avoiding portrayals of violence and sexual assault, which sometimes are a given in this kind of thriller?\n\nDefinitely. I've seen too much sexual violence on screen, I have no desire to show that or film that or have an actor go through that. Let's talk instead about the type of behaviour that, if you let it escalate, would become something like that. How do we stop it before it gets there, how do we say no and stand up for ourselves before it ever becomes that violent or that awful? Still, people find the movie very terrifying, even if it never crosses that line.\n\nWere you ever questioned about this decision?\n\nOh yeah, people want more violence. They definitely want more to happen. When we were trying to finance it, that was a lot of the criticism we got from the script — nothing happens. And we had to explain that was what we were trying to do, that there's a lot going on even if it's not the violence that you want to see. Which is bizarre the fact they want that, it's problematic. We did come up against a lot of that criticism, but I think the movie speaks for itself, so I'm proud of it.\n\nYou didn't cross the line in The Assistant either.\n\nBecause what really interests me, and makes me want to make a movie, is looking at aspects of our culture that often I noticed but other people don't. By making a film and using close-ups and different sort of techniques, I am able to highlight or amplify these moments, and show people what it's like to be a woman in the world. How it's like to be a woman in a film company who is not treated fairly, or a woman in a bar who feels threatened.\n\nWe were curious about one detail: the dead snakes that are kept in jars behind the bar in the movie. Is there a hidden meaning there?\n\nWell, there are a lot of ways to look at it. It's something we saw in a lot of bars while we were travelling around, often kept behind the bar in a glass, but it was also interesting in relation to the main character. She has this snake-like instinct, snakes have to always examine their environments for threats, and that's what she's doing in this role.\n\nOscar [Redding], who wrote the film with me, had another idea about the caged snakes and how it symbolises freedom when they are released in the end. And also a lot of people think about these dangerous animals when picturing Australia, so it was good to include them.\n\nWas the ending we see in the movie the one you always wanted?\n\nYes. The documentary was really bleak, and we went into it like: how can these girls stand up for themselves in the end? Some people will be happy with that, some other people might think they've gone too far, but we are really proud of it. We wanted them to take a stand. We wanted them to say no to everything they've put up with throughout the movie.\n\nIs empowering female viewers something you're after with your work?\n\nI don't know if it's empowering, but I do think people like to see their fears reflected. I think that's a great thing that people relate to and can feel seen by. Both this film and The Assistant had that. Basically it takes three years to make a movie, so you hope that, if you're going to spend that much time on something, that you have a message that matters and that resonates with people. I hope to inspire, to empower, in any way I can, but I'm not thinking about that going into the projects.\n\nI'm just here making my weird little movies!"
