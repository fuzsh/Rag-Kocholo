        "text": "Good subject as does appear these type of stories not being picked up as movie subjects.\n\nOne reason could be that the actual incident for which medal awarded might not be enough to sustain a movie script. If you were an Australian producer looking to make a Vietnam movie you would probably pick Long Tan over say Keith Paynes VC action. Has to be more to the story.\n\nHard to think of any specific movies apart from Yorke and Murphy as mentioned.\n\nZulu Dawn does show Coghill and Melville in the saving the colours incident. They were actually the first VC's to be awarded posthumously and that was 30 years after Ishandlwana.\n\nGoing back to the script side of things. For example there have been some MOH's awarded for Afghanistan but would they make good movie subjects. Not saying they would not. I did note Bradley Cooper and Spielberg were going to make a movie based on a sniper who was later shot at firing range by another veteran. Unfortunately may no longer be going ahead. The Pat Tillman story would be a good movie but there is already a very good documentary about him.\n\nWhilst not particularly related to MoH a good movie subject would be about the Kentucky National Guard actions during an ambush in Iraq on 20 March 2005. The squad known as Raven 42 earned a Distinguished Service Cross, 2 Silver Stars, 3 Bronze Stars. One of the Silver Stars was to a woman who was first to receive that medal. The 8 men and 2 women were reservists from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAnother good movie subject would be COL David Hackworth who did not get a MOH but got the most impressive medal collection of any US soldier. His story covers his exploits as a Sgt in Korea to battalion commander in Vietnam. Also we'll known for his criticism of how the war was being run. Has an Aussie connection as lived on Sunshine Coast. See www.hackworth.com\n\nSome of the British Generals in the 1800's earned VC's and went on to have interesting careers but simply not going to happen as a movie.\n\nNZ could do one on double VC winner Charles Upham. Perhaps after Peter Jackson done The Dambusters!\n\nBrett"
