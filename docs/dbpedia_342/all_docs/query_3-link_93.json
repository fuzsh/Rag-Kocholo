        "text": "Movies aren’t just a means of escapism and entertainment. While, yes, many theater experiences enrapture us away from reality and transport us beyond ourselves to another world entirely, sometimes they may also hold up a looking glass to our own lives. Whether set in outer space or right around your knack of the woods, films have a great deal to teach us about common themes of everyday life, such as friendship.\n\nUpdate July 16, 2023: This article has been updated to include even more great movies about friendship, including a recently released film.\n\nFriendship is a dynamic often explored in film and in a great number of ways. We see the tales of friends that drift apart, of friends that become lovers, of betrayal, of loyalty, and of finding friendship in the least of expected places. No matter what genre, and even if the characters are not even human, the stories told in film are rooted in the human experience and, therefore, can almost always inspire thoughtful reflection. From moving indie pieces and high-stakes dramas to blockbuster comedies, here are twenty films that can teach us a great deal about friendship.\n\n25 Joy Ride (2023)\n\nThe newest entry to this list, Joy Ride, is very much in The Hangover mold, a wacky raunchy comedy as friends travel to a new location and get into trouble. Yet what makes Joy Ride so incredibly enjoyable is the real heart underneath it, particularly as it pertains to friendship. The main character Audrey (Ashley Park), has two very different friends, the famous actress Kat (Stephanie Hsu) and her longtime childhood best friend Lolo (Sherry Cola), and are joined on a trip to China by Lolo's cousin Deadeye (Sabrina Wu).\n\nThese four characters all have varying degrees of familiarity with one another, but over the course of the film grow close to one another and form strong bonds. The film even ends with the promise that these characters will remain friends for the rest of their lives.\n\n24 Thelma & Louise (1991)\n\nAnother delightful movie about two very astonishing and fierce women, Thelma & Louise, follows the titular ladies as they embark on an adventure of a lifetime. Thelma is a sincere housewife, and Louise is a waitress. They live their small lives in their small town until one day they decide to go on a weekend getaway. But their simple road trip turns into a high-flying escape from their ordinary lives when Louise ends up shooting a would-be rapist and becoming outlaws within the night.\n\nThe two women hit the road in a classic 1966 Thunderbird convertible with no money, a gun under the seat, and the law hot on their heels. Directed by Ridley Scott, the movie is a blazing ride. There’s everything that makes it memorable – humor, sly wisdom, and deep feelings. But at its core, it shows us that friendship can endure even the most challenging situations.\n\n23 Dead Poets Society (1989)\n\nUnder Peter Weir’s careful direction, this achingly beautiful story comes to life only to leave an indelible mark on our soul – much like lifelong friends do. Set at the strict and staid Welton Academy boarding school in 1959, Dead Poets Society begins when the free-spirited, highly intellectual, yet unconventional John Keating is hired to teach an English class to boys filled with a longing to escape their dull lives and strict parents.\n\nThrough clever poetry lessons, subversive teaching methods, and vivid gestures, Keating inspires the boys – who eventually end up discovering the secret club and call themselves the Dead Poets Society – to break the rules and seize the day. From Neil’s story of breaking out of the confines of his parents’ expectations to Todd’s journey of finally finding the strength to fit in, the film is a moving testament to how important certain people can be in our lives.\n\n22 Stand By Me (1986)\n\nStand By Me is an amusing tale of boyhood and the wonder associated with the age. It follows four misfit boys who plunge headfirst into an epic journey during the summer of 1959. When a neighborhood kid reveals that he saw the body of a missing boy, these kids are immediately intrigued, and they set out on a perilous 48-hour quest across rural Oregon's woodland to see the corpse for themselves. Because let’s admit it, tender young hearts are unafraid of and curious about literally everything.\n\nRelated: 9 Wholesome Movies About Friendship for All Age Groups\n\nOn their misadventures, the boys reveal deeper truths, and the final realization that occurs is this. Growing up does not mean leaving your childhood behind. While this is a lesson we all need, Rob Reiner’s coming-of-age story teaches it to us through a friendship that never fails.\n\n21 The Intouchables (2011)\n\nAn innovative but superb study in friendship and the healing power that comes with the presence of another human, The Intouchables is a true story that centers around two people from very different lives. Philippe is a brilliant yet arrogant Parisian aristocrat quadriplegic who hires Driss, a street-smart, unemployed stranger, to be his caregiver. The men develop an incredible friendship that helps them both become better versions of themselves.\n\nThey realize they have more in common than they could have ever imagined. Philippe brings out the joy of living that Driss seems to lack and Driss helps repair a life that has shattered under the weight of seclusion. Their witty banter turns into a roaring laughter and they go on random road trips. Eventually, two souls separated by race, wealth, culture, and generation begin to understand each other in this feel-good movie.\n\n20 The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)\n\nThe wonder of The Banshees of Inisherin is the palpable humanity of the story being told. Though the film is set on an entirely fictional Irish isle of Inisherin, the heart of the story feels devastatingly true. It is not lost on the audience that the self-destructive feud between long-time friends Colm and Pádraic is set in the aftermath of the Irish Civil War. The two friends fight each other, but truly themselves, just as their country did the same.\n\nPerhaps the erratic behavior of the men is a reflection of the sort of damage that wartime does to the human psyche, but even without the metaphors for war, the film speaks to the erratic and passionate nature that emotions and relationships can have. Colm is tired of his friend Pádraic rather out of the blue, and each man digs in his heels to either end the friendship or attempt to mend it, respectively. The characters make some extreme decisions in the film that (hopefully) do not mirror real life for most people, but it can invite us to reflect on the moments where pride and obstinacy can lead us to futile battles.\n\n19 Booksmart (2019)\n\nBooksmart is a witty coming-of-age comedy that emphasizes the importance of independence within a healthy friendship. Molly and Amy, two high school seniors and soon-to-be-graduates, are enjoying a night of partying before their upcoming graduation. This isn’t a very typical night for the pair, who have been mostly unpopular throughout their high school career.\n\nThey decide to make this night a memorable one as they regretfully reflect on their high school experiences, but this, of course, does not go according to plan. As the girls weave in and out of one chaotic situation and another, nearly tearing their friendship apart, they come to terms with themselves and set healthy boundaries for their friendship.\n\n18 Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (2015)\n\nThis moving film captures its premise, very much in a nutshell, in the title. Introverted high school student Greg is forced to re-assume a friendship with a former childhood companion, the now terminally-ill Rachel. Along with his friend and film-making buddy Earl, Greg grows increasingly fond of Rachel as she battles her diagnosis. Friendship with a terminally-ill person is not easy for Greg, and he has to learn how to step outside himself and think selflessly when it comes to Rachel.\n\nHe wants her to keep fighting the cancer, but ultimately learns how to respect her choices and continue to be a good friend in the way that she needs him to be, not according to his own selfish desires. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is furthermore a powerful and touching piece for anyone who has suffered the loss of a friend or loved one.\n\n17 Girls Trip (2017)\n\nEven a light-hearted and sometimes raunchy comedy can teach us a lot about friendship. Girls Trip takes its leading ladies on a New Orleans getaway on account of one of them speaking at the Essence Music Festival. Though their friendship has survived since their college days, the women all live vastly different lifestyles.\n\nThe film highlights how long-distance friendships can often bypass the growing pains that relationships face as people evolve, and their lives dramatically change, with the reunion bringing these issues to the surface. The women can either let these challenges tear their group apart, or they can take advantage of this time together to not only get to know each other again as they are and not as they were, but to reconnect with long-lost parts of themselves.\n\n16 Wonder (2017)\n\nThis true tear-jerker follows little August “Auggie” Pullman, a boy living with a rare genetic disorder called Treacher Collins Syndrome. The disorder causes developmental deformities in children, which may sometimes lead to increased complications. As one may expect, enrolling in a public school for fifth grade after having been homeschooled proves a difficult endeavor for Auggie, who is initially rejected by his classmates.\n\nEnduring some bullying and struggling to find true friendships, Auggie continues to be positive and kind, with the school community eventually coming around for the young boy. Wonder speaks to the power of kindness and friendship, encouraging viewers to look beyond appearances and to appreciate people for who they are.\n\n15 Frances Ha (2013)\n\nWritten by Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, as well as directed by the former and starring the latter, Frances Ha is a unique indie film about being in your twenties. With its black-and-white film style, the dramedy follows the titular character of Frances (Gerwig) as she faces a sort of quarter-life crisis. Her roommate and best friend Sophie seems to be moving onto bigger and better things, with every update taking her to greater heights. First, she announces she is moving into a desirable neighborhood. Then, she is taken with a man who she eventually follows to Tokyo, with the pair later becoming engaged.\n\nThis all serves as a stark contrast to Frances, whose friendship with Sophie becomes increasingly distant as she faces stagnation in her own career and romantic life. Frances learns a valuable lesson about the importance of friendship, not comparing oneself to others, and of finding happiness in the little victories of life as she reflects and grows. The shining star of Frances Ha is the story of friendship between Frances and Sophie, showing how friendship is not always all rosy, especially as young people come into themselves and transition through life’s eras.\n\n14 The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nA group of adolescent girls are going their separate ways, but they all love that one pair of jeans that fits them all just right. A symbol of their enduring bond, the girls decide to send the pants around all summer so that each can put some use to them. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants follows the girls as the jeans make their rounds around the world and the girls learn valuable life lessons.\n\n13 Mean Girls (2004)\n\nThis classic teen comedy is likely known to most readers, but it is worth a revisit to explore the lessons it can teach us. Mean Girls produced some of the most iconic moments in early 2000s comedy, with its characters and sequences endlessly parodied to this day. As Cady Heron loses herself in envy and frivolity in her duplicitous scheme to sabotage the “plastics”, she loses sight of her own values as a person. In fact, nearly all the characters in the movie lose themselves to some sort of social vice, be it gossip, envy, hatred, manipulation, or selfishness.\n\nThe film does a marvelous job of calling out this behavior without punishing the characters. The students of Northshore High School get to confront the worst parts of themselves and subsequently improve their lives and friendships, growing through exploring the best and worst of themselves.\n\n12 E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nThis comforting children’s sci-fi film follows the funny-looking but lovable little extra-terrestrial, known as E.T., as he seeks shelter – and finds friendship among– the children of the Taylor household. E.T. is possibly the most endearing alien in any Hollywood film, with his presence being entirely harmless as he demonstrates various powers. The story is a friendship that transcends our very planet, as young Elliot forms a deep connection with E.T. A classic of the 1980s, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a heart-warming lesson on the purity of friendship, kindness, and devotion.\n\n11 Big Hero 6 (2014)\n\nThe animated superhero film follows young Hiro, a genius boy living in the fictional and futuristic city of San Fransokyo. He follows his brother into a world of science and robotics, which quickly turns dark with the rise of a rogue scientist and the death of Hiro’s brother, Tadashi. The story follows the main character’s journey through grief, as he first neglects friendship in a blind pursuit of vengeance. He eventually learns the power of healing through friendship, and bonds with the well-meaning Baymax. Despite being a children’s film, Big Hero 6 has powerful storylines and meaningful lessons in its epic animated sequences.\n\n10 The Breakfast Club (1985)\n\nAnother teen classic, The Breakfast Club is a coming-of-age story with a valuable lesson on friendship. The group of teens at its center come together for a shared punishment of all-day detention. Despite their differences, the group forms lasting friendships and touching bonds as they get to know each other. Besides being one of the most iconic movies of the 1980s, The Breakfast Club is a timeless exploration of the teenage psyche, and the importance that genuine and supportive friendships have on young people.\n\n9 Bridesmaids (2011)\n\nThe blockbuster comedy tackles friendship in one of the most stressful but rewarding of events— a wedding. As a group of women comes together as bridesmaids, they fall into a series of hijinx that lead them on journeys of self-discovery and strengthened bonds. Bridesmaids, along with previous entries Girls Trip and Joy Ride, show there really is something special about female friendships.\n\n8 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n\nLorelai Lee and Dorothy Shaw are a pair of best friends with a common gift– seducing men. Of course, the pair have different ideas of what they look for in a man and as a result, different methods of captivating their suitors. The two women are unapologetically looking out for themselves and each other, having the sort of fun in their youth that beautiful young women vying for marriage can have. They don’t take these men too seriously, and their friendship remains of paramount priority. In the end, the two women find what they were looking for without sacrificing themselves or their loyalty to each other.\n\n7 Cinema Paradiso (1988)\n\nWinning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Cinema Paradiso is a beautiful tale of a young boy, Salvatore, in the small Sicilian village of Giancaldo as he discovers the magic of cinema. The story is told via flashbacks from the perspective of a now-grown Salvatore who works as a film marker in Rome. Salvatore receives news of the death of Alfredo, the man who taught him how to operate the projections at the local cinema, prompting him to return to Giancaldo for the funeral. The film is nothing short of a masterpiece as young Salvatore’s journey of discovery and coming of age journey is captured with the enchantment and wonder of a child. The friendship at the center of the film, that of Alfredo and Salvatore, shows us that lifelong bonds and the most meaningful of connections can be found and maintained in unlikely places, transcending age and distance.\n\nRelated: 15 Heartwarming Movies Where Two Best Friends Fall in Love\n\nDespite their estrangement, Alfredo never forgot the boy he became a sort of father figure for, following Salvatore’s success from afar. Salvatore did not stay in contact with the old man as well as he should have through the years, but perhaps that is the truest sign of the familial nature of the relationship— sometimes we take for granted those who have the greatest investment in our happiness and well-being. Perhaps the truest sign of being loved unconditionally and fully is the folly of taking the connection for granted, because we are too comfortable and secure in it to give thought to its absence. Alfredo understands this, and he leaves a gift for the boy that puts him back in touch with his roots.\n\n6 The Outsiders (1983)"
