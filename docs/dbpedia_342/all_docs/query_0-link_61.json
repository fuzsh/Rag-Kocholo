        "text": "The Bridge on the River Kwai was a commercial and critical hit that tells the story of a group of Allied prisoners of war forced to work on a railway bridge in Thailand to connect Bangkok with Rangoon during WWII. Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) initially resists efforts to compel the officers to work, but ultimately decides to build the bridge properly as a matter of honor and a testament to British ingenuity.\n\nThe Burma Railway, also known as the “railway of death,” was an actual infrastructure project undertaken by the Japanese during WWII. The construction used forced labor from local civilians and Allied prisoners subjected to appalling conditions. The workers' treatment was far worse than shown in the film. The British War Office was far from pleased with the portrayal of Allied prisoners of war willingly aiding the enemy and was very reluctant to offer assistance to the project.\n\nAs Major AG Close of the office's PR department, himself a survivor of the Burma Railway, wrote upon review of the movie script:\n\nI do not think much of this story. In the first instance, it is quite untrue and only very occasionally resembles the facts as they were at the time. I am perhaps biased as I worked for three and a half years on this particular railway.\n\nMembers of the Far East Prisoners of War Association took umbrage with the film's suggestion that officers and laborers cooperated with the Japanese. While the movie doesn't claim to be a true story, those who really lived through the events understood the picture would influence the wider public perception of their story.\n\nWriter/director James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster Titanic was a box office smash-hit, but not everyone enjoyed the historical romance. The family of First Officer William Murdoch in particular had a bone to pick with the way the film depicted him. In the movie, Murdoch accepts but ultimately returns a bribe to the villainous Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane) as the desperate passengers try to reach the lifeboats. In the rush that follows, Murdoch guns down third-class passenger Tommy Ryan as he tries to board a lifeboat, and then, overcome with grief, takes his own life.\n\nThe real William McMaster Murdoch was an experienced naval officer from Dalbeattie, Scotland. He oversaw the ship's evacuation on the starboard side and is credited with saving many lives. The exact manner of his demise is much harder to determine. While a few theories exist, it's a mystery that can't really be solved.\n\nMurdoch's nephew sought an apology from the studio and actually got one a year later, along with a check for £5,000 (about $8,300 at the time).\n\nThe 1964 historical epic Zulu told the story of the defense of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War. It was shot on location in South Africa during apartheid. The crew was warned against mixing socially with Black crew and extras, but when an Afrikaans foreman assaulted a Black laborer, the film’s star Stanley Baker had the man fired on the spot.\n\nThe thousands of Zulus were really just 240 extras, several of whom were actually descended from the Zulu warriors who fought in the battle. In the decades since the film was made, a more rounded view of British imperialism has emerged, and Zulu has divided modern critics.\n\nAs a movie, it naturally takes a few liberties with truth for the sake of storytelling. The scale of the battle shown on screen was a fair bit larger than the real skirmish. But the most controversial change was Zulu's anti-hero, Private Henry Hook, played by James Booth. In the film, he’s shown as a drunk, a thief, and all-around ne’er-do-well, at least until the bullets fly. He finds his courage and steps up to the plate when things heat up - a pretty decent character arc, but a far cry from the real Henry Hook.\n\nThe real Hook was a career soldier with an impeccable service record who received the Victoria Cross, the highest British military honor, for his actions at Rorke’s Drift. His elderly daughters were so outraged by the film character that they walked out of the London premiere in protest.\n\nA Beautiful Mind tells the tale of genius mathematician John Nash’s struggle with schizophrenia. It was a critical and commercial success that scooped four Academy Awards at the 2002 Oscars. The film was an adaptation of Sylvia Nasar’s biography on Nash; while certain corners had to be cut for sake of the film’s runtime, other changes glossed over some uncomfortable details.\n\nThe casting of Jennifer Connelly as Alicia Nash raised some eyebrows, as Nash's real-life wife was born in El Salvador. The script also chose to leave out several details about Nash’s life that would have made for a considerably less sympathetic protagonist. He was fired from his position at the RAND corporation for indecent exposure in 1954. He also fathered an illegitimate child prior to meeting Alicia and had very little contact with the boy, also named John. Nash was scarcely in his eldest son’s life at all.\n\nNash’s relationship with Alicia was much darker than depicted in the film. A passage in the book describes how at a department picnic in 1956, before they were married, Nash threw Alicia to the ground and placed his foot on her neck to assert his apparent ownership of her. This was Nash’s idea of a joke.\n\nThey got divorced in 1963, although later they lived in the same house again, with Nash referring to himself as Alicia's “boarder.” Their son, yet another John, also lived with them. It wasn’t until the mid-1990s that they rekindled their relationship. As for that touching final speech at the film’s finale, it never happened. The couple perished in a car crash in 2015.\n\nMoneyball tells the story of how California's Oakland A’s put together a winning baseball team on shoestring budgets using clever statistical analysis to identify undervalued players. In the 2011 film, visionary general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) overcome a great deal of entrenched opposition to lead the A’s to a record-breaking winning run and the playoffs.\n\nThat’s not really how it went down in real life. The scouts, shown as out-of-touch elderly curmudgeons in the meetings, actually helped sign some key players who played a major role in the season, a fact the film carefully omits. Team manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) gets it even worse. He’s seen as actively and arrogantly resisting the efforts of Beane and Brand to put together a winning formula.\n\nHowe’s antagonistic role in the movie made for a stronger story, but did the real Art Howe a great disservice. He wasn’t wholly opposed to Beane’s ideas, but did push back on what he called the human element in baseball. While appreciating Beane’s eye for a player, the two didn’t really mesh, and Howe moved on at the end of the season. More than a decade from the film’s release, he reflected on the unfixable damage done to his reputation:\n\nWhat’re you gonna do? It’s out there. Every movie needs a bad guy. And they decided I was going to be the villain.\n\nCinderella Man charts the improbable comeback of James Braddock (Russell Crowe), a down-on-his-luck prizefighter, and his struggle to provide for his family in the midst of the Great Depression. Standing in his way to the heavyweight championship is the heavily favored world champ, Max Baer. In the movie, Baer is the archetypal bad guy, a sadistic bully dismissive of his opponent’s ability. The truth is, of course, more complicated than that.\n\nThe two in-ring deaths attributed to Baer in the movie weren’t as they might have seemed. One opponent passed five months later in a different bout, while the other fatality almost derailed Baer’s career entirely. The boxer was distraught by the tragedy and lost four of his next six fights.\n\nBaer made his name by besting two European fighters favored by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. To add insult to injury, Baer defeated Germany’s Max Schmeling with a Star of David adorning his shorts. Although not a practicing Jew himself, Baer wore the shorts in homage to his father’s Jewish roots and was a hero to a group of people increasingly marginalized by the rise of fascism in Europe. Baer became the world champ after defeating Italy’s Primo Carnera, a hulking fascist supporter of Mussolini’s Blackshirts. Baer was more than 50 pounds lighter than Carnera but floored his opponent a dozen times en route to a knockout victory.\n\nWhile Baer wasn’t the thug shown in the movie, he did indeed take Braddock too lightly going into their bout. He was a man who enjoyed the limelight, and if his son’s account is to be believed, hardly trained and received oral pleasure right before the fight. If Hollywood ever deigns to make another historical boxing movie, it could do a lot worse than make one about Baer."
