        "text": "While you can always watch the best Halloween movies year-round, there’s nothing quite like curling up on a crisp autumn night and getting scared out of your mind. Whether you’re a fan of getting completely freaked out or you prefer to keep your movie scares mild, there's an October-ready movie out there for you.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for good Halloween movies for teens, stop searching and start scrolling because we have a ton (no, really) of great ideas for your next spooky season binge sesh. From classic horror movies that have been scaring audiences for generations to new scary flicks that are instant hits to nostalgic features that warm you up better than a cup of cider, our Halloween movie list has something for everyone, no matter the mood. We’ve even rounded up where to stream them all too, so you don’t have to waste any time on getting spooked. All you need to do is light some candles, bust out the candy corn, and get ready to (trick or) treat yourself — we did, in fact, go there — to one of the best Halloween movies of all time.\n\nFull disclosure: While some of these films are indeed about or take place on Halloween, some of them are better considered “Halloween vibe movies.” They might not take place or even mention the spookiest night of the year, but they’ll surely creep you out.\n\n1. We Have a Ghost (2022)\n\nDon’t worry, there are laughs that come with this pick — it’s one of our favorite family friendly Halloween movies on Netflix. Here’s the gist: Kevin (Jahi Di'Allo Winston) and his family move into a creepy old house and quickly learn that it’s haunted by a ghost named Ernest. While they get to know the ghost and try to figure out his past, Kevin becomes a social media star after sharing videos of the spooky behavior. This might seem like there’s a lot going on, but add a CIA investigation and then you’ve got a good idea of the story you’re about to dig into.\n\nStream We Have a Ghost on Netflix.\n\n2. Run Rabbit Run (2023)\n\nA Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen classic, this movie follows the twins as they try to save their great aunt Sophia from a curse bestowed on her by her evil twin sister Agatha. The girls embark on a magic spell that can only be completed by a set of twins, with the hope of releasing Sophia from the threat of a lifetime in the netherworld. Mary Kate and Ashley’s movies are all instant classics, but this one is especially good to watch on a spooky October night.\n\nStream Double Double Toil and Trouble on Apple TV.\n\n7. Interview with a Vampire (1994)\n\nInspired by the Anne Rice novel, this movie follows the story of Lestat (Tom Cruise), a vampire who turned another man named Louis (Brad Pitt) into a vampire. Set as a flashback film, the movie kicks off with Louis telling his wild tale to a reporter. This is a horror film classic, showing both the glamorous side and the inhumane face of being a vampire.\n\nStream Interview with a Vampire on Paramount+.\n\n8. Under Wraps (1997)\n\nThis Disney film is cute, a great not-so-spooky watch for all ages. Amy, Marshall, and Gilbert — three 12-year-olds with a sense of adventure — discover a 3,000-year-old mummy. After accidentally bringing him back to life, they are suddenly tasked with getting him back to his proper resting place before midnight on Halloween. If they don’t manage to make it happen, the mummy will be doomed to live out the afterlife without reconnecting with his lost love.\n\nStream Under Wraps on Google Play.\n\n9. Silence of the Lambs (1991)\n\nClarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) is training to become an FBI agent when she’s asked to interview Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), who is in jail for murder and cannibalism. This one is not for the faint of heart or anyone who doesn’t like acts or ideation of gore — it can get intense. But the roles are played in such a detailed way that you won’t be able to shake the plot long after you’ve finished the movie.\n\nStream Silence of the Lambs on Max.\n\n10. Hellraiser (1987)\n\nThere may be 11 Hellraiser movies in total (so far), but the original is by far the most surprising. The completely unbelievable plot — unbelievable in a “this is so wild I’m glad it couldn’t happen in real life” kind of way) starts when Frank (Sean Chapman) opens a portal to hell by accidentally solving a box riddle and beckons the Cenobites, who kill him. These beings are all terrifying in their own way (think: a human-shaped monster with a head full of pins, aptly named Pinhead). After Frank’s brother and his family move into the home, they accidentally revive the last bit of Frank. The zombified Frank convinces his former lover to bring pure victims back to the house to be harvested for their blood to rebuild himself. Frank’s niece, Kirsty, gets her hands on the evil box and the plot just thickens from there.\n\nStream Hellraiser on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n11. Fright Night (1985)\n\nWell, the name of the movie gives it away, but this is a classic for a reason. Starring Kristy Swanson as Buffy, Donald Sutherland as Merrick, Hilary Swank as Kimberly, and Luke Perry as Pike, the story follows Buffy, who appears to be a normal popular high school girl at first glance. After being told about her destiny as a vampire hunter by a mysterious man (Merrick), she joins forces with Pike to help take down a powerful vampire named Lothos (Rutger Hauer). Along the way, she deals with all of the other obstacles high schoolers are up against, weaving a web that’s both relatable and completely supernatural.\n\nStream Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Max.\n\n16. Final Destination (2000)\n\nThe first of five Final Destination films, this plot takes irrational fears and turns them into reality for an unlucky group of people. The movie starts out with Alex (Devon Sawa) having a vision that the plane he’s about to fly on bursts into flames after taking off. He gets off the plane, along with six others, who watch the plane explode from the airport — just as Alex envisioned. The rest of the film follows the six who narrowly escaped death as they, well, continue attempting to escape their demise.\n\nStream Final Destination on Apple TV.\n\n17. Scooby Doo (2002)\n\nThe Mystery Inc. crew heads to Spooky Island to dig into some paranormal events. Starring Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Linda Cardellini as Velma, and Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, the plot centers around a single problem: a haunted resort that's losing guests to the mainland every day. The crew's main goal? Figure out if the spring break hot spot is actually haunted or if there's something funny going on.\n\nStream Scooby Doo on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n18. Army of Darkness (1992)\n\nIf you love time travel, dark humor, and medieval storylines, grab the popcorn. Ash, a hardware store clerk, gets kicked back to 1300 AD where he is forced to fight against a familiar enemy: the entire army of darkness, which is looking to capture his soul. Ash searches for the book of the dead, called Necronomicon, to help undo a curse that could take down both worlds. This is a sequel to The Evil Dead II (1987) which was a sequel to Evil Dead (1981), so make it a triple-feature night.\n\nStream Army of Darkness on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n19. Little Monsters (1989)\n\nThis film from Ari Aster follows Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) after they travel to Sweden with a group of friends to experience a true Midsommar celebration. But the vacation is far from relaxing, as they soon realize that the trip is full of unnerving ancient rituals.\n\nStream Midsommar on Apple TV.\n\n22. The Ritual (2017)\n\nLong-time friends gather to embark on a hiking trip in Sweden after a mutual friend tragically dies in a shooting. It begins as most lost-in-the-woods horror films do: someone gets hurt, a shortcut is decided upon, and a creepy lodge is discovered. But this is far from a run-of-the-mill horror film — it's a lesson in how to build up a monster in a terrifying way.\n\nStream The Ritual on Netflix.\n\n23. The Lodge (2020)\n\nFans of plot twists will applaud this slow-burn horror film. The plot follows two kids who are grieving after the death of their mother and are stuck with their father’s fianceé in a cabin during a snowstorm. This movie leans psychological thriller, as things get a bit surreal and triggers from the fianceé’s (Grace, played by Riley Keough) strict religious past that brings forth mind-boggling obstacles. Stick around for an ending you likely wouldn’t guess.\n\nStream The Lodge on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n24. Monster House (2006)\n\nOn Halloween night, DJ finds himself on his own with a horrible babysitter named Zee as his parents are traveling. After calling his friend Chowder for a game of basketball, the boys find trouble when the ball bounces into the neighbor Nebbercracker's lawn. Known for terrorizing kids who trespass, Nebbercracker has a heart attack as the ball crosses into his property. The boys go over to find out what happened, and quickly realize that the house is alive — and it's a monster.\n\nStream Monster House on Hulu.\n\n25. As Above So Below (2014)\n\nFans of The Blair Witch Project will love this \"found footage\" account of the terror a group of urban explorers find underneath the streets of Paris. Perdita Weeks plays archeologist Scarlett Marlowe, who is searching for Flamel's Philosopher's Stone — a treasure that will grant eternal life to its owner and turn any metal immediately into gold. They end up finding much more than that.\n\nStream As Above So Below on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n26. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019)\n\nTake a trip back to Halloween 1968 and follow along as three friends and a drifter named Ramón find a spooky notebook of stories. Stuck in the abandoned Bellows mansion, the crew discovered the author's terrifying resting place and simultaneously read through her horrifying tales.\n\nStream Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark on Hulu.\n\n27. The Descent (2005)\n\nWe all have that friend who pushes others into more adventure than they may be up to. The Descent is a story about just that. A year after a major trauma, a group of friends reunites and decides to go spelunking in a series of caves. Unbeknownst to most of the crew, the navigator has chosen to drive them to a lesser-known system of caves that are unmapped. They descend, discovering cave paintings from a civilization long past — and a horrifying monster that starts hunting them.\n\nStream The Descent on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n28. Nope (2022)\n\nLiving in the home her late husband built, Beth (Rebecca Hall) starts seeing reflections and other mysterious movements in the lake house. As she digs through her husband's boxes, she discovers that the house holds a big secret as her constant nightmares become reality.\n\nStream The Night House on Apple TV.\n\n31. Ginger Snaps (2000)\n\nFull of dark humor, Ginger Snaps follows the story of Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins) as they live life in a suburb called Bailey Downs. When Ginger is brutally attacked by a strange creature on the night of her first period, she doesn’t quite recover as expected. Brigitte is tasked with figuring out how to save her sister — and why Ginger’s wounds seem to heal immediately.\n\nStream Ginger Snaps on Peacock.\n\n32. Tucker & Dale vs. Evil (2010)\n\nWarning: This one gets gory — but it’s also funny. If you're tired of the usual \"group of friends goes camping, gets hunted by nearby evil thing\" plot, give this movie a try. Taking the other side of the story, the film follows two hillbillies as they are accused of being killers by a group of scared college kids. And while the duo is far from intentional killers, they do find themselves in tons of deadly accidents, pushing the remaining college kids to seek revenge.\n\nStream Tucker & Dale vs. Evil on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n33. The Invitation (2015)\n\nWill (Logan Marshall-Green) brings his new girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) to a dinner party at the home of his ex, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her intense partner (Michiel Huisman). All we’ll say is that it’s no ordinary dinner party.\n\nStream The Invitation on Peacock.\n\n34. Goodnight Mommy (2022)\n\nThis movie needs no introduction... and might just be the single best Halloween movie of them all. Basically, what Home Alone is to Christmas, Hocus Pocus is to Halloween. Yes, the early part of the movie does the “teenagers entering an abandoned house” cliché, but then they accidentally free three evil witches, including Bette Midler and a pre-Sex and the City Sarah Jessica Parker. The kids have to stop the witches from becoming immortal, and it’s a thoroughly entertaining, annual must-watch movie every October. Make a viewing party out of the original before the long-awaited sequel comes to Disney+ on September 30th — or stream ‘em in tandem! (On a totally not-exaggerated note, we’ve seriously been waiting for Hocus Pocus 2 for longer than the Sanderson sisters waited for a virgin to light that one candle.)\n\nStream Hocus Pocus on Disney+, Amazon Prime Video or Apple TV.\n\n37. Donnie Darko (2001)\n\nIn Donnie Darko, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the titular character, a teenager who is being influenced to do bad things by a figure in a rabbit costume named Frank. Early on, Frank warns Donnie that the world will end in 28 days. Gyllenhaal delivers one the best performances of his career in a movie that is basically a mind-blowing, perfectly eerie story that’s a must-watch before the end of the Halloween season.\n\nStream Donnie Darko on Kanopy, Amazon Prime Video or YouTube.\n\n38. Little Shop of Horrors (1986)\n\nWhat do boyfriend-gobbling, talking plants and 1960s-era rock have in common? Both are integral to Little Shop of Horrors, a cult movie that follows a flower shop employee who discovers one of his plants is sentient — and highly carnivorous. Based on an Off-Broadway show, this zany, darkly funny musical offers up plenty of camp and catchy tunes. It’s also a comedy-horror movie that doesn’t sacrifice any creepiness points for its oddball humor, meaning you’ll get plenty of both — perfect for the indecisive movie marathoners among us.\n\nStream Little Shop of Horrors on Amazon Prime Video, Tubi or Apple TV.\n\n39. Children of the Corn (1984)\n\nChildren of the Corn is one of the most horrifying franchises of all time, and we mean that in a good way. We love all seven movies, but our favorite is definitely the original, which follows a rag-tag group of kids who start worshiping a demon and murder all the adults in their hometown in exchange for a great corn harvest — because if there’s one thing kids passionately care about, it’s corn. Creepy children are a Halloween movie staple, and there’s no creepier group of kiddos than the ones in Children of the Corn.\n\nStream Children of the Corn on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Tubi, or Amazon Prime.\n\n40. Practical Magic (1998)\n\nIf you're in search of one of the best Halloween movies that will inspire a good cry, look no further than Casper. This tender ghost tale follows a lovable but lonely spirit who befriends Kat, the 13-year-old daughter of a paranormal psychologist. When a greedy woman inherits the mansion Casper haunts, Kat helps him protect his home and uncover secrets from his past. Keep some Kleenex on hand for this one.\n\nStream Casper on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, or YouTube.\n\n43. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)\n\nOver-the-top in every way, Rocky Horror Picture Show is the ultimate campy musical. Rocky Horror sweeps you up in its glamorous embrace for nearly two hours as it tells the story of a newly engaged couple who are stranded at the extravagant home of Dr. Frank N. Furter, an alien mad scientist. (Tim Curry is literally the MVP of this movie, friends.) It's loud, dramatic, and interactive—and we're here for it.\n\nStream The Rocky Horror Picture Show on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, or YouTube.\n\n44. A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)\n\nThis original 1984 slasher film introduced the world to Freddy Krueger, a madman with knives for fingers who stalks teenagers in their dreams and kills them before they can wake up. Freddy has become one of the most iconic horror villains since his mid-’80s debut. While the original Freddy was quite literally the stuff of nightmares, the version seen in the 2010 reboot starring Rooney Mara serves up the kind of Halloween scares we want this time of year.\n\nStream A Nightmare on Elm Street on HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video or YouTube.\n\n45. The Witches (1990)\n\nAnother Roald Dahl-spun fable for the win, we’re pretty sure any list of classic Halloween movies wouldn’t be complete without The Witches on it. And, no offense to Anne Hathaway in the 2020 remake, but there’s only one Grand High Witch as far as we’re concerned: Anjelica Huston. In other words, go straight for the original. It was also the last movie that Jim Henson worked on before his death, and the props and puppetry in this are truly too good.\n\nStream The Witches on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube or Apple TV.\n\n46. Fun Size (2012)\n\nBette Davis and Joan Crawford star as spinster sisters who — much to the chagrin of both — can’t seem to get away from each other. Part of that is because Blanche (Crawford) is paralyzed from the waist down and totally reliant on the kooky (read: unhinged) “Baby Jane” (Davis) decades after a mysterious car accident cut the former’s acting career short. Baby Jane had had an acting career of her own — as a child vaudeville star — and is still convinced, in her autumn years, that she’ll make it big. Blanche, meanwhile, has plans to commit little sis to a psychiatric ward. Baby Jane catches wind of those plans, and things quickly unravel from there. A definitive movie in the “hag horror” genre, it’s a worthwhile addition to any Halloween movie marathon.\n\nStream Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? on HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video or Apple TV.\n\n53. The Craft (1996)\n\nPossibly our favorite movie on this list, The Craft is about a group of '90s teenage witches who spend their time wearing knee-high socks and chokers, performing love spells, and being generally flawless. Until their magic takes control of them and they start accidentally-on-purpose murdering people, that is. This flick is a cult classic, but keep in mind that side effects of watching include an urge to wear black lipstick, break out your vintage butterfly clips, and play the Ouija board.\n\nStream The Craft on Amazon Prime Video, Philo or YouTube.\n\n54. The Blair Witch Project (1999)\n\nGrab a pint of comfort ice cream and start spoon-feeding it to yourself, because The Blair Witch Project is a completely and utterly terrifying film about friends who are murdered while shooting a documentary about—you guessed it—The Blair Witch. Many unsuspecting viewers (guilty!) thought the documentary was based on true events thanks to the movie's amazing publicity campaign and its use of found footage, aka handheld footage shot by the actors that made the horror feel even more visceral. But, real or fake, one thing's for sure: you'll be quivering under your Snuggie by the final 10 minutes of The Blair Witch Project. Without a doubt, it still gets a top billing among scary Halloween movies.\n\nStream The Blair Witch Project on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n55. Scream (1996)\n\nScream is about a terrifying masked murderer affectionately referred to as \"Ghostface\" who decides it's probably a good idea to wander around stalking a group of high schoolers, as one does. The movie features an all-star cast of '90s gems including Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, and Riverdale alum Skeet Ulrich. Scream is just as scary as it is campy, delivering slasher movie thrills alongside fun, meta commentary about the nature of horror movies. It's worth watching for the amazing circa 1996 floral prints alone.\n\nStream Scream on Paramount+ Amazon Prime Video, or Apple TV.\n\n56. Alien (1979)\n\nIn space, no one can hear you… complain about how you thought this movie was going to be a lot scarier. (Just us?) If you’re looking for a full-on fright, this might not be the pick off this Halloween movie list for you, but Alien is an iconic movie worth watching for sci-fi, horror and cat lovers alike. (The cat joke will make sense, we promise.) Plus, Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley kicks all the butt.\n\nStream Alien on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, or Apple TV.\n\n57. The Cabin in the Woods (2012)\n\nSo, you loved Chris Hemsworth in basically every MCU movie he’s appeared in, but you want to branch out? Press play on The Cabin in the Woods. Instead of flexing his biceps and being generally hunky, Hemsworth spends most of his time in this flick trying not to get murdered by a group of backwoods zombies while hanging out in a creepy forest. And if you think that’s surprising, just wait until Cabin in the Woods drops its biggest plot twist in your lap. In other words, this movie is amazing and Halloween isn't complete without at least one viewing session.\n\nStream The Cabin in the Woods on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n58. World War Z (2013)\n\nLet the Right One In isn't your average vampire movie. For one, none of the characters are covered in body glitter, and for another, they don't scamper up trees like spider monkeys. Instead, this critically-acclaimed Swedish coming-of-age story follows the childhood romance of a boy and his crush, who also happens to be a very old vampire. If you like a hefty dollop of melancholia and romance with your fear (thank you, Sweden), this is the movie for you.\n\nStream Let the Right One In on Hulu, Hoopla, Kanopy or Amazon Prime Video.\n\n63. Paranormal Activity (2009)\n\nIf you’re big on scary Halloween movies, we’re pretty sure it’s physically impossible to have avoided this one. Audiences could barely get through Paranormal Activity without flailing around in a fit of fear-induced hysteria, and we challenge you to watch the whole thing without screaming. The premise is simple: A couple moves into a haunted house and documents the supernatural activity with a simple home camera. The results? Pure, unadulterated horror. This is a found footage must-see, with special effects so convincing, you’ll believe the filmmakers actually caught a haunting on camera. Truly, the simple act of trying to get a good night’s sleep has never been so stressful, thanks to Paranormal Activity.\n\nStream Paranormal Activity on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or AppleTV.\n\n64. The Babadook (2013)\n\nLovers of storybooks, beware — the Babadook is coming for you. This Australian thriller follows a recently widowed woman (Essie Davis) as she and her young son, Sam (Noah Wiseman), deal with the grief of losing her husband. But when Sam begins to read a book that mysteriously finds its way into the house, Mister Babadook, the line between fiction and reality becomes blurred. And just as the story warns, \"If it's in a word, or if it's in a book, you can't get rid of the Babadook.” It feels worth mentioning, too, that this movie gave way to one of the most singularly iconic tweets of all time.\n\nStream The Babadook on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube or Tubi.\n\n65. The Faculty (1998)\n\nGreat scary movies contain three key elements: A tenacious troop of teenagers trying to survive, unassuming adults who fall victim to the supernatural, and Josh Hartnett — because, well, Josh Hartnett. Even though Josh hasn’t lit up the silver screen in a while, back in 1998, he stole audiences’ hearts in The Faculty. Set in Ohio, the story follows a group of students at Harrington High who are dealing with much more than studying for their SATs. When the school’s staff starts acting strangely, it’s quickly realized that the faculty’s bodies are being inhabited by alien invaders. Lots of action, snappy dialogue, and Josh Hartnett’s signature pouty face make this movie a must-watch.\n\nStream The Faculty on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n66. The Evil Dead (1981)\n\nIf horror movies have instilled any wisdom into society, it’s not to venture into the woods for spring break. Sadly, the cast of The Evil Dead didn’t get the memo. The story follows five college students who retreat to a cabin looking for a little fun. Soon after arriving, the group finds a mysterious book and tape recorder loaded with ritualistic chanting. Mayhem breaks loose when the spring breakers realize the incantations they listened to unleashed a plague of evil spirits into their domain. Will these coeds be able to fight off the demons, or will they end up possessed themselves?\n\nStream The Evil Dead on Amazon Prime Video, Tubi, Vudu, or Apple TV.\n\n67. Ju-On: The Grudge (2003)\n\nIf you watched The Grudge and have managed to stop having nightmares about its notorious staircase scene, it might be time for a refresher. Ju-On is the Japanese film that inspired The Grudge. You’ll have to commit to reading subtitles, but processing words at the bottom of the screen might help you cope with the terror that’s unfolding in front of you. Complete with a murderous family, a cursed house, and loads of innocent bystanders, Ju-On is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat (and out of strange houses).\n\nStream Ju-On: The Grudge on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play or YouTube.\n\n68. The Omen (2006)\n\nThere have been many captivating adaptations of The Omen over the years, and the 2006 retelling of the story is no exception. After losing their child, a young couple adopts a baby boy, Damien. Strange things seem to happen whenever Damien’s around, but his adoptive parents can’t put their finger on what’s causing these sinister instances. That is, until a priest tells Damien’s adoptive mother that her son is the Antichrist. Shocked and in disbelief, the woman (Julia Stiles) must find a way to put an end to her son’s evildoing — if she can do so before it’s too late.\n\nStream The Omen on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n69. American Psycho (2000)\n\nPatrick Bateman is steadfast with his routines. Whether it’s ordering the most expensive item on the menu, engaging in his ritualistic workout, or killing people and masterfully covering up the evidence. This gruesome satire stars Christian Bale as unhinged yuppie Patrick Bateman, and Reese Witherspoon as Bateman’s unsuspecting girlfriend. Released in 2000, American Psycho proves that evil comes in all forms, and sometimes evil even demonstrates an exceptional taste in business cards.\n\nStream American Psycho on Hulu, HBO Max, or Amazon Prime.\n\n70. The Exorcist (1973)\n\nIt’s a classic among scary Halloween movies for a reason. Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is a fledgling actress living on location with her daughter, Regan (Linda Blair). The two get along quite nicely until Regan plays with a Ouija board and begins to act strangely, like, “Oh shoot, I think I got possessed by a demon” strangely. Convinced her daughter is battling an evil spirit, Chris brings a priest into their home to perform an exorcism. One of the most iconic horror movies of the 20th century, The Exorcist toys with the concepts of religion and the supernatural and examines what the two have in common.\n\nStream The Exorcist on Amazon Prime Video or YouTube.\n\n71. Oculus (2014)\n\nFrom the producers of Paranormal Activity and Insidious comes a psychological thriller that will have you frantically googling “baby animals” after it’s over in an attempt to comfort yourself. Scarred by the untimely and ill-explained passing of their parents, two siblings reunite after a decade spent apart. Eager to explore what really happened on the night of their parents' death, the pair search for answers in an antique mirror that they believe houses a dark secret. But as the siblings get closer to finding out the truth, they must question reality and each other’s sanity.\n\nStream Oculus on Hulu or Amazon Prime Video.\n\n72. Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (2018)\n\nTwo best friends encounter the unthinkable: a fictitious dummy named Slappy (from an unpublished R.L. Stine novel) has come to life and is out to wreak havoc. The friends must get to work to save the entire town. If you grew up reading the Goosebumps books and have a hankering to revisit Stine’s pleasantly spooky world, this Halloween movie is the one for you.\n\nStream Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween on Fubo TV, YouTube or Amazon Prime Video.\n\n73. Zombieland (2009)\n\nThis is a zombie movie that is 10 times more hilarious than it is scary, which makes it quite perfect. Not only do you not get to scream throughout the movie, but you get to laugh. Like, a lot. Zombieland follows a group of zombie apocalypse survivors living in a nation overrun by the flesh-craving undead. Turns out, surviving in a world full of zombies is easier said than done, especially if you’re searching for a single, unsullied Twinkie or a safe haven.\n\nStream Zombieland on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n74. Hotel Transylvania (2012)\n\nHotel Transylvania isn’t just funny, it’s animated, which means the fear factor here is non-existent. The voice cast includes Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, and Kevin James. This animated movie is a story about Count Dracula running what is essentially the Four Seasons of resorts that cater specifically to every monster imaginable. Mummies? Check. Werewolves? There’s a whole litter of ‘em here. Frankenstein and his bride? They’re both checked in and ready for a long stay. But life for the monsters at Hotel Transylvania takes a turn when a human comes along, leading to lots of drama that only Dracula can fix.\n\nStream Hotel Transylvania on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n75. Frankenweenie (2012)\n\nIn Frankenweenie, a young boy’s precious dog dies, and of course, he brings it back to life. If you couldn’t tell by this single sentence, yes, this is a Tim Burton flick, so it’s somewhat aesthetically creepy. But, you can most certainly handle the scares it serves up in black-and-white, even if you yourself are a weenie when it comes to scary movies.\n\nStream Frankenweenie on Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n76. Shaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nThis movie stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar as teens who accidentally murder someone. The problem? There's a killer stalking them, and he totally knows what they did last summer. If you like your slasher movies with a hefty dose of ‘90s teen angst, I Know What You Did Last Summer is your kind of Halloween movie.\n\nStream I Know What You Did Last Summer on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n83. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)\n\nWe're still recovering from Ryan Phillipe's character being attacked with a hook in I Know What You Did Last Summer, but the 1997 sequel is unrelenting with its slasher horror energy. Luckily, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is almost as hilarious as the original is horrifying, plus it stars Brandy, along with OG cast members Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr.! How can you go wrong? Answer: you can't.\n\nStream I Still Know What You Did Last Summer on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n84. The Wicker Man (2006)\n\nTrust us: Even people who can't handle Troll 2 can handle The Haunting. There's almost nothing scary about this movie, except for how lovably bad it is. Starring the likes of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, and Liam Neeson, this movie was nominated for a whopping five Razzie Awards and is about a group of paranormal pros who shack up in a haunted mansion. Unfortunately, Casper is not a resident of said mansion, but if he were perhaps this movie would be slightly more legit.\n\nStream The Haunting on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n87. Fear (1996)\n\nOne of our favorite movies on the list, Fear stars Mark Wahlberg as a hunky bad boy who turns into a creepy stalker after he starts dating Reese Witherspoon. Our favorite scenes include the moment Mark prison tattoos \"NICOLE 4 EVA\" across his stomach, and of course the part where he muses \"I'm hip to your problems\" and then punches himself in the chest repeatedly. Good times!\n\nStream Fear on Amazon Prime Video or YouTube.\n\n88. Obsessed (2009)\n\nIf you're in the mood to watch Beyoncé and Ali Larter fling each other around a spooky house for an hour and a half while whipping their hair back and forth and being generally sassy, then Obsessed is the movie for you. Also, it revolves around Ali Larter's character being obsessed with Beyoncé, which — let's be honest — is something all of us can relate to.\n\nStream Obsessed on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n89. Ghost Ship (2002)\n\nWe know the thought of a ship full of ghosts is somewhat terrifying but fear not. Ghost Ship isn't as scary as its title implies. Yes, the film will definitely gross you out (spoiler alert: the opening mass-death scene is especially gruesome), but it knows how to balance out its scares with intrigue as it tells the story of a salvage crew trying to evade the clutches of all the undead passengers stuck on a — you guessed it — ghost ship.\n\nStream Ghost Ship on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n90. Piranha 3D (2010)\n\nPiranha 3D is perfect for those of you who prefer to scream with laughter than with fright! The movie is technically a horror/comedy, which means there are just as many LOLs as there are scares, plus it stars one of our favorite Gossip Girl alums, Jessica Szohr. Just keep in mind that the side effects of watching this movie include thinking your pet goldfish might try to eat you.\n\nStream Piranha on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.\n\n91. Cabin Fever (2003)\n\nEli Roth's Cabin Fever has all the hallmarks of the horror genre, but don't stress—it's technically a dark comedy. Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of gory gross-out moments: the movie is about a group of college grads who get attacked by a flesh-eating virus, after all. And heads up—you might want to avert your eyes during the scene where Marcy's skin falls off while she's shaving her legs in the bathtub, or you'll never be able to look at a razor again.\n\nStream Cabin Fever on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV.\n\n92. The Babysitter (2017)\n\nTeens and supernatural hijinks are a match made in Halloween movie heaven. As such, The Babysitter, starring the always wonderful Samara Weaving, is an ideal flick to watch, especially if you’re in the mood for a young teen trying to evade his murderous babysitter and her devil-worshipping clique as they try to sacrifice him for clout. Come for the gory thrills, stay for Bella Thorne’s fascinating performance as a cheerleader who dreams of becoming the next Barbara Walters.\n\nStream The Babysitter on Netflix.\n\n93. Troll 2 (1990)\n\nWelcome to the first day of the rest of your life: the day you watch Troll 2. This might just be the best worst movie ever made, and it's about—you guessed it—a bunch of deranged trolls! Only these aren't normal trolls. These little goblins are vegetarian and try their hardest to transform an innocent family into plants so they can feast on them. Because apparently store-bought veggies just won't do.\n\nStream Troll 2 on Amazon Prime Video, Tubi or Vudu.\n\n94. The Shining (1980)\n\nFans of found footage-style horror should add Unfriended to their Halloween movie marathon watch list. This screenlife horror movie, which follows a group of teens who encounter a deadly spirit during an otherwise chill Skype hangout, crams a lot onto the screen. Over the course of Unfriended’s tight 83-minute runtime, we watch protagonist Blaire (The Secret Circle alum Shelly Hennig) bounce between private text messages with her boyfriend, her Facebook message inbox, a haunting Google search, a string of disturbing YouTube videos, and the live feed of her group Skype call from hell and learn why she and her friends are being targeted. Whew, did you feel a shiver run up your spine, or is it just us?\n\nStream Unfriended on Netflix. Rent on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Apple TV for $3.99.\n\n97. It Follows (2014)\n\nVery much in the vein of John Carpenter and Wes Craven horror flicks is the indie fright-fest It Follows. Teens hooking up in a horror movie always spells doom. But, in It Follows, a casual hook-up is a death sentence for Jay (Maika Monroe), who must do everything she can to avoid the deadly specter relentlessly stalking her that is being spread amongst teens in her quiet suburban neighborhood.\n\nStream It Follows on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or YouTube.\n\n98. Get Out (2017)\n\nWhat’s better than one scary movie? Three scary movies, duh. Netflix’s Fear Street trilogy arrived earlier this year, delivering three times the chills and thrills as it unspooled one terrifying tale. Fear Street is based on the series of the same name from beloved YA author R.L. Stine. These three movies — spread across 1994, 1978, and 1666 — primarily follow a group of ‘90s teens who try to destroy an evil force responsible for serial murders throughout their hometown’s history. What they soon discover is that the origins of this evil are as old as the town itself, and it will take a lot of smarts, some clever traps, and a hefty dose of the past to understand how they can save the day. Close the blinds, grabs your popcorn, and settle in because the Fear Street trilogy is a must-see this Halloween season.\n\nStream Fear Street: Part 1 - 1994, Fear Street: Part 2 - 1978, and Fear Street: Part 3 - 1666 on Netflix.\n\n107. Us (2019)\n\nJordan Peele coolly swerved past the dreaded sophomore slump with Us, the second feature he both wrote and directed. Starring Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke, and Elisabeth Moss, Us turns up the freaky when a family’s vacation is interrupted by the sudden arrival of their doppelgängers. These unnerving doubles are here for revenge and their plan to exact it sends the family on a terrifying journey. Us will have you white-knuckling it from the minute the opening credits start, but Peele’s most recent movie is so thematically and visually engaging that you will gladly go on this very wild ride.\n\nStream Us on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Vudu.\n\n108. Halloween (1978)\n\nIs it kind of criminal that we included a Halloween sequel on this list before the original? Maybe. But here we are! Despite having a budget of just $300,000, John Carpenter’s Halloween quickly became a cultural watershed, redefining the horror genre in its wake. In 1978, it grossed $70 million worldwide — the equivalent of about $251 million today — and launched the career of OG scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. It also launched no less than 13 sequels and counting, with the latest coming out this fall. Although it may be called Halloween Ends, we’ll believe that when we see it. From the looks of it, the Michael Myers story might continue getting resurrected until the end of time.\n\nStream Halloween on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n109. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)\n\nSpeaking of now-cult films made on a shoestring budget, Iranian-American writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour funded A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night with an IndieGoGo campaign that raised $56,000. We’re pretty sure that’s the cost of snacks for shooting most movies, and yet the results were *chef’s kiss*. Shot in atmospheric black and white, our story unfolds in Bad City, an Iranian ghost town whose streets are roamed by a…. skateboarding lady vampire? Who preys specifically on men who disrespect women? Why are you still reading this Halloween movie list and not already streaming it, we ask?\n\nStream A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night on Tubi, YouTube or Vudu.\n\n110. Child’s Play (1988)\n\nNot into murder dolls? What if I told you the murder doll in question was also a queer icon? Campy and full of memorable deaths by doll, the movie that first gave us Chucky may have more LGBTQ+ subtext than overt themes, but that didn’t stop queer audiences at the time from claiming Chucky as an unlikely hero. Since then, Child’s Play creator Don Mancini — one of the few openly gay creators in the slasher movie genre — has brought Chucky back for multiple sequels, several of which include explicitly queer characters and narratives. (Chucky’s kid, Glen, is even genderfluid!)\n\nStream Child’s Play on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n111. The Thing (1982)\n\nIf you’re someone whose familiarity with John Carpenter starts and ends with the Halloween franchise, correct that pronto by pressing play on The Thing. It follows a team of scientists in Antarctica whose camp is infiltrated by a parasitic alien that can perfectly assume the form of its hosts; meaning, there’s no telling who’s infected. The props and makeup departments in this movie did the absolute most, just after Kurt Russell’s hair. The Thing is genuinely scary, but it’s also just super creatively executed, making for a year-round good watch.\n\nStream The Thing on Amazon Prime Video, AppleTV or YouTube.\n\n112. Candyman (1992, 2021)\n\nDouble feature, anyone? Candyman is about race and urban legends and public housing in Chicago. The original movie tells the story of a Black man who was horrifically murdered for his relationship with a white woman, and who now exists as a malevolent, hook-handed force in the notorious Cabrini-Green housing projects. It has a bit of mixed legacy, particularly among Black moviegoers, given that for a movie “about” the Black experience of public housing, it sure does spend a lot of time focused on its white savior-y female lead. (The original, it should also be noted, was written and directed by a white man.) The 2021 remake, meanwhile, counts Jordan Peele and Nia DaCosta as writers and director and picks back up where the original left off, as the urban legend of Candyman & Co. is pursued by a young visual artist (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II).\n\nStream Candyman (1992) on Amazon Prime Video, Tubi or Apple TV. Stream the sequel on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, or Google Play.\n\n113. Mom’s Got a Date With a Vampire (2000)\n\nFamily friendly Halloween movies from this era just hit differently. DCOM lovers won’t want to skip over this silly, solid pick in which a couple of grounded teens try to get their divorced mom back on the Dating Scene (and out of their hair) by setting her up with a dude who turns out to be a vampire. I mean, children, the man’s name was Dimitri Dentatos. What did you expect?\n\nStream Mom’s Got a Date With a Vampire on Disney+ or Amazon Prime Video.\n\n114. The Little Vampire (2000)\n\nCamp at its finest! Death Becomes Her is black-comedy gold, starring the likes of Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, and Isabella Rossellini. Helen Sharp (Hawn) is a novelist who loses her plastic surgeon fiancee (Willis) to her best frenemy, the supremely self-absorbed Madeline Ashton (Streep). After — just to warn you — at least one scene involving a truly not great fat suit moment, Hawn gets her hands on an eternal youth-giving potion. Madeline soon does the same, and highly satirical shenanigans ensue.\n\nStream Death Becomes Her on Amazon Prime Video, Hulu or YouTube.\n\n117. The VVitch (2015)\n\nIf you find yourself in need of more proof that New England’s Puritans were a low-key terrifying bunch, Robert Eggers’ directorial feature debut can give that to you. Billed as folk horror, The VVitch follows a 17th-century New England pilgrim family who, by order of the church, have been forced to go live in the wilderness. Things get supernatural, because obviously they do, and Anya Taylor-Joy does not make puberty look fun in this context.\n\nStream The VVitch on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video or Vudu.\n\n118. Labyrinth (1986)\n\nA sleeper hit — Labyrinth had a budget of $25 million and grossed barely half that in U.S. theaters during its original run — it’s now maybe one of the more iconic Halloween-adjacent movies out there. Many, if not most, of the characters are played by Jim Henson puppets, and David Bowie is a goblin king. We repeat: A goblin king! Also, a 14-year-old Jennifer Connelly is in it wearing that one white dress you’ve definitely seen photos of.\n\nStream Labyrinth on Tubi, Apple TV, or Amazon Prime Video.\n\n119. A Quiet Place (2018)\n\nA Quiet Place is one of those post-apocalyptic movies that’s genuinely scary, but also — kind of comforting? Something about seeing families band together during the End Times just works. In this telling of that story, real-life couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt star as the heads of seemingly one of few remaining families in a world terrorized by monsters with supersonic hearing. To stay alive, they have to stay — you guessed it — quiet.\n\nStream A Quiet Place on Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, or Apple TV.\n\n120. Gremlins (1984)\n\nIs it a Halloween movie? Is it a Christmas movie? Who cares! Gremlins is wacky and funny and, honestly, also pretty violent. Fun fact: If the creatures in this remind you of, say, a favored toy from your childhood, know that a big lawsuit transpired between Warner Bros. and Hasbro over the extremely Gremlin-like appearance of Furbies. Could that likeness, we ask, also be the reason Furbies were literally banned from the Pentagon? We’ll be over here asking the hard questions while you enjoy the hijinks of Gizmo the Gremlin and crew.\n\nStream Gremlins on HBO Max, Apple TV, or Amazon Prime Video.\n\n121. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nBreak out the Reese’s Pieces. E.T. remains a total tearjerker and one of our forever favorites among top Halloween movies. The score! The cinematography! The tenderness of E.T. and Elliott’s friendship, and the terror of a sick E.T. being discovered by out-of-touch adults in hazmats. Yes, it’s one of the biggest capital-M Movies of all time, but we’re also pretty sure it’s impossible for E.T. to be overrated.\n\nStream E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube or Apple TV.\n\n122. The Witches of Eastwick (1987)\n\nIt’s got Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer as witches and Jack Nicolson as the devil. Yes, some things in this life are just that good. It’s based on a novel by John Updike, and it’s supposed to be feminist in a decidedly of-its-era way. Although the movie loses some of the book’s more overt satire, our recommendation is simply to lean into the glory of getting to see these three women share a screen.\n\nStream The Witches of Eastwick on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and Apple TV.\n\n123. Friday the 13th (1980)\n\nThere are 13 Friday the 13th movies, but a 14th will undoubtedly come along at some point and spoil that. The first introduces us to the legend of hockey-masked killer Jason Voorhees who has, it seems, a pretty sex-negative stance toward the extracurricular activities of Camp Crystal camp counselors. (Given that Friday the 13th was created in a bid to hop on Halloween’s bandwagon, much slashing naturally occurs.) The Jason X sequel sees Jason venture to outer space, which is as wacky as it sounds, but it’s probably a good idea to start with the original.\n\nStream Friday the 13th on Amazon Prime Video, Tubi, or Apple TV.\n\n124. Night of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nWith Night of the Living Dead, George A. Romero is commonly credited as having created the first modern zombie movie, making it an obvious must-watch addition to the list. Most of the action takes place in an abandoned house where survivors are sheltering from flesh-eating foes — for as long as they can, at least — and the mood of apprehensive claustrophobia was inspired at least in part by Romero’s memories of World War II-era blackouts in New York City. A seminal horror movie for multiple reasons, in actor Duane Jones, it also features one of the first Black people to have a lead role in a mainstream horror film.\n\nStream Night of the Living Dead on HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu.\n\n125. Matilda (1996)\n\nIf you’re queer, grew up in the late 90s or early aughts, and are into women, there’s at least a 50% chance your first crush was Miss Honey. We don’t make the rules! Seriously, so many people have had crushes on Miss Honey, and she’s been called the original lesbain cottagecore queen. But she’s also just one of many reasons to watch this delightful Roald Dahl book-turned-heartwarming Halloween movie.\n\nStream Matilda on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video or Apple TV.\n\n126. Train to Busan (2016)\n\nIf you see the Halloween season as really just another excuse to watch zombie movies and haven’t yet seen Train to Busan, correct that stat. It’s one of the better zombiepocalypse movies out there, from a team of South Korean creators who first took the film to Cannes. Most of the action takes place on a high-speed train leaving Seoul just as a new cannibal-causing virus is taking hold, and an infected stowaway sets off a rapid (dare we say rabid?) chain of events that’ll, truly, keep you on your seat’s edge.\n\nStream Train to Busan on Tubi, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube or Vudu.\n\n127. The Love Witch (2016)\n\nBilled alternately as retro fantasy-horror, kitschy sexploitation and, according to one IMDb reviewer, “overrated, unfunny, tacky and annoying,” The Love Witch follows Elaine Parks (Samantha Robinson) on her quest to make men fall in love with her with sex magick. It, for the record, is funny, in a trope-y sort of way, and it’s full of Grade-A monochromatic outfits, beautifully stylized shots, and tarot references. We’d say that’s worth a watch!\n\nStream The Love Witch on Amazon Prime Video, YouTube or Apple TV.\n\n128. The Ring (2002)\n\nWe know you slept with the lights on after seeing this at a preteen-era sleepover. (And possibly kept them on for a month afterward; again we ask, just us?) That said, if you’re watching this for the first time not as a preteen, or if you’re simply someone with a stronger constitution than us, you might actually find The Ring kind of ridiculous and a fun one to snicker through. It could go either way, but regardless of which camp you’re in, we think you’ll agree that Samara makes for a memorable supernatural antagonist.\n\nStream The Ring on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV or Paramount+.\n\n129. Under the Shadow (2016)\n\nIf we’re being totally honest, this psychological horror movie, from Iranian-born writer and director Babak Anvari, is maybe the best movie on this list. Seriously, it’s that good. Taking place during the Iran-Iraq war, it tells the story of a mother, Shideh (Narges Rashidi), her young daughter, Dorsa (Avin Manshadi), and a mysterious evil force that seems to have taken up residence within the family’s missile-torn apartment building — and potentially, it seems, also within Dorsa. The whole movie is in Persian, but assuming you’re someone who does need subtitles, we’re here to assure you they’re well worth it.\n\nStream Under the Shadow on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Vudu.\n\n130. Young Frankenstein (1974)"
