        "text": "More than a year in the making, these 16 films are the work of undergraduate students in the Documentary Journalism Program at the Jonathan B. Murray Center for Documentary Journalism at the Missouri School of Journalism.\n\nThe subject matter of each film below is the personal choice of its director, approved by a panel of documentary experts and guided by visiting artists, faculty and peers. The directors were given a great deal of editorial and creative control over their films, nudged in the right direction by those they trusted the most.\n\nThis year’s festival once again takes place in the historic Missouri Theatre, a 1920s movie palace ideal for watching the films on the big screen. The festival happens on Thursday, May 12 with films screening at 1 pm, 4 pm and 7 pm. The online festival runs for one week here on MethodMFilms.com, from May 13 to May 19.\n\nThis is the sixth annual Stronger Than Fiction Film Festival once again shows how directors can take their films in many different directions to define their own approaches to what makes a good documentary. The films represent the visions of sixteen talented people poised to begin some impressive careers. Enjoy catching them as they begin their professional climbs.\n\n-Robert Greene, Filmmaker-in-Chief\n\n-Stacey Woelfel, Director\n\nFestival Jury\n\nChloe Gbai is an Emmy-nominated producer and creative exec on the Original Documentary Films team at Netflix. She joined Netflix from IF/Then Shorts at Field of Vision, a program that identifies and supports original, standalone short documentaries made by filmmakers working in and representing their communities.

She is a proud member of Brown Girls Doc Mafia, a 2020 Impact Partners Producing Fellow, a DOC NYC New Leader, and a member-in-residence of the Meerkat Media Collective.\n\nEric Hynes is a New York-based film critic and reporter, as well as Curator of Film at Museum of the Moving Image. He has written for the New York Times, Film Comment, Rolling Stone, IndieWire, Slate, the Village Voice, and Time Out New York.

Cameron Geeding\n\nIn a Central Florida retirement park, the residents of Buttonwood Bay navigate tropical storms and an ever-aging population as they act in defiance of what seems to always linger over them: death. Here lives Noreen and her sister Sharon as they spend the remainder of their idyllic lives in this tight-knit community of merriment. Accept & Embrace demonstrates the process of transitioning from an observational to reflexive style as the filmmaker is forced to confront his relation to the film’s central participant, his grandmother, and how the nature of his photography might intrude on this community of wisdom and embracement.\n\nCarrie in Control\n\ndir. Barb Kuensting\n\nFaced with unaccepting parents and the trauma from a tumultuous childhood in the Catholic Church, 22-year-old Carrie is at an identity crossroads. When her exotic dancing days end abruptly, she’s forced to reckon with her reality and question the chains she’s worn her entire life. Her only consistency, animals, are a symbol of hope – but even they are struggling at the hands of those above them. Will she find the strength to stand up for herself and those she loves, or will the comfort of the pain lure her in longer? - WINNER, STACEY WOELFEL AWARD FOR INNOVATIVE JOURNALISM\n\nI’ve Never Been in a Fight\n\ndir. Andrew Moore\n\nHave you ever been in a fight? Even thrown a punch? Because Andrew never has. His mom raised him as a pacifist, and she would like to keep it that way. But deep down, Andrew has a question: how much can he know about himself if he’s never been punched in the face? More importantly: how much can he know about his mom, the woman that has sacrificed so much for him, if he’s never fought for anything?\n\nMan at Work\n\ndir. Cleo Norman\n\nMan at Work follows a day in the life of the filmmaker’s father. Ebby Norman has owned and operated his bike shop, Pro-Velo, for almost 20 years. And he has no plans of stopping. At the bike shop, he is surrounded by conversation in the barber shop-like environment that has been created there. But as old memories and breaking news swirl around him, he stays focused on his craft. Man at Work relishes in Ebby’s humble memories, recalling all the reasons that he has found himself in this special place. In the cluttered spaces, Ebby finds moments of reflection and accountability, and reminds us that we are all constantly at work on our craft and the relationships that make up our daily life, while also constantly at work on ourselves."
