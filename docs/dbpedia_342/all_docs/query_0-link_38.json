        "text": "Missing is one of the most popular thrillers from recent years and had an impressive box office run when it premiered. The movie is a modern take on a missing person's case that relies on the digital world of the internet and social media but still sticks to the common tropes of a classic mystery. Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick's movie is a must-see for any movie fan who loves a good mystery, but there are a handful of other epic thrillers about missing persons that should be considered as well.\n\nMissing person movies are a popular sub-genre in the mystery category, and understandably so. Because they provide viewers with an intense adrenaline rush and force them to put their thinking caps on, moviegoers frequently find themselves reaching for these films when they are up for a challenge and plan to see something that will keep them entertained throughout its entirety. Films such as Prisoners, All Good Things, and Gone Baby Gone are just a few flicks like Missing that every film fanatic should check out after seeing the film.\n\n17 'What Lies Beneath' (2000)\n\nDirected by Robert Zemeckis\n\nIt has been a year since Claire's (Michelle Pfeiffer) husband, Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford) cheated on her, but their marriage appears to be back on track, appearing like any normal, happily married couple. Claire's bliss is soon interrupted when she starts to experience strange occurrences and hears voices, forcing her to believe that something or someone is trying to tell her something.\n\nWhat Lies Beneath is a suspense-filled Hitchcockian thriller that centers around a wife trying to find out why her husband is secretly following a missing person's case. With plenty of jump scares and a jaw-dropping revelation, Ford and Pfeiffer paint the ideal picture of a perfect married couple, giving top-notch performances in this horror mystery without revealing a shocking twist.\n\nWatch on Paramount+\n\n16 'Night Moves' (1975)\n\nDirected by Arthur Penn\n\nGene Hackman stars as private eye Harry Moseby in Night Moves, where his character is hired by an aging B-movie movie star (Janet Ward) to find her daughter, Delly (Melanie Griffith), who has run away from home. His search eventually leads him to the Florida Keys, where he discovers that Delly is with her stepdad (John Crawford) and his girlfriend, Paula (Jennifer Warren), but as he gets closer to Delly and her situation, he realizes the case also involves a homicide.\n\nNight Moves is a thrilling neo-noir that takes what seems to be an ordinary missing persons case that has a simple resolution only to reveal a much more devious, complex scenario with a major unexpected twist that will leave audiences jaw-dropped. Initially, Night Moves wasn't a major success, but in recent years, it has gained immense support and is considered to be a cult classic. This top-tier missing persons film also stars James Woods, Kenneth Mars, and North by Northwest star, Edward Binns.\n\nRent on Amazon\n\n15 'Kiss the Girls' (1997)\n\nDirected by Gary Fleder\n\nWhen a forensic psychologist, Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), discovers his niece has been kidnapped, he offers his assistance to local detectives, who believe she has been taken by a serial killer known as Casanova. As Cross and the detectives work relentlessly to find Cross' niece as well as several other missing women they believe have been taken by the deranged killer, one of his victims (Ashley Judd) manages to escape, becoming a crucial part of their investigation.\n\nKiss the Girls is a neo-noir psychological thriller based on the best-selling 1995 novel written by James Patterson and also stars Cary Elwes, Jeremy Piven, and Tony Goldwyn. The movie follows an intense breadcrumb trail that ends with a shell-shocking twist that is simply chilling to the core. Between the more than capable cast and Patterson's unique take on a classic, terrifying serial killer, Kiss the Girls is an essential missing persons film that will keep you up at night.\n\n14 'Mississippi Burning' (1988)\n\nDirected by Alan Parker\n\nWhen a group of civil rights activists goes missing in a small Mississippi town, two FBI agents, Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), are sent to investigate the disturbing disappearance. Once they arrive, they're met with pushback by the local authorities who refuse to help or cooperate with their investigation, but with or without them, the federal agents are determined to find out what happened to the young activists and who is behind their senseless disappearance.\n\nThe Oscar-winning film Mississippi Burning is loosely based on the 1964 murders of three young activists, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. The film gives a raw, gritty portrayal of deep-seated racism as well as providing awareness to three young lives that were unfairly cut short, making it a crucial film that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. The slow-burn mystery movie received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Picture – it ended up winning the Oscar for Best Cinematography.\n\nWatch on Tubi\n\n13 'The Girl on the Train' (2016)\n\nDirected by Tate Taylor\n\nRachel Watson (Emily Blunt) is a daily train commuter who soon becomes invested in a seemingly perfect couple, Scott and Megan, catching minor glimpses of them as she passes them by.

Durst was a fan of the film and after refusing to talk to any reporters, he agreed to sit down with the film's director, Andrew Jarecki for his miniseries, The Jinx.

The movie is an intense look into not only a parent's immense grief but also the extreme lengths that they are willing to go to for their child. While Prisoners appears to be a basic missing persons movie, there's an unexpected twist that turns the entire story upside down.\n\n7 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' (2011)\n\nDirected by David Fincher\n\nStarring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a fantastic exhibit of David Fincher's talents. The crime mystery drama follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist who attempts to find a woman missing for 40 years with the help of computer hacker Lisabeth Salander, who has a troubled.\n\nAlso based on a book of the same name (by Swedish author and journalist StiegLarsson), this edge-of-your-seat film is guaranteed to provide audiences with an unforgettable time.

Cho had originally turned the part down but after talking to Merrick and Johnson, he had a better understanding of their vision and obviously, changed his mind. According to the film's commentary, Messing's character, Rosemary Vic, is a homage to Rosemary's Baby and Michael Chiklis' character, Vic Makey, from the television series The Shield.\n\n5 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007)\n\nDirected by Ben Affleck\n\nPatrick's a private eye who is hired to look into the missing person's case of a 4-year-old named Amanda.
