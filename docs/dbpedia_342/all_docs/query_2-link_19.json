        "text": "1. The film was NOT shot at Rorke's Drift\n\nCy Endfield's epic military marathon about the Battle of Rorke's Drift was actually shot 90 miles south-west of Rorke's Drift in the Royal Natal National Park in the KwaZulu Natal province of South Africa. It is an area far more mountainous and picturesque than the real site of the battle.\n\n2. Many of the Zulu extras had never seen a motion picture\n\nMany of the Zulus who were hired as extras for the film had never seen a motion picture prior to filming and were unsure what to expect. With this in mind, director Cy Endfield and Stanley Baker, who played Lieutenant John Chard, set up a projector in order for them to watch a western, starring Gene Autry. It is understood things became much clearer thereafter.\n\nA western, starring Gene Autry, was the first motion picture the Zulu extras ever saw (Rex Features)\n\n3. Contrary to popular belief, the Zulus were NOT paid in cattle\n\nRumours have long circulated that the Zulu extras were paid with cattle rather than cash. It has been suggested that this was one way of negotiating strict Apartheid laws that prohibited the Zulus from receiving equal payment to their white counterparts. This is incorrect. All the Zulus received full payment in Rand.\n\n4. Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead was extremely deaf...\n\nPlayed expertly by Michael Caine, this snobbish character was described by Lieutenant Henry Curling, who fought alongside Bromhead at Rorke's Drift, as \"a stupid old fellow, as deaf as a post.\" It was this, as well as his later commissioning date (Bromhead in fact commissioned three years later than Lieutenant Chard, rather than the mere three months suggested in the film), that led to him relinquishing power to Chard during the battle.\n\nMicahel Caine (right) as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Film Stills)\n\n5. ...and it appears he wasn't much of a soldier either\n\nMajor Francis Clery, who spent time with Bromhead after Rorke's Drift, described him as \"a capital fellow at everything except soldiering\", while his commanding officer said in private that Bromhead was \"hopeless\". Bromhead did, however, receive the Victoria Cross for his part in the Battle of Rorke's Drift.\n\nREAD: Michael Caine: Extraordinarily good and spectacularly awful\n\n6. Michael Caine initially auditioned for the role of Private Henry Hook\n\nThis was Michael Caine's first major film role and, although he eventually put in an exceptional performance as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, he was crippled by nerves and beaten to the role he initially auditioned for, that of Private Henry Hook, by James Booth. Interestingly, Caine was also unable to ride a horse so a member of the filming crew took his place in the scene where he crosses the stream on horseback at the beginning of the film. This explains why the camera pans down on to the horse.\n\nREAD: Michael Caine thought Zulu would mark 'end' of his career\n\n7. Private Henry Hook was teetotal\n\nIn the film, Private Henry Hook (James Booth) is placed under arrest for insubordination. He is seen lounging around in the shade and trying to pilfer free booze as his comrades prepare for battle in the stifling heat. In reality, Private Hook was an exemplary soldier and teetotal, who was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. Hook's daughter walked out of the film's premiere in disgust at this inaccurate portrayal.\n\n8. Stanley Baker had a run-in with the South African authorities\n\nThe film was shot in South Africa at a time when Apartheid laws were strictly enforced. On being told that conducting sexual relations with other races was a criminal offence, punishable by flogging, Baker is rumoured to have asked whether he could take the punishment while in the act. More seriously, Baker was appalled by the racism he saw and fired an Afrikaans man working on set who had punched a black labourer.\n\n9. A remarkable 11 British soldiers won the Victoria Cross, but 12 were nominated\n\nColour Sergeant Frank Bourne (played by Nigel Green in the film), requested a commission rather than the Victoria Cross. He was duly granted this wish and went on to become a Lieutenant Colonel. When he died in 1945, he was the last surviving British soldier from the battle.\n\n10. In the film, Zulu King Cetshwayo kaMpande was played by his great-grandson\n\nMangosuthu Buthelezi was the chieftain of the Buthelezi tribe when he played the role of Zulu King Cetshwayo kaMpande in 1964. Buthelezi went on to found the Inkatha Freedom Party and is the former prime minister of the KwaZulu bantustan. He has regularly held positions in South African parliament.\n\nMangosuthu Buthelezi (right) with Nelson Mandela (AFP)\n\nIN PICTURES:"
