        "text": "Choosing Courses That Interest You\n\nMany Honors College (HNRS) classes are topical seminars, which means that the catalog descriptions are more general than the section descriptions. With our program, you'll be able to choose seminars and classes that align with your interests and specializations. The more specific section descriptions are on this page.\n\nFall 2024\n\nHNRS 122 Reading the Arts\n\nChesapeake Literature\n\nPaul Haspel: Section 001 - TR 12pm-1:15pm\n\nThe Chesapeake region was the site of the first successful effort to establish a permanent English colony in North America, at Jamestown in 1607. Early visitors marveled at the Bay’s rich resources, including the crabs, oysters, fish and other seafood for which the Chesapeake is renowned. Today, the Chesapeake region is home to four major metropolitan areas, including the nation’s capital; but overpopulation, commercial development, pollution, and climate change make the Chesapeake of today a threatened resource. This course looks at this important region – one in which every student on the Mason campus has chosen to study – through a survey of literature of the Chesapeake region from the colonial period through the present day. The class will discuss the work of Chesapeake-region authors like Captain John Smith, Frederick Douglass, George Alfred Townsend, Adele V. Holden, Gilbert Byron, John Barth, William Styron, Helen Chappell, Marguerite Henry, Katherine Paterson, and William H. Warner. Topics to be discussed will include colonialism, race, religion, social class, and differing attitudes regarding the use of natural resources.\n\nUS Life & Identity in Poetry\n\nLori Rottenberg: Section 002 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThink poetry is just something you have to learn to get through high school English, with no relevance to your life or today’s world? Buckle up and think again! In this class, we will be exploring visceral, accessible poetry that probes what it is to be an American, in so many of its numerous identities. We will discuss what makes poetry “poetry” and read and analyze important poets from the last 20 years, covering a broad range of styles and personal perspectives. We will review the terms we need for analyzing poetry and examine how each poet makes meaning through their choices on the page. We will also be giving YOU the chance to write and workshop your own original poetry! Our tentative reading list includes Natasha Trethewey, Victoria Chang, Ocean Vuong, Craig Santos Perez, Claudia Rankine, Ada Limón, Layli Long Soldier, Philip B. Williams, Brian Turner, and others. (Please note that as poetry often deals with sensitive issues involving race, gender, sexuality, class, war, oppression, history, environmental destruction, and personal trauma, these topics may be discussed in this class.) Get ready to talk, interact, share, create, and learn!\n\nRuins of the Apocalypse\n\nBenjamin Renne: Section 003 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm and Section 004 - MW 3pm-4:15pm\n\nThe apocalypse is upon us! So what comes next? In this course we will examine the literature of ruin. Through close literary analysis, creative artistic response, and critical discussion of speculative fiction (SF), poetry, film, anime, and video games, we will explore the possible futures left to us in the wake of apocalypse. With particular emphasis on survival, community, and resilience, we will encounter the various survivors of ruin: scavengers and shapeshifters, mutants and monsters, and the mythic remnants of the human past. Our exploration will be guided by the following key questions: What is our (human) relationship to the apocalypse? What is useful or even necessary about imagining our future ruin? How can art and literature prepare us to survive apocalyptic scenarios of the present and future? How can possibility, justice, wonder, and even delight exist amid destruction?\n\nThe Art of Memory\n\nJames Savage: Section 005 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nIn Ancient Greece, a good memory was celebrated as both essential to any orator as well as a way of communicating with and memorializing the dead. What has become of the concept of memory since that time? What role does memory (both individual and collective) play in our lives today, particularly as we remember traumatic events and the loss of loved ones? And how do artists use memory to understand the past and heal from moments of loss and trauma? These questions will be examined in this course through various genres, including academic writing, fiction, creative nonfiction, live storytelling, film, and poetry. The semester will culminate in a Moth Story Slam that asks students to tell a story aloud from memory.\n\nCreative Nonfiction: The Story of YOU!\n\nAimee Weinstein: Section 006 - MW 10:30am-11:45am and Section 007 - MW 12pm-1:15pm\n\nWhat does it mean to tell your story? How does an ordinary person put together descriptions, thoughts and reflections to create a work that is truly extraordinary? This course will focus on the definition of creative nonfiction as separate from journalism, essays or other works of nonfiction that are less biographical and creative. Our end goal is to create something ourselves that is read-worthy by someone other than our mothers and to imagine ourselves as authors of the story of our lives. We will explore how writers do not only tell their stories – as in WHAT happened – but also the ways they reflect on their snippet of reality, how they make sense of the experiences and how they bring those experiences to life for the reader. How do they succeed in making their regular lives vivid and interesting to an outside reader?\n\nLiterature and Film of War\n\nRichard Nanian: Section 008 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nAt first glance, literature and war have little connection. Literature is about creating something; war is the most destructive activity in which human beings engage. Writing usually requires order, quiet, and solitude; war creates chaos and noise, and requires an enemy. The medium of film, too, initially seems inadequate to the truth of war. War is usually long, and the repercussions from war last much longer; a film has only a few hours at most in which to tell its story. Given that war has been a nearly constant facet of human existence, though, it would be surprising if writers and film-makers did not attempt to capture some of the reality of war within their works. Moreover, literature and film both virtually require both irony and paradox, and war provides both. As terrible as war is, it also provides the opportunity to demonstrate many qualities that we admire, such as courage, camaraderie, and occasionally chivalry. As deadly as war is, proximity to death makes one feel more alive than one might otherwise. As brutal as war is, it can also be spectacular and awe-inspiring. War is not only a suitable subject for both literature and film but a nearly irresistible one._x000B_ This course requires reading literary works and watching films, as well as contributing short writing assignments to the class discussion board, but no outside research or formal essays.\n\nFictions of Identity\n\nDeborah Forbes: Section 009 - TR 3pm-4:15pm and Section 010 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nA core part of human culture is telling stories that aren’t true. Why do we create fiction, and how does this work relate to our understanding of ourselves and others? How do we judge authenticity in an imagined world? This course follows the development of realistic fiction in English from the origins of the novel in the late 1600s to the present day. We’ll pay particular attention to authors who write from the point of view of characters with a racial or gender identity different from their own. What can they tell us about the line between representation and appropriation, empathy and exploitation? How have our moral preoccupations evolved over time? Together we will develop individual criteria for evaluating the boundary crossing fiction involves. The coursework will emphasize critical analysis, but we will also undertake creative experiments to test the limits of our ability to imagine ourselves as someone else.\n\nInquiry in Science Fiction\n\nCarlos Chism: Section 011 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nScience fiction is often discussed as primarily speculative, or as a tool for predicting the future. But some of the greatest authors of the genre, from Mary Shelley to Phillip K. Dick and NK Jemisin, demonstrate the genre serves less as a crystal ball to predict the future, and more like a mirror to reflect on and question our present. Through what Ursula K. Le Guin describes as the “peculiar, devious, and thought-experimental manner proper to science fiction,” the genre helps us ask probing questions about the world around us. In this course, we will examine science fiction across a range of time periods, subgenres, and modalities to better understand how the genre can help us ask critical questions about social, cultural, and political issues in the world today. We will read novels, short stories, and screen TV episodes to analyze how various works both use and subvert conventions of the genre to construct piercing questions and probe for new answers. Through engaging with these texts, we will develop skills of critical reading, inquiry, and analysis, so that we can ask revealing questions of the world around us in the spirit of Octavia Butler’s observation that “there is nothing new under the sun, but there are new suns.”\n\nHNRS 130 Identity, Community, Difference\n\nGender, Sexuality, and 1990s Culture\n\nDavid Corwin: Section 002 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nThis section will focus on how the 1990s was a critical decade for issues related to gender and sexuality and intersecting identities. Coming off the heels of Apartheid in South Africa, The Reagan Administration, the Cold War, and many other international political events and in the midst of the HIV/AIDs epidemic, LGBTQ+ activism, and third wave feminist politics, the 90s served as a transition decade to move us into the twenty-first century. Through literature, television, film, music, historical and theoretical texts, this course will focus on issues related to women and LGBTQ+ people in light of the sociological and historical context of the decade and how representation is indeed a political act that shapes culture.\n\nThe Power of Place: Examining Locality’s Influence on Identity\n\nAmanda Bryan: Section 003 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThe world space we occupy influences each of us greatly; it builds individuals into a community. This community (where we live and when we come from) often shapes how we respond to the situations in our life as well as how we empathize with others with similar or different experiences. I posit that our identities are significantly influenced by our historical (childhood and young adult) localities. This course will focus on the broad concept of “place” as a power or pressure – sometimes positive and sometimes negative – on identities and one’s capacities to build new communities, especially those across differences. Drawing from physics’ Principle of Locality, nonlocality, and entanglement theory, we will consider (mostly) fictional, narrative characters’ responses to various situations and how their place influences their actions and thought processes. Our texts will be multinational, including some focused on the various regions of the United States, the Caribbean, India, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom across the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. We will analyze novels/novellas, short stories, poetry, as well as musical compositions and paintings as texts. (Disclosure: I am not a physics professor, and no knowledge of physics is required.)\n\nExploring Differences & Celebrating our Commonalities\n\nKhaseem Davis: Section 004 - W 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nIn a world that can be chaotic, divisive, and hostile, \"Exploring Differences & Celebrating Our Commonalities\" offers a comprehensive journey into the intricacies of human uniqueness and unity. This course delves into the multifaceted aspects of what sets us apart – be it cultural backgrounds, personal identities, or lived experiences – while celebrating the threads that bind us together as a global community. Throughout this course, students will reflect and explore ways in which individuals and communities differ. From examining our rich cultural traditions and practices to delving into the nuances of personal identity and background, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity that defines human existence. Through introspective exercises and engaging discussions, students will identify and celebrate the unique attributes that contribute to the rich mosaic of humanity. Exploring Differences & Celebrating Our Commonalities goes beyond mere acknowledgment of diversity by actively seeking out common ground among individuals and groups. This course will emphasize our shared values, aspirations, and experiences, and will foster greater understanding and empathy among students. Through collaborative activities and dialogue, participants will work to transcend superficial differences necessary to connect on a deeper level. The purpose of this course is twofold: to deepen our understanding and appreciation of difference and cultivate a sense of interconnectedness. Students will leave this course equipped with the tools to navigate complex cultural landscapes and foster an environment of mutual respect and appreciation; this course will lay a solid foundation for scholarly exploration.\n\nIdentity in Video Games\n\nSeth Hudson: Section 005 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nThis class explores the function of identity in video game culture(s). By engaging related scholarship, journalism, and games themselves, we will seek the intersections of player experiences with the evolving medium and communities that surround it. What do we play? How do we play? What do the answers to these questions say about us?\n\nKnow Thyself: Insights from the Psychology of Self-Knowledge\n\nLauren Kuykendall: Section 006 - MW 3pm-4:15pm\n\nThis class will explore the significance of self-knowledge for a fulfilling life and the possibilities for knowing ourselves better. We will begin by investigating when and why self-knowledge matters for a good life, examining its impact on well-being, decision-making, careers, and relationships. We will learn why obtaining self-knowledge is so challenging, particularly when relying on introspection. Then, focusing primarily on insights from the psychological sciences–with occasional input from philosophy and other relevant disciplines–we will consider a variety of strategies for increasing self-knowledge, including: (1) learning about common biases and bias reduction strategies, (2) becoming skillful observers of our emotions and actions, (3) knowing ourselves through others, (4) making sense of the multiple traits, values, and group identities that define us and how they fit together, and (5) narrating our stories in ways that foster purpose and coherence. We will experiment with these strategies for knowing ourselves better and reflect on our experiences with each other. Through practical experimentation with these strategies and reflective discussions with peers, this course will empower students to articulate personally meaningful reasons and strategies for pursuing self-knowledge.\n\nThe American Dilemma: Race, Caste and Social Inequality in the 21st Century\n\nPatricia Masters: Section 007 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nIn 1938, the Swedish economist and sociologist, Gunnar Myrdal was engaged by the Carnegie Foundation to study and document the social and economic inequities faced by Southern Black Americans. His book, The American Dilemma, highlights the discrepancy between the American ideals of freedom, democracy, and equality, and the American realities of discrimination, prejudice, and exclusion blacks faced in their everyday lives. This problem was, Myrdal asserted, the greatest challenge facing America. In the 21st Century it remains an unresolved dilemma. There are three components of this course. First, there is the history of chattel slavery beginning in 1619 when the first Africans arrived in Virginia. We examine the process through which categories of White and Black were constructed in practice and through law. This will be followed by a discussion of Isabel Wilkerson’s “Eight Pillars” of the American caste system the underlies and legitimates a hierarchy of races. Secondly, we will analyze the Civil Rights Movement and the unique roles played by Martin Luther King and Malcolm X in framing demands for racial equality and the legislative outcomes of their powerful movement. Thirdly, we will discuss the resistance to the programs advancing positive racial change and the increasing importance of media and the uses of media images and symbols in creating negative, or positive racial images and symbols. Accompanying the discussion of media will be an analysis of specific political ideologies, including white supremacy and its impact on questions surrounding race in the national dialogue. Using social-psychological studies of such groups we will explore the motivations and fears that drive individuals to seek and support these groups. All of the issues discussed force us to again re-visit Myrdal’s American Dilemma and raise the question as to whether the American Creed will ever correspond to the American Deed.\n\nLiberalism and its Critics\n\nTheodore Kinnaman: Section 008 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nAmerican society is a liberal one that professes to value freedom above all else. But are human beings naturally suited for life in liberal democracy, or must we be taught how to be free? Are people equally suited to be citizens in a democracy? What is this freedom we value so much? We will consider these questions as they are addressed in philosophical works by Plato, Mill, Locke, and Rawls, as well as conservative, communitarian, and feminist critiques of liberalism.\n\nIdentity-Based Conflict\n\nTabatha Hargrove: Section 009 - MW 12pm-1:15pm\n\nThis course delves into the complex dynamics of identity-based conflicts, exploring the intersection of individual and group identities in conflict situations. Students will examine the role of identities such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and nationality in shaping conflicts and learn strategies for conflict resolution and reconciliation. Through case studies and interactive discussions, participants will gain a deeper understanding of the impact of identity on conflicts and develop skills to navigate and address identity-based tensions effectively. In this course on Identity-Based Conflicts, participants will explore the psychological and sociological aspects that contribute to conflicts rooted in identity. By analyzing historical and contemporary examples, students will gain insights into the complexities of identity dynamics and their influence on conflict escalation and resolution. Through a combination of class discussions, group activities, and simulations, learners will develop critical thinking skills and practical approaches to address identity-based conflicts in diverse contexts. Additionally, the course will provide opportunities for reflection and dialogue to promote empathy, understanding, and constructive engagement in conflict transformation processes. Students in the Identity-Based Conflicts course will engage with theories and frameworks that help dissect the underlying causes of identity-based tensions. They will also explore the role of power dynamics, historical narratives, and communication strategies in shaping conflict outcomes. Through experiential learning activities and guest lectures from practitioners in the field, students will deepen their understanding of the complexities of identity conflicts and gain insights into innovative approaches to fostering reconciliation and peacebuilding. The course aims to equip participants with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills to navigate identity-based conflicts with sensitivity, empathy, and effectiveness. The main focus of the Identity-Based Conflicts course is to examine the psychological and sociological dimensions of conflicts that stem from identity differences. Participants will delve into the complexities of how identity factors such as ethnicity, religion, nationality, and ideology can influence the dynamics of conflict escalation and resolution. The course emphasizes understanding the root causes of identity-based tensions, exploring strategies for constructive engagement, and developing skills for promoting reconciliation and peacebuilding in diverse and challenging contexts. Ultimately, the course aims to equip learners with the knowledge and tools to navigate identity-based conflicts with empathy, critical thinking, and a commitment to positive social change.\n\nExperiencing Difference\n\nLisa Sechrest-Ehrhardt: Section 010 - MW 10:30am-11:45am and Section 011 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nDiversity in the United States provides a rich, yet complicated environment regarding social interaction among people from varying racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. Different world perspectives affect behavior in social interactions and can have positive and or negative consequences. How does a person’s race, ethnicity, or gender affect his or her interactions with others? Students will be introduced to Social Interaction Theory and Cognitive Theory which provide a robust foundation for navigating diverse social interactions. Using inquiry and collaborative learning processes students will learn how these theories provide an understanding to what one “brings” to communications and exchanges with others. Students will examine the “intersectionality” of race, ethnicity, gender, ability, socioeconomic status, and age to comprehend the importance of self-awareness in the process of understanding self, others and community.\n\nDisability, Health and Illness\n\nClaudia Rector: Section DL1 - MW 9am-10:15am and Section DL2 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThis course considers how identity intersects with the body, specifically with disability, health and illness. We will examine how identity in the contemporary U.S. is shaped by physical difference, and consider what possibilities are created or foreclosed by various imaginings of both identity and disability. Specific topics to be considered include (among others): eugenics, the medical model of disability and the disability rights response, chronic illness, Deaf culture, abortion, mental health/illness, disability studies, non-violent resistance, and COVID.\n\nHNRS 131 Contemporary Social Issues\n\nMarkets and Morality\n\nVirgil Storr: Section 001 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis seminar will explore key writings on the relationship between markets and morality. The course will, thus, also focus on a number of the critical debates that have occupied political economists and moral philosophers over the years about the moral underpinnings of market societies, the moral nature of market activities, and the moral status of market outcomes. The goal of the class is to prepare students to understand and engage in the contemporary debates around these issues.\n\nSea-Level Rise & Social Impact\n\nMatthew Sedlar: Section 002 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nAs global temperatures rise, coastal cities find themselves on the front lines of a battle against the forces of climate change. As sea levels inexorably rise, these cities are witnessing the gradual submergence of their once-familiar landscapes. The threat posed by the encroaching sea is multifaceted and far-reaching, encompassing everything from the erosion of beaches and the salinization of freshwater sources to the inundation of critical infrastructure and the displacement of entire communities. This course will closely examine case studies from Norfolk, VA, to New Orleans and Miami to understand the impacts of rising sea levels. Students will leave this course knowing the effects of rising sea levels on society and the types of efforts underway to mitigate its impacts.\n\nEliminating Global Hunger: Problems, Progress, and Challenges\n\nPhillip Thomas: Section 003 - MW 12pm-1:15pm\n\nGlobal hunger is one of the most critical problems confronting the global community in the 21st Century. Despite numerous efforts over the past 50 years its elimination remains elusive due to a complex array of environmental and human factors. The purpose of this course is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the causes and effects of global hunger and analyze threats to global food security including the climate crisis, environmental degradation, animal and plant diseases, access to clean water, food waste and loss, contaminated food, agricultural terrorism, and antimicrobial resistance. The current intensifying climate crisis, the Russian Invasion of the Ukraine, and the continuing COVID Pandemic have exacerbated the global food security crisis. This course will address food security, in terms of access to critical food supplies including major supply chain disruptions, and the nutritional impact on vulnerable food insecure populations at a global and national level. We will address food security related national and global health, economic, social, and ethical impacts of these disruptive forces. We will also examine strategies for protecting and enhancing the security of global food production and supply systems. In the final analysis, our goal is to gain insight into the interrelationship between food security and national security and develop an understanding of policies and programs necessary to achieve sustainable food security that is environmentally appropriate to ensure availability, access, utilization, and stability of adequate nutritious food for all people at all times.\n\nSocial Media & Culture\n\nMatthew West: Section 004 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nWhat is Social Media? We all use it, some of you will even “code” the next platforms, but to what extent do we really “get” it? How has social media changed the cultures that we live in and what are the consequences of these changes? Contemporary “real” life has now long been immersed in digital culture: our politics, our social and love lives, and our views of ourselves are all caught up in mobile, networked, visual, and even cyborg cultures. This course leads students to explore the many ways in which social media interactions are a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st century. The course is arranged around a series of readings and watchings, lectures introducing scholarly tools for understanding them and for sparking discussions, and a set of projects that lead students to get their hands dirty, experiencing and analyzing the real “e-world” of social media. This semester we will delve into topics including online dating, political movements, gaming culture, “internet addiction,” truth online, surveillance, and social activism. Throughout the course, we will be focused also on the ways that inequalities and power relations are changed by and are enacted through a variety of new “social” tools of cyberspace. The course welcomes HNRS affiliated students from all majors: from anthropology to humanities, fine arts, and social sciences students and from computer science and engineering students to those from other sciences backgrounds.\n\nResponses to Climate Change\n\nRichard Stafford: Section 005 - TR 12pm-1:15pm\n\nHow are we responding to climate change? What responses are we planning? How might we respond in the future? Who is this \"we\" anyway? The answers to these questions are vital: climate change is reshaping patterns of migration, impacting human health, changing the availability and cost of necessities like water and food, increasing the frequency or severity of natural disasters, causing sea-level rise and coastal flooding, and more. These impacts are projected to intensify in the coming years. However, because many of the activities that contribute most to climate change are deeply interwoven with our cultures, political systems, and economies, action is complicated and fraught. In this class, we will read about and discuss a range of different kinds of responses to climate change, how groups and institutions can be mobilized to respond, and what causes inaction.\n\nClimate Change for Humans\n\nAmy Rose-Tejwani: Section 006 - M 4:30pm-7:10pm and Section 007 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis course will examine the effects of climate change on our everyday lives and develop strategies for coping with severe weather and health concerns from climate change through the mindset of “thinking globally and acting locally.” We will investigate topics such as environmental policy, sustainability, aerosols, radiation, spectroscopy, and satellite imagery from the perspectives of humanities, technology, engineering, and science. Students will learn strategies for critical multidisciplinary analysis of meteorological events, climatic trends, reducing their carbon footprints, and effective science communication. With respect to the earth systems of the biosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere, this course will focus on climate change in our atmosphere.\n\nHNRS 240 Reading the Past\n\nMemory, Narrative, and Natural Disaster\n\nAndy Hoefer: Section 001 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nWhat do we mean when we describe a catastrophe as a “natural disaster”? How much of what happens before, during, and after these events is about the weather, and how much is a consequence of human decisions and actions – things like public policy, economic structures, infrastucture and engineering innovations, agricultural practices, and broad values and social norms? How do communities come together to survive, and who gets left behind? What stories do we tell in order to make sense of the chaotic, incoherent, and devasting experiences of these events? In this course, we’ll consider these questions and look closely at three major disasters from the last hundred years of US history: the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Dust Bowl, and Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. Our texts will include works of popular history, archived artifacts and documents from these periods, and relevant works of imaginative literature, visual art, and music. Collaborative inquiry will be essential throughout the semester, and students will have opportunities to dive deeply into specific topics and questions of their choosing.\n\nHistory of the Family\n\nSpencer Crew: Section 002 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThe definition of family and the role of each member has evolved over the years. Often the changes are related to economic circumstances and the social beliefs of the society. This course will primarily examine the way the American family has changed since colonial days. In the process, we will study how the responsibilities of women, children, and men have evolved and why. In addition, we will learn how oral history can aid in researching family history.\n\nSlavery & Freedom in Virginia\n\nSheri Huerta: Section 003 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nWhat is freedom and how do we use the past to create a narrative of what American freedom means? This course tackles the complex questions of what freedoms like movement, residency, bodily control, and family meant in an era of enslavement (1619-1865); how the boundaries between freedom and enslavement were created, policed, negotiated, transgressed, and challenged; and how these stories impact our present understanding of American freedom(s). To do this, we will uncover stories of the people most often marginalized and silenced by history and follow their journeys across the Atlantic Ocean, into sites of enslavement, within legislative debates about freedom, along the Underground Railroad, and into local courthouses as they sought to make claims to freedom and define its meaning. We will discuss how stories of resistance and resilience during the era of enslavement have been represented in public history and then work towards social justice by designing a memorial in teams to amplify the marginalized or silenced voices of people who help us better understand the meanings of freedom and enslavement in Virginia.\n\nFree Speech and Censorship\n\nSamuel Lebovic: Section 004 - MW 12pm-1:15pm\n\nWhat do we have the right to say? Can censorship ever be justified? This course explores the changing ways that Americans have answered these questions in the past, in order to better understand how we should think about the right to free speech in our current moment. We will read broadly in the law, philosophy and politics of free speech over the course of the nation’s history, examining such subjects as political radicalism, hate speech, obscenity, criminal incitement, fake news, and defamation. Particular attention will be paid to analyzing the development of First Amendment law, to studying the history of some famous, controversial cases, and to thinking about the role that free expression should play in U.S. democracy.\n\nHistory of AI\n\nJan Allbeck: Section 005 - MW 9am-10:15am\n\nIn this course, we will explore the history of artificial intelligence and its impact. We will trace the evolution of key technologies and how they have changed the way that we live. We will also discuss potential future technologies and the impact that they might have on society.\n\nHNRS 260 Society and Community Engagement\n\nPublic Participation in Environmental Governance\n\nJulie Minde: Section 001 - W 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis course introduces the topic of how members of the public take part in activities associated with government implementation of environmental policy, regulation, and management. Important questions include, but are not limited to: When, how and why do citizens participate in activities related to government management of natural resources, stewardship of the environment, planning and preparation for environmental disasters, and environmental risk assessment? What are the dynamics between governments and their publics, and how do these dynamics shape environmental governance processes and outcomes? Are there more effective, equitable, and efficient ways to engage citizens and communities in environmental governance? Such questions are becoming more critical in a world marked by uncertainty and rapid environmental change as well as political fluctuation. We will investigate these and related questions through activities such as: literature review, case study analysis, role-playing and simulation, and model development.\n\nRedesigning College\n\nKathleen deLaski: Section 002 - M 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis course will teach students a set of design tools to research, prototype and test their new ideas for fixing what’s wrong with college. We will use “redesigning college,” a close-to-home issue, as our prime case study, but students will also have a chance to apply the skills to other social issues that are important to them, whether it’s global warming, mental health or parking access on campus. The design methodology is called “design thinking” or “human-centered design.” We will use these tools to step inside the lives of students, faculty and employers to analyze barriers and unmet needs. We will ideate solution sets and “design criteria.” We will hone the skills of “rapid prototyping” and “guerilla testing” and build pilot plans to present to the administration. We will address the challenge that 70% of career-entry jobs require a bachelor’s degree, yet most American adults, 62%, do not possess a four-year degree. Can “college” and the path to meaningful work be reimagined to address exclusivity, access, cost, racial equity and flexibility to break the cycle of poverty in families with no college degree experience? Students will meet practitioners in this fast-moving field who are driving change and they will have a chance to bring their best bets to life. This is also a great course to understand the changing ways that employers are hiring entry level talent and to understand and present your own skills on your resume and beyond.\n\nThriving in Organizations: Being a Successful Employee in Today's Organizations\n\nKevin Rockmann: Section 003 - M 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nMost of you will at some point in your life work in an organization. Whether small, medium, large, non-profit, governmental, family-owned, etc-organizations form the backbone of our society and as such employ almost every worker. Where do we learn though how to think about organizations, examine organizations, and succeed as organizational members? Here! In this practicum course you will be visiting several organizations to train yourselves to be thoughtful observers of culture, processes, and relationships, with the goal of helping you succeed and thrive in your future organizational lives.\n\nSocial Justice Philanthropy\n\nValentino Bryant: Section 004 - TR 12pm-1:15pm\n\nThe serious philanthropist must think and work strategically —building a deep understanding of the specific social issues of interest and community context and dynamics, identifying the highest potential leverage points and relevant resources, building relationships with a range of stakeholders, and negotiating the intersections between donor interests and community need, balancing innovation and experience, understanding legal issues, creating a robust investment strategy with clear goals and aligned actions, considering long-term exit strategies, designing and implementing impact evaluations, assessing potential partner organizations and plans, and monitoring and supporting grantee organizations. This course will engage students in the conceptual frameworks and research regarding philanthropy, social change, organizational dynamics, and concrete practice in designing and implementing a philanthropic strategy.\n\nRefugees, Borders & Migration\n\nSophia Balakian: Section 005 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nWhat is the nature of borders at the dawn of the new millennium? What are the effects of borders on human life on the planet – for individuals, families, and communities? We live in a world of greater global interconnectivity than ever before, and simultaneously, border walls, fences, offshore migrant detention centers, refugee camps, and “smart borders” employing new technologies, contain and separate. Forces such as the global economy, military interventions, civil and international conflicts, and the destruction of environments and livelihoods due to worsening climate change, propel people from their homes in mass numbers. News headlines, images, and popular discourses typically take national borders themselves at face value. Instead, we might ask, What is a border? When and how did states begin controlling human movement? How do borders come to bear on the lives of real people and communities? In this course, we examine how race, class, gender, kinship, and colonial histories shape migration today. We study critical writings about migration, borders, and citizenship; and how people trying to cross borders interact with border policies, technologies, and their often-deadly violence. The course focuses on case studies from across the world, while also considering borders and migration through global frameworks. We read, view, and listen to works that foreground ethnography, history, social theory, as well as first-person narratives that center the voices of people on the move.\n\nGlobal Issues in Tourism and International Mobility\n\nMinkyung Park: Section 006 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nTourism is a multi-faceted phenomenon that involves economic, cultural, social, and environmental discourses. Tourism is also a third largest export category in the world that significantly contributes to the world economy. This course examines tourism as a global industry and human activity that promotes and facilitates understanding of historical, cultural, and social values, and of international trends that showcase global issues faced by the global society. Topics include tourism in relation to experience economy, sharing economy, social media, touristification, overtourism, ESG, DEI, Fair Tourism, Carbon Neutral Tourism, AI and Digital Technology.\n\nHome, Housing and Belonging\n\nSupriya Baily: Section 007 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThe place that we live is a complex idea enmeshed in identity, politics, culture, economics and a myriad of other interrelated issues. In this course, we will explore these intersections, across time, place and space, to better understand how home, housing and belonging are intertwined, taking a very personal issue into very public spaces. We will explore what it means to create a home in challenging circumstances. We will deconstruct how housing has always been a contested issue. And we will debate what belonging means when one’s understanding of home is challenged. Taking a global view, we will look at the politics of immigration, colonization, land-ownership, citizenship, nationalism and patriarchy as it relates to the creation of home and the rules that we exist under to be able to live as cohesive communities. The course will draw from current events, policy and global practices to help students better navigate what it means when we say “home is where the heart is.\"\n\nColonialism, Knowledge & Power\n\nSausan Ghosheh: Section 008 - R 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis course explores the intricate relationship between colonialism, knowledge, and power and their impact on our understanding of the world and our place in it. It examines the various facets of colonialism, utilizing a range of academic disciplines to analyze the power dynamics inherent in colonialism, explore resistance to colonial domination, investigate how notions of race and culture were shaped by imperial encounters, and scrutinize the impact of colonialism on peace and justice. The course also introduces students to diverse methodologies for studying colonialism, encourages them to challenge and decenter the dominance of Western/Eurocentric frameworks, and sheds light on marginalized perspectives and practices. The course fosters critical thinking, prompts students to question prevailing narratives, and encourages meaningful conversations about global justice, social equity, and the ongoing struggle for a more inclusive and just world.\n\nCoastal Conflict & Resilience\n\nKristin Weis: Section DL1 - R 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nCoastal communities around the world face unique challenges due to the impacts of climate change, resource use, and increasing population density. This course will explore how coastal communities can navigate these challenges and related conflicts. From local disputes to geopolitical dynamics, students will analyze case studies of coastal conflicts and their political, economic, social, and ecological factors. Students will also study key concepts and strategies to increase resilience, including stakeholder engagement, resource management, and coastal adaptation and protection methods. The course will emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from environmental science, conflict studies, international affairs, political science, economics, anthropology, and other fields. Students will be able to experiment with real-world assessment tools, create custom strategies, practice stakeholder negotiation, and engage in regular class discussions.\n\nHNRS 261 Community Connection Practicum\n\nPeer Mentorship in Honors\n\nNadeen Makhlouf: Section 001 - F 10:30am-1:10pm\n\nPeer Mentorship in Honors is a service-based learning practicum to train Honors College Peer Mentors (PMs). PMs engage in the Honors College Community by mentoring first-semester students taking HNRS 110: Principles of Research and Inquiry. HNRS 261 students must be available to attend one section of HNRS 110 in addition to HNRS 261 in order to serve as a mentor. In addition to providing mentorship, PMs foster a sense of community and are actively engaged in the ongoing process of articulating what “service,” “civic engagement” and “collaborative learning” mean in the context of the Honors College Curriculum. Students who successfully complete HNRS 261 are eligible to take HNRS 361 \"Peer Leadership in Honors\" in Spring or Fall 2025.\n\nHonors College Connects\n\nMelanie Fedri: Section 002 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nIn Honors College Connects, students contribute to the work of local nonprofits addressing health, social justice, environmental, and other challenges. Students work in multi-disciplinary teams and are mentored by student alums of the program. Through Honors College Connects, students build professional skills while making a real impact in the community beyond Mason. Over the past 12 years, 325 Honors College students have contributed to the work of 60 nonprofits. Through Honors College Connects, Honors College students like you have an opportunity to advance the work of diversely led and diversely serving community organizations. In addition, for those looking for leadership opportunities, Honors College Connects runs on a strong student leadership model, with paid student officers and mentors, along with a volunteer Partner and Alumni Council.\n\nHNRS 360 Multi-Disciplinary Topics\n\nAI and Human Values\n\nDean Taciuch: Section 001 - TR 10:30am-11:45am and Section 002 - TR 12pm-1:15pm\n\nThe quest for artificial intelligence has led to many types of “narrow AI,” most of which are better than humans at their specific skills (from playing games to predicting the structure of a protein). But the goal for much AI research is Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. A narrow AI can drive a car, for example, but it can’t play chess, or answer a trivia question. An AGI could. Much of the in AI scholarship has been on the risks of AI development: misaligned values, ethical dilemmas, economic concerns. But the rewards are immense: longer, healthier lives, more stable governments, more equitable societies, a cleaner environment, and the exploration of our universe. This course will explore current and future ethical questions of AI development, including questions of human values and identity.\n\nThe Future of Higher Education\n\nSharon Doetsch-Kidder: Section 003 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nThe role of universities as tools of equity and social mobility was diminishing along with government funding when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The pandemic laid bare to many the uncertainty that was always already part of our lives and particularly our institutions and exacerbated what was already recognized by many as a mental health crisis among all ages in the U.S. In 2020, people at a large number of institutions were able to make rapid changes in pedagogies, policies, and modes of work, despite previous resistance. Many of these changes increased accessibility to some, while broader political and economic changes made it more difficult for low-income students to enroll and succeed in higher education. Student success and completion have also been negatively impacted by increasing mental health challenges, which continue even as universities work to “get back to normal” and proceed, often with reduced enrollments, reduced government funding, and, in some states, increasing restrictions on faculty and institutions. In this class, we will explore some of the current challenges facing universities and consider what practices and policies should be preserved, what should be left behind, and how we can transform higher education for a world filled with growing inequalities and unprecedented global crises. We will explore questions such as: • What is the purpose of higher education? • What roles could/should universities play in society? • Who belongs in higher education? • What should we teach? • How should we teach? • Who should pay for higher education? • What role should technology play in education? • What do we want/hope for the future of higher education? Through our exploration of current issues in higher education, students will: 1. Using multidisciplinary perspectives, connect issues in higher education to wider intellectual, community or societal concerns 2. Apply critical thinking skills to evaluate the quality, credibility and limitations of an argument or a solution using appropriate evidence or resources 3. Apply critical thinking skills judge the quality or value of an idea, work, method or principle based on appropriate analytics and standards 4. Develop communicative skills to actively listen and productively engage with others in various and appropriate modalities 5. Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives\n\nDevelopment of Modern Science\n\nJames Trefil: Section 004 - M 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThe course covers the development of science from the earliest times to 1900. It covers Egyptian, Greek, Islamic, and European scientific developments. No previous scientific knowledge is required. The course emphasizes group research projects and communication skills. This course has an irregular meeting pattern—some sessions are scheduled in person and some are synchronous online. Students are expected to participate in both modalities. Exams and presentations are conducted in-person, as designated in the course syllabus. Please see Patriot Web for the exact class meeting schedule.\n\nMultimedia Storytelling\n\nBrenna Maloney: Section 005 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nStudents examine and practice methods for reporting nonfiction stories using a combination of text, images, sound, video and graphics. The course highlights a multimedia approach to journalism, yet the content is appropriate for non-journalism students who wish to expand their multimedia storytelling knowledge.\n\nGlobal Social Thought\n\nLester Kurtz: Section 006 - W 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nGlobal Social Thought investigates alternatives to classical Western social theory, exploring classical and contemporary Nonwestern, non-white scholarship. It is a postcolonial effort to remedy the deep racism of our knowledge, which is so profoundly influenced by the Euro-American experience, to the neglect of other significant streams of social theory over the millennia and across the globe, with a focus on South Asian, East Asian, African, Islamic, and Indigenous American thought.\n\nOpera as Social Action: The Case of \"Loving v. Virginia\"\n\nRichard Davis: Section 007 - R 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nIn a landmark 1967 decision, the United States Supreme Court struck down laws in Virginia and 15 other states banning interracial marriage, based on a case brought by Mildred and Peter Loving, whose 1958 marriage led to their arrest and banishment from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Now, Virginia Opera has commissioned a new operatic treatment of the case, with music by Damien Geter and libretto by Jessica Murphy Moo, directed by Denyce Graves. This course will examine the social, cultural, and legal contexts of the case in parallel with an exploration of the developmental process of this new opera, including interactions with members of the creative and production team. The course will also examine the role of opera as an art form in responding to or seeking to shape social issues throughout history. Students will do original research to help create \"public dramaturgy\" materials in support of the opera's premiere performances at Mason next May, 2025.\n\nThe Politics of PTSD\n\nClaudia Rector: Section DL1 - TR 9am-10:15am\n\nMental disorder has always been a phenomenon subject to politics and rhetoric, as changing ideas of normalcy and deviance prove. In this course, we will examine the conceptual frameworks and rhetoric around the diagnosis, treatment, and experience of mental disorder in the U.S., specifically the politics of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), stress and trauma, and their differentiation from other forms of mental disorder. We will examine the history of the diagnostic category of PTSD, including the conceptual frameworks and rhetoric that shaped its evolution. We will consider how the individual experience of trauma is related to the individual’s relationship with the community, and consider what that might imply for both the ways that individuals are helped and the ways that the community regards their experiences. After examining the development of the diagnosis of PTSD in context, we will consider two other situations where trauma and PTSD have been identified—within fundamentalist Christianity, and around mass shootings—to examine the politics of trauma, including whose suffering is acknowledged and the community responses to that.\n\nHNRS 361 Multidisciplinary Practicum\n\nLead Mentorship in Honors\n\nJohn Woolsey: Section 001 - F 10:30am-1:10pm\n\nThis section of HNRS 361 is a project- and service-based learning practicum. Students work on collaborative projects aimed at creating a wider sense of belonging, engagement and inclusion for Honors College students. Students serve as Peer Mentors to HNRS 110 students, fostering a positive sense of community and facilitating the ongoing process of articulating what “mentorship,” “service,” “civic engagement” and “collaborative learning” mean in the context of the Honors College curriculum. Approval required for registration: please contact Dr. Woolsey.\n\nHonors College Consults\n\nMelanie Fedri: Section 002 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nStudents in this course will work in multidisciplinary teams to design a solution to a challenge or problem offered by Mason’s partners from the Northern Virginia business and government communities. Students will be supported in this project by a faculty instructor and a mentor from the participating partner. They will have opportunities to synthesize the knowledge and practices they have developed over the course of their undergraduate experience, to develop the skills and strategies necessary for working effectively in multidisciplinary teams, and to apply all of this as they work to solve a problem or challenge in a professional environment. Work on the project will culminate with the public presentation of the team’s proposed solution, as well as a final report to be delivered to the partner.\n\nHNRS 499 Special Topics\n\nHonoring Our Community\n\nSam Steen: Section 1 - R 3pm-4:15pm and Section 2 - F 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThis course is a part of the Honoring Our Community Fellowship Program. The application for next year has not yet opened. Watch the Honors College newsletter for more information.\n\nSummer 2024\n\nHNRS 122 Reading the Arts\n\nDocumentary Photography and Film\n\nCaroline West: Summer Session C MTWR 10:30am-12:35pm\n\nHow do we define documentary? How do we differentiate between documentary, fiction, and entertainment? In this class, we will examine these questions, thinking about the special expectations we have for documentary photography and film: to tell us the truth. We’ll approach the work through essential questions about authenticity, representation, voice, authorship, form, and politics by exploring the historical and social contexts in our examination of a broad range of documentary work. Our explorations, and the readings that support them, will be both theoretical and empirical. Throughout the semester, we will be conscious of the way that documentaries deal with questions of what is truth/reality, and the ethical issues involved in photographing and filming real people.\n\nHNRS 261 Community Connection Practicum\n\nPeer Mentorship in Honors\n\nNadeen Makhlouf: Summer Session C TWR 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nDo you like working with others, supporting your community, and getting course credit while doing so?

HNRS 261 students will engage with high school students and soon to be first-generation college students enrolled in the Early Identification Program and train to be Honors College Peer Mentors. In addition to fostering a positive sense of community, students will explore definitions of “mentorship,” “service,” “civic engagement” and “collaborative learning” in the context of higher education. Students who complete HNRS 261 this summer are eligible to enroll in HNRS 361: Lead Mentorship in Honors for Fall 2024.\n\nContact Dr. Makhlouf for permission to enroll.\n\nHNRS 361 Multidisciplinary Practicum\n\nPeer Leadership in Honors\n\nNadeen Makhlouf: Summer Session C TWR 9:30am - 12:30pm\n\nDo you like working with others, supporting your community, and getting course credit while doing so? Have you already completed HNRS 260 or 261? Then you should consider enrolling in HNRS 361: Lead Mentorship in Honors this summer. This section of HNRS 361 is a service-based learning practicum. HNRS 361 students will work alongside peers to practice their leadership skills, engage with high school students enrolled in the Early Identification Program and train to be Honors College Peer Mentors. In addition to fostering a positive sense of community, students will explore definitions of “mentorship,” “service,” “civic engagement” and “collaborative learning” in the context of higher education. Students who complete HNRS 361 this summer are eligible to apply to be Lead Mentors for Fall 2024. This section is especially recommended for students who have previously taken the Peer Mentorship in Honors or College Application Coaches sections of HNRS 261.\n\nContact Dr. Makhlouf for permission to enroll.\n\nSpring 2024\n\nHNRS 122 Reading the Arts\n\nThe Dutch \"Golden Age\"\n\nAngela Ho: Section 001 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nThe seventeenth century has long been regarded as the “Golden Age” of Dutch art. The Dutch developed a booming, sophisticated art market, creating an environment in which new genres such as still life, landscape, and scenes of contemporary life, flourished. This course explores how the creations of Rembrandt, Vermeer, and their less well-known but equally interesting peers were shaped by—and shaped—Dutch culture and society. Within decades of its emergence as an independent state at the turn of the seventeenth century, the Dutch Republic rose to the position of a great economic and colonial power in Europe. We will situate Dutch images within this historical context and investigate the intricate links between art, commerce, colonialism, politics, and science. We will also consider how Dutch art is marketed to today’s audience in the form of blockbuster museum exhibitions as well as popular novels and movies. By participating in class discussions and completing the course assignments, students will develop important academic skills such as visual analysis, critical reading, and evidence-based reasoning.\n\nYoung Adult Literature in a Contemporary Context\n\nMichael Hock: Section 002 - TR 9am-10:15am\n\nYoung Adult Literature as a concept has been around for years, but the classification is new. Why is it important, and why is it worth analyzing? In this class we'll take a look at contemporary young adult novels and explore how they can fit into the literary canon and \"classics\". We'll also look into the concept of literature itself as it's presented in our modern age, as we explore podcasts, digital short stories, and webcomics. Class discussions include on the importance of all literature, how social media has allowed us new access to authors, and just what we should consider literature in the 21st century.\n\nVisual Media and the Environment\n\nCaroline West: Section 003 - MW 12pm-1:15pm\n\nThis course asks how environmental issues are represented in various visual media, including films, photographs, art, and performance as well as digital visualizations, maps, and VR. Most of our experience and communication take place within spaces of media so students will be asked to think critically about the many relationships between media and the environmental issues. We will explore visual media from the perspective of different ecological problems and the communities effected to consider how visual media are part and parcel to understanding environmental change.\n\nPhotography and Culture\n\nCaroline West: Section 004 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nThis course will examine how photography has participated in and shaped our understanding key social and political issues in society. We will explore photography through its multiple functions in our social world by paying particular attention to critiques and analysis of photographs within historical and cultural contexts: how they are to be understood and interpreted; whether they have clear-cut content and meanings; how they shape and are shaped by politics, economics, and social life.\n\nVisual Culture and (Cosmic) Horror\n\nCollin Hawley: Section 005 - MW 9am-10:15am and Section 006 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nHorror is a genre that presents the unrepresentable: the taboo, the horrible, the inexplicable. Cosmic horror specifically, a style popularized by the writer H.P. Lovecraft, employs sanity-stretching narratives to de-center humanity from its supposed central place in the hierarchy of nature. This course will examine how the growing popularity of cosmic horror themes reconstruct the discourse of how we understand the position of humanity in opposition to threats from “the outside.”\n\nReading Moving Images\n\nWilliam Beaman: Section 007 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm and Section 008 - MW 3pm-4:15pm\n\nIs meaning in the eyes of the beholder? If so, how do we read what we see? This course develops scholarly techniques for reading films as ambiguous social texts, always in excess of the any preferred meaning, yet inescapably of our world. Moving through selections from global film history, we will explore and historicize how cinematic forms make meaning in our lives.\n\nCreative Nonfiction: The story of YOU!\n\nAimee Weinstein: Section 009 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nWhat does it mean to tell your story? How does an ordinary person put together descriptions, thoughts and reflections to create a work that is truly extraordinary? This course will focus on the definition of creative nonfiction as separate from journalism, essays or other works of nonfiction that are less biographical and creative. Our end goal is to create something ourselves that is read-worthy by someone other than our mothers and to imagine ourselves as authors of the story of our lives. We will explore how writers do not only tell their stories – as in WHAT happened – but also the ways they reflect on their snippet of reality, how they make sense of the experiences and how they bring those experiences to life for the reader. How do they succeed in making their regular lives vivid and interesting to an outside reader?\n\nHNRS 130 Identity, Community, Difference\n\nExperiencing Difference\n\nLisa Sechrest-Ehrhardt : Section 001 - MW 10:30am-11:45am and Section 002 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nDiversity in the United States provides a rich, yet complicated environment regarding social interaction among people from varying racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. Different world perspectives affect behavior in social interactions and can have positive and or negative consequences. How does a person’s race, ethnicity, or gender affect his or her interactions with others? Students will be introduced to Social Interaction Theory and Cognitive Theory which provide a robust foundation for navigating diverse social interactions. Using inquiry and collaborative learning processes students will learn how these theories provide an understanding to what one “brings” to communications and exchanges with others. Students will examine the “intersectionality” of race, ethnicity, gender, ability, socioeconomic status, and age to comprehend the importance of self-awareness in the process of understanding self, others and community.\n\nMaking and Unmaking the Human\n\nRachel Jones : Section 003 - MW 3pm-4:15pm\n\nIn this class, we will consider the ways in which ‘the human’ has been historically produced in the modern Western world through concepts of race and gender, as well as through structuring contrasts between both self and Other, culture and nature, human and animal. We will also examine how these conceptual frameworks have been used to withhold the status of the human in colonial contexts. We will be accompanied in our investigations by ‘Animal,’ the main character in Indra Sinha’s novel, \"Animal’s People,\" set in the aftermath of the 1984 Bhopal disaster. We will undertake a close read of this book alongside a variety of theoretical sources drawn from philosophy, postcolonial studies, the ecological humanities, disability theory, philosophy of race, and gender and sexuality studies. By doing so, we will explore the multiple ways in which the human can be made, un-made, and re-imagined.\n\nJudaism and Social Justice\n\nBruce Aft : Section 004 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nFacing the challenges of living in a world where we are concerned about public safety, refugees, mental health, and the consequences of a pandemic, we will join together and search for meaningful ways to repair our world. We will examine racism, antisemitism, other isms. homophobia, gender fluidity, food insecurity and our biases. We also will set our agenda based upon the interests of the students who register. Judaism has much to teach us about how faith and morality can provide inspiration as we pursue justice in our world.\n\nDesign Studio: Big Ideas as a Lens for Design\n\nTheodore Prawat : Section 005 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nEvery design starts with a spark of an idea, and the designer works to solve a problem that we didn’t even know existed. Great designs can be subtle, seamless, bold, epic or even whimsical. This course uses design studies to unpack how these designs are intricately constructed. This course is project based, hand’s on, and encourages a process of discovery and imagination. Students in this course will actively engage design ideas through educational game design, art, music, architecture, and other significant cultural productions. Students will be able to think critically and reflect upon how these designs became cultural landmarks. Emulating a working design studio, we will use a variety of tools such as AI, AR, and the Unity 3D game engine, and even robot design to address specific problems based on real life design case studies.\n\nMasculinity and Music\n\nAmanda Bryan : Section 006 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThis course focuses on how masculinity is socially constructed through music and various musical genres. By reading contemporary musical compositions as texts, we will examine how a plurality of communities defined as masculine are developed, articulated, reinforced, and practiced. We will consider how difference is viewed, treated, and at times encouraged in various masculine communities. We will consider the various masculine roles, traditionally and non-traditionally, held by those identifying as masculine. Course assessments will incorporate world music explorations, guiding discussions, writing guided text responses, closely reading and analyzing texts, building case studies, presenting on case studies, and regular student engagement. (This course is not taught by a music instructor and will not focus on music theory or compositional techniques. No musical skill is necessary for success in this course.)\n\nIntersecting Identities\n\nAziza Ahmed : Section 007 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm and Section 008 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nIn this course, students will be given the tools and skills to engage with intersectional identities both interpersonally and professionally. We will begin the course by establishing a common language and practice for discussing and engaging with intersectional identities. Then, we will use mass media such as television, podcasts, and digital media to investigate how intersectionality takes shape in our contemporary society. Topics include gender, caste, sex, race, ethnicity, class, religion, disability, sexuality, and more.\n\nMemory, Art, and Identity\n\nLuma Mousa : Section 009 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm and Section 010 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nIdentity is the way we understand and express ourselves. Circumstances that we are born with usually influence defining one's identity, decision-making, building friendships, aligning with certain political beliefs, and many more. Yet, various aspects of identity change with experiences, and social interactions with others. Memory, storytelling, and art are all forms to express, explore, and question notions about identity. This course considers memory, art, and narrative identity. Throughout the course, we will study how memory and art contribute to shaping identity and the essence of home for immigrants, refugees, and everyone who is away from their home, lost it, or is at risk of losing it. Concepts like race, class, gender, intersectionality, nationality, ethnicity, diversity, and multiculturalism will be a foundational part of discussing, identifying, and explaining the contextual, historical, and nature of identity, community, and difference. Essential questions, such as: what is the role of remembering and the influence of memorialization on identity? How is collective memory shaped through art production? How do memories affect who we are and why they are important? How does art address the difficulties of fitting in society? will be thoroughly discussed during the course.\n\nResolving Identity Conflict\n\nToni Farris : Section 011 - MW 9am-10:15am and Section 012 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThis course pursues focused questions about how different conceptions of identity, community and difference are articulated and practiced in specific social and historical contexts. Students will explore how questions about individuality and subjectivity are asked in the humanities, arts, and/or social sciences. Identity can be the glue that holds communities together or the catalyst for protracted conflict. This course will explore the role of identity in individual and group conflict dynamics by presenting foundational theories and transformational practices. We will pay particular attention to how identities inform the way we view ourselves and others, as well as how we interpret the world around us. Our study will utilize an interdisciplinary approach that includes analysis of psychosocial, anthropological, political, and conflict resolution theories that can enhance social responsibility and efforts towards peace.\n\nThinking Through Identity\n\nAlison Landsberg : Section 013 - TR 9am-10:15am\n\nWhat make us who we are? Is identity grounded in the psyche? Is identity “natural”? Does it have a biological basis? Is it manifested on the body? Or is identity externally imposed by the social world we inhabit? Do one's memories shape one's identity? How free are individuals to invent themselves, to change their identities, and what limits such attempts? To answer these questions, this course will explore various philosophical, psychological, sociological, and historical conceptions of self. We will consider aspects of identity such as race, gender, sexuality, nationality, and class. We will also assess the impact of the internet on conceptions of the self. Analyzing a broad range of fictional, theoretical/philosophical and autobiographical texts, we will consider how the self is constructed, and both the potential for, and limits on, personal transformation.\n\nDisability, Health and Illness\n\nClaudia Rector : Section DL1 - TR 9am-10:15am and Section DL2 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThis course considers how identity intersects with the body, specifically with disability, health and illness. We will examine how identity in the contemporary U.S. is shaped by physical difference, and consider what possibilities are created or foreclosed by various imaginings of both identity and disability. Specific topics to be considered include (among others): eugenics, the medical model of disability and the disability rights response, chronic illness, Deaf culture, abortion, mental health/illness, disability studies, non-violent resistance, and COVID.\n\nHNRS 131 Contemporary Social Issues\n\nK-12 Education Policy\n\nAmy Crockett : Section 001 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\nThis course explores the various social and economic issues within K-12 education. We will examine the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, culture, and other forms of identity impact various educational issues. Students will consider the different approaches to understanding different policy debates as well as understand the different stakeholder views. Some of the issues to be considered are purpose of school, school admissions tests, inequities of school funding, school access, impact of charter schools and private schools, and the school to prison pipeline. The course will provide students with the opportunity to think through the challenges with creating and designing public policy to address various education issues. Students will also consider the issues from a wide range of perspectives. The goal of the class is to prepare students to understand and engage in the contemporary debates around these issues.\n\nClimate Change for Humans\n\nAmy Rose-Tejwani : Section 002 - M 4:30pm-7:10pm and Section 003 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis course will examine the effects of climate change on our everyday lives and develop strategies for coping with severe weather and health concerns from climate change through the mindset of “thinking globally and acting locally.” We will investigate topics such as environmental policy, sustainability, aerosols, radiation, spectroscopy, and satellite imagery from the perspectives of humanities, technology, engineering, and science. Students will learn strategies for critical multidisciplinary analysis of meteorological events, climatic trends, reducing their carbon footprints, and effective science communication. With respect to the earth systems of the biosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere, this course will focus on climate change in our atmosphere.\n\nEliminating Global Hunger: Problems, Progress, and Challenges\n\nPhillip Thomas : Section 004 - MW 12pm-1:15pm\n\nGlobal hunger is one of the most critical problems confronting the global community in the 21st Century. Despite numerous efforts over the past 50 years its elimination remains elusive due to a complex array of environmental and human factors. The purpose of this course is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the causes and effects of global hunger and analyze threats to global food security including the climate crisis, environmental degradation, animal and plant diseases, access to clean water, food waste and loss, contaminated food, agricultural terrorism, and antimicrobial resistance. The current intensifying climate crisis, the Russian Invasion of the Ukraine, and the continuing COVID Pandemic have exacerbated the global food security crisis. This course will address food security, in terms of access to critical food supplies including major supply chain disruptions, and the nutritional impact on vulnerable food insecure populations at a global and national level. We will address food security related national and global health, economic, social, and ethical impacts of these disruptive forces. We will also examine strategies for protecting and enhancing the security of global food production and supply systems. In the final analysis, our goal is to gain insight into the interrelationship between food security and national security and develop an understanding of policies and programs necessary to achieve sustainable food security that is environmentally appropriate to ensure availability, access, utilization, and stability of adequate nutritious food for all people at all times.\n\nIntroduction to Nationalism\n\nMohammad Ehsan : Section 005 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm and Section 006 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nNationalism, by far the most powerful political ideology of the last two and a half centuries, has transformed the course of human history across the world. By presenting a new type of human identity, it has both emancipated and enslaved, constructed and destroyed. It persisted in portraying itself as a natural component of human existence. Therefore, the study of nationalism is an exercise in self-exploration. Even though nationalism has characterized the modern era, there is significant dispute over its most essential concepts. There are numerous forms of nationalism. It can present itself through civic, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, religious, or ideological traits. The goal of this course, \"Introduction to Nationalism,\" is to offer students with a thorough and critical analysis of the main nationalist ideologies and examples from across several continents in order to grasp both their claims and historical contexts.\n\nHNRS 240 Reading the Past\n\nHistory of AI\n\nJan Allbeck: Section 001 - MW 9am-10:15am\n\n\" In this course, we will explore the history of artificial intelligence and its impact. We will trace the evolution of key technologies and how they have changed the way that we live. We will also discuss potential future technologies and the impact that they might have on society. \"\n\nSlavery & Freedom in Virginia\n\nSheri Huerta: Section 002 - MW 12pm-1:15pm and Section 003 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\n\"What is freedom and how do we use the past to create a narrative of what American freedom means? This course tackles the complex questions of what freedoms like movement, residency, bodily control, and family meant in an era of enslavement (1619-1865) and the enduring legacies of racism and racist policies. We will investigate how the boundaries between freedom and enslavement were created, policed, negotiated, transgressed, and challenged in Virginia and identify how these stories impact our present understanding of American freedom(s). To do this, we will uncover stories of the people most often marginalized and silenced by history and follow their journeys across the Atlantic Ocean, into sites of enslavement, within legislative debates about freedom, along the Underground Railroad, and into local courthouses as they sought to make claims to freedom and challenge racial oppression. We will identify links between past injustices and present situations. We will discuss how stories of resistance and resilience during the era of enslavement have been represented in public history and work towards social justice by designing, in teams, public history projects that create more inclusive narratives. \"\n\nEarly Woman's Movement\n\nLisa Gring-Pemble: Section 004 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\n\" In an age where we all have easy access to electronic media and can make use of multiple platforms to share our ideas, it is inconceivable that women at one point in our history did not have the “right” to speak in public. But, at the beginning of the 19th century, public advocacy of any sort was considered outside of women’s proper sphere. How women claimed their voice and succeeded in leading major social and political reforms, is a powerful and important story. Recalling the successes of the early woman’s movement, Lucy Stone once remarked “I think with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their right to free speech and to speak at all in public has been earned.” In this learning community, we will explore the roots of the early woman’s movement as a case study to understand social change. We will get to know extraordinary women, analyze influential primary texts, and learn about social movement theory as we investigate the obstacles, dilemmas, and successes of the 19th century woman’s movement. \"\n\nU.S. Colleges and Universities\n\nBlake Silver: Section 005 - TR 1:30pm-2:45pm\n\n\"U.S. colleges and universities have changed in notable ways over the years, but inequality in student access and experiences remains an enduring feature. This course explores sociological perspectives on the history of U.S. higher education with a focus on examining the evolving forms of inequality in colleges and universities and placing contemporary postsecondary institutions in historical context. Sociological perspectives on the past will be employed in analyzing primary and secondary sources in order to answer a number of questions about (a) the form and function of U.S. colleges and universities, (2) their societal impact, (3) their responsiveness to various social forces, and (4) the persistence of inequality in U.S. higher education.\"\n\nMass Culture Across Classes\n\nStephen Hickson: Section 006 - MW 9am-10:15am and Section 007 - MW 10:30am-11:45am\n\nTechnological innovations and enhanced time for leisure in the mid-nineteenth century facilitated the development of cultural forms, like photography, that were easily distributed to and accessible by the masses. Mass cultural forms, including photography, novels, films, radio, and television, further grew in scope and reach in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In this class, we will trace the historical creation and cultural development of mass forms and explore the relation of these forms to the history of labor movements and class struggles.\n\nHNRS 260 Society and Community Engagement\n\nPublic Service in Modern Society\n\nNadeen Makhlouf : Section 001 - MW 9am-10:15am\n\nThis course provides a broad overview of the field of public service and covers the history and development of the public sector, as well as how it serves contemporary society. Public service requires coordinating efforts both within and between different sectors of society whether it is the government, international organizations, community-based organizations, nonprofits, or citizens. Everyone, regardless of interest, should be cognizant of the tremendous influence of public administration, leaders, and administrators in shaping public life. Topics include an overview of public management, leadership, motivation, ethics, citizen engagement, innovation, collaboration, and social equity. Activities will include a variety of written assignments, in-class simulations, presentations, and other activities designed to prepare students for professional work in the field.\n\nAccess Issues in U.S. Education\n\nMaoria Kirker : Section 002 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nThis course will explore issues related to access in U.S. education. We will examine access through three lenses throughout the semester: historical, socioeconomic, and public policy. The first half of the class will focus on K-12 education while the second half will focus on higher education. The class is meant to be relevant to students in any major as there will be space to explore a topic of their own interest related to access, social justice, and U.S. education.\n\nSifting Through the Noise: Navigating the Disinformation Age\n\nDavid Lemmons : Section 003 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nInformation surrounds us: on social media, in conversations, and in our coursework. How do we navigate a world that is increasingly saturated with information? How do you know what’s true when everyone seems to disagree? In Sifting Through the Noise, students will learn how to engage with this environment of information overload. By learning to evaluate information, apply their lived experience to what they read, and learn about the context of how information is created, students will get the tools they need to make informed decisions and engage with the world around them. Students can expect a discussion-oriented course where they will engage with a variety of sources in a variety of formats.\n\nSpatializing (In)justice\n\nChristine Rosenfeld : Section 004 - TR 10:30am-11:45am\n\nThis 3-credit course activates or flexes your already-existing social justice mindset with a spatial perspective. The course is anchored around theories of spatial justice, which teach us how to critically interrogate the unequal distribution of various beneficial and detrimental environmental and social resources (examples: public transportation, hazardous waste sites, school funding, etc) which result in social inequities. Furthermore, we consider what can be done by various stakeholders including yourself to disrupt processes and discourses that have led to spatial injustices in the first place.\n\nJourneying Through Cultural Heritage Tourism\n\nAbena Aidoo Hewton : Section 005 - TR 12pm-1:15pm\n\nThis course looks at the components of cultural heritage, and cultural heritage tourism, including the characteristics of cultural heritage tourism, its significance, scope, demand, supply, opportunities, and challenges. The importance of learning how to walk the fine line of sustainable cultural heritage tourism development will be discussed, to highlight how cultural heritage can be enjoyed now, while at the same time being safeguarded for future generations. Interpretation of, or storytelling about cultural heritage is important and the course will delve into how stories are told, who tells the stories, why not all stories are told, and the implications of the storytelling. Students will have an opportunity to apply the concepts they learn to analyze actual cultural heritage tourist sites.\n\nWomen, Power and Policy\n\nBonnie Stabile : Section 006 - TR 9am-10:15am\n\nThis course will consider how women exhibit power in the public sphere, with an emphasis on the US policy context. It will examine how culture, rhetoric, law and policy influence women's representation in leadership positions across sectors, and study related implications for their personal and professional lives. The course will consider factors contributing to women's continued underrepresentation in positions of power, despite significant advancement, as well as their overrepresentation in experiencing various adverse outcomes, with a focus on how these conditions might be mitigated through policy intervention. Various tools of policy analysis will be brought into play, including relevant legal, philosophical and theoretical frameworks.\n\nAdulting 101\n\nCharles Thomas : Section 007 - M 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nAdulting 101 will be a seminar/discussion-based class in which the collective wisdom of students and guest speakers will offer insight into how to navigate the complexities and uncertainties of life. The course will be mainly student-led. You will decide the topics of discussion that matter and we will engage appropriately. Varied viewpoints will be heard and divergent thinking will be offered. Even if we disagree, we will communicate in a civil manner and learn the absolute necessity of emotion management, critical thinking, and perspective-based dialogue. Some of the conversations will be fun. Some of them will be serious. All of them will offer value as you prepare for life in the real world. You will have access to industry leaders who have learned how to \"play the game\" and can offer experience-based feedback on how to effectively manage yourself as you walk through varied life terrain. Open your mind. Come prepared to engage on topics that matter to you. Be ready to be challenged. Know that our classroom will be a safe space to be yourself. Our discussions and the subsequent internal reflection will prepare you to start the journey of becoming the person that you want to become.\n\nColonialism, Knowledge & Power\n\nSausan Ghosheh : Section 008 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm and Section 009 - W 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis course explores the intricate relationship between colonialism, knowledge, and power and their impact on our understanding of the world and our place in it. It examines the various facets of colonialism, utilizing a range of academic disciplines to analyze the power dynamics inherent in colonialism, explore resistance to colonial domination, investigate how notions of race and culture were shaped by imperial encounters, and scrutinize the impact of colonialism on peace and justice. The course also introduces students to diverse methodologies for studying colonialism, encourages them to challenge and decenter the dominance of Western/Eurocentric frameworks, and sheds light on marginalized perspectives and practices. The course fosters critical thinking, prompts students to question prevailing narratives, and encourages meaningful conversations about global justice, social equity, and the ongoing struggle for a more inclusive and just world.\n\nSustainable Tourism\n\nSusan Slocum : Section DL1 - F 1:30pm-4:10pm\n\nSustainable Tourism will consider the characteristics of environmentally, economically, and socio-culturally responsible tourism and assess the possibilities and limitations for its implementation within a variety of destinations and product settings. Conventional “mass” tourism as well as small-scale “alternative” tourism will also be emphasized. Ethical and responsible travel, as well as issues related to the development of tourism products will be considered. This is an upper-level course in tourism and events management requiring the use of information derived from: lecture/textbook material; video; general print and online library resources; and external data sources. The objective is threefold: to encourage a collaborative and supportive learning environment among students; to emphasize that students are as responsible for their learning as the instructor; and to encourage analysis and critical thinking.\n\nWomen's Rights, Law and Policy\n\nWeixia Chen: Section DL2 - F 10:30am-1:10pm\n\nThis learning community is both interdisciplinary and comparative rather than having a United States focus. Its purpose is to expose students to the complex issues - social, political, economic and legal - that characterize women’s rights around the globe. It will discuss the theoretical debate on women’s rights, culture and religion and the international legal instruments for women’s rights. It will also focus on various topics including women’s rights and environment, women’s rights and health, violence against women in peace and war, women’s rights and human trafficking and etc., from a global perspective.\n\nHNRS 261 Community Connection Practicum\n\nPeer Mentorship in Honors\n\nNadeen Makhlouf : Section 001 - F 10:30am-1:10pm\n\nThis section of HNRS 261 is a service-based learning practicum to train Honors College Peer Mentors (PMs). PMs engage in the Honors College community by mentoring first-semester students taking HNRS 110: Principles of Research and Inquiry. In addition to fostering a positive sense of community, students taking HNRS 261 are actively engaged in the ongoing process of articulating what “mentorship,” “service,” “civic engagement” and “collaborative learning” mean in the context of the Honors College curriculum. Over the course of the semester, HNRS 261 students will train to become Peer Mentors and work in collaborative teams to develop assignments and programming related to HNRS 110. Students who successfully complete HNRS 261 in Spring 2024 are eligible to apply to take HNRS 361 and serve as a Peer Mentor in Fall 2024.\n\nCollege Success Partnerships\n\nAimee Weinstein - Section 002 - W 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThink about your college application experience: did you feel confident? Overwhelmed? Do you want to use what you learned to help students who would be the first in their families to attend college? By enrolling in this section of HNRS 261, students agree to participate in the College Success Partnerships service project in conjunction with Mason’s Early Identification Program for first-generation college students. The practicum will involve learning best practices for nonprofit partnership work and putting applying them while providing support to an assigned group of high school juniors as they begin tackling their college applications and essays. Students participating in College Success Partnershipswill meet three times in-person with the students they are mentoring, and will provide resources and guidance remotely in between meetings. Students will also engage in regular class meetings (except on weeks in-person visits take place) and will complete assignments intended to help them understand and grapple with the systems that control college access, and to become effective college preparedness mentors.\n\nHonors College Connects\n\nMelanie Fedri : Section 003 - MW 12pm-1:15pm and Section 004 - MW 3pm-4:15pm\n\nIn Honors College Connects (HCC), students contribute to the work of local nonprofits addressing health, social justice, environmental, and other challenges. They build professional skills while making a real impact in the community beyond Mason, and work in teams that are mentored by peers who have previously taken the class. HCC seeks to partner with both diversely led and diversely serving nonprofits. Any questions? Email hcc@gmu.edu.\n\nCollege Success Partnerships\n\nAimee Weinstein : Section 005 - W 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThink about your college application experience: did you feel confident? Overwhelmed? Do you want to use what you learned to help students who would be the first in their families to attend college?

Students will also engage in regular class meetings (except on weeks in-person visits take place) and will complete assignments intended to help them understand and grapple with the systems that control college access, and to become effective college preparedness mentors.\n\nHNRS 360 Multi-Disciplinary Topics\n\nClimate Change and Culture\n\nTodd Stafford: Section 001 - MW 12pm-1:15pm\n\nWhat can we learn about climate change by paying attention to culture? How will cultures change in response to climate change? What cultural forms are most compatible with living in a carbon-constrained world? How are cultural forms connected to resilience and adaptation in the face of a changing climate? After exploring selected case studies that illuminate these questions as a class, students will work in small groups to explore a shared topic related to the course theme. Students will then work individually to develop their own final deliverable that explores a narrowed version of their group's topic. Final deliverables in the class may include research papers; journalistic nonfiction; zines; works of literary, visual, or performing art; video essays; a series of podcast episodes; etc. The commonality will be that each final deliverable will be informed by a rigorous research process, capaciously understood to include creative approaches.\n\nUs Against When: Exploring Peaceful Futures for the United States\n\nKeil Eggers : Section 002 - W 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nIn the field of conflict resolution, there has recently been a pivot to working in the United States to overcome polarization, restore American democracy, increase belonging and inclusion, and transform conflicts in the United States. Domestic peacebuilders seek to build bridges between people on different ends of the political spectrum and are experimenting with building networks to make the political system more resilient. The guiding question for our course is: Does our imagination for peacebuilding practice go far enough? To answer this question, we will utilize methods from the field of foresight and futures studies to collaboratively explore alternative futures for the United States and develop creative experiments that you and other change makers can do to bring that future about. Along the way, we will discuss and debate political engagement in the digital age, sensemaking, practical imagination, and how the future can be mobilized as a force for change.\n\nScience of Cities\n\nJames Trefil : Section 003 - M 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nA study of the scientific and technological aspects of the modern urban world. Research groups will study the question of how specific cities got to be the way they are and what they will look like in the future. This course has an irregular meeting pattern—some sessions are scheduled in person and some are synchronous online. Students are expected to participate in both modalities. Exams and presentations are conducted in-person, as designated in the course syllabus. Please see Patriot Web for the exact class meeting schedule.\n\nModern Scientific Revolutions\n\nJames Trefil : Section 004 - T 4:30pm-7:10pm\n\nThis course will examine the rather extraordinary changes in the way we view the universe as a result of scientific advances since 1900. This course has an irregular meeting pattern—some sessions are scheduled in person and some are synchronous online. Students are expected to participate in both modalities. Exams and presentations are conducted in-person, as designated in the course syllabus. Please see Patriot Web for the exact class meeting schedule.\n\nDean Taciuch : Section 005 - MW 1:30pm-2:45pm and Section 006 - MW 3pm-4:15pm\n\nThe quest for artificial intelligence has led to many types of “narrow AI,” most of which are better than humans at their specific skills (from playing games to predicting the structure of a protein). But the goal for much AI research is Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. A narrow AI can drive a car, for example, but it can’t play chess, or answer a trivia question. An AGI could. Much of the in AI scholarship has been on the risks of AI development: misaligned values, ethical dilemmas, economic concerns. But the rewards are immense: longer, healthier lives, more stable governments, more equitable societies, a cleaner environment, and the exploration of our universe. This course will explore current and future ethical questions of AI development, including questions of human values and identity.\n\nThe Future of Higher Education\n\nSharon Doetsch-Kidder : Section 007 - TR 3pm-4:15pm\n\nThe role of universities as tools of equity and social mobility was diminishing along with government funding when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The pandemic laid bare to many the uncertainty that was always already part of our lives and particularly our institutions and exacerbated what was already recognized by many as a mental health crisis among all ages in the U.S. In 2020, people at a large number of institutions were able to make rapid changes in pedagogies, policies, and modes of work, despite previous resistance. Many of these changes increased accessibility to some, while broader political and economic changes made it more difficult for low-income students to enroll and succeed in higher education. Student success and completion have also been negatively impacted by increasing mental health challenges, which continue even as universities work to “get back to normal” and proceed, often with reduced enrollments, reduced government funding, and, in some states, increasing restrictions on faculty and institutions. In this class, we will explore some of the current challenges facing universities and consider what practices and policies should be preserved, what should be left behind, and how we can transform higher education for a world filled with growing inequalities and unprecedented global crises. We will explore questions such as: • What is the purpose of higher education? • What roles could/should universities play in society? • Who belongs in higher education? • What should we teach? • How should we teach? • Who should pay for higher education? • What role should technology play in education? • What do we want/hope for the future of higher education? Through our exploration of current issues in higher education, students will: 1. Using multidisciplinary perspectives, connect issues in higher education to wider intellectual, community or societal concerns 2. Apply critical thinking skills to evaluate the quality, credibility and limitations of an argument or a solution using appropriate evidence or resources 3. Apply critica"
