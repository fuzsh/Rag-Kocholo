        "text": "Editor's Note: This is one of the more famous mountains made for Paramount, and a favorite among fan of their older films.\n\n6th Logo\n\n(October 8, 1975-December 12, 1986)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/f44aef72af082b0916c15a2fc78e7eb599e538cd\" width=\"329\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/1150de240890de36cc90e5118577f97e06514a4c\" width=\"329\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"Blue Mountain\", \"Abstract Mountain\", \"Fading Mountain\", \"Perumount II\"\n\nLogo: We see the same mountain with the canyon-style scenery as the previous logo, only slightly less detailed. 22 white stars fade in, encircling the mountain. The word \"Paramount\" fades in on the mountain's peak. A byline fades in at the base of the mountain:\n\nA\n\nGulf+Western\n\nCompany\n\nThe logo fades to a light blue mountain surrounded by a circular navy blue border on a light blue screen. The final product turns out to be Paramount's current print logo from that point onward, but as most print logos, they change over the years, because in the future, the byline for the print vesion of this logo will change twice. This logo is similar to the Paramount Television logo of the period, but has darker colors compared to the TV logo.\n\nTrivia: The design of this logo (namely, its animation being rather quick) allowed it to be used as a full closing logo, rather than a simple still variant.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe distance between the words and the mountain tip sometimes varies.\n\nThe size and the color tint of the logo may vary.\n\nOne variation (probably the original) has a smaller blue circle around a smaller mountain, both kind of receded. The text for \"Paramount\" is smaller than usual and the text for \"A Gulf+Western Company\" is drastically larger, along with the stars. This very strange and some consider ugly variation was seen on Hustle, Leadbelly, The Last Tycoon, Lifeguard, and Looking for Mr. Goodbar, among others. A less uglier version with re-sized text (but still keeping the receded circle and mountain) appears on some films. This version also lacks a registered trademark \"®\" symbol.\n\nA variation of this logo was used as a bumper for trailers to upcoming films with the phrase \"Coming From\" above the logo. However, trailers for Popeye and D.A.R.Y.L. among some other movies had the normal version instead.\n\nOn a promotional film for the studio, a circle of stars is seen and the logo is revealed, but is completely white.\n\nOn some French releases, the finished product looks more like the previous logo. The Gulf+Western byline is larger, in a different font, and moved up the mountain.\n\nFX/SFX: The clouds moving, the stars, company name, and byline fading in.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Often had no music, or the film's opening/closing theme. In some cases, a new orchestral fanfare by Jerry Goldsmith, based loosely on Paramount on Parade, was used on the \"Coming From\" variant of the logo on trailers for films like Islands in the Stream, Saturday Night Fever, Foul Play, and Airplane!. A few films, such as Starting Over, had this fanfare at the beginning.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nIn Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood, was used another orchestral fanfare, made by Neal Hefti, which sounds more like the original Paramount on Parade song.\n\nPre-1998 prints of Grease had a theme, which seems to be a horn re-orchestration of the intro to \"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing\" or the 1976-77 Jerry Goldsmith fanfare for Paramount Television. The Grease 40th Anniversary DVD/Blu-Ray restores the horn theme.\n\nOn the promotional film variant, a male announcer says, \"In 1985, Paramount has a whole new attitude.\"\n\nAvailability: Common. Can be found on most release versions of their mid '70s-mid '80s output. Most films released on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray, as well as TV airings, have this logo intact or restored as well.\n\nThe first film to use this logo was Mahogany and was used up until Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.\n\nIt has been restored on the recent Sony DVD release and TV broadcasts of Meatballs, which was previously plastered with the next logo.\n\nIt also appears at the end of the first two Indiana Jones films (and the third film, on the DVD release) and the 1980 film Popeye, which all had the 5th logo at the beginning.\n\nThe 1976 variation can be found on Lipstick, the original The Bad News Bears, Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood, the 1996 VHS of Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown, Gallipoli (although the recent 2015 Region 4 DVD release and a Nine Network broadcast of the film on April 25, 2015 [the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli] had it removed, and is replaced at the beginning of the film by a remastered per frame screen, however the 2005 Region 4 DVD release has it intact), US prints of Bugsy Malone and many current prints of Looking for Mr. Goodbar.\n\nSome films have this plastered over with the next logo in any of its three byline variations, such as Grease starting with its 1998 video releases, the 1976 version of King Kong, and the 2002 DVD of Mahogany (all with the Viacom byline version). Early video releases and some post-2005 prints of Top Gun retain this logo, though all other copies are plastered with the 7th logo (although the 1987 VHS of said film retained this logo only at the very end, as it was plastered by the 7th logo (\"75th Anniversary\" variant) at the beginning). Late-1990s American TV broadcasts of Dragonslayer were briefly plastered with the Viacom byline version, but recent broadcasts retain the original logo. The 2001 DVD of the Director's Cut of Star Trek: The Motion Picture also replaced this logo with the 1986 one, though it's retained on copies of the theatrical cut.\n\nThe last film to use this logo was The Golden Child (though only at the end; the 7th logo was used at the beginning of the film).\n\nOf the films released during their distribution pact with Lorimar, An Officer and a Gentleman still has this logo (albeit with Lorimar's logo removed), but the 1981 version of The Postman Always Rings Twice, Escape to Victory, Blake Edwards' S.O.B., and The Sea Wolves all have it removed (since the studio only had North American distribution rights), being replaced by the 1999 Warner Bros. logo on most current prints. Night School, however, had this and Lorimar's logo intact on a recent Movie Channel airing, and on the widescreen laserdisc, with Warner's \"Shield of Staleness\" preceding it.\n\nThe \"Coming From\" variant is usually preserved on trailers for films such as Flashdance, Saturday Night Fever, and Islands in the Stream on their DVD and Blu-ray releases. While the 8th logo plasters this (but retains the original fanfare) on the trailer for Airplane! on iTunes and on the Blu-ray release, the DVD release retains this variation.\n\nIt was most recently seen at the end of the IMAX version of Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nThis logo is seen on the 1982(?) Paramount Home Video Gateway Video VHS release of the Star Trek episode \"Space Seed\", following the 1979 Acid Trip warning and preceding the episode (the Betamax version precedes the episode with a trailer for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan after the warning, instead of the logo).\n\nThis strangely appears after the credits on the VHS of the 1993 film Jailbait (AKA: Streetwise), at least on the screener VHS.\n\nThis can also be found on Canadian prints of De Laurentiis Entertainment Group films such as The Transformers: The Movie.\n\nEditor's Note: This is also another famous mountain, and the only one that is fully abstract, though the earlier variants look really awkward and ugly with their odd differences in size.\n\n7th Logo(December 12, 1986-February 4, 2003)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/305a1a497831b38a08321a3ff98a0faf26928597\" width=\"329\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/036a3e28fe1046ac4580c40087a6b931f5fde47e\" width=\"329\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/0eb02d8f07c551c924dff3725f76a899f7a76136\" width=\"329\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/4fffb0a9ffb76e8981e69f74c6ce8e8c79582c74\" width=\"329\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"CGI Mountain\", \"'90s Mountain\", \"Majestic Mountain V\", \"Perumount III\"\n\nLogo: We see a model of a mountain, with a CGI lake in front of it and a light blue/yellow gradient sky with a yellow sunset behind it. As the sky darkens, the camera begins to zoom closer to the mountain, as 22 silver stars (also CGI) come from the bottom left and encircle the mountain, forming the familiar logo. the word \"Paramount\", in its familiar script logo font and redone in a shiny silver color, fades in on the peak of the mountain, along with the registered trademark \"®\" symbol. Seconds later, one of the three bylines (as seen below; depending on the year(s) seen below) fades in below the logo (not the international version).\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe logo was designed and composited by Studio Productions (now known as \"Flip Your Lid Animation\"), who also produced the 1994 20th Century Fox logo and the 1990-1997 Universal Pictures logo. The CGI stars were created by Omnibus/Abel and the mountain scenery was a physical model created and filmed by Apogee, Inc. The 1999 revision is alleged to have been animated at Pixar Animation Studios, though this is unconfirmed. The CGI variant (see below) was created by Pittard Sullivan.\n\nParamount used a painting that it commissioned from artist Dario Campanile for its 75th Anniversary as a basis for this logo. Said painting can be seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures#/media/File:DarioCampanile.Paramount.jpg\" target=\"_self\">here</a>."
