        "text": "This is a glossary of filmmaking terms to aid anyone studying filmmaking.\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n180 Degree Rule\n\nOne of the key features of the continuity system to which most mainstream film and television has tended to adhere. A screen direction rule in which an imaginary line is drawn between two actors in a scene, which the camera should not cross, lest the viewer becomes disorientated.\n\nA\n\nAdaptation\n\nA text in one art form based upon, derived from (or adapted from) a text in another. For example, a film based on a stage play, novel, video game or comic strip, which basically preserves some of the setting and dialogue of the original.\n\nAnimatic\n\nThe process of animating a storyboard into a moving sequence.\n\nAperture\n\nA measure of the width of the opening allowing light to enter the camera.\n\nAspect Ratio\n\nA term used to define the shape of the screen, presented in the form width:height.\n\nArt Department\n\nRresponsible for arranging the overall “look” of the film, including sets, décor, props.\n\nAssembly\n\nThe first stage of editing, in which all the shots are arranged in script order.\n\nAutomated Dialogue Replacement (ADR)\n\nThe post production re-recording of dialogue in a sound studio, usually performed to playback of edited picture in order to match lip movements on screen.\n\nB\n\nBacklighting\n\nLighting directed towards the camera from behind the subject.\n\nBest Boy\n\nAssistant to the Gaffer or the Key Grip head in either the lighting or the grip department\n\nBlocking\n\nSetting out where lighting and camera will go on the set by working out where actors will be standing or moving.\n\nBoom Microphone\n\nA long pole with a microphone on the end, extended towards the actors but placed in the ‘camera safe’ area, thus out of shot.\n\nC\n\nCamera Crew\n\nThe team directly involved with operating the camera, including clapper-loader, focus puller and grip, as well as the camera operator, all responsible to the Cinematographer/Director of Photography.\n\nCasting\n\nThe process of hiring the actors to play the characters, usually done by a casting director at auditions, with input from director and producer.\n\nCinematographer\n\nSee Director of Photography\n\nCompositing\n\nCombining visual elements from separate sources into single images or sequences, usually to create the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same scene. Also known as a matte shot.\n\nContinuity\n\nThis describes the extent to which a film has internal consistency. For example, if in a scene an actor has her hat on from one angle but is not wearing it when seen from another, the film would lose continuity. A continuity person is employed to check that continuity is maintained to avoid the expense of having to reshoot such errors.\n\nContinuity System\n\nThis is the system of editing that developed in the early 20th century to provide a continuous and clear movement of events in a film; it refers to the final edited structure of a completed film, with the events arranged as if they had occurred continuously, when, often, they were shot out of sequence. It involves a series of rules, notably the 180 degree rule, the match on action, eyeline match and shot/reverse shot.\n\nCoverage\n\nThis refers to all the shots, including close-ups and reverse angles, that a director takes in addition to the master shot, to make up the final product; to have proper coverage means having all the scenes, angles and close-ups needed to ensure that all desired options are possible in the edit.\n\nCrane Shot\n\nThis is a camera shot taken from a device that can raise the camera up in the air above the ground 20 feet or more; the crane allows the camera to fluidly move in virtually any direction (with vertical and horizontal movement), providing shifts in levels and angles; crane shots usually provide some kind of overhead view of a scene.\n\nCross Cutting\n\nThis is an editing technique involving alternating, interweaving, or interspersing one narrative action (scene, sequence, or event) with another – usually in different locations or places, thus combining the two, which suggests some kind of parallel action is taking place simultaneously. The technique is frequently used to dramatically build tension and suspense.\n\nCut\n\nA change in camera angle or placement, location, or time.\n\nD\n\nDailies\n\nThe first footage or rushes which the director and editor will see from the previous day’s shoot.\n\nDepth of Field\n\nThe range in the camera’s line of sight in which objects will be in focus.\n\nDiegetic sound\n\nA sound that comes from the world of the film, created by something or someone visible on screen or the source of which is implied as present by the action of the film.\n\nDirector\n\nThe main creative artist on a film, usually the driving artistic source who orchestrates the various other creative personnel on the film, communicating to the actors how a scene should be played. Typically, a director has complete artistic control over all aspects of the film.\n\nDirector of Photography\n\nThe head of the camera and lighting crews, responsible for the look of the film on camera. Also known as Cinematographer or Lighting Cameraperson.\n\nDissolve\n\nAn editing technique between two sequences, shots or scenes, in which the visible image of one shot or scene is gradually replaced, superimposed or blended by an overlapping fade out and fade in. It is often used to suggest the passage of time.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe process of getting the film to its audience, in all formats, including theatrical release and other formats such as DVD and online, which includes working with exhibitors and the marketing of the film.\n\nDolly\n\nA dolly refers both to a device which allows the camera to be moved along a track and to the movement itself in relation to the object which it is filming.\n\nE\n\nEditing\n\nThe process by which shots are put together into sequences or scenes.\n\nEditor\n\nSomeone who carries out the editing process, in consultation with the director.\n\nEstablishing shot\n\nThe first shot of a new scene, introducing the audience to the space in which the scene will take place.\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nThe producer who looks after business and legal issues, but has little input on the technical and creative side.\n\nExpressionism\n\nA stylised form of cinema, in which the elements of shot and editing are mobilised to evoke powerful emotion. Key features are high contrast of light and dark, extreme camera angles and shot composition.\n\nF\n\nFade-Outs\n\nEnding a shot by gradually darkening the image until it goes black.\n\nFestival\n\nA showcase event, at which films often premiere. In some cases it is an event where distribution rights are negotiated. Many festivals are competitive, with awards from a jury. For shorts, festivals are a key place for the films to be seen at all.\n\nFill Light\n\nDiffused light, usually used to offset shadows from the key light source.\n\nFirst Assistant Director\n\nResponsible for the preparation of the shooting schedule and script breakdown, working with the Director to manage operations on the set during the process of filming, tracking the progress of filming versus the production schedule and ensuring that all safety and contract rules are adhered to.\n\nFlashback\n\nA scene which breaks with the forward chronology of the story to show events which happened in the past.\n\nFocus\n\nThe sharpness of an image and adjustments made on the camera to achieve it.\n\nFoley\n\nRecreating sound effects (such as footsteps) in synchronisation with the visual element of a movie.\n\nG\n\nGaffer\n\nChief electrician, responsible for the design and execution of the lighting plan for a production.\n\nGrip\n\nSpecialist crew working under the Key Grip to provide camera mounts and support, especially if the camera is on a track, dolly or crane. In the USA grips support the lighting department as well.\n\nH\n\nHigh Key Lighting\n\nA style of lighting that is bright, even and produces little contrast between light and dark areas of the scene.\n\nI\n\nIn Camera Editing\n\nFilming in the order required for the final product, thereby eliminating the editing stage.\n\nIndependent Film\n\nA film which has not been produced by one of the major studios.\n\nInsert\n\nA close up shot of an object to be inserted into the film at the edit stage.\n\nK\n\nKey Grip\n\nHeads the team on a film set that rig and operate camera mounting equipment such as dolly, track or crane. They may rig other mounted film set equipment.\n\nKey light\n\nThe main light on a subject, often angled and off-centre that selectively illuminates various prominent features of the image to produce depth and shadows.\n\nL\n\nLocation Filming\n\nFilming which occurs at a place not constructed specifically for the film, such as outdoors, a well-known place, or in an interior suited to the purpose.\n\nLocation Manager\n\nOrganises various aspects of filming on location, such as arranging with authorities for permission to shoot in specific places.\n\nLow Key lighting\n\nA term used in cinematography to refer to high contrast lighting, especially if there is a predominance of shadowy areas.\n\nM\n\nMajors\n\nThe major Hollywood movie producer/distributor studios (MGM/UA, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros, Paramount Pictures, Universal, and Disney).\n\nMaster shot\n\nA continuous shot that shows the main action or setting of an entire scene which will often be used as the establishing shot for the scene before moving into closer shots during editing.\n\nMatch cut\n\nA technique in which a cut between two linked shots helps to seamlessly match them together. For example, a cut on the moment of opening a door to the same moment inside the room.\n\nMise-en-scene\n\nLiterally translates as “what is put into the scene”, includes décor, colours, costume, props, even the human figure. It is the sum of production design.\n\nO\n\nOff-line\n\nThe preliminary editing done to prepare a list of edits for the on-line edit stage.\n\nOn-line\n\nThe final editing and preparation for distribution of film, with edits often from a list of changes prepared during the off-line stage.\n\nP\n\nPan\n\nA shot which involves the horizontal movement of the camera in one direction while filming from a fixed axis.\n\nPoint of View\n\nA camera angle in which the camera views what would be visible from a particular subject’s position.\n\nPost-Production\n\nWork performed on a movie after the end of shooting. It includes editing and any visual effects.\n\nPre-Production\n\nArrangements made before the start of filming, such as editing the script, constructing sets, finding locations and casting.\n\nPre-visualisation Artist\n\nA specialist task involving conceptualising a sequence, often involving complex and expensive action, through the use of 3D FX character animation.\n\nProducer\n\nResponsible for raising finance, hiring key crew and arranging distribution. May also be involved in the day to day shoot at a more creative level.\n\nProduction\n\nCan mean both the whole process of making a film, or more specifically the actual shoot.\n\nProduction design\n\nThis refers to the overall look and composition and is the responsibility of the production designer.\n\nProduction Manager\n\nReports to the Producer, supervising budget.\n\nProduction Sound Mixer\n\nIn charge of sound on the set, including selection and operation of the microphones and recording equipment and directing the boom operator.\n\nProp\n\nAnything to be used by actors on set.\n\nR\n\nReverse Shot\n\nWhen used in dialogue scenes, reverse-shot editing usually alternates between over-the-shoulder shots that show each character speaking.\n\nS\n\nScore\n\nThe music in a film soundtrack, sometimes written specifically by a composer, sometimes put together from existing songs by a musical director.\n\nScreenplay\n\nA script written to be produced as a film.\n\nScreenwriter\n\nThe writer who either adapts an existing work or creates a new screenplay.\n\nScript\n\nA general term for a written work detailing story, setting, and dialogue.\n\nSet\n\nAn environment constructed especially for filming.\n\nSequence\n\nA scene, or connected series of related scenes in a film.\n\nShot list\n\nA list given to the film crew which indicates the order of shooting for the day.\n\nSound Designer\n\nThe leading creative for a film soundtrack, especially in post-production.\n\nSound Recordist\n\nAlso known as Production Sound Mixer, the person who records the audio on the shoot.\n\nSpecial Effects\n\nSomething used to create an illusion in a film.
