        "text": "The Victoria Cross was created on 29 January 1856 and recognises acts of extreme bravery carried out under direct enemy fire.\n\nIt was the first bravery medal that could be earned by anyone in the Army or the Navy and the act which earns the award must be witnessed by several individuals. The Victoria Cross was named after Queen Victoria, who personally chose the inscription, 'For Valour'. The design shows a lion guarding the Royal Crown, emphasising the personal link between the British monarch and recipients of the VC.\n\nThe Victoria Cross was handmade, traditionally using bronze taken from a gun captured in the Crimean War and has been awarded to over 1,300 people since its creation. It was deliberately intended to have little actual value â€“ its value lies in what it stands for and what people do to earn it\n\nThis Victoria Cross (with blue 'Naval' ribbon) awarded during the First World War to Boy, 1st Class John Travers Cornwell for gallantry displayed as a sight setter for the crew of the 5.5-inch gun on the forecastle of the light cruiser HMS Chester during the Battle of Jutland, 31 May 1916.\n\nSee the Victoria Cross on Collections online.\n\nThe George Cross was created on 24 September 1940 and recognises acts of extreme bravery carried out by civilians and military personal when not under enemy fire. The act which earns the award must be witnessed by several individuals.\n\nThe George Cross was named after King George VI, who personally designed many details on the medal. The inscription reads 'For Gallantry'. The words surround an image of St George slaying a dragon and is made from solid silver by the Royal Mint.\n\nSince its creation, more than 400 people have been awarded the George Cross.\n\nThis George Cross awarded to Captain Mahmood Durrani, 1st Bahawalpur Infantry, for supreme bravery as a prisoner of war in the Second World War.\n\nSee the George Cross on Collections online."
