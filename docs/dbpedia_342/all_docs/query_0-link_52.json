        "text": "There’s a reason why “representation matters” has long been a rallying cry for the LGBTQ community: From books to movies to television, the stories we consume have the power to shape how we see other people—and ourselves. So when a film comes along that manages to really nail the queer experience, well, suffice it to say, we as a community hold on tight to our favorites. Here are 55 of the most beloved LGBTQ movies of all time, ranging from subtle and quiet to political and groundbreaking.\n\nNew Queer Cinema pioneer Gregg Araki’s eighth film is perhaps his most well-known to date. Following two teenage boys as they struggle to cope—in wildly different ways—with a shared childhood trauma, Mysterious Skin features memorable early performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbett. (The former was in the thick of his transition from child star to adult actor, whereas the latter was himself still a teenager at the time.) In the film, Gordon-Levitt’s character Neil turns to sex work at the age of 15 in an effort to reconcile his burgeoning queerness with his memories of abuse.\n\nThe trans representation in this Sidney Lumet-directed classic about a bank robbery gone wrong probably wouldn’t win any GLAAD awards today: Sonny’s (Al Pacino) lover, a trans woman named Leon (Chris Sarandon) who needs money for gender confirmation surgery, is consistently referred to in the film as a man. However, Dog Day Afternoon was perhaps the first major motion picture to openly and sympathetically portray queer characters—even flawed ones—as figures deserving of the audience’s love and support. What initially seems like a comedy about an inept criminal proves more complicated as we learn about Sonny’s motivations for robbing the bank.\n\nJohn Waters has worked hard for his nickname as The Pope of Trash. Though best known for his (comparatively) mainstream movies—especially Cry-Baby and Hairspray—the godfather of raunchy queer cinema originally made his name as a director of wildly offensive, chronically X-rated cult films. Perhaps the most iconic of these is Pink Flamingos, starring frequent Waters collaborator Divine as a criminal who learns that she has been named “the filthiest person alive” and sets out to defend her title from a pair of jealous rivals. The film includes a number of controversial scenes that could be triggering — so, watch at your own risk."
