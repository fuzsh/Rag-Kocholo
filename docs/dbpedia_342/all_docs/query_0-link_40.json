        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Mean Girls\" hit theaters in 2004, but some fans still might not have caught these fun details.\n\nThere are a few spelling errors and fitting quotes on the chalkboards in Cady's classes.\n\nHoop earrings become an important status symbol throughout the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegina's bus accident is foreshadowed at the beginning of the movie.\n\nCady is almost hit by a bus when her parents send her off for her first day of school, which seems to foreshadow Regina's unfortunate bus accident toward the end of the film.\n\nCady also describes the feeling of seeing Aaron Samuels for the first time as getting hit by \"a big yellow school bus.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorth Shore High School's mascot fits nicely with all of Cady's metaphors about the animal kingdom.\n\nAlthough North Shore High School isn't real, it was said to be inspired by New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, outside of Chicago.\n\nThe fictional school has a clearly defined mascot (the lions) and colors (blue and yellow), which can be seen on posters, gym uniforms, and letterman jackets throughout the movie.\n\nThe mascot fits nicely with Cady's frequent metaphors about the similarities between high school and the African savanna, seeing as lions are the kings of the animal kingdom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a few continuity errors in the scene where Ms. Norbury is introduced.\n\nWhen Cady bumps into Ms. Norbury on the first day of school, it causes the teacher to spill her drink and fumble a box of doughnuts.\n\nWhen the drink spills on her, she's clearly wearing brown pants. But by the time she gets her soaked sweater off, her pants have magically turned black.\n\nAdditionally, while Principal Duvall is introducing Cady, doughnuts suddenly appear and disappear on top of the box Ms. Norbury set down on her desk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey found a way to write actor Tim Meadows' injury into the script.\n\nWhile Mr. Duvall is in Ms. Norbury's class, he says that his carpal tunnel flared up over the summer and lifts up his casted arm as proof.\n\nPer ScreenRant, Tim Meadows, who played the principal, actually broke his hand right before they started shooting, so they quickly added the line to explain away the cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a subtle reference to plastic in the form of a misspelling on the science teacher's board.\n\nWhen Cady asks to use the bathroom in her science class, the chalkboard behind her teacher shows a list of elements.\n\nOne of the elements, silicon, is spelled wrong. But this may have been a purposeful error given that silicone (as it's written on the board) is a common material used in plastic surgery, and the school's queen bees call themselves the Plastics.\n\nCady seemed to go to the wrong language class on her first day.\n\nDuring the montage on Cady's first day of school, she's shown being yelled at by a teacher in German. But she later tells Damian that she's taking a Spanish class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie shows and mentions plenty of brands.\n\nThere are plenty of brand names shown and mentioned throughout the movie, which is initially apparent when Cady goes to lunch on the first day of school.\n\nThere are Dasani, Coca-Cola, Red Bull, Gatorade, and Doritos products on the tables she passes.\n\nLater on, when the sales clerk at a fictional store tells Regina she can't fit into her size-five dress, she tells her to try the real-life department store Sears instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanis and Damian both wore statement T-shirts in their first scene.\n\nWhen Janis and Damian first decide to befriend Cady, they're both wearing statement tees.\n\nJanis' says \"Rubbish,\" and Damian's says \"I see ugly people.\"\n\nThe shirts make them stand out from their fashion-forward classmates and further cement their outsider status at the school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanis' cafeteria map is incredibly accurate.\n\nTo help acclimate Cady to North Shore High, Janis draws her a very detailed map with a cross-section of the lunchroom.\n\nIt labels the different tables where the school's many cliques sit, and there are even arrows showing which parts of the lunch line sell different varieties of sad cafeteria food.\n\nShe also included a little \"you are here\" marking next to the football field in the spot where Janis, Damian, and Cady sat on the first day.\n\nAnd next to a row of trees she wrote, \"Make-out zone warning! There is sexual activity in these woods.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs. Norbury's bartending vest has some interesting pins.\n\nWhen Ms. Norbury runs into Cady, Damian, and Janis at the mall before her bartending job, she's wearing a well-decorated vest that the high schoolers make fun of before they realize who's wearing it.\n\nThe vest is adorned with many pins, which include slogans like \"Never Stop Learning\" and \"Say What?\" There's also a patch of a vintage-looking clown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMrs. George wears pink on Wednesdays, too.\n\nWhen Cady visits Regina's house for the first time, Mrs. George greets them wearing a baby-pink velour tracksuit.\n\nThroughout the film, we learn more about the mom's affinity for staying young and hanging with the high schoolers, but this is the first glimpse we get at Mrs. Geroge trying to be a member of the Plastics.\n\nAs we learned when the girls told Cady the rules of the clique, on Wednesdays, they wear pink — and apparently, Mrs. George follows those rules, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanis and Damian are watching a \"Friday the 13th\" movie when Cady surprises them.\n\nWhen Cady scares Janis and Damian on Halloween by walking in on them in her \"ex-wife\" costume, they appear to be watching \"Friday the 13th: Part 2,\" based on the VHS box sitting on top of the TV.\n\nBut there are also a few other visible VHS boxes close by, including one for \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe girls wear plastic skirts for the talent show.\n\nThe Plastics' performance of \"Jingle Bell Rock\" in sexy Santa outfits is one of the most iconic parts of the film.\n\nThe skirts they're all wearing are clearly made of shiny plastic material, which may have been an allusion to the name of their clique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a fitting Shakespeare quote on the board during the candy-gram scene.\n\nDuring the scene where Damian hands out candy canes and delivers the memorable line, \"Four for you Glen Coco. You go, Glen Coco,\" there's a quote on the board behind him from \"The Two Noble Kinsmen.\"\n\nThe play, which is jointly attributed to William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, features three queens seeking revenge — not unlike the queen bees in \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nCady gets back a test from October after winter break.\n\nAfter winter break, Cady gets a math test back from October 14, which seems like a rather long time to wait for a score, especially since the test would've been from the previous semester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGretchen wears the same sweater on two different days.\n\nThe Plastics wear fashionable outfits throughout the movie that have since become iconic.\n\nSince they have so many rules about what they wear, it wouldn't be a stretch to assume they're against outfit repeating. But Gretchen rewears her argyle sweater from the first day of school when she's comforting Regina after her breakup with Aaron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCady gets an initial necklace that looks just like Regina's.\n\nThroughout the movie, Cady embraces becoming a Plastic and slowly transforms into a copycat Regina George.\n\nOne scene where this change is apparent is when she shows up to school after winter break wearing a \"C\" necklace that looks a lot like the \"R\" one Regina wears throughout the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegina has a recognizable stuffed animal in her room.\n\nRegina's room is massive — she says she stole it from her parents — and it's decorated with rich reds and pinks.\n\nDespite her grown-up tastes, there are a few stuffed animals scattered around her room, including a Hello Kitty on her dresser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCady starts wearing hoop earrings after they kick Regina out of the Plastics.\n\nWhen Cady first gets Gretchen to \"crack,\" Gretchen tells her that Regina doesn't let any of them wear hoop earrings because they're her \"thing.\" She couldn't even wear the white-gold hoops her parents got her for Hanukkah.\n\nLater in the film, after the Plastics kick Regina out of the group, Cady cements her position as the new ultimate queen bee by wearing pink hoops at her house party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCady seems to be riding an Asia elephant, not an African one, in the picture in her bedroom.\n\nWhen Aaron is looking through the pictures in Cady's room during her party, he comes across one of her riding an elephant as a kid in Africa, where she grew up.\n\nBut based on the size and shape of the elephant's ears, it seems to be an Asian species, not African.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanis' painting shows a pre-makeover Cady.\n\nJanis submits a painting to her art show of herself, Damian, and Cady.\n\nThe painting shows Cady as she looked at the beginning of the school year before her makeover — especially her hair, which is in the same style of ponytail that she wore on the first day of school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie includes some details that cement its Illinois setting.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, Cady mentions that her family moved to Illinois for her mother's new job at Northwestern University, which is located in Evanston, just outside of Chicago.\n\nThere are also visible Illinois license plates throughout the film, and the Mathletes compete at the Illinois High School State Championship to further cement the Midwest setting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoach Carr makes a spelling mistake during health class.\n\nCoach Carr is a questionable sex-ed teacher at best, and during the second health-class scene, he even misspells one of the common sexually transmitted infections.\n\nAs he writes the list on the chalkboard, he starts spelling chlamydia with a \"K.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Walker Brother's Pancake House is a real chain restaurant.\n\nDuring the Spring Fling, Mr. Duvall announces that the students crowned king and queen will receive two gift certificates to the Walker Brother's Pancake House.\n\nThe restaurant, also known as the Original Pancake House, is a real chain in Illinois.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegina seems to have thought Janis was a lesbian because she's Lebanese.\n\nToward the beginning of the movie, Damian insinuates that Regina stopped being friends with Janis because she thought she was a lesbian, and Regina explicitly confirms this later on.\n\nJanis hastily stops the conversation whenever someone brings it up, but a short scene at the end of the film seems to serve as the punchline to this joke.\n\nWhen Kevin grabs Janis for a dance at the Spring Fling, he asks her if she's Puerto Rican, and she responds that she's Lebanese — possibly implying that Regina just didn't know the difference between lesbian and Lebanese.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGretchen finally gets to wear hoops again at the end of the film.\n\nThroughout the movie, Gretchen follows Regina's rule about not wearing hoop earrings.\n\nBut at the end of the film, when Cady is narrating where everyone ended up, the shot pans to Gretchen in the lunchroom, and she's finally wearing her beloved hoops.\n\nThis story was originally published on April 30, 2021, and most recently updated on October 3, 2023.\n\nWhen you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission.
