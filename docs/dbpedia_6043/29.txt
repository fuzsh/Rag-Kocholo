This week, the Register marks two years of Varsity Arts and its continuous weekly high school arts coverage. We asked readers, teachers, administrators, students and parents what kind of impact they thought Varsity Arts has had in their classrooms, schools and communities. Here’s what they had to say:

“As I prepare to once again take award-winning students to Sacramento for California Youth in Theater Day, this year I’m packing in my bag a scrapbook of almost 30 full pages of clippings from Varsity Arts with stories and pictures that were published about Tri-School Theatre students during the past year. We are preparing to meet with state legislators and to be advocates of the arts in education. This scrapbook of articles will be hard evidence of our students’ accomplishments and impact on our community.

“During the time since the inception of Varsity Arts, I have had administrators, teachers and parents seek me out to talk when they see a news story about us. They are impressed with the scope of our program, and they start asking me about upcoming productions because they want to see it for themselves. Students are proud to add these articles to their portfolios. Parents are thrilled that it’s not just student athletes getting recognition, but artists as well. I appreciate living in a society that values academics, athletics and the arts, and Varsity Arts helps to balance the recognition of our students in these fields. We are cultivating not just artists, but also future audience members for plays, musicals, concerts and museums.” – Hillary Pearson, executive artistic director, Tri-School Theatre

“I applaud the Register for providing continuous coverage of high school arts in our community. I look forward to this section each week. By producing Varsity Arts, the Register makes a statement that high school arts are important and flourishing in Orange County. Our community produces so many talented high school students who go on to do so much with their craft. Thank you for showcasing them for the enjoyment of readers like me. Bravo!” – Cynthia Selva, Register reader

“What percentage of the population has an article or picture featuring them published in a major newspaper? Now, deduct those with nefarious implications. The opportunity for positive recognition in this form is one of the most inspiring events that can happen in a student’s life. It’s the stuff that goes into the family scrapbook, that becomes a treasured heirloom, that is framed and placed on the bedroom or office wall.

“Varsity Arts has afforded this privilege to my show choir students at Katella High School, and the impact has been immeasurable. My students are so proud. The principal was thrilled and the article is posted throughout the school. These students seldom receive recognition, so this is truly a lifelong memory.” – Pam Chant, drama and show choir director, Katella High School

•••

“Varsity Arts has shown our kids that their work as future artists is important and recognized. In an area where the arts and entertainment is the second largest employer and the No. 1 export to the world, we need to stop thinking of the arts only as an advocation that makes people well-rounded and start seeing the arts as a great career choice. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 65 percent of today’s grade school kids will end up at a job that hasn’t been invented yet. Most of those jobs will be some hybrid of arts and technology. Thanks to the Register for being on the forefront of changing people’s attitudes towards the arts.” – Zoot Velasco, executive director, Muckenthaler Cultural Center

•••

“Enrollment is up in the ceramics/studio arts classes at Capo Valley. Kids love seeing their names in the paper.” – Brian Schultz, fine-arts teacher, Capistrano Valley High School

•••

“The Varsity Arts section of the Register has been a great source of student motivation and recognition. When I mentioned to my students that their project was being considered for a feature story, they immediately upped their game. They wanted to represent themselves and their school at the highest level possible and constantly asked when the newspaper folks would arrive. Many of my students have had limited exposure to written news, and this was also a great way to illustrate that there are other news sources besides social media and the Internet (although we did access the story on the Register web page, too).

“The day that the reporter and photographer arrived, my students were very excited and proud to show their work. Some even made sure to look their best in case they were featured in a photo.

“In short, the Varsity Arts section is a great community resource and showcase for our students and we hope to have the opportunity to submit additional work in the future.” – Steve Foster, visual and performing arts chairman, Saddleback High School

“I am an arts professor (film, writing, art) at the Taiwan national university, teaching undergrad and graduate students.

“Varsity Arts is one of the most important, unique contributions of a major newspaper because it highlights and supports the future of creativity in America.

“In this sad short-sighted era of eliminating the arts from high school curriculum, your contribution is desperately needed and useful. Several Orange County students told me that it helps their morale, so they no longer feel they’re alone or unnecessary in society (even if they do in their own families). Varsity Arts may actually be the determining factor in their decisions to continue creating or abandoning art.

“Thank you for inspiring some of my future students.” – Ron Norman, professor, Taipei National University of the Arts, Taipei, Taiwan

“Varsity Arts gives student artists a space to feel recognized, appreciated, connected and inspired. In high school, there are no pep rallies encouraging people to come watch the annual dance concert and no banners strung up in the gym for a first-rate performance of ‘Macbeth.’ Arts programs are often a small (but mighty!) presence on campus, which can make participating in theater instead of joining a sport feel like going against the grain, and however angsty teenagers may be, feeling under appreciated and unpopular is not an ideal mindset for creativity.

“This is why Varsity Arts is such a necessary space. Not only does it raise public awareness of the incredible art being produced by students, but it allows student artists to see what work their peers are creating at other schools. As a high school student, I participated in the Cappies program, which meant my friends and I spent many Friday nights carpooling to nearby high schools to watch and review student theater productions. Although watching peer performances was endlessly inspiring, my favorite part about the program was getting to know the other critics, who were often performers as well. Through conversations with students from all over Orange County I came to realize that other schools had arts programs just like our own filled with other singers, dancers, and actors just like myself. Suddenly, ‘doing art’ didn’t feel so much like going against the grain – it felt like I belonged to a bigger community.

“OC Varsity Arts fosters this same feeling and encourages a dialogue between artists, which acts as a conduit of inspiration. Nothing motivates more than seeing a peer push the limits and succeed.” – Marisa Shimano, former Cappie/dancer/actor, Dana Hills High School (class of 2012)

•••

“The Varsity Arts section of the Register has been an important addition to the newspaper and has served a vital role in the Orange County community. Visual and performing arts students deserve equal recognition with athletes. The hours they devote to their respective disciplines, the skills they hone and the talent that is showcased in high school arts programs should be celebrated and recognized. We are grateful to Heide Janssen and Varsity Arts for providing this coverage.

“At Santa Margarita Catholic High School, our students have had the opportunity to utilize the articles in their portfolios for college admissions. Of particular note, these articles have advanced our efforts to elevate the visibility of the theater and music programs at SMCHS throughout the community as we move forward with the design of our new Center for the Arts on campus.

“The Register has been a staunch supporter of the Cappies critic writing program as well. Many of our students have been published and these reviews provide student writers a professional forum for their critiques. These reviews help to develop theater audiences and encourage student writers thereby guaranteeing that future generations will grow up with an appreciation for theater and music.

“As an arts advocate, there is nothing more important than ensuring the survival of arts programs within our schools. Varsity Arts is a critical partner in this endeavor. The newspaper is still a viable and powerful force for good within the community. Arts coverage increases readership and online digital subscriptions. I know that many of our parents subscribed to the newspaper specifically because of the Varsity Arts section.

“It is my sincere hope that the Register will continue its mission of journalistic integrity by including high school arts coverage weekly.” – Amy Luskey-Barth, director of theater arts, Santa Margarita Catholic High School

•••

“Being recognized in the Varsity Arts section has helped put our school on the map and has created a sense of artistic pride in our community. I refer to the posted articles near the entry of my classroom to all our visitors and classes. This promotes that they too can excel in an AP class and dominate. The power of hard work and being commended for their creative efforts is priceless. We can’t thank you enough.” – Marjorie Brown, fine-arts teacher, Buena Park High School

•••

“(At a recent regional drama teachers meeting), I showed my colleagues the full page color spread of my students in our school’s production of ‘Dracula’ and the Artist of the Week article on my student Shane Reichel in ‘The 39 Steps.’ The coverage of theater students in the Varsity Arts section of the Register is the envy of drama teachers in Los Angeles Unified School District.” – Grace Stanton, drama teacher, Valencia High School

•••

“Varsity Arts has vastly changed the landscape of high school arts in Orange County. By bringing these young artists to the fore, the public is able to see another side of high school life. High school isn’t just about Friday night lights, cheerleaders and AP classes (which I find important). These students are achieving at equally high levels. Their achievements are worth sharing and reading about, and their contributions to our cultural life in Orange County makes us a better community.

“As an arts teacher (music) and high school department chair, Varsity Arts has allowed us to see where our students stand alongside the very best high school students in the county. It has allowed us to learn about the great high school arts programs across the county and focus our efforts to achieve at the same level. It has allowed our teachers to re-evaluate and reflect on our curriculum and instructional strategies and outcomes. It has also allowed us to validate our successes when compared to other programs across the county.

“For me, Varsity Arts is a must-read every week. I know every time I pick up the Varsity Arts section I’m going to finish reading with a smile on my face and a renewed sense of faith in young people, faith in teachers and faith in our community. Thank you for including this great news in your newspaper.” – Jim Kollias, visual and performing arts chairman, Beckman High School

•••

“I look forward to reading the Varsity Arts section of the Orange County Register each week. I have been a subscriber to the Register for 30 years. I was a high school drama coach for 18 years and attend theater performances several times each month. It is so great to read about the high school students doing superb theater work in Orange County.” – Larry Bowen, longtime Register subscriber

“The weekly Varsity Arts section of the OC Register is a must-read for me. It informs the community of the many outstanding arts programs, both performing and visual, that flourish in our schools. We learn about the students and their creative talents, as well as the outstanding teachers who provide challenges and encouragement to their students. Thus, the community gets to know how the arts programs, as well as being academic and practical in their own right, greatly enrich the students’ lives and support the other academic and vocational programs offered. Hopefully this will keep the arts programs alive and well in our schools and thus provide a continuous flow of new artists into our Orange County communities. I salute the Register for providing this opportunity for its readers.” – Michael Jacobs, fine-arts dean emeritus, Cypress College

“It is important that I communicate some fond memories of my daughter (Claudia Doucette) being featured on the front page of Varsity Arts on Sunday, May 5, 2013. Claudia attended Fullerton Union High School and was very involved with the music program under the supervision of Scott Hedgecock. She was a member of the vocal ensemble choir and participated in the annual high school festival at the Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Master Chorale. (The Register) shadowed us there, took pictures, interviewed the students and parent chaperones and reported a wonderful event. I proudly carried that newspaper article everywhere to share it with friends and mailed copies to our family who live in other states. Claudia is now at a university majoring in music, vocal performance. Thank you for your influence and inspirational reporting. It was truly a special experience for Claudia.” – Toni Diltz, arts parent

•••

“The ‘Varsity Arts effect’ on community awareness of the arts has really been powerful. Having students showcased from our high school in this section has been a positive force in so many ways. Besides teaching, I also run a major theater in Orange County and direct choirs for church and community groups. It is always so exciting to have a choir member or a theater patron actually bring articles they have clipped from Varsity Arts to me as they say, ‘Look! Your kids were in the Register!’ This tells me that it is reaching a broad spectrum of readers, and what’s more, they now look for the articles, so I know they are scanning the paper at least once a week. Community awareness of the arts is so important for these students – not only as an affirmation and nod to their talents, but as a builder of self-confidence – something every teen welcomes and needs. Thanks, Varsity Arts for your efforts and support of our youth.” – Tim Nelson, musical theater director, Huntington Beach Academy for the Performing Arts; managing director, Rose Center Theater; director of choirs, Grace Lutheran Church of Huntington Beach

•••

“At Santa Ana High School, the impact can be seen in the following ways: our students love seeing what other schools are producing (this is their favorite thing); they have been surprised on how different the projects are that each school creates and are inspired to take risks; they love seeing pictures of themselves and their performing groups in the paper (of course!); I love how some of my fellow faculty have put copies of interesting articles from Varsity Arts in my mailbox at school; during our faculty meetings, when Santa Ana has been presented in Varsity Arts, it is shared with the staff; and I have posted many articles in the dance studio and hallway display case.” – Barbara Noel, dance teacher, Santa Ana High School

•••

“I think the attention you are bringing to Orange County Schools is great and wish we had the equivalent in Los Angeles.” – Jeffe Huls, performing arts chairman, Santa Monica High School

•••

“I’m a senior, live in Anaheim, and have a great enjoyment for theater and musicals. I am a member of Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, the senior program at Cal State Fullerton, and often attend the university plays. I have been reading the Varsity Arts section of the Register for a few years, which prompted me to attend three high school musicals in the last two years. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing “The Drowsy Chaperone” at Plummer by La Habra High School. Then I enjoyed “Anything Goes” by Fullerton Union High School, also at Plummer. Another year, I found out about “Into the Woods” performed by Orange Lutheran High.

“Unless I learn about high school musicals in the Register, I am unlikely to even know they are being performed. I hope the Varsity Arts section will not be discontinued.” – Judy Brazell, Register reader

•••

“I’ve been happy to see it back as its own section! I am always inspired and impressed by the stories of what students and teachers are doing in the arts throughout Orange County. Seeing the breadth, quality and creativity of what is going on in our county arts programs has been stimulating to me as a teacher of the arts.” – Len Montgomery, fine-arts department chair, Brethren Christian High School

•••

“We are thankful to Varsity Arts for creating a unifying and supportive forum for the arts in Orange County. This recognition of the talented and hardworking young artists in our community has encouraged more innovation, creativity and passion from the students and leaders in Pacific Symphony Youth Ensembles while bolstering a feeling of community in the spirit of artistic excellence. Our students have been inspired to go above and beyond the imaginable to give back to the community by leading service projects to help spread the joy of music through their own neighborhoods. This support has been seen in our sold-out concerts and record-breaking audition turnout for the 2014-15 season, which would not have been possible without the dedication and passion of our school programs, teachers and artistic leaders of Orange County. Thank you, Orange County Register, for supporting the artists of today and the professionals of tomorrow.” – Pacific Symphony and Pacific Symphony Youth Ensembles

•••

“The Varsity Arts section gives validation to our young, talented and very hard-working high school artists of all stripes. Artists are overwhelmingly self-motivated and driven by the artistic process, but it is nice when they can be brought into the light and celebrated the way sports and academics are. These are the creative minds that will discover solutions to social and environmental problems in ways we haven’t yet dreamt. The Varsity Arts section supports what I believe to be one of our greatest human assets: creative and critical thinking.” – Kevin Bachelder, director of the advanced institute of art and writing, Tarbut V’Torah Community Day School

•••

“It is just fantastic to open my morning paper and read about the positive and creative things our young and artistically talented students are accomplishing. Keep up the great work.” – Don Gunderson, retired music educator

•••

“Having the feats of our students shared with the community has not only excited the kids, but their parents and avid APA show-goers as well. The kids work so hard and their parents know that. When their work hits the stage, everyone can tell that they’re giving it their all. What we really love is when people we don’t even know call us and tell us there’s an article in the newspaper about us. This has happened countless times and we love it!” – Emily Iverson, public relations, Huntington Beach Academy for the Performing Arts

•••

“As principal of Valencia High School, I appreciate the opportunity that Varsity Arts provides to highlight and celebrate our talented visual and performing arts students, teachers and programs. The arts are an important and valued part of our students’ education at Valencia High School and I am grateful for the support from Varsity Arts.” – Rick Lopez, principal, Valencia High School

•••

“Highlighting students for accomplishments in all areas is essential in order to celebrate diversity of talents and encourage students with a myriad of abilities to continue to pursue their interests. Athletic endeavors are well advertised. It’s nice to see the arts get coverage as well. The positive press helps educate the readers about our amazing young people.” – Sherry Kropp, superintendent, Los Alamitos Unified School District

•••

“The arts coverage is SO great! From an educators viewpoint, the impact on a student’s confidence for positive recognition is probably the single most potent way to get them to take chances and continue to grow as lifelong learners. The students and their families are so moved by having anyone acknowledge their hard work. I think its probably a challenge to cover something like art because it might not be as easy to describe as writing about athletics. I think Frank Zappa said that ‘talking about music is like dancing about architecture.’ It means so much to these young artists to have their work acknowledged.” – Alex Graham, media tech teacher, Canyon High School

•••

“The Varsity Arts section of the Register has lifted the level of awareness of the great art that is happening in Orange County. The wide range of visual arts techniques, dance collaborations, innovative theater productions, choir competitions, instrumental performances and collaborations and films reflecting the teenage minds have all been acknowledged and in the spotlight for the last two years. Thank you for the opportunities you have given the students to shine.” – Nancy Harrell, fine-arts department chairwoman, JSerra Catholic High School

•••

“Varsity Arts has raised the level of ceramics at Trabuco Hills High School. Students have become more motivated in their assignments when they think their projects might be showcased in Varsity Arts. Students also take great pride in seeing their names and photographs of their artworks in the newspaper. The paper also promotes our upcoming events, which brings recognition to the students and school. I hope that this section continues to highlight and showcase our high school art students.” – Jacque Fait, ceramics teacher, Trabuco Hills High School

•••

“My parents don’t subscribe to the Register, so every Tuesday (now, Thursday), I go to the grocery store to buy a copy so that I can see if my school has been mentioned in Varsity Arts.” – Anonymous student, Santa Ana

•••

“I look forward to every Tuesday to see what other schools around the county are producing. At La Quinta High School we give each of the students who get a featured write-up in the Register their own display cabinet in the visual arts hallway as well as recognition of their portfolio works. The student is also recognized in the student announcements throughout the school.” – Preston Aldous, photography teacher, La Quinta High School

•••

“Varsity Arts coverage in the Register has had a profound impact on our students. Thank you for bringing attention to these wonderfully talented students. It brings teachers such pride to see their students in the spotlight in print.” – Francisco Javier Calvo, performing arts department coordinator, Santa Margarita Catholic High School

•••

“I love this section of the newspaper. It keeps me updated on what’s going on in the arts departments in the high schools. Students are so fortunate to be able to have this in their high schools. Most of all I love seeing students I teach or have taught being recognized for their talents, and sometimes it’s even in another genre. Thanks for keeping the arts alive and for recognizing these amazing talented artists!” – Lauren Shavitz, dance teacher

•••

“In a February issue of Varsity Arts, Valley Vista High School, located in Fountain Valley, was featured for an art show put on by the art department. Being that Valley Vista is a continuation school and does not get much recognition, it was an amazing opportunity for us. Valley Vista gives students a second chance to succeed in an encouraging and specialized environment. Having our students recognized for their efforts not only gives them a sense of pride, but also allows them to see that they are capable of succeeding in other ways. Many of our students are extremely talented, which I believe as an art teacher, needs to be seen by the public. Varsity Arts gave these students that opportunity to be heard and I believe the article gave our students a sense of hope and encouragement that all people need in order to reach their full potential.” – Michelle Delanty, art department chairwoman, Valley Vista High School

•••

“As an art educator, I appreciate any “kudos” given to the field. Your section of Varsity Arts helps to educate the general public as to what Orange County students are doing in art classes, but more importantly shows that art is still in the public school system. Many people believe that the budget cuts have removed all the arts from public schools. I can’t tell you how many people I encounter who love reminiscing about their high school art classes. Most grown adults are quick to tell me that they still have that certain ceramic soap dish, or photo or drawing in their homes (or their mom’s home).

“Many of my fellow teachers have commented to me on what they have seen in the Varsity Arts section, always in a positive way. Your section also acts as an inspiration to my art students, who aspire to possibly get their name and/or picture in the newspaper for their artistic ability. Thank you for expanding the knowledge that high school is more than a varsity sports section in a newspaper.

“Your section shows that art is still alive and important. Our schools have become so left-brain focused that the kids are beginning to tilt. Art expands and balances the brain through the creativity the right side of the brain explores. There are a lot of bright people out there fighting for jobs. I tell my students when an employer questions who to employ given two bright people, he will most likely take the bright person who is also creative and can think outside the box. Art allows for a lot of ‘out of the box’ thinking.” – Kathleen Janiec, ceramics teacher, La Quinta High School

•••

“Varsity Arts has given our students at Saddleback High School in Santa Ana much appreciated recognition. I hate the fact that most of what is publicized about Santa Ana is negative. Your section has allowed us to highlight some of the great things that happen at (our school). Last year, you featured one of my dancers, Sharon Hernandez, as an Artist of the Week, and that was a great boon to her confidence. It was the first time one of our students had been featured, and we were very proud to have had a full page ad like that. This year, we were able to nominate Eduardo Duarte as Artist of the Year for dance.

“Thank you so much for your section, which allows us to recognize our exceptional students.” – Sandra Corr, dance advisor, Saddleback High School

•••

“It is difficult to express in words the positive impact Varsity Arts has had on our school community. It was especially effective in the Sunday paper, maybe because arts people tend to have Sunday mornings off, but I would overhear our parents and staff say that the first thing they did was find the Varsity Arts page in the Sunday paper and read it. Also, we sold many Sunday subscriptions because of the Varsity Arts page.

“The Varsity Arts section has raised arts awareness not only in Orange County, but with superintendents and principals in our school districts. I think I get a minimum of three emails for every one you send me from administration. The section has also instilled a sense of pride among teachers, schools and districts. Everyone gets so excited when their school is covered (we have six high schools). In fact, in our last VAPA coordinator meeting, we were planning an art event with a well-known artist for Westminster High School visual arts students and possibly including all district visual arts students and immediately it was asked if I thought Varsity Arts would cover such an event. I think that says a lot. In addition, the Varsity Arts page has done a great job of leveling the playing field for students coming from art rich districts and those who do not. I love the way Varsity Arts covers talent, accomplishment and passion.

“A newspaper has to speak to a diverse audience and Varsity Arts speaks to the creative, which is a significant population in Orange County.” – Diane Makas, artistic director, Huntington Beach Academy for the Performing Arts

•••

“The stories in the Varsity Arts section provide a bright, positive recognition of our many talented and dedicated students and teachers. Thank you for reporting on this important aspect of our community.” – Lou Ann Hobbs, longtime subscriber

•••

“This section of the OC Register is outstanding. It makes a huge contribution to the positive self-esteem of all the students who give of themselves in theater arts. When the students see themselves in the paper, or see their names in print, it does such wonders for them. This section is a real “shot in the arm” and validates what they are doing. Some students have a real passion for acting. The talent seen in the younger people is simply amazing.

“This section of the paper not only recognizes the students for their tremendous efforts, but it creates a public awareness of what is taking place at the Orange County high schools. There are more things happening at the high school level than sports, and this part of the paper emphasizes this point perfectly.

“I certainly hope that the Varsity Arts section of the Register remains as a regular and vital part of the paper on a weekly basis.” – Catherine McAdams-Ortiz, nurse practitioner

•••

“I am delighted to see the Register supporting the arts in the schools. We have such outstanding programs. How exciting for parents and students to receive such recognition. Please keep up the good work in Orange County by sharing student talents and their many productions.” – Martha Alves, Register reader

“When Adrian was recognized by the Register as a talented artist, I was beaming with pride. Adrian’s ability to put on paper what is in his soul is quite an honor to see.” – Rocio Lopez, parent of Adrian Lopez, a Varsity Arts Artist of the Week

•••

“When the story on Adrian Romero was featured, I felt very proud and excited to see Adrian recognized for his talent and hard work. I was contacted by several alumni who were glad to see Santa Ana High School featured in Varsity Arts. So often sports and athletics make the headlines, but Varisty Arts recognizes the variety of talents and abilities our students have to offer.” – Judi Westing, art teacher, Santa Ana High School

•••

“I am concerned that I did not receive the Varsity Arts section in my newspaper last week (when Varsity Arts moved from Tuesday to Thursday) since I look forward to this section every week. My family is very involved in high school performing arts, so it is of great interest to us. Not everyone has family members who play sports, but in our high school, over half the students are involved in some kind of visual or performing art. Given the demonstrated value of the arts in education I think it is important to acknowledge the achievements of students in this area as well as update us all on recent events. I hope you will continue to publish this section that serves such a valuable role in the lives of visual and performing arts students and their families.” – Dr. Alison Paladichuk, Register subscriber

•••

“My family and I love opening our Register paper and reading about all the young arts accomplishments in our area. These talented students are the future of what we hold as humans the highest of accomplishments – the arts! Please continue to dazzle and amaze us with your articles and pictures.” – The Simmons family, Register readers

•••

“I love Varsity Arts. Just as I love to look at how our high school sports teams are doing, I love to see what our local high schools are achieving in the arts. There is so much talent in our area and I LOVE reading about it. Both my boys played sports and have been featured in OC Varsity. Neither one has participated much in the arts but we still value attending our high school concerts, plays and comedy shows.

“Thank you OC Register for providing us with this section and letting us read about the amazing talent in the OC. This is why I have been a subscriber for over 20 years!” – Louise Deeb, Register subscriber

•••

“I find the Varsity Arts section to be spectacularly boring, a waste of paper. I gave it a chance, but I have to now admit, I set it aside with the ad sections without even a glance. I can understand why the parents of these featured children would welcome this section, but it can never generate mass appeal to the OC population.” – William Michael, Register reader

•••

“The Varsity Arts section has been AMAZING! Being a parent with students in both athletics and the arts, it is incredibly refreshing to see a regular section, just as for sports, being dedicated to the immense artistic talent and work being done. Orange County is rich in opportunities in the performing arts, and the abilities of the high school students is so impressive and also reflects the incredible training that is provided by truly selfless, amazing teachers.

“The performing arts are a very strong part of the DNA of San Juan Hills High School. Especially being a newer high school, coverage in Varsity Arts has helped to encourage San Juan Hills’ dance and theater arts students in particular by recognizing their hard work, talent and achievements on a larger scale. It also has helped to publicly establish San Juan Hills High School’s wonderful all-encompassing and college preparatory programs within Orange County. As a parent, and I know I speak for others, it is also fun to read OC Varsity Arts to see what other schools, students and programs are doing.

“My guess is that it is hard for the editor to select which items to print each week because there are so many amazing things being done by the students, teachers and programs at almost every high school. What a blessing.

“Thank you, OC Register, for seeing the value of the arts by creating this amazing section of your paper!” – Laura MacAdam, mother of dance and theater arts students, San Juan Hills High School

•••

“I never found (the Varsity Arts section to be) interesting, which is why I stopped looking at that section some time ago. I am guessing others felt the same way, which is why the comics, Dear Abby, Hints From Heloise, Watch This and the TV listings were moved there to force people to go to that section.” (Note from the Register: The comics, etc., appeared in Varsity Arts on March 5 because Food was a special section that day, highlighting Brad Johnson’s 75 Best Places to Eat.) – D. T., Register reader, Santa Ana

“I am representing VSA Orange County (formerly Very Special Arts Orange County), serving individuals with disabilities. Two years ago, a reporter and photographer were sent to our event, the annual VSA Festival, and the result was wonderful. Not only were students and teachers interviewed, an array of photos was included. This kind of positive publicity for students with special needs does several things. It validates the participants and makes them feel appreciated, and it becomes an advocacy and awareness piece for the general public. I can’t say enough about how much this meant to our teachers, students, parents and the public at large.” – Phyllis Berenbeim, consultant, visual and performing arts, Orange County Department of Education

•••

“The coverage Kaitlin Wright and photographer Sam Gangwer did on our Veterans piece on Nov. 25 gave the students a lot of exposure. I heard, as did my dancers, from people in the community, and they were very moved by the concept.

“We had attended ‘Letters Home’ at the Cerritos Performing Arts Center in preparation for the piece. One of the board members for the fine-arts-education arm of the center contacted me in response to the piece she saw in the Register. She was very excited that we were able to utilize the performance and what the students had gleaned from that experience and channel it into another art form. She was excited to be able to see a video tape of the performance. We are still working on trying to get one as there are so many copyright issues with music that we have not been able to get a recording of one of the performances yet. We may end up filming it here at school just to be able to share it with the Cerritos Performing Arts Center for their Creative Expressions Projects that they utilize to help document how their performances have impact in the classroom. Thanks to the piece in the OC Register they were excited that a dance had come out of one of their offerings.

‘Any exposure of what our dance company is doing is always a blessing. The performing arts side of dance sometimes gets lost in the hyper-competitive world of dance teams and competition studios. Its wonderful that the value of dance education can also be celebrated as just a performing art too. It make a difference to the dancers, audiences and wider community at large.” – Sue Gehringer, director of dance, Esperanza High School

•••

“The Sunny Hills High School Conservatory of the Fine Arts (COFA) greatly appreciates the Varsity Arts section of the Register. Showcasing the amazing artistic talents of Sunny Hills students helps us build enthusiasm for the arts on our campus and provides a great sense of pride for our featured artists and teachers. When one of our students is featured in the Varsity Arts section, we post it on our social media pages, our website and around the campus, which helps build interest in the arts as well as pride within the programs.” – Allen Whitten, principal, Sunny Hills High School

“The Varsity Arts section of the newspaper has brought an exposure for the arts in Orange County that had been lacking. Many more people are now aware of what is happening in the arts in our schools because of your newspaper.” – Eric Graham, vocal music teacher, Marina High School

•••

“I believe your Varsity Arts section is an amazing addition to your newspaper. So often the only high school students that are featured are the outstanding athletes and sports stories. This section showcasing talented young people is a terrific opportunity for the community to be aware of them and the time and energy they put into their passions.” – Gretchen Lee, Register reader

“The Varsity Arts section as well as the high school sports section are the ones I skip. I think sports should be in the sports section and the arts should be in whatever the entertainment section is called. This morning I couldn’t find the last section of the paper because I set aside the Varsity Arts section. Quit changing the names of sections. Mostly old people take the paper. We don’t want to search around for things.” –A. Miller, Register reader

“The coverage and recognition The Wooden Floor’s young artists have received via the OC Register’s Varsity Arts section has validated them as bonafide artists and valued contributors to the discourse of the contemporary dance world. Our dancers exemplify the breaking down of socioeconomic barriers present in the ability to make art. Varsity Arts continues to allow our students to have a voice, to be seen and to know that they and their art-making matters.” – Payal Kumar Avellan, director of communications and marketing, The Wooden Floor

“Thank you so much for the Varsity Arts section of the Register. I have two daughters at Laguna Hills High School, one is in the chamber choir and the other is in drama. I can tell you that over the past couple years, we anxiously await the Varsity Art section to see reports of the exploits of the students at Laguna Hills.” – Mark Hall, Register reader

“Varsity Arts has helped change the paradigm of the arts in Orange County which are frequently overlooked in favor of other high school preoccupations like sports and SATs by bringing it to the front and opening a dialogue about the importance of arts education. Having an outlet to share their hard work with the community is valuable for my students and gives them something to strive for.” – Patrick Williams, animation teacher, Orange County School of the Arts

“From my own personal perspective, I have enjoyed looking at my program in a different light to see if there is more that I can be doing to foster artistry here at Mater Dei. I love reading the articles about the other programs and seeing what they are all doing.

“In addition, I have received a great response from alumni and parents who have noticed our inclusion in the section. Even when there is a little blurb, I get emails and calls and so I am very appreciative of this.

“Do you know if there will be a solid day that they will publish Varsity Arts? I know that Sunday was a premium spot, but I had a much greater number of people mentioning it when it was on Sunday. It’s more of a surprise if they stumble on it now.” – Scott Melvin, director of choral music, Mater Dei High School

“I want you to know that I am constantly reading the Varsity Arts section and love that it is a place in the newspaper for young artists and athletes to display their talents. I believe it is a great way to see what other programs are doing and stay up to date on the local young artists community.” – Jamie Tanzer, dance director, Sunny Hills High School

“The Artist of the Year program is a wonderful way to encourage work ethic and commitment of future generation of theater students. In all our programs within our performing arts department, the underclassmen were impressed and inspired by the students we chose as nominees. We announced our nominees at our big showcase assembly in front of all of Mater Dei’s students and had a reception line including our school principal, president and arts teachers shaking their hands in a very ceremonially style. In the classroom, we showed their resumes and submission material to the beginning classes. The theater arts classes were impressed by our two nominee when they saw their resumes projected on the screen in classroom. I ended the presentation with, ‘Just think –keep working hard and improving your skills, perhaps one day you could be our nominee for Artist of the Year.’

“Last year, after helping our nominee write his resume it became obvious that we weren’t preparing our students well enough to document their experience in resume style. We taught it for a week and gave assignments. It is awesome to know our juniors and seniors have a resume ready to print at any moment to send to an admissions office.

“And we like the listings of awards at local and state competitions and festivals. It helps us promote our program.” – Patrick Williams, director of performing arts, Mater Dei High School

“The Varsity Arts section has had an impact on me, our group of volunteer parents in the arts and our upper school students because it has raised awareness of the amazing arts programs in the region. We get a weekly glimpse into the learning and active engagement in the arts that is going on in numerous schools.

“I value the insights into the experiences that students have in all variety of schools as they develop their skills in the visual arts or performing art classes or extra-curricular experiences. I am inspired by their talent and dedication to their pursuits. (The) feature on the grade 12 harpist who performed at the Grammys is representative of the types of articles that the section provides. I am blown away by the talent and what these young artists are doing!

“As a Cappies mentor, I can add that having the theater reviews published is very impactful. The array of reviews from all kinds of dramatic performances helps readers understand the many pieces that go into a theatrical production. For the trained critics who attend and review the productions, they have a clearer audience for their writing and can easily learn how other productions were received by other critics.” – Michele Silverman, production manager for the arts, St. Margaret’s Episcopal School

“The Varsity Arts has created a wonderful place where readers and artists can come together to celebrate the arts. This platform has provided immeasurable awareness for the arts in our community and district. It is truly wonderful to have programs featured and for students to get the attention they so richly deserve. We applaud the Register for their inexhaustible generosity and unwavering support of our programs!” – Daina Anderson, visual arts teacher, Westminster High School

“All of our students and instructors strive to be the best in every performance. Being covered in the Varsity Arts section and Yorba Linda Star Sections of the Orange County Register is just icing on the cake that encourages everyone to always put their best foot forward. It adds pride and that shines through in every performance that they do. It would be nice to see more of the performing arts competitions and performances covered throughout the year in the Varsity Section of the OC Register and in the Yorba Linda Star. Yorba Linda High School hosts a Marching Band Field Show Competition in Bradford Stadium in October, and it would be nice to have coverage to help gain community support and to promote the many talented students that perform during this event.” – Sharon Peterson, marching band parent, Yorba Linda High School

“As a parent who grew up in O.C., I have always relied on the Register for coverage of local high school sports. The Varsity Arts section adds the ‘right stuff’ to the story of all the GOOD that happens in youth today.

“As a music teacher of 30 years, it is wonderful to see the paper take this on. So much good happening in the arts, thanks for telling the story. I hope the articles continue without the need of ‘competition results’ as these do not define the artist or program alone.” – Robert Avzaradel, music teacher, Irvine High School

“The Varsity Arts section shows the Register’s commitment in highlighting student achievement. I love that the arts are held in such high regard. I’m checking out each issue always looking for El Toro’s great talent.” – Maria Nadal, art teacher, El Toro High School

“Varsity Arts has a great impact on students in the Yorba Linda High School program. When they see their peers or program being recognized, it promotes school pride. It is not very often that the students that spend endless hours practicing, attending zero period and weekend performances get recognition that is so deserving of all their hard work. As for (our music) program, it makes the program more desirable and popular. It gives those students that are considering music in high school the opportunity to see what different programs do and the opportunities that are available at the high school level.

“Varsity Arts also gives the general public a peek into the great programs at our local high schools. Our society puts a great emphasis on sports and has dedicated an entire section of the newspaper to it. When I first saw a copy of Varsity Arts, I thought to myself, ‘Finally!’

“I am glad that the Register values the arts and I hope that they continue to provide this breath of fresh air in our newspaper.” – Ligia Alvarado-Stowell, band parent, Yorba Linda High School

“Thank you Varsity Arts for providing an opportunity to celebrate students’ art with staff, visitors, parents and the whole greater community of Orange County.

“Varsity Arts generates excitement among the students as it expands their audience to the greater community of Orange County and other schools. Having a display copy of the publication in the hallway promotes appreciation of the work of others and an opportunity to learn and commend each other on achieving an honor. This definitely influences the students and the work they do, nurturing empathy, respect and a strong sense of community.

“Thank you for making art relevant and bringing clarity to the arts!” – Regina Stehney, fine-arts and photography teacher, JSerra Catholic High School

“I would like to let you know how much I enjoy reading the Varsity Arts section in the Register. It is so nice to learn about all of the students in the Orange County area that strive to obtain a high level of the art they participate in. These students work so hard to develop their talent, and it is great that the Register acknowledges their hard work and dedication. With the high attention given to the athletes in the area, it is wonderful that students are now recognized for their talents in the arts.

“I was thrilled when my son Eric Wambold was featured in an article as Artist of the Week in January 2015. His hard work while participating as a Herald Trumpet for the Pasadena Rose Parade Band was acknowledged. It will be something his family will always remember!” – Patty Wambold, Register reader

“Thank you for helping to recognize the talent and training that these great students receive. As adults, we know that recognition for a job ‘well done’ is often more important than money, and if important to adults then even more important to our youth when they are learning skills and attitudes that will affect them for life.

“Your recognition is key to building the confidence needed for success in life.” – Wayne Odekirk, president, Childress M.A.C.Y Awards
