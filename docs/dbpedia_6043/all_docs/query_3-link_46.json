        "text": "Thanks to our sales teams around the world, whenever consumers want a Red Bull, a can is close at hand. Single cans and multi-packs are merchandised and sold in supermarkets, convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, bars, e-commerce sites, and at some unexpected locations too, including hotels, festivals, and specialty retailers. Red Bull sales teams are channel-oriented and organized into Off Premise (retailers, where the product is consumed later) and On Premise (hospitality venues, where the can is opened and enjoyed immediately). Fun fact: did you know that the first Red Bull sold was here in Salzburg in a local On Premise account? With experts in the areas of Key Accounts, Field Sales, Distribution, Category Management, Insights and Trade Marketing, our sales teams work collaboratively across business channels to build customer partnerships, secure availability and brand presence, and drive maximum consumer impact. Our sales teams maximize the steady profits that keep the entire company strong and growing.\n\nInternship Roles\n\nRed Bull’s mission is clear, we Give Wings to People and Ideas. Global, national, and local marketing teams in over 170 countries around the world accomplish this in unique ways. We inspire, encourage, challenge and empower people to make the most of their time and talent to bring the best ideas to life. Since 1987, Red Bull has continually captured the world’s attention with 'beyond the ordinary' initiatives, events and projects including Red Bull Flugtag, Red Bull Stratos, Red Bull BC One, Red Bull Cliff Diving and countless others. Red Bull marketing teams are specialized in the areas of Sports (Events, Athletes), Culture (Dance, Music), Brand (Advertising, Consumer Activations, Consumer Insights, Consumer Collecting and Field Marketing, Product Initiatives), and Media (Communications/Earned, Content Development and Production, Managed and Owned). Often, our Field Marketing teams support initiatives in all of these areas; they work closely, both internally as a unit and cross-functionally with sales teams, to create the best consumer experiences around our brand and products as well as media projects.\n\nInternship Roles\n\nThe operations team plans and executes the production, transportation and delivery of our product around the world to meet the demand of our customers and ensure the highest quality standards within every can of Red Bull. The process begins with the Product Innovation team, developing and introducing the products consumers want most. It continues with Planning, the team responsible for supply and inventory management, including raw materials, packaging, produced beverages and POS materials. Our Procurement team sources everything needed to produce our premium beverages packaging and POS while Production is responsible for mixing, filling and packaging the beverage. Fresh and ready-to-drink cans are delivered through the entire distribution channel, to all point-of-sale outlets thanks to our Logistics team. Through it all, our Quality team assures the quality of the product by managing specifications, compliance and certifications at every point in the process. Operations works tirelessly with the most advanced systems and technology to ensure every single time a consumer searches for, purchases, and opens a can of Red Bull, they enjoy an optimal product experience.\n\nInternship Roles\n\nThe mission of our media teams is to create and program unique and authentic content that inspires and engages our consumers – and keeps them coming back for more. Through our seasoned approach to storytelling, our teams at Red Bull Media House within Media Network, ServusTV, Terra Mater, Publishing and Benevento showcase the world of Red Bull. Media teams develop, produce, and commission original, 'beyond the ordinary' stories across a wide range of formats, including events, live-broadcast, social media, audio media, print and online magazines, television, short and long-format programming, as well as documentaries and feature films from around the world. Our teams then program the content to reach our audience across our network of owned and managed channels – from digital platforms to traditional television networks and editorial media partners. Media teams work cross-functionally to build and develop digital products, ensure smooth technical executions and a world-class user journey, realize media sales opportunities and cross-platform promotions, in order to bring to life a ‘beyond the ordinary' consumer experience.\n\nInternship Roles\n\nTo support Red Bull's global business, IT drives automation, collaboration and decision-making based on business insights. Strategic IT functions such as concepts, architecture, management and standards, are managed internally whereas other IT functions (development, operations, support) are either outsourced or automated. Media Technology teams work across the entire digital media supply chain and technology stack to facilitate the streaming and storage of content, the management of digital rights and its technical infrastructure, to support the vision of bringing content to life. A dynamic, digital environment allows us to achieve our goals while being challenged and enriched by the diverse nature of our international organization.\n\nInternship Roles\n\nThe HR team enables Red Bull to hire, develop and grow the right people. This means supporting managers and teams with the right resources and work environment to be creative, develop individual strengths, work collaboratively and achieve the best possible results. Global HR teams include HR Information Systems, Talent Management and Compensation & Benefits while our Austria HR team includes Talent Acquisition, Business Partnering, Payroll and an HR Shared Service Center to ensure all headquarter employees are supported.\n\nInternship Roles\n\nThe Fashion & FanWear teams are responsible for an extensive product portfolio led by the premium fashion brand AlphaTauri and Red Bull Energy Wear, which includes the Official Red Bull Athletes Collection and a large range of Red Bull FanWear for Red Bull Racing, RB Leipzig, Red Bull BC One and many more. The team manages various brand extension programs, creating further dimensions of the Red Bull brand. They are committed to establishing business and driving innovation across product design, development, marketing, and distribution, including e-commerce.\n\nInternship Roles\n\nData and analytics teams throughout the organization support our various departments by identifying useful internal and external, structured and unstructured data sources. The consistent delivery of high-quality data is ensured by the implementation of rigorous Data Quality Management standards and processes. Additionally, the teams ensure the data is properly modeled and provide state-of-the-art decision support by applying data science and machine learning, including purpose-built and trained artificial intelligence applications. Data and analytics teams help ensure our insights and data have the highest possible impact throughout the company by designing relevant, advanced reporting solutions.\n\nInternship Roles"
