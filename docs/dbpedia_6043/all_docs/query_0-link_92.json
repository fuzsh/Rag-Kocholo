Brown about his upcoming book The Black Butterfly: The Harmful Politics of Race and Space in America. In The Black Butterfly—a reference to the fact that Baltimore’s majority-Black population spreads out on both sides of the coveted strip of real estate running down the center of the city like a butterfly’s wings—Lawrence T. Brown reveals that ongoing historical trauma caused by a combination of policies, practices, systems, and budgets is at the root of uprisings and crises in hypersegregated cities around the country. Drawing on social science research, policy analysis, and archival materials, Brown reveals the long history of racial segregation’s impact on health, from toxic pollution to police brutality. In his book and this conversation, Lawrence T. Brown offers a clear five-step plan for activists, nonprofits, and public officials to achieve racial equity. Not content to simply describe and decry urban problems, Brown offers up a wide range of innovative solutions to help heal and restore redlined Black neighborhoods, including municipal reparations. He argues that, since urban apartheid was intentionally erected, it can be intentionally dismantled, The Black Butterfly demonstrates that America cannot reflect that Black lives matter until we see how Black neighborhoods matter. Following his presentation, he will answer questions from the moderator and the attendees.\n\nHosted by America Walks.\n\nTitle: Collaboration in a Virtual Environment peer learning session\n\nPresenters: Karen DiBari, Conservation Connect Director; Ben Irey, Conservation Connect Program Manager; and Sarah Di Vittorio, Northern California Program Manager.\n\nDate and Time: October 8th at 3PM EDT\n\nOverview: Hear lessons learned in virtual facilitation and collaboration from National Forest Foundation staff who have been facilitating collaborative groups during COVID-19; gain an understanding of practices to implement for successful virtual engagement; have the opportunity to ask questions of the panelists and share your own tips for effective virtual collaboration.\n\nHosted by National Forest Foundation.\n\nTitle: Reconnecting Children with Nature: Our Responsibility and Our Opportunity\n\nPresenters: Jack Voelker\n\nDate and Time: October 8th at 1-2:30PM EDT\n\nOverview: Learn about successful strategies from recreation and parks professionals that address the disconnect from nature through facility and land use planning, program development, and community education and partnerships.\n\nHosted by American Trails.\n\nTitle: Latinxhikers Fireside Chat\n\nPresenters: Alexandra Garcia, Adriana Garcia (Co-founder Latinxhikers), and Angie Vasquez (Founder of Girls Who Hike FL); hosted by Luz Lituma, Co-founder of Latinxhikers and FTA & ATC Latinx Partnerships Coordinator.\n\nDate and Time: October 6th at 5PM EDT\n\nOverview: In celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, the ATC and FTA have invited a few powerful women to be part of their Virtual Latinxhikers Fireside Chat.

The reasons behind such trail etiquette are rooted in animal psychology and behavior. Yet many stewardship volunteers, including hikers, trail runners, backpackers and mountain bicyclists are unfamiliar with the reasons why horses and mules might react adversely when thrust into a surprise encounter. This webinar will provide participants with useful information on ways to minimize trail conflict and how to work comfortably alongside packstock during stewardship projects. The presenters will walk webinar participants through topics such as:\n\nThe benefits of incorporating users of packstock, which includes horses and mules, into trial work parties and stewardship projects.\n\nHorse psychology, including:\n\nHorse sense: How a horse interprets its world through sight, sound and smell.\n\nFears and concerns of a prey animal (from the eyes of the horse).\n\nFight or flight: Why even a well-trained horse might occasionally “bolt.”\n\nHow to “read” a horse’s state of mind (pro tip: Vulcan mind-meld not required!).\n\nTrail and weather characteristics that serve to minimize surprise encounters with pack and saddle stock.\n\nFears and concerns of the horseback rider.\n\nBest practices to minimize your anxiety or fear, or that of others in your party, when encountering stock on the trail or during joint stewardship projects.\n\nHorse poop (aka, manure): Is it something to fear?\n\nThe webinar will be interactive, in order to recognize the accumulated experience of webinar participants, with ample time for audience Q&A or story-telling. We implore participants to help us craft an informative webinar, the recording of which can serve as an educational tool for trail users and professionals for years to come.\n\nHosted by the National Wilderness Stewardship Alliance.\n\nTitle: Upswell Pop-Up #5 – Exploring Anti-Racism and COVID-19 Recovery Strategies\n\nPresenter: Independent Sector\n\nDate and Time: August 11th at 1PM EDT\n\nOverview: We’ll be exploring anti-racism and COVID-19 recovery strategies using new, intimate approaches – creatively engineered, carefully facilitated, and designed to make a difference.\n\nHosted by the Independent Sector.\n\nTitle: The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and Sustainable Tourism in the Ohio River Valley\n\nPresenter: Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail\n\nDate and Time: August 6th at 1:30PM EDT\n\nOverview: With the 1,200-mile extension of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail in May 2019, a fourth major North American river became an official part of the Trail – the Ohio River, joining the Mississippi, Missouri, and Columbia Rivers. Beginning at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Ohio is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. It ends 981 miles later at Cairo, Illinois when it empties into the Mississippi. The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Experience project is designed to support the public’s use and enjoyment of The Trail without adversely impacting the resources along it. This Geotourism project engages residents, enterprises, communities, and visitors in shared environmental and cultural heritage stewardship. The National Park Service has built a new travel website –https://lewisandclark.travel/ — specifically designed to bring together businesses like yours (attractions, landmarks, and other points of interest) to help promote sustainable tourism. We are working with the Ohio River Recreational Trail to garner as big a following as possible in and around the Ohio River in Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio. The second component of the webinar is to focus on state resources to develop tourism infrastructure of river towns. It will focus on the value of being designated as a trail town by your state. Kentucky’s designated Trail Towns put you near the best outdoor sites in the state, including hundreds of miles of trails, woods and waters but keep you in cities and towns offering hotels, restaurants, attractions, entertainment and other conveniences to round out your stay. To be a certified Kentucky Trail Town, these popular destinations have made a commitment to share their area’s outdoor opportunities, culture, history and stories to visitors hungry for adventure. Since its inception, this program under the state’s Tourism, Arts & Heritage Cabinet has designated 20 communities across Kentucky to serve as official gateways.\n\nHosted by the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.\n\nTitle: Trail Analytics and Data Storytelling\n\nPresenter: Emily Duchon, Principal, Alta Planning + Design; Deven Young, Principal, Alta Planning + Design; Lauren Cencic, Sr. Director, Countywide Planning & Development, Mobility Corridors, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Mike Sellinger, Associate, Alta Planning + Design\n\nDate and Time: August 6th at 1-2:30PM EDT\n\nOverview: This webinar will share a spectrum of data analysis and scenario planning tools that can be used to help plan and design new or existing trails.\n\nHosted by American Trails.\n\nTitle: Partnering with Tribes on Conservation\n\nPresenter: Jennifer Talken-Spaulding, Acting NPS American Indian Liaison\n\nDate and Time: August 5th at 3PM EDT\n\nHosted by the National Park Service as part of the Connected Conservation webinar series.\n\nTitle: “Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities” – A Conversation with author Andre Perry\n\nPresenter: Andre M.

If so, you’re not alone. Nonprofit HR recognizes that organizations need time to unpack the many issues stemming from injustices based on race, ethnicity and beyond. We have curated a specific program to help the social sector navigate through this space! Why is this necessary? Nationwide, civil unrest and renewed demands for racial equality have created new opportunities for organizations to thoroughly assess their approach to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. Race is already a challenging topic for any workforce to thoroughly dismantle and discuss. Having those discussions as the nation is still recovering from the blows of COVID-19 makes it even more challenging. We will discuss: Nonprofit HR’s latest diversity practices reporting and key findings you should know now; how the recent protests and their impact on organizations are shaping our knowledge practices and sector-reporting; how these data can be used to better galvanize your organization’s readiness to convene necessary conversations on race; critical steps needed to talk about race in the workplace.\n\nHosted by Nonprofit HR.\n\nTitle: Sustainable Advantage: Outdoor Recreation and Rural Community Development in California\n\nPresenter: Chuck Flink, Owner, Greenways Incorporated; Kim Greendahl, Greenway Specialist, City of Grand Forks, North Dakota; Cathy Ruff, Director, Charleston County Greenbelt Program\n\nDate and Time: June 30th at 1PM EDT\n\nOverview: This webinar will summarize the main findings from multiple interviews on the dynamics with state and local stakeholders in government, business, and nonprofit who work in rural communities on outdoor recreation.\n\nHosted by American Trails.\n\nTitle: The Greenway Imperative: A Call to Action\n\nPresenters: Aaron Wilcher, Independent Researcher; Fran Doherty, Independent Researcher\n\nDate and Time: June 25th at 1-2:30PM EDT\n\nOverview: The impact of COVID-19 has heightened the role that greenways and conserved greenspace play in providing critically important outdoor space for human activity, while at the same time promoting public health, safety, and well-being.\n\nHosted by American Trails.\n\nTitle: Tribal Transportation Planning and Pedestrian Safety\n\nPresenters: America Walks and partners from the tribal community planning world\n\nDate and Time: June 23rd at 3-4:15PM EDT\n\nOverview: This webinar will ask why pedestrian fatalities are so prevalent in tribal communities. American Indians and Alaska Natives are much more likely to be killed while walking than any other racial or ethnic group with a recorded pedestrian death rate almost five times the national average. And these shocking statistics probably understate the true disparity because of a fragmented reporting system. Webinar panelists representing government agencies, research organizations, and the communities of Pueblo of Laguna and Yakama Nation will provide an overview of the pedestrian fatality/injury data and explore potential solutions to this problem. Participants will learn how cultural heritage, communication challenges, and jurisdictional issues involving tribal, state, and federal governments have contributed to pedestrian fatalities, and presenters will discuss case studies in which collaboration, a unified advocacy voice, and safety campaigns are starting to improve outcomes. This webinar will also provide important background information for the second webinar in the Walking Towards Justice in Indian Country series on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which is scheduled for August.\n\nHosted by America Walks.\n\nTitle: COVID-19 and Field Work Learning Session\n\nPresenters: Kevin Shuck, Director of Operations, Wildland Restoration Volunteers; George Grygar, Program Operations Director, American Conservation Experience; Meryl Harrell, Executive Director, Southern Appalachian Wilderness Stewards\n\nDate and Time: June 18th at 3-4:30PM EDT\n\nOverview: Hear and share experiences and adaptations from the first few weeks working on field-based projects during the pandemic.
