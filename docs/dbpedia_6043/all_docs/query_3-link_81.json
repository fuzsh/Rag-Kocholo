        "text": "For the seniors of the Class of 2021, it was a school year unlike any other.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic prompted a shutdown of Minnesota school buildings in the spring of their junior year. In the fall, some students stayed with online learning. Some were offered a hybrid schedule that mixed online with in-person instruction, altered for social distancing. Schedules changed throughout the year, as coronavirus infections rose and fell.\n\nMasks were worn. Extracurricular activities were reduced. Social events were canceled. Families celebrated holidays via Facetime and Zoom.\n\nSo our annual salute to academic achievers in east metro and western Wisconsin high schools comes with extra plaudits this year — for persevering and adapting. And it includes a special shout-out to the educators who made it happen. They worked long hours to reach students at a distance and reconfigure classroom spaces.\n\nMore than 85 schools responded to our invitation to honor their Top Graduates. Some sent lists of names, others offered information about the students’ parents and college plans.\n\nSome asked their students to choose a quote that inspires them, and the students’ choices ranged from public figures and saints to musicians, movie and television characters, and authors.\n\nOne student’s snippet from “A Very Bad Beginning,” one of Daniel Handler’s Lemony Snicket books, might best sum up the year:\n\n“At times the world may seem like an unfriendly and sinister place, but believe that there is much more good in it than bad. All you have to do is look hard enough and what might seem to be a series of unfortunate events may in fact be the first steps of a journey.”\n\nOn that journey, we wish them well.\n\nCompiled by Deb Mazzocco, a former Pioneer Press team leader.\n\nAFSA, Vadnais Heights\n\nHannah Terry\n\nParents: Peter and Wendy Terry\n\nCollege, major: Knox College, Galesburg, Ill.; biochemistry\n\nQuote: “Sometimes the best way to solve your problems is to help someone else.” — Uncle Iroh, “Avatar: The Last Airbender”\n\nAlexi Landretti\n\nParents: John Landretti and Josee Huard\n\nCollege: St. Paul College\n\nQuote: “There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ‘good job.’ ” — Terence Fletcher, “Whiplash”\n\nWilliam Walstrom\n\nParents: Tim and Amy Walstrom\n\nCollege, major: University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Carlson School of Management\n\nJonas Asplund\n\nParents: James and Susan Asplund\n\nCollege, major: University of St. Thomas, actuarial science\n\nQuote: “It’s more important to master the cards you’re holding than to complain about the ones your opponents were dealt.” — Grimsley, “Pokemon Black and White”\n\nXavier Satre\n\nParents: Ryan and Karen Satre\n\nCollege, major: Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, Fla.; mechanical engineering\n\nQuote: “Men always make gods in their own image.” — Xenophanes\n\nJoseph Fisher\n\nParents: Mark Fisher and Susan O’Neill Fisher\n\nCollege, major: University of Minnesota, forestry\n\nQuote: “You can wear flannel to any occasion, the only hard part is finding the right one.”\n\nAlexander Tupper\n\nParents: William and Julie Tupper\n\nCollege, major: University of Montana, Bozeman; environmental design\n\nQuote: “And it’s all downhill from here.”\n\nElijah Myers\n\nParents: Jeremy and Tracie Myers\n\nCollege: Northland College, Ashland, Wis.\n\nQuote: “I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs.
