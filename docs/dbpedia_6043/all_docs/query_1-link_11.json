Volkswagen was beginning to regain its prominence as a foreign automaker by differentiating both the buying and ownership experiences. Unfortunately, as the SQ strategy was taking shape, VW’s CEO lost his life in the Pan Am crash over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n\nVolvo Motors North America\n\nKarl and members of the KAI consulting team facilitated a strategy retreat for Volvo’s senior management and key dealer executives, aimed at strengthening the brand identity in North America, as well as focusing more strongly on the key value factors known to be important to Volvo’s unique customer population. Results of the retreat included a review of competitive standing; identification of key strengths and weaknesses; a best practices harvest; and an action plan for regaining brand status and competitive position.\n\nWestpac Bank, Australia\n\nKarl presented a full-day seminar for Westpac’s management team, focused on meeting the strategic challenges in the finance industry, and applying the service management model to improve service quality in all aspects of the organization. He assisted them in reviewing the prevalent quality models, and showed how to achieve a focus on outstanding client service by applying the methods of service management as outlined in his best-selling book Service America: Doing Business in the New Economy.\n\nYukon Territory Government.\n\nKAI’s senior consultant Don Mizaur advised and assisted a major logistical department of Canada’s Yukon Territory in a comprehensive review of performance; conducted interviews and surveys to determine the state of the operation and its culture; recommended key priorities to the TMT and advised them on implementation.
