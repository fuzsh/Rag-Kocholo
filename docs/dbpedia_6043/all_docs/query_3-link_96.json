Orr grapples with the balance and discord that exists at the heart of relations between the human spirit, art and nature. Orr is a performance artist crossing between performances for live audiences and performances for the camera. She has produced iconic images reflecting an Australian perspective.\n\nJill has presented works in Australia and internationally since the late 1970’s and is regularly invited to exhibit in international curated exhibitions and events. She was represented in the inaugural Venice International Performance Art Week in 2012. She was awarded an Australia Council Fellowship to produce Antipodean Epic from 2015-17. Commissioned works between 2018 and 2019 include Detritus Springs, Listen, Laundry, and Dark Night. In 2020-2021, Jill was represented in Australia: Antipodean Stories at PAC Padiglione d’Art Contemporanea, Milan, curated by Eugenio Viola. This Tree was commissioned for MUMA’s 2021-2, Tree Story. Jill was represented in Know My Name: Australian Women Artists 1900 to Now at the National Gallery of Australia and is represented by This is No Fantasy who presented Mitre Lake at Art Basel and Melbourne 2022. In 2024, Orr exhibited The Promised Land Refigured at Linden New Art for Photo24.\n\nAreas of expertise\n\nPerformance Art\n\nSite Specific Performance\n\nPhotography, video and physical theatre\n\nPainting\n\nPsycho-social issues surrounding environmental and place based works\n\nEphemeral works\n\nDocumentation\n\nInstallation\n\nCollaboration\n\nResearch interests\n\nSpace, Place and Recurring History are areas through which practice led research enables, articulates and deepens relations to places that have been impacted through colonization, cultural, social, historical and environmental forces.\n\nSite specific works give voice to places, spaces and environments as living entities through which human and non-human interactivity are central in grounded artistic responses. Jill Orr places emphasis on the artistic imaginary which, when in constant focus, enables visualisation of the past, present and future as fluid and porous over time. Her interest in an empathetic and poetic performativity that can sustainably compliment interdisciplinary work through expanded artistic fields, is constantly evolving.\n\nSupervision\n\nFive PhD supervisions completed\n\nThree PhD's currently ongoing\n\nEight Masters supervisions completed\n\nTwo Masters supervisions ongoing\n\nEighteen Honours completed\n\nOne Honours supervision ongoing\n\nPublications\n\nExhibitions and performances\n\nJuried/curated group and solo exhibitions (last 10 yrs)\n\n2024 The Promised Land Refigured, Linden New Art, for Photo 24.\n\n2023 Ravenswood Women’s Art Prize, 2023, Finalist and Highly Commended.\n\n2023 Ingredients for a Precarious Meal, This is No Fantasy Group Show , May-June 2023.\n\n2023 Performing the Archive in Leisa Shelton’s Archiving the Ephemeral at the Abbotsford Convent with Stelarc and myself.\n\n2022 Beating About the Bush: A New Lens on Australian Impressionism, Art Gallery of Ballarat.\n\n2022 Southern Cross Reclaimed, This is No Fantasy is Dianne Tanzer and Nicola Stein, 108-110 Gertrude St, Fitzroy, VIC.\n\n2022 Falling and Flight, Southern Western, Mildura Art Centre, curated by Gareth Hart and Jane Polkinghorne.\n\n2022 Southern Cross Reclaimed, This is No Fantasy, is Dianne Tanzer and Nicola Stein for Art Basel online from Feb 9th – Feb 12th 2022.\n\n2021-22 Exhume the Grave – McCubbin and Contemporary Art, Geelong Gallery curated by Lisa Sullivan.\n\n2021 This Tree, Tree Story, Monash Museum of Art, curated and commissioned by Charlotte Day.\n\n2020-21 Know My Name, National Gallery of Australia.\n\n2020 Australia: Antipodean Stories at PAC Padiglione d’Art Contemporanea, Milan curated by Eugenio Viola.\n\n2019 Dark Night, performance for Dance Massive, produced by Dancehouse at the Abbotsford Convent South Laundry.\n\n2019 Laundry, performance for Temporal Proximities, curated by Kelli Alred at the Abottsford Convent South Laundry.\n\n2018 Listening, Unconformity Festival, Queenstown Tasmania.\n\n2018 Detritus Springs, Biennale of Australian Art, curated by Julie Collins.\n\n2018 Chaos and Order: 120 Years of collecting at RMIT, curated by Jon Buckingham,\n\n2018 Dark Night, performance commissioned for the Lorne Sculpture Biennale 2018 opening weekend.
