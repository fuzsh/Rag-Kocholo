Using a baboon model, we found hundreds of eQTLs that emerge in adipose, liver, and muscle after prolonged exposure to high dietary fat and cholesterol. Diet-responsive eQTLs exhibit genomic localization and genic features that are distinct from steady-state eQTLs. Furthermore, the human orthologs associated with diet-responsive eQTLs are enriched for GWAS genes associated with human metabolic traits, suggesting that context-responsive eQTLs with more complex regulatory effects are likely to explain GWAS hits that do not seem to overlap with standard eQTLs. Our results highlight the complexity of genetic regulatory effects and the potential of eQTLs with disease-relevant GxE interactions in enhancing the understanding of GWAS signals for human complex disease using non-human primate models.\n\nKeywords: baboon, diet effect, high fat, high cholesterol, response eQTL, GxE interaction, eQTL enrichment, metabolic disease, sex difference, nonhuman primate model\n\nHighlights\n\n•\n\nTwo-year diet intervention and transcriptomic profiling from 99 captive baboons\n\n•\n\nDynamic complexity of genetic regulatory effects in response to diet across tissues\n\n•\n\nDistinct regulatory landscape of diet-responsive eQTLs from steady-state eQTLs\n\n•\n\nEnrichment of baboon diet-responsive eQTLs in human GWAS genes for metabolic traits\n\nLin et al. characterized transcriptional and gene regulatory responses to high dietary fat and cholesterol in three metabolically active tissues in a longitudinal study of baboons. They highlight the intricate and dynamic interplay between diet, genetic variants, and gene expression. The results illustrate the potential of GxE eQTL studies in non-human primates to advance the understanding of the role of non-coding variants in human complex disease.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous non-coding loci that are associated with complex traits and diseases.1 These loci are thought to modulate disease risk by regulating gene expression, yet only about 40%–50% of non-coding GWAS hits are explained by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).2,3,4,5,6 The majority of eQTLs have been discovered from healthy adult tissues in an unperturbed state, known as standard eQTLs.7 However, eQTL effects can vary across different environmental contexts, such as tissue types,7 cell states,8 developmental stages,9 and external perturbations.10 Our ability to explain GWAS signals could be improved by expanding the scope of eQTL studies to account for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions.\n\nMetabolic traits are highly influenced by environmental factors, particularly diet. For example, high-fat diets have been associated with dysregulation of lipid metabolism, leading to increased adiposity and the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.11,12 Investigating the intricate interplay between genetics and diet is essential to advance our understanding of metabolic health and develop effective strategies for disease prevention and management.\n\nHowever, studying gene-by-diet interactions in humans is challenging due to the practical limitations of performing long-term diet interventions and the restricted availability of living tissue samples. Rodent models can be used to circumvent these challenges, but due to genetic and biological differences, it is often difficult to translate results from rodents to humans, especially when GxE interactions are involved. In contrast, non-human primates share a striking genetic and physiological resemblance to humans, and their larger size permits collection of multiple tissue samples throughout the lifespan, facilitating longitudinal studies. The complex social interactions and structure of baboon colonies and a growing suite of baboon genetic resources have made baboons one of the preferred primate models for genetic studies of complex traits.13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 Baboons are particularly well suited for studying metabolic disorders, as human lipid metabolism is more strongly correlated with that of baboons than with lipid metabolism in other Old World monkeys such as rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, or vervet monkeys.21 Indeed, plasma cholesterol concentrations in baboons respond to dietary cholesterol and fat intake in a similar manner to humans.22 In this study, we explored gene-by-diet effects on gene regulation in vivo in a longitudinal study of baboons.\n\nResults\n\nModeling gene-by-diet interactions in baboons\n\nWe obtained adipose, liver, and muscle tissue samples from 99 sexually mature captive baboons (57 male, 42 female) on a standard low-cholesterol, low-fat (LCLF) diet ( A; Table S1). After a 2-year period of feeding the baboons a high-cholesterol, high-fat (HCHF) diet (Table S1), we collected a second set of samples from the same donors and tissues ( A). We used RNA sequencing to obtain transcriptomic profiles for each tissue sample. We recorded extensive metadata at every stage of sample collection and processing (Table S2). To confirm the tissue source of each sample, we computationally inferred cell-type composition in each sample based on gene expression signatures23 ( B). Following rigorous quality control and filtering, we retained data from a total of 570 samples and 20,224 genes for downstream analyses (Figures S1 and S2).\n\nWe also evaluated possible biological and technical sources of variation in the filtered data, confirming that most of the variation in the gene expression data is explained by tissue type ( C and S1D). Finally, we obtained genotype data for each animal from either high-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data16 or high-fidelity imputation24 from low-coverage WGS data (Figure S3). These data allowed us to investigate how gene expression and genetic regulation change in response to the HCHF diet in a controlled environment.\n\nHCHF diet induces tissue-specific transcriptional responses involved in inflammation and fibrosis progression\n\nAs a first step of our analysis, we characterized gene expression changes in response to the HCHF diet in each tissue. Across the three tissue types, we classified 6,378 genes as diet-responsive (DR); namely, genes that are differentially expressed between LCLF and HCHF conditions in at least one tissue type (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01, Figure S4A; Table S3). By jointly analyzing the DR effects, we found that more than 60% of DR genes are specific to a single tissue (Figures S4B and S4C). To understand how DR genes function at a broad level, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in each tissue using 50 hallmark gene sets that represent well-defined biological states or processes.25 Among the top-scoring results, we identified positive enrichment of DR genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammatory responses, interferon responses, KRAS signaling, tumor necrosis factor α signaling, and other immune-related processes in adipose and liver ( A, S5, and S6). Both chronic inflammatory microenvironment and EMT have been shown to promote pathological fibrosis and metabolic dysfunction in tissues such as adipose and liver.26,27\n\nIn rodents, excess dietary fat and cholesterol have been shown to promote an increase in tissue-resident inflammatory immune cells.28,29 To determine whether the HCHF diet induced a similar shift in the cell composition of baboon tissues, we compared the inferred cell type composition in each tissue before and after the change in diet (Figure S7). We found a variety of immune cell types, including dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, to be significantly more enriched following the HCHF diet, specifically in adipose and liver ( B; Table S4). Expansion of monocyte-differentiated macrophages has been shown to promote fibrosis in human liver.27,30 Indeed, we observed an enrichment of fibroblasts in liver after the switch to the HCHF diet (Figure S7).\n\nAdipose shows sex-biased gene expression changes in response to HCHF diet\n\nMany metabolic traits show sex-differential characteristics, which could be explained by sex biases in biological processes and genetic regulation. We thus explored whether male and female baboons differed in their transcriptional responses to the HCHF diet. While we found no evidence of sex bias among DR genes in liver or muscle, we classified 1,434 sex-biased DR genes (FDR < 0.05) in adipose tissue ( C, S8A, and S8B; Table S5). GSEA revealed that male-biased DR genes are more enriched in immune-related functions, whereas female-biased DR genes are more enriched in metabolic processes ( D). To explore these patterns further, we performed an independent analysis of expression data from males and females separately. Our sex-stratified analysis indicates that immune responses are enhanced in both sexes, with a stronger enrichment in males after the HCHF diet (Figure S8C). We also observed that metabolic processes in adipose are pervasively enhanced in females but not in males, particularly in adipogenesis. While the mechanism is not fully elucidated, previous evidence suggests that hormonal differences between sexes could contribute to differences in a variety of biological processes in adipose in response to dietary fat. For example, estrogens, the primary female sex hormones, have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, enhance insulin sensitivity, and promote adipose hyperplasia.31,32,33,34\n\nRegulatory effects of eQTLs are responsive to diet\n\nAlthough we observed global transcriptional responses to HCHF diet in baboons, the dietary effects on gene expression can vary across genetic backgrounds. Captive non-human primates, even with a relatively small sample size, have exhibited their power in eQTL studies due to the homogeneous environment and uniform tissue collection process.35 Leveraging the unique advantages of the baboon model, we investigated gene-by-diet interactions and characterized DR genetic effects on gene expression. First, we mapped cis genetic variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] > 5%) that are associated with gene expression levels (eQTLs) of their cognate genes in each tissue independently, separated by diet condition. To do this, we fit a linear model accounting for relatedness, known sample covariates, and cryptic sources of gene expression variability. Across all six combinations of tissue and diet, we discovered 7,471 genes with at least one significant cis-eQTL (FDR < 0.05; Table S6), ranging from 2,112 to 3,509 per tissue and diet combination (Figure S9A). To increase power, we also performed a joint analysis of the effects of all top variant-gene pairs (n = 14,814) across all tissue and diet combinations using mashr.36 With this more powerful approach, which leverages the information across all samples in our study, we found a total of 12,402 eQTLs (local false sign rate [LFSR] < 0.05; Figure S9B).\n\nWe further explored this set of eQTL-gene pairs to identify DR eQTLs in each tissue. DR eQTLs may differ in the presence, magnitude, or direction of their effects between the different diet conditions. We identified 2,714 DR eQTL-gene pairs with diet-specific effects in at least one tissue (LFSR < 0.05, magnitude > 1.5; A; Table S7). Depending on the tissue, between 49% and 58% DR eQTLs have stronger effects in the HCHF diet. We observed that the DR eQTLs are highly tissue specific. Only 6% of DR eQTLs are shared in at least two tissues, while pairwise sharing of steady-state eQTLs across tissues is 29%–38% (Figure S10). For example, a DR eQTL (chr1:131619858:G_T; p = 3.5 × 10−5) for APOA2 emerged in response to the HCHF diet and is present only in liver ( B). APOA2 is involved in lipid metabolism and transport,37 and multiple variants that are linked to APOA2 have been found to be associated with cholesterol levels in humans.38 An interaction between an APOA2 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and saturated fat intake has also been reported to influence body mass index (BMI) and obesity.39,40,41 This non-coding SNP of APOA2 (rs5082) shows a significant positive association with BMI in three independent cohorts of European and Hispanic individuals with high saturated fat intake (>22 g/day) ( C). Non-coding trait-associated loci in humans are predominantly located in open chromatin regions in relevant cell types and are enriched in gene regulatory elements, suggesting that they are mediated by altering gene regulation of nearby genes. However, no eQTLs have been found to be linked to APOA2 in adipose, liver, or muscle from standard eQTL mapping studies such as GTEx, indicating that some eQTLs may be revealed only in specific contexts, as suggested by other studies.\n\nDR eQTLs colocalize with lipid biomarkers\n\nNext, we sought to assess whether DR eQTLs can explain the molecular basis of relevant physiological traits. We performed physiological QTL mapping for 10 lipid biomarkers collected from the same cohort of baboons before and after the HCHF diet intervention42 (Figure S11; Table S8). Using a multi-trait colocalization method,43 we identified seven regions where an eQTL colocalized with at least one lipid biomarker (posterior probability of sharing the same causal variant [PP] > 0.5; Figure S12). All seven colocalizations are linked to genes that contain variants associated with metabolic-relevant traits in human GWASs. Within these seven regions, we found two DR eQTL-lipid biomarker colocalizations. For example, a DR eQTL (chr2:74238226:C_T) for MAGI1 colocalized with a variant associated with the size distribution of high-density lipoprotein in baboons (PP = 0.54, PPcandidate_SNP = 0.91; Figure S13A). MAGI1 is genetically associated with a variety of relevant human traits, including cholesteryl ester (17:0) levels44 and coronary artery calcification.45 The two DR eQTL-lipid biomarker colocalizations we identified have similar effects on the corresponding lipid biomarkers in both diet conditions (Figure S13), suggesting that the mediated effects of eQTLs on phenotypes can be context dependent. Despite the limited sample size, our results suggest that DR eQTLs, and more generally, dynamic eQTLs identified in disease-relevant contexts, are useful for characterizing GWAS loci in humans.\n\nSex interacts with DR gene regulation\n\nGiven that we observed sex-biased transcriptional responses to the HCHF diet in adipose tissue, we sought to investigate sex effects on DR gene regulation. We mapped sex-biased eQTLs by incorporating a genotype-by-sex (GxSex) interaction term into our models for each tissue and diet combination. Across all tissues, we found eight sexually dimorphic DR eQTLs (FDR < 0.25) (Figure S14; Table S9), which are either present exclusively in one sex, present in both sexes with a concordant allelic effect but different effect sizes, or present in both sexes with a discordant allelic effect. More than half of sex-biased eQTLs are observed only in response to diet, indicating that sex effects can mask DR genetic effects (Figures S14A–S14E).\n\nFor example, we found that a DR eQTL for OLR1 (chr9:8884799:C_T) in muscle has opposite effects in males and females and was not discovered in our sex-combined analyses (pGxSex = 1.5 × 10−7; D). OLR1 encodes lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and has been shown to be associated with its protein level in GWASs.46 It also harbors a missense variant (rs11053646; K167N) in humans that has been reported to have a sex-specific association with carotid atherosclerotic plaque in individuals of Dominican descent.47 Sex-stratified analysis revealed that rs11053646 is significantly associated with plaque presence and all plaque subphenotypes in women (odds ratio [OR] = 2.44 to 5.86; p = 3 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−3) but not in men (OR = 0.85 to 1.22; p = 0.77 to 0.92; E).\n\nDR eQTLs exhibit distinct regulatory landscape from steady-state eQTLs\n\nIt is recognized that eQTLs tend to exhibit a strong enrichment near transcription start sites (TSSs).48,49,50 The eQTLs identified in this study follow the same enrichment pattern when considered together ( A). However, when we examine non-DR eQTLs (i.e., eQTLs with similar effects between the diets in a given tissue) and DR eQTLs separately, a distinct localization pattern emerges, with DR eQTLs showing only a modest enrichment near TSS ( A). The genomic location of an eQTL generally reflects the underlying regulatory landscape and functional activity of the target gene.51,52,53 To investigate the genetic architecture of DR gene expression and determine how it differs from that of standard non-responsive gene expression, we analyzed the target genes that are associated with DR eQTLs (DR eGenes), steady-state non-DR eQTLs (non-DR eGenes), and any eQTLs (all eGenes) in each tissue. We assessed regulatory complexity and evidence of selective constraint for each group of eGenes.\n\nA gene can initiate transcription from multiple TSSs.50 The regulation of TSS selection plays a crucial role in gene expression diversity and complexity, enabling context-specific transcriptional programs.54 To explore the potential association between diet responsiveness and TSS usage, we computed the number of TSSs that are used for a given gene across a diverse set of cell types using publicly available summary statistics from the FANTOM project.52 Across all genes, the average number of TSSs is 5.3. However, DR eGenes have a higher average TSS count of 5.7 compared to an average of 4.8 TSSs in non-DR eGenes (p = 1.1 × 10−3; B).\n\nEnhancers facilitate precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression by integrating signals from various cellular and environmental cues.55,56,57 To assess eGene enhancer activity, we calculated the accumulative enhancer length for a given eGene across 131 tissue or cell types using enhancer-gene predictions from an activity-by-contact model.58 Our analysis revealed that DR eGenes have a longer accumulative enhancer length per active tissue/cell type compared to the average gene ( C). In contrast, non-DR eGenes had a significantly shorter accumulative enhancer length than DR eGenes (p = 9.4 × 10−3; C), suggesting that the DR gene regulation may be in part modulated through enhancer activity.\n\nPrevious evidence suggests that natural selection plays a significant role in shaping the genetic architecture of complex traits.59,60 It has been observed that selectively constrained genes are depleted in eQTL genes.61 Consistent with previous findings, we found that genes depleted of loss-of-function (LoF) variants, as measured by the pLI (probability of loss-of-function intolerance) score, are underrepresented in all eGenes and non-DR eGenes ( D). However, DR eGenes display an enrichment in LoF-intolerant genes, showing a significantly higher proportion of high-pLI genes compared to non-DR eGenes (p = 1.0 × 10−2; D). We also observed that DR eGenes have overall higher MAFs than non-DR eGenes, despite the fact that stronger selective pressure is often associated with lower MAFs (Figure S15). This might be explained by higher MAFs giving more power to detect eQTLs with variable effects across multiple contexts that frequently have smaller effect sizes than standard eQTLs shared across conditions.62\n\nDR eGenes are involved in diverse biological functions\n\nThe distinct regulatory architectures and natural selection signatures we observed for DR and non-DR eGenes could reflect functional differences. To investigate the functional features of DR eGenes, we performed gene enrichment for a list of broadly defined Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms. Many functional categories show clear depletion of eQTLs, with the depletion being more pronounced in non-DR eGenes (Figure S16A). The depletion is more prominent for categories with a higher average pLI such as processes related to transcriptional regulation (“positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II” and “negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated”). This pattern suggests that selection purges eQTLs for genes with evolutionarily important functions. In contrast, a variety of GO categories are enriched among DR eGenes. This pervasive enrichment has also been observed for GWAS genes,6 suggesting a functional similarity between DR eGenes and genes that are associated with complex traits.\n\nMany biological functions are modulated by transcription factors (TFs), which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, cell fate, development, and responses to environmental stimuli.63 TFs have consistently been observed to be underrepresented among eGenes. To examine whether DR eGenes differ in TF representation, we calculated the proportion of TFs in each category of eGenes. We found a significant depletion of TFs in non-DR eGenes but a slight enrichment in DR eGenes (Figure S16B). This observation suggests that TFs may play a more prominent role in mediating DR gene expression, potentially contributing to their functional significance in the context of dietary influences.\n\nDR eGenes are enriched among relevant disease-associated genes in humans\n\nWe have identified several features that distinguish DR eQTLs from standard eQTLs, including a suggestive functional resemblance between DR eGenes and GWAS genes. To explore whether DR genetic effects in baboons can provide functional insight into human non-coding GWAS variants, we integrated our results with results from human GWASs. Although SNPs are typically not conserved across species,64 the human orthologs of eQTL genes identified in other primates tend to be associated with eQTLs in humans.35,65 Consistently, we observed significant enrichment of baboon eGenes with a known human ortholog among human eGenes from GTEx, particularly in matched tissue types (Figure S17). Therefore, we focused on comparing baboon DR eGenes identified in our study and human GWAS genes from public datasets.\n\nWe tested for enrichment of baboon DR eGenes in human GWAS genes for 22 HCHF-related traits using publicly available summary statistics from UK Biobank.66 We found that the human orthologs of DR eGenes identified in baboons are enriched among GWAS genes for most of the HCHF-related traits ( A). Notable enrichments include BMI, cholesterol traits, obesity, peripheral atherosclerosis, and liver cirrhosis, which are relevant to dietary fat or cholesterol intake and are manifested in the tissue types collected in this study. However, non-DR eGenes show consistent depletion in all HCHF-related traits except for coronary atherosclerosis ( A).\n\nTo assess the specificity of the representation of DR eGenes in GWASs, we expanded our analysis to more traits and diseases using publicly available summary statistics from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog,67 which encompasses all published GWASs. We assessed the relevance of diet to a broad range of traits, including 98 metabolic traits and 213 non-metabolic traits. We performed enrichment tests for DR eGenes in GWAS genes for each trait. Our results revealed that DR eGenes are systematically enriched in genes associated with metabolic-relevant traits (pcombined = 3.8 × 10−5; Table S10), with prominent signals in traits relevant to an HCHF diet, such as carotid intima-media thickness, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, BMI, and triglyceride levels ( B). When we performed the same analysis for non-DR eGenes with similar expression levels or genes that are differentially expressed in response to the diet, we observed no enrichment, suggesting that this enrichment was not confounded by differences in gene expression levels or differential transcriptional response to diet (Figures S18A and S18B). In contrast, we observed no enrichment of DR eGenes in non-metabolic traits (pcombined = 0.12; B; Table S11). In fact, we observed a depletion of non-DR eGenes in both groups of traits (Figure S18C), which is consistent with our previous observation that steady-state eGenes are pervasively depleted in GWASs for the 22 HCHF-related traits. Together, our results suggest that DR effects identified in baboons are translationally relevant to human health and can be leveraged to characterize the function of disease-associated genes.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn our 2-year dietary intervention study, we observed considerable effects of a sustained HCHF diet on global gene expression levels in baboons. We found evidence for both tissue- and sex-specific transcriptional changes, reflecting the dynamic impacts of diet in different contexts. Other factors that are not characterized in this study, such as social behavior,68 have also been previously shown to modulate diet effects on gene expression, pointing to the multi-faceted nature of interactions between diet and gene expression. We also identified genetic loci that are associated with inter-individual transcriptional differences in response to diet. We characterized hundreds of eQTLs in response to diet and found that DR eGenes in baboons can be valuable to interpret genetic associations with disease in humans. Our results further emphasize the intricate complexity of genetic regulatory effects and the value of considering GxE interactions in genetic studies of complex disease.\n\nOur study underscores the strength of the baboon model in studying GxE interactions that present formidable challenges in human studies. The physiological similarity between baboons and humans, combined with the controlled environmental conditions of our study, enables us to suggest additional candidate genes associated with diseases that previously evaded identification in human studies of gene regulation.\n\nFor example, APOA2 has a diet-specific genetic association with BMI and obesity in human populations.39,40,41 Yet, despite having much larger sample sizes, no standard eQTLs for APOA2 have been discovered in adipose, liver, or muscle tissues from GTEx.7 Here, we identified an eQTL for the baboon APOA2 ortholog in liver, which emerged solely in response to the HCHF diet. This example demonstrates the potential of contextually functional regulatory variants, even those found in non-human primates, in extending our understanding of disease loci. With the specific enrichment of DR eGenes among GWAS signals for human metabolic traits, the translational relevance of the baboon model to human health becomes undeniably clear.\n\nBy considering the genetic architecture of DR gene expression, we discovered that DR eQTLs exhibit a localization pattern that is distinct from non-DR eQTLs, featuring a more evenly distributed distance to the TSS. Disease-associated loci found in human GWAS also typically reside at greater distances from the nearest TSS compared to standard eQTLs.1 Additionally, disease-associated loci in humans appear to evolve under stronger stabilizing selection59,60 and are associated with more complex regulatory landscapes than genes not associated with disease.6,69 Similarly, compared to standard eQTLs, DR eQTLs are enriched among genes with complex regulatory landscapes, enduring stronger selective constraints and participating in diverse biological functions. Together, our observations support the notion that context-specific eQTLs with more complex regulatory effects hold the key to a more profound understanding of GWAS signals.\n\nIt was previously shown that standard eQTLs generally evolve neutrally or under weak selection70 and that they are broadly shared across tissues.36 Furthermore, genes that are highly conserved across species,65 TFs, and genes in the center of regulatory networks53 are all notably depleted for standard eQTLs. It is therefore not surprising that our findings reveal systematic differences between context-responsive eQTLs and standard eQTLs. Not only do context-responsive eQTLs have more complex regulatory effects, but they are more likely to be functionally important and subject to natural selection, making them more likely to underlie inter-individual differences in disease risk.\n\nWe anticipate that expanding resources in non-human primates, even with relatively small available sample sizes, will enable further characterization of complex, multi-tissue disease-relevant GxE effects and enhance the interpretation of GWAS signals for a wide range of complex traits in humans. This, in turn, will provide additional support for the notion that eQTLs with disease-relevant GxE interactions are crucial for a better understanding of non-coding GWAS variants.\n\nLimitations of the study\n\nThe baboons in this study were maintained in social group housing, consistent with best practices for this species. All baboons were fed daily and were allowed to eat ad libitum. With that in mind, we have not collected data on specific feeding habits of individuals within the group due to technical constraints. It therefore remains possible that some inter-individual variation in feeding could explain a subset of our results. Similarly, it is possible that diet effects on gene expression might be mediated by other factors that are not characterized in this study, such as social interactions. Although, anecdotally, no noticeable changes in behavioral patterns were observed in our cohort of the baboons under HCHF diet, comprehensive measurement of social behaviors and other relevant data will help further dissect diet effects and provide more biological insights. Finally, like most studies of non-human primates, we only have a limited number of baboons. While we were able to measure the lipid biomarkers in a controlled environment under uniform conditions, our sample size is small for the whole-genome mapping. Therefore, both lipid biomarker QTL discovery and colocalization are underpowered.\n\nSTAR★Methods\n\nKey resources table\n\nResource availablity\n\nLead contact\n\nFurther information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Yoav Gilad (ude.ogacihcu@dalig).\n\nMaterials availability\n\nThis study did not generate new unique reagents.\n\nData and code availability\n\nThe WGS data are available at BioProject.

The 99 baboons included 42 females and 57 males with ages ranging from 6 years to 14.7 years. The mean age for the females was 10.4 years (range = 6.4 to 14.7 years) and that of the males was 9.2 years (range = 6 to 12.5 years). The female animals in this study were not pregnant or lactating during the two-year diet intervention. They did not receive any form of birth control and were living with infertile males in their normal social groups. The male baboons in this study were housed in social groups separate from the females and were not castrated. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Texas Biomedical Research Institute’s (TBRI) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) facilities at TBRI and the animal use programs are accredited by Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC), operate according to all National Institutes of Health (NIH) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines, and directed by veterinarians (DVM). The SNPRC veterinarians made all animal care decisions. All animals were housed in group cages allowing them to live in their normal social groups with ad libitum access to food and water. Enrichment was provided on a daily basis by the SNPRC veterinary staff and behavioral staff in accordance with AAALAC, NIH, and USDA guidelines.\n\nMethod details\n\nDiet intervention\n\nThe baboons were maintained on a chow diet, low in cholesterol and fat (LCLF) from birth until they began a two-year dietary challenge with a diet high in cholesterol and saturated fat (HCHF). Table S1 shows the composition of the chow LCLF diet (Monkey Diet 15%/5LEO, LabDiet), the chow diet was used to prepare to atherogenic HCHF diet (Monkey Diet 25/50456, LabDiet), and the complete HCHF diet. To make the HCHF diet, we add a mix of lard, cholesterol, sodium chloride, vitamins [ascorbic acid and vitamin A (a retinyl acetate)], and water to the chow diet. Metabolizable energy is approximately 3.8 kcal/g, with 40% of calories from fat, 40% of calories from carbohydrates, and 20% of calories from protein. We measured the composition of total fatty acids by gas-liquid chromatography of the fatty acid methyl esters [on DB-225 column (15 m), J&W Scientific]. Saturated fatty acids include myristic (1.7%), palmitic (24.9%), and stearic (17.9%); monounsaturated fatty acids include palmitoleic (2%) and oleic (38.7%); and polyunsaturated acids include linoleic (13.9%) and linolenic (0.9%). All baboons in the study were fed daily and allowed to eat ad libitum. We were not able to monitor and measure the amount of food consumed by each individual animal as they were maintained in social group housing, consistent with best practices for this species. The approximate mean daily intake per animal of the LCLF diet was 500 g (∼1500 kcal) and that for the HCHF diet was 400 g (∼1200 kcal). The mean amount of cholesterol consumed daily by animals on each of these diets was approximately 30 mg and 2230 mg, respectively.\n\nTissue sample collection\n\nBaboon tissue samples were collected just prior to beginning the two-year HCHF diet challenge (while on the LCLF diet) and again at the end of the two-year HCHF diet challenge. The baboons were sedated with ketamine (10 mg/kg), given atropine (0.025 mg/kg), and intubated. Body weight was measured on a calibrated electronic balance and body length was measured between head and feet, with the animals lying on their back. Omental adipose biopsy samples were collected through the abdominal wall; liver biopsy samples were collected from the left lobe of the liver; and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were collected from the quadriceps. During post-biopsy recovery, analgesia was provided in the form of Stadol, 0.15 mg/kg, twice a day, for 3 days and ampicillin, 25 mg/day for 10 days.\n\nLipid biomarker measurement\n\nWe obtained data on circulating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including lipids and lipoproteins, lipoprotein-related enzymes, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress from blood samples collected before and after the two-year HCHF diet intervention. We quantified the concentrations of the following serum lipids and lipoproteins. Total serum cholesterol (TSC) and triglyceride (TRIG) concentrations were determined enzymatically using commercial reagents in a clinical chemistry analyzer. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) was measured in the supernatant after heparin Mn+2 precipitation, and non-HDLC (LDLC) was calculated as the difference between total and HDLC. Concentrations of apolipoproteins AI (APOAI), B (APOB), and E (APOE) were determined using an immunoturbidometric approach with commercial reagents in a clinical chemistry analyzer. We measured plasma oxidized LDL (oxLDL) concentrations (U/L) immunologically using a sandwich-style enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (Mercodia Oxidized LDL ELISA; ALPCO Diagnostics). Lipoprotein size distributions were estimated as absorbance in large size particles minus absorbance in small size particles. ΔHDL (dHDL) was calculated as [(fractional absorbance, 8.6 to 10.5 nm)(fractional absorbance, 12 to 19 nm)]x1000; and ΔLDL (dLDL) was calculated as [(fractional absorbance, 27.2 to 28.4 nm)(fractional absorbance, 24.4 to 26 nm)]x1000.82 Most samples were run at least twice, and the mean was used as the final measurement value.\n\nRNA sample processing and sequencing\n\nApproximately 10 mg of each frozen tissue sample was homogenized in 1mL QIAzol Lysis Reagent (79306, QIAGEN) using BeadBug 6 Microtube Homogenizer (D1036, Benchmark Scientific) with 1.5mm Zirconium beads (D1032-15, Benchmark Scientific). RNA was immediately extracted from the homogenate using QIAGEN RNeasy Universal Kit (73404, QIAGEN). RNA concentration and quality was measured using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit and RNA 6000 Pico Kit (5067-1511 & 5067-1513, Agilent) on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Figure S1A). 96 libraries from 16 animals in batch 1 were performed using TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 (RS-122-2001, RS-122-2002, Illumina) and were sequenced 50 base pairs, single-end using the Illumina HiSeq4000 according to manufacturer instructions with the goal of achieving at least 15 million reads per sample (Figure S1B). Each sequencing lane contained 24 multiplexed samples from different RNA extraction batches. 498 libraries from 83 animals in batch 2 were performed using TruSeq stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit (20020595, Illumina) and were sequenced 50 base pairs, paired-end using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 according to manufacturer instructions with the goal of achieving at least 30 million reads per sample (Figure S1B). Each sequencing lane contained 84 multiplexed samples from different RNA extraction batches. Samples from the same animal were always included in the same RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing batches. Samples from different animals were randomized in every processing step to avoid potential batch effects.\n\nRNA-seq data\n\nRNA-seq data were aligned to the baboon reference genome Panubis1.0 with STAR v2.7.7a72. FASTQC was used to confirm that the reads were of high quality. Gene-level expression quantification was performed using featureCounts.72 Quality controls were performed on two levels using a similar pipeline for GTEx.7 On the sample level, we first identified and removed five sample swaps and contaminations where a sample was not matched to its genotype or contained a mixture of two or more samples using verifyBamID.73 We removed 18 outlier samples based on expression profile using PCA. We checked sex correctness by examining gene expression for genes on the Y chromosome for each sample (Figure S2). On the gene level, gene expression values for all samples from a given tissue were normalized using the following procedure: 1) read counts were normalized between samples using trimmed mean of M-values (TMM); 2) genes were selected based on expression thresholds of ≥0.1 TPM in ≥10% of samples, and >3 reads (unnormalized) in ≥10% of samples for both diet conditions; 3) expression values for each gene were inverse normal transformed across samples. After the quality controls, we obtained 570 high-quality RNA samples and 20,224 genes for downstream analyses.\n\nGenotype and imputation\n\nWGS data was collected and provided by the Wall lab, with most of the animals having a low coverage genome ( A).16 We generated a reference panel using SHAPEIT4 from 202 high-coverage (>10X) baboons from the same colony. SHAPEIT4 is a fast and accurate method for estimation of haplotypes (i.e., phasing) for SNP array and high coverage sequencing data.75 To increase the accuracy of phasing, we incorporated pedigree information by including sets of pre-phased genotypes (i.e., haplotype scaffold) derived from pedigree data using akt.74 We next imputed the animals with low-coverage WGS data (<10X) using GLIMPSE. GLIMPSE is a powerful tool to impute genotypes from low-coverage sequencing data.24 We validated the accuracy of imputation by imputing a pseudo-low-coverage genome. Using 30X WGS data from a baboon that was not included in the reference panel, we downsampled the reads to 4X coverage. We imputed this downsampled data and computed the squared Pearson correlation between imputed dosages (in MAF bins) and highly-confident genotype calls from the original high-coverage data (Figure S3B). For SNPs with MAF>5%, the correlation is larger than 0.9. Due to the lack of genetic maps for X and Y chromosomes, we were not able to phase or impute genotypes for the sex chromosomes, thereby including only autosomes. After excluding low allele-frequency (MAF <5%) and monomorphic SNPs, we obtained 16,671,556 autosomal SNPs across 99 animals for downstream analyses.\n\nCell type enrichment\n\nCell type enrichment scores for each sample were computed by running xCell on the full TPM gene expression matrix of the 570 post-QC samples. The xCell method uses single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to score each sample and estimate the enrichment of 64 reference cell types, spanning multiple adaptive and innate immunity cells, hematopoietic progenitors, epithelial cells, and extracellular matrix cells. The reference cell types are defined by gene signatures learned from thousands of pure cell types from various sources.23 The raw enrichment score per cell type is defined as the average ssGSEA score from all the cell types’ corresponding signatures. Then, the raw scores are transformed to a linear scale that resembles percentages. The cell type enrichment scores shown in the results are transformed scores. For sanity check, we examined the enrichment of representative cell types for each tissue including adipocytes, hepatocytes, and myocytes ( B). For each tissue, we fit a linear regression to test for differences in the cell type enrichment between diets while adjusting for sex, age, RIN, and batch effects.\n\nEnrichmentscore∼diet+sex+age+RIN+batch+ε\n\np-values were obtained from t-test assessing the significance of the coefficient for diet in the linear regression model above. We corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and determined significance as FDR ≤0.05. We visualized sample clustering using heatmaps for the 15 highly enriched cell types with both mean and median enrichment scores >0.05 in at least one tissue (Figure S7A). We calculated correlations between the enrichment and age, sex, and diet in each tissue using Spearman’s correlation test (Figure S7B).\n\nDifferential expression\n\nWe performed differential expression (DE) analysis using dream. Dream uses a linear mixed model to increase power and decrease false positives for RNA-seq datasets with repeated measurements.76 In each tissue type, we set diet, sex, age, and RIN as fixed effects and individual and batch as random effects in a linear mixed model. We first used sva83 to identify surrogate variables for unknown sources of variation. Using the function num.sv, we identified zero latent factors that need to be estimated and accounted for. Using dream, we estimated precision weights, fit the model on each gene using the Satterthwaite approximation for the hypothesis test by default, and applied empirical Bayes shrinkage on the linear mixed model.\n\nexp∼diet+sex+age+RIN+batch+ID+ε\n\nThe response variable `exp` is a vector of TMM-normalized expression level of all samples for a given gene. ε is normally distributed error modeled with precision weights via an iterative optimization algorithm. Hypothesis testing is performed by specifying a contrast matrix that is a linear combination of the estimated coefficients and evaluating the null model. Genes with an FDR-adjusted p value <0.01 were considered DE genes. We applied mashr to estimate sharing of DE across tissues. mashr is a powerful statistical method to estimate and test for effects across conditions while accounting for the sharing information.36 For all tested genes, we provided the effect size and corresponding standard error matrices estimated from dream to mashr to jointly model differential expression. To avoid potential bias of including tissue-specific genes in the joint analysis for discovering tissue-specific effects, we included commonly shared genes across all conditions. No effect size is post hoc set to 0 for mashr. We estimated paired-wise sharing by LFSR <0.01 in at least one condition and the magnitude of effect sizes >1.5 between conditions from mashr (Figure S4B).\n\nSex-biased differential expression\n\nWe performed sex-biased differential expression analysis using the same procedures. We defined sex-biased diet-responsive (DR) effect on gene expression as difference in diet effect on gene expression between males and females. Specifically, when the expression level of a gene is altered in response to diet, and when this altered response differs between males and females, we call this a sex-biased diet-responsive effect on gene expression. We fit a linear mixed model using dream while accounting for age, RIN, batch and individual effects.\n\nexp∼diet_sex+age+RIN+batch+ID+ε\n\nIn each tissue type, we set diet_sex (combination of diet and sex), age, RIN, and batch as fixed effects and individual as a random effect in a linear mixed model. dream allows us to perform a hypothesis test of a linear combination of coefficients by using a contrast matrix from the `makeContrastsDream` function in R package variancePartition. Here, we tested the difference of diet effect between males and females (i.e., sex-biased diet effects), asking which genes respond differently to the HCHF diet in males compared to females. The difference of differences is the interaction term in the model. Due to the smaller effective sample size in sex-biased DE analysis, we used FDR <0.05 to identify sex-biased DE genes.\n\nWe replicated the results by using another approach where we searched for sex-specific DE genes in each tissue (Figure S8). We performed DE analysis for males and females separately in each tissue using the same model as described in the “differential expression” section above. We performed joint analysis by feeding the statistics from the sex-stratified DE analysis to mashr where we treated each sex and tissue combination as conditions. We identified sex-specific DE genes in each tissue by local false sign rate (LFSR) < 0.05 in at least one condition and the magnitude of effect sizes >2.5 between diets.\n\nGene set enrichment analysis\n\nWe performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the R package fgsea. fgsea is a powerful method that quickly estimates arbitrarily low GSEA p values accurately based on an adaptive multi-level split Monte-Carlo scheme.77 We excluded unannotated genes with a symbol beginning with “LOC” whose human orthologs have not been determined in the baboon reference genome (Panubis1.0). We used pre-ranked t-statistics for all tested annotated genes in each tissue from DE analysis as input and 50 hallmark gene sets from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB v7.5.1) as reference gene sets.25 The hallmark gene sets summarize and represent specific well-defined biological states or processes and display coherent expression. These gene sets were generated by a computational methodology based on identifying overlaps between gene sets in other MSigDB collections and retaining genes whose gene expression levels are coordinate. Multiple testing was corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and an FDR ≤0.05 and absolute NES >1 was considered as significant enrichment. NES is a normalized enrichment score used to account for the size of a gene set and correlation between a gene set and genes in the ranked list.\n\neQTL mapping\n\ncis-eQTL mapping was performed using a relatedness-accounted modified linear regression model implemented by MatrixEQTL.78 In a regular linear regression model, the error term ε is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) across samples (i.e., uncorrelated homoscedastic errors).\n\ny=α+βg+ε;ε∼i.i.dN(0,σ2)\n\nTo account for the relatedness of the samples, we used correlated errors by feeding a relatedness matrix (K) as the error variance-covariance matrix to the parameter errorCovariance in MatrixEQTL.\n\ny=α+βg+μ\n\nμ∼N(0,Kσ2)\n\nTo maintain the assumption of a linear regression model, MatrixEQTL makes an internal transformation on the input variables, which makes the errors independent and identically distributed.\n\ny˜=K−1/2y,g˜=K−1/2g,q˜=K−1/21n\n\ny˜=αq˜+βg˜+δ;δ∼i.i.dN(0,σ2)\n\nThe genetic relatedness matrix was estimated from all 99 animals’ genotypes using GEMMA79 and it reflects the genetic relatedness relationship between each pair of individuals. We validated the relatedness estimation by comparing with pedigree information. The matrix was subset by the animals included in each condition and if necessary, the matrix was transformed to positive definite using the make.positive.definite function from the R package corpcor for the eQTL mapping.\n\nWe filtered SNPs in each tissue and diet combination by allele frequency and genotype frequency. We removed outlier SNPs with MAF <0.05. We also filtered out loci with <2 homozygotes across samples in each tissue and diet combination.\n\nWe included the known variables sex, age, RIN, and batch as covariates. To capture hidden technical or biological factors of expression variability, we infer principal components (PCs) from the gene expression matrix for each tissue x diet condition using PCAforQTL.80 The number of PCs was selected and included in the model as covariates based on the elbow method and the Buja and Eyuboglu (BE) algorithm, which also approximately maximized cis-eGene discovery. We computed the correlation of the selected PCs and the known variables and removed those that were highly correlated with any of the selected PCs (R2 > 0.9).\n\nThe mapping window was defined as 100kb up- and downstream of the transcription start site. We output all results by setting the pvOutputThreshold = 1. To identify genes with at least one significant eQTL (cis-eGenes), the top nominal p value for each gene was selected and corrected for multiple testing at the gene level using eigenMT.81 eigenMT is an efficient multiple hypothesis testing correction method that estimates the effective number of tests using a genotype correlation matrix and then applying Bonferroni correction. Genome-wide significance was then determined by computing Benjamini-Hochberg FDR on the top eigenMT-corrected p value for each gene.\n\nDiet-responsive eQTLs\n\nTo combat the issue of incomplete power, we used mashr to estimate sharing between conditions, and to identify diet-specific dynamic effects in each tissue. By jointly analyzing genetic effects across multiple conditions, mashr increases power and improves effect-size estimates, thereby allowing for greater confidence in effect sharing and estimates of condition-specificity. We ran mashr using the output of eQTL mapping from MatrixEQTL of all six conditions. To avoid potential bias of including tissue-specific genes in the joint analysis for discovering tissue-specific effects, we included commonly shared genes across all conditions. No effect size is post hoc set to 0 for mashr. To better learn the heterogeneous patterns of sharing from data and improve the accuracy of estimates, we implemented an optimized algorithm, ultimate deconvolution.84 For each gene, the top SNP with the largest univariate |Z|-statistic across all conditions was selected. The top SNPs with LFSR <0.05 were designated as significant eQTLs. To investigate sharing of the top eQTLs between diets, we assessed sharing of effects by magnitude (effects have similar magnitude within a factor of 1.5) for the top SNPs that are significant eQTLs in at least one diet within each tissue separately. DR eQTLs are SNPs that are significant eQTLs in at least one diet for a given tissue and the fold change of effects between diets is more than a factor of 1.5. A DR eGene is a gene with at least one DR eQTL. Non-DR eQTLs are SNPs that are significant eQTLs in at least one diet for a given tissue and the fold change of effects between diets is less than a factor of 1.5. A non-DR eGene is a gene with at least one eQTL but no DR eQTLs.\n\nPhysiological QTL mapping\n\nWe removed outliers by dropping any sample that had a biomarker level greater than 20-fold the interquartile range or greater than 10-fold below the median across all samples. The measurement values for each biomarker were inverse normal transformed across samples. We mapped physiological quantitative trait loci across whole genome using the same relatedness-accounted modified linear regression model as eQTL mapping described above.\n\nmeasurement=α+Σkβk·covariatek+γ·genotype+μ;μ∼N(0,Kσ2)\n\nColocalization\n\nWe used HyPrColoc to determine whether eQTL and trait associations are explained by the same causal variant explains. HyPrColoc is an efficient deterministic Bayesian divisive clustering algorithm that uses GWAS summary statistics to detect colocalization across vast numbers of traits simultaneously.43 We used the default setting of prior probability = 1x10−4 and a conditional colocalization prior = 0.025. We defined a significant colocalization as having a posterior probability larger than 0.5.\n\nSex-biased eQTLs\n\nWe define sex-biased eQTLs as those cis-eQTLs with a significantly different genetic effect between males and females. We modified the relatedness-accounted linear regression model described in the eQTL mapping section by adding a genotype-by-sex (G x Sex) interaction term and tested for significance of G × Sex interaction. This was implemented in MatrixEQTL by setting useModel = modelLINEAR_CROSS. We filtered SNPs in each tissue and diet combination by removing outlier SNPs with MAF <0.05 and loci with <2 homozygotes across samples in each sex group. We used the same covariates, mapping window, and multiple testing correction approach as described above.\n\nexpression=α+Σkβk·covariatek+γ·genotype+δ·genotype·sex+ε\n\nComparison of genic features\n\nWe compared genic features of DR eGenes, nonDR eGenes, and all eGenes in each tissue. We calculated the TSS count of a given gene by the number of promoter peaks measured by the FANTOM5 project using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE). We estimated enhancer activity of a given gene by computing the accumulative enhancer length across 131 cell or tissue types predicted based on the activity-by-contact (ABC) model (ABC score >0.05). We defined loss-of-function (LoF)-intolerant genes by pLI score >0.9 using the statistic from gnomAD.v2.1.1. For Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we focused on 41 broadly unrelated GO terms that are used in Mostafavi et al. For enrichment in transcription factors (TFs), we used the official list of human TFs (v1.01) from Lambert et al. which includes 1639 human TFs. For all the analyses, we only included the genes that are shared between the testing set for eQTL mapping in this study (n = 14814) and the reference set of the interest. Enrichment tests were performed using Fisher’s exact test.\n\nEnrichment with human GWAS\n\nWe obtained GWAS summary statistics from UK Biobank provided by Ben Neale’s lab66 and The NHGRI-EBI Catalog of human GWAS (v1.0.2, 2022-10-08).67 For GWAS from UK Biobank, we selected 22 HCHF-related traits or disease and linked each GWAS hit to the closest TSS among 19393 protein-coding genes from GENCODE V43. For GWAS from GWAS Catalog, we obtained 507 traits using the “MAPPED_TRAIT” column after filtering for traits with at least 30 associated genes. We classified the traits into metabolic-relevant (n = 98) and non-metabolic relevant traits (n = 213). Ambiguous traits for the classification such as immune- and blood-relevant traits were removed. We obtained genes associated with each trait using the “MAPPED GENE(S)” column where if an SNP is located within a gene, that gene is listed; if an SNP is located within multiple genes, all genes are included; if an SNP is intergenic, the closest gene is included. We tested for enrichment of baboon DR eGenes in human GWAS genes for each trait using Fisher’s exact test. We used Fisher’s method to calculate the combined p values for metabolic-relevant traits and non-metabolic relevant traits, respectively.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank O.
