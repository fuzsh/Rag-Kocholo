I have the ultimate dentist phobia and it is extremely difficult for me to go even for a simple cleaning. The last time I was in the office I didn't have a great experience as I was leaving. That leads me to not going back for a long time. Despite how great Dr M is. Well, fast forward to this past Tuesday. I ahd to go back to have a crown put back on. As always I was panicking and completely scared. But I managed to get in there and the staff were wonderful. But, I had the luck of having Brandy as the lady helping me with the crown refit.

I would recommend Sanford Dental to anyone looking for a dentist....You all are the best...\n\nBetty B.\n\n★★★★★\n\nMy family and I have been going to Sanford Dental Excellence and Dr. Seidler for 4 years. I couldn't be happier with the professional and friendly staff, and personal touch I haven't seen anywhere else. I couldn't recommend this office enough to anyone looking for a new dentist.\n\nJustin C.\n\n★★★★★\n\nI am very happy with Dr. Seidler and the entire practice. The hygienists are thorough, the doctor's work is exacting, and I actually have a good feeling every time I leave the office. Plus, I actually do feel more inclined to smile. How's that for really liking a dental operation!\n\nJane E.\n\n★★★★★\n\nThey are all amazing people and really do care about their patients. I love how they remember your name so quickly and are so friendly. They make you feel comfortable to be yourself and not to mention the smiles are addictive 😁\n\nArya T.\n\n★★★★★\n\nToday was my second visit to Sanford Dental Excellence. All the staff is very nice and the doctors are awesome. I highly recommend checking this place out. You won't be disappointed!!\n\nLorna W.\n\nSchedule Your Complimentary Implant Consultation and 3D Bone Scan Today\n\nCall Now"
