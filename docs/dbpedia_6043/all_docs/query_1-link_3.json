        "text": "The Secretary of the Department\n\nof Arts and Administrative Services,\n\nNoel Tanzer, says he has not resigned\n\nand has \"no intention of doing so\".\n\nHe was reacting to a report of a\n\nshort-list of senior public servants\n\nwhich is understood to have been\n\nunder consideration by the Minister,\n\nBob McMullan. The report said also\n\nthat he had resigned.\n\nMr Tanzer said on Friday that just\n\nas Mark Twain had cabled Associat\n\ned Press that the report of his death\n\nwas an exaggeration, \"the report of\n\nmy resignation ... is equally so\".\n\nHe wanted the record \"put\n\nstraight... lest those on the impres\n\nsive list of candidates for the job of\n\nSecretary of DAS arc getting too cx\n\ncitcd anxiously awaiting a phone call\n\nor some such from my minister\".\n\nIn the interests of public-service\n\nefficiency, he said, he was \"a strong\n\nbeliever\" that senior public servants,\n\nafter a period of about five years or\n\nso in a job, should move into new\n\nareas where they could \"use their\n\nexperience to good effect\" and\n\n\"sharpen their wits at the same\n\ntime\", thus enhancing their over-all\n\ncontribution to public service.\n\n\"On this basis my time to do like\n\nwise is approaching and it is no secret\n\nthat I am prepared to move to anoth\n\ner suitable post if that is what my\n\nemployers want. I believe I still have\n\nplenty to offer and a solid contribu\n\ntion to make\".\n\nMr Tanzer, a distinguished public\n\nservant, has overhauled what was\n\ngenerally thought of as an unwieldy\n\nand difficult department. He has set\n\nup a structure under which much of\n\nit runs on commercial lines and is\n\nfunded on a trust-account basis,\n\nwhile other parts perform their tradi\n\ntional public-intercst functions and\n\nremain on Budget funding.\n\nHe said he was proud of what the\n\ndepartment had achieved in recent\n\nyears.\n\n\"The credit for that goes to the\n\nDAS people who have strenuously\n\ntaken up the challenge of the Public\n\nService reforms and made them\n\nwork in our context. There is no\n\ndoubt in my mind that they will con\n\ntinue to go from strength to\n\nstrength\".\n\nI understand that Mr Tanzer sig\n\nnalled earlier this year his intention\n\nto move on, but was persuaded by\n\nSenator McMullan to stay when he\n\nbecame minister."
