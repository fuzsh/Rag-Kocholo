The Secretary of the Department

of Arts and Administrative Services,

Noel Tanzer, says he has not resigned

and has "no intention of doing so".

He was reacting to a report of a

short-list of senior public servants

which is understood to have been

under consideration by the Minister,

Bob McMullan. The report said also

that he had resigned.

Mr Tanzer said on Friday that just

as Mark Twain had cabled Associat

ed Press that the report of his death

was an exaggeration, "the report of

my resignation ... is equally so".

He wanted the record "put

straight... lest those on the impres

sive list of candidates for the job of

Secretary of DAS arc getting too cx

citcd anxiously awaiting a phone call

or some such from my minister".

In the interests of public-service

efficiency, he said, he was "a strong

believer" that senior public servants,

after a period of about five years or

so in a job, should move into new

areas where they could "use their

experience to good effect" and

"sharpen their wits at the same

time", thus enhancing their over-all

contribution to public service.

"On this basis my time to do like

wise is approaching and it is no secret

that I am prepared to move to anoth

er suitable post if that is what my

employers want. I believe I still have

plenty to offer and a solid contribu

tion to make".

Mr Tanzer, a distinguished public

servant, has overhauled what was

generally thought of as an unwieldy

and difficult department. He has set

up a structure under which much of

it runs on commercial lines and is

funded on a trust-account basis,

while other parts perform their tradi

tional public-intercst functions and

remain on Budget funding.

He said he was proud of what the

department had achieved in recent

years.

"The credit for that goes to the

DAS people who have strenuously

taken up the challenge of the Public

Service reforms and made them

work in our context. There is no

doubt in my mind that they will con

tinue to go from strength to

strength".

I understand that Mr Tanzer sig

nalled earlier this year his intention

to move on, but was persuaded by

Senator McMullan to stay when he

became minister.
