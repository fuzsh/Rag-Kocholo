Analysis[]

Upon losing your final life, you are taken a black screen with each green letters zooming out spelling "GAME OVER", with a red line added under the GAME OVER text, how much score you got and how much of the game you have completed while the Game Over theme plays.

After this, if you have at least one or more continues left, you are taken to a screen with Rolo where he is given an option, the ringmaster with the cage by him representing not wanting to continue or an opened door representing wanting to continue, music is also playing, if you go to the right option, you continue the game, at a cost of a continue, if you pick the left option, the music changes to a dejected piece of music, possibly representing Rolo's accepted fate as the cage closes as you are taken back to the title screen.

Do keep in mind, if you have no continues left when you go on the screen, the music is changed to sound more dejected as the door is now locked and shut, meaning Rolo can't escape, due to having no continues, leaving you with no choice but to go into the cage.

The Game Over screen also appears during the endings, but with no continue screen, since you have beaten the game.
