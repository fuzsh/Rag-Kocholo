        "text": "When a franchise evolves, it’s important that the characters in it evolve as well. While many are successful in recieving a fresh, new look while still managing to resemble themselves enough, there are some cases in which it turns out to be for the worse, and that’s where THESE redesigns come in. So, get ready to want to beat the crap out of the nearest corporate executive, as I list off the Top 5 Worst Video Game Character Redesigns.\n\nNO. 5: Knuckles (Sonic Boom)\n\nI’m not fond of Sonic Boom for a fairly large amount of reasons, and Knuckles’ design in it is one of them. While I can get behind how Big Red Button wanted to put more of an emphasis on his strength, it can’t save the end results from landing a spot on this list. For starters, look at that chest…not only does it look enlarged to downright uncanny levels, but it also contrasts heavily with the lankier legs, resulting in the proportions looking…well, awkward, to say the least. Maybe if they took it easy on the chest and shortened him a bit, I wouldn’t have a problem with it the way I do. But alas, knowing Sega, they have to make a thousand mistakes first, and good decisions second. Sorry Knux, but this is what happens when you skip leg day.\n\nNO. 4: Pac-Man (Pac-Man Party/Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures)\n\nI don’t really know what it is about this design that bothers me so much, but if I had to say at least one specific thing about it, it’s that it just looks off. It’s very obvious that they’re trying to emulate the Sonic franchise’s art style starting from the Adventure games, and if you ask me it’s a pretty miserable attempt. Just because a style suits one franchise, that doesn’t mean that it’ll magically suit any other franchise on the flip of a dime. Look at the animation for the Powerpuff Girls reboot for example; in contrast to the original show’s more dynamic, Hanna-Barbera-esque art style, the reboot goes for one that’s more akin to…well, just about every cartoon since Adventure Time, resulting in a clash of styles that doesn’t really work. Aside from that, he looks kind of creepy as well. I’m not sure if it’s the eyes, but there’s the lingering feeling that something isn’t right. Thank Intellivision that he had his original design in Smash ’14. Regardless, I suggest that you all hold on tight, because this is where it REALLY starts to get bad…\n\nNO. 3: Conker (Young Conker)\n\nOkay, first things first, WHAT IS UP WITH THAT HEAD!? Seriously, it looks like someone stuck an air pump into his mouth! As a side note, those freakishly thin arms and legs, and those eyes… just… let’s move on before I get night terrors.\n\nNO. 2: Spyro (Skylanders)\n\nMy thoughts exactly, Squidward. Just…LOOK AT THAT THING!!! Last time I heard, Spyro was supposed to be a dragon, right? I mean, I’m pretty freaking sure that he’s not supposed to look like a horrifically malformed gargoyle that got painted on and somehow gained a life of its’ own. Even considering the fact that my hatred towards the Skylanders franchise has died down (which is really mostly due to the recent Crash Bandicoot cameo and level pack, and praise the great gaming lords that he didn’t get this treatment in terms of design), I just can’t let go of just how awful this design is! And what makes this even worse is how this wasn’t even meant to be Spyro in the first place. While development of the first Skylanders game was underway, this was originally supposed to be an entirely different character called Fire Dragon, and Spyro himself was going to be an NPC. I don’t know what else to say other than…ugh, just ugh.\n\nNO. 1: Bomberman (Bomberman: Act Zero)\n\nYou know what? Even regarding all of the huge, glaring flaws with the rest of the designs on this list, at least – AT LEAST – they resemble their source characters in one way or another. This? I’m not even sure if the people behind this even played a Bomberman game, let alone heard of one! I couldn’t care less if Konami and Hudson Soft wanted to “update him for an older audience”, there’s absolutely no excuse to take a character as adorable yet badass as Bomberman and turn him into this generic, focus group-reeking, apalling bastard child of Master Chief and Samus! The only good thing that can be said about this…thing is that after his debut game flopped hard, he was locked away in the deepest, darkest corners of the industry, never to be seen again. And for that, we have bettered ourselves as human beings.\n\nAre there any particular video game character redesigns that push your buttons? Be sure to post your thoughts and opinions in the comments section below.\n\nFollowing a brief detour with the likes of Lost World and Boom, the Sonic franchise thankfully appears to be on the path to recovery once again. However, while we’ll have to wait and see if the two games set for release next year can truly deliever on the hype, that doesn’t mean that fans of the hedgehog are bankrupt in terms of content that will satisfy them for the time being. And as it turns out, Sonic Utopia just so happens to be that.\n\nHaving been revealed as the big mystery project of 2016’s SAGE (for those who are unaware, it’s an internet convention for Sonic fan games), Utopia aims to bring the style of the original Genesis/Mega Drive trilogy and CD into an open-world 3D format while also expanding upon the groundbreaking formula that they brought to the platforming genre. In essence, it’s a bit like Sonic Robo Blast 2 in terms of concept, but it still manages to be its’ own unique thing at the same time. There isn’t a release date set for the project, and there probably won’t be for a long, long time, but there’s a demo available if you want to try it for yourselves. If you ask me, this could really be something special – and this is coming from someone who doesn’t even like most of the Sonic games outside of the original games! Not only are the music and art style beautifully nostalgic, but it also succeeds in bringing the charm of the originals into a third-dimensional format. You know, given how the ports of the originals and Mania have actual longtime fans of the franchise attached to them, something tells me it won’t be long until Sega tries to get in contact with these guys as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this valiant effort to bring the hedgehog’s most cherished outings into a fresh new light? Be sure to leave your thoughts and opinions in the comments section below.\n\nIn late 2002, SP released the first installment in what was to become their most iconic franchise, as well as their first Sony-exclusive game, Sly Cooper and the Thevius Raccoonus (or Sly Raccoon in Australia and Europe).\n\nTaking place in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the game’s plot revolves around the titular Sly Cooper, a young raccoon who is the leader of a trio of criminals known as the Cooper Gang, who embarks on a journey that spans across the globe to recover his family’s sacred book. Unfortunately, once again there isn’t a whole lot of information about the development. However, like Rocket I was still able to find some very interesting tidbits. One of the most vital elements of the game is its’ visual aesthetic; to help bring the environments and characters to life in a vivid fashion while also managing to keep the distinct graphical form of a PS2 game, the folks at SP utilized a specific form of cel-shading known as “toon-shading”, a term that was aptly coined by Mr. Flemming. In addition to this, the soundtrack also has a wide range of influences, most notably that of famed animation composers such as Henry Mancini, Carl Stalling, and Yoko Kanno. Sly’s cane was also originally meant to have other forms such as a hose, but this ended up being scrapped. The Japanese version of the game has also been noted for its’ vastly different animated cutscenes, in comparison to the more comic-book-esque cutscenes in the other versions. When the game was released, it was met with a rather positive reception, with most of the praise going to the visuals and the stealth-centric gameplay. Although the game didn’t manage to impress in terms of sales, it eventually managed to gain an audience, granting it a 2003 re-release under the “Greatest Hits” label, as well as three sequels (one of which not developed by SP), a cancelled spin-off, and a film adaptation that is either on hold or also cancelled, as we have barely heard anything about the latter since its’ announcement in 2014.\n\nTo be continued…\n\nBONUS QUESTION: What are your thoughts on the newly-revealed Nintendo Switch? Be sure to leave your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below.\n\nOnce again, I have been granted the pleasant honor of recieving a nomination! This time around, I’d like to thank my good friend DeLuxODonnell92, the creator of Blogspot and WordPress sites respectively titled Kyle’s Animated World and Kyle Loves Animation And More. In addition to knowing a lot about all sorts of media, he’s also just a really great guy to talk to in general. Be sure to check his stuff out and also follow him on Twitter!\n\nFor those who are unaware, the One Lovely Blog Award is a nomination in which the person who is presented with it must state a total of seven tidbits about yourself, then followed by nominating another blog, thus continuing an endless cycle. With that said, let us get to the facts…\n\nNO. 1 – I Vastly Prefer Dry Cereal\n\nI honestly have no clue why, but I always found cereal with milk to be completely disgusting. Maybe it’s because of the sogginess, or how most of the time the taste of the cereal doesn’t go well with milk at all, who knows.\n\nNO. 2 – I Don’t Think The Mega Man Games Are That Great (For The Most Part)\n\nNow before you say anything, let me make it clear that this doesn’t mean I don’t hate them or generally think of them as bad games – far from it, actually. I find them to be fun and unique titles in their own right, but I feel like a lot of them (especially the NES games) can get somewhat repetitive and often abuse the cheap difficulty tatic of game design. However, there are certain exceptions to this. The Mega Man X series is one that I would truly go on to claim as great, and the Zero spin-off games aren’t half-bad either.\n\nNO. 3 – I Really, Really Love Animals\n\nBut even then, I’m not quite sure who doesn’t. In addition to being capaable of amazing biological and physical feats, they can also make unbelievably loyal companions and are also fascinating to research.\n\nNO. 4 – I’m A Huge Soda Addict\n\nOnce I sip a can of one of them, I literally cannot put it down. Seriously, that’s how severe it is. Although I do make efforts to reduce it from my diet once in a while, I still can’t help to have a thirst from it.\n\nNO . 5 – Unless They’re In Proper Hands, I Think That Video Games Should Remain As Video Games\n\nLet’s be honest – video games are a medium that will never truly find any solid ground in terms of adaptations. In addition to frequently BARELY resembling their source games, most of the ones that are more faithful to their source games aren’t that great either. Maybe one day this trope will be subverted, but I ain’t getting my hopes up.\n\nNO. 6 – I’m Not A Sonic Fan\n\nYeah, I have to come clean and admit it. While I absolutely adore the Genesis trilogy and CD and enjoyed some of the other titles in the franchise, I honestly think that most of them range from being mediocre, to bad, to levels of wretchedness that no game should ever be allowed to achieve. It doesn’t help either that when you really think about it, some of them like Heroes and Lost World have legitimately great ideas but end up falling short. If you enjoy the franchise, no harm done. But for the most part, it simply isn’t my cup of tea.\n\n(However, I am greatly looking forward to Mania and Project 2017.)\n\nNO. 7 – I’m Planning On Making A Game Of My Own One Day\n\nIf there’s one thing that I’ve wanted to accomplish since I was a youngling, it’s contributing to my favorite entertainment medium of all time. A couple of years back, I actually created a batch of characters for a potential gaming media franchise (the antagonist of whom I revealed in a tweet not too many days ago). I really want this project to grow into something more in the future, and once I get a hold of an engine (preferably Unity or Unreal Engine), I can get started on it. With that said, I hope you all enjoy what I’m going to be revealing very soon.\n\nTHE NOMINEES:\n\nI Played The Game\n\nhungrygoriya\n\nThe Shameful Narcissist\n\nTHE RULES:\n\nWrite an article accepting the award.\n\nThank the person you nominated you and put a link to their blog.\n\nTell the reader seven facts about yourself.\n\nNominate other blogs for the award.\n\nLet them know that you nominated them.\n\nPost the rules to let your followers know how it works.\n\nYou ever had one of those moments where you feel so utterly perplexed and frustrated by something that you flat-out go “What’s the point”? As of today, I’ve had one of those moments.\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Disney has announced that not only would they be adding one of their most cherished animated gems, The Lion King, to their growing collection of unnecessary remakes/reboots, but that Jon Favareu would also be at the helm of it in response to the positive reception of his take on The Jungle Book (which to be honest, I actually really liked). There is a myriad of reasons as to why the basic idea behind remaking a film as perfect as The Lion King is such a godawful idea, but no matter what we say or do, Disney is still going to go full-steam ahead with this for one measly, contemptible little reason; brand recognition. It’s the same reason as to why remakes and reboots of established properties such as Transformers, The Powerpuff Girls, and A Nightmare on Elm Street lack the heart and soul of their source material so badly, because the only thing that the people in suits see are the piles of dough they could be rolling in. And while I will say that there could be a chance of this being anything else than a disaster due to Favareu’s involvement, it still won’t change the fact that by the end of the day, trying to top what is already perfection ultimately equates to being entirely unnecessary. But then again, it’s not like anyone at Disney could be reading this. I’m just a guy running a semi-popular blog about obscure, old video games, after all.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Simba and the gang potentially getting real? Be sure to leave your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below.\n\nWhen it comes to video game publishers with shady reputations, Electronic Arts (or EA for short) tends to lean rather deep into this category. Although the scorn for them has more or less died down, it still cannot be denied that some of their recent business practices have ranged from being at best questionable to at worst downright shady. Today, however, we’ll be taking a look at one of the titles released far before those days, Rolo to the Rescue.\n\nDeveloped by Vectordean (who were most known for the James Pond series) and published and licensed by Sega for the Genesis in 1992, the game’s story revolves around a young elephant named Rolo who embarks on a journey with his fellow critters to free his mother from a circus. With that out of the way, how does this game fare years after its’ release? Let’s find out, shall we?\n\nTHE LOOKS\n\nAs I’ve stated earlier, Vectordean were the people responsible for the creation of the James Pond games (which interestingly enough is one of the few animal mascot platformers to pre-date the advent of Sonic). And if you really look close enough, you can see that the visual style of those games had somewhat of an influence, especially in the character sprites. The visuals go for an overall “cutesy” aesthetic, which does ultimately end up working in its’ favor. Rolo himself is pretty adorable, the use of colors is pleasing, and there’s even a good amount of variety between the levels. It might not be one of the best-looking Genesis games, but it’s certainly up there.\n\nTHE SOUND\n\nIn a similar vein to the graphics, the music aims for a generally light-hearted tone to appeal to a younger audience, and to be honest, it really works in it’s favor. The level themes, while not spectacular, are quite pleasant to listen to, and even a bit catchy. Granted, it’s not up there with other Genesis titles or even other 16-bit platformers, but for what it is, it’s decent enough.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\n\nFrom an initial standpoint, the gameplay doesn’t exactly offer much. However, what might seem like a generic, run-of-the-mill platformer is actually one that is surprisingly fun. Starting off with the controls, although they might feel a bit wonky at first, it doesn’t take long to master them. Next, the level design as a whole is fairly intriguing. It’s essentially built around the abilities of Rolo and the other playable animals, in which you have to jump and search your way to find secrets as well as the trapped critters whom you must rescue in order to receive the good ending. Speaking of which, the animals themselves help to spice up the gameplay quite nicely, with each of them having their own unique and fun ability which can enable them to get to places Rolo can’t. Overall, while this isn’t anything truly remarkable, it’s most certainly a nice little diversion.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nRolo to the Rescue may not be one of the best Genesis games out there, but for what it is, it’s a rather charming 2D platformer. While I can’t say that everyone will enjoy this game, I can think of two categories of people who most certainly would: children, and people who are simply looking for a game that doesn’t break new ground but is still fun to play nonetheless.\n\nTHE RETR0PIA RANKING\n\nB-\n\nThe PlayStation franchise’s iconic longevity can be attributed to a number of things, but one of them is none other than their significantly diverse line-up of developers. Although a handful of them are not owned by Sony, it can’t be denied that these people have lent a tremendous helping hand in constructing one of the most legendary video game consoles of all time, whether it be Naughty Dog (the subject matter of the first retr0spective), Insomniac Games, and of course, the titular Sucker Punch.\n\nWhile they aren’t quite as prominent or as recognized as some of the other teams under Sony’s belt, it can’t be denied that these folks have gained up quite the desirable reputation over the past few decades. But how exactly did they get to this point? That is what you are about to find out…\n\nIn 1999, two years after their founding in 1997, they released their debut title, as well as the only game by them to be developed for a non-Sony console and the only game by them not to be published by Sony, Rocket: Robot on Wheels.\n\nThe game’s setting takes place in the future, with its’ story revolving around the titular character, a robot on wheels named Rocket, who must thwart a hostile takeover of an in-construction theme park while engaging in a barrage of platforming, physics-based puzzle solving, mini-games, and vehicle segments along the way. Not much is known about the game’s development, but I managed to dig up some fairly intriguing stuff nonetheless. Originally, the game was supposed to be titled Sprocket, but the game’s final name ended up coming through due to a copyright dispute with a computer-based video game interfacing program called Game Sprockets. According to this notably rare prototype cartridge, it was made up on the spot when the game was nearing completion. The idea for a theme park setting materialized from the fond memories of lead programmer/designer Don Munsil, who described the initial proposal of the game as a hybrid between Super Mario 64 and a relatively obscure series of computer puzzle games by the name of The Incredible Machine. However, it was Bruce Oberg, Brian Fleming, and Chris Zimmerman who created the aforementioned proposal as well as Rocket. When the game was released, it was met with a overall decent, if not good, reception, although it has more or less joined its’ obscure fifth-generation 3D platforming brethren over the past several years. Despite this, it still retains a sizable cult following, with many claiming it as an overlooked diamond in the rough of the N64 library. The game’s inclusion in the “Top 20 Best N64 Games” in the 20th anniversary issue of Nintendo Power can be attributed as a potential factor in this.\n\nTo be continued…"
