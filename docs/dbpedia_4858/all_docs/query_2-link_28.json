        "text": "Rolo to the Rescue is a video game produced by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, released in 1992. The game is a two-dimensional action game with platforming elements, starring Rolo the elephant. Several other animal characters are playable once Rolo rescues them.\n\nRolo to the Rescue is about a young elephant who is trying to rescue his mother from the circus. Rolo also saves his animal friends along the way, and each animal has a special ability that is needed to successfully reach the end of each level. For example, the rabbit is able to jump really high, the squirrel can climb, the mole can dig, and the beaver can swim. MegaTech awarded the game 89%, while Mega placed the game at #31 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.\n\nNotes\n\nSega Genesis/Megadrive Controls:"
