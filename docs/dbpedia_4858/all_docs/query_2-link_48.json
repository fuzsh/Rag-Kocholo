        "text": "Welcome to the buy Sega Megadrive Games Section. This is a 100% complete collection of every European PAL Megadrive game released. All of the Sega Megadrive Games for sale are European / Australian PAL format and are primarily designed for the PAL Sega Megadrive or Sega Megadrive 2.\n\nHowever, many games will work on a US NTSC Sega Genesis without the use of a converter, but please make sure you check first. To run 100% of these games you will need either a PAL Sega Megadrive or Megadrive 2 Console, a modified Sega Genesis or a Converter. I can supply any of these, and they can be found in the Sega Megadrive Hardware or Sega Megadrive Consoles section. Please enquire beforehand if you are unsure about which games run on your console.\n\nWe have a great selection of Imported Japanese Sega Megadrive Games in the Sega Megadrive Imports section, and a small selection of Sega Genesis Games - a fair few US NTSC games never made it to PAL format so checkout this section for some unusual games you've never played before! All games have been cleaned as described in the Care of Second Hand Games section.\n\nIf you are a collector, why not download our free printable Sega Megadrive European PAL Games Checklist.\n\nThe difference between Console Passion and other retro gaming shops is that all the games I sell are complete, and in good condition. Unless stated otherwise, all the games below are boxed, with instructions. If you are not happy with the condition of a game you buy from me - send it back, and I'll give you a refund or a replacement."
