        "text": "Critical Role is a weekly livestreamed show that uses roleplaying game mechanics as a means to explore and develop stories from the vast fantasy world of Exandria, with sweeping narratives intricately woven through collaboration between Game Master Matthew Mercer and his fellow cast of veteran voice actors, including Ashley Johnson, Marisha Ray, Taliesin Jaffe, Travis Willingham, Sam Riegel, Laura Bailey, and Liam O’Brien. Adventure alongside Critical Role's Campaign 3 Thursdays at 7pm Pacific at twitch.tv/criticalrole and youtube.com/criticalrole. VOD is available immediately for Critical Role’s Twitch channel subscribers and available on YouTube at 12pm Pacific the following Monday. Audio from Critical Role is available the following Thursday on the Critical Role podcast network (Spotify, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, and more). Campaign 1 of Critical Role centered on the ragtag group of heroes known as Vox Machina as they traversed the continent of Tal'Dorei and beyond—from the glimmering coastal capital city of Emon to the dark and mysterious northern city of Whitestone, and across the sea to the ancient and blessed city of Vasselheim. Their epic journey across the world and even to other planes of existence left both Vox Machina and Exandria forever changed. Vox Machina consists of Pike Trickfoot, the Gnome Cleric (Ashley Johnson), Keyleth, the Half-Elf Druid (Marisha Ray), Percival “Percy” Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, the Human Gunslinger (Taliesin Jaffe), Grog Strongjaw, the Goliath Barbarian (Travis Willingham), Scanlan Shorthalt, the Gnome Bard and Taryon “Tary” Darrington, the Human Artificer (Sam Riegel), Vex’ahlia, the Half-Elf Ranger (Laura Bailey), and Vax’ildan, the Half-Elf Rogue (Liam O’Brien). The first campaign ended in November 2017 after 115 episodes. Campaign 2 followed the Mighty Nein from fledgling adventurers meeting in a small town tavern in Trostenwald, to accidental pirates sailing the Lucidian Ocean off the Menagerie Coast, to diplomats who daringly stood between Wildemount’s warring Dwendalian Empire and Kryn Dynasty, and finally to heroes, quietly fighting to save Exandria as they know it. The Mighty Nein consists of Yasha, the Aasimar Barbarian (Ashley Johnson), Beauregard, the Human Monk (Marisha Ray), Mollymauk Tealeaf, the Tiefling Blood Hunter and Caduceus Clay, the Firbolg Cleric (Taliesin Jaffe), Fjord, the Half-Orc Warlock/Paladin (Travis Willingham), Nott the Brave/Veth Brenatto, the Goblin/Halfling Rogue (Sam Riegel), Jester, the Tiefling Cleric (Laura Bailey), and Caleb Widogast, the Human Wizard (Liam O’Brien). The second campaign ended in June 2021 after 141 episodes.\n\nLearn more"
