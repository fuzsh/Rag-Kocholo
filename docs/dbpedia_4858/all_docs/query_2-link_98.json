Rolo's main task is to find and rescue four other animals – a squirrel, a rabbit, a beaver, and a mole. Once rescued, each of those friends become player-controlled characters with special abilities that can help the player along the way — the squirrel can climb, the rabbit jumps, the beaver swims, and the mole digs."
