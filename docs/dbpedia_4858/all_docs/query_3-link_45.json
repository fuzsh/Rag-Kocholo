        "text": "Martin Petri, who works with sustainability at IKEA, was in a rainforest in Borneo in 2016. It was hot and humid. The sound from surrounding wildlife resonated intensively in all directions. High up in a tree, he caught a glimpse of an orangutan dwelling – they were back. \"In 1983, a forest fire destroyed 18,500 hectares of rainforest\", says Martin. \"When Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA, heard about it he wanted to contribute to the restoration of the rainforest. That's why, since 1998, we've financed the project ‘Sow a seed’ which has led to more than 12,500 hectares of rainforest being replanted.\"\n\n\"Wild animals provide a sense of freedom, in particular for children living in urban environments\", says child psychologist Barbie Clarke, who has extensively researched about children and their development. The natural habitats of the orangutan, panda, tiger and other DJUNGELSKOG animals are threatened. This concerns many children. \"But they’re also curious and want to learn more about the animals\", explains Barbie. That’s why DJUNGELSKOG includes a number of books, too.\n\nHumans have the possibility to restore the natural habitats of animals and the biological diversity which provides balance in nature ─ just like in the rainforest Martin Petri visited. “’Sow a seed’ is one of the world’s largest rainforest projects, and has given involved researchers valuable knowledge which will be useful for other rainforests which have burned down or been felled\", explains Martin. More rainforest in Borneo means more orangutans swinging between the trees with their long arms. What a beautiful sight.\n\nYou can rest assured knowing that all our children’s products live up to the highest health and safety standards. We put our toys to the test – up against the toughest in the world (much tougher than any two-year-old). All so you can worry less and they can play more.\n\nWe know our soft toys should handle many years of love. That’s why we’ve chosen comfy materials, embroidered eyes, performed rigorous washing tests – and ensured that we test them for harmful chemicals. Simple to keep clean and fresh since they can be machined washed."
