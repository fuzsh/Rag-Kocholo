        "text": "EP 1 The Garden Party\n\nGranddad's perpetual fear that Huey and Riley will embarrass him in front of their new neighbors reaches paranoid heights when the family attends a stuffy, high-class garden party. The good news is: only one person gets shot.\n\nEP 3 Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner\n\nGranddad's bad luck with the ladies is about to change when he meets a very beautiful young woman. The boys disapprove when they discover that something is just \"different\" about her. Like the fact that she's a prostitute.\n\nEP 4 Granddad's Fight\n\nGranddad and Colonel Stinkmeaner have a beef. One man's blind. One man's feeble. Both are really, really old. Let \"The Slugfest in Woodcrest\" commence!\n\nEP 5 A Date with the Health Inspector\n\nDistrict Attorney and law abiding citizen Tom Dubois fits the description of the elusive \"X-Box Killer\" and is arrested. Huey has to find the real killer, before Tom is shipped off to \"real\" prison where he will most assuredly be made very, very uncomfortable.\n\nEP 6 The Real\n\nWhile Riley's convincing two reality shows that Granddad's blind and running a homeless shelter, Huey is being shadowed by a secret government agent. But is he real?\n\nEP 7 The Story of Gangstalicious\n\nRiley's favorite rapper Gangstalicious is shot and hospitalized in Woodcrest. When he goes to visit the rapper he finds more than he anticipated... like maybe rappers that make songs like \"Thugin' Luv\" aren't necessarily as tough as they seem. Go figure.\n\nEP 8 A Huey Freeman Christmas\n\nA well meaning, liberal teacher offers Huey the chance to direct the elementary school Christmas play, and Huey decides to release his vision onto the world: \"The Adventures of Black Jesus.\"\n\nEP 9 Return of the King\n\nWhen Martin Luther King comes out of a coma after 32 years and finds himself thrust into the 21st century and life in the post-September 11 era, his \"turn the other cheek\" philosophy quickly takes him from beloved national hero to despised terrorist sympathizer.\n\nEP 10 The Itis\n\nGranddad opens \"The Itis,\" the first and only soul food restaurant in Woodcrest. White people never expected it. They also didn't expect high cholesterol, heart disease and obesity.\n\nEP 12 Riley Wuz Here\n\nRiley's affinity for graffiti goes too far when neighbors wake up to giant murals on their homes. Maybe a sweet natured, psycho war vet art teacher can help reel him in.\n\nEP 13 Wingmen\n\nWhen Granddad's oldest friend dies, the Freemans go back home and both Granddad and Huey have to learn to put the past behind them.\n\nEP 1 ...Or Die Trying\n\nGranddad forces the kids to sneak into the long awaited sequel for Soul Plane 2. What follows is bootlegging, nunchucks, and twenty dollar popcorn - everything a day at the movies should be.\n\nEP 2 Tom, Sarah and Usher\n\nAfter a chance meeting with Usher at a restaurant puts a strain on Tom and Sarah's marriage, Tom turns to A Pimp Named Slickback to help rescue his relationship.\n\nEP 3 Thank You For Not Snitching\n\nA rash of home invasions has Woodcrest in a panic and the neighborhood watch on high alert. The Freemans are all too eager to mind their own business. But when Riley witnesses the theft of Granddad's precious car Dorothy, will he crack under questioning? We're not telling.\n\nEP 5 The Story of Thugnificent\n\nA superstar rap group moves in across the street and records a diss record about Granddad after a neighborly disagreement escalates into full blown rap beef.\n\nEP 6 Attack of the Killer Kung Fu Wolf Bitch\n\nGranddad invites a total stranger to the house for the weekend and has the nerve to act surprised when she turns out to be completely insane.\n\nEP 7 Shinin'\n\nRiley finally gets what he's always wanted - a platinum and diamond chain - only to have it snatched by the local bully. Afraid of disappointing his new crew, Riley will stop a nothing to recover his chain and rep.\n\nEP 9 The Invasion of the Katrinas\n\nWhen family displaced by hurricane Katrina show up looking for a place to stay, Granddad does what anyone would do - try to find a way to get rid of them as quickly as possible.\n\nEP 10 Home Alone\n\nWhen Granddad takes a much needed vacation from the boys, Huey takes control of the house but has to contend with a vicious insurgency from Riley.\n\nEP 12 The Story of Catcher Freeman\n\nThree very different versions of a slave revolt led by Huey and Riley's great great great great great great grandparents. Who says the 1860's couldn't be fun?\n\nEP 13 The Story of Gangstalicious, Part 2\n\nGangstalicious is back with a new hit song, a new clothing line, but the same old secret. Gayness ensues.\n\nEP 14 The Hunger Strike\n\nHuey organizes a boycott of BET and gets some high-profile help. Will it be enough to bring the world's worst cable network to it's knees? We can only hope.\n\nEP 15 The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show\n\nA BET reality show forces racist handyman Uncle Ruckus to accept the truth about his own blackness. The show and man begin to quickly fall apart.\n\nEP 1 It's a Black President, Huey Freeman\n\nRemember \"Yes We Can\"? No, you don't? A German documentary follows the Freeman family from the election to the Inauguration of the country's first Black President, giving us a look back at the hope and change that already feels like ancient history.\n\nEP 2 Bitches to Rags\n\nThugnificent has seen better days. Auto-tune, rap beef, nothing can stop the IRS when his new album tanks. Faced with the horror of getting a real job, Otis Jenkins takes some pretty desperate measures to stay afloat. Is there life after rap death?\n\nEP 3 The Red Ball\n\nWhen the Chinese call in some old debts, Ed Wuncler is forced to gamble all of Woodcrest's economic fortunes on a kickball game with its sister city, Wushung, China. Kickball legend Huey Freeman is to come out of self-imposed exile from the game to do battle with the red ball one last time. It's a kickball game to end all kickball games.\n\nEP 4 Stinkmeaner 3: The Hateocracy\n\nColonel H. Stinkmeaner had no family and no friends... but he did have a mean crew. Three of Stinkmeaner's old crew arrive in town to exact payback on the Freeman family. Is revenge a dish best served old?\n\nEP 5 Smokin' with Cigarettes\n\nIf it's fun to do bad things, then Riley is having the best time ever with juvenile felon Lamilton Taeshawn. But when Lamilton wants to prove he has the \"juice\", the good times come to a shocking end. Will Riley \"know the ledge\"? Well anyone get these movie references?\n\nEP 6 The Fund-Raiser\n\nRiley takes over the school candy bar hustle and floods the block with sugar.

Will the sweet life take Riley under?\n\nEP 7 Pause\n\nGranddad is cast as the leading man by mega-superstar of stage and screen, Winston Jerome.

But when a riot breaks out, Tom has to get the kids, and his delicate backside, out of jail in one piece.\n\nEP 9 The Story of Lando Freeman\n\nThere's a new handyman in the neighborhood undercutting Uncle Ruckus... which is all good for Granddad and his garden until the man claims to be his long lost son, Lando. Will Granddad take responsibility and be a father to his child? Not without a talk show paternity test...\n\nEP 10 The Lovely Ebony Brown\n\nGranddad finds a Black woman so beautiful and charming not even Ruckus can hate her. Ebony Brown is perfect in every way . . . so is this the end of Granddad's long, sad, desperate search for a woman? Not if he can help it.\n\nEP 11 Mr. Medicinal\n\nAfter a health scare, Granddad discovers the amazing life benefits of medical marijuana. But when Granddad suddenly becomes a balanced, well-adjusted person, Huey and Riley immediately know something is up.\n\nEP 12 The Fried Chicken Flu\n\nIs this how it all ends? When a fast food promotion crosses with a plague of biblical proportions, society spins out of control faster than you can say \"white meat only.\" Will Huey Freeman's elaborate end-of-the-world survival plan stand up to the ultimate test? Will any of us ever get to eat fried chicken again?!\n\nEP 13 The Color Ruckus\n\nIf you loved \"The Color Purple,\" and can't get enough of \"Precious,\" we present an equally powerful, emotionally gripping story of people senselessly beating on each other. Uncle Ruckus's family comes to town and Ruckus must settle some old business with his father. It's a tale of abuse, and triumph, and... actually no, it's just a tale of abuse.\n\nEP 14 It's Goin' Down\n\nA terror attack near Woodcrest is imminent, and domestic terrorist Huey Freeman is the main suspect. With super-agent Jack Flowers on his tail and Ed and Rummy on the loose, can anyone save the day?\n\nEP 1 Pretty Boy Flizzy\n\nR&B singer and bad boy \"Pretty Boy Flizzy\" comes to town, and is arrested for armed robbery. Tom agrees to be Flizzy's lawyer in exchange for relationship advice. But Flizzy's guidance might have too harsh of a beat. Michael B. Jordan guest stars as Flizzy.\n\nEP 2 Good Times\n\nThese are not \"good times\" for Granddad. He owes millions of dollars on his house to Eddie Wuncler (son of Ed Wuncler) who has some unique ideas of how Granddad can pay him back. And with Eddie appearing more like a gangster than a businessman, times are about to get worse.\n\nEP 3 Breaking Grandad\n\nIt may not be meth, but the explosive hair product the Freemans are selling is just as dangerous. And even more lethal may be the black market of the hair-care industry run by Boss Willona.\n\nEP 4 Early Bird Special\n\nGranddad is hired by not-so-sweet grandmothers at a nursing home to escort lonely ladies. But this Woodcrest Gigolo is in for a surprise when he finds that the job is not as sexy as it sounds.\n\nEP 5 Freedom Ride or Die\n\nCivil Rights pioneers: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X... Robert Freeman? A young reluctant Granddad is held as an unwilling freedom rider by Revered Sturdy Harris, on a trip through the racist South.

Dennis Haysbert guest stars as Reverend Sturdy Harris.\n\nEP 6 Grandad Dates a Kardashian\n\nGranddad co-stars on a reality show when he begins dating Kardashia, a newly discovered Kardashian sister. While Riley and Granddad love all of the swag they're receiving, Huey is more dubious of this new Kardashian's intentions. Can the Freemans keep up with Kardashia?\n\nEP 7 Freedomland\n\nThe Freemans find that Eddie Wuncler's new slavery theme park \"Freedomland\" may be a bit too authentic, when they are trapped there and forced to be slaves. Huey must find a way to uproot them from this situation.\n\nGranddad's New iPhone\n\nS 4 EP 8\n\nSiri seems to know quite a bit about the Freemans."
