The power of the ST allows you to run \"serious\" applications as well as playing games, and the ST system is flexible enough to allow you to expand as you develop your interests and expertise in different applications. One of the real advantages that the Atari ST has to offer is the sheer range and depth of software support. From word processors, spreadsheets and databases through to professional DTP and CAD systems the $T user is spoilt for choice. In MIDI applications the Atari ST has been the choice of professional recording studios and the software support for ST MIDI is awesome. If you thought that computers were all about playing games you 've been missing out on the real potential that you and your computer have.

Wfiile Ocean on The Simpsons lice- nce, and the NES and Game Boy versions are only avail- able through grey Import, it's good news to hear of an arcade game based on Sky TV's most pop- ular progra- mme (around a , million viewers watch it each weak).

Indeed, every computer and console must have its own version if it is going to be seen as a machine that can be taken ■ seriously (even the Super Famicom!). The problem is that no-one in this tndus- try, including myself, has an attention span of longer that 15 sec- onds. So when a seri- ous-minded game comes along that actually needs some time spent getting to know it the game scares us journos wit- less. Populous only received good reviews because everyone got together and said they'd all give it good ratings if no-one actually had to play it Dent be footed by the in- depth reviews of Powermonger either if you look at the by-lines you'll find they are nearly all an anagram of Simon Jeffrey, Electronic Arts' PR man. He had to do the reviews because we were ail far too frightened of it. But everyone gave a sigh of relief when It seemed as if the PC version was the last we'd see of Populous, But then along came a Mega Drive version - which was not too bad because everyone could re-hash their old Amiga reviews due to the game being a straight conversion - and now comes the Master System. Being an 8- bit machine, you'd think this version would be dead easy to write about, but what do the programmers go and do but Increase the number of worlds tenfold. Now to me this sounds a little excessive, I mean by the time you have finished playing the 4,500 extra worlds you wifl proba- bly have to rent a life and buy friends because you won't have any left after being a hermit for six years completing nil the worlds. SIMON FREEMAN: SAY ANYTHING Do you know the way to San Jose? Straight down Highway 101 What was the first thing you ever did for Tecmagik (apart from selling your soul)? Populous is my first full project but I helped on Pac-Mania to make sure it was on schedule. Being such a busy chap, why did you decide to inflict 5,000 worlds upon us. compared with the original's 500? Why 500? Dan Duncalf made an arbitrary choice, the kind that you make at three or four in the morning How long has it taken to do that many worlds? Did you need the assis- tance of others? It has taken seven months. Dan Duncalf and Muffy Vashele here in California helped out and Peter Molyneux at Bullfrog [the original's program- mers] has been very helpful, as has Josh Ellis at Eleclronic Arts. Populous is obviously the height of your career, what have you done in the past? Commando on Amstrad and some work for Mastertronic, Firebird and Agtivisign. The first thing I ever did was for DK Ironies The first things that I actually got said were some conversions I did of Psychadeiia for Jeff Minier. Q: Why im on «l*pr«mt how a trunk? RAZEJUNE1991 i ) I \\ This number is somewhat excused by the fact that they have included the Promised Lands which were released as a supple- mentary disk some months after the original. Extra worlds which you will have never seen before include the Future World and the bizarre Bitmap World (although I haven't found a Speedbaif machine in it yet). Unlike the Mega Drive version, the control system has been changed to make it more console friendly. The close-up map moves at a ridiculous speed, and the push of button 2 will cycle you through every section on the screen, making it far easier to find your way around the screen. The Master System version of Populous is the only one not to be released by Electronic Arts. The firm behind it all are Tecmagik. who have just recently launched into the MS market with Pac- Mania, The Brit- ish company also have Shadow of the Beast in produc- tion and hopefully a Sega version of this should be out for the summer. So all you \"lucky\" Master System owners have now got the chance to own the game that everyone else owns but never plays. You lucky people. Populous for the Master Sys- tem will be released by Tecmagik in April, with price details to be ann- ounced. ■ behind the expanded Master System version of Populous is man. He lives and works in a place called Belmont, USA - its somewhere between San Francisco and San Jose. Tils Is also where Tecmagik, producers of the Master System version of Populous, hart their US Offices. RUE raised the questions that everyone else was afraid '\" J know this is a toughie, but the readers want to know: How old are you? [Long pause,] Erm. [Even longer pause.] Erm, 21. But bare in mind that I have been working in computers for sik years, and I only started [program- ming games] after I left university. So I guess you'll be looking for an exciting game to convert next. Something with payability, addictive qualities... The immediate future means a conversion of Shadow of the Beast for the Waster System. After that I'll be doing two more conversions for Tecmagik, which are still under wraps.

The only limitation is memo- ry, which means 512K owners will have limited sound effects. For The Assembly Line, having Ricardo Pinto (one of the original designers behind Carrier Command} as the game designer is something of a welcome night- mare. His fertile imagination just never stops, and he is continually pressing the programmers to try and squeeze just one more idea in before the next report back to US Gold.

BIG IN JAPAN Having auditioned for JSTV, but been turned down for refusing to get his hair cut in traditional samurai styling, Shintaro Kanaoya painted his hair green and pretended to be Edd the Duck. Deciding that he would never be featured in a game, let atone get his own TV series, he decided to hit the saki cask and write of his latest findings in Japan. Mioasama yokoso. I'll dive right in with the flavour of the decade, Suzy Uki... er, the Super Famicom, and a very Japanese game indeed called Ganbare Gasman. This roughly translates to 'good luck Goemon' or 'break a leg Goernon' or even 'give 'em ore from me Goernon ol' pal.' In case you're wondering, Goernon is a ronim This creator© is a samurai (Japanese warrior of noble blood, good with a sword, honourable. dependable and now sadly extinct) without a master. In his previous incarnation on the NES, Goernon ran around medieval Japan and kicked cop ass. He's a real '90s hero Anyway, this time Goernon wan- ders round medieval Japan, ihrough cities and Ihe countryside, through grave yards and temples, up hills, down dales arid so on. The object of the game is as ever to rescue some pathetic princess who was stupid enough to get caught. Here, in this silly task who. as Goernan are joined by Ebisumaru, a ninja (Japanese spy, amazing skills, invisible,, mysterious and also extinct despite what Sho Kosugi would have you believe). The game is two-player simultane- ous - both Goernan and Ebisumaru can be controlled, so you'll be able to beat each other up. However, in the interest of progress, you'll be able to combine (you really don't want to know!) and become twice as strong. No surprises in the graphics department; they are absolutely stun- ning. Very colourful and humourous (like Gig in Japan). Also on the way for the Famicom is Ultrarnan. The game is taken from Hhe TV series of the same name and \\ involves a group of superheroes. I' They're normally human beings, but with the use of a magic torch and the words \"showalchi\" Ihey become super big, super strong, super heroes. And they're ready to protect the planet against V^ hostile monsters. However, if you can see through their cos- tumes, they're a group of actors wearing plastic and rubber suits who go out to fight other actors in rubber monster suits. You go one on one against sirange and fabulous crea- tures Uftramaris basically a beat-'em-up Namto's Work!

Of course, <l may seem to you that with all these mega moves, wiping out a few monsters should be easy But there's a catch. Ultramar can only stay as Ultramar for 180 seconds. Mot enough time to hard boil an egg, but just enough to make some pot noodles. The real exciting games are yet to come on the Super Famicom. A marathon (?) of sports games are coming your way I wont go detail about any of them as they're the sort of games youTI have seen before But keep an eye out for Super Professional Baseball. BaMe Dodgebatl (featuring some UHraman characters), Pro Soccer (which is actually a straight conversion of Kick Off 2). Super Ultra Baseball. Ganba League (cuie baseball game), Augusta National Golf Game, and Jumbo Ozaki's Hole In One. SONIC THE SEGA Moving on to the Mega Dnve, about which there isn't much to say. After ail the hype and anticipation regarding Shining and the Darkness, there isn't another big game to fill its shoes in the short term. The only medium- sized one on the hc-nzgn is Nadia of the Strange Sea. This is based on a TV cartoon show. Mamco, its makers have reputedly come up with an entirely new story. The cartoon and game are based in a fantasy world inhabited by weird machines, lads in In 1 970 a Teaoin swcillowecl 255 livecjolcffiih. A glasses and berets, and girls in biki- nis and waistcoats. It's another RPG with very few instructions necessary to get you from one place to the next. The only other game thai looks vaguely interesting is the Warren Beatly exercise in how not to make a film. I am of course talking about Dick Tracy, which is already on sale (and reviewed in this issue's RAZE). The game's colourful, done in the prime colours that Beatty wanted to use, and there are a lot of naff between-stage lines like \"Big Boy sent me to meet this train, Tracy! Now you're going to meet a bullet!\" Or what about his pearl \"...It's from the train yard to the jail for you, Itchy!\" One game due for release later this year that bolhers me is Sonic the Hedgehog. Now I may be wrong, but I thought hedgehogs were sup- posed to have needles on their bod- ies and get run over by Volvos. Sonic however is blue, wears white gloves and looks curiously (ike Tom from the Tom and Jerry cartoon In fee*, if any- thing, he's- a cat, but the fad that he crawls underground led me to think he's a mole, He is not however a hedgehog and if you see someone from Sega (for it is they) could you point that out lo them. The game, however, looks good and is due out m July. Just afore I venture into PC Engine territories, a word on forth- coming Game Gear releases. Mickey Mouse - Castle of illusion (lit- tle action game featuring I he rat that F A M I C M GETS CD-ROM Belore leaving tie Super Famicom lor another month, let me briefly tell you what I know ol the Super Famicom CD-ROM drive II looks as though there is one coming out possibly this year, and possibly under E40D Trie news was broken by trie Japanese equivalent ol lire Financial Times and has nol been denied by Nintendo or Sony. Sony? Whales Sony got lo do with it? Well, they're helping to make it - just as they did with the Super Famicom sound chip.

BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN Right, with the Engine out of the way, I'll say a few things about the Game Boy. It's small, green and black, and it still kicks the crap out of the Lynx (even the new one). Apart from that there are two new releases for it. Family Jockey is the first, It's a conversion of an NES game, one of the most popular of the Namco family sports series. This one. not altogeth- er surprisingly, is to do with horse racing. You race a horse by whipping it. The idea is to whip the horse by the correct amount; a little harder when it starts to stow, but nol to much otherwise it loses energy. There's also the occasional jump to negotiate. You can bet on the out- come of races - even the ones you're racing in.

Yup, that also happens to be the same address as the edito- rial for DAZE, which can only mean good things tor it, right? The price lor over 200 pages packed with tips an nearly every Sega game you could imagine is just £9.39. What a bargain. m across it, Ishtdo is based on an ancient Chinese game, played by peasants for centuries past. You basically match either symbol or shape to empty the pouch and score as many points as possible Strangely addictive (catch the 16-bit review m issue three), but alas no word as yet of any impending Master System ver- sion. A Mega Drive shaot-'em-up that is receiving a lot of jitter t on in Japan at Ihe moment is Verytex, a vertically scrolling little number that features more power*ups than Ben Johnson's gym locker. There seem to be a huge number of huge end of level bosses, and the backgrounds are packed with detail and colour. Using several layers of parallax scrolling, it produces the vertiginous effect of some extremely deep trenches - not for the weak stomached. Keep an eye out for something called Aiisia Dragoon for the Mega Drive. A rather hassled looking young lady takes on hordes of steaming zombies, scythe- wielding eunuchs and fire-throwing harem girls. All Geared up! Now that Mickey Mouse has bound- ed onto the Master System from the Mega Drive, it will shortly be arriving in fine fettle on the Game Gear. Looking, understandably, not quite as good as the Mega Drive version, rt is certain to follow the MS version and storm into a high position in the charts. In fact, as I write Mickey Mouse has just hit the number one spot in the Gallup Individual Format chart, which means it sold more on the Sega than any other game on any other machine in that week. My prediction for the next \"storming\" of the charts is Sonic Th9 Hedgehog. The bases will soon be loaded when a new baseball game comes to a Game Gear near you. The working title for it is Baseball Stars, although this will probably be changed when it reaches the streets in June, The view is taken from behind the batter, with screens flicking up revealing runners on the third and first bases. If a player is trying to steal from Ihe second base, he can be seen from the main scene behind the pitcher. The whole game is very visual and looks impressive, even on ihe small Game Gear screen. If pocket base- ball is what you want, then you'd find it hard to better Baseball Stars. No Japanese con- sole svouid be complete wifhoul its Own ve-s on of baseball.

ASSAULT SUIT LfYNOS Mega Drive To get all the weapons make sure that you have exactly 2800 points at the end of level one. The only way to get this score is to shoot no-one but the end of level boss.

It is hoped that all four titles will also be out on the Game Boy before Christmas. . It's true, Nintendo have gone completely potty! h»o. they haven't sold the Super Mario Bros rights to Sega or made the Game Boy Lynx-compatible; it's worse than that. Nintendo have actually announced that they're going to increase the amount of Game Boy releases! (Surely this would warrant a check on Nintendo to see if they're okay.) It's true, they are actually going to blitz the machine with over 25 new titles through the summer. These include the dangerously addictive Dr Mario. Nintendo World Cup, Ghessmaster, Burai Fighter Deluxe, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, RoboGop and Batman. The madness continues as the NES is guaranteed 4-5 releases a month, Imminent titles include Days of Thunder (much better than the I6*bit version), Gauntlet II and Al Unser Jr's Turbo Racing. Super Mario 3 is also lined up for release later in the summer. The whole NES bandwagon will be supported by some new TV ads featuring Sotar Jetman, Gremlins It anti the Double Dragon duo.

You NES owners deserve some underhand dodges on the turtley addictive game too, so here's a few pointers.

Also, when one of the turtles has the boomerangs, you can share them around by throwing a couple and then switching lo another member of the froggy four- some. So says D Fonseca of Bucks Horn Oak (1) in Surrey. Yet more help comes from L Fenech in Battersea (woof) who foils Mouser. Use Donatello and press start twice quickly when Mouser opens his mouth for the last time. This wilt slap him letting out those annoying little Mouse rs for a few seconds. However, Joyce Duff from Heathall in Dumfries has a different approach. She says that Mouser must be destroyed with the shurikens. She also says you can get Technodrome with the boomerangs (found at the top-left of the map, in a building). BATMAN NES Joyce Duff (again) helps out with that Joker. Wipe the smile off his face by using the Batarangs. When Joker raises his arm to fire lightning, move back an inch and lire like mad!'

Whaddya mean the Game Boy's ten quid cheaper? Do me a favour and cut your head off with a saber. Get real! The Lynx is where it's at. &tf ^tc&vtd \"?0&**t{e4*<i Let me clear up some confusion first. The Lynx is now available at three price points: £129.99 - this pat* boasts the Lynx, ComLynx, AC power adaptor and California Games cartridge. £99.99 - released just a couple of months ago, this pack features the Lynx, ComLyn* and AC power adap- tor. There is no bundled game car- tridge. £79.99 - the all new pack containing just the Lynx. While the price might have cha- nged, ihe hardware and design hasn't. You still get the same Lynx that was launched over a year. The new style Lynx men- tioned a couple of issues back is still only available in the States and is unlikely to make an appearance over here until Sega do something drastic with the Game Gear. By all accounts Virgin aren't going to have any Quantities until at least September, so that's probably when you'll get to see the Lynx II for ihe first time. The new price point of £79.99 makes the Lynx the best value hand held without a doubt. Compare it to the Nintendo Game Boy which, although £10 cheaper, only offers monochrome graphics, a slow pro- cessor and pitiful sound. Even the yet-to-be-released Sega Game Gear looks overpriced and underpowered compared to the Lynx, THE FIDELITY ULTIMATE CHESS CHALLENGE Telega mes/Atari • £34.99 # Lynx When I first saw this I thought it was some new variation on that recent hit draughts, The eight by eight board was identical... however,, when I took a closer look at the pieces I realised that this was a different game alto- gether. And what a corker it is too. Each of the two players has 16 pieces: eight pawns, two castles (or rooks), two kftghte. (wo bishops, a king and a queen. I have to assume that the designs tar these pieces are symbolic because neither the king or queen look anything lice our reigning monarchs: although the king displays a certain likeness to that wooden quality that Prince Ph*p often shows. The arrangement is thus: on the back row the far edges are taken up by the rooks, rode them are the knights, followed Sy the bishops and against your opponent and trap his king in the process, This no-win situ- ation is known as a checkmate (sounds more like an over-familiar request for a bill in a cafe). You can use your pieces to capture your opponent's and ihus make his king more vulnerable to attack. With 32 pieces on a 64 piece board, things can get pretty complex. The strategy element soon shines through and it is easy to find yourself laking as much as Ihree to four min- utes on each of your moves. Once you've got over the initial barrier of Ihe complex rules it soon becomes very addictive. And the cur- sor control of the moves is as simple as it could be, However, if the rules were simplified a little it could easily have mass-market potential. Who knows, within a few years time it may Tlw game can be viewed from 2-D and 3-D perspectives.

In front of that lot is a row of ihe e*ght pawns. This lay- out makes me wonder whether the game is based on a military battle- field; the theory fits m wet) with the strategy element thai soon becomes apparent. This game shows definite potential. Each of the pieces has its own set of moves (see box). Initially they are difficult to master, and this could put some off the game. However, a note- pad wi(h the moves written down and a lot of perseverance will soon have you enjoying it. The object is la mount a campaign well have created a big enough fol- lowing to warrant a World Championship.. Remember, you saw.* now what is it, chess here first. I think you all know where I'm coming from. Jibes aside, chess is a wonderful game and has been superbly implemented In The Fidelity Ultimate Che$$ Challenge. Being based on ihe latest most powerful chess playing technology from Fidelity, you're assured very competi- tive gameplay. For those that enjoy chess, this game is whole heartedly recommended- Julian Boardman Blackout from California Games is reputed to be very near completion. It's a one player game in which you must solve a 3-D construction puzzle- Think of Welltris (the 3-D follow up to Tetris) and you'll get the picture, • NFL Football is another title which looks set to be released imminently. Up to four players can participate in this American football game licensed by the NFL. The game requires you to the Lynx both horizontally and vertically which is something of a first. • Tournament Cyberbalt 2072 is a Lynx adaptation of the Tengen co in -op. Up to four players can join in the foot-flinging, fist- flying, dirt-dragging version of American football played in the future by huge robots. • Scrapyard Dog is am Atari one-player original in which Louie (whoever he might be) loses his dog to kidnappers. On collecting enough money you must walk through the worst part of town to deliver the dosh. Apparently the game is much like Super Mario in terms of payability. • Viking Child the platform romp, which was reviewed in its 16-bit format in RAZE issue two, is being produced by UK developers I magi tec and looks set to be a cracker when it's released in the next few months. • Ninja Garden - the Tecmo coin-op voted arcade game of the year in 1990 - is set to storm onto the Lynx next month. This one or two-player beat-'em-up is a real graphical feast and will be the first of its genre to hit the Lynx. • Turbo Serb is another Atari original for one or two players, Aliens have infested Earth's oceans and its up to you to clear the water ways. Using a vehicle that can fly as well as dive to the ocean depths, you must take on all comers. • Krazy Ace Miniature Golf is the second Telegames title due in the next month or so. Essentially it's a 3-D mini golf game with a course designer thrown in. A further two games are in development Desfrucfmn Derby and Puzzle (both working titles) - and both are due for release this year. • Pac-Land, APB, Vindicators, Stun Runner. GeoDuel, World Class Soccer, Grid Runner, Toki, Rolling Thunder and Checkered Flag are also due for release this year. LYNX HACK SHACK Thanks for all those fabulous tips that hove been flooding in.

CALIFORNIA GAMES If you really hate birds as much as Matthew Rains in South Australia, why not go surfing on the bird which flies past near the end of your surfing session? All you have to do is achieve a pathetic score of around 500 to 700 points, wait until there are only a few seconds remaining and then leap to the right side of the screen. If you have enough speed, the right timing and a good deal of luck you should land on top of the bird and both of you will float gently off the screen. About as useful as a pin in a balloon factory. Also, in the surfing section Jose two lives immediately, stay on the board while the counter ticks down and then steer the board off the bot- tom of the screen when the timer hits three to Jose the last life, When the time runs out,., well, see for yourself . MS PAC-MAN A few months ago I printed a tip for giving you a speed-up. However, it proved a little tricky to implement. Here's a far simpler way of achieving the same result. Pause the game and then press the buttons option 1, A and Option 1 in sequence. Unpause the game and hit button B during the game to boost Mis Pac-Mlan's speed. To gain an extra five lives once per game pause the game and press the following buttons in sequence: Option 1, B, B, A, A, Option 1, Unpause the game to continue with five lives. It Is best to do this trick when you've only got one life left. ZARLOR MERCENARY Here's a stage by stage guide to beating the game courtesy of Paul Proctor of Chichester In Sussex: Stage one {Cad mar Desert) - Select Landru with power shots. Use the level to amass as much money as possible. At the begin- ning of the level collect the laser and autof ire/speed -up Don't drop any megabombs and try not to lose a life. To beat the mothers hip fly In circles around It using the laser to blast the panels off it. In the shop at the end buy side shooters, wing cannons and megabombs, Stage two (Meson Swamp] - this is actually the hardest level. Make sure you pick up the super shield and health globes. As soon as the mothership appears drop two megabombs to destroy it. In the shop buy one wing cannon, one sideshooter and as many megabombs as possible. Stage three (Docrit Sea) - stay to the right of the screen for the entire level; this protects you from the alien trains that race down the screen. Shoot all stationary ships to get maximum cash. At the end of this level there are three moth- ershlps. To destroy them, sit on the hole in the centre and pound the fire buttons as the enemies appear. Between each level is a health globe which you must pick up. If you loose a life replace it in the shop and buy as many megaboi as possible. Stage four (Sedimor Do- mes) - on this level there are loads of megabombs; . pick them up. To kill the mothership drop five meg- abombs. At the shop buy a life and as , | many mega- bombs as you can afford. Stage five (Mardic Ice) - pick up all the globes. There are three huge snow mobiles at the end of the level. Wait until you can see all of the first one and drop five or six megabombs. The other two will die in the process. Buy lives until you have six in total and spend the rest on megabombs. Stage six (Cedamite City) - dodge enemy fire and don't drop any megabombs until you see the mothership. Drop all your megabombs to complete the level and the game. Phew! ROADBLASTERS Ensure your multiplier is up to the maximum 10 and then crash into one of the cannons that appear on the sides of the road. When you get to the end of the level you will be awarded 20,000 bonus points. Incidentally, this hidden trick also works on the coin^op version. RAMPAGE During a multiplayer game it's possible for you ts pick up an explosive and prevent it going off by looking upwards. You can throw the explosive down and then, when you want it to go off, look downwards. SUMEWORLD Enter the summary section of Slimeworld (you can do this by pressing A or B, moving the joy- pad up button until the summary screen appears, and then press- ing A or 8) and keep pressing up until you get to the screen telling you what happens when you get slimed. Press Option 1 when you get to this stage to enter a zit popping section game. A green zit appears on screen which grows when you hit button A or B. The idea is to make the zit so large that it bursts. If you do SHIELD nothing the zit shrinks. A two player comlynx version is also available. The idea in this instance is to make your zit grow will reducing the size of your opponents. £ 1 Rood Blasters 51 2 Paper Boy -ri 3 Robo Squash Ml a 4 Zalor Mercenary P *r 5 Klax. 6 Blue Lightning 7 Gauntlet St B Gates Of Zendocon 9 Electro Cop 10 Slime World wm ADVERTISEMENT WIN THIS HO EMDURO RACER ARCADE GAME!

Chuck Rock is one of the old breed. Despite the fact he treats his wife like a toilet seat and sits around all day drinking lager, TfTrrV ■fc*-:'*i : m: r/mm.i S^ mk Chuck still loves her. This is brought home to us by the very fact that he decides to go on a mammoth (geddit?) quest to find his wife after she is kidnapped by Gary Gritter. Gntter has abducted the beauti- ful Ophelia Rock because his Level iWe lakes place above and below water, giving Chuck the chance to go blue in the tote while fighting off hordes of giant jel- lyfish. tasks, so they fight hard to get her back. Or starve. On finding that his wife has gone missing whilst hanging out the washing, Chuck immediately sets out to find his dearly beloved. Forgetting that wash-day is always a bit colder on the flesh than pther days of the week. Chuck Rock runs straight out of the back door without any clothes an. Amid much blushing and hand move- ment, the burly caveman jumps behind a bush and covers himself with a few leaves, the obelisks and take out any creature they hit, or place them correctly, and use them to climb to a ledge that would otherwise be inaccessible. But wait, there's more. Because he carries the rocks on his head, Chuck can use them as a shield to prevent him being hit by objects dropped from above I ngenio us- Over five levels, taking you halfway around the world, old Chuck has to be guided through what could easily become some- thing of a cult game. The idiosyn- cratic gamepilay and a host of chuckle-worthy features ensure that Chuck Rock will at least stand out from the crowd. Although Core Design do admit that the platform genre has now been done to death, and they promise Chuck Rock will be their last plat- form game - and what a way to go out!

If you fail to beat the computer trucks, you will forfeit a credit, of which you have three. At the end of a race you can spend your winnings (and any money you picked up on Ihe track) on new tyres, suspension, nitros etc, Nitros are the mosl important as they give you a much- needed burst of speed when trailing behind the com- puter trucks. The tracks are a lot bigger and tougher than any of the 16-foit ver- sions of the game so don't expect an easy nde. The only problem is that the responsiveness of the trucks is very poor.
