        "text": "I was really excited for this very modern take on the myth of Persephone & Demeter! Cory is an 18-year-old camp counselor who finds herself at loose ends at the end of the summer. A camper's wealthy father, the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who owns a private island off the coast of Maine, offers her a gig as a live-in nanny for a month while his ex-wife recovers from the birth of her child with her new husband. Cory rather gormlessly accepts, & more or less disappears, as she has no wireless service on the island, & is sick of her mother's constant meddling anyway. This causes her mother, Emer, the head of an agricultural NGO that has failed to live up to the promises it made on its genetically modified \"magic rice,\" to basically spiral out of control.\n\nThe conceit here is that Cory is Perspehone (also known as Kore in some myths), the maiden; the pharma dude, Rolo Picazo, is Hades, king of the Underworld, who steals Persephone away (Picazo means \"magpie\" in Italian, which is a bird known for stealing shiny objects); & Emer is Demeter (the goddess of harvest & agriculture). So the symbolism is very thick here.\n\nUnfortunately, Lyon's may have become so enthralled by her symbolism that she forgot to develop much of a plot, because this goes more or less exactly the way you think it would, save for pretty much everything Emer does. & everything Emer does is totally unearned & strictly for plot reasons, but it's so unbelievable & incomprehensible as anything a normal person would do that it's hard to validate it as a real plot. Emer goes on a quest to \"rescue\" Cory from Rolo's island, but it's never really clear why Cory needs such a dramatic rescue, why Emer should be the one to do it, why Emer should do it in this particularly insane way, or even really how she pulls it off.\n\nI do think the writing in this book is quite beautiful. The book is a vibe, for sure. But if you are coming here for a carefully-constructed or even a coherent plot, you are going to be disappointed. Truth be told, I gave this book 3.5 stars & it got dinged pretty hard on factors like \"logic\" & \"plot\". But I ranked it high as far as \"atmosphere\" & \"writing quality\" (meaning that there were some beautiful turns of phrase, the writing flowed & churned like the North Atlantic itself). So depending on what you want in a book, you could love it or hate it. Personally, I'm glad I read it because I will take beautiful writing over a taut, suspenseful plot any day. & honestly, Emer's bizarre personal breakdown kind of made me laugh (though I don't think it was supposed to).\n\nI want a prequel about Rolo's marriage to his kids' mom, because frankly, she seems infinitely too cool for him.\n\nBlog:\n\nI’ve seen some reviews from folks who entered this book clearly not knowing anything about the myth of Demeter and Persephone. I think that’s a mistake. Knowing the myth helps you know what vibes to expect from this book at least. It helps match the book properly with the readers who might enjoy it. So if you’re not already familiar, take a moment to read a quick summary. Ok. This is not a romance. This is a story of a young girl who gets abducted by the literal god of the underworld and tricked into eating something while there that will make her always have to return. It’s also the story of her mother’s desperate quest to find her.\n\nThis is a modern retelling devoid of fantasy. It takes the myth and places it in our modern world. Hades is a pharmaceutical company executive. A billionaire. He’s currently going through a legal battle to do with his very addictive pain pills. (He’s clearly an allusion to the Sackler family.) Personally, I loved the choice of a billionaire drug pusher as the stand-in for Hades.\n\nPersephone is Cory. A just barely turned 18-year-old whose high-achieving mother wants desperately for her to go to college but who did not get in anywhere she applied. She and her mother are not getting along right now. (There are reasons for this rift beyond college that are a spoiler and are revealed later in the book.) She goes to be a camp counselor where she went to summer camp in essentially a huff. At the end of summer camp, the father of one of the children shows up to pick up the child and asks her to come to his private island to nanny the son and a daughter for a month. She has to sign an NDA. She cannot tell her mother where, exactly she is. This is the getting ripped into the underworld bit. nstead of the pomegranate seeds, what Cory is given is, naturally, the pain killing drugs. Her mother, after a bit of time and one very weird phone call, cannot shake the feeling something is wrong, and drops everything to go after her daughter. It’s kind of Taken but with a mom.\n\nI really enjoyed the vibes of this book. It oozed danger even when nothing super insidious was happening. While things do escalate, for a lot of the book it’s not that anything is technically wrong, it just feels wrong. It’s an art form to be able to mimic that gut reaction in fiction. This was one of the stronger parts of the book. I also really enjoyed a part where different plot points came together in what one could have called a coincidence, but also could be called the gods interfering. It was astutely (and kindly) done.\n\nHowever. This book chose to never use quotation marks for dialogue. Not once. This is a stream of consciousness writing technique. It’s becoming more common in modern books, although you can also see it in James Joyce, for instance. The reasons given by modern authors – like “removing the hierarchy between author and reader” – frankly make me raise my eyebrows in doubtful question. (It sounds like something a dinner party guest of Frasier’s would suggest.) It strikes me as a full-of-oneself literary technique that just forces the reader to work harder. What’s wrong with reading quickly and with easy interpretation? I found it quite distracting in this book. I had to re-read certain passages to try to figure out who said what and whether it was a thought or actually spoken out loud.\n\nOf course the Persephone and Demeter myth is dark. It stands to reason that Hades forces himself on Persephone, and this book doesn’t shy away from that. So there are two sexual assaults. One is described as a memory. The other is described in the moment as the character is living it. There’s also a child sexual assault hinted at in flashbacks but not described in any detail. It’s more that the character is remembering how she felt when it happened than what actually happened. Finally, there’s a self-injury described.\n\nI realize that in the myth Persephone is doomed to return to Hades for half the year forever. This can be a tricky thing to address in an updated retelling. But some aspect of what next could have been addressed. I would like to have seen just a hint of how the mother/daughter were going to try to work through this, even if they might not be successful.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting modern retelling of the Persephone and Demeter myth. It admirably writes pharmaceutical companies as the underworld and a CEO billionaire as their god. Potential readers should be aware that this is a dark story, not a romance. It contains sexual assault. Some readers may not enjoy the complete lack of quotation marks. Recommended to readers interested in modern day retellings of mythology.\n\nInstagram:\n\nA contemporary retelling of a Greek myth? Yes, please! Ok, so Fruit of the Dead is not O Brother Where Art Thou. For one thing, it's a retelling of Persephone and Demeter, not The Odyssey. But, on the other hand, that means women and women's voices are centered. Toss in a pharmaceutical billionaire CEO as Hades (aka the god of the underworld), and it almost made up for the lack of bluegrass music. (almost) See my book blog (linked in profile) for my full review.\n\nThank you to the publisher for providing a free copy via NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.\n\n#bookalicious #booksinthewild #avidreader #whatimreading #bookrec #mythologyretelling\n\nGoodReads:\n\nOverall, this is an interesting modern retelling of the Persephone and Demeter myth.
