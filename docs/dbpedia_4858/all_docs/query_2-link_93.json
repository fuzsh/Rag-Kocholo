        "text": "Welcome to the Sega Megadrive Imports Section. All of these Sega Megadrive Games are Imported Japanese Games. To run the Japanese Megadrive games you will need either a modified Sega Megadrive or an import adapter cartridge. I can supply either of these, and they can be found in the Sega Megadrive Hardware or Sega Megadrive Consoles section.\n\nIf you are after PAL Megadrive Games, they can be found in the Sega Megadrive Games section. All games have been cleaned as described in the Care of Second Hand Games section. If you are a collector of import games, please take a look at our other Japanese Video Game Imports.\n\nAs with all of the games I sell, these games are boxed with their original instructions and are in good condition. Fortunately for us, our Japanese gaming friends seem to be much better at looking after their games so the majority of them are absolutely mint!"
