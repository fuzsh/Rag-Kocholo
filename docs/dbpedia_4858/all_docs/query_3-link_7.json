        "text": "Open Season 3 (Russian: Сезон Охоты 3) is a sprite hack of Rolo To The Rescue for the Sega Mega Drive based on the movie of the same name. It was released after the movie's debut in 2010, and it is assumed BMB was behind it due to the font used being identical to their games. The game uses sprites from the Game Boy Advance version of Open Season.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nRolo's mum in the end is replaced with Boog.\n\nThe good ending is unaltered besides it changing the text to say 'The End'.\n\nThe main circus catcher is replaced with a hunter.\n\nThe story according to the main screen before the game states that Boog leaves in loss of happiness and finds a circus and meets a Russian bear and Elliot has to save him.\n\nThe rabbit was replaced with Buddy from the movie.\n\nSimilar to Despicable Me 2, the game loops back to the original game's title screen after the credits, but due to the Title Screen itself being removed, the game goes to the map instead.\n\nGallery[]\n\nVideo[]\n\nGameplay of Open Season 3"
