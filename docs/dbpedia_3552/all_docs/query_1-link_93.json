        "text": "Regular exercise\n\nRegular exercise is essential. Adults aged 19 to 64 should do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week.\n\nWeight-bearing exercise and resistance exercise are particularly important for improving bone density and helping to prevent osteoporosis.\n\nAs well as aerobic exercise, adults aged 19 to 64 should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week by working all the major muscle groups, including the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, arms and shoulders.\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with osteoporosis, it's a good idea to talk to your GP or health specialist before starting a new exercise programme to make sure it's right for you.\n\nFind out more about:\n\nphysical activity guidelines for adults aged 19 to 64\n\nphysical activity guidelines for older adults\n\nhow to keep bones healthy over 65\n\nWeight-bearing exercise\n\nWeight-bearing exercise is exercise where your feet and legs support your weight.\n\nHigh-impact weight-bearing exercise, such as running, skipping, dancing, aerobics, and even jumping up and down on the spot, are all useful ways to strengthen your muscles, ligaments and joints.\n\nWhen exercising, wear footwear that provides your ankles and feet with adequate support, such as trainers or walking boots.\n\nPeople over the age of 60 can also benefit from regular weight-bearing exercise. This can include brisk walking, keep-fit classes or a game of tennis. Swimming and cycling are not weight-bearing exercise, however.\n\nResistance exercise\n\nResistance exercise uses muscle strength, where the action of the tendons pulling on the bones boosts bone strength. Examples include press-ups, weightlifting or using weight equipment at a gym.\n\nIf you've recently joined a gym or have not been for a while, your gym will probably offer you an induction. This involves being shown how to use the equipment and having exercise techniques recommended to you.\n\nAlways ask an instructor for help if you're not sure how to use a piece of gym equipment or how to do a particular exercise."
