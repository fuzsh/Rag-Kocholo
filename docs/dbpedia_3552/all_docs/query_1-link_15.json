        "text": "In the immediate aftermath of the battle, participants and witnesses on both sides gave depositions testifying to the events of April 19, 1775. Eager to get the colonists’ version of the battle to London before Governor Gage’s testimony could arrive at Parliament, the Provincial Congress rushed to print 100 copies of their own narrative and sent them by schooner to England. The American story hit the London newspapers before Gage’s account arrived. It began:\n\nON the nineteenth day of April one thousand, seven hundred and seventy five, a day to be remembered by all Americans of the present generation, and which ought and doubtless will be handed down to ages yet unborn, in which the troops of Britain, unprovoked, shed the blood of sundry of the loyal American subjects of the British King in the field of Lexington. Early in the morning of said day, a detachment of the forces under the command of General Gage, stationed at Boston, attacked a small party of the inhabitants of Lexington and some other towns adjacent….\n\nGovernor Gage submitted his own “Circumstantial Account of an Attack” at Lexington and Concord, which was drawn from several different testimonies and intended to win support for the regulars’ actions:\n\nWhen they arrived at the End of the Village, they observed about 200 armed Men, drawn up on a Green, and when the Troops came within a Hundred Yards of them, they began to file off towards some Stone Walls, on their right Flank : The Light Infantry observing this, ran after them ; the Major instantly called to the Soldiers not to fire, but to surround and disarm them ; some of them who had jumped over a Wall, then fired four or five Shot at the Troops, wounded a Man of the 10th Regiment, and the Major's Horse in two Places, and at the same Time several Shots were fired from a Meeting-House on the left: Upon this, without any Order or Regularity, the Light Infantry began a scattered Fire, and killed several of the Country People; but were silenced as soon as the Authority of their Officers could make them.\n\nSome of those who gave testimony in 1775 later changed their minds about what happened, and the biases of both sides make conclusions difficult. Despite these public relations campaigns to set the story straight, we still don’t know the truth.\n\nWhen the alarm about the regulars’ advance reached families along the Battle Road, many women were left behind while their husbands set off to join their militias. As the British searched homes for contraband, some of them deftly shielded secret stores of arms from the Redcoats, risking personal harm. They slyly misled the troops as to the whereabouts of valuables or quickly buried contraband before the regulars showed up at their doors.\n\nMary Moulton of Concord was particularly heroic. When Pitcairn’s troops set a fire that threatened to spread, Moulton implored the soldiers to extinguish the flames and saved her town from destruction. Moulton later detailed her deed in an application for a pension:\n\nYour petitioner, being left to the mercy of six or seven hundred armed men, and no person near but an old man of eighty-five years, and myself seventy –one years old, and both very infirm…. cultivated so much favor as to talk a little with them. When all on a sudden they had set fire to the great gun carriages just by the house, and while they were in flames your petitioner saw smoke arise out of the Town House higher than the ridge of the house. Then your petitioner did put her life, as it were, in her hand, and ventured to beg of the officers to send some of their men to put out the fire; but they took no notice, only sneered…. your petitioner (not knowing but she might provoke them by her insufficient pleading) yet ventured to put as much strength to her arguments as an unfortunate widow could think of; …At last, by one pail of water after another, they sent and did extinguish the fire.\n\nThere are were doubtless many other colonial women—both white and black, free and enslaved—who took on unheralded roles that day as hundreds of regulars marched into their towns. That we don’t know their names or more about them is largely due to their subservient status in a society that denied them autonomy, education, and recognition."
