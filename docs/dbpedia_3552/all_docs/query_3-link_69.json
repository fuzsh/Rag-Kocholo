        "text": "Cortland Evening Standard, Friday, May 19, 1899.\n\nWAR NEARING AN END.\n\nWar Department Officials of That Belief.\n\nAGUINALDO WILL SURRENDER.\n\nHis Forces So Demoralized by the Persistent Advance of the Americans That They Are Ready to Accept Peace on the Best Terms They Can Obtain.\n\nWASHINGTON, May 19.—War department officials are firmly convinced that the end of the insurrection in the Philippines is at hand and that the representatives of the insurgent cabinet and of Aguinaldo, who are to meet General Otis, will succumb to the inevitable and surrender. Their forces, it is said at the department, evidently are so demoralized by the persistent advance of the Americans that they are ready to accept peace on the best terms they can obtain. Driven northward to the foothills of the mountains, as they have been, their fleeing and scattered forces disintegrated and disheartened, no longer can be made to face our victorious advance.\n\nLess than a week ago, General Luna was reported just north of San Fernando, where General MacArthur's troops are concentrated, and in the neighborhood of Bacolor, with about 9,000 rebels. Now about 2,500 men have withdrawn to Tarlac, over 20 miles north of San Fernando. It is probable that the remainder of this force moved east and joined the main body of the insurgents which abandoned San Isidro and fled northward to the point from which Aguinaldo is now sending his commissioners to sue for peace.\n\nIf this is a ruse to gain time, which none of the officials at the war department believe, it will avail them nothing, as the Americans will utilize the period during the negotiations in reconnoitering the country ahead of them, preparatory to the resumption of operations the minute the negotiations fail.\n\nThe dispatch of two battalions of the Twenty-third infantry to Jolo, the principal town in the Sulu archipelago, is the fourth military expedition detached from the main body of our troops at Manila. The Sulu archipelago is a group of 150 small islands extending in the form of a crescent, like the Alsutian islands south of the Philippines. There are no insurgents, as far as known, in the Sulu group. The population of the islands consists of Aboriginies, Chinese traders, and negroes.\n\nThere is no absolute information at the war department concerning the present strength of the American forces under MacArthur, Lawton and Noble, which have been operating against the insurgents north of Manila. The number of men if each organization were up to its maximum strength would be 16,500, but it is doubtful if their strength totals 11,000 men. MacArthur's troops, except one regiment, are volunteers. All of Kobbe's men are regulars recently arrived. Three of the six regiments under Lawton also are regulars. There is one radical difference between the volunteer and regular organizations. Losses in the former are permanent, while the gaps in the ranks of the regulars are being constantly filled by new recruits. It is estimated that MacArthur now has about 4,500 men for active service; Lawton about 5,000, and Kobbe 1,500.\n\nAnts in Manila.\n\n\"I always imagined,\" says a Kansas boy in Manila, \"that New Jersey was the headquarters for mosquitoes, but Manila has deprived that neck of the woods of all such honors. And ants—gee whiz! They are here by the millions—red ants with jaws like crocodiles, black ants with a stinger sharper than any bee that ever manufactured honey, brown ants, gray ants, ants with wings and ants with nothing but a determination to make life miserable for a soldier. They build nests in your hair, pull your ears, fill your nose, crawl overyour shirt and under your shirt and, in fact, they get in your shoes, torture you in daytime, sleep with you at night and eat with you at dinner time. Why, as I write, a couple are over this very page, as if to show contempt for my opinion of ants. So, you see, soldiering in the Philippines is no snap.\"\n\nBOSTON HARDY KILLED.\n\nStruck by a Syracuse Rapid Transit Trolley Car Yesterday.\n\nBoston Hardy who up to last December [had] lived at 78 Lincoln-ave., Cortland, and then moved to Syracuse, was killed yesterday in Syracuse. Boston was a well-known character in Cortland when he lived here. He will be remembered as the man with the melodious voice who, bell in hand and riding alone in his wagon through the streets, used to give notice of all approaching ball games. The Syracuse Herald says of the accident:\n\nBoston Hardy, a colored laborer employed by the Empire Contracting company on the new pavement in Park-ave., was killed at 9:10 o'clock this morning by trolley car No. 64 of the Rapid Transit company near the corner of Park-ave., and Van Rensselaer-st. The car was in charge of Motorman James Agnold and Conductor Ira. S. Roach and was coming towards the center of the city.\n\nThe statements made by the motorman and Superintendent Anthony S. Webb of the contracting company agree in the main as to how the accident occurred. The contracting company has a large pile of cement in a lot south of the railroad tracks and a board was laid over the rails to be used as a runway on which the men could wheel their wheelbarrows. When the car approached Hardy went to remove the board and was engaged in that work when he was struck by the fender and thrown against the side of the car. His jaw was badly mangled. He died within a few minutes.\n\nThe facts on which the railroad employees and the men working under Mr. Webb disagree relate to the speed of the car and the ringing of the gong. Mr. Webb says that he was standing near Hardy when he was struck. He saw the car approaching at a high rate of speed. The motorman did not ring the bell and did not give an alarm until within 20 feet of Hardy, when he shouted to him to get out of the way.\n\nHardy was 60 years old and he lived at 242 West Jefferson-st. He moved to this city on Dec. 8 of last year. He is survived by a widow. The body is at Snyder's undertaking rooms.\n\nIT RAINED EVERYWHERE.\n\nNo Games Were Played in the State League Yesterday.\n\nRain fell on every State league diamond yesterday and prevented all games. Albany was due to meet its second defeat in Cortland, but the opportunity could not be improved. The game was started and two and one half innings were played when Umpire Carlin called the game owing to the moisture. Neither team had scored. Kellogg was doing Cortland's pitching, and was doing nicely. The twenty-five or more cranks who ventured out were given rain checks.\n\nThe Binghamton Republican of this morning has the following:\n\nSchenectady will go to Cortland and the exchange will give the fans a chance to get a line on the much vaunted Wagonmakers. Brady's men were so easy for the Baconites that the fans were feeling sad yesterday over the loss of what seemed a sure victory with the chance of a rise in the table [standings]. If Cortland doesn't do something with the men from the Electric city, the rooters will have to stop rooting for the Wagonmakers.\n\nMemorial day will be a good day to test the strength of the Binghamton and Cortland teams, as they will meet then for the first time in the morning in Cortland, and at Binghamton in the afternoon. The spirit of rivalry between the two towns is intense, and a big contingent of Cortland rooters will go to Binghamton in the afternoon prepared to help in the victory. The D., L. &. W. R. R. has made a rate of $1.30 for the round trip.\n\nDave Barber seems to be right at home in the outfield, and is as good a man as Ramsey has on his Cortland crowd and yet Barber wasn't strong enough for the Cortland club.—Oswego Times.\n\nCortland plays Schenectady at Athletic field this afternoon and to-morrow afternoon. Games at 3:30.\n\nJohnny Nugent of Utica, who played with Cortland in '97, has signed to play at short with Albany, and joined the team at Binghamton to-day.\n\nGAMES TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW.\n\nSchenectady at Cortland.\n\nRome at Auburn.\n\nAlbany at Binghamton.\n\nUtica at Oswego.\n\nUniversity Center.\n\nAt the meeting of the University Center next Monday night Mr. A. E. Seymour will give an explanation of the Monroe Doctrine, past and present. There will also be a discussion of the question \"Was the Mexican War Justifiable?\" Mr. A. J. Murray will take the affirmative and Prof. W. A. Cornish the negative. Every member is requested to be present.\n\nTEACHERS’ INSTITUTE.\n\nClosing Sessions at Homer—Interesting and Profitable Work Presented.\n\nYesterday the institute had the pleasure of listening to Dr. Redway on \"Some Traditions and Myths,\" and Conductor Sanford in his talk on \"The Teacher's Greatest Problem.\"\n\nIn the first period this morning Miss Rogers gave a talk on nature study, her subject being the \"Caterpillar.\" The work was interesting and instructive. Prof. Sanford addressed the teachers in the advanced section on methods in grammar. In the second Miss Rogers continued her interesting work in nature study in the advanced section, while Prof. Sanford conducted a class exercise in number, which exercise to illustrate method was continued at 11:15 by the conductor.\n\nIn the last period Dr. Redway addressed the advanced section on \"School Meteorology.\"\n\nIn the afternoon the work consisted of nature study by Miss Rogers and the discussion of rivers by Dr. Redway. The institute closed this afternoon.\n\nCornell University State Scholarships.\n\n(Notice Pursuant to Title xii. Chapter 556, Laws of 1894.)\n\nA competitive examination of candidates for the state scholarships in Cornell university, falling to the county of Cortland will be held at the courthouse in the village of Cortland on Saturday, the 3d day of June, 1899, commencing at 9 A. M.\n\nCandidates must be at least 16 years of age and of six months' standing in the common schools or academies of the state during the year immediately preceding this examination, and actual residents of this state.\n\nNo person should enter an examination unless prepared to accept a scholarship should one be awarded.\n\nThe examination will be upon the following subjects, viz: English, history, plane geometry, algebra through quadratic equations, and either Latin, French or German, at the option of the candidate.\n\nThere will be as many candidates appointed from this county as there are assembly districts in this county. Candidates will become entitled to the scholarships in the order of merit.\n\nNATHAN L. MILLER, School Commissioner, First District.\n\nI. W. VAN BUSKIRK, School Commissioner, Second District.\n\nDated at Cortland, N. Y., this 17th day of May, 1899\n\nS. N. Holden.\n\nBEFORE THE POLICE JUSTICE.\n\nAnother Man Whose Light Did Not Shine—Fast Driving Charged.\n\nOfficer Corcoran last night arrested Win Moore, a colored man in the employ of the Cortland Beef company, on the charge of riding a bicycle without a lighted lamp. His case will come up tonight.\n\nEdward Garrity, commonly known as \"Tubby,\" was arrested this morning by Chief Parker on the charge of fast and reckless driving in the streets. The complainant is Village President Holden, who alleges that \"Tubby\" infringed the law on South Main-st., Wednesday evening. Before Police Justice Davis, he pleaded not guilty, and asked that the case be adjourned until to-morrow at 2 o'clock P. M. sothat he might consult his attorney, James Dougherty, who is now engaged in the trial of a case in supreme court.\n\nFrank Stanton, who was with Garrity at the time, was arrested on the same charge. He was arraigned before Justice or the Peace H. J. Harrington instead of the police justice, who is his attorney in another legal matter. Stanton pleaded guilty to the charge, was given a reprimand and discharged.\n\nDon't Kill the Robins.\n\nAny one killing a robin at any season of the year is liable to a fine of from $2 to $20, or imprisonment for twenty days or both. The law makes no exceptions as to the object or purpose for which the robin is killed, but is strictly prohibitive.\n\nTHEY WILL WED.\n\nInvitations Out for the Wedding of Robert Weed and Miss Mary Mahan.\n\nInvitations are out for the wedding of Mr. Robert Stewart Weed of Binghamton and Miss Mary R. Mahan of Cortland which will occur at 7:30 o'clock on the evening of Thursday, June 1, in Grace Episcopal church. The Binghamton Herald says:\n\nMiss Mahan is one of the leading society young women of Cortland. She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Mahan, her father being one of the prominent business men of the village. She has many friends in this city, where she has been a frequent visitor.\n\nMr. Weed is the oldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Weed of Chenango-st., and is prominently identified with his father in the large wholesale and retail clothing business. He has for several years been prominent in Binghamton social circles. They will live in the house at the southwest corner of Riverside Drive and Murray-st., which is being fitted up for them.\n\nBREVITIES.\n\n—A new cement walk is being laid on Main-st. opposite the Messenger House.\n\n—The Sunday-school of the Homer-ave. M. E. church serves ice cream and strawberries to-night from 6 to 8 o'clock.\n\n—All of the walks on the west side of Main-st. south of Tompkins-st. have now been raised to the required grade.\n\n—In Justice Harrington's court the case of E. C. Rindge against T. L. Corwin has been settled and discontinued.\n\n—A private dancing party was held at the park last night, about thirty couples being in attendance. Darby's orchestra furnished the music.\n\n—Mrs. Alvin Van Duser, daughter of L. B. Webb, formerly of South Cortland, died at her home in Elgin, Ill., on May 13 at the age of 20 years.\n\n—The Rev. A. H. Strong, D. D., president of Rochester Theological seminary will preach at the First Baptist church next Sunday both morning and evening.\n\n—New display advertisements to-day are—Stowell, Seven great bargains, page 4; Buck & Lane, Plumbing, etc., page 8; Baker & Angell, Gentlemen's fine shoes, page 8; E. O. Dean, For Saturday only, page 4.\n\n—The public hearing before the board of village trustees on the petitions for paving of Tompkins-st. and Lincoln-ave. will be held at Fireman's hall to-night at 7:30 o'clock;\n\n—The midsummer meet and bicycle carnival of the New York state division of the League of American Wheelmen will be held at Patchogue, L. I., June 29 and 30 and July 1. Special attractions are being arranged to call together a great number of riders and their friends.\n\n—Chancellor James R.

M. E. church will also unite. At 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon he will address the men's meeting at the Y. M. C. A. rooms, at which all men are cordially invited to be present.\n\nCortland Evening Standard, Thursday, May 18, 1899.\n\nGAMBLING IS GOING ON.\n\nNot Interferred With by the New York Police.\n\nSO SAID SEVERAL WITNESSES.\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Hamilton Declares That Mayor Van Wyck Testified to a Falsehood When Before the Mazet Investigation. Other Testimony.\n\nNEW YORK. May 18.—The sessions of the Mazet investigating committee were not noteworthy in any particular, no witness of prominence being called to the stand. James A. Mahoney was one of the witnesses, and he was put through a long series of questions with reference to his alleged connection with pool rooms in this city. Mahoney admitted being a bookmaker, and admitted also that he had conducted a pool room in this city some years ago, but that it had been closed by the police. He declined, however, to answer the question as to whether he still conducted pool rooms here. Very little could be gotten out of him.\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Hamilton, whom Mayor Van Wyck designated a \"blackmailer,\" was on the stand for a short time, and while there declared that what the mayor had said was absolutely false.\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Hamilton…regarding the dismissal of Chief of Police McCullagh, and acknowledged that he had voted against McCullagh, because he had an \"impression\" that Mayor Van Wyck wished him to vote that way [sic]. He said that he remembered the fate of Police Commissioners Phillips and Hamilton, and he believed it the best thing to do to retain his position was to vote against McCullagh, and this he did.\n\nSeveral witnesses were examined who within the past few weeks have been doing detective work for Counsel Moss, and they gave testimony as to the number of pool rooms that are being run in New York city at the present time. They declared that the number was large, that no difficulty was experienced in gambling in these places at will and that at no time was police interference thought of.\n\nGen. Arthur MacArthur.\n\nAFTER THE REBELS.\n\nAmerican Troops Making Further Advance Toward Candaba.\n\nMANILA, May 18.—Major Kobbe's column reached San Luis, eight miles up the Rio Grande, meeting with but slight opposition. One man was wounded during a brush with the rebels.\n\nAt daybreak today the Americans began a further advance toward Candaba, about six miles up the river beyond San Luis.\n\nThe insurgents along General MacArthur's front evacuated their positions during the night time, presumably moving further up the railroad.\n\nThe Twenty-third Infantry has sailed on the transport Leon XIII for Jolo island to relieve the Spanish garrison there.\n\nPAGE TWO—EDITORIALS.\n\nCivil Service Examinations.\n\nThe new law governing appointments to the state civil service will come into full effect to-morrow. A single merit examination will thenceforth take the place of the merit and fitness examinations that have been held under the Black law.\n\nGovernor Roosevelt, to whose earnest efforts was due largely the restoration of the single examination, means that to the extent of his power and influence the law shall operate in behalf of reform as intended. It will be administered by friends of reform, which under some administrations has not been the case.\n\nThat it is easy to defeat the purposes of civil service reform statutes and make the subject a jest, is shown by a glance at questions noted by the Utica Herald as actually submitted to candidates in past examinations. For instance, to candidates for appointment to the position of deputy factory inspector these questions were submitted: \"Multiply 5.0207 by 807 and from the product subtract 1/5 of 549.85;\" \"Name four of the largest rivers which take their rise in this state;\" \"Name the five important powers of congress;\" \"Explain, in a general way, the grounds on which the United States supreme court declared the income tax unconstitutional.\"\n\nInability to multiply decimals, to define points of constitutional law or the powers of congress, would not be incompatible with the possession of thorough equipment for factory inspecting. Such questions submitted to candidates for such duties denote unfitness on the part of the examiners—either from hostility to, or a hopeless misconception of, the intent and purpose of the law.\n\nGovernor Roosevelt means that examinations under the new law shall be fair to the applicants for place and to the people, in whose behalf the civil service reform statue was enacted. To that end he has expressed his views on the preparation of questions defining, as it seems to us, very accurately the principle that should govern in all cases. He says: \"Every question asked in the civil service examination should be stricken out, in my opinion, unless we can say either that a knowledge of it is absolutely necessary to enable the candidate to do the work that he aspires to do, or unless it can be said that ignorance of it is conclusive of a deficient mental attainment.\"\n\nCivil service examinations conducted on this basis will be fair to applicants and to the reform principle. The candidate for factory inspector will be questioned regarding things pertaining to the duties he is to perform; a candidate for lock tender on the canals need not be an expert in factory matters, nor in law, nor in mathematics. An examination for place in the civil service should aim to determine the ability of the applicant to fill the place sought. There is confidence that under the present administration that end honestly will be sought.\n\nEmilio Aguinaldo.\n\nASKING FOR PEACE.\n\nAguinaldo Sending Messengers to Gen. Otis to End War.\n\nWASHINGTON, May 18.—General Otis cables the war department that representatives of Aguinaldo are seeking terms of peace and that the forces of the insurgents are scattering into the mountains.\n\nFollowing is General Otis' cable:\n\nMANILA, May 18.\n\nAdjutant General, Washington:\n\nRepresentatives, insurgent cabinet and Aguinaldo in mountains twelve miles north San Isidro which abandoned 15th instant, will send in commission to-morrow to seek terms of peace. Majority of force confronting McArthur at San Fernado has retired to Tarlac, tearing up two miles railway; this force has decreased to about twenty-five hundred. Scouting parties and detachments moving to-day in various directions. Kobbe with column at Candava on Rio Grande. Great majority of inhabitants of provinces over which troops have moved anxious for peace, supported by members of insurgent cabinet. Aspect of affairs at present favorable. (Signed) OTIS.\"\n\nDewey to Start for Home.\n\nNEW YORK, May 18.—A dispatch from Hong Kong says that Admiral Dewey has notified Consul Wildman that he will arrive at Hong Kong on May 25.\n\nA. J. Barber.\n\nEARLY MORNING FIRE.\n\nWoodshop andCupola Room of Hitchcock Foundry Destroyed.\n\nThe third fire in rapid succession occurred in Cortland at 2 o'clock this morning, when the woodworking shop and cupola room of the old Hitchcock foundry on Port Watson-st. were practically destroyed.\n\nJust before 2 o'clock this morning Officers Smith and Corcoran were at the D., L. & W. station, when they heard a sound as of an explosion. They thought that a safe had been blown up in the vicinity and made a tour of investigation, but found nothing out of order. Returning to the depot, a brakeman of a freight train called their attention to a bright light up toward the Messenger House. They were sure it was a fire, and one of them turned in an alarm from box 332 at the station. At about this time, J. R. Schermerhorn discovered the blaze and opening a front door shouted, \"fire.\" Officers Nix and Gooding were at the police station, and they started at once for the scene with Orris hose cart. It was but a short time before the entire department was at the fire, and pouring four streams of water upon the flames which were in the one story woodshop and cupola room at the rear of the old Hitchcock foundry on Port Watson-st. now owned by Keator, Wells & Co.\n\nIt was raining hard at the time, and this fact somewhat prevented the spread of the fire from sparks, but the place is a regular fire trap, a number of old wooden buildings being in very close proximity. But the skillful work done by the department under Chief Barber's direction saved a large amount of valuable property. Hose was laid both from Main-st. and Port Watson-st., and the fire was under control in less than twenty minutes.\n\nIn the woodshop was a quantity of woodworking machinery which is pretty nearly a total loss. In the cupola room, or the room where the molten iron is formed, the greatest loss is a quantity of coke. Both parts were gutted and are entirely useless.\n\nThe origin of the fire is thought to have been from sparks in the cupola room, which flew in great numbers when a \"heat\" was taken off yesterday afternoon. Some of these sparks must have caught in the woodwork somewhere, and slowly smouldered until the fire broke out.\n\nThe owners of the building had it well insured, the total amount being $8,800, placed as follows: with F. A. Woodworth, $1,250 in the Eagle company, and $1,250 in the Northwestern; with G. J. Maycumber, $2,100 in the Imperial, $2,100 in the Globe, and $2,100 in the Phoenix company. The loss is hard to estimate.\n\nThe buildings burned both adjoined the machine shop which is directly south of them, there being an alleyway between them about 20 feet wide. The fire was confined entirely to the two sections burned, the machine shop being uninjured.\n\nALMOST A FIRE.\n\nSmall Blaze in a Madison-st. Dwelling Last Night.\n\nAnother serious fire was averted last evening by prompt action at the home of Mr. and Mrs. William S. Barker on Madison-st. Mrs. Barker had been out calling at a neighbor's and returned at about 9 o'clock. With a gas lighter in her hand she was passing from one room into another to light the gas, when the flame from the lighter caught in the portieres between the rooms and set them on fire. They blazed up furiously. Messrs. Myron, Muncy and Harry W. Chaplin were passing at the time. Mr. Chaplin went inside to assist Mrs. Barker extinguish the fire, and Mr. Muncy hastened to the corner of Main and Grant-sts. to turn in an alarm of fire. He did not thoroughly understand how to turn in the alarm, and while trying to do so, word came to him that the fire was out. But little damage was done.\n\nFORMERLY OF HOMER.\n\nMr. A. J. Daniels Recalling Old Days and Friendships.\n\nRev. and Mrs. Geo. H. Brigham had yesterday a most enjoyable, though all too short, visit from a very dear old friend, Mr. A. J. Daniels of Grand Rapids, Mich. Forty years ago Mr. Daniels was professor of mathematics in the then notable academy of Homer, and it was the privilege of Mr. Brigham to baptize him and his estimable wife into the fellowship of the Baptist church of Homer.\n\nFrom Homer Prof. Daniels went to Grand Rapids, upon double the salary he had received in Homer, and which was increased from year to year until he was elected superintendent of the city schools, which position he successfully filled for sixteen years, when he retired from school work and engaged in the lumber business, in which with energy and tact he achieved gratifying success. Two years ago he transferred the business into the hands of his son and he and his wife are now enjoying the fruits of many well spent years of active, useful labor, having just returned from a thirteen months' tour of Europe, having visited, accompanied by their only daughter, a graduate of Vassar college, nearly all of the principal states, or kingdoms of Europe, their capitals, great seats of learning, and many of the great natural curiosities and wonders of those countries.\n\nGlad to be in \"native land\" again. Mrs. Daniels and daughter had gone on to their home, while he stopped off for a few days, once more to visit old friends in Vesper, Homer and Cortland.\n\nTEACHERS' INSTITUTE.\n\nCortland Normal Teachers Prove Very Helpful to All.\n\nThe Wednesday afternoon session was occupied by Dr. Cheney in an earnest talk on the worth of the teacher. Dr. Cheney's appeal to the teachers was very helpful as was also his morning talk. The second period was occupied by Conductor Sanford in a talk on \"Habit in Education.\"\n\nTHURSDAY MORNING.\n\nMiss Gale gave two more of her practical talks this morning. The work was adapted to inexperienced teachers. This institute has been fortunate in having Miss Gale whose talks have been among the best elements of the week, being full, as they are, of plain practical common sense and help for all. If our institutes consisted of more such delightful talks the work of the week would be of much more help than many of them are. A large part of the practical help received from the week is due to Miss Gale's talks.\n\nDr. Redway addressed the teachers in three periods, one on maps and map drawing, the second on pictures and models, and third on factors in climate. The institute has been fortunate in having Dr. Redway to address them in geography, on which he is so high an authority. His talks have been of certain help to the teachers.\n\nProf. Booth gave experiments in physiology. The talk was splendid, inasmuch as it was practical, and the experiments and apparatus simple, but full of interest for both teacher and pupil. Our institutes would be of far more help if we could have more of such work from Prof. Booth. Prof. Booth has kindly consented to give another talk at 8:15 Friday morning. It is unfortunate that the experiments of this morning could not have been given before the entire institute.\n\nThe teachers registered are as follows, the numbers following the name indicating the number of terms taught:\n\nBlodgett Mills—Allen B.

Since her graduation she has taken postgraduate work at the Buffalo Normal school and has taught at Madison and Cincinnatus academies. Mr. Smith is a graduate of [Ellsworth] seminary, Iowa, and a promising young business man of Homer, having recently purchased the Sherman jewelry store in that place.\n\nAfter the ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Smith left by the D., L. & W. R. R. for a short wedding tour, and after their return they are to make their home in Homer. Beautiful presents including a liberal check from the father of the bride attest the high esteem in which Mr. and Mrs. Smith are held. A very large circle of friends will extend best wishes and congratulations.\n\nBrought to Cortland for Burial.\n\nThe infant daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. L.
