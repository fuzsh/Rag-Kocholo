        "text": "With the possibility of a major conflict brewing with the United States since the killing of Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani, the capabilities of the Iranian military are being sharply scrutinized.\n\nSo just how strong are the Islamic republic's armed forces?\n\nThe answer to that question hinges largely on what strategic goals Iran pursues.\n\nTehran’s main goal is to project its influence and protect its interests throughout the Middle East or to at least prevent adversaries, like Saudi Arabia, from gaining the upper hand.\n\nTo accomplish that, Tehran has done everything possible to deter and harass the enormous contingents of U.S. forces deployed in 10 countries throughout the region with the ultimate objective being to push them out.\n\nIn pursuing that goal, Iran will likely avoid a full-blown war because its military is no match for the American armed forces and Washington's allies stationed in the Middle East, experts say.\n\nNo Nukes, Lots Of Proxies\n\nThe Iranians have a well-publicized and highly controversial nuclear program, but do not currently have the capability to make a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"They have a ballistic-missile program but no long-range missiles that can reach the United States,\" The Atlantic noted.\n\nIt added that Tehran lacks any major friends in the region: \"Iran has decent relations with Russia and China but no stalwart, great-power allies.\"\n\nAs arguably one of the world’s most-isolated countries, Iran has mainly embarked on a strategy of proxy wars or conducting asymmetrical strikes aimed at exploiting the vulnerabilities of American and U.S.-led forces.\n\nThe Iranian military -- which is the eighth largest in the world based on active personnel -- is suited to pursue a strategy of asymmetrical warfare.\n\nModest Military Budget\n\nIran's defense budget in 2018 was more than $13 billion, ranking it 18th in the world in terms of military expenditures, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nBut Tehran lagged far behind regional foes such as Saudi Arabia, which spent some $70 billion, and Israel, at $18.5 billion (the United States is without rival at more than $700 billion).\n\nIn addition, Iranian military expenditures declined by 9.5 percent in 2018 compared to the previous year due to massive economic problems caused by U.S. sanctions, a strategy that Washington refers to as \"maximum pressure.\"\n\nBut Iran’s military establishment, especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), does not depend merely on the state budget for its funding, according to the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD).\n\n\"The military establishment controls [one-fifth] of the market value of companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange and owns thousands of other companies, all of which generate revenue for the armed forces,\" the FDD reported. \"Additionally, the IRGC controls a significant portion of Iran’s underground economy.\"\n\nBiggest In The Middle East\n\nIn terms of overall military strength, the Iranian armed forces rank 14th in the world out of 137 countries that are ranked in 2019 by Global Firepower and Business Insider.\n\nWith some 523,000 active-duty forces and another 350,000 reserves, Iran has the largest standing military in the Middle East.\n\nThe active forces are comprised of 350,000 in the regular army and at least 150,000 in the IRGC, which has the most powerful forces in the Iranian military.\n\nIn a sign of its importance, IRGC Commander in Chief Hossein Salami reports directly to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nAn Army Within An Army\n\nThe IRGC itself is made up of five subgroups.\n\nOne of those groups, the Quds Force, was led for decades by Soleimani until his assassination in a U.S. drone strike on January 3 -- the event that put Iran and the United States in their current quandary.\n\nThe Quds Force is mostly tasked with overseas operations, predominantly in the Middle East.\n\nEstimates of its exact number of forces vary.\n\nBut Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told NBC News that it is a “divisional strength military formation” of around 17,000 to 21,000 members.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the extraterritorial use of the Quds Force provides for the enlistment of various Shi'ite militias that number, according to The Guardian, up to 200,000 fighters. The militias operate in at least five countries in the region.\n\nThe English daily adds that these pro-Iranian proxy armies that engage \"in a 'grey zone' of conflict that maintains hostilities below the threshold of state-on-state warfare.\"\n\nAnother group within the IRCG structure is the Basij militia, a paramilitary force with 90,000 members mobilized to enforce order, which includes quelling dissent within the country, such as the nationwide anti-government protests in November that ended with hundreds of demonstrators killed and thousands injured.\n\nLike many related institutions in Iran, the Basij was first formed as a volunteer force during the Iran-Iraq War. But it “has since become an entrenched, and feared, part of the state,” The Washington Post reported.\n\nAlso operating under the IRCG umbrella are the 20,000 service personnel in the naval forces, which rely first and foremost on waves of armed patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nWith more than 20 percent of the world's oil trade moving through the strait, it is the world's most-important oil-trade route and the scene of several confrontations between Iranian vessels and foreign-flagged tankers in 2019.\n\nAlthough smaller in number, the IRCG is more powerful than the regular army because of the bifurcated nature of the Iranian state. For that reason, relations between the government and the IRCG have always been strained.\n\nTanking Up\n\nIran has some 1,634 tanks, ranking 18th out of 137 countries surveyed. That number is buttressed by about 2,345 armored combat vehicles and 1,900 rocket launchers.\n\nThe large tank force is, however, mostly made up of older models and completely outdated tanks. Only the new model Karrar, which was supposed to be delivered to the Iranian military in 2018, can compare with some of the better tanks in the world. Although the Karrar looks much like the well-known Russian T-90, Iran has rejected suggestions there was any collaboration with Russia in its production.\n\nIn The Navy\n\nThe Iranian Navy is, comparatively, a modest force that has neither an aircraft carrier nor a destroyer.\n\nTehran's navy does possess six frigates, three corvettes, 34 submarines, and 88 patrol vessels. The submarine's arsenal contains the Russian-made \"kilo\" class, which are called \"black holes\" because they are inaudible.\n\nThe 'Fast Flyers'\n\nWith some 509 aircrafts, the Iranian Air Force lags far behind -- both in terms of quantity and quality -- regional adversaries Saudi Arabia and Israel, which can boast of having 848 and 595 state-of-the-art airplanes, respectively, in their fleets, The National Interest reported.\n\nThat doesn't include a healthy stable of U.S. planes throughout the region.\n\nMuch of Iran's air force dates from the shah era or is left over from dictator Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi Air Force, which moved many of its planes to Iran during the 1991 Persian Gulf War to avoid their destruction by U.S.-led forces.\n\nAmerican-made F-4, F-5, and F-14 fighters built in the 1970s remain the pillar of the Iranian Air Force, which is nicknamed \"Tizparvazan\" (the Fast Flyers).\n\nFollowing the 2015 nuclear deal -- which lifted tough international sanctions against Iran and boosted its economy -- the country had a brief opportunity to upgrade its air force.\n\nFrance's Mirage 2000 was an option, but Tehran ultimately decided against it because it was more familiar with its American- and Russian-made planes.\n\nIran also had a chance to buy as many as 30 sophisticated Su-30 fighters from Russia, but opted not to, The National Interest reported.\n\n“This is probably because the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps paramilitary has never been comfortable with the regular Iranian military becoming too powerful,” the U.S. magazine concluded.\n\nMissile Reliance\n\nCrippled by the U.S.-imposed sanctions that have reduced its oil exports to a trickle, Iran's military equipment imports have dropped significantly in recent years.\n\nIran's arms imports decreased drastically in 2018 and the country's total imports for its military from 2009 to 2018 were just 3.5 percent of Saudi Arabia's total imports during the same period.\n\nTehran has had to therefore increasingly depend on the development of domestic technologies for its military needs, including cheaper hardware imports that come mainly from Russia and China.\n\nIran also relies on the development of missiles in order to overcome the disadvantage of having less military equipment that is often of a lower quality than its regional foes and, certainly, the United States and other Western countries.\n\nIran is, however, recognized as having the most developed short- and medium-range missile system in the region.\n\nAmong other missiles, it has 300-kilometer range Shahab 1 missiles, moving Washington to install a Patriot antiaircraft system in some neighboring countries to counter possible missile threats from Iran.\n\nTehran has also worked on the development of intercontinental missiles, although those programs were suspended after Iran agreed to the historic nuclear agreement with six world powers in 2015 that put curbs on its nuclear program.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the United States from the treaty in 2018, Iran began to gradually suspend its adherence to the provisions of the treaty and ultimately announced after Soleimani's killing that it was abandoning all limits in the agreement.\n\nThat development leaves open the possibility of Tehran restoring efforts to develop intercontinental missiles.\n\nAccording to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a Shahab 3 missile with a range of up to 2,000 kilometers could hit Israel and is widely considered to be Tehran’s deterrent of last resort.\n\nThe International Institute for Strategic Studies also reports that Iran has 32 batteries of Russia's S-300 air-defense system.\n\nNot To Forget: Cyberwarfare And Drones\n\nFinally, Iran also has a full complement of drones that it has used in operations in both Iraq and against Israel. It is also believed that an Iranian drone was used in September to attack Saudi oil facilities.\n\nThe IRGC also boasts a cyberattack unit that is known to have been responsible for several attacks abroad.\n\nAfter the assassination of Soleimani, many figured Iran could respond with a massive cyberattack against a U.S. entity, a fear that continues, according to The New York Times.\n\nThree-Pronged Strategy?\n\nMost analysts have predicted that Iran would not venture into an open conflict with the United States over Soleimani's killing, but would instead use its assets to conduct asymmetrical operations to try and harm U.S. forces or American interests in the Middle East.\n\nDespite having already responded with a missile attack against the two U.S. military bases in Iraq, the threat of lower-level attacks using other strategies remains.\n\nIn such a potential confrontation, Tehran would count on \"three legs,\" as Deutsche Welle pointed out.\n\nOne leg is \"defense before the border\" -- namely the operation of Quds Force units outside Iran to attack U.S. forces.\n\nThe other legs of such a strategy are the use of long-range missiles to strike further away U.S. targets or an attempt to shut down the Strait of Hormuz and send global energy markets into a death spiral.\n\nIn the event of a conflict involving action in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran can count on the world's fourth-largest oil reserves of more than 150 billion barrels to sustain it during such a blockage.\n\nTehran's concern of a land invasion of its territory is probably quite low, as according to some Western estimates quoted by The Guardian, such an incursion would require “an improbable 1.6 million troops” in order to prevent an Iraq-style counterinsurgency from emerging against U.S. forces.\n\nWith U.S. President Donald Trump seemingly de-escalating after Iran's January 8 missile attack caused no American casualties, few people envision Washington entertaining a scenario involving ground troops.\n\nU.S. Troops In The Region\n\nThere are estimated to be more than 50,000 U.S. troops deployed in the Middle East, according to numerous sources. Here is a rough breakdown:\n\n'Twilight War'\n\nAnother possible option for Iran is the status quo.\n\nHistorian David Crist has dubbed the four decades of the shadow battle that the United States and Iran have been locked in since the 1979 Islamic Revolution to be a ''twilight war.\"\n\nAs The Atlantic noted, Iran has tended to follow a certain blueprint during this time: “compensate for its inferior military capabilities relative to the United States by waging wide-ranging proxy warfare that stops short of direct conflict, allows it to maintain plausible deniability, and is carefully calibrated to advance Iranian interests at a low cost and with minimal risk.\"\n\nSoleimani's assassination by U.S. forces and the Iranian missile response hitting American bases in Iraq is the first open confrontation between the two countries since Iranian protesters invaded the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.\n\nAlthough the current situation has de-escalated for the moment, it is still fraught with the risk of becoming more serious and disrupting the \"twilight war\" of strained but controlled relations that have existed between the two countries for so long.\n\nYahya Sinwar, the alleged architect of the deadly October 7 attack on Israel and surprise appointment as the new leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated terror group Hamas, is known to have close ties to Iran.\n\nHis appointment on August 6 as the head of the Palestinian group's political bureau followed the assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran on July 31, an act that Iran and Hamas blame on Israel.\n\nFollowing the death of Haniyeh, who had strong relations with Iranian officials, the most prominent names to be considered as his successor were Khaled Meshaal, a former politburo chief of Hamas, and Khalil al-Hayya, a prominent figure within the bureau with close ties to Haniyeh.\n\nThe appointment of Sinwar, who has been the Hamas chief in Gaza since 2017, came as a big surprise because many did not take into account the Iran factor, analysts say.\n\n\"None of us experts on Palestinian affairs -- especially here in Israel -- thought about Sinwar as the person who would replace Haniyeh,\" said Yohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies who specializes in Israeli-Palestinian relations.\n\n\"One [major] reason why Sinwar is the [new] leader is Iran,\" he added.\n\nSinwar was appointed after two days of deliberations in Qatar by the Shura Council -- a consultative body that elects the group's politburo and has members in Gaza, the West Bank, Israeli prisons, and the Palestinian diaspora.\n\nTzoreff said Meshaal's criticism during the 2011 Arab Spring of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- a close ally of Tehran -- made him a deeply unpopular figure among Iran's top brass.\n\nTzoreff argued that Mashaal's return to power could have jeopardized the Palestinian group's relations with the Islamic republic and \"[the Iranians] may have stopped giving Hamas everything it needs [to fight Israeli forces].\"\n\nBut Sinwar is reportedly stuck in Gaza, where he has been in hiding since the start of the war with Israel in October 2023. The constraints on his movement and restricted ability to communicate with the world mean Sinwar is very limited in what he can do.\n\n\"I don’t expect him or Hamas to become closer to Iran. At this point, the relationship will likely stay the same,\" said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East and North Africa Program director at the Belgium-based International Crisis Group.\n\nMolded By Israeli Prisons\n\nAlso known by his supporters as Abu Ibrahim, the 61-year-old Sinwar was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza. His parents, like Haniyeh's, fled the coastal town of Ashkelon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War that resulted in the establishment of the state of Israel -- or what Palestinians call the \"nakba\" (catastrophe).\n\nSinwar joined Hamas shortly after it was formed in 1987 and set up its feared internal security organization, Al-Majd, whose main purpose was to find Israeli spies within the group. He gained a reputation for violence and was nicknamed the \"Butcher of Khan Younis.\"\n\nSinwar was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to multiple life terms for a variety of offenses -- including the killing of two Israeli soldiers -- and spent more than two decades in prison.\n\n\"He is a guy who was hardened in Israeli prisons, like many longtime Palestinian ex-prisoners,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nHe said Sinwar learned Hebrew while in prison and, crucially, this helped him to learn how Israeli leaders think.\n\n\"Sinwar's really tough. He is ruthless. He is very much a leader in the mold of any Israeli leader,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nWhile in prison, Sinwar organized strikes to improve working conditions and emerged as a leader among incarcerated Palestinians.\n\nHis experience in prison \"prepared him very well for the leadership of Hamas\" and in planning the October 7 attack, Hiltermann said.\n\nNearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed when Hamas militants raided communities in south Israel in October and took hostages back to Gaza. The attack prompted Israel to launch a major offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which Palestinian sources say has killed more than 40,000 people.\n\nSinwar was released from prison in 2011 as part of an exchange that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners freed in return for one Israeli soldier held by Hamas. Soon after his release, Sinwar accompanied Haniyeh on a trip to Tehran where he met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe same day Sinwar was announced as Haniyeh's successor on August 6, Khamenei's account on X posted a short video of that visit showing Sinwar meeting with the Iranian leader in February 2012.\n\nHamas's Message\n\nTraditionally, Hamas's political bureau chief is based abroad so he can travel and maintain contact with regional allies, such as Iran and the Lebanese Islamic militant group Hizballah.\n\nBut Sinwar, who U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken once joked is \"buried 10 stories underground\" in Gaza, is unable to leave the enclave because of the war.\n\nTzoreff said that, by appointing a Gaza-based leader, Hamas was \"sending a very strong message\" to both Israel and Arab states that \"the resistance of Hamas has not collapsed.\"\n\n\"The main message is that nobody can push them out of the area,\" he added.\n\nSinwar himself may not be keen on leaving Gaza, because his legitimacy is based on his being in the enclave.\n\n\"If Sinwar were to leave Gaza, Palestinians would say he is abandoning them, like a captain leaving the ship,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nSinwar has been in Israel's sights since the beginning of the war, with army spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari describing him as a \"dead man\" following the October attack.\n\nKilling Sinwar remains a priority for the Israeli army.\n\nChief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi vowed on August 7 that his troops would target Sinwar and force Hamas to \"replace the head of the political bureau again.\"\n\nRussia and Iran have both seen their international standing diminish in recent years. And as each seeks a way to boost their military and diplomatic influence, Africa looks like a land of opportunity.\n\nThere are no signs that Moscow and Tehran, whose bilateral ties have become closer as they each try to counter punitive international sanctions, are working in lockstep in Africa.\n\nBut their aims in the continent often align, and experts say the two are each attempting to capitalize on similar situations, including political instability, war, and apathy toward the influence of Western powers.\n\n\"Both Iran and Russia, what they see in Africa is an opportunity to break their diplomatic isolation,\" said Cameron Hudson, fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"They have been isolated by the West, financially, politically -- essentially branded as pariah states. And so, in Africa, they see 54 opportunities to break that status.\"\n\nRussia and Iran have stepped up their engagement with African states, some of which are wary of the West and open to finding alternative trade and investment partners. Tehran and Moscow are notably active in places of conflict, such as West Africa and the Sahel, where juntas have made clear that Western forces are not welcome.\n\nHudson said Moscow's and Tehran’s involvement in Africa also has the \"ancillary benefit of thumbing their nose\" at the Western states behind the crippling international sanctions imposed on them.\n\nThe sanctions -- imposed over Russia's war in Ukraine and Iran's controversial nuclear program, among other things -- have effectively cut both Russia and Iran off from the global financial system and harmed their lucrative trade in arms and oil.\n\nNew Avenues\n\nBy opening new avenues of trade and influence in Africa, Moscow and Tehran can show that the attempts to isolate and punish them \"is only marginally successful, and that they can build coalitions of states who support their interests,\" Hudson said.\n\nThe two countries see Africa as \"a battleground where they can supplant the West and better position themselves economically, politically, and even militarily for prolonged tension with the West,\" said Liam Karr, an analyst with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.\n\nKarr noted that Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger -- former French colonies in the central Sahel where anti-Western military juntas have taken power -- \"have increased cooperation with Iran and Russia as they distanced themselves from France.\"\n\nThe situation has already led to the expulsion of French troops from Niger and Mali. U.S. forces battling Islamist insurgents in the region have withdrawn from Niger's capital, Niamey, and will completely leave the country by September.\n\nThe rapidly changing landscape has led to some uncomfortable situations, such as when Russian troops backing Niger's junta were deployed in May to an air base housing U.S. soldiers.\n\nBoth Iran and Russia \"use military engagement to 'get their foot in the door' with unstable or other isolated countries to pursue greater economic and political cooperation,\" Karr explained. Such military engagement, he added, also \"allows them to use limited resources to threaten critical waterways, such as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.\"\n\n'Opportunity In Chaos'\n\nMoscow's influence is marked by high-level political engagement, business dealings including arms sales, and the ubiquitous presence of pro-Kremlin mercenaries in conflict areas.\n\n\"Russia finds opportunity in chaos. And so, when there is political instability in a country, when there is a kind of organic rejection of the West, which we have seen in a lot of states in Africa that view the West as a kind of neocolonial actor, then that creates openings and opportunities for Russia to come in with its narrative,\" Hudson said.\n\nRussia's military footprint is also the most hazardous, as evidenced by the deaths of scores of Russian Wagner mercenaries in fighting against Tuareg separatists linked to the Al-Qaeda terrorist network in Mali last month.\n\nIran is playing catch-up to its Russian ally, working to expand its influence on the continent through trade ties, arms sales, and the use of proxies and militant partners as part of its \"axis of resistance\" against Israel and the West in general.\n\nIn West Africa, Iran has reached out to the trio of juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. In Nigeria, Tehran has established a proxy group called the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, which functions like other proxies and partners.\n\nTehran has also used proxies to make its presence felt across the Sahel to the Horn of Africa, allowing it to put more pressure on regional adversaries, primarily Israel.\n\n'Aligned Interests'\n\nIran's and Russia's interest in Africa sometimes overlaps, as is the case in Niger and in Sudan, where both are playing a role in the yearlong civil war between the Sudanese military and rebel forces.\n\n\"Sudan is a clear area where they both have military interests. Iran and Russia have both offered military support to the Sudanese Armed Forces hoping to secure a military base on Sudan’s Red Sea coast that would enable them to improve their military posture in the area vis-à-vis the West,\" Karr said. \"Iran has offered drones, whereas Russia has offered 'unrestricted qualitative military aid.'\"\n\nJuntas that have taken power in Mali and Niger, meanwhile, are looking to Moscow and Tehran to fortify their positions.\n\n\"They certainly lack legitimacy in the West and among international institutions, and so building relations to Iran or to Russia helps them build legitimacy, because all of a sudden they look like state actors,\" Hudson said. \"They look like they're doing the trade and diplomacy that a legitimate government would do.\"\n\nBoth Karr and Hudson say there are no clear signs that Russia and Iran are coordinating their strategies in Africa.\n\nKarr said that \"similar aims and methods mean that most of their efforts mutually reinforce each other,\" while Hudson noted \"a set of aligned interests, but not interests that are being explicitly coordinated.\"\n\nAutocracies around the world have become increasingly mutually reinforcing in their competition with democratic societies, Pulitzer Prize winning U.S. journalist and historian Anne Applebaum said in an interview with Current Time.\n\n\"Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, Azerbaijan, and Angola don't have a common ideology,\" Applebaum said. \"But they have places where they can cooperate and common interests. And some of their interests are financial.\"\n\n\"The Chinese invest in autocratic regimes all over the world and help prop them up,\" she added. \"The Russians do the same…. They offer mercenaries to dictators in Africa who are in trouble. They look for areas where they have something in common and where they can help one another.\"\n\n\"They don't need a common ideology to do that,\" Applebaum said.\n\nIn her new book, Autocracy, Inc.: The Dictators Who Want To Rule The World, Applebaum writes that such governments are undergirded by \"sophisticated networks composed of kleptocratic financial structures, surveillance technologies, and professional propagandists, all of which cooperate across multiple regimes,\" the book argues, according to the author's website.\n\nApplebaum told Current Time this is a fundamental difference from the geopolitical situation in the 20th century, \"when there was a thing called the communist bloc and they all used the same language…and they even had very similar political and social systems.\"\n\nDespite the lack of a centralizing ideology, the world's autocracies share a \"common enemy,\" she noted.\n\n\"The common enemy is…anybody who lives in the democratic world and anybody who uses the language of democracy…of human rights, transparency, accountability, the rule of law, justice,\" Applebaum said. \"That language is threatening to them and, of course, it is most threatening to them when it comes from their own opposition movements and their own internal critics and…dissidents.\"\n\nIn addition, freed from ideology, modern authoritarian regimes have much greater scope to influence political and social developments in open societies.\n\n\"Authoritarian propaganda can now reach people in the United States in a way that communist propaganda could not,\" Applebaum said. \"The money that autocratic states have gives them a kind of power that, again, the Soviet Union never had, whether it's to invest as investors, whether it's to buy influence among politicians or…the business community, whether its even in the form of dark money to fund political campaigns.\"\n\n\"All those things give them more tools to influence the internal debates and political conversations of democracies, as well as their economies, than they used to have,\" she added.\n\nMedia outlets like the Kremlin's RT network, Applebaum added, \"turned out to be good at…crafting an authoritarian narrative that described autocracies as safe and secure and stable, and democracies as divided, chaotic, and degenerate.\"\n\n\"And some version of that, in millions of forms, is now available on the Internet,\" she said. \"And that…chimed with a part of the American political spectrum that is…feeling disgruntled, that doesn't like social change, demographic change, economic change, and political change over the last couple of decades and is seeking to reverse it.\"\n\nAuthoritarian regimes did not cause the \"backlash against democracy\" in the United States and other democratic countries, \"but they helped give it language,\" she said. \"They make existing divisions deeper.\"\n\nNonetheless, these regimes understand that democratic values and language remain in demand. In Venezuela, for instance, people have taken to the streets to call for transparency, justice, and the rule of law despite the country's \"really ugly dictatorship.\"\n\n\"People want to live in a society where there's rule of law, where judges are real judges,\" Applebaum told Current Time, a Russian-language TV and digital network run by RFE/RL. \"I think you can see this in a lot of places. It's about the innate appeal of the idea of living in a more fair society where citizens have some influence.\"\n\n\"I think this one of the reasons why the autocratic world has, if you will, rearmed itself or has girded itself against the democratic world in a much more dramatic way than it did two decades ago,\" Applebaum said.\n\nWritten by RFE/RL's Robert Coalson based on reporting by Current Time correspondent Ksenia Sokolyanskaya.\n\nThe Middle East faces its biggest crisis in years as it braces for a potential full-blown war between Iran and Israel that could drag in the entire region.\n\nIsrael's suspected killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31 has pushed the region to the brink.\n\nA major military response by Iran against Israel, which Tehran has promised, could spark an all-out war that would pit Iran and its regional proxies against Israel and the United States, experts say.\n\n\"I think this is the first time we're really heading toward a potential full-scale regional confrontation,\" said Raz Zimmt, a senior researcher at the Israeli-based Institute for National Security Studies.\n\n'Only A Matter Of Time'\n\nThe region has been bracing for an Iranian response since the assassination of Haniyeh, who was killed in an affluent neighborhood of Tehran hours after attending the inauguration of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIran has directly blamed Israel, which has not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed, and reportedly approved, a military response.\n\nHaniyeh's killing came just hours after Israel killed a top commander of Hizballah, the Iran-backed Lebanese extremist group, in Beirut. A member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps was also killed in the July 30 Israeli air strike.\n\nIn April, Iran and Israel appeared to be on the verge of war after Tehran launched an unprecedented direct air attack against its archfoe.\n\nDays later, suspected Israeli strikes hit a military base outside Iran's central city of Isfahan.\n\nIran's attack was in retaliation for a suspected Israeli air strike on the Iranian Embassy's compound in Damascus on April 1 that killed seven Iranian commanders.\n\nTehran's barrage against Israel was highly telegraphed and aimed at deterring future Israeli attacks, experts said. But its response to the killing of Haniyeh on Iranian soil could provoke a harsher response.\n\n\"It's much more likely that we will see a combined, orchestrated attack against Israel\" from Iran and the so-called axis of resistance, Tehran's loose network of militant groups and proxies that aid it in opposing Israel and the United States, said Zimmt.\n\n\"This makes the situation much more complicated because the consequences of an Iranian and Hizballah attack would probably be worse than what happened in April,\" he added. \"That certainly brings us closer to the possibility of a regional campaign.\"\n\nHizballah and Iran-backed militant groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen have carried out attacks against Israel after it launched its devastating war in Gaza, which came shortly after Hamas's October 7 attack in Israel that killed around 1,200 people.\n\nEven as Iran's hostilities with Israel decreased after April, it was \"only a matter of time before the next phase of direct confrontation\" between the archfoes, said Hamidreza Azizi, a fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.\n\n\"This might be the most dangerous moment in the region in the past few years,\" he added.\n\nHard To Rein In\n\nThere has been a flurry of diplomacy in the region aimed at easing the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\nJordan's foreign minister made a rare visit to Tehran on August 4, during which he pleaded for peace.\n\nIran has insisted that it is not looking to escalate tensions but that it has a \"legitimate right\" to hit Israel.\n\n\"As far as the violation of our territorial integrity is concerned, we will not make any compromises,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said on August 5.\n\nA direct Iran-Israel war would likely drag in the entire region, including Tehran's proxy allies, including Hizballah in Lebanon, the Huthi rebels in Yemen, Hamas in the Palestinian territories, and pro-Iranian militias in Iraq.\n\nAny conflict would also likely draw in the United States, Israel's key ally, which has sent additional warships and fighter jets to the region.\n\nOn August 5, a U.S. spokesperson confirmed that \"several\" American personnel were injured in a rocket attack claimed by pro-Iran fighters on a military base in Iraq.\n\nAli Vaez, the director of Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, said that signals from Tehran suggest that \"they are intent on a larger response\" with more drastic consequences.\n\nIf Iran's potential attack causes significant damage and casualties, \"containing the escalatory cycle becomes far more difficult,\" Vaez warned.\n\n\"This is without doubt the closest we've been to\" a direct face-off between Iran, Israel, and their allies, he said.\n\nSayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed Lebanon-based group Hizballah, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, said Israel's recent actions will not go without a \"strong and effective\" response amid fears of a full-blown war in the region.\n\nHizballah said six of its fighters were killed in Israeli attacks on August 6, while it claimed to have launched missiles and drones at Israel, though no casualties were immediately reported.\n\nFor months, Israel and Hizballah have traded constant cross-border attacks -- including a deadly rocket attack from Lebanon on July 27 that hit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 youths and children -- that have killed many and displaced thousands of people.\n\nPressure has continued to build since strikes killed top military commander Fuad Shukr in a Beirut suburb and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, which has also been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, in Iran.\n\nTehran is Hizballah's main ally, and the Lebanese militant group is a key member of Iran's so-called axis of resistance, a loose network of militant groups and proxies that aid it in opposing Israel and the United States.\n\nHizballah is also considered a key part of Iran's efforts to deter Israel or Washington from going to war against Tehran.\n\nTehran \"finds itself obliged to respond, and the enemy is waiting in a great state of dread,\" Nasrallah said in a televised address on August 6 to mark one week since Shukr's death.\n\n“Whatever the consequences, the resistance will not let these Israeli attacks pass by,\" he added, saying that Hizballah will respond \"alone or in the context of a unified response from all the axis\" of Iran-backed groups in the region, \"whatever the consequences.\"\n\nExperts say no side wants an all-out war in a region that has been reeling since Israel launched its war against Hamas after it killed some 1,200 people in a raid and took 240 people hostage on October 7.\n\nHizballah has not usually shied away from claiming attacks on Israeli targets. But it issued a rare denial of responsibility after the attack that killed the children and youths in the Golan Heights.\n\nIsrael has not claimed responsibility for the two recent assassinations, but it has admitted to killing other senior Hamas leaders, including Saleh al-Arouriand Mohammed Deif, the movement's military commander.\n\nHamidreza Azizi, a fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, recently told RFE/RL that if war did break out, members of the \"axis of resistance\" would likely intensify their attacks against Israel while also targeting U.S. troops and bases in the region in a bid to pressure Washington to rein in Israel.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on August 5 called it a \"critical moment\" for the region and said Washington was \"engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock\" to help calm tensions amid fears Iran is preparing a retaliatory strike against Israel over Haniyeh's assassination in the Iranian capital.\n\nAs the world waits to see how and when Iran carries out its promised response to Haniyeh's assassination, Hamas named its Gaza leader, Yahya Sinwar, as Haniyeh's successor.\n\nSinwar is considered the architect of the October 7 attack on Israel, and is believed to be in hiding in Gaza, evading Israeli attempts to kill him since the start of the war."
