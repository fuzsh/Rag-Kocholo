[Harvnb|Zinn|1999; Harvnb|Schirmer|1972]\n\nFilipino collaboration with America\n\nSome of Aguinaldo's associates supported America, even before hostilities began. Pedro Paterno, Aguinaldo's prime minister and the author of the 1897 armistice treaty with Spain, advocated the incorporation of the Philippines into the United States in 1898. Other associates sympathetic to the U.S. were Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Benito Legarda, prominent members of Congress; Gregorio Araneta, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Justice; and Felipe Buencamino, Aguinaldo's Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Buencamino is recorded to have said in 1902: \"I am an American and all the money in the Philippines, the air, the light, and the sun I consider American.\" Many such people subsequently held posts in the colonial government.\n\nThe American government organized the Philippine Scouts and Philippine Constabulary, which saw action against resistance groups.\n\nCasualties\n\nIn the official war years, there were 4,196 American soldiers dead, 1,020 of which were from actual combat; the remainder died of disease, and 2,930 were wounded. There were also 2,000 casualties that the Philippine Constabulary suffered during the war, over one thousand of which were fatalities. It should be noted that total Filipino casualties was at the time and still is a highly-debated, argued, and politicized number. It is estimated that some 34,000 Filipino soldiers lost their lives and as many as 200,000 civilians may have died directly or indirectly as a result of the war, most due to a major cholera epidemic that broke out near its end. [ [http://www.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html John M. Gates, “War-Related Deaths in the Philippines”, \"Pacific Historical Review\" , v. 53, No. 3 (August, 1984), 367-378.] ] [ [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3639234 John M. Gates, War-Related Deaths in the Philippines, 1898-1902 The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 53, No. 3 (Aug., 1984), pp. 367-378] ] Philippine military deaths are estimated at 20,000 with 16,000 actually counted, while civilian deaths numbered between 250,000 and 1,000,000 Filipinos. These numbers take into account those killed by war, malnutrition, and a cholera epidemic that raged during the war. [Harvnb|Smallman-Raynor|1998] The Philippine-American War Centennial Initiative gives an estimate of 510,000 civilian deaths, and 20,000 military deaths, excluding 100,000 deaths from the Moro Rebellion.Fact|date=April 2007 The American military and Philippine Constabulary still suffered periodic losses combating small bands of Moro guerrillas in the far south until 1913.\n\nThe high Filipino casualty figures were a combination of the superior arms and even more superior numbers of the Americans, who were equipped with the most modern, up-to-date weapons in the world, including superb Krag-Jørgensen bolt-action rifles and machine guns, and who were also well-led. Furthermore, U.S. warships stood ready to destroy Philippine positions when needed. In contrast, the Filipinos were armed with a motley collection of rifles such as Mausers and Remingtons, many which had been taken from dead enemy soldiers (including Spanish troops from the previous conflict) or smuggled into the country by their fellow Filipinos. Their artillery was not much better, consisting mostly of worn-out artillery pieces captured from the Spanish. Although they did have a few Maxim and Gatling machine guns, along with a few modern Krupp artillery pieces, these were highly prized and taken to the rear for fear of capture before they could play any decisive role. Ammunition and rifles became more scarce as the war dragged on, and Filipinos were forced to manufacture their own, like the homemade \"paltik\". Still most did not even have firearms. Many used bolos, spears, and lances in fighting, which also contributed to high casualty figures when such obsolete weapons were used against the Americans' superior arms. However, the Filipinos did have the advantage of knowing their own country and rough terrain well, in contrast to the Americans who were fighting on foreign terrain.\n\nIn recognition of United States military service during the Philippine-American War, the United States military created two service decorations which were known as the Philippine Campaign Medal and the Philippine Congressional Medal.\n\nIn 1916 the United States granted the Philippines self-government and promised eventual independence, which came in 1946.\n\nWar crimes\n\nAmerican atrocities\n\n[\n\nright|thumb|200px|General_Jacob H. Smith's infamous order \"KILL EVERY ONE OVER TEN\" was the caption in the \"New York Journal\" cartoon on May 5, 1902. The Old Glory draped an American shield on which a vulture replaced the bald eagle. The bottom caption exclaimed, \"Criminals Because They Were Born Ten Years Before We Took the Philippines\". Published in the \"New York Journal-American\", May 5, 1902.] In 1908 Manuel Arellano Remondo, in \"General Geography of the Philippine Islands\", wrote:“The population decreased due to the wars, in the five-year periodfrom 1895 to 1900, since, at the start of the first insurrection, the population was estimated at 9,000,000, and at present (1908), the inhabitants of the Archipelago do not exceed 8,000,000 in number.” [Harvnb|Boot|2003|p=125]\n\nU.S. attacks into the countryside often included scorched earth campaigns where entire villages were burned and destroyed, torture (\"water cure\") and the concentration of civilians into “protected zones” (\"concentration camps\"). Many of the civilian casualties resulted from disease and famine.\n\nIn an article, \"We Charge Genocide: A Brief History of US in the Philippines\", appearing in the December, 2005 issue of \"Political Affairs\" (an online magazine which bills itself \"Marxist Thought Online\"), E. San Juan, Jr., director of the Philippines Cultural Studies Center, Connecticut, argued that during the Philippine-American War (1899-1902) and pacification campaign (1902-1913), the operations launched by the U.S. against the Filipinos, an integral part of its pacification program, which claimed the lives of over a million Filipinos, constituted genocide.

San Juan, Jr. |date=2005 |accessdate=2008-07-26]\n\nIn November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the \"Philadelphia Ledger\" reported:\"The present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog....\" [quoted in \"A People's History of the United States\" (1980), Howard Zinn, Harper & Row. ISBN 0-06-014803-9]\n\nAmerican soldiers' letters and response\n\nFrom almost the beginning of the war, soldiers wrote home describing the atrocities committed against Filipinos, soldiers and civilians alike. Increasingly, such personal letters, or portions of them, reached a national audience as anti-imperialist editors across the nation reproduced them. [Harvnb|Miller|1982|p=88;\n\n* For a small sampling of some of the letters and statements see: Wikiquote: [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Philippine-American_War#American_Torture_and_Attrocities_against_Filipinos American Torture and Attrocities against Filipinos] , Wikisource: , Wikipedia: Lodge Committee, particularly the testiony of: Charles S. Riley, Private William L Smith, Sergeant Edward J. Davis, and ex-Corporal Richard Thomas O'Brien]\n\nOnce these accounts were widely reproduced, the War Department was forced to demand that General Otis investigate their authenticity. For each press clipping, he forwarded it to the writer’s commanding officer, who would then convince the soldier to write a retraction.\n\nPrivate Charles Brenner of the Kansas regiment resisted such pressure. He insisted that Colonel Funston [New York Sun March 10, 1902; p. 234–235. In 1902 Funston toured the United States speaking to increase public support for the war in the Philippines. He said: “I personally strung up thirty-five Filipinos without trial, so what was all the fuss over Waller's ‘dispatching’ a few ‘treacherous savages’? If there had been more Smiths and Wallers, the war would have been over long ago. Impromptu domestic hanging might also hasten the end of the war. For starters, all Americans who had recently petitioned Congress to sue for peace in the Philippines should be dragged out of their homes and lynched.\"— Colonel Frederick Funston at a banquet in Chicago.] had ordered that all prisoners be shot and that Major Metcalf and Captain Bishop enforced these orders. Otis was obliged to order the Northern Luzon sector commander, General MacArthur, to look into the charge. Brenner confronted MacArthur’s aide with a corroborating witness, Private Putman, who confessed to shooting two prisoners after Bishop or Metcalf ordered, “Kill them! Damn it, Kill them!” MacArthur sent his aide’s report on to Otis with no comment. Otis ordered Brenner court-martialed “for writing and conniving at the publication of an article which... contains willful falsehoods concerning himself and a false charge against Captain Bishop.” The judge advocate in Manila convinced Otis that such a trial could open a Pandora’s box because “facts would develop implicating many others.”\n\nGeneral Otis sent the Brenner case to Washington writing: “After mature deliberation, I doubt the wisdom of court-martial in this case, as it would give the insurgent authorities a knowledge of what was taking place and they would assert positively that our troops had practiced inhumanities, whether the charge should be proven or not, as they would use it as an excuse to defend their own barbarities;” and Otis went on, justifying the war crimes, “and it is not thought that his charge is very grievous under the circumstances then existing, as it was very early in the war, and the patience of our men was under great strain.” [Harvnb|Miller|1982|p=89;* cite journal | author=Storey, Moorfield and Codman, Julian | title= Secretary Root's Record: “Marked Severities” in Philippine Warfare| journal=Philippine Investigating Committee | year= | volume= | issue= | pages= 12–15| url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Secretary_Root%27s_Record:%22Marked_Severities%22_in_Philippine_Warfare#How_Charges_Were_Investigated ]\n\nTowards the end of 1899 General Otis attempted to repair his battered image. He began to work to win new friends among the journalists in Manila and bestowed favors on any journalist who gave him favorable press. [Harvnb|Miller|1982|p=91]\n\nConcentration camps\n\nAs one historian wrote about Marinduque, the first island with concentration camps:: “The triple press of concentration (camps), devastation, and harassment led Abad (the Marinduque commander) ...to request a truce to negotiate surrender terms... The Army pacified Marinduque not by winning the allegiance of the people, but by imposing coercive measures to control their behavior and separate them from the insurgents in the field. Ultimately, military and security measures proved to be the (essential element) of Philippine pacification.” [cite journal | author= Birtle, Andrew J. | title=The U.S. Army's Pacification of Marinduque, Philippine Islands, April 1900 – April 1901 | journal= The Journal of Military History | month= April | year= 1997| volume=61 | issue= | pages=255–282 | url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/49712.html | doi=10.2307/2953967 copyvio link|date=March 2008]\n\nThis assessment could probably be applied to all of the Philippines.\n\nFilipino atrocities\n\nTo counter the bad press back in America, General Otis stated that insurgents tortured American prisoners in “fiendish fashion”, some of whom were buried alive, or worse, up to their necks in anthills to be slowly devoured. Others were castrated, had the removed parts stuffed into their mouths, and were then left to suffocate or bleed to death. It was also stated that some prisoners were deliberately infected with leprosy before being released to spread the disease among their comrades. Spanish priests were horribly mutilated before their congregations, and natives who refused to support Emilio Aguinaldo were slaughtered by the thousands. American newspaper headlines announced the “Murder and Rapine” by the “Fiendish Filipinos.” General “Fighting Joe” Wheeler insisted that it was the Filipinos who had mutilated their own dead, murdered women and children, and burned down villages, solely to discredit American soldiers. [Harvnb|Miller|1982|pp=92–93]\n\nOther events dubbed atrocities included those attributed by the Americans to General Vicente Lukban, allegedly the Filipino commander who masterminded the Balangiga massacre in Samar province, a surprise attack that killed almost fifty American soldiers. Media reports stated that many of the bodies were mutilated. [Harvnb|Boot|2003|p=102] The attack itself triggered American reprisals in Samar, ordered by General Jacob Hurd Smith, who said, \"I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me. I want all persons killed who are capable of bearing arms in actual hostilities against the United States\", and defined this as everyone over ten years old. To his credit, Major Littleton Waller countermanded it to his own men. Nevertheless, some of his men \"undoubtedly\" carried out atrocities. [Harvnb|Miller|1982|p=91]\n\nSergeant Hallock testified in the Lodge Committee that natives were given the water cure, “...in order to secure information of the murder of Private O'Herne of Company I, who had been not only killed, but roasted and otherwise tortured before death ensued.” [Cite news\n\nurl=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9F07E3D61130E132A25757C0A9639C946397D6CF&oref=slogin\n\ntitle=THE WATER CURE DESCRIBED.; Discharged Soldier Tells Senate Committee How and Why the Torture Was Inflicted\n\ndate=May 4, 1902\n\npublisher=The New York Times\n\npage=13\n\naccessdate=2008-03-29]"
