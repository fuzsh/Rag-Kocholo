        "text": "During this season of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, the latest issue of INSiGHT is an invitation to rise above consumerism, secularism, and racism. Youâ€™ll find voices of Hming Sangi (PCM) advocating for gender justice; Bianca Gallant (PKN) on racism entrenched in the Dutch Christmas tradition; the fight for freedom from slavery one Christmas in Jamaica; the wonderful gift of worship and much more. In this season of revelry, may we pause to heed lesser-heard, marginalised voices and rise up to transformative action in the world so that all may rejoice in the hope, peace and goodwill our Saviour came to bring. Be inspired, be informed. Welcome to INSiGHT."
