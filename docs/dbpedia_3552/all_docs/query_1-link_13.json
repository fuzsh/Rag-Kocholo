Maximum loads assume a realistic mass not designed for lifting.

Just being sure, because that would be 19 strength, not 24. 24 strength is to lift 700 overhead, and 19 is to lift 700 off the ground (max load of 350 doubled).\n\nVod Canockers\n\nDM Jelani wrote:\n\nI've recently come across the fact that there are people out there (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Colombo, Reg Park, Layne Norton, etc) who could/can deadlift 700+ lbs.

The current deadlift record is just over 1000 pounds. That is a STR of 22. Given that he is wearing a weight belt, that could accout for a plus two. The absolute record, with some specialized equipment is just under 1200 pounds, STR 23.\n\nNot surprisingly the world record for the Clean and Jerk, lifting from the ground to an overhead position, is 581 pounds, or STR 23, again using a weight belt.\n\nAshiel\n\n2 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nAlso keep in mind that they'd need to be able to stagger around with the weight relatively indefinitely. Can those fellows lift those items and walk across the stage without their bodies giving out? Without special braces for lifting and/or avoiding injury after all. Because a 24 Str character doesn't need special equipment to lift 700 lbs. off the ground and walk around with it slowly without risking injury.\n\nBigDTBone\n\nDM Jelani wrote:\n\nI've recently come across the fact that there are people out there (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Colombo, Reg Park, Layne Norton, etc) who could/can deadlift 700+ lbs.

The D&D rules also don't differentiate beetween what is lifted. It's easy to grab a bar, but more awkward objects will require more strength and skills. Atlas Stones might be a better way to judge a D&D characters strength.\n\nThymus Vulgaris\n\nI3igAl wrote:\n\nSauce987654321 wrote:\n\nBigDTBone wrote:\n\nDM Jelani wrote:\n\nI've recently come across the fact that there are people out there (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Colombo, Reg Park, Layne Norton, etc) who could/can deadlift 700+ lbs.

So for the 580 lbs. record in clean and jerk, you would need a strength score of 18.\n\nFor the 1000 lbs. deadlifts, 22 should do it.\n\nHenshinFanatic\n\nActually while strength plays a role, technique so that you don't injure yourself while doing such actions is just as important. I'd peg that as Profession (Weightlifter) which when performed well (i.e. beating the DC) provides a circumstance bonus to carrying capacity for the rest of your turn, with the bonus getting bigger the better you perform.\n\nShasfowd\n\nWell people, remember that 'average' human capabilities are 9's, so that means that we should only be able to lift 30 lbs with ease, which sounds a bit small.\n\nThymus Vulgaris\n\nI'm pretty sure average human capabilities are 10 for any given stat. I wouldn't complain about the notion that 30 pounds would make me encumbered. That's just over 6 large (2 litre) bottles of soda, which I know for a fact would have an effect on me. Then again I am not a very strong person, but it doesn't seem too off for me.\n\n(Then again (again) I'm also comparing it to carrying a bag with 3 bottles of soda in each hand with plastic straps gnawing into my fingers, which is by no means an optimal way to carry anything)\n\nEDIT: Or maybe it does seem off, but it's not too little. If anything, it seems like a little much to carry without being encumbered.\n\ndeusvult\n\nWhile one might argue that magic can (more than) compensate for modern understandings of nutrition and physiology, the real rub is economics.\n\nThe Arnolds and Francos of the real world don't apply to the (typical) fantasy milieu is because in the real world it's simply possible to be a professional bodybuilder. Peasants and plebians simply don't have that kind of free time because they're fulltime pig farmers or blacksmiths' apprentices. Or if they're highborn, they have all that time tied up in classical instruction.\n\nSure, there's a potential flaw in that argument. Look at the Conan the Barbarian movie! Conan (played by the Arnold) got all Arnoldy just by pushing a millstone! My response is \"Yeah, well, there had to have been something else going on there. Offscreen, they clearly must have fed him magical brute fuel or something. It doesn't matter anyway... he's as big as Arnold because he's played by Arnold, afterall.\"\n\nIf that whole train of thought isn't compelling, then consider a meta one:\n\nSometimes the rules just don't make sense. Carrying capacities and strength values are pretty damn arbitrary, anyway. How come an Ogre with 16 strength that can benchpress a schoolbus can't deal as much damage as a Halfling with 18 strength that couldn't benchpress half as much?\n\nMy favorite is that environmental damage doesn't scale with hit dice. Why does falling from a great height hurt any less depending on how much you know about defending yourself from melee attacks? Why does the flesh of a newbie adventurer burn so much faster than the flesh of a veteran one?\n\nLazarX\n\nShasfowd wrote:\n\nWell people, remember that 'average' human capabilities are 9's, so that means that we should only be able to lift 30 lbs with ease, which sounds a bit small.\n\nYou try lugging 4 gallons of milk some time and come back to us.\n\nSauce987654321\n\ndeusvult wrote:\n\nIf that whole train of thought isn't compelling, then consider a meta one:\n\nSometimes the rules just don't make sense.

Characters aren't just learning how to deal with melee weapons, they have to deal with breath weapons, firearms, spells, siege weapons etc.. It wouldn't make sense to scale environmental damage when nothing else does.\n\nCuuniyevo\n\nOgre with 16 strength: 2d6+3 (10 damage on average) damage with a Large Battleaxe.\n\nHalfling with 18 strength: 1d6+4 (7.5 damage on average) with a Small Battleaxe. If the Halfing tried to use a Medium battleaxe, they'd get 1d8+4 (8.5 damage on average) but have -2 attack, and they'd have to use it two-handed. They would not be allowed to use a Large Battleaxe at all.\n\nOgre with 16 strength: Lift and stagger about with 920 lbs (230 x2 for size, x2 again for staggering).\n\nHalfling with 18 strength: Lift and stagger about with 450 lbs (300 x.75 for size, x2 for staggering).\n\nOn a side note, Jean Valjean (from Les Miserables) performs feats of strength on a number of occasions, and he was based on a real person. One of the instances involved a heavy cart of some sort (I don't have the book on-hand while I type this), which would probably weigh 200-600lbs when empty, according to the CRB. If the cart were loaded, and assuming he'd only have to lift half of the weight, due to it being levered off the ground, he may have been in the 18-20 Str range. I'll have to check the book later, to get more details on the incident.\n\ndeusvult\n\nSauce987654321 wrote:\n\ndeusvult wrote:\n\nIf that whole train of thought isn't compelling, then consider a meta one:\n\nSometimes the rules just don't make sense.

The halfling's power is only sufficient to lift 300 pounds in the same way. The Ogre has about a 5/3 advantage in raw power (depending on how one defines and measures horsepower..) yet is doing only 2/3 as much \"bonus damage\" based on the variable of raw power. (or 3/4 as much bonus-from-strength damage, if there were an apples-to-apples way to compare w/o the 2-h bonus)\n\nQuote:\n\nMy favorite is that environmental damage doesn't scale with hit dice.

So if strength is nonsensical, there's proof that it's hardly a unique \"failure\" in the rules. They're just arbitrary lines drawn for meta concerns (like playability).

They even have the same wrong-size penalty to hit.\n\nIf there's going to be a fair comparison of the impact of strength on damage, all variables outside of strength need to be removed. Making comparisons on different weapons is comparing apples to oranges. Of course the Ogre can do more damage with a huge sized bastard sword than a Halfling can with a tiny sized dagger. So what? It's bringing factors outside of strength into a discussion about strength (most notably, the disparity of base damage dice). Equally valueless as comparing large and small size weapons for the same purpose.\n\nWhen comparing the role of strength values in damage, the weapons are either identical or irrelevant.\n\nQuote:\n\nI'm not saying it SHOULD scale.. was just saying it's nonsensical.\n\nQuote:\n\nIn any case, it was a design choice to make higher level characters survive giant falls and such.

The reason the ogre has more damage dice and average damage with his unarmed attacks is because he is bigger and stronger, same reason it has a greater carrying capacity. You're just focusing on just the strength score for some reason instead of other factors, such as being bigger gives you more damage with natural weapons, unarmed damage, wield bigger weapons, increased carrying capacity and strength checks to break doors. Yes the halfling does more damage with using the exact same size weapon, but is weaker in every other comparison and category.\n\ndeusvult\n\nSauce987654321 wrote:\n\nI did give them the same weapon, by using a brawler or monk for unarmed damage instead of forcing them to use inappropriate sized weapons.

Real life is not weighing fully in. The 16 strength on an ogre has more raw muscle power than 18 strength on a Halfling, yet for metagame reasons that \"greater\" strength (the 16) results in smaller in-game bonuses than the \"lesser\" strength (the 18). It's not just melee damage bonus: the 16 strength ogre is less likely to succeed on a strength check than the 18 strength Halfling. Again, despite the Ogre being able to exert much more force.\n\nDerron42\n\nDM Jelani wrote:\n\nI've recently come across the fact that there are people out there (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Colombo, Reg Park, Layne Norton, etc) who could/can deadlift 700+ lbs.

Seems the only way to get above 20 in PF is magic of one sort or another (or being really high level, which no one on Earth is). Maybe there should be some mechanic for training ability scores.

Total beast.\n\nBob Bob Bob\n\nThe reason an 18 Str Halfling hits harder than a 16 Str Ogre is because the halfling knows how to use their strength more effectively. When they swing they put their weight behind it. This is really obvious with strength checks and break DCs. The ogre can never bend iron bars. The halfling can (5% of the time).\n\nAlso, part of the design of monsters includes giving them higher strength if they're larger. You can see it in the monster creation rules and the polymorph rules. That 16 Str Ogre, reduced to Medium, would lose either 4 or 8 Str. So it's kind of a puny Large creature.\n\nSauce987654321\n\nYeah, ogres typically have 21, anyway.

This was done with the use of a weight belt.\n\nThe world record for the dead lift is just under 1200 lbs which is double the max for 23 STR. This was done with some specialized equipment along with a weight belt. (I doubt that they could stagger for any time while lifting this weight.)\n\nKazaan\n\nA few things.\n\n1: It takes 19 Str to deadlift (lift off the ground, but not overhead) 700 lbs. This is achievable by a lvl 1 Human with 17 Str +2 racial.\n\n2: Professional weightlifters are probably not lvl 1. A lvl 4 Human could have started with 16 Str +2 racial and put his lvl 4 boost into Str.\n\n3: Professional weightlifters probably focus more on carrying capacity and probably invest in feats/abilities/gear that boost carrying capacity. Muleback cords/Heavyload Belt, syringe of potion of Ant Haul, etc can boost effective Str score for determining carry capacity as can traits like Muscle of the Society.\n\n4: Abilities that boost Str like Rage can temporarily increase carry capacity. An Urban Barbarian can use controlled rage for maximal Str score in such a manner, getting +4 to Str right from lvl 1.\n\nSo, a lvl 1 character with Muscle of the Society for +2 \"carry Str\" Heavyload Belt for triple encumbrance can start with a natural 12 Str, including racial bonus (a considerably strong \"normal\" human by PF standards), and add an effective 2 to that bringing them to 14 and, with constant Ant Haul from the belt, with 14 Str, he can lift 525lbs overhead and 1050lbs deadlift while still only having 12 \"actual\" str for determining combat attack and damage rolls. I doubt Arnold or most other body-builders would fare well in actual combat even if you gave them a Greatsword.\n\nThe Human Diversion\n\nAnother thing we might want to consider is population: in a given medieval fantasy setting, an Earth-like world might hold at most 4-5 hundred million people.

Pathfinder doesn't emulate this well becasue why on earth would there be rules for it in a fantasy adventure game?

Then feats and equipement would modify it.\n\nIts not just raw strength. The game isn't meant to model it, and it really shouldn't. It models things likely to be associated with adventurers going on adventures. Even when lifting things, adventures generally dont hike a specially designed weight above their heads, leave it there for a second or two and then drop it. Hence, its not part of the lifting/carrying rules, which are meant for long term lifting and carrying of things, which adventures might very well do.\n\nSauce987654321\n\nLosobal wrote:\n\nHm, if we were going by rules, I'd say its closer to \"they did really well on Str related checks for the individual instance, rather than the overall strength rating of <X>\"\n\nI agree with this, considering that a Str of 23 (+6) can burst rope, manacles, and chain at that level of strength.\n\n1 to 50 of 52 << first < prev | 1 | 2 | next > last >>\n\nCommunity / Forums / Pathfinder / Pathfinder First Edition / General Discussion / Real Humans With 24+ strength?
