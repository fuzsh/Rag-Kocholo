        "text": "Introduction[]\n\nThe purpose of this page made here is to explain where each AP and Tier are referred to and located at, as seen on the Attack Potency and Tiering System pages we have here respectively. This is so that newcomers and perhaps even veterans to this wiki will know where each level of Potency (Tier-wise), once again, is referred to.\n\nFor this, we are going to be using VS Battle's Tiering and AP (Attack Potency) system's which is what FC/OC always uses but also will be using Real Life Events/Phenomenon's as our base references (something that the OBD seems to use for theirs' as a way of their own reference page). The page will also be containing calc's that any user here has made thus far. All in all, the Real Life Events, User Calc's, and/or otherwise put here will be used mainly for comparison purpose's, where they land at in terms of which end of the spectrum they are in for each AP & Tier, etc. (This being done in a manner similar to that of\n\nKeep in mind that this will only be able to cover 10-C to 3-A, as Tier 11, High 3-A, Tier 2, Tier 1, and Tier 0 do not resolve around destruction of energy, matter, or anything of the sort (see the Attack Potency and Tiering System pages linked above for more info about these tiers)\n\nAs noted on the Attack Potency page, we have a thing regarding the use of the \"+\" symbol. Much like VS Battles wiki, here the \"+\" is used to indicate that a characters Attack Potency is greater than the average (arithmetic mean) of the high end energy level and low end energy level of a particular tier.\n\nEnergy Scale[]\n\nBelow Average Human (~0-40 Joules) (10-C)[]\n\nPretty straightforward. This Tier and AP is for those whose below the average human in strength and power and other such.\n\nHuman (40-100 Joules) (10-B)[]\n\nExamples:\n\nAthlete (100-300 Joules) (10-A)[]\n\nExamples:\n\nKE of a typical 32 gr. .22 LR bullet: 191 Joules (Athlete level+)\n\nStreet level (300-15,000 Joules) (9-C)[]\n\nExamples:\n\nMaximum KE of a baseball bat: 481.7 Joules (Street level)\n\nKE of a 9mm round: 570 Joules (Street level)\n\nHighest muzzle energy of a .45 ACP round: 835 Joules (Street level)\n\nHighest muzzle energy/KE of a .357 Magnum round: 1,087 Joules (Street level)\n\nKE of a IMI Desert Eagle Round (Strongest Caliber): 2200 Joules/2.2 Kilojoules (Street level)\n\nFirepower of an AIAW Rifle firing a 7.62x51mm NATO round (type M80 FMJ): 3,304 Joules/3.3 Kilojoules (Street level)\n\nFirepower of a S&W 500 shooting an FTX Hornady round: 3,888 Joules/3.888 Kilojoules (Street level)\n\nAverage firepower of a 12-Gauge Slug: 4700 Joules/4.7 Kilojoules (Street level)\n\nFirepower of a .458 Winchester Magnum (strongest round): 7,336 Joules (Street level)\n\nMaximum firepower of a .700 Nitro Express round: 12,100 Joules (Street level+)\n\nEnergy to destroy a human head: 12,812.8 - 37,564.8 Joules (VS Battles Wiki) (Street level+)\n\nWall level (15,000 Joules-0.005 Tons) (9-B)[]\n\nWall level. This tier refers to the destruction of a wall (something solid and thick like a brick or concrete wall, for instance).\n\nExample:\n\nLowest energy yield of a 14.5x114mm round: 29,850 Joules (Wall level)\n\nFirepower of a depleted 30mm uranium round fired from a GAU-8 Avenger: 200,000 Joules/200 Kilojoules (Wall level)\n\nBlitz smashes Explotzer onto a wall: 1,212,186.44145 Joules (Wall Level)\n\nFreezed Touch spell: 3,623,391.11 Joules (Wall level) (A Light in the Darkness)\n\nAce's Durability: 5,217,204.21 Joules (Wall level) (A Light in the Darkness)\n\nRoom/Small Building level (0.005-0.25 Tons) (9-A) []\n\nThis Tier and AP refers to any character or weapon capable of destroying an entire room lot or a small building (ex. a one-story sized building).\n\nExamples:\n\nEnergy required to freeze someone: 2.2339065e7 J (Room level)\n\nEnergy required to vaporize a human being: ~300 Megajoules (Small Building level)\n\nExamples:\n\nBuilding level (0.25-2 Tons) (8-C)[]\n\nThis tier and AP refers to destroying a building or a structure much bigger than a small building or room. Something like destroying a 2-3 story building may suffice enough to become of this Tier and AP.\n\nExamples:\n\nDurability required to resist the heat of the Sun (the surface): 0.3 Tons (Building level) (Note: This is for a human in the sun.

Z)\n\nLarge Building level (2-11 Tons) (High 8-C)[]\n\nThis Tier and AP is referred to characters or weapons that are able to destroy a larger than average sized building, typically something like a Skyscraper.\n\nExamples:\n\nDestruction of a Boeing 747 aircraft: 3.88 Tons - 71.37 Tons (Large Building level - City Block level+)\n\nObliterating a Landkreuzer (Low End) 9.26 Tons (Large Building level+)\n\nMk-54 (Davy Crockett) Artillery Warhead: 10 Tons - 20 Tons (Large Building level+, Low-End; City Block, High End)\n\nMk-54 (SADM) Device: 10 Tons - 1 Kilotons (Large Building level+, Low End; Multi City Block+, High End)\n\nCity Block level (11-100 Tons) (8-B)[]\n\nCity Block level.

This AP rank refers to the destruction of more than one solar system (ex. our own star system and that of Alpha Centauri). As noted specifically on the Attack Potency page on this, this AP rank can only be granted if a character wiped out, at minimum, two star systems with a spherical-shaped blast powerful enough to wipe out both of said systems contents at the same time rather than simply doubling the value of Solar System busting.
