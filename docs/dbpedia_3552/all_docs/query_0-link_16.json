        "text": "Invasion of Macapagal II\n\nNews of Magat III's death reached the entirety of the Philippine archipelago controlled by the Spanish from August 30-September 7, 1710.\n\nTaking advantage of the chaos in Tondo, the king of Pampanga Macapagal III (1650s-1718), mobilized his armies to take the thrones of not just Tondo, but also Bulacan. It was also to take revenge for its participation 4 decades prior. From the town of Minalin, Macapagal III marched down to Bulacan, where they successfully took the towns of Quingua[1], Calumpit and Angat[2]. They met the armies of Antonio of Bulacan on the grasslands of barrio Cambaog[1], in Quingua.\n\nSpanish volunteers of Macapagal III in Barrio Cambaog, September 23, 1710​\n\nThe Kapampangans, due to reforms made by Macapagal II in the 1680s and 1690s, as well as recovering from the wrath of the Pampanga war during his grandfather's (Macapagal I) tenure, whipped the Bulaqueños in Barrio Cambaog thanks to the newly forged artillery as well as their new military doctrine. Antonio was forced to flee to the town of Santa Maria[3], and tried to fend off the army of 3,000 led by Macapagal II in the battle of Hacienda Pandi, but was again defeated that same day.\n\nUndeterred, he decided to lanuch surprise attacks. He dispersed his troops throughout the rest of Bulacan, to confuse the enemy. However, instead Macapagal II directly marched to Bulakan, the capital where they immediately took over and established control of Bulacan, only in the territories they controlled. Antonio then fled to the southern town of Polo[4], where from there travelled to Marikina to request help.\n\nDefence of Lacandola III\n\nAndres Felipe, the surviving son of Magat II Sancho, decided to declare himself king of Tondo with the support of everyone, ranging from the peasantry to his ministers. He decided to call himself Lacandola III in honor of the first Lacandola.\n\nHe immediately organized a force of 5,000 men, joined with over 500 survivors of the Bulaqueño army led by Antonio. He ordered another thousand men to defend the capital Marikina from Macapagal III's forces. From his base at Marikina, he marched and reached barrio Tatalon in Tondo town on September 30, where they encountered the forces of Macapagal II approaching the town of San Juan del Monte, and from there, Marikina. He decided to engage them by deploying a decoy force to attack them, while another force shall cut off their supply truck. The main force led by Lacandola himself shall quietly execute a maneuver by marching his force north then launch a surprise attack towards Macapagal III's forces signaled by firing a cannon towards their flank.\n\nSituation as of October 5, 1710\n\n​\n\nLacandola, being a skilled tactician and military commander serving the army since he was only young, at 17 years old. He had proven his military prowess in the years of his service. Using his superior knowledge of the terrain and roads, he was able to inflict a decisive defeat against Macapagal by destroying his supply line and inflicting heavy casualties of 400, most of them being professionals despite in a short number of artillery. He also captured tons of ammunition and artilery left behind by the Kapampangans in retreat.\n\nThat however, does not stop Macapagal in pursuing his goals. After the initial defeat, on October 5 he decided to camp in the town of Sampaloc, just a few miles away from Tatalon to resupply. After that, he decided to forcibly divert Lacandola's attention in defending Marikina by besieging the town of Malabon[5], in the hopes that this would force Lacandola to march and tear down the siege, which would make way for another force coming from occupied Bulacan to capture Marikina. Unfortunately, some soldiers from Hagonoy had a timely arrival to the town and decided to fend off the Kapampangans by firing cannons at them. Macapagal decided to take revenge by capturing the town instead, however, while his troops were crossing down the Tullahan to take the poblacion, once most of Macapagal's forces were on the other side, all bridges were ordered to be blown up with locally-made lantakas right next to the bridges.\n\nSome soldiers of the Tondo Obrero Company joining the Hagonoy rgt's charge​\n\nThe Hagonoy regiment, with 2 other regiments as well as farmers and workers holding either bolos, spears or any Qing-imported guns that were smuggled, attacked the trapped Kapampangans like hyenas chasing its prey. The desperate Kapampangans tried to flee the attackers, with some swimming back to the other side with wounds, while others are making boats out of whatever object they could find. The attack was successful, and it cost Macapagal over 700 casualties mostly professionals, with over 250 of them becoming POWs. He then returned to Bulakan in October 7, suffering defeat and humiliation.\n\nDays later, he constructed the Tauiran-Camarin Line, a series of fortifications, often made due to polo y servicios enforced by Macapagal III's ministers in Bulacan.\n\nRecapture of Bulacan\n\nThe next days saw both sides trying to regain their strengths during the previous engagements.\n\nThe temporary ceasefire would be broken once more, on the day of December 10, when Macapagal sent a force of 500 to attack the recaptured town of Meycauayan[6], to try and launch a conquest of Tondo once again. However, due to the incompetence of the leading captain, they were instantly repelled by 250 men defending the province through combined tactics of skirmish and firing from fortifications.\n\nLater, the Kapampangans later saw themselves under attack, when a force of 1,000 from Malabon and San Mateo, as well as rebels operating in Bulacan initiated a siege of Bulakan on December 15. By this point only Bulakan, and the towns of Quingua, Calumpit and Angat still remain under Kapampangan control. They tightened around the town, and blocked all roads towards the town in an effort to forcibly surrender Macapagal. However they have no need to effort the siege, as Macapagal suddenly retreated on December 19 when he received news from scouts who skipped through the blocked roads from the north that Andres II of Pangasinan (1668-1719) had invaded Pampanga to capture territories from the duchy of Pantabangan.\n\nBy December 23, all Kapampangan troops had gradually retreated back to Pampanga.\n\nTreaty of Bacolor\n\nMacapagal later realized that Pangasinan attacking in the north, and a combined force of Bulacan and Tondo attacking in the south would cause a fatal effect on his reputation as king of Pampanga, so he decided to sign a treaty with both Bulacan and Tondo through his ministers sent to the town of Paombong on January 4, 1711.\n\nIn it, a permanent peace was obtained on both sides through the diplomatic skills of each sides. However, Antonio demanded that over 500,000 pesos shall be paid as war indemnities, or else war continues. The Kapampangans refused, and the two sides were close to warring each other again, but the Tondenses intervened and they all decided that the indemnity shall be paid but only 300,000 pesos, and a clause that for 10 years of the signing of this treaty, until the day of September 1, 1721 that prohibits Pampanga from sending, attacking and intervening in Bulacan and Tondo.\n\nAlthough managing to secure peace, the last days of Antonio saw relations with Tondo becoming sour. This brief period would end in his death that same year, and saw the ascension of his son Miguel Pedro as duke of Bulacan, where relations returned to normal as usual.\n\n[1] - Included Baliwag until 1733 (itself included Bustos until 1867. Reannexed in 1901(?) and separated in 1916) and Pulilan until 1796(?)\n\n[2] - Included San Rafael until 1750 (itself inculded San Ildefonso until 1877. Annexed to San Miguel from 1905 until 1906)\n\n[3] - Included Pandi from 1793 until 1870\n\n[4] - Included Obando until 1753 and Novaliches (now divided between Caloocan and Quezon City since 1948) until 1855\n\n[5] - Included Navotas until 1856 (Reannexed in 1903 and separated in 1905)\n\n[6] - Meycauayan from 1623 to 1796 included San Jose del Monte until 1752 and Marilao until 1796\n\nNote: Portrait 1 shows Spanish soldiers in the War of the Spanish Succession(?) and portrait 2 shows French soldiers in the French and Indian War in colonial America and Canada.\n\nConquest of Bataan and Maragondon\n\nBelieving that the time has come, Magat V ordered a mobilization of about 5,000 men designed to conquer Bataan on April 1, 1754. About 6 ships, 3 for transportation of men and the other 3 for carrying the supplies. Cavite under the now duke Paco I (a nickname for Fransisco) also prepared for the annexation of barrio Maragondon[1] from Pampanga. Meanwhile Bulacan under Silvestre declared a state of neutrality as to prevent his state from becoming another battleground between Tondo and Pampanga. The Bulaqueño army at this time numbered 7,000 out of 89,000.\n\nKapampangan authorities at Maragondon reported to Macapagal IV (1710s-1775) that the Caviteños began amassing a number of soldiers on the Caviteño-Kapampangan border starting in June. The king however, scuffed at the report as he believed that the Caviteño army was too weak (having only 2,000 men) compared to Pampanga's (over 17,600). What he did not knew is that this would only serve as a distraction as attested in the grand plan drafted by Cavite and Tondo that it would lure most of the fighting force from Pampanga, to allow way for the Tondenses to swiftly conquer Bataan, while Cavite gains Maragondon. Another plan, this time with Bulacan involved, calls for the conquest of the territories of the former Kapampangan territories of the Calumpit alcaldia, abolished after most of it became part of the duchy of Bulacan in 1578.\n\nOn July 9, 1745, Paco I led the invasion of Maragondon by attacking the Kapampangans unnoticed at Batas[2] at dawn. The surprised Kapampangans were instantly defeated, and by July 12, only the barangay of Ternate remained under Spanish rule. It coincided with a decree five days earlier from Pedro Manuel de Arandía Santisteban, governor-general from 1754 to 1759, that formally separated back Bataan from Pampanga to Spanish ownership. However, Arandia later recognized his northern neighbor's sovereignty of the area due to the fact that Tondo was highly valuable for Spain in the archipelago as a partner for combating Moro raids in southern Luzon and Mindanaoan conquest.\n\nThe authorities desperately requested help from Bacolor, and in which Pampanga declared war on Cavite by the 15th. Macapagal sent a force of 600 to help quell the invasion. They arrived at the coastal town of Mariveles on July 20, and was preparing for a crossing of the Corregidor channel to Ternate. However, the Tondense navy along with its army, landed at Balanga[3] that day later. From Balanga, they commited a swift conquest of the province along with a cannonizing campaign at the town of Lubao up north. To the Tondenses' amazement, the Zambal town-state of Subic[4] declared war on Tondo and garrisoned Morong de Bataan. However, they were crushed at the town and was forced to retreat back to Subic. They tried to attack again, and defeated. As punishment Tondo marched and overthrowed the gobernadorcillo, annexing Subic in the process.\n\nAfter the initial attack at Morong and Subic, they marched back down south and besieged Mariveles on July 17. The Kapampangans were forced to hold out against the city, while their comrades perished under Caviteño attacks. After 5 days, on July 22 the garrison surrendered, and the commander signed the treaty of Balanga, in which it recognized Bataan and Maragondon as parts of Tondo and Cavite respectively. As a pardon, Magat incorporated the Kapampangan garrison into his own army in return for land ownership in Bataan.\n\nTreaty of Balanga (1754)\n\n​\n\nKapampangan counteroffensive and war expansion down south\n\nSome of the Kapampangan party involved in the treaty returned to Pampanga, bringing with them a full request from Magat that he would recognize the status quo of Bataan and Maragondon. Macapagal, due to geostrategic and economic reasons, blatantly refused, and immediately organized a force of 7,000 that would bring back Bataan, and possibly Maragondon under their fold. They arrived at Hermosa[5] on July 24. Macapagal also called on upon his new allies in Katagalugan: the duchy of Tabuco[6] and the town-states of Tanay, Baras, Binangonan[7], Pilila[8] and Morong[9] to converge and attack Tondo and its enclave of Paquil, Cavite and the town-states of Siniloan[10], Mabitac and Santa Maria, who were Tondo's allies in southern Katagalugan. Thus, the war expanded to these regions. The Spanish sided with Pampanga, under Arandia in the hopes that it would formally annex the towns near Manila that were, in paper Spanish but mostly Tondense. He also wanted to retake Cavite Nuevo where all Spanish galleons for the Manila-Acapulco trade were built.\n\nTo help him in his war, Magat restored Subic back as an independent state, although at this time a vassal of Tondo for the next 50 years. There is also a clause that it would never attack Tondo another time.\n\nAs his first move, he besieged Orani, a town that is the road towards Mariveles, in which where Magat and his army was located. Magat, receiving news that the enemy was now in their soil, marched from Mariveles to the besieged town, from July 27 to 28. He then turned the siege into a battle by formally charging at the enemy with carabaos, that shattered the Kapampangan lines. Macapagal was forced to retreat back to Hermosa, where he re-organized his forces. He decided that since Tondo is superior on land, he launched the naval forces of Pampanga, of which numbered 50 compared to Tondo's 25.\n\nFrom Hermosa, they marched and retook Morong de Bataan on August 1, with heavy resistance from both soldiers and civilians alike. Macapagal responded harshly by disarming all people present there, as well as imposing curfews. Meanwhile, another battle took place at Abucay on August 3, due to several skirmishes between the Tondenses and Kapampangans who advanced but later retreated to Hermosa.\n\nIn the southern Tagalog heartland, Cavite defeated Tabuco at the battle of Barrio Malagasang on August 10, occupying Tabuceño land that overstreches from the town of San Pedro. The principalities of Morong and Binangonan undertook several attacks on the Tondense towns of San Mateo[11], Taytay and Bosoboso[12], but was repulsed by forces defending the area. Siniloan and Santa Maria occupied some territory of the Spanish-controlled town of Infanta as retaliation from Spanish raids on them.\n\nSituation as of August 10, 1754​\n\nInvasion of Tondo\n\nSince Pampanga could not use Bulacan as a road towards Tondo due to Bulaqueño policy of neutrality, Macapagal ordered naval forces to instead, land on Tondense soil. They landed on Pineda[13] at August 11, around noon. Simultaneously, the armies of Morong and Binangonan launched an official invasion of eastern Tondo that same day, while the armadahan vessels of Baras and Pilila initiated a blockade of the towns of Taguig and Muntinlupa. Tabuco joined in on the invasion, occupying Muntinlupa on August 14, as well as some barrios of the town of Silang[14] in the duchy of Cavite.\n\nAside from the invasion at Tondo proper, Macapagal, supported by Spanish authorities in Batangas, occupied the Kumintang coast on the 16th. They attempted a capture of Ternate on August 19 but was repulsed by Caviteño forces.\n\nBack in Tondo, Pancho his brother who was also a commander launched a defense on the east, successfully repulsing the principalities' attacks at Bosoboso and Taytay, although he could not expel them out due to lack of soldiers and equipment.\n\nA soldier in Taytay\n\n​\n\nHe then turned towards Tabuco in Muntinlupa, on August 24, where he, for the first time, was defeated in the battle of Muntinlupa. He then retreated to Taguig, where he was forced to hold out against a siege by the Tabuceños. Meanwhile, the Kapampangans marched from Pineda to Marikina, and from there, the enemy forces undertook a combined siege of the town capital that lasted a month.\n\nSoldiers of the Malabares of Pampanga, marching inward to Malibay[13]\n\nMestizos, and some insulares defending Marikina, September 4, 1754\n\nSituation at the time of Marikina siege\n\n​\n\nMagat decided to lift the siege, in which he marched from his base at Aromahan[15], arriving at Marikina on September 7. With superior knowledge of the terrain, and proper execution of logistics and tactics, he was able to lift the siege by blocking roads of supply and attacking its mostly fortified flanks. Afterwards, he charged at the main force, scattered his force into smaller ones, and simultaneously attacked. The combined enemy force liquidated and parted own ways. Tabuco retreated back to the town of San Pedro after the Muntinlupeños drove them away by bringing Pancho's refurbished troops. Meanwhile, the Kapampangans retreated back to Pineda. Magat chased down to forces of Binangonan and Morong, even occupying a portion of Morong and small parts of Binangonan.\n\nTo prevent another invasion, Magat garrisoned the entirety of eastern Tondo, which was laden with troops and bamboo towers.\n\nStalemate at Bataan and recapture of the Kumintang coast\n\nTo divert the main theater of war from Tondo proper, Magat decided to station the bulk of his forces to the frontlines in Bataan, where the Tondenses and Kapampangans were conducting minor skirmishes for the last days. He garrisoned over 900 troops between September 12 to September 20. However, even with this garrisoning, as well as of Macapagal's raids that dealt blows to the Tondenses, the frontlines remained in stalemate, with troops barely even conducting any movement, let alone small-scale raids and defense against raiding Negritos and bandits in the mountains.\n\nIn the Kumintang region however, the Tondenses, with the help of local partisans successfully expelled the Kapampangans on September 28. Nevertheless, the Kapampangans conducted raids along small villages in the coast. In response, Tondo sent its own navy and bombarded Macabebe[16], the main launching pad for the Kapampangan navy. This neutralized the Kapampangans for over two months, as most of the karakoas were heavily damaged by cannonfire.\n\nThe situation at Bataan remained the same from September up until November 10, where Macapagal, once again decided to leave the frontlines and retake Bataan once and for all. He marched down south, and met the Tondenses at Udyong[16], where they fortified the town and have already stationed themselves in various positions.\n\nA captain directing his troops on the direction on where to fire at, Udyong, November 11, 1754\n\n​\n\nThe captains defending the town ordered to fire at the Kapampangans ferociously, causing them to run low on artillery ammunition, but dealed great damage to the corps that Macapagal retreated back to Balanga. However, victory was short, as Macapagal returned with more men and drove out the Tondenses, causing only Mariveles to remain under Tondense hands. They then decided to guard Mariveles instead, while waiting the request for Magat to help them that was sent. Magat received the request on the afternoon of November 15, the same day the request was sent by boat. He prepared over 1,300 men and set sail for Balanga. He intended to trap Macapagal in Mariveles, in which his troops up north would block any reinforcements coming up from Hermosa.\n\nThey converged on the beleaguered Macapagal and his army, and as they converge even more, he was forced to retreat further and further until they have reached the mountainous interior. Seeing the mountain of Mariveles as his last line of defense, he decided to fortify him and his army there.\n\nThe siege lasted for over 2 months, until Macapagal decided to surrender on January 5, 1755.\n\nTreaty of Mount Mariveles and temporary peace with Pampanga\n\nThe treaty was signed at that same day, when Macapagal and Magat pledged to recognize and honor each state's jurisdiction. Macapagal signed the treaty since a possible invasion led by Andres IV (1719-1762) of Pangasinan is imminent. However, both also were very suspicious of each other on whether they would actually honor the terms of the treaty.\n\nWhile both sides made peace, Magat turned his attention to the town-states east of Tondo, which was becoming a thorn on Tondo's side since the beginning of the war. He appointed Pancho as the main commander of the east, while he heavily garrisoned Muntinlupa in the south to prevent Tabuco from sending troops again to wreak havoc. In the east, Pancho successfully neutralized the threat, and even occupied Binangonan starting on January 29.\n\nDuring this time, he also assisted Paco I of Cavite in his campaign against Tabuco. He also took the time to regain the strength of his army.\n\nAt this point, Silvestre decided to formally join the war, seeking to acquire some areas of Pampanga, particularly the old territories of the Calumpit alcaldia and some uninhabited areas claimed by Bacolor. He allowed the entry of over 2,700 Tondense troops, as well as 1,600 Bulaqueño soldiers, to prepare to bring the horrors of war in Pampanga.\n\nPampanga offensive\n\nThe war officially restarted on February 18, 1755 after nearly 2 months of temporary peace between Tondo and Pampanga.\n\nThe combined Tondense-Bulaqueño army initially entered the town of Apalit[17] on February 18, and quickly occupied the town. Next, they marched down to threaten Bacolor by initiating a siege of the capital by Feburary 27, after a period of subjugating the entirety of the duchies of Candaba and northern Macabebe east of the Pampanga river. Parts of the principality of Gapan was also occupied.\n\nMacapagal, who was at the northern town of Bamban[18], immediately galloped his way to Bacolor upon hearing the news of its siege. However when he got there, he was disappointed since the troops had largely dispersed and went on to occupy other parts of Pampanga according to rumors. In actuality, they only occupied Pampanga east of the Pampanga river excluding Bacolor, as well as the towns of Macabebe and Minalin. Tondo and Bulacan's purpose of the offensive is to occupy as much territory as possible, especially the areas that are highly productive in agriculture and industry, that would derive Pampanga of such important resources that would choke the state as a result.\n\nUndeterred, Macapagal tried to repel the foreign forces by retaking its towns one by one, day by day. At first, he was unsuccessful, but later gained ground as he launched his attacks with careful precision and boosted morale. Magat struggled to keep things afloat, but he immediately took back control of the situation after reorganizing his army.\n\nFor the rest of February and half of March, the situation was largely the same as in the previous one of Bataan, except some small skirmishes and raids, as well as a battle in barrio Telacsan in Apalit, However, the offensive fired its shots again when, Macapagal decided to engage the slowly retreating forces of Magat, in the town of Pinpin[19] on March 19. At first, he had the ground, but was later defeated by the combined armies 3 days later, that dealt great damage to both, although Pampanga has higher casualties of 1,100, compared to the two's only 500.\n\nAt last, both sides finally agreed that a second peace treaty shall be made, on the month of April.\n\nTreaty of Paombong\n\nBoth armies met at Paombong, on April 9. Present there was also Pancho and the gobernadorcillos of Binangonan, Baras, Pilila and Morong, as well as Paco and the gobernadorcillos of Santa Maria, Mabitac and Siniloan.\n\nPancho had a say in the treaty, since the gobernadorcillos of the latter states launched another invasion, that resulted in complete failure. He encouraged that as a punishment for this, as well as countless raids into Tondense territory, the towns shall be annexed to Tondo. Most of them disagreed with this, however Magat ensured that the all officials that comprise of the local administration shall remain in their positions as long as they pledge allegiance to Tondo. In the treaty, the barrio of Nanhaya[20] in Pila shall also be annexed, as well as the termination of the 1687 treaty by Magat II Sancho. The easternmost portion of the duchy of Candaba was ceded to Bulacan.\n\nPampanga was also to pay Tondo and Bulacan 125,000 pesos each year for its 5 year duration, which was another reason for anti-Tagalism to increase in Pampanga.\n\nTreaty of Paombong​\n\n[1] - Included Naic until 1791, Ternate until 1857 (annexed to Naic in 1904 and separated in 1915?), Bailen until 1858 (G.
