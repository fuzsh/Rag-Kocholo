This might not be the best methodology as it might not be reflective on an actual bite force during real natural activity.\n\nWhat is PSI (Pressure Per Square Inch) for Dogs?\n\nA PSI for a dog bite simply refers to the unit pounds per square inch. This technically doesn’t record force but pressure. Depending on who you ask, this is the more important measurement. It calculates the maximum pressure at any one pound.
