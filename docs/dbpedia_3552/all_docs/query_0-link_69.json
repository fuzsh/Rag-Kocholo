        "text": "Introduction\n\nRecently, I came across the Heneral Luna Study Guide, which is an interesting effort to engage teachers.\n\nI am sharing a timeline I have compiled of key events and accompanying literature on the life of Antonio Luna. Some of the items in the timeline came from The World of 1898: The Spanish-American War. The purpose of the timeline is to add additional readings, from the perspective of friends, critics (and enemies) and historians, on Luna and his times.\n\nEvents and trends placing events in Luna’s life in context are in italics.\n\nSee also Part I, Part II, and Part III of a Graphic Timeline of the Philippine-American War, from the Presidential Museum and Library. See also The Philippine-American War.\n\n1866\n\nOctober 29\n\nAntonio Luna is born.\n\nEdwin Francisco, UP Science and Society Program:\n\nAntonio Luna de San Pedro y Novicio-Ancheta was born on October 29, 1866 in Urbiztondo, Binondo, Manila. He was the youngest of seven children of Joaquín Luna de San Pedro, from Badoc, Ilocos Norte, and Spanish mestiza Laureana Novicio-Ancheta, from Luna, La Union (formerly Namacpacan).[3] His father was a traveling salesman of the products of government monopolies. His older brother, Juan, was an accomplished painter who studied in the Madrid Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Another brother, José, became a doctor.\n\n1872\n\nJanuary 20\n\nCavite Mutiny.\n\n1881\n\nBachelor of Arts, Ateneo Municipal de Manila. Studied two years at the University of Santo Tomas, earning first prize for the paper, Two Fundamental Bodies of Chemistry.\n\n1884\n\nMay\n\nIn The Roots of the Filipino Nation, O.D. Corpuz writes:\n\nThe reports during the period also refer to an incident that occurred in Pangasinan in May 1884. The official story was that the pueblo officials of Santa Maria, Binalonan, and Urdaneta conspired to lead a group of bandits to sack one of the towns, and that the disturbance was speedily quelled.\n\nIf Buencamino’s testimony is correct, the investigation and trial were “rigged.” He claims that the alleged insurrection was simulated by the Dominican friars. They sent out incriminating letters to Filipinos in places as far apart as northern Luzon to Tarlac, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija, the letters bearing Novicio’s name. For good measure they “warned” the civil government of the supposed insurrection. In other words, it was a frame-up.[1]\n\n1885\n\nMaternal uncle of Antonio Luna implicated in revolt. As Raquel A. G. Reyes wrote in Love, Passion and Patriotism: Sexuality and the Philippine Propaganda,\n\nThe family of Juan and Antonio Luna fell under suspicion after their maternal uncle had led a short-lived uprising against Spanish rule in the provinces of Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija, and the 19-year-old Antonio had been briefly incarcerated in Manila’s Bilibid prison.[21]\n\n1888\n\nLuna goes to Spain. The exceptional abilities of the two brothers was recognized even by their enemies. Here is an extract from a truly scurrilous book, written from the perspective of the Spanish religious orders.\n\nIn The Katipunan, Francis St. Claire wrote:\n\nNOTE 10. Antonio and Juan Luna were two of four brothers. The former was a bacteriologist, the latter an artist who at one time, whilst he followed the instruction and remained under the guidance of his master, showed no little talent. Antonio went to Spain in ‘88, and later on passed to Paris where he lived with his brother Juan who supported him. There he devoted himself to the study which made him famous; this he did in the laboratory of Dr. Roux. He became an assistant editor of the Solidaridad, the official organ of filipino freemasonry, and wrote many vicious articles in its columns over the pseudonym of Taga-Ilog. As a member of the freemason fraternity, he was known as Gay Lussac.\n\nOn his return to Manila he established for a livelihood a school of fencing, and like the vain, insensate “magpie in borrowed plumes” that he was, he once sent his seconds to a Spanish officer, inviting him to a duel![6]\n\nOctober 16\n\nAntonio Luna writes to Mariano Ponce. This letter would be used as an exhibit in Rizal’s trial in December, 1896:\n\nMadrid, October 16, 1888, to D. Mariano Ponce.\n\nMy dear friend Mariano:\n\n–Rizal has very well said of Lete that he does not serve for big enterprises. Consult with him concerning the designation of Llorente as director of the paper. Rizal knows them both; he also knows Llorente’s capacity and is very intimate with him, because both are young men of sterling value and Rizal has a very good opinion of Llorente. Ask him for advice and heed well what he tells you. Tell him that I have induced Llorente to accept the position of director.\n\n–An embrace, and take the matter to Rizal for his advice.\n\nThine, Antonio.\n\n–P. S. Tear this letter up after noting its contents. Send me immediately Rizal’s London address.[23]\n\n1889\n\nFrom the memoirs of Luna’s good friend, Jose Alejandrino:\n\nIn that year (1889) there appeared in the newspaper “El Pueblo Soberano” of Barcelona certain articles signed by its editor and owner, Mir Deas, lambasting “Taga-Ilog” for his criticisms of the Spanish customs expounded in his book “Impressions”, which articles Antonio Luna was answering from Madrid. The controversy reached a point, if I remember well, where the editor of “El Pueblo Soberano” included all the Filipino people in his attacks.\n\nThis Mr. Mir Deas, whose name Luna changed to Mier Das (Spanish for excreta), was one who had resided for a long time in the Philippines, writing in the local papers. Protected by the immunity afforded them by the state of things at that time, he and Barrantes, Quioquiap, Retana and others took pleasure in reviling continuously the entire Filipino people in their writings.\n\n—\n\nLuna needed very little to arouse his anger and this time he had more than enough reason to get really mad; consequently, he wanted at all cost to avenge the offense done to him and all those of his race. He therefore insulted even us for refusing to point out Mir Deas to him.\n\n—\n\nUpon Mir’s refusal to accept a duel, Luna became more furious, and we resolved not to leave him alone when walking in the city. I slept in the same room with him, and I was careful to keep him company at all times. One morning, however, I woke up greatly startled upon seeing the bed of Luna vacated so early. I looked for him in all parts of the house and, not finding him, I dressed up in a hurry and proceeded to the Rambla de las Flores (a promenade in the city) where I was almost sure I would find him. There indeed he was, walking alone up and down the Rambla de las Flores and the Rambla de los Pajaros brandishing a rattan cane with that ferocious face which he used to wear when in bad humor and which face earned for himself among his intimates the nickname “cafre”. Upon seeing him I asked him, ”What are you doing here, Antonio?”\n\nAnd he answered, “ I am looking for Mir Deas.” I asked him again, “How do you expect to find him when you do not know him?”\n\nTo this he replied, “Well, I am looking for anyone who to me looks like Mir Deas to mangle down.”\n\nI tried to calm him down, advising him to have a little more patience because soon we would indicate Mir to him, and he would have occasion to punish him properly.\n\nMir Deas refused absolutely either to make the demanded retraction or to fight, and, finally, the seconds, despairing that Mir would not give satisfaction for the offense which he had caused us, decided to tell Luna who he was, taking him to the Cafe de los Cristales on Plaza Cataluña where he was found writing on one of the tables. From the door of the Cafe they indicated to Luna where Mir was and Luna, without committing himself to the protection of either God or the devil, went toward the offender, spitting on his face. But not even this insult which was done publicly made Mir fight; instead, he wrote another insulting article in the newspaper “El Diluvio” (The Deluge). Luna and ex-Secretary Apacible sent their seconds to the editor of the paper and the author of the article, but both refused to accept the challenge on the pretext that they were not agreeable to the principles of the duel. One of the seconds sent was Mariano Ponce.\n\nLater on, for the satisfaction of the Spaniards who sympathized with our aspirations, the Filipino colony in Barcelona submitted the writings of Luna to a jury composed entirely of Spaniards, among whom was Señor Junoy — editor of “La Publicidad” of Barcelona who later on occupied a prominent place in Spanish politics. This jury decided that the writings of Luna were not insulting to the Spaniards as a people but were solely a criticism of some customs which many Spanish writers themselves had also criticized.[2]\n\nContext for the above can be found in The Roots of the Filipino Nation, in which O.D. Corpuz writes:\n\nAntonio Luna was involved in an “affair of honor” in 1889. It started with his article “Impresiones Madrileñas de un Filipino” (La Solidaridad 31 October). The piece began with him fantasizing about Spain the mother country, Madrid its capital, and then the Puerta del Sol, the latter’s magnificent hub and main plaza, when he was on board ship in the China Sea on the voyage to Europe. In Madrid Luna’s Malay features were conspicuous; the people called him “Chino” or “Igorot” – there had been some Igorots brought for exhibition in the 1887 exposition. In the main his impressions of the city expressed disappointment; but if the piece was critical, it was not much different nor more severe than criticisms of the city by Spanish writers. Luna warned Filipinos against being disenchanted. In his closing paragraph he advised readers that “his pictures were realistic” and that he did not use “shadings and medium tints.” He signed as Taga-ilog.\n\n[…]\n\nThis supplement ended with an Epilogue: how Mariano Ponce was secretly denounced to the authorities as allegedly publishing clandestine books. Rumors and talk of sedition spread in the city and were published in the press, but an official investigation established that the denunciations were groundless.[1]\n\n1889-1890\n\nThe editorial ins and outs, and relationship between the writers of La Solidaridad is summarized by O.D. Corpuz as follows:\n\nHe had sent a letter with this suggestion to Del Pilar in June 1889. He informed the latter that Antonio Luna was ready with a series of articles for the SOL; Luna would not use any pseudonyms.\n\nLet us abandon pseudonyms and adopt a new policy, the policy of valor and true solidarity. The paper is becoming important; imagine if the articles are signed by Blumentritt, M. del Pilar, Jaena, Luna, etc. Our countrymen, upon seeing our courage, upon seeing not the courage of one but of many, on seeing that Rizal is not an exception but the general rule, will take courage and lose their fear.\n\n[…]\n\nThe exiles generally wrote to each other in Spanish; Rizal had to use German with Blumentritt and sometimes Tagalog with Ponce and Del Pilar. In 1890 Antonio Luna, Alejandrino, and Edilberto Evangelista were studying at the University of Ghent; they occasionally corresponded with Rizal in French. The two Lunas were fencing aficionados. Antonio became a staff writer of La Solidaridad. He wrote under the pen name “Tagailog.” His pieces tended to be fiction, nostalgic themes characteristic of the love-struck Filipino swain such as kissing in Filipinas, affairs of love, his lady teacher in the pueblo, and so on. For a time in 1891 he was producing the paper almost single-handedly. He was back in Filipinas by 1892 but did not join the Katipunan because he thought that it was premature; he was tricked later on by the friars into betraying some of his old colleagues. He was arrested and sent to prison in Spain. He returned in July 1898 to join the Revolution and became the most admired but controversial general during the second phase of the Revolution and Filipino-American War.\n\n[…]\n\nA. Luna was rather more cosmopolitan than the other Filipinos in Madrid. His brother Juan lived in Paris, so that he spent some time in the French capital, and he was the principal staff writer on the 1889 universal exposition in Paris as well as on the political status of colonies in the French system. He also wrote lead articles and political pieces every now and then. He contributed many pieces for the “Arts and Letters” section.\n\n[…]\n\nBy September the SOL was in shambles. Antonio Luna wrote Rizal about the plight of the staff: “the recompense for our labors is the ruin of our future; we are easily made to serve as a facade so that others plunder behind the screen – in short, the exploitation of man by man.” He hints darkly at financial irregularities. Where does the money that is said to have come from Manila go? “There are grand mismanagement, unnecessary trips, total unconcern; initiative is gone; the campaign is dead. This is total suicide.” The work is passed on to him: “Today I have had to write four articles because neither Del Pilar nor Naning does absolutely anything.” The management of the SOL is absolutist; “it is worse than that of the State.” Luna is bitter and tells Rizal that he is about to leave the SOL.\n\nLuna’s hints on financial irregularities in the SOL appear to have been confirmed in November. Moises Salvador wrote that some 700 pesos in the custody of the editor were to be turned over to Rizal. The turn over of the money was agreed to by the old Manila committee upon petition of the fund donors. But the turnover could not be effected; Salvador was disgusted; he cited obstructions raised; he decried these as unspeakable, referring to them as “events that have no name.” [1]\n\nRizal challenges Luna to a duel.\n\n1892\n\nSee my North Borneo (Sabah): An annotated timeline 1640s-present. In Under Three Flags, Benedict Anderson writes:\n\nRizal’s first plan for resolving, or evading, these contradictory pressures was to form a settlement for his family and like-minded friends on the bay of Sandakan in what is today the east Malaysian federal state of Sabah. Geographically, it was as close to the Philippines as one could get—250 miles from Jolo, seat of the once-powerful Muslim sultanate of Sulu, still restive under loose Spanish overlordship, and a little over 600 miles from Manila. The same distances separated Havana from Miami, and from Tampa, where Marti was recruiting revolutionaries among the Cuban tobacco-worker communities. Politically, too, it could seem promising. The northern littoral of Borneo was, in the 1890s, a very peculiar Conradian place. On the western portion lay the kingdom of the so-called White Rajahs, founded by the English adventurer James Brooke in the 1840s, and under London’s hands-off protection from the 1880s. The residues of the once-powerful sultanate of Brunei occupied a small niche in the middle, while the eastern portion, including Sandakan, was governed after 1882 by a private business, the British North Borneo Chartered Company. Better still, in 1885 the Spanish had been induced to abandon any quasi-legal claims to the territory deriving from the shifting suzerainty of Jolo. Hence, while Hong Kong was under the suspicious eyes of the Spanish consul and the Catholic Orders’ local branches, Sandakan was free of both. It is not surprising, therefore, that some of Rizal’s more fiery comrades in Europe, such as Evangelista and Antonio Luna, dreaming of Marti’s Florida, were enthusiastic about the planned settlement. Some time in January 1892, Luna wrote to Rizal in Hong Kong that “Borneo sera un Cayo Hueso para nosotros, y muy probable sea yo tambien uno de sus habitantes, si las circunstancias me obligan” [Borneo will be for us a Cayo Hueso (Bone Reef, phonetically garbled by the Americans into Key West), and it is very probable that I will become one of its denizens, if circumstances make it necessary].[1] On the other hand, Sandakan also promised an unbadgered life for Rizal’s family, and for the novelist himself, his library and his writing.[2] He also hoped that many of the dispossessed people in his hometown Calamba would also join him in this Bornean sanctuary.[3]\n\nAt the end of March, Rizal made the first of several visits to North Borneo after preliminary negotiations with the British North Borneo Charter Company’s representative in Hong Kong. Initially, the prospects seemed quite rosy. Rizal was offered 5,000 acres of uncultivated land rent-free for three years, with the possibility of eventual purchase at a low price. The British North Borneo Charter Company, eager for settlement in a very sparsely populated region, further accepted that the Filipino community would be run by its own members according to their own customs, and be subject neither to corvee nor to unreasonable taxes. But within a few months the whole project started to collapse. Rizal began to realize that he could not raise anything close to the money needed to get the little colony going. Furthermore, populating it would require the agreement of the Spanish to a substantial migration. Rizal wrote to the new Captain-General explaining that he wished to settle down quietly with family and townspeople, but Despujol was not persuaded. An emigration on this scale would put his government in a bad light; besides, the conservative press in Spain would be likely to view it as the start of a Bornean Tampa just out of Manila’s political and military reach.[4]\n\nRizal’s alternative, more alarming for his family, was to create the first legal political organization for Filipinos in the Philippines itself. What this plan amounted to is difficult to determine. No document in Rizal’s own hand survives. Virtually all the written evidence, often contradictory, comes from testimony given to, or extracted by, police interrogators and torturers…\n\nThe same book contains this interesting exchange of letters:\n\n[1]Cartas entre Rizal y sus colegas, pp. 771-2. The whole letter is of great interest, since Luna was highly intelligent. He told Rizal he was heading back to Manila to work for independence. “Para todo eso sera preciso mucho studio, mucho tacto, prudencia y nada de alardes de ser fuertes… Con constancia y silencio seremos unos jesuitas para plantar una casa donde pongamos un clavo. Ofrezco, pues, en este sentido mi concurso, pero con la sola condicion de que podre desligarme de la campan?a active si viera que sera solo un motin… Creo que me comprendes bien, si nos vencen que cueste mucha sangre. Ire, pues, a Manila y en todos mis actos tendre siempre presente mi deber de separatist. Nada de desconfianzas, si las circunstancias me colocan al lado de los espan?oles en Manila, peor para ellos: me ganare la vida e ire minando el suelo a costa de ellos hasta que la fruta este madura, Teneis ya, pues (si non vuestras ideas estas), un satellite por aqui que trabajara con constancia.” [But this will require much study, much tact, prudence, and no empty boasting about our strength… With constancy and silence we will be like Jesuits, etting up a house for which we have a key. So, in this sense, I am offering you my assistance, but with the single condition that I can disengage from the active campaign if I see that it will be nothing more than a mutiny… I believe you understand me well, that if they win, it will cost much bloodshed. In any case, I am leaving for Manila, and in all my actions my duty as a separatist will always be before my eyes. No suspicions: if circumstances place me at the side of the Spaniards in Manila, so much the worse for them. I will earn my living and continue mining the land to their cost, until the fruit is ripe. You will have, then (if these ideas are also yours), a satellite on the spot who will work with constancy.]\n\n[2] Touchingly, Rizal wrote thus to Blumentritt on January 31, 1892: “Wahrend ich aus meine Amtspflichten ausruhe, schreibe ich den driten Theil meines Buches auch in Tagalisch. Es wird sich nur um Heimlich tagalischen Sitten die Rede sein, nur um tagalischen Ubungen, Tubungen, und Fehler. Leider dass ich es nicht auf Spanisch schreiben darf, den ich habe einen sehr schonen Gegenstand im kopfe gefunden; ich will einen Roman nach den modernen Sinne des Wortes erdichten, kunstlich und litterarisch. Diesmal will ich die Politik und alles den Kunst aufopfern; schriebe ich es auf Spanisch, so warden die armen Tagalen, denen es gewidmet, nichts davon wissen und doch die haben es am moisten nothing… Doch est kostet mir viele Muhe den viele von meinen Gedenken konnen sich nicht frei ausdrucken, sonst muss ich neologismes einfuhren; ausserdem mir fe[h]t die Ubung in Tagalisch zu schreiben.” [While resting from my professional labors (as a doctor), I am writing the third part of my book in Tagalog. It will deal solely with Tagalog customs, [i.e.] exclusively with the habits, virtues and defects of the Tagalogs. I feel I cannot write the book in Spanish now that I have found a beautiful theme; I want to write a novel in the modern sense of the word, an artistic and literary novel. This time I would like to sacrifice politics and the rest for the sake of art; if I write in Spanish, then the poor Tagalogs, to whom the work is dedicated, will not understand it, even though it is they who most need to do so… The book is giving me a lot of trouble, as many of my thoughts cannot be freely expressed without the need to introduce neologisms. Besides, I lack practice in writing Tagalog.] The Rizal-Blumentritt Correspondence, 1890-1896, unnumbered pages from p. 431. This third novel was never finished. What little there is of it has been carefully reconstructed by Ambeth Ocampo in his The Search for Rizal’s Third Novel, Makamisa (Manila: Anvil, 1993). Rizal gave up writing it in Tagalog after twenty manuscript pages, and reverted to Spanish. Makamisa means “After Mass,” and the text, focused on the townspeople of Pili and their Peninsular parish priest, returns to the satirical costumbrista style of Noli me tangere. Perhaps this is why he gave up on it, or maybe he concluded that he could not go beyond El Filibusterismo. In any event, after mid-1892 he seems to have abandoned any idea of further novel-writing.\n\n[3] It will be recalled that it was Rizal who had strongly urged the tenants and townspeople of Calamba to take the Dominicans to court, and pushed the case right up to the Supreme Court in Madrid. As already noted, when the vengeful Order won the case, and Weyler, in addition to burning houses, forbade the recalcitrants to reside anywhere near Calamba, Rizal was devastated and felt enormously guilty for the suffering he had brought on his hometown.\n\n[4] The comparison between Sandakan and Tampa is, in one sense, unwarranted. The British had no designs on the Philippines, whereas powerful groups in the United States had had their avaricious eyes on Cuba for some time. But the contrast may have seemed less obvious in the 1890s than it does today. It is hard to imagine Antonio Luna and Edilberto Evangelista promising from Europe to join Rizal in: Sandakan if they expected no more from it than a chance to grow vegetables and read some books.[3]\n\nFrom Vivencio Jose’s The Rise and Fall of Antonio Luna, this declaration by Luna:\n\n“The propaganda for assimilation is necessary but more active should the separatist propaganda be, because we shall not obtain the first (i.e. assimilation) and even if we did (which is almost impossible) we would be worse off than ever; the practical thing is to seek adherents in order to shake off the yoke of Spain. I want to make clear therefore, what is in my mind: that we must work for independence, organizing ourselves, converting ourselves into apostles in order to gain men and money. For all this much study is necessary, a great deal of tact, prudence and no boasting of our strength… I offer therefore my services, in this sense, but with the sole condition that I shall be allowed to disengage myself from the active campaign if I see it will only be an armed riot. It is not that I dream of success, rather I dream of a resistance for which you understand me well enough; if they triumph over us let it be at the cost of much blood. I shall go then to Manila and in all my acts always keep in mind my duty as a separatist.”[4]\n\nRizal, in his essay, “The Philippines a Century Hence”:\n\nAll the petty insurrections that have occurred in the Philippines were the work of a few fanatics or discontented soldiers, who had to deceive and humbug the people or avail themselves of their powers over their subordinates to gain their ends. So they all failed. No insurrection had a popular character, or was based on a need of the whole race, or was fought for human rights or justice; so it left no ineffaceable impressions … when they saw that they had been duped, the people bound up their wounds and applauded the overthrow of the disturbers of their peace! But what if the movement springs from the people themselves and based its causes upon their woes?[5]\n\nIn The Rise and Fall of Antonio Luna, Vivencio Jose writes the view of the Spanish religious orders:\n\nNOTE 70. The idea that the Liga was but an introduction to the Katipunan is not borne out by the facts of the case. The Liga Filipina was a foundation of Rizal, whilst the Katipunan was a conception of Pilar who, finding Rizal was carrying all before him, determined not to be outdone by his former companion. The very fact of the enmity existing between the two leaders is proof enough that the two societies were not one and the same thing, although after their foundation they walked arm in arm. The Liga, as an association, was eventually dissolved, and from it was formed the Compromisarios (see Note 63) and this body continued its functions till the outbreak of the revolt. The vicissitudes of the Liga did not lessen Rizal’s influence. Ever ready to tell a lie or act one if it were to his own advantage, Rizal permitted the free use of his name in connection with the Katipunan also. To the vast majority of the oath- bound, the Katipunan was but the Liga under another form; and in order that the people should not know of the rivalry existing between himself and Pilar, Rizal gave no signs of disfavor towards the foundation of the new society; in fact he rather favored it, seeing that under the circumstances it would make him figure as its “hero” and he would thus be enabled to take the wind out of Pilar’s sails. The only objection raised by Rizal to the work of the Katipunan was that which he made to Valenzuela: that the time had not yet come for armed rebellion.[6]\n\nIn The Roots of the Filipino Nation, O.D. Corpuz writes,\n\nRizal regarded the Revolution in its wholeness. A revolution would entail a contest of arms that, if successful, wins national liberty. But fighting is only part of the revolution; the other part is the building of civic structures to establish the justice that the people had fought for. To Rizal the Filipino Revolution was a struggle to win both liberty for the nation and, after victory, to ensure that the masses who fought in battle are governed by civil institutions that promise a just and lawful society.\n\nThere is an old Filipino saying: “Someone does the cooking, but somebody else does the eating.” Rizal’s view of the Filipino Revolution was that it was to be a struggle of national regeneration and not merely a transfer of political power from one dominant class to another dominant class. If his manifesto were to be taken at face value it must be read as saying that the Revolution was premature because it was at best uncertain whether the common people, who would do the fighting, would be the beneficiaries of the liberty that victory would yield. But it would be against the evidence of Rizal’s life and writings, and of the admiration and respect in which he was held by the Filipinos of his time, to say that he was against the Revolution, because he was a defender of “upper class interests.”\n\n[…]\n\nWe have suggested that the exodus of the young Filipinos and their waging of the Propaganda abroad indirectly delayed the outbreak of the Revolution at home. Had Lopez Jaena, Arejola, Ponce, Alejandrino, Evangelista, Serrano, the Lunas, Salvador, Ventura, Llorente, Bautista, Apacible, Canon, Sandico, Del Pilar, Rizal, and others among the exiles stayed home during the 1880s, or come home earlier, say by 1890, the inevitable fight with the friars would have ruptured the fragile peace long before 1896.\n\nIn addition to the evidence already shown, that some of the important men of the Propaganda abandoned reformism, note must be taken of those who came home and became prominent in the Hongkong Junta, the Revolution, and the FilipinoAmerican War. Sandico and Apacible were “hawks” when Aguinaldo and the Junta were exploring the probable relations with the United States in early May 1898. Mariano Ponce served as Aguinaldo’s secretary in Hongkong. Canon, Evangelista, Sandico, Alejandrino, Llorente, and of course Luna, became generals in the Revolution. Numerous others served in the Malolos Congress and Republic. [7]\n\n1893\n\nDoctorate in Pharmacy from the Universidad Central of Madrid. See: El hematozoario del paludismo su estudio experimental por Antonio Luna y Novicio.\n\nPer Benjamin Vallejo Jr., Antonio Luna’s research on malaria:\n\nHe did his doctoral research on the forms of the malaria parasite in human blood. Now we call these as merozoites but in Luna’s day doctors called these as hematozoites. Luna’s thesis “El Hematozoario del Paludismo” focused on describing the differentiation of these merozoites into different morphological forms (Luna’s own drawings of these are shown above) and related these to malaria’s trademark symptoms, the chills, enlargement of the spleen and liver and periodic high fevers. Luna tried to find out what forms of the parasites caused these symptoms and to know when to best administer the only known drug at the time, quinine from the Chinchona tree.\n\nLuna had to test, improve and develop diagnostic techniques some of which medical technologists and pathologists still use to diagnose malaria today. However he was also interested to culture the parasite in vitro and tried to develop a technique to observe the merozoite cellular differentiation outside the host. However in 1892-1893 the technology did not exist. Luna failed in the attempt. It was only in 1976 was it possible to have in vitro culture of the malaria parasite. And so it became possible to test effective drugs such as Dr Tu’s Artemisin.\n\nThe reason why Luna wanted to culture the parasite is to test Robert Koch’s postulate that by inoculation of the parasite to an uninfected host, the disease will be observed and doctors would know how a drug can disrupt the parasite’s biochemistry, thus leading to an effective cure. At this time, doctors just suspected that mosquitoes were the vectors for malaria transmission. But based on the parasite studies of Luna and other scientists, it became possible to test this hypothesis. In 1898, Dr Grassi one of the scientists Luna cited in his thesis, was able to experimentally demonstrate that it was the Anopheles mosquito that was responsible for infecting humans. Humankind thus had the first effective strategies for eradicating malaria.\n\nMore from Benjamin Vallejo Jr.:\n\nLuna obtained a “…doctorate in pharmacy in 1893 with a doctoral thesis on the differentiation of hematozoites of malaria which proved to be extremely useful in diagnosis. This still saves lives today especially in Africa. He is the first Pinoy pensionado of the colonial government to have earned a science doctorate.”\n\nAmbeth Ocampo, August 2, 2012:\n\n..The box also contained Luna’s school notebooks, including those with drawings of things he saw under a microscope. It is not well-known that before he was appointed a general during the Filipino-American War, he had taken postgraduate courses at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. He had made a name for himself in Manila for his studies on the purity of carabao milk and water from the Pasig, as well as a study on mosquitoes and the spread of disease.\n\n1894\n\nIn The Rise and Fall of Antonio Luna, Vivencio Jose writes:\n\nAt the time of the organization of the popular Supreme Councils, Bonifacio was chosen president of the Council of Trozo; but in consequence of internal troubles occasioned by his rebelliousness, the Supreme Council decided to dissolve the local Council. Bonifacio, true to his colors, disregarded this order and continued working on his own account, taking upon himself the faculties of the Supreme Council.\n\nHe preserved in a case which was found in the warehouse of Messrs. Fressel and Co. the organization of the “Filipino Republic” which was to be, as well as a number of regulations, codes, decrees of nominations, etc., all drawn up in Tagalog.[6]\n\n1895\n\nJose Alejandrino recalled:\n\nOn my return in 1895, we renewed our intimate friendly relations, which relations Mamerto Natividad and Moises Salvador took advantage of by requesting me to transmit to him Rizal’s advice that Luna be asked to join the K.K.K. as an intermediary between the rich and educated class and the proletariat which constituted the great majority of the members of the Katipunan. Luna refused to join the movement, alleging that it was yet premature.[8]\n\nMarch 20\n\nLETTER TO DEL PILAR[9]\n\nManila, March 20, 1895\n\nMARCELO H. DEL PILAR\n\nMy very dear Friend:\n\nEnclosed is the letter in answer to your proposition to help “El Globo” so that you can show it to Don Miguel;[1] also enclosed is a bill of exchange in the amount of $100.\n\nThe reasons stated in the letter are only too true, and not invented. And they are so true that neither Ariston[2] nor anyone of us dares talk to Don Pedro Roxas, and much less to Limjap.\n\nWith respect to the bill of exchange, we haven’t yet been able to increase our remittance, despite all our efforts, as we are well aware that the $100 monthly is not enough to cover the pressing needs of the delegation.\n\nWe deeply regret our inability to give neither a long and detailed description of the Regional Exposition nor only a light sketch of it because nobody is in charge of this work. In the first place, none of our friends is used to this kind of work and, secondly, more or less each has his own tasks. You can cite me as an example. Even if I make a great effort, the work may still turn out badly, and my health may become the worse for it, because I shall have to study hard to be able to give a story of the Exposition.\n\nLuna (Antonio) does not like to take charge of the work unless we give him a monthly remuneration of thirty pesos, something which we cannot promise him lest we cannot keep the promise. In truth, there are four kittens of us moving around here, which cannot do anything without help from others.\n\nDespite the pessimism reflected in the previous lines, we still retain, the hope we had of the first days, firmly believing that without struggling it is not possible to mould real men. Besides, we try our best to show how we manage the funds in the hope that, sooner or later, our friends will understand that honesty still exists.\n\nAnd, please do not think that the obstacles I have stated reflect on you, no. On the day we come to understand it that way, we shall be the first to let you know without beating around the bush, because then, our campaign would have become indefensible. I am just saying this to you because on similar occasions you seemed to have read in my words a meaning that was far from what I intended to give them.\n\nReceive the embrace of all and, in particular, of your affectionate\n\nMABINI\n\n[1] Don Miguel Morayta.\n\n[2] Ariston Bautista.\n\n1896:\n\nJuly\n\nIn A New History Of Southeast Asia, M.C. Ricklefs,Bruce Lockhart, Bruce, and Albert Lau wrote:\n\nThe Katipunan ballooned from 15,000 to 30,000. In July 1896, however, the organization was betrayed to a priest in confession. The authorities thereupon raided a printing shop where they found printing blocks for the Kalayaan, other paraphernalia, and a list of members. The Guardia Civil then arrested suspects, who were forced to identify other members.[11]\n\nIn The Emergence Of Modern Southeast Asia- A New History, Norman Owen writes:\n\nBonifacio sought unsuccessfully to attract ilustrados, including Apolinario Mabini, Antonio Luna, and, most important, Rizal himself, to his Katipunan. He then decided to implicate them through forgery, hoping that Spanish repression would achieve his goals. He succeeded. A friar, discovering the revolutionary plot — supposedly during confessional, though this seems unlikely — reported it to Spanish authorities, who moved to arrest the conspirators. As the police swept across the city searching for Katipunan members. Bonifacio and his supporters fled to a Manila suburb where he issued a call to open rebellion, known today as the “cry of Balintawak,” and they tore up their hated cedulas (identity papers).\n\nSpanish heavy-handedness accomplished Bonifacio’s goal. Rizal was brought back to Manila and tried for treason, because the Spanish believed he was “the principal organizer and the very soul of the Philippine insurrection.” Rizal, who considered the Katipunan plan “disastrous,” was convicted after a sham trial and publicly executed. Many years earlier, Rizal had written, “The day on which the Spanish inflict martyrdom on our innocent families for our fault, farewell, pro-friar government, and perhaps, farewell. Spanish Government.” Rizal’s execution forged an alliance, albeit fragile, between the ilustrados and Bonifacio’s rebels. Hatred of the Spanish unified many Filipinos of every social class. Some years before Rizal had noted: “A numerous, educated class, both in the archipelago and outside it, must now be reckoned with… It is in continuous contact with the rest of the population. And if it is no more today than the brains of the nation, it will become in a few years its whole nervous system. Then we shall see what it will do.”\n\nIn his prison cell Rizal wrote a “Manifesto to Certain Filipinos,” reiterating that the education of the people was a prerequisite to liberty. Noting that without education and “civic virtues,” Filipinos would not find “redemption,” he stressed that reforms, if they were to bear fruit, would have to “come from above,” because reforms from below would be “violent and transitory.” In spite of this cautionary’ note and his professions of loyalty to a Spain that he still hoped might govern justly, he was shot on 30 December 1896, ensuring the very revolution he had hoped to avoid.”[12]\n\nIn John Schumacher’s, review of Vivencio Jose’s The Rise and Fall of Antonio Luna, he writes:\n\nThough this book was apparently written before the publication of my Propaganda Movement, its failure to situate Luna within the organized nationalist activity of the Filipino activists in Europe makes Luna’s activities during this period seem rather unconnected and gives little idea of the progressive evolution of his thought. Nonetheless, Jose does make clear that, contrary to the efforts of some historians to portray the Propaganda Movement as merely a reformist, assimilationist movement, there was a radical separatist group, including Luna, Rizal, Edilberto Evangelista, Jose Alejandrino, and others not alluded to here. Whatever they may have been forced to say publicly, some of the Propagandists had already resolved, at least by the early 1890s, on definitive separation from Spain. What is not explored here, however, is how early Luna set himself on such a course, and how he related his ideas to the differing strategies of Rizal and Del Pilar, both of them likewise aiming at ultimate separation from Spain. This failure to explore the nuances of the Luna-Rizal separatist approach vitiates to a great extent the discussion on Luna’s relation to Bonifacio’s Katipunan and the Revolution of 1896. To attribute Luna’s refusal to support the premature revolt by Bonifacio to his ‘middle class thoughts’ or to the typical attitude of ‘the wealthy Filipinos’ is to ignore how correct Luna was when he rejected, not the Revolution, but an unprepared and insufficiently armed revolution, which could only eventuate in military disaster, as Bonifacio’s total military failure rapidly showed. The criticism of Luna for refusing to support the ill-prepared revolt of Bonifacio seems inconsistent with Jose’s later (and to this reviewer, more correct) praise of Luna for his strenuous and often-frustrated efforts to organize a disciplined army, operating according to careful plans and making use of military science and discipline, instead of Aguinaldo’s haphazard collection of ‘clan armies’ based on personal local and provincial loyalties and wishing to fight “with bared breasts” rather than prepare trenches and breastworks…”[13]\n\nIn The Roots of the Filipino Nation, O.D. Corpuz writes,\n\nThere is additional material about the Katipunan having been exposed or discovered before August 1896. Jose Alejandrino, back home from Europe in 1895, says that Moises Salvador and Mamerto Natividad asked him to get Antonio Luna to join the society. This was in accordance with a suggestion of Rizal to Valenzuela. But Luna believed that the revolutionary movement was premature. Even so, he was among those arrested and interrogated in the round-up after the uprising. Luna made a statement dated 12 November 1896 wherein he said that on 18 or 20 July he had told his supervisor in the government laboratory (Luna was a pharmacist-chemist) that there were secret societies organized to rise against the regime, “so that he could report it to the Governor-General.” The latter summoned him “on the 2nd or 3rd August” and he repeated what he had told his supervisor, adding that the rich and prominent classes did not join the societies, which were plebeian. Luna’s testimony confirmed what the governor-general had known for months.\n\n[…]\n\nBlanco’s secret measures, already semi-public since the printing house episode of July, were no longer secret. The Revolution was forced to begin.[14]\n\nAugust\n\nIn A New History Of Southeast Asia, M.C. Ricklefs,Bruce Lockhart, Bruce, and Albert Lau wrote:\n\nIn August 1896, under Bonifacio’s leadership, the Katipuneros decided to start the Revolution by seizing Manila. To break their ties with Spain they tore up their identification papers and shouted Mabuhay ang mga anak ng Bayan! (‘Long live the children of the nation!’). The assault failed, and expected reinforcements from Cavite never arrived. Bonifacio and other survivors retreated to the southern mountains, but news of the assault mobilized Katipuneros in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan to take up arms. Katipuneros of the two bickering councils of Cavite – Magdalo and Magdiwang – easily captured Cavite province. Landowner Emilio Aguinaldo, the Magdalo head, earned renown as a general, but Magdalo towns fell to the Spaniards, endangering the Magdiwang-heId towns to the rear.\n\nThe outbreak of the Philippine Revolution made life more difficult for the Filipino elite. To force them to join the revolutionaries, Katipuneros implicated some of them. Among the 4000 whom the Spanish arrested and imprisoned were many Ilustrados; some were executed and a number were deported. To escape persecution, others demonstrated their loyalty to the colonial government by donating money to the Spaniards and enrolling their sons as officers in local Spanish militias. But many members of the elite, especially in the provinces, concluded that – as in 1872 – wealth, status, and education were ineffective weapons against the declining Spanish empire. Quietly they joined and assumed leadership of various councils of the Katipunan. Their mestizo culture and Ilustrado worldview thereby pervaded and changed the orientation of the organization.[16]\n\nIn “Socioeconomic Class in the Revolution,” John Schumacher writes:\n\nIII. The Katipunan and the Revolution[17]\n\nSurely the key role of the Katipunan in initiating the Revolution cannot be denied. However, the Katipunan had not arisen solely from the ideas of Bonifacio. It was, in fact, the heir of the Propaganda Movement, too easily dismissed as an ineffective “reform movement.” There were to be sure, propagandists who sought nothing more than the assimilationist reforms their public program called for. But for its key figures — Rizal, Marcelo del Pilar, Antonio Luna, and others — there is no question that independence was the ultimate goal. The principal difference between Bonifacio and the major ilustrados of the Propaganda Movement was not even on the method of obtaining independence, but on the timing. The writings of Bonifacio and Jacinto mirror those of Rizal and Marcelo del Pilar, and the Katipunan’s official teachings are quite in continuity with the major works of the Propaganda Movement.\n\nIt is for this reason that though the initiative for the Revolution certainly came from Bonifacio and his Katipunan, once the Revolution began, it immediately attracted to itself a far larger number who had never been Katipuneros, but had imbibed similar ideas through the writings and activity of the Propagandists. In his memoirs Aguinaldo cites his cousin Baldomero Aguinaldo, speaking to the revolutionaries in Cavite of how there had been only 300 Katipuneros in that province on the eve of the Revolution, but the following day more than a thousand revolutionaries assembled. It was part of Bonifacio’s tragedy that he did not, or was unwilling to, realize that the Revolution was already a much wider movement than the Katipunan, and that there were others besides the Katipuneros who were legitimate heirs of the Propaganda Movement.\n\nAs the analysis of the Katipunan has shown, the actual initiative for the Revolution of 1896 came from a lower middle class urban membership allied with local and provincial elite, almost completely in the Tagalog provinces and Pampanga. It is not true, however, that the wealthy and educated took no part in it.\n\nThe national elite, not themselves part of the Katipunan, varied in their support for the Revolution once it was underway. Some of them, like Rizal and Antonio Luna, had been approached beforehand by the Katipuneros, but, though not rejecting revolution in principle, had argued that the means for a successful revolution were not yet at hand. Numerous figures of the old Liga Filipina or Cuerpo de Compromisarios, like Mabini and Moises Salvador, were arrested on suspicion by the Spaniards, and most were executed, however little or much had been their complicity in the actual revolt.[1] Others of the national elite, about to be arrested, escaped abroad and assisted the revolutionaries from Hong Kong, like Jose Alejandrino, Felipe Agoncillo, and Galicano Apacible.[2] Still others who were in Europe when the Revolution broke out, returned to take part in it, like Mariano Ponce in Hong Kong and Edilberto Evangelista, who was killed in the battle of Zapote Bridge in 1897.[3]\n\nMany of the very wealthy national elite, however, neither believed in the revolutionary cause nor were they willing to contribute to it. In consequence of Bonifacio’s having left to the authorities forged documents compromising them, some of them, like millionaire Francisco Roxas, who had refused to listen to the Katipunan’s demands for financial support, nonetheless paid with their lives.[4]\n\nTo summarize, elite attitudes to the Revolution of 1896 were varied. Though wealth was certainly a factor which was negatively correlated with willingness to join the Revolution, age was a more important factor than wealth by itself. The young ilustrados, wealthy or not, who had taken part in the Propaganda Movement, were generally found joining the Revolution; the older men who had held aloof from that movement, likewise held back when the Revolution came.”\n\n[1] Mabini, who escaped execution only because of his paralysis, had been a regular source of advice for the Katipuneros, but opposed their plans for revolt and became suspect to Bonifacio as a result. See Agoncillo, Revolt, pp. 105, 107. Salvador is said to have actually been a member of the Katipunan, but was arrested before he could join the revolt (Jose Alejandrino, La senda del sacrificio [Manila: Nueva Era Press, 1951], p. 29).\n\n[2] *Ibid., pp. 51-64; Esteban de Ocampo and Alfredo B. Saulo, First Filipino Diplomat: Felipe Agoncillo (1859-1941) (Manila: National Historical Institute. 1978), pp. 67-69; Encarnacion Alzona, Galicano Apacible: Profile of a Filipino Patriot (n.p., 1971)\n\n16 September:\n\nLuna brothers arrested\n\nAntonio Luna tortured, and in the process “cried hysterically,” (this is the description of Quibuyen):\n\nNo soy rebelde, ni mason, ni filibustero; al contrario, soy delator y creo haber cumplido como hijo leal de España. … El Kutipunan es la Liga Filipina. … Su autor es D. Jose Rizal …. Vuelvo a repitir: No soy rebelde, ni fiibustero, ni mason. –(Arch. Fil., IV, 199 [19]; cited in Guerrero 1963, 522, note 24)\n\nIn The Price of Freedom, Jose Alejandrino wrote how Luna implicates Masons:\n\n“It appears in official documents that in this period Luna committed the greatest error of his life in denouncing the existence of the Katipunan and in revealing, during his imprisonment after the first outbreak of the rebellion, the names of some of his friends affiliated with the Society. Later, he explained however to me his aforesaid acts by saying that with the physical and moral tortures which he suffered during his imprisonment, and upon being assured by the Spaniards that he had been squealed upon by his own friends, denouncing him as an accomplice in the rebellion, his violent character made him lose his better judgment. And having fallen for the scheme woven by the Spaniards, he declared that those who had denounced him were more guilty than he.\n\nThe events of 1896 separated us from each other, he having been prosecuted and later on sentenced to suffer imprisonment in Spain, while I left the country for China and Japan.[18]\n\nIn The Katipunan, Francis St. Claire writes:\n\nWhat Spain did for the Filipino brought forth fruit in only a few of the people who fell under her beneficent Christian influence. The Lunas were among the few. They like so many other ungrateful children, repaid their benefactors by becoming leaders of the insensate and inexcusable revolt against them; a revolt, the first act of which was to be the brutal murder of all Spaniards irrespective of parentage or other claims of consideration. Both the brothers suffered arrest by the Spanish authorities for rebellion and sedition, but in spite of the degree to which they were complicated, they remained practically free from punishment, and ever at the right hand of the imbecile General Blanco, himself a freemason, and friend of the enemies of his country. Eventually the two brothers left the ante-chamber of the Governor to enter the security of the military prison.\n\nBoth brothers eventually retracted their errors only to fall into them again as soon as the lying protests of repentance had fallen from their lips.\n\nJuan died in Hong-Kong; Antonio, after a career of militarism, succumbed to the same unprincipled ambition which carried Andres Bonifacio to an untimely grave.[19]\n\n1897\n\nJanuary 11, 1897\n\nNumeriano Adriano, lawyer (under whom Mabini had served as assistant attorney); Domingo Franco, merchant; Moises Salvador, propagandist; Antonio Salazar, owner of bazaar El Cisne; Faustino Villarael, Pandacan merchant, executed –allegedly after being implicated by Luna. Alfredo Saulo suggests that the fate of Adriano left ill-feelings on the part of Mabini towards Antonio Luna.\n\nFebruary 1897\n\nLuna incarcerated in Model Prison, Madrid.\n\nMay 1897\n\nLuna obtains clemency from King Alfonso XIII of Spain.\n\nUpon release, Luna begins study of military science.\n\n1898\n\nApril 21, 1898\n\nSpanish-American War begins.\n\nEarly May 1898\n\nIn The Roots of the Filipino Nation, O.D. Corpuz writes,\n\nIn addition to the evidence already shown, that some of the important men of the Propaganda abandoned reformism, note must be taken of those who came home and became prominent in the Hongkong Junta, the Revolution, and the Filipino-American War. Sandico and Apacible were “hawks” when Aguinaldo and the Junta were exploring the probable relations with the United States in early May 1898. Mariano Ponce served as Aguinaldo’s secretary in Hongkong. Canon, Evangelista, Sandico, Alejandrino, Llorente, and of course Luna, became generals in the Revolution. Numerous others served in the Malolos Congress and Republic.[20]\n\nMay 1, 1898\n\nDewey defeats Spanish fleet in Manila.\n\nSome years after this, in his “Statement before the Committee on Insular Affairs on Conditions in the Philippine Islands”, Felipe Buencamino said:\n\n“Mr. JONES. At that time had not Admiral Dewey placed in the hands of Aguinaldo arms with which to fight the Spaniards?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. No, sir. The occurrences I have already related at the last meeting. The Spanish commander at Cavite capitulated to Admiral Dewey. Immediately thereafter, after the destruction of the Spanish squadron, and on May 1, 1898, the Filipinos entered the city. Admiral Dewey informed the Filipinos he had not come to fight the Filipinos, but they could enter and go out of the city of Cavite as they pleased, and the Filipinos who entered the city found there some rifles abandoned by the Spaniards and took those arms away with them. But there was no formal delivery of arms by Admiral Dewey, because on that date Aguinaldo was not there yet. Aguinaldo arrived there on the 19th of May and those arms were gathered on the 1st day of May.”[22]\n\nMay 2, 1898\n\nIn the “Statement before the Committee on Insular Affairs on Conditions in the Philippine Islands”, Felipe Buencamino said:\n\n“Mr. JONES. Did you not upon the return of Aguinaldo to Cavite go to him for the purpose of inducing him to take up arms for Spain as against the United States, and did not Aguinaldo indignantly repudiate the proposition?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir; that was my mission.\n\nMr. JONES. Did not Aguinaldo convince you on that occasion that the Filipinos, with the aid of the American forces, were going to win, and did you not then become an ardent advocate of Filipino liberty and independence?\n\nMr. JONES. Did not Aguinaldo convince you on that occasion that the Filipinos, with the aid of the American forces, were going to win, and did you not then become an ardent advocate of Filipino liberty and independence?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. When I men Aguinaldo on the 2nd of May, 1898, I was not permitted to speak of my mission by Aguinaldo. I was informed only that he, Aguinaldo, came to establish the independence of the country with the assistance of Admiral Dewey. I then asked him to present to me the documentary evidence, promising if he would do so I would join them, first writing to the Spanish general, but Aguinaldo did not produce this documentary evidence, and then I told him I did not agree to the proposition because, as I told Aguinaldo, of the Spanish motto or saying, “Between a nation unknown and a nation known the nation known is preferable.” I did not know the Americans; I did not know what they might be. I was acquainted with the Spaniards; consequently it was my duty to be on the Spanish side.\n\nMr. JONES. And you did then go to Aguinaldo at Cavite for the purpose of inducing him to abandon the Americans and to side with the Spaniards against the American forces; that was your mission?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. There were no American forces as yet at that time, nor had Aguinaldo any troops yet, but he was going to organize troops, and before he organized them I was trying to get him to join the Spaniards, and I repeat the saying to which I have just called attention.”[22]\n\nTo add context to the above, Victor Buencamino, in his memoirs, writes this about his father:\n\nAND YET, FROM ALL accounts, Father should have had no regrets. I’d be mighty proud and consider myself fortunate if I had had a chance to play, as he did, such a billing among stars in the epic drama of his generation.\n\nA lawyer from Sto. Tomas, he was counted among the so-called ilustrados (elite) of the period who, by reason of their education, were engulfed in the upheaval that demanded the active participation of the intellectuals of the day.\n\nHistorians note that he was among the elite whom the last Spanish governor general enticed into joining a so-called Consultative Assembly that would run an autonomous regime but still under the Spanish crown. It was a desperate ploy to try to save a sinking ship. Anyway, it is recorded that Father was chosen by Captain General Augustin as emissary to General Aguinaldo with an offer of autonomy plus top military rank for Aguinaldo at some fancy salary.\n\nNot only was the offer rejected; Aguinaldo detained the emissary and later persuaded him to serve as one of the braintrusters of the revolution. So, when Aguinaldo formed his first cabinet following the declaration of Independence in 1898, Father was named Director of Public Works.\n\nIt is also recorded that Father was among the key figures at the Malolos Congress; that, in fact, he was credited with having composed the flamboyant prose that Aguinaldo read as the first inaugural address of a Philippine president.\n\nIn the turbulent episode which saw Apolinario Mabini relieved as premier by Pedro A. Paterno, my father was given the portfolio of the secretary of foreign affairs. [68]\n\nMay 10, 1898\n\nSecretary of the Navy John D. Long issued orders to Captain Henry Glass, commander of the cruiser U.S.S. Charleston to capture Guam on the way to Manila.\n\nMay 11, 1898\n\nPresident William McKinley and his cabinet approve a State Department memorandum calling for Spanish cession of a suitable “coaling station”, presumably Manila. The Philippines were to remain Spanish possessions.\n\nMay 11, 1898\n\nPrime Minister Sagasta formed the new Spanish cabinet. U.S. President McKinley ordered a military expedition, headed by Major General Wesley Merritt, to complete the elimination of Spanish forces in the Philippines, to occupy the islands, and to provide security and order to the inhabitants.\n\nMay 19, 1898\n\nEmilio Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines, from exile in Hong Kong. The United States had invited him back from exile, hoping that Aguinaldo would rally the Filipinos against the Spanish colonial government.\n\nIn the “Statement before the Committee on Insular Affairs on Conditions in the Philippine Islands”, Felipe Buencamino said:\n\nMr. JONES. At that time had not Admiral Dewey placed in the hands of Aguinaldo arms with which to fight the Spaniards?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. No, sir. The occurrences I have already related at the last meeting.

What time in May was it that you went to Aguinaldo on this mission?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I went there on the 22nd of May, but was received on the 24th, in the evening.\n\nMr. JONES. Then you went to see Aguinaldo on the 22d day of May for the purpose of inducing him to side with the Spaniards against the Americans and in June of that same year you abandoned the Spaniards and went over to Aguinaldo?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I did not abandon the Spaniards; the Spaniards abandoned me, because the Spanish general in Cavite, who had 1,600 men under him and munitions of war and provisions for six months, surrendered to Aguinaldo without firing a shot, saying that they did not defend the cause of Spain in the Philippines, but the cause of the friars. I could not be more Spanish than the Spaniards; as for example, if the Americans should abandon the Filipinos now I could not defend the Americans there.\n\nMr. JONES. Then you did not abandon the Spaniards until they had surrendered to the Filipinos, and, as you say, they had abandoned you?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir. I was kept seventeen days a prisoner of Aguinaldo,\n\nfrom the 22nd of May to the 12th of June, and only when I saw I was abandoned by the Spaniards I passed over to Aguinaldo.\n\nMr. JONES. Then you became an ardent advocate of liberty and independence for the Filipino people, did you not?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir; in view of Admiral Dewey’s promise.[22]\n\nMay 24, 1898\n\nWith himself as the dictator, Emilio Aguinaldo established a dictatorial government.\n\nMay 25, 1898\n\nFirst U.S. troops were sent from San Francisco to the Philippines.

After the war commenced on the 28th of May, four days after you had gone there for the purpose of inducing Aguinaldo to side with the Spaniards, which side did you take?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I was on the Spanish side. On the side of my people, because Aguinaldo did not then represent my people, unless you understand that there are no Filipino people except Aguinaldo.[24]\n\nJune-October 1898\n\nU.S. business and government circles united around a policy of retaining all or part of the Philippines.\n\nJune 2, 1898\n\nFelipe Agoncillo, President of the Hong Kong Junta, recommending Luna for appointment in the army.\n\nJune 12, 1898\n\nGerman squadron under Admiral Diederichs arrives at Manila.

How long after that was it before you cast your fortunes in with Aguinaldo?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. On the 12th day of June of the same year.[26]\n\nJune 14, 1898\n\nMcKinley administration decided not to return the Philippine Islands to Spain.\n\nJune 15, 1898\n\nAdmiral Cámara’s squadron received orders to relieve Spanish garrison in Philippines.\n\nAmerican Anti-Imperialist League was organized in opposition to the annexation of the Philippine Islands. Among its members were Andrew Carnegie, Mark Twain, William James, David Starr Jordan, and Samuel Gompers. George S.

Spanish Admiral Manuel de la Cámara y Libermoore’s squadron received orders to relieve the Spanish garrison in the Philippines. His fleet consisted of the battleship Pelayo, the armored cruiser Carlos V, the cruisers Rápido and Patriota, the torpedo boats Audaz, Osado, and Proserpina, and the transports Isla de Panay, San Francisco, Cristóbal Colón, Covadonga, and Buenos Aires. (Library of Congress, The World of 1898: the Spanish-American war)\n\nJune 23, 1898\n\nRevolutionary Government Established.\n\nAlejandrino stated:\n\nWe played a secondary and very humble role in the Dictatorial Government and, seeing the state of inaction to which we were being doomed, we requested as a special favor that we be permitted to study the terrain over which we believed the war would be staged with more vigor. This was the territory along the Manila-Dagupan railway. The Government acceded gladly to our petition. Armed with recommendations to the chiefs who commanded the lines, we proceeded to Malabon and Kalookan. After making a study of the terrain, we decided that the line from Kalookan to Novaliches was a good line of defense along which should be dug strong trenches.[27]\n\nJuly 1898\n\nLuna arrives in the Philippines. Alejandrino meets Luna:\n\nWe were able to see each [other] again in Kabite toward the month of July, 1898. He was returning home after having served his sentence in the Model Prison of Madrid, and he brought with him in his baggage books on military strategy and tactics and treatises on field fortifications. Above all, he brought with him a desire to atone for his past mistakes.[27]\n\nJuly 18, 1898\n\nThe Spanish government, through the French Ambassador to the United States, Jules Cambon, initiated a message to President McKinley to suspend the hostilities and to start the negotiations to end the war. Duque de Almodóvar del Río (Juan Manuel Sánchez y Gutiérrez de Castro), Spanish Minister of State, directed a telegram to the Spanish Ambassador in Paris charging him to solicit the good offices of the French Government to negotiate a suspension of hostilities as a preliminary to final negotiations. (Library of Congress, The World of 1898: the Spanish-American war)\n\nJuly 23, 1898\n\nIn The Roots of the Filipino Nation, O.D. Corpuz writes:\n\nAn important development in the army was the appearance on the scene of Antonio Luna. He was in Hongkong in. July 1898 on the way home after his release from prison in Madrid. Felipe Agoncillo, Aguinaldo’s representative there, thought well of him, entrusting him with twenty revolvers and thirty-five boxes of bullets plus a letter dated 23 July, all for Aguinaldo. The letter reported that Luna “earnestly desires to serve our country…” [28]\n\nJuly 25, 1898\n\nGeneral Wesley Merritt, commander of Eighth Corps, U.S. Expeditionary Force, arrived in the Philippines.\n\nJuly 30, 1898\n\nU.S. President McKinley and his Cabinet submitted to Ambassador Cambon a counter-proposal to the Spanish request for ceasefire.\n\nIn The US Army & Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, Brian McAllister Linn writes:\n\nOn 30 July 1898, he [Aguinaldo] authorized each Tagalog province to create a battalion of provincial forces which would join three new “Aguinaldo” regiments of federal troops and form the Republican Army. At the same time, he continued to encourage the continued formation of revolutionary Sandahatan, town companies, independent battalions, and other units which drew their strength from local or personal loyalties.[29]\n\nAugust 2, 1898\n\nSpain accepted the U.S. proposals for peace, with certain reservations regarding the Philippines. McKinley called for a preliminary protocol from Spain before suspension of hostilities. That document was used as the basis for discussion between Spain and the United States at the Treaty of Peace in Paris.\n\nAugust 11, 1898\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Day and French Ambassador Cambon, representing Spain, negotiated the Protocol of Peace.\n\nAugust 12, 1898\n\nPeace protocol that ended all hostilities between Spain and the United States in the war fronts of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines was signed in Washington, D.C.\n\nAugust 13, 1898\n\nManila falls to U.S. troops.\n\nAugust 14, 1898\n\nCapitulation was signed at Manila and U.S. General Wesley Merritt established a military government in the city, with himself serving as first military governor.\n\nAugust 15, 1898\n\nU.S. General Arthur MacArthur appointed military commandant of Manila and its suburbs.\n\nSeptember 3, 1898\n\nFirst issue of Luna’s newspaper, La Independencia, comes out.\n\nIn The Katipunan, again, writing from the point of view of the friars, Francis St. Claire wrote:\n\n[1] La Independencia was a revolutionary daily of four pages, published in the Orphan Asylum of Malabon, property of the Augustinian Corporation and stolen and eventually destroyed by the “ever destructive” Tagalog rebels during the revolution. The first number was published on Saturday, 3rd Sept. 1898.

This honor, however, he declined. The Independencia, speaking on this incident, says: “The military knowledge of Sr. Luna, acquired during his captivity (sic) in the prisons of the peninsular (Spain), is to be found condensed in two small works, one concerning the organization of the army, having as its base the idea of obligatory service in which he demonstrates that Luzon might put on a war footing 250,000 to 400,000 men, and the whole Archipelago as many as from 800,000 to 900,000. The other work is a practical course in field fortifications as adopted by the French and German armies.”[1][15]\n\n45 days later Luna will be promoted to General of Division with assimilated rank of Major General, third highest in military hierarchy.\n\nIn The development of Philippine politics, Maximo Kalaw writes:\n\nGeneral Luna was, in the opinion of many observers, the ablest general of the revolution. He represented the well-to-do Filipinos who were indifferent to the revolutionary cause in 1896, but who in 1898 joined Aguinaldo with enthusiasm. Aguinaldo had at this time, as we have noticed, the almost unanimous support of the people. Yet complaints were sometimes heard among military officials as to the partiality shown by Aguinaldo for people who came from his province of Cavite and also for those who had been with him during the first revolution. These people were not necessarily the most intelligent of the revolutionary officials. In fact it may be said without fear of contradiction that, as a general rule, the later additions, like Generals Luna and Concepcion, showed greater military ability than the “deans and fathers” of the Philippine Revolution, as they were often called. It was rather mortifying for the new and more intelligent officers to be under the orders of officers less versed in military matters than they were. At the same time it was but human on the part of Aguinaldo to recognize the worth of men who had shown greater loyalty to the cause by joining it at the time when there were fewer chances of success. That Aguinaldo, however, was not entirely blind to great merit when real merit was in evidence, was shown by the rapid advance of General Luna.[30]\n\nOctober 1, 1898\n\nThe Spanish and United States Commissioners convened their first meeting in Paris to reach a final Treaty of Peace.\n\nOctober 25, 1898\n\nMcKinley instructed the U.S. peace delegation to insist on the annexation of the Philippines in the peace talks.\n\nIn the “Statement before the Committee on Insular Affairs on Conditions in the Philippine Islands”, Felipe Buencamino said:\n\nBuencamino: “General Luna was appointed lieutenant general of the army in October, 1898. He organized the entire army, but he was a very cruel, inhuman man in his command, because from that date, October, 1898, to June 5, 1900, when he died, he had ordered the execution of 160 persons, under the pretext of their being spies and traitors. His cruelty went to such extremes that when I was visited from Manila by my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, and my two sons, who are minors, and who are at present in San Francisco, he ordered them arrested and said that they were spies; and he also ordered the execution of Baron Dumarais, the French agent of the General Tobacco Company, of Manila, who entered our camp requesting an interview with Aguinaldo to treat on tobacco questions in the province of Cagayan, where many millions of dollars are invested in tobacco. By reason of these cruelties the public almost demanded his removal; but he was a very active and intelligent military man, a great patriot, and was very brave, and he had a large number of admirers among the military men. Aguinaldo objected to many of his orders, and that was the reason for the differences between them. Two bands were then formed within the Philippine army, one for General Luna and the other for General Aguinaldo.” [31]\n\nReviewing the outbreak of the Philippine-American War in February, 1899, Felipe Buencamino testified before the US Congress that preparations had begun in October, 1898, based on intelligence from Felipe Agoncillo:\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. This is my conviction, and I maintain it up to the present time, for the following reasons: In the first place, because on that day, the 4th of February, as I was with Aguinaldo constantly, I knew that he had not issued any order for the beginning of hostilities. As 1 said before in my first statement, we received a telegram from Agoncillo in October, 1898, stating that we would be deceived by President McKinley and the American Congress, and consequently that we should make preparations for war. As I have already said, Aguinaldo and Luna began making preparations. Secret preparations were made in Manila to catch the American Army between two fires.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN. When did those preparations begin?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. In October.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN. What year?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. 1898. General Otis discovered the secret preparations in Manila and he ordered all houses searched and found more than 500 rifles; but we had more than 1,600 rifles hidden. Our engineer battalions and four cavalry troops were still to be organized before the orders to attack were to be given, and it is very possible that General Otis, before permitting himself to be caught between two fires, and knowing the decisive intention of General Aguinaldo to attack the American forces, took precautions in order not to see himself caught again, because the American forces were very small at the time and it was Luna’s intention to collect our 40,000 rifles and enter Manila, and for that reason I sustained the opinion; but I have not the evidence that the order to attack came from the American forces. Not as a political question, perhaps, but as a question of vital necessity.\n\nMr. JONES. You now speak of Aguinaldo and Luna commencing to make preparations with a view to organizing a force to oppose the Americans. On yesterday, when I asked you about these alleged preparations on the part of Aguinaldo, you said that you had never said that Aguinaldo made any preparations, and I asked you then whom you had said had made preparations, and you said that General Luna made them. Why is it now that you undertake to connect Aguinaldo with what you said yesterday he had nothing to do?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. You asked me yesterday if I said to anyone before I appeared before the committee that Aguinaldo had made secret preparations in Manila to attack the American forces. That is what I deny. I never, before I appeared here, made such a statement. I have never told any of Aguinaldo’s secrets, and if General Otis discovered them, he discovered them for himself. That is what I said yesterday. So there is no contradiction at all in what I have said.[31]\n\nNovember 12, 1898\n\nBy a vote of 26 to 25, Malolos Congress approves article in draft Constitution providing for the separation of Church and State.\n\nIn The Price of Freedom, Jose Alejandrino writes:\n\n“Antonio [Luna] became also a member of [the Malolos] Congress …. Eloquent speeches from each group were pronounced but there never was a voting because both groups were afraid of the result of the balloting. Luna broke the situation with one of those tricks peculiar to his character and which made him famous later. He assembled all those delegates of the radical faction who had confidence in him advising them to keep away from the sessions of the Congress but requesting them to remain within call at a moment’s notice. With the radicals absent, the Conservatives constituted a majority during the sessions. Having made a careful counting and thinking themselves sure of victory, the Conservatives asked for a vote while the few radicals present registered a token opposition. The motion to call a vote was carried. Then at the precise moment of balloting, Luna immediately called all his advisers to enter the session hall en masse to the surprise of the confident Conservatives. The voting was taken and we won, if I remember right, by one or two votes. [In fact, they won by one vote.] In this manner [the] provision in our Constitution for the separation of the Church and State was secured.”[32]\n\nNovember 25, 1898\n\nIn The Roots of the Filipino Nation, O.D. Corpuz writes:\n\nOn 25 November Antonio Luna y Novicio was formally appointed Director of War in the War Department by decree of Aguinaldo. The decree stated:\n\nAs Director of War, he is the Supreme Chief of the Army, after the General-in-Chief and the Secretary. The honors and military grade corresponding to him by reason of this office are those inhering in a General of Division…\n\nA portion of this decree states that Luna preferred to remain a civilian although his rank in the War Department corresponded to that of a General of Division. Luna’s military career was colorful, ending in tragedy during the Filipino-American War. [35]\n\nNovember 28, 1898\n\nThe Spanish Commission for Peace accepted the United States’ demands in the Peace Treaty.\n\nNovember 29, 1898\n\nThe Philippine revolutionary congress approved a constitution for the new Philippine Republic.\n\nAguinaldo tenders his resignation as President.\n\nIn The Revolutionists: Aguinaldo, Bonifacio, Jacinto, Epifanio De los Santos writes:\n\nVIII.–THE BREAKING OF HOSTILITIES AND AGUINALDO’S ODYSSEY\n\nIn order to fully devote himself to military exploits, Aguinaldo decided to resign from the position of President. In 1896, he also wanted to revoke his responsibility as Commander-in-Chief of the Revolution and relinquish the post the to Engineer Evangelista, the hero of Zapote. On Christmas Day of 1899, he secretly issued a manifesto wherein he appealed to the people to relieve him of the presidency as a token of gift that day. The resounding news created agitation and consternation among the prominent military and civil officials. However, without Aguinaldo’s knowledge, the packages containing the manifestoes, long prepared for circulation, disappeared like magic. One could therefore foresee the impending tragedy; notwithstanding, the instinct of self-preservation and devotion to one’s ideal demanded retention of the unique and real prestige of the people. They could have their mutual complaints and dissensions but they would never argue with Aguinaldo. They believed that a complete revamp of the Cabinet, not the relief of Aguinaldo, was necessary. When the dictatorial government was established in 1898, the organizers of the Katipunan in 1896 expected some untoward events for the positions of greater responsibilities were not entrusted to them. Nevertheless, an advice of Aguinaldo was enough to pacify them. According to Mabini, the withdrawal of the revolutionary forces from the suburbs of Manila would not have suffered the humiliations of a retreat if it were of Aguinaldo’s prestige and not at the behest of the American Military Government. When General Luna apprehended Paterno and Buencamino as pacifists in Cabanatuan, Aguinaldo’s intervention was enough to make Luna return and report at Bayambang to facilitate Buencamino’s capture in that place (May 25, 1899).\n\nThe national tragedy began on February 4, 1899, the day when the Filipino-American hostilities broke out.[33]\n\nDecember 10, 1898\n\nRepresentatives of Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Peace in Paris. Spain renounced all rights to Cuba and allowed an independent Cuba, ceded Puerto Rico and the island of Guam to the United States, gave up its possessions in the West Indies, and sold the Philippine Islands, receiving in exchange $20,000,000.\n\nIn“Lo que decimos,” in La Independencia, Luna said:\n\nOh people! Die defending your independence and the sanctity of your homes. Shed your blood and do not give less now that the Motherland demands from you the invaluable offering of your life. Forward! God and men applaud your conduct and consecrate your right: they shall be the impartial judges in this titanic struggle brought about by foreign arms and avarice… Forward! Conquer or die! “\n\n21 December: President McKinley issued his “Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation, “ ceding the Philippines to the United States, and instructing the American occupying army to use force, as necessary, to impose American sovereignity over the Philippines even before he obtained Senate ratification of the peace treaty with Spain. [34]\n\nDecember 27, 1898\n\nIn The Roots of the Filipino Nation, O.D. Corpuz writes:\n\nBy 27 December 1898 General Antonio Luna reported that all the provinces of Luzon; the islands of Mindoro, Marinduque, Masbate, Ticao, Romblon; part of Panay island; and the Batanes as well as Babuyanes island groups were under the control of the Revolutionary Government. As we can see from the progress of the Revolution in the Visayas, even the Luna report was not complete.[35]\n\n1899\n\nFebruary to November of 1899\n\nConventional War Operations; in November, 1899: shift to Guerrilla Operations.\n\nJanuary 1899\n\nEmilio Aguinaldo was declared president of the new Philippine Republic, following the meeting of a constitutional convention. United States authorities refused to recognize the new government.\n\nJanuary 21, 1899\n\nThe constitution of the Philippine Republic (the Malolos Constitution), was promulgated by Emilio Aguinaldo.\n\nIn The Revolutionists: Aguinaldo, Bonifacio, Jacinto, Epifanio De los Santos writes:\n\nOn the other hand, when there was a conspiracy to oust Mabini as President of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, Aguinaldo extended full support in his favor. Mabini won.** He also upheld Mabini’s opinion to the end regarding the retention of Spanish prisoners contrary to General Luna’s contention of being “a burden against the exchequer and a very cumbersome impedimdent.”\n\nAlthough the Malolos Constitution dropped Mabini’s Program, it may be said that it was not at all worthless. It was neither a mere piece of legislation like the multicolored cape of Tirabeque nor a consequence of the malicious influence of the ninth article of Mabini’s True Decalogue. It was precisely a type of revolutionary anarchy after the demobilization of forces as mentioned by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, for the popular suffrage contained in the Malolos Constitution was already provided in the organic decree of June 18, a retrospection of the constitutional conjectures made on October 31, 1896. It showed traces of the war undertaken by Edilberto Evangelista, the hero of Zapote; Emilio Jacinto, the brains of Katipunan; the Sanguniang Hukuman; and the council of elders of the ancient Tagalogs; the woman’s suffrage, and while the English language is sufficiently taught and learned throughout the Philippine Archipelago, and will then be declared the official language, in the meantime however, Tagalog will remain. They are all anticipated in the Program we are now discussing. Article 5, Title 3, concerning the separation of the Church and the State, was not the ardent love of the framers of the Malolos Constitution, especially of Felipe C. Calderón who drafted it, although, the latter had represented the interests of the Filipino clergy inside and outside of Congress and had been the Director of El Católico Filipino.[1] Moreover, he was with Mabini and Aglipay on this question. If the provision for the separation of the Church and the State had garnered a vote, it was because of the military influence of General Luna as a leader and director of the popular La Independencia which was known as a separatist newspaper; and for this reason, two of its undisputed clergy-concerned editors did not attend the convention. Pablo Tecson resolved the tie. Besides being a separatist, he knew Aguinaldo, Luna and the La Independencia had supported his vote. After having won in the voting, the separatist group became complacent, hence, their restless opponents were able to convince Mabini to interpolate an additional article with some modifications of his famous amendment, suspending the implementation of Article 5, Title 3, until the next meeting of the constituent Assembly. The consent of the National Assembly on this insertion was off the record; nevertheless, it was indicated in the officially printed Constitution.\n\nIn spite of adverse events, the Malolos Constitution, although provisional, was commendable. Calderón, who always consulted Don Cayetano Arellano relative thereto, was very much inspired by his colleague, Dr. Joaquín Gonzales, one of the most industrious and cultured Filipinos who was subsequently appointed Director of Civil Service. Like any of other Constitution, it was unanimously approved inside and outside of Congress. Mabini after giving his approval to “the judicious opinion of our beloved country”, said:\n\n…that this monumental work is the most glorious achievement of the noble aspirations of the Philippine Revolution and the conclusive proof before the civilized world of the cultured and capacity of the Filipino people to govern themselves.\n\nThis Constitution was decreed by the following delegates:”\n\n** Aguinaldo nominated Mabini Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, but the influential members of Congress, led by Paterno and Rianzares Bautista, opposed Mabini’s election ot the Tribunal. Aguinaldo gave in. Mabini cannot be said to have won, as E. de los santos says. – T. A. A.\n\n[1] E. de los Santos was an appointed member of the Malolos Congress and was, therefore, familiar with many of its members and with the “goings-on” in the Chamber – T. A. A.[33]\n\nJanuary 23, 1899\n\nLuna becomes Commanding General of the Philippine Army.\n\nIn The Price of Freedom, Jose Alejandrino writes:\n\nGeneral Luna, by virtue of the order he received, left immediately for Malolos in a special train. After a conference with the Captain General who was the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, he received from him an order to lead the troops guarding the Kalookan line. The order, however, was ambiguous, as was true of all orders emanating from Malolos, in such a manner that this command resulted in being almost nominal only.[36]\n\nFebruary 4, 1899\n\nThe Philippine-American War began as the Philippine Republic declared war on the United States forces, following the killing of three Filipino soldiers by U.S. forces in a suburb of Manila.\n\nLuna assumes post of chief of operations in Luzon.\n\nIn The Development of Philippine Politics, Maximo Kalaw writes:\n\nAs soon ‘ as hostilities began between Americans and Filipinos, Luna was appointed commander-in-chief of the Filipino forces in Central Luzon, where most of the fighting was done. The poor preparation of Aguinaldo’s forces was manifest during the first weeks of the campaign and some military observers believe that if General Luna had been put in charge of the preparation of the army before the opening of hostilities, the Filipino army might have been able to offer better resisting qualities. [30]\n\nIn La Revolucion Filipina, Mabini writes:\n\nOnly after the outbreak of hostilities, when the telegraph line had already been cut, did he [Aguinaldo] name General Luna commander of the forces operating around Manila, but by that time the various army units had already evacuated their old emplacements, and communications among them had become slow and hazardous. Furthermore, Luna resigned his command shortly afterward because the War Minister had disapproved one of his dispositions. However, he resumed command of the defensive operations north of Manila when the Philippine government was compelled to leave Malolos for San Isidro in the province of Nueva Ecija. [37]\n\nIn The Price of Freedom, Jose Alejandrino writes:\n\nOn a certain occasion, while we were sitting in front of a lunch served better than the usual ones, Luna, who was in good humor, called Garcia and asked him if he was ready to disturb the digestion of the enemy general who, according to intelligence reports, was staying in the house of Higgins and must be at that precise moment also eating. Garcia with his “Very well, my general” which still rings in my ears like the laconic and smiling sayonara of the Japanese whenever they are sent on a dangerous mission, took with him some of his men and, after the very time when he should be at the place to which he was ordered to go, we heard short but lively exchange of shots from the lines. Luna, upon hearing the shooting, could not help but exclaim: “It is a pity that there are not many Garcias!” I believe that there is a providence for the brave because Garcia returned without injury from that exploit.\n\nLuna was of an impulsive temper, violent in his passions and with an inexorable heart when he believed it convenient to lay down his iron hand. He was a samurai by instinct, incapable of abandoning a comrade in moments of danger, and ready to do anything within his power to reward valor and to mitigate the sufferings of a soldier who complies with his duty. So long as acts of service were involved, he did not take into account either friendship or family ties. He was gifted with a fearful courage and he considered it a dishonor to run in the face of any danger whatever it might be.[38]\n\nIn the “Statement before the Committee on Insular Affairs on Conditions in the Philippine Islands”, Felipe Buencamino said:\n\nMr. JONES. Before you make that further statement I would like to ask you one or two questions, and then you will be permitted to make any statement or explanation which you desire, but I would much prefer that you answer my questions as briefly as possible before you make any statement or explanation. What authority had you for your statement contained in this memorial to Congress that the American forces commenced hostilities on the 4th of February, 1899, in accordance with the orders of President William McKinley?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. The authority of the council of Aguinaldo as I wrote that memorial, not as Felipe Buencamino, but as the secretary of Aguinaldo.\n\nMr. JONES. The memorial is signed “Felipe Buencamino,” not as secretary of Aguinaldo, or in any other official capacity. Why did you not sign it as secretary for Aguinaldo if you wrote it at his instance?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. If your memory does not fail you you will remember that I said the document was not authentic. In the authentic document in Spanish which I wrote my title appears as secretary of Aguinaldo, and that appears in the preamble in the English itself – that I wrote this at the command of my government, at that time Filipino.\n\nMr. JONES. I understand you to say that when this memorial was written you entertained exactly the sentiments and opinions expressed in it?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. It is my opinion that when I acted officially as secretary I did not express but the logic of the documents which were presented to me by Mr. Aguinaldo. Those documents were denied by Admiral Dewey, as well as by Consul Pratt at Singapore and by Consul Wildman at Hongkong, afterwards, and for those reasons nobody paid any attention to this document at that time, when some attention should have been paid to it. No American paid any attention to it at that time, and now there is a great deal made of it.\n\nMr. JONES. You attach to that memorial a number of additional documents which you declare in the memorial would sustain the statements which you had made. Are those documents authentic?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. They were given to me as authentic documents, but they were denied to such an extent that Consul Pratt brought a suit against Bray, Aguinaldo’s agent in Singapore, and the British tribunals in Singapore sentenced this Englishman for libel and to pay a fine of $6,000, which Agoncillo asked me, as secretary of state, to authorize him to pay.\n\nMr. JONES. Although you admit that you prepared this memorial to Congress, and that it correctly represents the views which you entertained at that time, you now say that you repudiate, for the reasons you have given, the whole memorial and its statements?\n\nMr. TAWNEY. Before he answers that question, has he said that the memorial correctly represents his views? Did he not say that it was written for Aguinaldo?\n\nMr. JONES. He said that it did represent his individual views and sentiments, and that he wrote it at the instance of Aguinaldo, and that he did entertain those views at that time. You have not, as I understand, translated the document?’\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I have read it.\n\nMr. JONES. You have read it?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir.\n\nMr. JONES. And it correctly expresses the ideas which you entertained at that time and which you intended by it to convey to the American Congress?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir; by reason of Admiral Dewey’s alleged promises.\n\nMr. JONES. Do I understand you to say that the original in Spanish had been sent to Hongkong to the junta there?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir.\n\nMr. JONES. Is the original in Hongkong now? Do you know where it is?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I do not know. I suppose it must be there.\n\nMr. JONES. Why did you say then on yesterday, that you would like to be allowed, before testifying as to this, to send to Manila and get the original?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I have a copy in Manila. It was printed in Spanish. But the original, signed by Aguinaldo, was sent to Hongkong.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN. The original was signed by Aguinaldo?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir; and for this reason: It would not have been accepted as authentic with my signature only. After my signature Aguinaldo put the word “authentic” and affixed his signature. These are some of Aguinaldo’s secrets.\n\nMr. JONES. The copy of that memorial which I have in my hand, and which I have shown to the witness, contains a note in these words: Official editions of this correspondence have been forwarded through the post to the presidents of both Houses.\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. That appears there, but on the original, of course, it did not appear. The members of the junta at Hongkong were the ones to do that.\n\nMr. JONES. This seems to have been printed in Hongkong.\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. That may be, but I have not submitted any English documents to the Hongkong junta, but a document in Spanish for transmission by the junta here.[39]\n\nMr. JONES. The notes of the stenographer will show, and I hope they will be properly transcribed. In this memorial these words are used: It is sometimes said that we are to blame for the outbreak of hostilities during the night of the 4th of February last, but this is not an established fact.\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir. For the attack of that night they were not to blame at all.\n\nMr. JONES. For the attack of that night the Filipinos were not to blame at all?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. That is my opinion.\n\nMr. JONES. It is also stated in this memorial: It is unquestionable that we were not aggressors, for we know full well that were we to act on the offensive we could look for neither military or political gain of any kind. On the contrary, we regarded such action as bordering on suicidal folly, and well-nigh sure to bring down on us the hatred and contempt of the American people. We had, in fact, nothing to gain and very much to lose by aggression. Did you write that statement, expressing your own views and those of your associates, or did you write it as expressing the views of Aguinaldo?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I wrote that statement as expressing the views of Aguinaldo’s private secretary; not as a private individual.[40]\n\nMr. JONES. You said in this memorial: The only possible way to accomplish your object is to destroy the lives of 8,000,000 Filipinos, an act which would leave on the hitherto–\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. I do not understand that question very fully.\n\nMr. JONES. You desire me to repeat the question.\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. If you please.\n\nMr. JONES. This memorial addressed to the American Congress made use of these words: The only possible way to accomplish your object is to destroy the lives of 8,000,000 Filipinos, an act which would leave on the hitherto spotless pages of your glorious history and traditional liberality an everlasting and indelible stain. Now, what I want to know is, Do you still adhere to that statement, that the only possible way by which the American people can extend their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands is to destroy the lives of 8,000,000 Filipinos?\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. That was the idea of the Philippine government at that time, but the true facts are that, beginning with Aguinaldo, all those who said they were going to die are still living.\n\nMr. JONES. And one of those still living is yourself, and you are enjoying a fat office under the American Government, are you not? And your associate, Aguinaldo, is now in prison\n\nThe CHAIRMAN. Mr. Buencamino is alive, and he has admitted many times that he holds an office.\n\nMr. JONES. We know that Aguinaldo is alive and that he is now a prisoner.\n\nMr. BUENCAMINO. Yes, sir; but I did not express my opinion in that case. There I expressed the opinion of Aguinaldo and one of the bravest men they had at that time. Consequently if I live now it is not because I surrendered. I was captured, and if I live now it is due to the humanity of the American Army, which should have shot me twenty times over. For this reason I esteem the American sovereignty now because I have understood it to be a very humane one.[41]\n\nIn The Price of Freedom, Jose Alejandrino writes:\n\nThe great majority of the rich and educated elements who had been attracted to the cause of the Revolution during its successes were in no manner capable of following up in times of adversities. Neither were they imbued with enough self-abnegation and patriotism to stake their material interests and conveniences and, much less their lives, on the hazards of an arduous and unequal struggle. Undoubtedly, upon the outbreak of the war they were sincere in manifesting that all the Filipinos should fight to the end, but subsequent events demonstrated that their convictions were not deep-rooted. For hardly have they encountered the opportunity, they formed without any honorable exception the nucleus of the pro-annexation Federal Party which worked so hard to disarm by all means imaginable the men whom they themselves had encouraged to fight the war.\n\n[…]\n\nThe enlightened class who came to Malolos in order to fill honorific positions which could serve to shield them against the reprisals of the people for their previous misconduct, flew away like birds with great fright upon hearing the first gun report, hiding their important persons in some corner, meantime that they could not find occasion to place themselves under the protection of the American Army. Only a few followed the Government in its odessey and, certainly, less enlisted in the army.\n\nFrom the rich class neither could the country expect any efficacious aid, because in a reunion held in Malolos by the most distinguished financiers for the floating of domestic bonds, despite the fact that the one who appeared at the head of these Croesuses had subscribed for P50,000, but under a fictitious arrangement with the Government — I believe — just so such a large subscription might excite the patriotism of the others, the amounts subscribed were however very insignificant. Later on, I learned that many of those who had subscribed did not comply with their commitments, and that some of those who received deposits of the payments on these subscriptions had misappropriated them. Our ideas of probity and love of country must have been distorted, as these men whom the public point out with an accusing finger still enjoy the esteem and favors not only of the popular masses who have subsequently elected them "
