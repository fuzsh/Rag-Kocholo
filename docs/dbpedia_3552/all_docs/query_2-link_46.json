        "text": "Argues that the establishment of the Christmas-Epiphany liturgical cycle was the result of a developing Christology which came to recognize the need to acknowledge Christ's Messianic status at his birth rather than merely at his Baptism, and how it was a compromise between the Eastern and Western feasts of the Nativity.\n\n(2016; term paper) For more than a decade, evangelical Protestants and political conservatives have warned of a \"War in Christmas\" in the United States. Does such a \"War\" exist? And if so, how is it being waged, and to what end? This paper explores the roots of the \"War on Christmas\" — who fights it, who profits from it — and the underlying mindset, particularly among conservative Christians, that makes the \"War on Christmas\" charge such a potent one."
