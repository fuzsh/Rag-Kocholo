        "text": "The title of this blogpost is the summary of our love to Pope St. John Paul II. He is arguably the most beloved Pontiff by Filipinos in history because of his unexplainably supernatural effect to our people from the moment he visited our country a few decades ago and this can be still today with parents naming their children after him, numerous keepsakes from his 2 Papal Visits na the fond memories attached to it, the enormous grief the nation felt when he passed away in 2005 and the tremendous joy that we expressed when he was beatified and canonized years later. Parishes in his honor are established, images of the late Pontiff became a staple of modern day Filipino altars, devotions in his honor soon arises and his relics became a focal point of devotion and pilgrimages over the past few years.\n\nNow, we will look back in our history, specifically his visits in the Philippines and his tremendous effect that gave a lasting impact to our nation as we commemorate the centenary of his birth and what will be our take away from his this piece of history in our church and our nation.\n\nThe First Visit as a Cardinal\n\nOur story with the Polish Pontiff began in 1976 when he visited our country then as Kraków Archbishop Karol Cardinal Wojtyla. A Swedish journalist, who had known the Pope when he was still assigned to the Roman news beat, shared that knowing he would not be here for long, took the first cab he saw at the airport and asked the driver to the take him to the nearest church.\n\nThe nearest church happened to be that of Baclaran shrine, where he celebrated mass, thanks to the Redemptorist fathers. He was impressed by the devotion of the Filipinos to the Blessed Mother, as Our Mother Perpetual Help, from the large attendance of devotees and who continue to flock the Shrine even in the late hours of the night until the wee hours in the morning. In his return in 1981 as a Pope, he was greeted this time with millions of devotees and reminded them to continue their devotion to Mary and stressed the importance of Social justice.\n\nThe First Papal Visit\n\nThe Polish Pontiff returned to our country, now as a Pope, in 1981 and stayed from February 17 – 22, 1981. Ahead of the Pope’s visit on Feb. 17, 1981, then President Ferdinand Marcos declared that he had “lifted” martial law. There was even an planned attempt to his live but this was thwarted. The crowd numbering in the hundreds of thousands lined the streets from the airport to welcome one of history’s most beloved popes. Journalists would report that this enormous welcome to him was “the most rousing welcome ever given a visiting foreign dignitary that is yet unparalleled in the country’s history.”\n\nOn this visit, Pope John Paul II’s first agenda was to celebrate Mass at Manila Cathedral, after which he expressed to Cardinal Sin his wish for Manila Cathedral to become a basilica, which it happened a few years later.\n\nThe Pope next visited the National Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Baclaran where he met with religious women, and the archbishop’s residence, Villa San Miguel, where he met with the Philippine Episcopate and Asian bishops.\n\nThe following day, the Pope delivered a message at Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City followed by an open air mass in the same city. It was in this mass that Nuestra Señora del Santisimo Rosario – La Naval de Manila was proclaimed as the Queen and Protectress of the Philippines and the whole of Asia and dedicated the Asian continent to the Virgin. The Pontiff blessed the original image the next day in another public Mass. He next addressed the Filipino youth at the University of Santo Tomas, telling them that “The Church is not frightened at the intensity of your feeling. It is a sign of vitality. It indicates pent-up energy, which of itself is neither good nor bad, but can be used for good causes or for bad.”\n\nThe Pope also addressed the poor in Tondo and later proceeded to Manila’s Rizal Park where he beatified Lorenzo Ruiz and other martyrs who were persecuted in Japan in the 17th century – the main purpose of his visit. It was the first beatification outside of Rome in history. After the beatification rites, he unveiled a bronze statue of then Blessed Lorenzo Ruiz as his “gift to the Filipino people” that still stands today. He would later canonize Lorenzo Ruiz and his companion martyrs in 1987 in Rome.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 1981, the Pope flew to Cebu City, where he met with the priests and seminarians of the Sacred Heart Seminary before celebrating a Mass for families at the old Lahug airport in the presence of the original image of Santo Niño de Cebu.\n\nThe following day, the Pope celebrated Mass for the community of Davao City before meeting with representatives of the Muslim community at the Davao airport. On the same day, he met with landowners and workers of sugarcane plantations in the reclaimed area of Bacolod City, as well as with representatives of Catholic organizations in the Cathedral of Jaro in Iloilo province.\n\nIt was on this visit in Jaro that he canonically crowned the image of Nuestra Señora de Candelaria de Jaro at the Cathedral’s balcony. On that same ceremony, the Virgin of the Candles of Jaro was formally declared as the Patroness of Western Visayas. This particular event made “Iloy” (as what Ilonggos called her) the lone Marian image in the country canonically crowned personally by a Pontiff.\n\nOn Feb. 21, 1981, the Pope visited a refugee camp in Morong town, Bataan province, and met with Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian war refugees. He then met with a group of lepers in Tala at Radio Veritas in Manila. Over Radio Veritas, the Pope addressed the other Asian nations that have never had a pontifical visit, among them China, North Korea and Vietnam. His message was a prayer for peace in these nations’ quest for prosperity.\n\nThe Pope later met with representatives of mass media and of other Christian churches in the Philippines and with the labor committees in the Apostolic Nunciature in Manila. The Pope also made a stop to Albay in the Bicol Region and held a Mass for the Farmers outside the Cathedral of St. Gregory the Great. It was in this mass that the original images of Nuestra Señora de Peñafrancia of Naga and Nuestra Señora de Salvacion of Joroan was enthroned at the Papal altar.\n\nPope John Paul II’s last day in the Philippines on Feb. 22, 1981, began in Baguio City with a Mass for indigenous tribes after which farewell ceremonies were held at Manila International Airport.\n\nThe Second visit\n\nThe Pope visited the Philippines once again in January 1995 in time for the 10th World Youth Day. Some 3 million people lined the streets to welcome John Paul II, who arrived on Jan. 12, 1995. “The Filipino people are never far from my mind and heart,” the Pope said on his arrival in January 1995, when cheers of “Mabuhay” and “Viva il Papa” greeted him at the old Manila International Airport. The Polish-born Pontiff was then 74 years old. “Father, look at your children eagerly awaiting the Holy Father,” then Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin said, gesturing toward the costumed schoolchildren who performed folk dances as the Pope’s plane taxied on the runway.\n\nThe five-day visit was the Pope’s first overseas trip after he underwent an artificial bone implant in the leg following a hip injury in April 1994. On his arrival, the Pope addressed the youth and invited them “… to see the world around you with the eyes of Jesus himself! The Gospel says that when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.”\n\nThe following day, the Pontiff met with then President Fidel Ramos at Malacañang and later celebrated Mass for the 233 delegates of the International Youth Forum at Central Seminary Chapel of the UST. He also gave a 20-minute speech to some 200,000 cheering students and academicians gathered at UST Grandstand and Parade Grounds. “I see that it is my great privilege to be here, to be here and discover anew this phenomenon I knew before, and today I know better,” the Pontiff said.\n\nDuring this visit, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass to mark the fourth centenary of the Archdiocese of Manila and the Dioceses of Cebu, Caceres and Nueva Segovia at the Philippine International Convention Center grounds in Pasay City. In a private meeting with members of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, the Pope made the “strongest comments” defending the Catholic ban on artificial contraceptives. He also condemned the injustice in the country and noted the “increasing” gap between rich and poor. “When powerful interests promote policies which are against the moral law inscribed on the human heart, they offend the dignity of man who is made in the image and likeness of God,” the Pontiff said. “In doing so, they undermine the foundations of society itself.”\n\nOn Jan. 15, 1995, a Sunday, the Pope arrived at Malacañang Park aboard the Popemobile from the Apostolic Nunciature on Taft Avenue, but was forced to ride the presidential helicopter along with Cardinal Sin and Papal Nuncio Gian Vincenzo Moreni to get to Quirino Grandstand amid the huge crowd on the streets.\n\nAt past 10 in the morning, the Pope began the three-and-a-half-hour Mass that marked the closing of World Youth Day. Attended by 4 million people, it was the biggest gathering so far in the Pontiff’s 16-year reign. The Mass’ concelebrants included Sin, Cebu Archbishop Ricardo Cardinal Vidal, Vatican Secretary of State Angelo Cardinal Sodano and Eduardo Cardinal Pironio, head of the Pontifical Council of the Laity. It was in this gathering that the song “Tell the World of His Love”, the theme song of this visit, became popular and became a staple church song up to this day.\n\nThe following morning, the Pope left Manila for Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. In his farewell speech before some 10,000 people at the old Manila International Airport, the Pontiff said: “The Pope feels so well in the Philippines that he looks at another opportunity perhaps to return. I take with me a thousand images of the Filipino people.”\n\nThe Supposed Third Visit\n\nThe Pilgrim Pope was supposed to return to the Philippines in 2003 for the Fourth World Meeting of Families yet his deteriorating health prevented this plan to happen yet the event went on with a live telecast from Rome expressing his admiration and love to our people.\n\nHis Death, Beatification and Canonization\n\nOn April 2, 2005, the Beloved Pilgrim Pope passed away because of complications due to Parkinson’s disease. The world was shocked and mourned for his passing. The Filipinos were deeply affected when the news of his death was announced and news coverage of from his death up to his burial was heavily seen in all national media outlets and churches even held memorial masses in his honor.\n\nA few days later after his passing, the Catholic faithful all over the world clamored for his beatification and canonization that on April 28, 2005, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI announced that the normal five-year waiting period before beginning the cause of beatification and canonization would be waived for John Paul II. The cause was officially opened by Cardinal Camillo Ruini, vicar general for the diocese of Rome, on June 28 2005. He was beatified on May 1, 2011 by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and was later Canonized on April 27, 2014 by Pope Francis – both took place on Divine Mercy Sunday which he established in 2000 during the canonization of its visionary St. Faustina Kowalska.\n\nHis Legacy and Impact\n\nThe Legacy and impact of Pope St. John Paul II cannot be denied. Although Pope St. Paul VI began the tradition to Popes traveling overseas, it was during St. John Paul II’s Pontificate that made this activity became a standard which echoes the message of Christ to go and preach to the Gospel to the world. The results was a success, he became reachable to the faithful that the Filipinos appreciate which this act was almost impossible from the past centuries.\n\nHis attempt to personally reach the of Catholics of the world in their countries to speak to them from his heart, to sing and laugh with them, and always, always to invite them to follow Christ, who alone is the fullness of life and happiness. Through his magnanimous interactions with the people, Pope St. John Paul II changed the way people viewed the papacy and inspired numerous vocations to the priesthood and religious life. As a result, he became beloved by many, especially by the Filipino people and the effects can still be felt today as what was mentioned in the introduction.\n\nNow that he is in the rank of the saints in heaven, let us now ask for his intercession for peace in our country and the world and to further strengthen our faith in the midst of division and confusion that we all face today.\n\nSt. John Paul II, we love you and pray for us!\n\nReferences:\n\nAntonio, Rafael, Medina, Mariel, “Pope John Paul II visits to PH” Philippine Daily Inquirer, Retrieved from https://globalnation.inquirer.net/102782/pope-john-paul-iis-visits-to-ph#ixzz6MjvST2kd on May 9, 2020.\n\nSantos, Cora, “John Paul II, the Pope of All Nations”, Word & Life Publications, Makati City, 1995.\n\nSpecial credits to the owners of the photographs used for this blogpost.\n\n+AM+DG+\n\nWhenever we will hear the word “Fatima”, initially we will immediately recognize a beautiful image of the Blessed Virgin Mary all in white with gold trimmings in her dress and veil, a golden rosary and the Star of Esther at her feet who appeared to the three shepherd children in 1917. Interestingly, whenever we hear her title or see her image, we immediately recall her most popular message to pray the rosary everyday along with it’s famous secrets, especially the highly debated “Third Secret”.\n\nDespite of all these things that we associate to the Virgin of the Rosary of Fatima, are we truly aware of the core messages and lessons that Our Lady imparted to us through her children, aside from those points mentioned? Most of us know the events of 1917 at the Cova de Iria, yet very few wondered what happened afterwards. Surprsingly, in my years of reading Fatima related literature, it made me realize that there were more key events post 1917 that further gave understanding on the messages of the Virgin in Fatima that I do think the faithful must know so that we can fully grasp what is she really trying to say to the world in order for us to convert back to God and stop offending Him anymore.\n\nAs we are about to do a National Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on her feast day, May 13, 2020 led by our bishops and some City mayors in the country (in the case of the Archdiocese of Manila), we have to uncover these post 1917 events to give us a greater understanding on what Fatima was really all about and how her messages are very crucial in our society at this present time of division, confusion and uncertainty.\n\nFor this case, we will begin this special feature from the Miracle of the Sun followed by the life of the three shepherd children after the Fatima events and the subsequent apparitions to Sister Lucia dos Santos that would further emphasize the importance of the Fatima messages in modern times.\n\nThe Miracle of the Sun\n\nThe famed Miracle of the Sun took place on October 13, 1917, Lucia revealed the following details that on this event: “Our Lady having disappeared in the immensity of the firmament, we saw, beside the sun, Saint Joseph with the Child Jesus and Our Lady clothed in white with a blue mantle. Saint Joseph and the Child Jesus seemed to bless the world with gestures which they made with their hands in the form of a cross. Soon after, that apparition having ceased, I saw Our Lord and Our Lady, Who gave me the impression of being Our Lady of Sorrows. Our Lord seemed to bless the world in the same manner as Saint Joseph. That apparition disappeared and it seemed to me that I saw Our Lady again, this time as Our Lady of Mount Carmel.”\n\nFr. Donald Calloway, MIC, in his book “Consecration to St. Joseph”, he noted that the mere fact that St. Joseph appeared during the Miracle of the Sun, it shows that St. Joseph plays an important role to hasten the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The significance of Jesus appearing as a child and blessing the world with St. Joseph cannot be underestimated. The message of Fatima has great significance for our times. Sister Lucia, the longest-lived visionary of the Fatima apparitions, stated that the final battle between good and evil would be over marriage and the family. Heaven taught us on October 13, 1917 that Jesus works miracles, gives peace, and blesses the world through St. Joseph.\n\nThe Life of the Three Shepherd Children after 1917\n\nAfter the apparitions, the children seemed that they can no longer go back to their peaceful lives since pilgrims wanted to speak to them about the apparitions that they felt exaspirated at some point, yet they are obliged to accept prayer requests and numerous miracles occured through their prayers. Francisco and Jacinta died separately a year after the apparitons as prophecies by Virgin in the June 13, 1917 apparition.\n\nFrancisco spent the remaining years of his life consoling Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament who was outraged by mankind’s indiference. Francisco died of Spanish influenza on April 4, 1919. Jacinta on the other hand suffered much longer and was hospitalized twice and died alone in a hostpital in Lisbon on February 20, 1920. During Jacinta’s suffering, she did not complained for the sake of the conversion of sinners.\n\nThe Virgin often visited Jacinta during her suffering and revealed much more about the need of prayer and conversion before it is too late along with a few messages that was given to her which we will quote for one’s discernment and reflection:\n\n“It is necessary to do penance. If people change their ways, Our Lord will still spare the world; but if they do not, the chastisement will come.”\n\n“Pray much for for those who govern! Work to those who persecute the religion of Our Lord! If the government were to leave the Church at peace and give freedom to the holy faith, it would be blessed by God.”\n\n“The sins that lead more souls to hell are the sins of the flesh.”\n\n“Fashions that will greatly offend Our Lord will appear.”\n\n“People who serve God should not follow fashions. The Church has no fashions, Our Lord is always the same.”\n\n“Many marriages are not good: they do not please Our Lord and they are not from God.”\n\n“Those who do not keep the promises they make to Our Lady will never succeed in their affairs.”\n\nFrancisco and Jacinta Marto were beatified in 2000 by Pope St. John Paul II at the Basilica of Fatima, with Sister Lucia in attendance at that time, and were later canonized on May 13, 2017 – the centenary of the Fatima Apparitions by Pope Francis at the same Basilica. The Marto visionaries’ feast day is celebrated every February 20.\n\nLucia dos Santos first entered the Dorothean sisters in 1925 by the request of the Bishop of Leiria, Fatima and received education from the said order. The Bishop also ordered her to change her name from Lucia to Maria das Dores to protect her privacy which she willingly accepted. She later requested to be transferred to the Order of the Discalced Carmelites in Coimbra, Portugal in 1948 for she wanted to be at peace not being bothered by visitors and took the name Sister Lucia of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. It was during these times that she worked on the spread of the devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and to request for the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nShe died on February 13, 2005 and she was later declared Servant of God after the five year waiting period was waived to open the cause for her beatification and canonization.\n\nThe Pontevedra apparition\n\nWhen Lucia became a Dorothean sister, Our Lady did not forget her word on her mission to spread the devotion to her Immaculate Heart. On December 10, 1925, six years after the last apparitions in Fatima, Portugal, the Child Jesus and the Blessed Mother appeared to her again in Spain, in the Dorothean Convent of Pontevedra. The most holy Virgin rested her hand on Lucia’s shoulder, and as she did so, she showed her a heart encircled by thorns, which she was holding in her other hand. At the same time, the Child Jesus said: “Have compassion on the Heart of your most holy Mother, covered with thorns, with which ungrateful men pierce it at every moment, and there is no one to make an act of reparation to remove them”.\n\nThen the most holy Virgin requested the devotion of the Five First Saturday. The request consisted in: praying the Rosary, meditating on the mysteries of the Rosary, confessing and receiving Holy Communion, in reparation for the sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nEncounter with the Child Jesus\n\nDuring this time, Sister Lucia was troubled because of the questions regarding the Five First Saturday devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. It was during those times that on February 15, 1926, the Child Jesus appeared to Lucia again, asking her if she had already spread the devotion to his most holy Mother. Lucia placed before Jesus the difficulty that some people had about confessing on Saturday, and asked that it might be valid to go to Confession within eight days.\n\nJesus answered: “Yes, and it could be longer still, provided that, when they receive Me, they are in the state of grace and have intention of making reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary”. Asked about those who forget to make this intention, Jesus replied: “They can do so at their next Confession, taking advantage of the first opportunity to go to Confession”.\n\nThe Five First Saturday devotion\n\nSister Lucia also received from Our Lord the explanation on why only Five First Saturdays, and not nine or seven in honor of the Seven Sorrows of Mary:\n\n“My daughter, the motive is simple: there are five ways in which people offend and blaspheme against the Immaculate Heart of Mary:\n\nThe blasphemies against the Immaculate Conception,\n\nAgainst her virginity\n\nAgainst the Divine Maternity, refusing at the same time to accept her as the Mother of all mankind.\n\nThose who try publicly to implant in the children’s hearts indifference, contempt, and even hatred against this Immaculate Mother, and\n\nThose who insult her directly in her sacred images.\n\nThe elements of this devotion, therefore, consist in the following four points, all of which must be offered in reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. One should make this intention before carrying out Our Lady’s requests. A renewal of the actual intention at the time is best; however, if such an intention is made now, it will fulfill the requirements if, for instance, the actual intention is forgotten at the time of confession.\n\nConfession – This confession can be made before the First Saturday or afterward, provided that Holy Communion be received in the state of grace. In 1926, Christ in a vision explained to Lucia that this confession could be made a week before or even more, and that it should be offered in reparation.\n\nHoly Communion – Before receiving Holy Communion, it is likewise necessary to offer it in reparation to Our Lady. Our Lord told Lucia in 1930, “This Communion will be accepted on the following Sunday for just reasons, if my priests allow it so.” So if work or school, sickness, or another just reason prevents the Communion on a First Saturday, with this permission it may be received the following Sunday. If Communion is transferred, any or all of the other acts of the devotion may also be performed on Sunday if the person so desires.\n\nRosary – The Rosary is a vocal prayer said while meditating upon the mysteries of Our Lord’s life and Passion and Our Lady’s life. To comply with the request of our Blessed Mother, it must be offered in reparation and said properly while meditating.\n\n15-minute meditation – Also offered in reparation, the meditation may embrace one or more mysteries; it may include all, taken together or separately. This meditation should be the richest of any meditation, because Our Lady promised to be present when she said “…those who keep me company….”\n\nTo those who faithfully follow Our Lady’s requests for the Five First Saturdays, she has made a wonderful promise which she, as Mediatrix of All Graces, will certainly fulfill: “I promise to assist at the hour of death with the graces necessary for salvation.” This means that our Blessed Mother will be present at the hour of death with the actual grace of final perseverance, is the most important grace.\n\nAfter completing the Five First Saturdays, one may continue the devotion simply to console the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady. A tender love of our Blessed Mother will lead one to do all he can to make reparation for the sins which pierce her Immaculate Heart. Let us remember, too, that although Our Lady made this promise to those who would observe five such First Saturdays in succession, in her July apparition she asked simply that Communions of reparation be made on every First Saturday to atone for the sins of the world.\n\nAn interesting addition to this, Sister Lucia revealed in an interview in 1950 that “The rosary and brown scapular are inseparable. You cannot have one without the other.” she would later go on that “Wearing the Brown Scapular is a sign of Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.” During the Miracle of the Sun, Sister Lucia saw the Blessed Mother as Our Lady of Mount Carmel holding in her right hand the brown scapular. Sister Lucia would later affirm that the scapular is integral to the original message. Just as the Virgin Mary asks each of us to pray the rosary every day, so too, according to Sister Lucia, does Mary want us to wear the brown scapular. This is why she was holding the brown scapular in the vision, as if asking us to take it and wear it.\n\nThe Tuy apparition\n\nA few years later, on June 13, 1929, Sister Lucia recounts that while she was praying in their chapel in Tuy, Spain, she suddenly saw the chapel was illuminated with supernatural light and above the altar appeared a cross of light, reaching to the ceiling. In a brighter light on the upper part of the cross, could be seen the face of a man and his body as far as the waist; upon his breast was a dove of light; nailed to the cross was the body of another man. A little below the waist, I could see a chalice and a large host suspended in the air, on to which drops of blood were falling from the face of Jesus Crucified and from the wound in His side. These drops ran down on to the host and fell into the challice. Beneath the right arm of the cross was Our Lady and in her hand was her Immaculate Heart. Under the left arm of the cross, large letters, -as if of crystal clear water which ran down upon the altar, formed these words: “Grace and Mercy”. I understood that it was the Mystery of the Most Holy Trinity which was shown to me, and I received lights about this mystery which I am not permitted to reveal.\n\nOur Lady then said to me: “The moment has come in which God asks the Holy Father, in union with all the Bishops of the world, to make the consecration of Russia to my Immaculate Heart, promising to save it by this means. There are so many souls whom the justice of God condemns for sins committed against me, that I have come to ask reparation: sacrifice yourself for this intention and pray.”\n\nIn the months following the Church’s official recognition and approval given to the Fatima Apparitions by Bishop José da Silva on October 13, 1930, Sister Lucy was overwhelmed with inquiries and attention, to the extent that her health was threatened. In order to give her some needed rest, she was sent to stay for a short time in the home of her Mother Superior’s blood-sister in Rianjo, a small coastal city in Spain. No one in the town or even in that home, with the exception of Mother Superior’s sister, knew of Sister Lucy’s identity as the Fatima visionary.\n\nThe Rianjo apparition\n\nThus it happened that on an unspecified day in August 1931, Sister Lucy was in the town’s chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, praying fervently for the conversion of Russia. It had been already two years and two months since Heaven’s formal and dramatic request was given in the Trinitarian vision at Tuy, for the Pope and all of the Catholic bishops of the world to consecrate Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary — receiving virtually no response from the Church’s hierarchy.\n\nIt was during this time that Our Lord appeared to her and complained of His ministers’ delay in executing His command, warning them at the same time of the terrible fate awaiting them on account of their disobedience:\n\n“‘You console Me a great deal in asking Me for the conversion of those poor nations: Request it also of My Mother, while saying to Her often: Sweet Heart of Mary, be the salvation of Russia, Spain, Portugal, Europe and the whole world. At other times say: By Thy Pure and Immaculate Conception, O Mary, obtain for me the conversion of Russia, Spain, Portugal, Europe and the whole world.\n\nMake it known to My ministers, given that they follow the example of the King of France in delaying the execution of My command, they will likewise follow him into misfortune. It is never too late to have recourse to Jesus and Mary.\n\nThey did not wish to heed My request! Like the King of France they will repent of it, and they will do it, but it will be late. Russia will have already spread its errors in the world, provoking wars and persecutions against the Church. The Holy Father will have much to suffer.’”\n\nOur Lord was here making an explicit reference to the request of the Sacred Heart given through Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque on June 17, 1689 to the King of France, to consecrate France to His Sacred Heart, promising in return to save France from its enemies. As a result of the refusal of the Kings of France — Louis XIV, Louis XV, and Louis XVI — (following the unfortunate and unworthy advice of their Jesuit confessors) to perform this consecration, the French monarchy and the whole of France’s Catholic society was overthrown by the Protestant and Masonic Counter-Church’s plots in the course of the bloody terror of the French Revolution.\n\nOn June 17, 1789, (the Feast of the Sacred Heart) exactly one hundred years to the day from when Saint Margaret Mary had been given that revelation of the great designs of Heaven for France, the Third Estate rose up and proclaimed itself the National Assembly, stripping King Louis XVI of his legislative authority. A mere four years later, on January 21, 1793, the revolutionaries sent the King to his death on the guillotine as if he were a common criminal.\n\nAt Rianjo, Jesus warns us that this dark chapter of history will repeat itself, and this time the ministers of His Church will be prominent among its hapless victims.\n\nInterestingly, at the same time, Our Lord Jesus would later communicate this to Blessed Alexandrina de Costa, a paralytic Portuguese mystic, the same request to compel the Pope to consecrate Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Both Sister Lucia and Blessed Alexandrina wrote to Pope Pius XII regarding this request and he later performed the “consecration of the Church and of the human race”on October 32, 1942. The following year, Lucia revealed in her letter to the Archbishop of Valladolid that Our Lord said to her that he promised to end the Second World War on the account of the the consecration the Pontiff made, yet the conversion of Russia will be delayed since it was not done as what Our Lady clearly instructed. From there, the succeeding Popes did the same, most recently by Pope St. John Paul II on March 25, 1984.\n\nLearnings\n\nThe key messages of the Lady of Fatima, namely prayer, especially the Holy Rosary as an instrument of peace throughout the world; living chastely in one’s state of life to avoid hell; Eucharistic reparation for all the blasphemies Our Lord and Our Lady received from the people; the devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by means of the Five First Saturdays as an act of reparation and consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. We have to always keep in mind her words for she cares for all of us for she is our Mother so that before the Day of Judgement, we will enjoy the eternal paradise that her Son Jesus promised, if we will strive to do good on earth.\n\nAs what we’ve discussed in this blog, we discovered numerous events that seemed little to some yet they played a bigger role in understanding the message of Our Lady of Fatima to mankind in these modern times. Time and time again, her call for prayer and conversion is timeless and important for it will help us in the way we should live our life – a life confirming to God’s own will. We should not take the messages of Our Lady for granted, especially in these dark times where both the Church and the society are in it’s trying times and we need a Mother to help us in our way back to God.\n\nOur Lady of the Holy Rosary of Fatima, Pray for us!\n\nReferences:\n\nBorelli, Antonio, “Our Lady of Fatima: Prophecies of Tragedy or Hope”, The Philippine Crusade for the Defense of Christian Civilization Inc., Makati City, 2016.\n\nCalloway, Donald, “Consecration to St. Joseph”, Marians of the Immaculate, Ohio, 2020.\n\ndos Santos, Lucia, “Fatima in Lucia’s own words”, Porto, Portugal, 1973,\n\n“Our Lady of Fatima, Our Mother Comes to Us”, Pilgrim Virgin Committee, Ausbury, New Jersey, 2005.\n\nThe early part of 2020 became one of the most devastating for the books because it was during this period that the a new deadly virus was detected, the COVID-19 or more popularly known as corona virus that came from China that is spreading rapidly throughout the world in breakneck speed. Unfortunately, the Philippines was one of the countries that were affected and the number of cases are rising at an alarming rate. The Philippine Catholic Church became wary on the situation that the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines issued cautionary measures and dispensations for the safety of the faithfula side from the issuance of an oratio imperata for this cause.\n\nIn this blogpost, we are going look on some pages from our Church history to know how the faithful cope and acted with such health issue and most specifically, the intervention of some of the country’s Patrons and Protectors that spared them from such pestilence in their locality that further help strengthen their respective cultus that in some cases led to official Church recognition and/or grand celebration of their festivities.\n\nSaints as advocates against plagues and pestilence\n\nIn Medieval and Early Modern Europe. widespread suffering from the plague epidemics and general pestilence are rampant and the Church provided ample opportunity to help the faithful aside from administering the victims of plague epidemics, there are the introduction of numerous penitential acts from penitential processions, public scourging of penitents and religious, the formation of different confraternities and sodalities intended for this purpose, notably the Cofradia de la Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion y Correa of the Augustinians that was later established in the Philippines and establish an asylum for those who got cholera morbo.\n\nAnother method and perhaps the most popular are the propagation of devotions to some saints that are known to heal the sick and treat the terminally ill. Sufferers commonly prayed to the saints to intercede for them and proven to be effective that would led to the popularity of their cultus and sprung more pious acts in order to appease God to end plague epidemics.\n\nSaints against plague epidemics\n\nIn the course of our Church history, numerous saints were invoked and performed miracles that help stop the ravages of plague epidemics and their cultus grew over the centuries. It is also worth mentioning that some there were some saints who lived during the times of plagues who fearlessly helped the plague victims, risking their lives in the name of charity like St. Charles Borromeo and St. Aloysius Gonzaga.\n\nThe Fourteen Holy Helpers\n\nThe Fourteen Holy Helpers are a group of saints venerated together because their intercession is particularly effective, especially against various diseases and epidemics. This group of saints originated in the 14th century at first in the Rhineland, largely as a result of the bubonic plague that became known as the Black Death. Popular veneration of these saints often began in a monastery that held their relics. All of the saints, except St. Giles, were accounted martyrs.\n\nAmong the saints that are invoked as special patrons, in time of certain diseases, are these fourteen:\n\nSt. George (Feast: April 23), soldier-martyr. Invoked for protection for domestic animals and against herpetic diseases. He is depicted striking down a dragon.\n\nSt. Blaise (Feast: February 3), bishop and martyr. He is invoked against diseases of the throat. St. Blaise is shown with two crossed candles.\n\nSt. Erasmus (Feast: June 2), bishop and martyr. He is invoked against diseases of the stomach and intestine, protection for domestic animals and patron of sailors. He is pictured with his entrails wound around a windlass.\n\nSt. Pantaleon (Feast: July 27), martyr. Invoked against consumption, protection for domestic animals and patron of physicians and midwives. He is pictured with his hands nailed together.\n\nSt. Vitus (Feast: June 15), martyr. Invoked in epilepsy, chorea, lethargy, and the bites of poisonous or mad animals and against storms. Also protection for domestic animals. Patron of dancer and actors. St. Vitus is pictured with his cross.\n\nSt. Christopher (Feast: July 25), martyr. Invoked against the plague and sudden death. He is the patron of travelers, especially motorists, and is also invoked in storms. Usually pictured carrying the Child Jesus on his shoulder.\n\nSt. Denis (Feast: October 9), bishop and martyr. Invoked against diabolical possession and headaches. Pictured carrying his head in his hands.\n\nSt. Cyriacus (Feast: August 3), deacon and martyr. Invoked against diseases of the eye and diabolical possession. Also interceded for those in temptation, especially at the time of death. He is usually pictured as vested as a deacon.\n\nSt. Acathius (Feast: May 3), martyr. Invoked against headaches and at the time of death’s agony. He is pictured with a crown of thorns.\n\nSt. Eustace (Feast: September 20), martyr. Invoked against fire — temporal and eternal. Patron of hunters. Patron in all kinds of difficulties, and invoked in family troubles. Pictured with a stag and hunting equipment.\n\nSt. Giles (Feast: September 1), hermit and abbot. Invoked against the plague, panic, epilepsy, madness, and nightmares and for a good confession. Patron of cripples, beggars, and breastfeeding mothers. He is pictured in a monastic cowl with a deer.\n\nSt. Margaret of Antioch (Feast: July 20), virgin and martyr. Invoked against backache. Patron for women in childbirth. She is pictured holding a dragon in chains.\n\nSt. Catherine of Alexandria (Feast: November 25), virgin and martyr. Invoked against diseases of the tongue, protection against a sudden and unprovided death. She is pictured with a broken wheel.\n\nSt. Barbara (Feast: December 4), virgin and martyr. Invoked against fever, lightning, fire and sudden death. Patron of builders, artillerymen and miners. St. Barbara is pictured with a tower and ciborium with a host above it.\n\nOver the centuries, these fourteen Saints have been depicted in religious art with the symbols of their martyrdom. There were churches in Europe dedicated to them and became pilgrimage sites. The traditional feast of the Fourteen Holy Helpers was then celebrated every August 8.\n\nIn the Philippines, though the devotion to the Fourteen Holy Helpers was not that known, there were some churches, chapels and niches dedicated to at least four of them and gained much devotional following over the centuries. Most notable of these are Santa Barbara, venerated in Iloilo and Pangasinan, San Blas of Sebaste, Antique, Santa Catalina de Alenjandria in La Union, Carcar, Cebu and Pampanga, San Dionisio in his chapel in Barangay San Dionisio, Parañaque and San Cristobal in La Union and Paete, Laguna.\n\nIn the case of San Cristobal of Paete, Laguna, although he was known due to the two paintings that were hanged near the entrance of the centuries old St. James the Great Parish in Paete, Laguna. There was an old tradition that images of Saint Christopher should be placed near the entrance of residences, business establishments and churches or on the north facing the entrance, or located in such a way as to be in full view of the faithful because of a belief that anyone who sees and image of the saint will not die on that day.\n\nIn our country, there were several saints that are invoked in times of pestilence and plagues and their intercession was proven with miracles attributed to their intercession.\n\nSan Rafael Arcangel\n\nOne of the three Archangels mentioned in Sacred Scripture, St Raphael is “one of the seven who stand before the Lord” (Tobit 12:15). His name means, “God heals”. St. Raphael is best known for his appearance in the book of Tobit, in which, disguised as a human, he aids the young Tobiah on a journey to Media. On this journey, St Raphael liberates Sarah, Tobiah’s betrothed, from a demon who killed her seven previous husbands on their wedding night. Upon their return, he heals Tobiah’s father Tobit of his blindness. Due to his role of healing in the Book of Tobit, St. Raphael is traditionally attributed as the Angel of the Lord who moves the healing waters of the pool of Bethsaida.\n\nHe is also the heavenly patron of the blind, against nightmares, of happy meetings, nurses, doctors, travelers and invoked against plagues. One instance of his intercession against plagues happened in Cordoba, Spain where the devotion to Saint Raphael the Archangel spread following the plague that ravaged the city beginning in 1649. The devotion to San Rafael Arcangel was brought to our country by the Spanish friars during the Spanish colonization era and numerous parishes are dedicated to San Rafael, most notably in Calaca, Batangas were the miraculous black image of San Rafael is enshrined and known for averting plagues and disasters, most recently the image was brought out of his shrine for deliverance rites during the violent Taal volcano eruption and cessation of the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nSan Miguel Arcangel\n\nSan Miguel Arcangel is known as the chief of the Archangels and Prince of the Heavenly Host. St. Michael has four main responsibilities or offices, as we know from scripture and Christian tradition: The first is to combat Satan, The second is to escort the faithful to heaven at their hour of death, The third is to be a champion of all Christians, and the Church itself. And the fourth is to call men from life on Earth to their heavenly judgment.\n\nIn the history of the Catholic Church, the intervention of St. Michael the Archangel against plagues were also sought after on two separate occasions that took place on the same date, April 25 in 590 in Rome and in 1631 in Tlaxcala, Mexico.\n\nThe first apparition took place on April 25, 590 when Pope St. Gregory the Great held a penitential procession to end the plague that claimed the lives of many in Europe. In the procession, they brought out the miraculous icon of Salus Populi Romani and sung the Litany of the Saints to appease God to end the deadly plague. It was then that the Blessed Virgin Mary, along with the angels headed by St. Michael the Archangel appeared and sung the “Regina Coeli” and Pope St. Gregory added the lines: “Ora pro nobis Deum, alleluia! Gaude et lætare, Virgo Maria, alleluia! Quia surrexit Dominus vere, alleluia.” [Pray for us to God, alleluia! Rejoice and be glad, O Virgin Mary, alleluia! For the Lord has truly risen, alleluia!]. At the conclusion of the vision, the great pope witnessed Saint Michael sheathing his sword, and to the great joy of all the inhabitants, the horrific plague came to an end. The beautiful Church called Castel Sant’Angelo stands at the site where Saint Michael and his fellow angels had appeared on that day along with the Blessed Virgin Mary. April 25 became the Feast of the Great Litanies (which also shares with the Feast of St. Mark the Evangelist) where the Litany of the Saints\n\n1040 years later, in 1631, a century after the great apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe to St. Juan Diego, Mexico was suffering from the plague where the victims were afflicted with “cocolixtli” by the locals, was a horrible form of smallpox that was devastating the people with immense sufferings and numerous deaths. The Mexican faithful then performed the same rites that took place in Rome in 590 from holding a penitential procession, the singing and praying of the Litany of the Saints. After the Litany was sung, the St. Michael appeared to a native Indian named Diego Lázaro de San Francisco and told him that he will find “a miraculous spring of water that will cure the people of their ills.” The Archangel further instructed Diego not to doubt and neglect the instruction. Diego was initally overwhelmed with the vision but when he asked the people arou d if they also saw the vision, he found out that he was the only who beheld the vision. Confused, Diego thought perhaps he imagined the whole encounter, and he decided not to tell anyone about his experience yet St. Michael was not pleased and he was stricken with the plague.\n\nJust when those around Diego were convinced that he was passing from this life, St. Michael intervened once again. This time, everyone present saw a dazzling light, which scared them tremendously, causing them all to flee from the hut. St. Michael later guided Diego to the mountain to locate the miraculous spring and the people followed Diego and was able to find the miraculous spring and he was suddenly cured of the plague. Soon afterwards, the people who got infected with the plague were also cured when they went to the spring and the devotion to San Miguel del Milagro began and the apparitions were later approved in 1643.\n\nIt was due to these two reported apparitions that St. Michael was also invoked against plague epidemics. In our country, St. Michael enjoyed much devotion especially in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte; Marilao and San Miguel, Bulacan; San Miguel, Manila (where the National Shrine is located); Argao, Cebu and a Minor Basilica in Tayabas, Quezon among others.\n\nSan Sebastian\n\nSt. Sebastian was one of the earliest saints known as advocate against plagues. St. Sebastian was born in Gaul, went to Rome, and joined the army, later becoming a captain under Diocletian. When it was discovered that he was a Christian who had converted many soldiers, Sebastian was ordered to be killed by arrows. The archers left him for dead, but a Christian widow nursed him back to health. He then presented himself before Diocletian, who condemned him to death by beating. His body, thrown into a sewer, was found by another pious woman, who dreamed that Sebastian told her to bury his remains near the catacombs. His relics are believed to be in the Basilica of San Sebastiano on the Appian Way, to which many pilgrims were attracted in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe belief that Saint Sebastian was a defense against the plague was a medieval addition to his reputation, which largely accounts for the enormous increase in his importance in the Late Middle Ages. The connection of the martyr shot with arrows with the plague is not an intuitive one. In Greco-Roman myth, Apollo, the archer god, at times destroys his enemies by shooting plague-arrows from the heavens, but is also the deliverer from pestilence; the figure of Sebastian Christianizes this folkloric association.\n\nVisually, “the arrow wounds call to God for mercy to us, as the symptoms of the unfirm call for pity from the passerby” In 680, Rome was freed from a raging pestilence through his intercession. Another episode of a great plague that afflicted the Lombards in the time of King Gumburt, which was stopped by the erection of an altar in honor of Sebastian in the Church of Saint Peter in the Province of Pavia. The devotion to St. Sebastian also gained devotional following in the Philippines with numerous churches and chapels were dedicated to him, most notably in Lumban and Famy, Laguna, Pinagbuhatan, Pasig City and most famous of them is the Minor Basilica of San Sebastian in Plaza del Carmen, Quiapo, Manila.\n\nSan Roque\n\nSan Roque arguably is the most popular saint against plagues and his cultus grown around the world because of his avocation. San Roque or St. Roch of Montpelier was born in Montpelier, France to a wealthy parents where his father is the governor of the place. He was orphaned when he was twenty and he later entered the Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi. He went on pilgrimage to Rome and devoted himself to caring for the victims of a plague that was ravaging Italy. He became a victim himself at Piacenza but recovered and was reputed to have performed many miracles of healing. On his return to Montpellier, he was imprisoned for five years for he was suspected as a spy in pilgrim’s disguise by his uncle, who was governor. (His uncle failed to recognize him, and Roch failed to identify himself.) Roch died in prison and was only then identified as the former governor’s son by a birthmark in the form of a cross on his chest.\n\nWhen miracles were reported at his intercession after his death, a popular cult developed and he is invoked against pestilence and plague. He is also the patron of invalids. His feast day is August 16. The cult of San Roque soon became more popular when a plague struck in his hometown, an angel appeared to the tomb of the saint and brought a scroll that reads: “Those who were wounded with plague, implore the favor of Roque, will attain health.” and the people began invoking the saint against plagues and soon, the plague suddenly vanished. It was through this miracle that the faithful began to ask his intercession to avert plagues up to the present day. In the Philippines, the cultus of San Roque enjoyed much popularity that numerous churches and chapels were established up to this day most notably in Caloocan City, Sta. Mesa and Blumentritt, Manila, Pateros City, Muntinlupa City, Cavite among others.\n\nIn light of the recent spread of the corona virus, the Church encourages prayers and novenas to be held in honor of San Roque to invoke once again his powerful intercession to cease the epidemic from spreading. In some locations like in his Cathedral in Caloocan City, Pateros City and some chapels that are dedicated to San Roque or to penitential processions that with his image included.\n\nSan Vicente Ferrer\n\nSan Vicente Ferrer is one of the famed Dominican saints throughout the world, especially in Spain and its colonies and his invoked as well against plagues aside from being a thaumaturgist. St. Vincent Ferrer was in Spain in 1350, he received the Dominican habit at the age of seventeen. In his turbulent epoch, he was an angel of peace, preaching the word of God with special stress on penance and the Last Judgement. He was outstanding for the gift of prophecy, worked astonishing miracles and brought back thousand to the practice of their faith. Although he preached in his own native tongue to people who spoke different languages, he was clearly understood by all because of his extraordinary Gift of Tongues. The Saint spent the last three years of his life in France and died at Vannes, Brittany on April 5, 1419. Pope Calixtus III canonized him in 1455.\n\nSt. Vincent is was one of the saints that is invoked against plagues because he lived during the times of the black plague. It was during those times that not only he preached, he also took care of the sick who were afflicted by the plague. While studying at Barcelona and only in Deacon’s orders he was bidden to preach. Famine and plague were raging. The ships sent from Flanders with corn had not arrived and the people were in despair. Vincent organized a procession, and in the Place del Boru preached to some 20,000 persons. The spirit of prophecy came upon him and he foretold that before nightfall the overdue ships should arrive. When he returned to the convent, a crowd of people rushed to the Convent, exultant, delirious with joy: the corn-laden ships had arrived and Vincent’s prophecy was fulfilled.\n\nAfter his death and canonization, devotion to St. Vincent Ferrer flourished and he was also invoked against plagues, next to San Roque and also enjoyed much devotional following in the Philippines when the Dominicans and interestingly the Augustinian Recollect Friars propagated the devotion in Luzon and in Visayas respectively. Numerous altars, churches, chaples and shrines were erected in his honor, especially in Cebu, Pangasinan, Laguna, Batangas among others.\n\nDuring the Colonial and Pre-War years, the devotion also enjoyed a following in Manila, especially in Binondo and in the Walled City of Intramuros. In Binondo, Mondays were once dedicated to San Vicente Ferrer and devotees used to flock Binondo Church to fulfill their devotions to the saint. In Intramuros, the famed and surviving processional image of the saint that joins the La Naval de Manila processions used to have its own altar with votive offerings in the Old Santo Domingo Church. There was this old custom that the hand of the image is detached and brought to the sick, especially to the patients in San Juan de Dios Hospital (then in Intramuros) for veneration.\n\nOur Lord gives his aid and protection\n\nIt is known to our Catholic faith that Our Lord Jesus Christ heals the sick and he did different means to cure people in his lifetime, even after his Ascension to heaven. Aside from His Eucharistic presence, Our Lord would also utilizes his image as instruments of miracles and there were some records in our Church history that there were images of Christ that believed to have performed miracles that ended plague epidemics that led to grand celebrations of feast days to commemorate these miracles.\n\nEl Divino Rostro de Naga\n\nThe image of El Divino Rostro de Naga is the famed companion of Nuestra Señora de Peñafrancia de Naga and the two images are always inseparable. The devotion to El Divino Rostro de Naga began when a replica of the image from Osa de Vega, Spain was brought by Rev. Fr. Pedro de la Torre, then named Provisor and Vicar General of the Diocese of Nueva Ceceres came to Naga. The picture was exposed to the piety of the inhabitants of the town and after a lapse of years, it became very popular.\n\nIn 1882, the “cholera morbo” broke out in Manila and it spread in other provinces, including Nueva Ceceres. A votive novena was held to stop the plague from causing more harm to the people and the image of Nuestra Señora de Peñafrancia was brought to Naga Cathedral from her shrine. Fr. Pedro de la Torre remembered a similar catastrophe in Osa de la Vega and the miraculous intervention of the Divino Rostro. Fr. De la Torre made this miracle known to the people in Naga. The replica of the Divino Rostro was brought to the Cathedral for special prayers and devotion, imploring for the same prayers and mercy that was long ago shown. Bishop Casimiro Herrera with his priests then made a promise, should the dreadful disease spare Naga, the Divino Rostro will be pompously venerated with special festivities together with the Virgin of Peñafrancia. Fr. Pedro de la Torre decided to donate the image to the Sanctuario of Peñafrancia and the image can now be seen at he Basilica Minore of Muestra Señora de Peñafrancia in Naga, Camarines Sur.\n\nSanto Niño de Pasion de Makati\n\nThe devotion to the Santo Niño de Pasion was introduced to the Parish of Saints Peter and Paul in the old San Pedro de Macati (now Makati City) in 1885 thru the efforts of Fr. Manuel Marco. The devotion to the Sorrowing Child of Makati gradually became known throughout San Pedro de Makati.\n\nThe devotion to the sorrowing Child reached its peak when an epidemic hit the pueblo and the people immediately asked for the help of the Niño to spare them from the epidemic that was killing hundreds at that time. The Sorrowing Child did not turn a deaf ear and the epidemic suddenly disappeared that saved the old pueblo. With this particular miracle, his feast day was celebrated with much pomp and solemnity throughout Makati for centuries and the devotion became widespread.\n\nThe Feast of the Santo Niño de Pasion was formerly celebrated first during Septuagesima Sunday (Three Sundays before First Sunday of Lent) in the Tridentine Calendar, then later moved to Sunday after Ash Wednesday with the reforms of the Liturgical Calendar in the Second Vatican Council and finally moved to its current feast every Second Sunday of Lent. On the novena days, the Dalit to the Santo Niño de Pasion is recited or sung which recounts his meditations on his early life and the Passion that he will face in the future and as well as a supplication for his continues protection to the city.\n\nSanto Niño de Tacloban\n\nThe famed Santo Niño de Tacloban is one of the most revered images of the Child Jesus in the province of Leyte and it feast is celebrated every June 30, aside from its liturgical feast every Third Sunday of January. The history of the miraculous Señor Sto. Niño de Tacloban explains the change in the date of the celebration of the feast of the beloved patron. When the image of the Señor Sto. Niño de Tacloban got lost in its voyage back from Manila to Tacloban for repair, a cholera epidemic ensued. That was weeks before the January feast of the patron then. The miracle was when the icon was retrieved from Semirara Island in Caluya, Antique, months after it got lost offshore and was returned to Tacloban on June 30, the cholera epidemic ended.\n\nThis prompted the devotees to celebrate the feast of Señor Sto. Niño on June 30. Then in the 1960’s by virtue of a decree of then Bishop Teotimo Pacis, the Señor Sto. Niño de Tacloban became the patron as well of the entire province of Leyte.\n\nMary as advocate against plagues and pestilence\n\nDuring times of plague, the Blessed Mother helped on averting plagues in myriad of ways, one of them, and probably the most significant was when she gave the Miraculous Medal thru St. Catherine Laboure in a vision and it was greatly distributed in 1832 when a cholera epidemic hit France. It is said that those who were stricken with the plague who wore the medal with confidence were miraculously healed, hence the medal, originally known as the Medal of the Immaculate Conception, became popularly known as the Miraculous Medal.\n\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary is known as the Principal Patroness of the Philippines under the title of the Immaculate Conception since the Spanish regime. Her patronage over the islands became providential because she clearly manifested herself through numerous miracles that she wroght to her devotees in different parts of the country, including aversion of plague epidemics that raveged the country up to this day. It was through these miracles that the Filipino people became staunch devotees of the Blessed Virgin and gained the name “Pueblo Amante de Maria”.\n\nNuestra Señora de la Paz y Buen Viaje\n\nThe image of Nuestra Señora de la Paz y Buen Viaje, venerated in her National Shrine and Cathedral of Antipolo is famously known for her guidance for travelers and her role in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade. Unbeknownst to many, the Virgin of Antipolo also performed an important miracle that led to a beautiful tradition that is still observed up to the present.\n\nA cholera outbreak was spreading the Philippine Islands and several people died everyday during the outbreak and Antipolo was not spared. The people were alarmed with the situation that they decided to seek the help of the Virgin of Antipolo to eradicate the plague. The people brought the image and was brought in procession then later enthroned on top of a hill and held a mass . After the mass, the plague was gone and this became a practice to bring the Virgin to the hill in special times of need.\n\nThe Hill is now called the Pinagmisahan Hills and today, on the first Tuesday of May – the Feast of Nuestra Señora de la Paz y Buien Viaje, the image is brought to Pinagmisahan Hills and held the opening mass to signal the beginning of the Pilgrimage season that would last until the First Tuesday of July.\n\nNuestra Señora de Peñafrancia de Naga\n\nThe Queen of Bicolandia is undoubtedly beloved by the whole Bicolandia due to the numerous miracles that were attributed to her intercession and the month of September became an important month for Bicolanos because it is on this day they celebrate her famed fiesta. When the cholera morbo hit Nueva Ceceres in 1883, The bishop of Nueva Caceres, Msgr. Casimiro Hererra had the image of Nuestra Señora de Peñafrancia brought to the Cathedral imploring her maternal protection and help for the townspeople from the dreadful disease. Along with the image of El Divino Rostro, the unceasing prayers of the faithful can be heard in the Cathedral of St. John in Nueva Caceres.\n\nBishop Casimiro Herrera with his priests then made a promise, should the dreadful disease spare Naga, the Divino Rostro will be pompously venerated with special festivities together with the Virgin of Peñafrancia. Our Lord and Our Lady di not turn a deaf ear and the cholera epidemic in Naga ceased a few days later.\n\nWhen the image of the Virgin was to be taken to the Cathedral from the shrine on September of 1883, the Divino Rostro was also carried along in the procession with the priests themselves carrying it on their shoulders. The miracle and the vow made the Bicolano faithful was the beginning of the annual festivities in honor of the Queen of Bicolandia that is still observed up to this day.\n\nNuestra Señora de la Salud\n\nOne of the surviving images of Old Intramuros, the image of Nuestra Señora de la Salud of the Augustinian Recollect Friars. What made the Virgen de la Salud more popular during the Spanish regime was due to the miracle that took place during the Chinese uprising in 1639. The Virgin of Health, then enshrined to her own church in San Juan de Bagumbayan, was transferred to San Nicolas de Tolentino in Intramuros. This was done to have a novena for the health and cure of the armada from fever that was rampant during that time and to establish peace. The prayers were held with grand solemnity, attended by no less than the Archbishop of Manila, the city officials, the Royal Audiencia, and the great multitude of the faithful, who profited much from the devotion to the Virgen de la Salud.\n\nWith that particular miracle attributed to the image of the Virgin of Health, devotees grew over the centuries. One of the most prolific devotee of the Virgin was the great St. Ezekiel Moreno whom he invokes as “Nuestra Señora Salud de los Enfermos” and sought her Patronage. The image at present is currently enshrined to her permanent chapel at San Nicolas de Tolentino Parish in Quezon City and once again performing healing miracles and gaining new devotees of this generation.\n\nNuestra Señora del Buen Suceso de Parañaque\n\nThe miraculous image of Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso de Parañaque is hailed as the Queen and Patroness of Parañaque City and its Diocese. Known for its famed miracles since her arrival and enthronement years later.\n\nOne of the most astounding miracles of “Nana Ciso”, as she was fondly called by her devotees, was during the cholera outbreak from 1662 – 1664. Many residents of Parañaque died on a daily basis that the people decided to cling to their last resort – their beloved and miraculous Patroness. The people of Parañaque went to the prior of St. Andrew’s convent, Fr. Francisco Martinez, OSA to ask to borrow the image of the Virgin so they could bring her to the visitas and in processions and ask her intercession to cease the epidemic. Fr. Martinez happily agreed with the condition that the image will be out of her church for a night.\n\nWith this concession, the people immediately arranged a procession on November 25, 1664 and Fr. Martinez with his companions also joined the procession said the litanies against the pestilence. That same day, all of the residents who were afflicted with the epidemic were suddenly cured and accompanied the Virgin back to the Church and the epidemic vanished in Parañaque.\n\nNuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga\n\nThe famous Queen of Cavite is also known as the the “Virgin of thousand miracles” due to the numerous miracles that she wrought to her devotees from the time the image was discovered at Cañacao Bay. One of her most notable miracle is the miracle that ended the cholera outbreak in Cavite Puerto. In 1882, a terrible cholera epidemic spread in Cavite Puerto.It was said that Caviteños died by the hundreds and the streets had been a scene of daily funeral processions. The Spanish politico-military governor of Cavite, Don Juan Salcedo Y Mantilla de los Rios, ordered the spraying and burning of gunpowders on the streets so that the fire and the smoke they produce might drive away the virus of the disease. During this epidemic, the Governor himself fell ill.One afternoon, as he was about to take his siesta, he ordered his soldiers not to admit any visitor.After some time, he heard a persistent knock at the door. To his surprise, he found an old woman dressed in black.\n\nAfter the customary greetings, she asked him to give orders that the fiesta of Cavite be celebrated with the greatest pomp possible. The Governor, eager to send the intruder away, agreed to the request. Then, the unwanted visitor left.The Governor, filled with fury at his soldiers, reprimanded them for admitting the old lady. The guards replied that they had not allowed anyone to enter the house. Then the Governor remembered the request. He realized that it must be the Virgin Herself who appeared to him.He also realized that after talking to the woman, the fever had left him. He immediately heeded the Virgin’s request after the epidemic ended and through this miracle that led to the elaborate celebrations of the Feast of the Queen of Cavite that is still observed, especially on the month of November.\n\nNuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Cebu\n\nThe miraculous image of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Cebu is known as one of the most famous miraculous patrons of Cebu. A certain miracle that took place in 1902 that earned her the distinction as the Patroness of Cebu. In 1902, there was a cholera outbreak that hit the whole city but hardest hit was Barrio Guadalupe and many of the residents died. Placido “Edo” Datan initiated a move and called on the barrio leaders to hold a penitential dawn procession and chant the “Antifona” [The prayer Hail Mary in Spanish (Dios Te Salve Maria) but sung repeatedly in a very plaintive tune.] to invoke the help of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Holy Cross of Jesus, and end the epidemic. The procession and the singing of the “Antifona” was held from mid-May to Mid-June.\n\nThe cholera epidemic stopped but not immediately. As the dawn procession went on, the number of deaths decreased until there were no more deaths in the barrio. As an act of thanksgiving to God and to the Virgin of Guadalupe, Silverio Gonzales and the other people involved, decided to hold a thanksgiving novena from July 8 to 16 1902, with a grand procession of the Holy Cross and the image of the Virgin. Since then, July 16 has always been celebrated as the second fiesta of the Virgin of Guadalupe of Cebu.\n\nNuestra Señora del Patrocinio de Boljoon\n\nThe Nuestra Señora del Patrocinio de Boljoon is the miraculous Patroness of Boljoon, Cebu since 1599 when the Augustinians established a chapel, then later became a parish in Nabulho, that would later be known as Boljoon, located near Carcar. Since her enthronement, miracles began to be reported through the intercession of La Patrocinio from saving tehm from Moro raids and calamities that threatened Boljoon.\n\nIn the writings of Fr. Fabian Rodriguez, a cholera epidemic broke out in nearby towns of southern Cebu that deaths were reported in a fast pace. However, the epidemic did not reach Boljoon, as the townsfolk invoked for the motherly protection of the Blessed Mother. Numerous prayers were answered and diseases were healed due to the loving intercession and protection of the Virgin that pilgrims come to her church constantly to as k for her intercession for their different needs.\n\nNuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Extremadura de Loboc\n\nThis image of Neustra Señora de Guadalupe de Extremadura de Loboc arrived in Loboc, Bohol in 1843 in perfect timing where a cholera epidemic was spreading in Bohol. However, feeling responsible for ignoring Loboc of the visitation of Our Lady, they pursued in bringing the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe to the Parish of Sts. Peter and Paul. This happened on May 24, 1843. And the crate bearing the image of Our Lady was unlocked without difficulty. The Lobocanons in their grief and with a vestige of hope, turned to the Blessed Virgin Mary for help, through the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. And the supplication of the Lobocanons was answered.\n\nAfter bringing the image to a fluvial procession in the Loboc River, a three-hour heavy downpour took place. The cholera epidemic lifted and the people were able to resume their daily occupations and praied the Lord and Our Lady of the deliverance of the town and she immediately became the town’s patroness.\n\nNuestra Señora del Pilar de Imus\n\nThe image of Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Imus, fondly called “Nana Pilar” to her devotees, is known as one of the famed images of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the province of Cavite due to the numerous miracles that were attributed to her intercession.\n\nOne of the most notable miracles of the Virgin happened during the tenure of one of its illustrious priests that would become a saint in the future – St. Ezekiel Moreno. The assignment of St. Ezekiel Moreno as the Administrator of the Hacienda de Imus in 1892 that Fr. and to help the parish priest Fray Jose Maria Learte, OAR was proven to be a providential act from heaven for it was during this time that Haceinda de Imus was striken with the Cholera epidemic that greatly affected the Hacienda. It is said that Fr. Moreno often prayed in front of the Image of Nana Pilar and ask for the cessation of the Epidemic; the outbreak did kill 3,200 Imuseños, but with the grace of God and intercession of the Blessed Mother the epidemic ceased.\n\nNuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Makati\n\nThe Virgin of Guadalupe is the official Celestial Patroness of the Philippines due to its close historical link with Mexico and to the miracles that she also did here in our country since the introduction of her cultus in the Philippines years after the famed apparitions to St. Juan Diego.\n\nOne of the most recent accounts of divine and maternal intervention of Our Lady in times of plagues occurred during the early 2000’s. It was during this time that outbreak of SARS was spreading all over the world. It is reported that the Late Jaime Cardinal Sin, then the Archbishop of Manila, requested that the Pilgrim Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe (a replica of the tilma) be brought to his residence in Villa San Miguel. This said image is a faithful copy of the original Tilma enshrined in Mexico City, which was given as a gift to the Cardinal by Filipino pilgrims to celebrate the centennial of the Canonical Coronation of Our Lady of Guadalupe as Empress of the Americas and the Philippines in 1994.\n\nThe Pilgrim tilma was brought and enthroned in the chapel of the Villa. It is narrated that after the cardinal prayed before the venerable image, the threat of SARS abated, and things went back to normal for our country.\n\nA commentary\n\nIn these times where most of the world is in panic and would do questionable decisions that would stir more fear to the people, we should not be afraid, as Our Lord and Our Lady often tells us because this is the perfect opportunity to strengthen one’s faith, or in some cases, re-examine it. Instead of us panicking on the virus, aside from doing the necessary preventive measures to keep us safe, we also should storm the heavens with unceasing prayers and sacrifices, do penances, amend one’s ways, ask forgiveness of sins, do acts of reparation, do good works and live a holy life, that way, Our Lord will hear our sincere plea to cease the spread of the virus and live better lives.\n\nTo conclude this blogpost, here are some recommended prayers and practices that we can do to appease God’s justice to end this plague\n\nRecommended prayers:\n\nOratio Imperata on the 2019 Novel Corona Virus\n\n(Published by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines)\n\nGod our Father, we come to you in our need to ask your protection against the COVID 19\n\nthat has disturbed and even claimed lives.
