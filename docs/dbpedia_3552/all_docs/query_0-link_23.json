Gone was the Civil War mystique of battle and upon us was the dawning of the technological wonders of the twentieth century. The Spanish-American War, in spite of its tremendous implications for the United States, Spain, Cuba, the Philippines, and Guam is seldom mentioned in the popular media or brought to the attention of the public. Most may have heard the statement “Remember the Maine,” but few have an understanding that the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor instigated the war with Spain and the subsequent U.S. Navy attack on the Spanish squadron in the Philippines. Acclaimed historian and author of numerous exemplary works A.B. “Bud” Feuer has offered in America at War: The Philippines, 1898–1913 an engrossing personal account of this often overlooked foray for freedom. This book is a compilation of personal accounts conveying the American soldier and sailor’s battle to defeat the Spanish foe in the Philippines. In what has commonly carried the misnomer, “The Splendid Little War,” Feuer compiles a set of first-hand accounts to narrate America’s extension of the Spanish-American War. From the Philippine littoral region to ground actions on the Philippine Islands this book is quite possibly the most readable, detailed chronicle of its kind. Since the Spanish-American War occurred in the interval between two conflicts that resulted in great death and anguish to the United States, not many Americans have paid much attention to its existence. The Spanish-American War was relatively bloodless from the American perspective and therefore, by an odd measurement of standards, unimportant. However, Feuer’s research has identified letters, memoirs, and diaries that dispel the conventional thought that the ground battles in and around Manila “didn’t amount to much.”\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\nOf note in America at War are the blockhouse battles. Feuer offers intriguing first-person accounts of the fighting which took place along the Pasig River on the north outskirts of Manila running to a few miles south of Malate and the various trench battles that took place near Taguig. These are some of the most thorough descriptions of America’s attempt to squash the insurgent uprisings that I have read. The stirring letters home and correspondent dispatches to various newspapers in the United States offer a provocative depiction of what it was like to be “sleeping in dog tents—and being used for target practice by the insurgents.” Having written a World War II chronicle of the Bataan Death March titled Surviving Bataan and Beyond: Colonel Irvin Alexander’s Odyssey as a Japanese POW (1999), Feuer’s America at War: The Philippines, 1898–1913 offers a stark reminder of the long history of turmoil the Philippine Islands have experienced. It is a country of tumultuous past and the Spanish-American War is a significant part of this past. Bud Feuer begins this expertly woven and meticulously compartmentalized roundtable-type discussion of experiences with a histrionic depiction of the U.S. Asiatic Squadron attack on Admiral Patricio Montojo’s Spanish squadron during the Battle of Manila. Starting in April 1898, Americans joined the battle near Canacao Bay with five cruisers and two gunboats as its squadrons “steamed deeper into the enemy’s lair.” As written in the letters and diaries of those participating in the Battle of Manila, then-Commodore George Dewey’s squadron struck quickly upon the Spanish squadron at bay, thus ending centuries of Spanish influence in the Far East and confirming the United States as a world naval power. The first sighting of a Spanish vessel was described in the diary of John McCutcheon, a journalist and freelance newspaper correspondent, who was aboard the U.S. revenue cutter McCulloch on April 30, 1898, “a few miles from Subic.” In the end, Dewey’s victory at Manila Bay was an unparalleled success at that time in history for it was the first time an entire fleet was destroyed without the loss of a ship or man from an attacking force. The majority of accounts offered by Feuer are presented in a well-balanced manner placing heavy emphasis on John McCutcheon’s diary inserts, letters, and notes from which one can draw a check of sorts on the reliability of other accounts. McCutcheon’s ubiquitous presence throughout this book is important for he has a seemingly keen eye for battle and an articulate manner for relating what he saw. Feuer’s careful placement of McCutcheon’s contributions gives credence to his abilities as a nonfiction historian. From an historic perspective readers will be engrossed with not only the exactness of this book’s narration of the American and its Spanish foe’s naval and ground exploits, but also that of Aguinaldo’s insurgents. Little has been written about how the insurgents turned on the U.S. forces once the Spanish were defeated. America at War fills that void. When Bud Feuer asked me to read his manuscript and provide a foreword I was deeply honored, for unbeknownst to him his work in providing historical\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nmilitary narratives to the history of this country’s great warriors is immensely popular among the ranks of modern-day soldiers and this book is no exception. Lieutenant Colonel Dominic J. Caraccilo Fort Benning, Georgia\n\nForeword If asked about colonialism, most Americans will associate it with the British and French. The U.S. government never admitted to being a colonial power, and so the lands it seized were termed possessions. Filipino patriots and revolutionaries who fought for independence were disparaged as insurrectos and bandits instead of being compared with our own Washington and Jefferson, and their revolutionary struggle was verbally delegitimatized as an insurrection. As shown in these many passages skillfully selected, assembled, and annotated by Bud Feuer, the individual American soldiers who fought in the Philippine-American War varied widely in their consciousness, from those who somehow believed they were on the side of liberty, to others who realized the truth was just the opposite. The greatest value of these first-hand writings pertaining to the war in the Philippines from 1898 to 1913 is that they provide an enormous amount of detail that is missing from most historical accounts, and also that they allow us insight into the consciousness and personal thoughts of the participants. They are also arranged in such a way that the various diary entries, letters, and memoirs—mostly written near the moment of action by ordinary soldiers—reconstruct the threads of the story of the Spanish-American War in the Philippines and the subsequent Philippine-American War, from the perspective of those directly involved. But not from all sides. Even though there are inclusions pertaining to the Spanish side of the conflict with the United States, it was impossible for Bud Feuer to attempt to piece together enough Filipino versions to produce a balanced story, not because he was adverse to their side, but because of the dearth of available information and materials, a scarcity that should be explained. The Filipino fighters were, to say the least, poorly equipped and had little or no access to basic writing materials. They were mostly unpaid and so could not\n\nxiv\n\nForeword\n\npurchase paper for writing, and were excluded from Manila, and later other urban centers where writing supplies could be bought. Their meager supplies of paper were reserved for official purposes, and the only Filipino diary of the war I know of was semi-official, that of Simeon A. Villa, medical officer of President Emilio Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo, Villa, and the diary were captured at Palanan in northeastern Luzon in March 1901, and the diary was published in the Philippines in 1973 in one of the five volumes of “insurrection,” records originally compiled by John R. M. Taylor that had been suppressed for decades. The Filipino fighters were a defeated army, often forced to retreat, shifting their base of operations, exposed to the elements; diaries would have been an encumbrance. Papers would be destroyed in crossing rivers, and by rain, mud, humidity, fires, warm temperatures, sun, insects, fungi, and the general conditions in wartime. Writings would also have to be prevented from falling into the hands of the enemy, for obvious reasons, and even until long after the cessation of actual fighting, any partisan materials had to be destroyed or remain safely hidden, at the risk of possible imprisonment, exile, or execution. Another reason for the lack of diaries is that so many of the Filipino fighters were killed. The majority of the most dedicated and courageous soldiers on the front lines perished around Manila and in central Luzon from the vastly superior firepower of the Americans, especially from their naval and gunboat bombardments; artillery shells loaded with deadly shrapnel; Hotchkiss guns that were revolvingbarrel machine guns; and Gatling guns that produced hails of bullets. A generation of the ablest Filipinos was decimated, first by the Spanish and then especially by the Americans between 1896 and 1906; in Luzon alone it is estimated that 1 million Filipinos died while resisting the invading Americans or merely as innocent victims. We can never know just how much was lost in both potential and actual writings, and how many diaries and letters were never brought to light. The United States had declared war against Spain for supposed humanitarian purposes, not to acquire colonial territories. Deceived by this claim, and other explicit and implicit statements by representatives of the U.S. government, including Admiral Dewey and Consuls Pratt and Wildman, and encouraged by the Americans after Dewey’s naval victory in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, Aguinaldo and the Filipino forces, at great cost to themselves, drove the Spanish from the Philippines, except for a few enclaves and the city of Manila. The Spanish then surrendered Manila in August 1898 by secret arrangement—after a staged battle—to the Americans, who excluded the Filipino fighters from the city. Four months later, in December 1898, the United States agreed to purchase the Philippines from a Spain that no longer controlled her, as if it were legal to buy a nation and her people against their will. The agreed-upon price of $20 million amounted to about $2 per person. After numerous troop ships arrived with sufficient reinforcements, the United States commenced its war against the Filipinos on February 4, 1899, manufacturing a pretext to pretend the initial attack had come from the other side. The\n\nForeword\n\nxv\n\nclaimed pretext for launching the American offensive was that a Filipino had passed near an American sentry, Private Willie Grayson, at San Juan Bridge, had not obeyed the order to halt, and so was gunned down. Now over a hundred years later it is possible to state unequivocally that the outbreak of fighting was actually a carefully planned aggression. The Filipinos were caught unprepared, with their commanding officers away from their lines, and no reinforcements for their front lines were in place. In the week preceding the February 4 outbreak, American artillery was moved up to vantage points overlooking the Filipino lines, on the excuse that these units needed higher ground to avoid mosquitoes. Filipino employees inside the city of Manila were discharged. The American commander, General Otis, imposed a strict press censorship that included control of cables going overseas. The attack was also timed to influence a crucial vote in the U.S. Senate about the treaty with Spain over the Philippines, scheduled for February 6. With censorship in place, Otis, President McKinley, and the imperialist faction were able to falsely claim that the Filipinos had been the aggressors, and in response the U.S. Senate voted to annex the Philippines by the margin of only a single vote. Even after hostilities had commenced, with about 3,000 Filipinos killed in the first day, Aguinaldo still asked Otis to negotiate a ceasefire, to which Otis cynically and revealingly replied that since the fighting had begun, it must go on to the bitter end. Wars are not started by privates. As for the shooting near San Juan Bridge by Private Grayson that was supposed to have begun the war, it was the daily practice of Filipino farmers and workmen to return home using that bridge, which was the link between Santa Mesa, a district of Manila, and the town of San Juan. All that was necessary to create the pretext for an attack was to give orders to the sentries not to allow anyone to pass. The Filipino who was shot and killed was apparently an unarmed civilian; he may have been wearing a bolo strapped around his waist (a small machete that is routinely worn by farmers and workers) as is customary even to the present time in rural areas. We have accounts of the incident from interviews with Private Grayson, another sentry with him, and their officers, published in U.S. Army reports, which describe the circumstances. In fact, three probably unarmed Filipino civilians were gunned down in quick succession at the bridge over the San Juan River that evening. It was no accident that this location was chosen as the point where the Americans launched the brunt of their initial offensive, since the waterworks for Manila were in San Juan, by far the most crucial piece of territory then controlled by the Filipinos. A decade before the start of the Philippine-American War, the acclaimed Filipino writer, genius, and martyr Dr. Jose´ Rizal had predicted that the Philippines might fall into the sphere of influence of the United States. He also correctly predicted that the Filipinos would fight a long and bloody war against any imperialist power that attempted to succeed the Spanish tyranny. Although the American colonial regime attempted to make use of Rizal, who had been shot after a mock trial by the Spaniards in 1896, saying he would have approved\n\nxvi\n\nForeword\n\nof their rule, they had to twist his words in translation for that purpose, and it was always flatly contradicted by all the members of Rizal’s family, including his brother Paciano who became an officer in the struggle against the Americans, and his mother Teodora who steadfastly refused the financial assistance the regime repeatedly offered. The one-sided war by the Americans against the Filipinos, so vividly described in this volume, thanks to the efforts of Bud Feuer, will, in my opinion, be best understood by American readers if they try to constantly empathize with the aspirations of Aguinaldo, Rizal, and the millions of ordinary Filipinos who were on the other side. This is the third volume of Philippine-related diaries produced by Bud Feuer, and I feel he has performed a valuable service by rescuing these unique historical documents from obscurity and making them available in such a convenient and readable form.

In 1895 he became a leader in the Katipunan, a revolutionary society that sought complete independence from Spain. In 1896 the Filipinos revolted against the heavy taxes imposed upon them by the Spanish government. People unable to pay their taxes were forced to toil at hard labor and work out payments at the rate of ten cents a day. In September Aguinaldo, leading a ragtag band of soldiers, defeated Spanish General Aguirre’s regiment at the Battle of Imus. After his victory, Aguinaldo issued a manifesto urging the Filipino people to rally to the cause of the revolution. Then, two months later, he handed the Spanish another setback at Cavite. This victory incited the people in other provinces of Luzon to also take up arms against their oppressors. The Spanish, however, were determined to put down the revolt and defeated Aguinaldo’s followers in a series of battles. In June 1897 Aguinaldo was forced to flee Cavite, and with a band of loyal Filipinos, he relocated in the mountains near Bulacan. In order to quell the rebellion the Spanish authorities reached an agreement with the revolutionaries whereby Spain would pay $800,000 to Aguinaldo in exchange for his voluntary exile to Hong Kong. The rebels would lay down their arms, and a general amnesty would be granted to Aguinaldo’s men. The Spanish government also promised to institute social reforms in the islands. In early 1898 uprisings again began to take place on Luzon as the Spaniards continued their abusive treatment of the Filipinos. After the sinking of the USS Maine in the harbor at Havana, Cuba, in February 1898, tensions between the United States and Spain quickly reached the boiling point. On April 22, E. Spencer Pratt, the U.S. Consul General at Sin-\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\ngapore, arranged a meeting with Emilio Aguinaldo. Pratt gave the Filipino leader a verbal promise that in the case of a war with Spain, he would guarantee independence to the Philippine Islands if Aguinaldo would return to the Philippines and incite the people against the Spanish. Three days later America declared war on Spain. On May 19, almost three weeks after Commodore George Dewey’s victory over the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay, Aguinaldo and thirteen of his lieutenants arrived at Cavite and conferred with Dewey. That same day Aguinaldo issued a proclamation urging his countrymen to join the war against Spain to win freedom for their country. Near the end of June Aguinaldo declared a provisional government and issued a declaration of independence. However, with the arrival of the first American troops, Aguinaldo was informed that the United States recognized his military leadership but not his civil authority. The U.S. State Department also repudiated Pratt’s promise of Philippine independence, stating that Pratt did not have the authority to “make pledges or discuss policy.” This rejection was a slap in the face to Aguinaldo. And eight months later it would result in the United States becoming embroiled in a bloody struggle in the Philippine Islands. The story of America’s war in the Philippines from 1898 to 1913 is told in the memoirs, diaries, and letters of the men—men who not only fought a determined enemy, but also the weather, jungle, and disease. Their writings have put a human face on the American soldier, sailor, and marine who served in the Philippine Islands in the early part of the twentieth century.\n\n1\n\nFrom Hong Kong to Mirs Bay: The Memoirs of John T. McCutcheon In January 1898 two freelance newspaper correspondents, John T. McCutcheon and Edwin Harden, went aboard the U.S. Treasury Department’s newest thousand-ton revenue cutter, the McCulloch, for an intended trip around the world. John McCutcheon narrated the journey that would take him from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to the Philippine Islands and a war that would change the course of American history. “The first leg of our cruise was to be the Madeira Islands. We carried ninety tons of coal on the deck. One could not move forward or aft without climbing over the sacks. The ship was narrow and built for speed. The McCulloch had a new type of construction that was so faulted that she nearly capsized the first day. Her center of gravity appeared to be too high. With all that coal on board, she was hopelessly top-heavy. In order to keep our minds off the possibility of the McCulloch turning-turtle and going down with all hands, several of us passengers formed the Coal Bag Club. We would perch on top of the coal bags and take turns reading stories aloud to each other. “When we reached Malta on February 15, we learned of the sinking of the USS Maine. Our captain, Daniel B. Hodgsdon, immediately decided that we had better hurry on with our journey in case war was declared between the United States and Spain. “Upon arriving at Singapore, the American consul, E. Spencer Pratt, notified Hodgsdon that the McCulloch had been transferred from the Treasury to the Navy Department. He was also handed orders to proceed at once to Hong Kong and report to Commodore George Dewey. Hodgsdon was cautioned to avoid Spanish ports and Spanish ships. “We anchored in Hong Kong Harbor on Sunday April 17, and sighted Dewey’s squadron—dressed in white paint with awnings spread. It seemed prob-\n\n2\n\nAmerica at War\n\nable that as soon as war was declared, the warships would steam to Manila and engage the Spanish fleet. “With the help of the American consul general, Ed Harden made arrangements to be a correspondent for the New York World. I cabled the Chicago Record, informed them that I was in Hong Kong, and was told to send all the stuff I could. Joseph Stickney of the New York Herald was also on hand. That made three of us to report the war. “I quickly learned that this is a bad time of year for conducting any kind of military operations in the South China Sea, as the southwest monsoons are upon us. A fearful gale was blowing the night before last and all day yesterday, making ship movements in the harbor dangerous, and small boat traffic impossible. “The bubonic plague is raging here and in Canton. In Hong Kong there are more than twenty deaths a day. A ship came into port recently from Bangkok with cholera on board. Thirty people had died on the vessel. When we first arrived at Hong Kong, I noticed the body of a small child floating in the water. It evidently had been dead for some time, but no attempt was made by passing sampans to pick it up. “There is much hurried activity aboard Commodore Dewey’s fleet. Early Tuesday (April 19), the task of painting the ships with battle colors began. The shade was a drab gray—contrasting slightly from the color of the sea. In less than four hours, the USS Boston had a coat of paint brushed on every spar, mast and funnel—as well as the entire hull itself. A few hours later, the newly designated USS McCulloch had also received her coat of war paint. Before nightfall the U.S. Navy’s men-of-war—Olympia, Raleigh, Concord and Petrel— had been transformed. “The USS Baltimore was due to arrive Wednesday (April 20) with a shipment of ammunition. But, due to rough seas, she did not reach Hong Kong until Friday morning. The work of distributing the cargo of explosives began immediately. “When the squadron leaves Hong Kong, it will proceed up the China coast to a protected bay, and practice necessary naval tactics for a day or two before sailing to the Philippines. In case of an attack on Manila, it is understood that the Olympia, Baltimore, Boston and Raleigh will be the front line. The Concord and Petrel will support from the rear. The McCulloch is too lightly armed to be a fighting warship. Her armament only consists of four six-pounders and a few rapid-fire Hotchkiss guns. The McCulloch is also not armored. She will probably be used to hunt mines and as a dispatch boat. “It was believed that the American fleet was superior in strength, but not in numbers. The Spaniards had four large warships, and many small gunboats. The Spanish were reported to be removing all valuables and church treasures from Manila—more in anticipation of the fury of the Filipinos than of any pillage by the Americans. It was also learned that Spanish and other foreign residents were\n\nFrom Hong Kong to Mirs Bay\n\n3\n\nleaving the islands in large numbers, and only Spain’s army and naval forces would be left to confront Commodore Dewey’s squadron. “Several naval officers who I talked to were of the opinion that the Spaniards would keep their warships close in the harbor behind mine fields, while their coast artillery batteries would challenge the Americans. If this was the case, a short decisive action would be impossible—and it might become necessary to force an entrance to the harbor despite the mines. “It was important that the Spanish fleet be destroyed quickly, since our ships would be at the mercy of typhoons. Supplies and coal could also become a problem in case of a long siege. For Harden, Stickney and myself, it seemed like we would be sailing into the jaws of a dragon. Historically, in naval battles, at least a quarter of the participants were killed. Fearing the worst, we wrote farewell letters home, and packed everything we did not absolutely need in camphorwood boxes and sent them ashore. “The American naval force was ready to steam to Manila at a moment’s notice. In his instructions to Captain Hodgsdon, Dewey stated that the squadron will head across the China Sea in open order, keeping a distance of twelve hundred yards between ships. In case of bad weather, the vessels will form a more compact formation. “On Sunday April 24, while the fleet was still lying at anchor off Hong Kong, we learned that a state of war existed between the United States and Spain. Joseph Chamberlin, British secretary for the colonies, notified Commodore Dewey that all English ports would be compelled to observe strict neutrality. Dewey was given until four o’clock Monday afternoon to leave port. I was permitted to observe the squadron sailings from the decks of the Olympia. “At two o’clock Sunday afternoon, the Boston, Concord, McCulloch and Petrel hurriedly hoisted anchor and left the harbor. Men on watch were instructed to be extra alert, and orders were issued that no lights were to be shown. At dark, our ships could barely be seen against the distant hills. Only somber black spars occasionally showed themselves against the silhouette of moving clouds. “Shortly before ten o’clock Monday morning, the Olympia, followed by the Baltimore and Raleigh, slowly moved up Hong Kong Harbor. The bands on all three ships began playing Hail Columbia as we made a grand exit of the bay. “Soldiers, packing the rails of a British troopship, cheered and waved their hats as we passed. Our sailors answered vigorously. Small steam launches, crowded with Americans, puffed alongside the Olympia. The passengers waved handkerchiefs and shouted encouragement until we reached the open sea. The Raleigh had broken an air pump the day before, and the flotilla’s speed had to be reduced. “About 3 P.M., we dropped anchor in Mirs Bay, a small inlet thirty-five miles north of Hong Kong. The other ships of the squadron were waiting for us— including two cargo steamers, the Nanshan and Zafiro. Dewey had purchased these vessels before we left Hong Kong. “Mirs Bay is virtually an uninhabited cove. There is a small Chinese village\n\n4\n\nAmerica at War\n\nback in the hills, but except for this community, there is little evidence of life along the shore. Every now and then, a few curious sampans approach our anchorage, and occasionally the faint outline of a junk’s sails can be seen out at sea. From the standpoint of seclusion, however, there could hardly be a more desirable rendezvous spot. “At six o’clock, a small smudge of smoke was sighted in the distance. About an hour later, a navy dispatch boat pulled up alongside the Olympia and delivered a coded message to the commodore. For a few minutes, a tense but quiet pause spread throughout the ship. Then suddenly, without warning, colored lights began flashing rapidly from the foremast, signaling all ship commanding officers to report aboard the Olympia. “A conference was held in the wardroom, where Commodore Dewey read his orders from the Navy Department, ‘You are to proceed to the Philippine Islands and capture or destroy the Spanish fleet!’ “The meeting was over about 10 P.M., and aboard every ship there was a burst of frantic activity. From the Olympia, a continuous stream of flashing lights detailed more instructions to the squadron. “The sounds of the fleet preparing for war and the sharp shouts of officers bellowing orders spread crisply across the bay. Amid the frenzied excitement, all useless articles, such as woodwork and doors were thrown overboard. Masts were bound with anchor chains. The rigging was snaked with zigzag rope to keep the heavy wire stays from falling on deck. Shot stoppers were fabricated to plug shell holes in the hull. Lifeboats were wrapped with canvas to protect them against flying splinters. The aft lifeboats were lowered halfway in case of emergency. Every piece of machinery was carefully examined and tested. Pumps were overhauled, and ammunition was placed in readiness. “I rejoined Harden aboard the McCulloch and, as our crew was comparatively small, we were assigned to work with the gun and ammunition squads. A sick bay and battle dressing station were set up on the berth deck, and four men were detailed to assist the surgeon. A stretcher was built, and life preservers and buoyant cushions were scattered about. The decks were cleared for action!” While the American squadron was anchored at Hong Kong, much of Commodore George Dewey’s time was spent in consultation with his various ship captains. All possibilities and eventualities of conflict with the enemy were discussed. Dewey called upon his officers to express their opinions freely, and all ideas were given careful consideration. But these were not the only problems that troubled the commodore. Spanish agents in Hong Kong continually spread rumors concerning the mining of channels surrounding the island of Corregidor and parts of Manila Bay. Because of all the disinformation he was receiving, Dewey set up his own spy network. He assigned his aide, Ensign F. B. Upham to pose as a civilian interested in the sea and ships. Upham would interview crews attached to vessels that had arrived from Manila. Additional information was obtained from an American businessman living\n\nFrom Hong Kong to Mirs Bay\n\n5\n\nin Hong Kong, who made frequent trips to the Philippines and reported his observations to the commodore. Surprisingly, U.S. Navy Intelligence was so lacking that Dewey was forced to buy charts of the Philippine Islands at a Hong Kong store. One of George Dewey’s major dilemmas was the Spanish coastal batteries. The island of Corregidor divided the entrance of Manila Bay into two channels. The north passage—between Corregidor and the Bataan peninsula—was called Boca Chica, and was only two miles wide. The south channel, Boca Grande, was five miles in width. Strong fortifications, mounting heavy Krupp guns, had been constructed on the island and mainland. Both channels had been mined by the Spaniards. The narrow passage was the shallower of the two and potentially more dangerous. Dewey believed that mining the deeper channel would be much more difficult, and he doubted that it could be accomplished successfully. But one problem was foremost in Dewey’s thoughts—the knowledge that no reinforcements or assistance of any kind would be arriving from the United States to support his squadron. And, in the event he lost the battle or any of his ships were damaged, there was no safe harbor available. Neutrality laws were against the Americans in all Asian ports, and home base was eight thousand miles away. By heading to Manila Commodore Dewey was burning all his bridges behind him. He had to be victorious. A failure of the mission could possibly result in the annihilation of his squadron. A reporter for the New York Journal, who witnessed the American ships leave the China coast, wrote: “When Dewey’s squadron sailed out from Mirs Bay, it reminded me of thoroughbred race horses, trained to the minute by an expert who not only knew his animals, but also his competition and the conditions of the race.” Meanwhile, an editorial in the Manila Times attempted to calm the fears of the city’s Spanish residents with the following remarks: “Some of our readers commented with alarm upon the arrival at Hong Kong of the North American Pacific Squadron. They seem to see this as a menace to the Philippine Islands. And, in this regard, we feel obligated to say a few words. “First, remain tranquil. We will not allow ourselves to be needlessly alarmed by those persons, who like an ostrich, hide their heads under their wings, and rest in fancied security. We will view the question reduced to its just proportions. “The rendezvous of these American warships—which they have dignified by designating them a squadron—is not a serious menace to Spanish rule in the Philippines. A London cable states that the men-of-war assembled at Hong Kong are the ‘ironclads’ Olympia, Raleigh, Boston, Concord and Petrel. “Not one of these ships is an ‘ironclad.’ The Olympia is a fine cruiser with a protective deck, but no armor or protection for its battery. Her displacement is 5,800 tons, and she has a supposed speed of twenty-one knots. But her real speed is much less, as she has not been docked for some time.\n\n6\n\nAmerica at War\n\n“The Boston and Raleigh are second-class cruisers, also with protective decks—undoubtedly very thin. They both have a displacement of about 3,200 tons, and their armament is nothing extraordinary for vessels of this type. “The Concord and Petrel are protected gunboats of 1,700 and 890 tons, respectively, and with very moderate speed—probably not more than fourteen knots. “From this data, it is obvious that this so-called squadron will not cause a single tremor to Spanish power in the Philippines. And do not for a moment forget, we have our own cruisers of more than 3,000 tons, others of more than 1,000 tons, and a number of gunboats. We also have land batteries which will be very effective against the American ships. We do not believe, however, that the Americans will attempt such a risky venture. Nevertheless, we cannot consider that the Yankees are merely making a straw fire. If not, then what was their objective in assembling a naval squadron at Hong Kong? “As we have so often said, the Americans are merely testing the strength and spirit of the Spanish government. The Americans do not care for war, but expect to gain all the riches that it will give them. Looking at it in this light, a visit of the American fleet to the Philippines is not sufficient to raise our fear, or produce the moral effect intended by the Washington government. The situation is beginning to look like movements on a chess board, whereby Washington is trying to force the hand of Spain. To gain the advantage, without loss to himself, is the whole object of President McKinley’s play.”\n\n2\n\nThree Days to Manila Shortly before the American fleet sailed from Mirs Bay, Commodore Dewey notified the journalists that no stories were to be sent to their newspapers until further notice. Joseph Stickney was permitted to sail on the Olympia and report the action from the decks of the flagship. John McCutcheon stayed aboard the McCulloch and wrote every day describing the three-day voyage to the Philippines, the sea battle at Manila Bay, and its aftermath. The stories were sent to the Chicago Record on May 7, and were published in diary format a few days later. April 27, 1898 This was a bleak, unfriendly kind of day. A heavy mist settled over the water, and there was a suggestion of fall in the air. Our crew was anxious to get underway, and the officers were chafing under the tedious waiting. Every passing day gives the Spanish more time to prepare for our attack on Manila. No one knows this better than the commodore, and consequently this awareness adds to the general uneasiness aboard the fleet. About 11 A.M., a tugboat entered the bay and steamed alongside the Olympia. On deck was Oscar F. Williams, the American consul to the Philippines, who had just arrived from Manila. Williams hurriedly climbed aboard the flagship, and Dewey immediately signaled his squadron to prepare to get underway at two o’clock. A feverish surge of activity swept the fleet, and volumes of black smoke began pouring from ship funnels. Lieutenant Elliot and I made a quick trip over to the Nanshan and Zafiro. There were hasty introductions, and much strained joking on how the squadron would soon be bursting into Manila Bay. Many a hope was expressed that we would be drinking to one another’s health in Manila within a few days. We returned to the McCulloch about one-thirty, and at 2 P.M. sharp the Olympia hoisted\n\n8\n\nAmerica at War\n\nanchor. The flagship’s marine detachment assembled on the quarterdeck, and the band struck up the inspiring march from “El Capitan.” Only a few curious junks were on hand to see us off. And, with radio silence, we knew that from this moment on, we would be cut off from the rest of the world. The McCulloch’s crew was lined up on deck, and Captain Hodgsdon read aloud the Spanish declaration of war as issued by the authorities at Manila. It was an inflammatory cry to the people of the Philippines to unite them against the sacrilegious vandals who were coming to loot their churches and insult their women. At the conclusion of the statement—which also contained a number of infuriating remarks about American sailors, as well as Uncle Sam—the crew broke into three rousing cheers for the Stars and Stripes. The Raleigh was steaming on the starboard quarter of the Olympia, while the McCulloch took her assigned position about a hundred yards abeam of the Raleigh’s stern. The Baltimore moved up to the port beam of the Raleigh, and the Petrel took her place on the Baltimore’s port quarter. A white flag with red diagonal crossbars—the commodore’s pennant—fluttered from the Olympia’s foremast. And, from her mainmast, the American flag waved with authority. The sky was overcast like the color of dull lead. There was a gentle swell, and a soft breeze blowing in from the China Sea. A purple hue covered the headlands that form the northern side of Mirs Bay. The squadron’s formation was gradually changing. The McCulloch moved to a position on the starboard beam of the Olympia. Two lines were formed. Steaming in the first column were the Olympia, Baltimore, Raleigh, Petrel, Concord and Boston, in that order. The McCulloch headed the second column that was comprised of the Nanshan and Zafiro. At dark, the fleet was steaming southeast at eight knots. The ships were marked by only a few lights—even the outlines of their hulls had dissolved into the blackness. The string of lights, stretching for a mile through the night, was ghostlike, harmless in appearance, but deadly in reality. The Olympia flashed her orders to the squadron—regulating speed and other matters. The red and white signal lights winked like fireflies as they sent their messages through the pitch-black darkness. Every now and then, the flagship fired a red rocket high in the sky. The bright light would float off to the stern for a moment, then vanish—snuffed out like a candle. April 28, 1898 Shortly after 5 A.M., a strange ship was sighted off the McCulloch’s starboard bow. We rushed to intercept the stranger, but it proved to be an English merchant vessel bound for the Philippines. The squadron held the same formation as it continued to plow through rough seas. The low clouds were very dark and threatening. The sky began to clear about nine o’clock. Aboard the McCulloch, gun watches were changed, and three-inch ammunition was shifted forward. Some of the men—myself included—received instructions in the use of sabres and pistols. A signal drill was held in the evening, and at 10 P.M. the ships were lashed by a fearful rainstorm. There is a great deal of speculation about the outcome of our attack on Manila. A few officers believe that the American fleet will promptly silence the Spanish batteries, and that the conquest of the city will be swift. But, behind this show of confidence, there is a nagging doubt. The fact that the enemy naval vessels outnumber us—and the land force is formidable make an easy victory improbable.\n\n2.1\n\nPhilippine Islands\n\n10\n\nAmerica at War\n\nApril 29, 1898 A heavy sea was rolling this afternoon, and a great deal of lightning could be seen to the south. The Nanshan and Zafiro were low in the water. Both ships were tossing and pitching. The McCulloch was also staggering and having trouble making headway. During the evening, the Olympia’s searchlights crossed and recrossed the sky, sweeping the horizon, and searching for any vessels that might try to sneak up on the squadron. It was one of the darkest nights in my memory. The position of each ship was marked only by a couple of masked lights on a mast. The small lights flickered like stars in the sky, for the ships themselves were not visible. Every porthole had been tightly closed. April 30, 1898 At 3:30 A.M., Cape Bolinao was sighted. At daylight, the island looked very green and beautiful in the morning sun. It reminded me of the coast of Cuba, approaching Havana from the north. There were faint lines of hills and mountains in the distance, and small patches of dark vegetation along the shore. The Boston and Concord were sent six miles ahead as scouts. While aboard the McCulloch, the crew busily cleared the decks for action. Ladders and fixed railings that were not absolutely necessary were taken down and stowed away. All sails were removed from the sail loft and banked on the forecastle as breastworks to protect the men stationed in exposed positions. Splinter nets were spread and firehoses run between decks—ready to drown any fires caused by bursting shells. Ammunition hoists were checked, and magazines opened. Every strip of bunting except signal flags were packed up. There was no visible excitement among the sailors, only a business-like calm that portended something imminent was about to happen. The Baltimore was soon ordered to join the Boston and Concord. They had instructions to enter Subic Bay, thirty miles north of Manila. Before leaving Mirs Bay, Commodore Dewey had received reports that Spanish Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasaron had ordered some of his warships to Subic Bay. The inlet was an ideal defensive position. The entrance was two miles wide, and in the middle of the bay was Grande Island that commanded both sides of the passage. About 4 P.M., our squadron was a few miles from Subic, when the sails of a small schooner, flying the flag of Spain, was sighted. It reached the entrance to Subic Bay just as the Boston and Concord were coming out. The Olympia, Raleigh and Petrel rushed to cut the schooner off, and quickly surrounded the vessel. The McCulloch was signaled to assign an officer to board the Spaniard. A dinghy, with Lieutenant Joynes and an interpreter, was sent over to the schooner. During questioning, the Spanish captain stated that he had not sailed from Manila, and did not know the location of any warships. At five o’clock, the Concord, Boston and Baltimore rejoined the squadron, and all ship captains were ordered to report aboard the Olympia. Captain Hodgsdon returned to the McCulloch an hour later. The serious look on his face showed that the commodore had decided on a definite plan of action. Preparations for getting underway were immediately ordered. Battle ports were put up. The only light visible was a tiny stern signal, enclosed in a box, so that its light could only be seen by the ship directly behind. Shortly before sunset, a remarkable cloud formation was observed on the western horizon. It represented, without imagination, the turret and gun of a naval vessel. Coming at a time like this, the superstitious sailors believed it to be either a premonition of victory or defeat.\n\nThree Days to Manila 2.2\n\n11\n\nCommodore George Dewey’s Route from Hong Kong to Manila Bay\n\nAs the sky darkened, shadowy groups of men could be seen moving silently about the deck and bridge. There was almost no sound. This was a perfect night for running past the forts at Corregidor. There were heavy gray clouds in the sky which effectively hid a half moon. It was only when lightning flashed that the dark silhouettes of our ships could be seen. It would take two or three hours for our squadron to arrive at Corregidor. All men not on watch were told to get some rest. Mattresses were scattered about the decks, and loaded revolvers and cutlasses were placed within easy reach. A few minutes after 10 P.M., the ship’s crews were sent to their battle stations by word of mouth. Every gun was manned. Rifles were distributed, and ammunition handlers received their assignments. There was nothing we could do now but wait!\n\n3\n\nThe Battle of Manila Bay, May 1, 1898 It was Commodore Dewey’s intention to pass the Corregidor Island forts before midnight without being discovered. But his worst fears were soon realized as John McCutcheon remembered: “About 11:30 P.M., the entrance to Manila Bay became visible. Two dark headlands—one on either side of the entrance— loomed out of the darkness. And, in the emptiness between, I could see the awesome fortress of Corregidor. The largest Spanish guns were rumored to be located here, and mines were said to be planted around the island. “The squadron steamed ahead silently, only the stern light of the ship to the front breaking the darkness. Behind the McCulloch, the blackness of night hid the Nanshan and Zafiro from view. Suddenly a small flash of light flickered in the distance. We raced toward the strange glow, but it only proved to be Saint Elmo’s fire dancing and darting around a buoy. “A few minutes later, the squadron turned into the Boca Grande Channel and approached Corregidor abeam to port. The enemy guns were silent, but the tension aboard the ships was intense. A shadowy, sleeping Corregidor, and the hills of the mainland, were watched with straining eyes. “Then, without warning, a bright flame belched from the McCulloch’s stack. Soot from the soft coal she was burning had ignited. The flames shot up like fire from a rolling-mill chimney. A faint light immediately appeared on Corregidor, followed by the flash of a rocket fired from the island, then darkness and silence. Nervous anxiety gripped the squadron. Time seemed to stand still. But we were not out of danger yet. A moment later, another spark of flame shot from the stack. There was grinding of teeth on the McCulloch. She was a perfect target, but the Spaniards took no action. We were directly between Corregidor and the shoreline of Luzon. The Boston was two hundred yards ahead of us. The other men-of-war had already entered Manila Bay.\n\nThe Battle of Manila Bay, May 1, 1898\n\n13\n\n“The strained pressure continued to build as our squadron steamed deeper into the enemy’s lair. On the McCulloch’s bridge, the hands of the ship’s clock touched midnight. It was now the first day of May. A flash of flame was suddenly spotted on the shore, followed by a white puff of smoke and the unforgettable scream of an artillery shell zooming overhead. It was fired at the McCulloch, but splashed well ahead of her. An order immediately came down from the bridge to load the aft starboard six-pounder. There was a short pause as the gun crew waited for instructions to commence firing, but the order never came. In its place, a sound like crashing thunder shook the air as the Boston launched an 8-inch salvo at the enemy position. “The Spanish battery quickly answered, sending another shell that landed a short distance in front of the bow. Irritated that the commodore did not have confidence in our gunners, Captain Hodgsdon sent a salvo of six-pounders racing toward the vague cloud of smoke rising from the dark hills off the starboard quarter. “During this exchange of fire, there was not one sound from Corregidor. We were surprised that shells had not been coming at us from both sides of the passage. “As soon as the McCulloch steamed into Manila Bay, she was directed to proceed at four knots toward the Cavite naval station—seventeen miles distant at the head of the bay. Commodore Dewey would attack at daylight.” Each ship in the American squadron was in a state of readiness. Every gun was loaded, and ammunition hoists were filled with shells. Officers on watch continually moved about, inspecting battle stations over and over again. Conversations were conducted in whispers so as not to disturb the men who were sleeping. In the Olympia’s publication, The “Bounding Billow,” Apprentice First Class Louis S. Young related his story of the Battle of Manila Bay. “About 3:20 A.M., word was passed to ‘lay by your guns and take it easy.’ The men laid by their guns, but taking it easy was out of the question. “The decks had been sprinkled with sand. It would get into the eyes, ears and nose, and scratch the skin. Occasionally, in the darkness, a sailor would stumble over the body of a sleeping man—then step over him leisurely as if on parade. There was no ‘I’m sorry’ or even an ‘excuse me.’ “At 12:17 A.M., an enemy artillery battery opened fire. A shell zoomed between the Olympia and Baltimore. The McCulloch sighted the gun’s muzzle flash and responded vigorously. After a short exchange of salvos, Commodore Dewey signaled Captain Hodgsdon, ‘Are you alright?’ Hodgsdon answered, ‘We are O.K.!’ The McCulloch was then ordered to remain with the transports instead of trying to win the war all by herself. “Coffee was served at 4 A.M. The long, hushed hours of silence were quickly broken with the clinking of cups and laughter occasioned by men bumping into each other in the dark. The Olympia’s crew was as happy as sailors on an excursion voyage. Jokes and so-called witty stories made the rounds. While,\n\n14 3.1\n\nAmerica at War Battle of Manila Bay, May 1, 1898\n\nevery now and then, a forlorn nightingull would break out singing a hearttugging rendition of ‘Just Before The Battle, Mother.’ A cup of cold water poured on the songster’s head quieted him down for a few minutes. But, despite the jolly mood, the determined look in the eyes of the crew showed that they meant business and were ready to do or die. “Commodore Dewey signaled the uniform of the day—war clothes, pants or shorts and shoes.” The American squadron—with bright-hued signal flags whipping in the wind—looked every bit like warships on parade as it headed for a date with destiny.\n\nThe Battle of Manila Bay, May 1, 1898 Table 3.1 The American and Spanish Fleets at the Battle of Manila Bay May 1, 1898\n\nAMERICAN SHIPS PROTECTED CRUISERS Olympia Boston Releigh Baltimore GUNBOATS Concord Petrel REVENUE CUTTER McCulloch CARGO SHIPS Nanshan Zafiro SPANISH SHIPS CRUISERS Reina Cristina Castilla Don Antonio de Ulloa Don Juan de Austria Isla de Cuba Isla de Luzon GUNBOATS General Lezo Marquis del Ducro Elcano Velasco Argus TRANSPORTS Isla de Mindanao Manila\n\n15\n\n16\n\nAmerica at War\n\nLouis Young continued: “We stood in toward the town to reconnoiter the harbor. Several foreign sailing vessels were anchored off Manila, but no menof-war were visible. “At fifteen minutes to five the squadron broke out Old Glory. We were immediately saluted with an angry salvo from a battery on the south bastion of the city. We did not return the fire, but headed for the navy yard at Cavite. “The Spanish fleet was sighted a few minutes later—the flame colored flags of Spain swaying listlessly from the mastheads. The enemy warships were stationed in a line from Sangley Point to the shoals near Las Pin˜as. Two vessels were anchored in Bacoor Bay on the south side of Cavite. The ships were protected by a large chain-covered boom, and barges filled with rocks. Admiral Montojo’s flagship, the Reina Cristina, was at the left of the line. “Suddenly, an enemy battery at Sangley Point opened fire. A shell quickly splashed in front of the Olympia. Commodore Dewey had given strict orders for us to hold our fire until an effective range had been reached The squadron continued to advance in line. The Olympia was followed by the Baltimore, Raleigh, Petrel, Concord and Boston. The McCulloch was stationed back in the bay as protection for the Nanshan and Zafiro.” From the Olympia’s forward bridge, Commodore Dewey directed the movements of his flotilla. The flagship’s commanding officer, Captain Charles V. Gridley, was in the conning tower waiting for orders to attack. As soon as the Olympia was 1,500 yards from Cavite, Dewey had his port five-inch battery turned toward the enemy fleet. Seconds later a shell burst above the flagship. A boatswain’s mate at one of the aft guns shouted “Remember the Maine!” and every sailor on deck echoed the cry. The commodore checked the distance with the gunnery officer, then glanced at his watch. The time was exactly five forty. He looked up at the conning tower and called out, “You may fire when ready, Gridley!” John T. McCutcheon described the action as he saw it from the decks of the McCulloch: “The shooting on both sides erupted violently. The roar of guns was continuous. Flashes of flame, geysers of water, and clouds of black smoke sent a rush of excitement through the American squadron. “The Reina Cristina showed up black and fierce in front of the enemy fleet. The Castilla was nearly abreast of her, and the Don Antonio de Ulloa rested slightly to the rear. Fronting Bacoor Bay were the Don Juan de Austria, Isla de Luzon, Isla de Cuba, and the Marquis del Ducro. Two gunboats, the General Lezo and the Velasco, steamed back and forth from the protection of Cavite. Occasionally, a small torpedo boat was seen darting from a river into Manila Bay and then back again.” The American squadron, steaming in a wide circle, fired bow and port guns as it passed the Spanish fleet. Then, forming a long ellipse, each ship brought its stern and starboard guns into play. Louis Young narrated. “We made a total of five complete circles of the bay\n\nThe Battle of Manila Bay, May 1, 1898\n\n17\n\nat distances varying from 5,000 to 1,500 yards—three times from the east and twice from the west. “We had just finished the first circle, when Commodore Dewey gave the order to fire on the Cavite arsenal. We bombarded the fortress, but our shells seemed to have little effect. The Spanish big guns continued to shoot at us. “On the second circle, the Reina Cristina made a valiant effort to get outside the boom and run down the Olympia. For a few long minutes, she was seemingly impossible to stop. But, our rapid-fire guns finally slowed her attack. Admiral Montojo swung his ship around, hoping to reach the protection of Cavite. At that moment, however, an eight-inch shell from the Olympia crashed through the Spaniard’s stern, plowed completely through the vessel, and exploded in her forward magazine. “A moment later, the Reina Cristina was in flames. Black smoke poured from her hull. The Spanish admiral hauled down the colors and transferred them to the Isla de Cuba. “The Spaniards fought courageously—many of them going down with their ship and firing their guns until the very last. Even among the horrors of battle, one could not help but admire the valor of the enemy. “On the next circle of the bay, the Boston stood motionless for ten minutes, as her gun crews fired their weapons as fast as they could load and aim. “One Spanish shell struck the Baltimore in her starboard side. It did not explode, but ripped through the hammock netting wounding six men—then raced across the deck, ran around a gun shield, and finally spent itself between two ventilators. The shell was later presented to the Baltimore’s commanding officer, Captain Nehemiah Dyer.” Throughout the fierce battle, the Spanish guns concentrated on the Olympia. Splashing shells continually hurled a deluge of water across the flagship’s deck, nearly drowning the gun crews. The other ships in the squadron thought that the Olympia was sinking. All they could see of her were jets of flame poking through heavy clouds of acrid smoke. Joseph Stickney was on the Olympia’s bridge at the time and described the action. “Our only salvation was the enemy’s poor marksmanship. Most of their shots were too high, and roared into the bay beyond. One Spanish projectile, however, exploded less than a hundred feet from the forward bridge. Hot flying shrapnel sliced the rigging over the heads of Commander Benjamin Lamberton and myself. A fragment of another shell—about the size of a flatiron—gouged a hole in the deck a few feet below where Commodore Dewey was standing.” The American squadron had just completed its fifth circle of the bay when Captain Gridley reported that there were only fifteen rounds per gun remaining for the Olympia’s five-inch battery. Not wishing to alarm the crew, Dewey signaled his squadron to withdraw for “breakfast.” (John McCutcheon stated that Dewey’s reason for withdrawing from the battle was to learn what damage had been suffered by his ships.) As the battle-weary fleet steamed beyond the range of Spanish guns, clearing\n\n18\n\nAmerica at War\n\nsmoke revealed the damage to Cavite and fires burning on several enemy vessels. Once safely out in the bay, Commodore Dewey held a conference with his squadron’s commanding officers. Ammunition was checked, and powder and shells were redistributed where necessary. Joseph Stickney voiced his opinion of the conflict: “We had been fighting a determined and courageous enemy for almost three hours without noticeably diminishing his volume of fire. As far as we could tell, there was no indication that the Spaniards were less able to defend themselves than they had been at the beginning of the engagement. “We knew that the Spanish had an ample supply of ammunition, so there was no hope of exhausting their fighting power even in a battle lasting twice as long. However, if we should run short of powder and shell, we might possibly become the hunted instead of the hunter. A gloom of desperation settled over the bridge of the Olympia. Dewey was disappointed by the results of our gunfire. Most of the shots were either too high or too low. On the fifth circle of the bay, the squadron was within 2,500 yards of Cavite. At that range and in a smooth sea, we should have had a great percentage of hits. However, as near as our spotters could judge, we had not crippled the enemy to any large extent.” While his ravenous sailors ate a hearty meal, Commodore Dewey scouted the Spanish shoreline with his binoculars. Heavy smoke partially obscured Cavite, but he was still able to make out the tall masts of ships flying the flag of Spain. Occasionally the sound of exploding ammunition could be heard in the distance. After his ships and men had rested for three hours, Dewey was ready to begin “Round Two” of the battle. Louis Young narrated: “At ten-fifteen the squadron prepared for another attack on the Cavite batteries. This time the Baltimore led the formation followed by the Olympia. The Raleigh and Boston formed on the right flank, and the Concord and Petrel on the left. “As we steamed toward Cavite, the sound of church bells could be heard coming from Manila. Curious spectators could be seen crowding the rooftops of buildings as if waiting to watch a pageant or play. “At 1,500 yards from the enemy, we opened fire. As the Boston and Raleigh moved up, the Olympia dropped back. The Baltimore stopped, and sent shell after shell into the Cavite stronghold. Within twenty minutes she had silenced the Spanish heavy guns. “The Boston and Raleigh steamed past Sangley Point, firing rapid-fire broadsides at the remaining fort. While, at the same time, the Petrel and Concord ran in behind the point and bombarded the enemy position from the rear, quickly reducing it to rubble. “The Concord fired a few rounds at the Spanish transport Mindanao. She had been run aground on the shoals off Las Pin˜as. After being assured that the vessel had been abandoned, Commander Asa Walker, the Concord’s captain, had his gunners use it for target practice. The ship was quickly set afire. “Only one Spanish warship slipped her moorings and steamed out to challenge\n\nThe Battle of Manila Bay, May 1, 1898\n\n19\n\nthe Americans. The captain of the Don Antonio de Ulloa nailed her colors to the mast, and in a brave but futile effort, engaged Dewey’s squadron. Within a couple of minutes, the Don Antonio de Ulloa became a funeral pyre. She sank in shallow water, her ensign still flying. A boat crew, sent over from the Petrel, removed the flag. It was later presented to Commodore Dewey.” With most of his fleet now sunk or burning, Admiral Montojo issued one last order to his officers, “Scuttle and abandon your ships!” The admiral then escaped to Manila in a small boat. John T. McCutcheon remarked: “About twelve thirty, a white flag was spotted flying over Cavite, and a signal was received from the shore that the Spanish had surrendered. When we heard the news, an explosion of cheers resounded through the fleet. There was a flutter of banners, and from every visible ship there were groups of shouting sailors. There was joy and exultation in every face and a gallant waving of flags that now seem more beautiful and inspiring than ever before.” After the boisterous celebrations had quieted down, Commodore Dewey notified his ships that there was still a war to be fought. Louis Young stated: “The Boston and Concord were ordered to remain off Cavite, while the rest of the squadron steamed up the coast to attack a shore battery that had made its presence felt throughout the engagement. But, just as we came within range, the Spaniards ran up a white flag. “One amusing incident that occurred during the height of the action showed what an utter disregard some of our men had for the seriousness of the situation. Two shell carriers aboard the Raleigh—both amateur musicians—would snatch moments between hustling ammunition to grab their guitar and violin, and strike up the inspiring song, ‘There’ll be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight.’ Even Captain Joseph Coghlan, skipper of the Raleigh, had to laugh at the comical scene. “As the sun set that night, its last rays rested like a blessing on Old Glory, waving proudly from the mastheads of Uncle Sam’s doughty warriors. “At dark, the shores around Cavite glowed bright with the flames of burning ships. The Reina Cristina and Castilla looked like skeletons. The fires consuming them made their bones appear black against the white-hot heat. In the flickering light, the devastation at Cavite took on a surrealistic look—like the gateway to Hades. Occasionally an ammunition magazine would erupt like a volcano, throwing its flaming debris high in the air, making a grisly picture of the horrors of modern warfare.” The morning after the American victory at Manila Bay, Commodore Dewey sent medical personnel from his ships over to Cavite to care for the wounded and bury the dead. Louis Young recalled: “The effects of our bombardment were simply frightful. Dead and wounded were scattered about the ground like leaves in autumn. One wounded Spaniard (he had his legs shot away) could speak some English. He was living in the United States, but when he returned to Spain on a visit, he was forced to join the Spanish Navy. He stated that most\n\n20\n\nAmerica at War\n\nof the ships in Admiral Montojo’s fleet had double crews—many of them volunteers from among local citizens, and that the total number of deaths would never be known. He also remarked that no sooner had a gun been loaded, than a storm of American shells would sweep away the gun crew. At the time that the Spanish admiral attempted to move his ship out into the bay, it received such a murderous barrage that the deck was one mass of exploding shells. The captain of the Reina Cristina was killed on the first salvo.” Amazingly, not one American sailor was killed in the naval battle, and only eight men were wounded. Commodore Dewey remarked: “This battle was won in Hong Kong Harbor. My captains and staff officers working with me planned out the fight with reference to all contingencies, and we were fully prepared for exactly what happened. Although I recognized the alternatives from reports that reached me—that the Spanish might meet me at Subic Bay or near Corregidor— I made up my mind that the battle would be fought right here that very morning, at the same hour, and with nearly the same position of opposing ships. That is why and how, at the break of day, we formed in perfect line, opened fire, and kept our station without mistake or interruption until the enemy fleet was destroyed.” Dewey’s victory at Manila Bay was unsurpassed in the naval history of that time. Never before had an entire fleet been destroyed without the loss of a ship or man of the attacking force. On May 10, 1898, George Dewey was promoted to rear admiral.\n\n4\n\nJoseph Montgomery’s Story “Colonel” Joseph Montgomery and “General” Duffy O’Ryan were a couple of soldier’s of fortune who were continually hunting up small wars. There was no shortage of armed conflicts throughout the world, and both men were much in demand. In one of his letters to Miss Rita Shield of New York City, Joe Montgomery described his ringside seat at the Battle of Manila Bay: “For months O’Ryan and I had been fighting up and down Luzon with the insurgent army. We liked the native people and they liked us. By early 1898, the Filipinos controlled all of Luzon except Manila, Corregidor and the area around Cavite. “Near the end of April, O’Ryan and I established our headquarters on the upper Bataan Peninsula—about thirty miles above Corregidor and directly across from the Spanish naval base at Cavite. “I was awakened about daylight on May 1 by heavy artillery fire. My first thought was that the Spaniards had mounted some long-range guns on Corregidor that could reach our position. But, as soon as I left my tent, I could see that the shooting was coming from the Spanish fleet and Fort Cavite. At first, I could not make out the reason for all the gunfire. But, then to my left, barely visible in the dim light, I could see a column of warships in perfect line approaching the Spanish anchorage at Cavite. By the time my aide brought me my field glasses, Duffy O’Ryan had joined me. “As the column of ships drew closer, I noticed that the first ship in line was flying the American flag. Both O’Ryan and I were puzzled. We could not understand what was happening. We had been in the jungle for weeks, and knew nothing of the outside world or the war between the United States and Spain. “With guns blazing, the American fleet turned broadside to Cavite, then swung back out into the bay, and circled for another attack. Suddenly there was a heavy explosion aboard one of the Spanish vessels. A moment later another\n\n22\n\nAmerica at War\n\nship burst into flames. Two small torpedo boats raced out from the protection of Cavite and headed for the American flagship—one was quickly sent to the bottom of the bay, and the other returned to base. We shouted and cheered and almost cried as each American shell found its mark. Here we were, two Americans, ten thousand miles from home, pulling for the navy of a country that would not allow us to return to the land we loved. “I should mention here that the U.S. Government had issued a warrant for our arrest for gunrunning and roughing up two secret service agents at Key West when they tried to arrest us. According to the government warrant, one of the agents had a broken jaw, and the other had a few crushed ribs and was missing an ear. We tried many ways to have the charges dropped and even offered to plead guilty and pay a fifty dollar fine. But the answer was always the same, ‘You cannot beat up United States Secret Service agents and get away with it. It is a penitentiary offense.’ “But, home or no home, it was still our country—our flag. The American ships took time out for breakfast, and then went back into action. By noon the Spanish fleet was no more except for two transports that surrendered. As I recall, the Spaniards lost about ten ships and a few hundred men. Our navy had a little paint scratched off the fenders of a boat or two and several sailors slightly injured. “After the battle, the American ships anchored in the bay near Manila. That afternoon O’Ryan had some native canoes filled with pineapples, bananas, coconuts and other fruit, and sent two boatloads to each of our warships. A few dozen chickens and three live pigs were added to the fleet commanders vessel. “As the heavily loaded canoes pulled away from the shore, I noticed that each craft carried a Filipino intelligence officer. I asked O’Ryan why all the food and secret agents. Duffy replied, ‘The intelligence officers will insist on delivering my compliments to the ship captains in person. That will give them a good looksee as to any damage.’ “The next day O’Ryan and I, wearing our dress uniforms and medals, boated out to the Olympia to pay our respects to Commodore George Dewey. The commodore and his crew were very courteous to us. We had met many of the ship’s officers and men during our ventures in Central and South America. They were very excited to have the well-known General Duffy O’Ryan and Colonel Joseph Montgomery visit the Olympia. “As we were leaving and pulling away from Commodore Dewey’s flagship, we were honored with a big-gun salute. I turned to O’Ryan, ‘They’re looking at us,’ I said. ‘Don’t count those salutes on your fingers! Let your brilliant intelligence officers do that!’ “O’Ryan smiled and sarcastically replied, ‘You should be in jail at Key West where you belong!’ “The next day, Commodore Dewey and his staff visited our headquarters. Several months later, O’Ryan was appointed to General Merritt’s staff, while I served with General MacArthur.\n\nJoseph Montgomery’s Story\n\n23\n\n“Regarding my long association with the general, in 1912 I was in Chicago, on the way to my Montana ranch. While waiting at the railroad station, I happened to meet General MacArthur, who was traveling to Milwaukee to attend a reunion of his old Civil War regiment. We had a grand visit, and talked over old times and old wars. “While having breakfast in the train’s dining car the next morning, a waiter handed me a newspaper. The first story that caught my eye was a shocker: ‘Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur, while making a speech in Milwaukee tonight to comrades of his Civil War regiment, fell over dead. Then, as his adjutant tearfully spread the regimental flag across the body, he also dropped dead on top of his general.’ “I’ll always remember my last adventure with O’Ryan. The French government of the Ladrone Islands was having trouble with a native chieftain, Datu Loco, who had been on the warpath for months. The French wanted us to join a column that they were sending out to capture him. We did not care much for going on this expedition, but the government officials had always been good to us, so we agreed to support the troops. “Upon entering enemy territory, we were ambushed by a large force of howling natives. The datu’s men were giving us hell! O’Ryan’s machine gun quickly overheated—mine jammed. Duffy shouted to me, ‘Go on and fix it! I’ll cover you with my .45!’ “Just as I got my weapon working, O’Ryan cried out, ‘Here, take my gun, I’m done for!’ “I could see by the grimace on his face that he had been hit hard. O’Ryan collapsed and died at my feet. That was when I saw—not ten feet in front of me—the body of Datu Loco riddled with .45 caliber bullets. “Duffy O’Ryan’s death ended my career as a soldier. A very grateful governor of the Ladrones confiscated all of Datu Loco’s land and gave half of it to Mollie O’Ryan—Duffy’s wife. Today, Mollie has one of the largest and finest indigo plantations in the world. She is probably the most well-known American in the Orient. Mollie has a beautiful home at the plantation and one at Manila. She goes back to Brooklyn each year to see a baseball game. “Although Mollie has many friends and great wealth, the item that she values most is a cablegram that reads: General Duffy O’Ryan Manila, P.I. Attorney General Knox advises me that there is nothing in his file which will prevent you and Colonel Montgomery, two great American soldiers, from coming back to the land you so courageously defended. Would be delighted if you would spend a weekend with me at the White House when you return. (Signed) Theodore Roosevelt, President.”\n\n5\n\nAfter the Battle: Reports from Cavite In a letter to the Chicago Record, John T. McCutcheon described his impressions of Cavite and the sunken Spanish fleet. May 3, 1898 In response to a signal from the Olympia, the McCulloch hoisted anchor and rejoined the squadron. About 7 A.M., the Petrel—which had been at Cavite completing the destruction of half-sunk ships—returned to our anchorage with six captured launches. As she steamed abreast of the Olympia she was greeted with rousing cheers from the flagship. Gazing through the morning mist, smoke could be seen rising from the city of Manila, and it is thought that either the Spaniards are destroying their supplies, or the Filipinos have begun burning and pillaging. Smoke is also curling from several points in the suburbs, and it may be necessary to land marines to protect the Spanish and other foreign residents. About noon, the McCulloch was sent over to Cavite with instructions to enter the harbor at Can˜acao Bay. We took a position in the center of the bay, where the larger Spanish ships did most of their fighting. The sunken hulk of the Reina Cristina rested 200 yards to our right, and the Castilla about the same distance off our stern. The wreck of the Don Antonio de Ulloa was 150 yards to the left. Only the masts, battered funnels, and parts of shattered decks showed above water. On the shore, two sailing craft had been toppled in shallow water. A single Spanish flag was still flying over a building at Sangley Point, but a number of white flags waved above various government facilities, and Red Cross ensigns had been raised over hospitals and churches. There are hardly any signs of life along the shore, and the day has taken on a Sunday quiet that is a welcome relief after the thrilling events of yesterday. Occasionally a few people can be seen. Several men were observed carrying bundles and packages as if\n\nAfter the Battle\n\n25\n\npreparing to leave the area. And, the sight of some nuns conducting a funeral ceremony emphasized the death and destruction visited upon the Spaniards by Commodore Dewey’s squadron. During the afternoon, I took a dinghy and visited the wrecks in the bay. The Castilla showed only one upright funnel and two charred masts. The second funnel was leaning across the standing stack. Only a few inches of shattered railing were visible above water. The hull was still burning in a few places where small sections of woodwork remained, and a blue haze of smoke drifted lazily from the smoldering embers. The Reina Cristina had also been completely destroyed. Her funnels were perforated, and large gaping holes in her steel framework showed the accuracy of the American gunners. Her 8-inch guns still poked above water, and a number of small guns could be seen fore and aft. I noticed the body of a Spanish sailor sticking halfway out of a gun barbette. His legs were shot off, and there were slashing wounds in his hip. It was in this ship that so many died. The hull must be choked with those who fell before the sweeping gale of steel that was poured into her. In a day or two, the bodies will be floating to the surface. I noticed a live chicken perched on a stanchion at the bow. How it lived through the barrage of shells, exploding ammunition magazines, and roaring flames was a miracle. The Don Antonio de Ulloa was not entirely submerged. Her forecastle and chart room were above water, and masts, though standing, were splintered by shells. Boatloads of officers and sailors were crawling all over her, searching for souvenirs of the battle. Signal and boat flags, charts, books, small anchors and dozens of other items were eagerly grabbed as valuable relics. Other men have been diving down into the wreck, and bringing up all kinds of trophies, from clocks and compasses to chairs and capstan heads. One sailor proudly waved the fretted stock of a guitar. It was evidently smashed by its devoted owner to prevent the invading American vandals from capturing it. At first, I thought the scene of devastation in Can˜acao Bay was the very worst, but a trip to Bacoor Bay revealed even greater havoc and ruin. This bay was the naval station’s principal anchorage, and the graveyard of seven warships—all sunk and most of them charred by flames. The nameplates of the vessels are either gone or submerged, but it is known that among them are the cruisers Don Juan de Austria, Isla de Luzon and Isla de Cuba and the gunboats Marquis del Ducro, General Lezo, Elcano, and Velasco. These ships were among the finest in the Spanish navy, and enough remained showing of them to indicate how excellently armed and cared for the vessels were. A number of six-inch guns were still above water, and seemed to be in good condition. Some of them were without breech plugs, and it is probable that the Spaniards threw them overboard before scuttling their ships. Meanwhile, boatload after boatload of Filipinos are swarming into Cavite, and, as the Spanish army has fled to Manila, they are free to pillage to their heart’s content. The bay is dotted with cascos (a long, rectangular barge), and many outlandish-looking native boats—loaded to the water level with mountainuous piles of plunder, and manned by dozens of broad-hatted, swarthy Filipinos. The following morning, I went with a party of surgeons to the Can˜acao hospital. We were met at the landing by the Spaniards who conducted us to the building, and the shock of seeing the awful suffering and misery of more than two hundred victims of the battle was something that I will never forget. The wards were jammed with hastily improvised cots and hospital beds that bore men with every conceivable kind of wound. Row upon row of beds, with men whose legs\n\n26\n\nAmerica at War\n\nand arms had been shot away, and whose bodies and faces were covered with bloodsoaked bandages, laid stretched on either side of the wards. Many thought that the Spaniards would show resentment and hatred toward the Americans, but such was not the case. There was a languid and appealing look of suffering on their faces, but no anger was observed. Those who were not seriously wounded, looked at us with curiosity and readily answered any questions asked of them. The surgeons said that the badly wounded were not ready to be moved to safety, but the Spaniards wanted a marine guard detachment to protect them from the Filipinos. The Spanish soldiers were fearfully afraid of the local natives, and were particularly apprehensive about powder magazines located near the hospital. Later that day, I walked from Can˜acao to Cavite, and passed hundreds of Spanish civilians—their carts loaded with household possessions—fleeing the Filipinos. At our guard posts, they freely surrendered pistols and knives, and seemed eager to have the Americans protect them. Every evidence of friendship that they could show us was exhibited. These were the common people—the soldiers had all fled to Manila. The streets of Cavite were littered with rubbish, and the Americans and Filipinos were stripping the naval base of everything that was not nailed down. Commodore Dewey landed a marine detachment to protect the hospitals and occupy the fortifications. I learned from a captured Spanish officer that the Filipinos had cut the cables between Corregidor and Cavite before Dewey’s squadron reached Manila Bay. For this reason, the Spanish fleet at Cavite was not aware that the Americans had entered the bay until the ships were sighted at daylight. The Raleigh and Baltimore were sent to Corregidor to capture the island’s fort and gun batteries. All the shore-based guns at Cavite are being destroyed, and the work of demolishing the fortifications and arsenal will begin immediately.\n\nIn the pages of The “Bounding Billow,” Louis Young described his impressions of Cavite: “Throughout the day on May 2, several small enemy vessels were captured—many of them carrying cattle and hogs which we confiscated as acceptable prizes of war. “Our squadron remained ready for further trouble, and night watches were permanently established to guard against attacks by Spanish torpedo boats. Commodore Dewey impressed upon our already over-burdened minds that this was war—in all its stern reality—and anyone caught ‘sleeping on watch’ would receive a lead passport to the ‘Land of Eternal Rest.’ This seemed uncivilized, but business is business, and a lack of vigilance could cost many American lives. “The Cavite Navy Yard is a rather imposing place, with several impressive buildings, along with storehouses, smithies, carpenter shops and barracks. The residence of the commandant was large and roomy, well furnished, and contained a splendid library. The lower floor of the house was devoted to the navy yard offices, and justice hall where severe punishment was meted out to lawbreakers. “The grounds of the yard were well laid out with footpaths and gardens ornamented by ancient cannons and pyramids of old cannon balls. The area\n\nAfter the Battle\n\n27\n\nabounds with groves of banana, mango, orange and magnolia trees, which give off a very pleasant aroma. “The arsenal itself was a beehive of activity, as the Filipinos were busy carrying away artillery pieces, ammunition and Mauser rifles. They appeared delighted at the defeat of their former rulers. The Americans were also rushing about like rabbits in a cabbage patch. However, they had a different agenda. Our sailors had been bitten by the ‘souvenir bug,’ and the ships quickly began to look like veritable curiosity shops, crammed with Spanish swords, bayonets, rifles, and anything else the men could haul aboard—with or without permission. “Below decks, the situation was quickly getting out of hand—buying, selling and trading the spoils of war. It did not take long, however, before Commodore Dewey put an end to the festivities. The following lines of poetry describe the excitement of the treasure hunt: They’ve got flags and scraps of iron, Tomahawks and bay’nets too, Soldier’s pants without the linin’ ’Nother’s got a woman’s shoe. They’ve got knives marked “Mi Amigo,” Which is Spanish for “my friend.” Swords and daggers marked “Toledo” That a Sandow couldn’t bend. Every man had shot or shell Which was added to his hoard. Some brought trophies they could sell To the suckers left on board. One sailor had a large ship’s bell That he claimed he won. And several others worked like hell To get a three-inch gun. There was a blunderbuss from sixty-seven which adorned some mantle piece Old socks and bits of ribbon, And a box of axle grease. There were admiral’s flags and pennants, That numbered o’er a score. All from the “R. Cristina,” Or so each owner swore. Some hauled off a coat of arms From the stately justice hall, And others took the mirrors That hung ag’in the wall. We expect to see more action, And lots of bloody scenes, But these are mild distractions Compared to the crazy souvenir fiends.\n\n6\n\nSpanish Reports: Call to Arms and Battle Accounts The following letter from the Spanish governor general, Basilio Augustin y Davila, was discovered posted on a bulletin board in the Cavite arsenal. It was translated from the Spanish and published in an issue of The “Bounding Billow.”\n\nApril 27, 1898 “SPANIARDS” Hostilities have broken out between Spain and the United States of North America. The moment has arrived to prove to the world that we possess the spirit to conquer those who—pretending to be loyal friends—take advantage of our misfortunes, and abuse our hospitality, using means which civilized nations regard as unworthy and disreputable. The North American people have exhausted our patience and provoked war with their acts of treachery, and with their outrages against the laws of nations and international treaties. The struggle will be short and decisive. The God of victories will give us one as complete as the righteousness and justice of our cause demands. Spain, which counts upon the sympathies of all the nations, will emerge triumphant from this new test— humiliating and blasting the adventurers from those States that, without cohesion and without a history, offer to humanity only infamous traditions, and the spectacle of a Congress united in insolence, defamation, cowardice and cynicism. A naval squadron manned by foreigners, possessing neither instruction nor discipline, is preparing to come to this archipelago with the ruffianly intention of robbing us of all that means life, honor and liberty. Pretending to be inspired by a courage of which they are incapable, the North Americans intend to take possession of your riches, as if they were unacquainted with the rights of property, and to kidnap those persons whom they consider useful to man their ships, or to be exploited as common laborers. Your indomitable bravery will suffice to frustrate their plans. You will not consent\n\nSpanish Reports\n\n29\n\nthat they shall profane your faith or that their unbelief shall destroy the Holy images that you adore. The aggressors shall not violate the tombs of your fathers. They shall not gratify their lustful passions at the cost of your wives’ and daughters’ honor nor appropriate the property which your hard work has accumulated to assure your livelihood. No, they shall not perpetrate any of those crimes inspired by their wickedness and greed. Your valor and patriotism will suffice to punish and shame the people that, claiming to be civilized and cultivated, have exterminated the natives of North America, instead of bringing to them civilization and progress. Filipinos, prepare yourselves for the struggle, and, united under the glorious flag of Spain, which is ever covered with laurels, let us fight with the conviction that victory will crown our efforts with the patriot’s cry of “Viva Espan˜a!”\n\nSpanish newspaper articles written about the Battle of Manila Bay are different from American accounts but add an interesting perspective to the sea battle. The following story was published a few days after the naval engagement in the Diario de Manila and translated into English by a member of the staff of The “Bounding Billow.” The translator stated: “To judge by the disconnected wording of the article, the writer must have viewed the battle from a pineapple orchard, or some other place of safety a good many miles distant.” The story was titled “A Naval Surprise” and has been edited for clarity. May 4, 1898 When the enemy squadron was sighted, steaming in a perfect line of battle, through the clouds of a misty dawn on the morning of the first of May, a feeling of surprise and despair spread quickly among the people of Manila. At last the American ships had boldly appeared on our coast, defying our batteries, which showed more courage and valor than effect when they opened fire on the attacking squadron. The inequality of our guns, compared to those of the enemy, alarmed the citizens of Manila and was enough to change the tranquil character of our tropical temperaments. Ladies and children, in carriages or on foot, fled in fright to seek refuge in the suburbs and adjacent villages around the capital. Every man from stately personage to the most humble workman, merchants and mechanics, Spaniards and natives, soldiers and civilians, all put on their arms, confident that the enemy would never capture Manila unless he passed over their corpses. Yet, from the first moment, the strength of the American armored squadron, and the power of its guns, demonstrated that its ships were invulnerable to our energies and artillery. The hostile fleet would never have entered our bay if they did not believe they had superiority. The city walls, church towers, roofs of buildings, and other places convenient for observation, were crowded by those who were not on military duty at the bridges or advanced posts. The slightest details of the enemy’s ships were eagerly noted as they approached Cavite in a line parallel with the beaches of Manila. There were no gaps in the line, but the\n\n30\n\nAmerica at War\n\ncurious public hardly realized the disparity between the American naval guns and the pieces mounted on our fortifications. Some of the spectators had spyglasses, but all seemed to devour with their eyes these strangers who, while brave, were not called upon to show their courage, since the range of their guns and the weakness of our batteries enabled them to attack us with impunity, while doing as much damage as they pleased to our ships and forts. All who watched the hostile ships maneuver, as if on parade, were full of rage and desperation such as belongs to the brave man who is unable to show his courage and to whom remains no remedy except an honorable death rather than cowardly inactivity. A soldier of the First Battalion of Cazadores gazed at the American squadron sweeping over the waters, out of reach of the fire of our guns. He looked out at the enemy ships, and then toward heaven, and cried out, “If Holy Mary would turn the sea into land, the Yankees would find out how we can charge in double time.” Another soldier staring out at the ships said, “Just let them come ashore, and give us a whack at them.” For more than an hour and a half, the bombardment held in suspense those souls who followed the unequal struggle, in which the Spanish ships went down with their glorious banners flying. From Manila, we could see, through spyglasses and binoculars, the two squadrons mingled together in clouds of smoke. This might have been a victory for our men, if our batteries had not been so weak. For, once alongside the enemy, the cry of “Boarders Away!” and the flash of cold steel could have enabled our devoted seamen to disturb the composure of the Americans. In the blindness of our rage, how should we paint the heroic deeds, the prowess, the waves of valor which burst forth from our men-of-war? Those who fought beneath the Spanish flag bore themselves like men—as chosen sons of our native land who would rather die with their ships, than live in ships that surrendered. To name those who distinguished themselves in battle would require the publication of the entire muster rolls of our fleet—from captain to cabin boy. To these brave seamen of ours, we offer congratulations—laurels for the living, prayers for the dead—and for all, our deepest gratitude. Since we cannot reconstruct the bloody scene which was exhibited last Sunday in the waters of Cavite, we will not attempt a description, which would only be a pale shadow of great deeds deserving a perpetual place in the pages of history. When the hostile squadron turned toward Cavite, our sailors heard the drums beating to quarters, and answered with three rounds of cheers for the King, for the Queen, and for Spain. Then absolute silence prevailed. The ships and their crews were ready. Any thought of death was lost in ardor for the fray, and every eye was fixed on the battle flags waving from our mastheads. The Yankee ships advanced in battle array. The Olympia, flying the admiral’s flag, led the enemy column steaming at full speed toward Cavite. The Olympia opened fire and received an instant reply from our harbor battery as the enemy flagship shaped her course for the Reina Cristina and Castilla. The Olympia, and the ships following in her wake, poured a steady and rapid fire into our fleet. The cannonading continued until a quarter to eight when, at that moment, the Don Juan de Austria advanced against the enemy, intending to attack and board the Olympia. But, a tremendous broadside stopped her charge. The captain of the Reina Cristina, seeing how this attempt had failed, dashed to within two hundred yards of the Olympia, when a sudden shower of shells swept her bridge\n\nSpanish Reports\n\n31\n\nand decks, littering the gallant vessel with dead and wounded. A thick column of black smoke from her bow compartment showed that an incendiary projectile—such as the law of God and man prohibits—had set fire to the ship. Mortally wounded, the Reina Cristina withdrew toward the arsenal, where she was scuttled to keep her from falling into the hands of the Yankees. The desperation of the men of the Reina Cristina was aggravated by the sight of the Castilla—also ablaze from a similar use of incendiary shells. The American vessels, some of them badly crippled by the fire from our ships and the battery at Sangley Point, withdrew toward the bay entrance, where their crews were busy repairing the damage to the squadron. At ten o’clock, the enemy returned to complete their work of destruction. In this second assault, the Cavite batteries were silenced, and the rest of our fleet was bombarded. During this attack, one Yankee gunboat—which seemed to have nothing more venturesome to accomplish—set to work to riddle the mail steamer Isla de Mindanao. Now that our ships were all in flames, Admiral Montojo—who had shown his flag as long as there was a vessel afloat—escaped to Manila, and hostilities ceased. The gunners of the batteries defending Manila and Cavite showed the highest degree of energy and heroism. Every Spaniard applauds these brave artillerymen who, by their calmness and skill, did all that was possible with the guns assigned to them. The battery that did the most damage to the enemy was the one at Sangley Point. One of its guns fired the shell that forced the Baltimore to withdraw from the fight. This gun must have greatly annoyed the Yankees, judging by the efforts they made to silence its fire. It has been proposed to bestow the laurel-wreathed Cross of San Fernando upon the brave gunners who served this battery. Admiral Montojo has received a telegram of congratulations from the Minister of Marine who—in his own name and the name of the Queen of Spain—saluted the Spanish Navy upon its gallant conduct at Cavite with the following statement: “Honor and glory to the Spanish Fleet that fought so heroically at Manila Bay.”\n\nA letter to the editor of The “Bounding Billow” correctly pointed out several errors in the Spanish newspaper’s account of the battle. “The story that appeared in the Diario de Manila is as fair as could be expected from a Spaniard, but a few statements were either untrue or exaggerated. For instance, in one paragraph, the writer states that the weakness of their batteries enabled us to do as much damage as we chose. No doubt. But he omits to say that only a few days before we arriv"
