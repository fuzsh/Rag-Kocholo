The purpose of this Strength Scale is to, eventually, put all the characters of the Marvel Universe in order, by raw physical strength.

This includes the amount of weight each listed character can lift over his/her head with arms fully extended (Overhead press) based upon information taken out of the various printings of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe and other encyclopedic comic books styled after the OHOTMU.

If this list includes any artificial augmentation of strength by way of outside forces such as telekinesis or mutagenic changes (such as Hulk's Gamma Ray bombardment) and Cosmic Energy (Such as Silver Surfer's Power Cosmic) it will be noted in parenthesis.

See also Superhuman Strength Category for a complete list of categorized articles.

These figures have been known to change from comic to comic, but these values are generally recognized as average for the character. In some situations characters are depicted as able to lift more than the stated weight but many of these situations arise when the character is under stress and is running on adrenaline.

Some figures listed for some characters have been taken from older sources but are still accurate, since more recent handbook and handbook-styled comics haven't printed information to contradict the figures taken from these older sources.

It should be noted that these values are strictly there for officially comparing different characters in relation to each other, and not remotely to be taken literally. For example, certain characters who have been listed at "95" or "100" tons at some point have demonstrated a planetary level of strength, and even Spider-Man has moved thousands of tonnes on occasion.
