Ratios of the within-person to between-person variance components of food intake from the two 3-day DRs are also included in . Overall, the de-attenuated correlation coefficients tended to be higher in the comparison between DR and FBC2, which was collected after the administration of DR, than in that between DR and FBC1. There was a reasonable level of correlation between DR and FBC2 in the intake of egg, milk, and fruits (r=0.53, 0.56, and 0.50, respectively). There was a weaker but still significant (p<0.05) correlation in the intake of vegetables and alcoholic beverages (r=0.31 and 0.45, respectively). No significant correlation was observed in the intake of meat, fish, confectionaries, and soft drinks. Stratified analysis by sex and age-group, however, revealed that meat intakes were valid to a reasonable degree in students (r=0.51), and to a lesser degree in fathers (r=0.37, ). There was also a reasonable level of correlation in the intake of alcoholic beverages in women (r=0.62 in students and r=0.59 in mothers). Intake of soft drinks in men had a weak but higher degree of validity compared to that observed in the analysis not stratified by sex and age-group (r=0.38). On the contrary, the correlation coefficient in the intake of vegetables in men was low (r=0.11) whereas those in women were comparable to the ones observed without stratification. Correlation coefficients in the intake of fish and confectionaries were lower than 0.30 in all sex- and age-groups. The number of subjects and their proportions, and mean intakes (g/day) from DR according to four response-categories of FBC1 and FBC2 are shown in . Actual intakes of vegetables by DR in those who answered in FBC2 that they consumed vegetables every day, 3-5 days per week, and 1-2 days per week were 173, 144, and 105 g/day, respectively (p<0.01, ANOVA).\n\nTable 4.\n\nσw2/σb2FBC1FBC2CrudeEnergy-, sex-, and age-adjustedCrudeEnergy-, sex-, and age-adjustedrrr*95% CIrrr*95% CIMeat7.23-0.04-0.05NI0.150.190.30(-0.08 – 0.92)Fish2.640.180.200.25( 0.03 – 0.58)0.120.130.18(-0.06 – 0.47)Egg1.900.220.220.34( 0.06 – 0.56)0.340.350.53( 0.20 – 0.77)Milk0.350.460.450.49( 0.30 – 0.68)0.510.510.56( 0.36 – 0.75)Vegetables0.900.140.150.18( -0.02 – 0.38)0.270.260.31(0.10 – 0.51)Fruits2.220.320.360.49( 0.21 – 0.84)0.390.370.50( 0.21 – 0.86)Confectionaries2.160.340.010.01(-0.22 – 0.25)0.160.010.01(-0.22 – 0.25)Soft drinks1.00-0.10-0.08NI0.140.170.20( 0.00 – 0.41)Alcohol0.340.600.390.42( 0.24 – 0.61)0.590.420.45( 0.27 – 0.64)\n\nTable 5.\n\nFBC1FBC2WomenMenWomenMenStudentsMothersFathersStudentsMothersFathers(n=47, age: 19-20 y.o.)(n=47, age: 39-53 y.o.)(n=47, age: 42-59 y.o.)(n=47, age: 19-20 y.o.)(n=47, age: 39-53 y.o.)(n=47, age: 42-59 y.o.)rr*rr*rr*rr*rr*rr*Meat-0.13NI0.030.06-0.05NI0.290.510.050.100.210.37Fish0.190.290.270.410.140.220.040.070.190.280.150.24Egg0.180.280.240.370.250.380.350.540.340.520.330.50Milk0.660.710.310.330.440.470.490.530.490.530.570.62Vegetables0.260.32-0.12NI0.210.260.350.430.090.360.300.11Fruits0.470.650.410.560.260.350.470.640.280.380.280.38Confectionaries0.050.060.150.200.270.350.190.250.020.02-0.04NISoft drinks-0.15NI-0.10NI-0.04NI-0.18NI0.240.290.310.38Alcoholic beverages0.600.650.550.590.420.450.580.620.550.590.410.44\n\nTable 6.\n\nFBC1FBC2Less than once\n\nper week1-2 days\n\nper week3-5 days\n\nper weekalmost\n\nevery dayp*Less than once\n\nper week1-2 days\n\nper week3-5 days\n\nper weekalmost\n\nevery dayp*n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)n (%)intake\n\n(g/day)Meat1\n\n( 0.7)6839\n\n(27.7)5580\n\n(56.7)6118\n\n(12.8)500.242\n\n( 1.4)6436\n\n(25.5)5275\n\n(53.2)5925\n\n(17.7)630.28Fish3\n\n( 2.1)5244\n\n(31.2)5677\n\n(54.6)6513\n\n( 9.2)770.232\n\n( 1.4)5155\n\n(39.0)6064\n\n(45.4)6318\n\n(12.8)730.54Egg2\n\n( 1.4)637\n\n(26.2)3362\n\n(44.0)3840\n\n(28.4)410.023\n\n( 2.1)1946\n\n(32.6)3154\n\n(38.3)3738\n\n(27.0)460.001Milk39\n\n(27.7)4836\n\n(25.5)8821\n\n(14.9)10844\n\n(31.2)144<0.00129\n\n(20.6)4538\n\n(27.0)6632\n\n(22.7)11542\n\n(29.8)146<0.001Vegetables010\n\n( 7.1)16632\n\n(22.7)13197\n\n(68.8)1690.04012\n\n( 8.5)10540\n\n(28.4)14589\n\n(63.1)1730.004Fruits6\n\n( 4.3)5859\n\n(41.8)4048\n\n(34.0)6428\n\n(19.9)97<0.00112\n\n( 8.5)3541\n\n(29.1)4545\n\n(31.9)5143\n\n(30.5)92<0.001Confectionaries36\n\n(25.5)5172\n\n(51.1)5018\n\n(12.8)6612\n\n( 8.5)620.8539\n\n(27.7)5564\n\n(45.4)4325\n\n(17.7)6313\n\n( 9.2)700.54Soft drinks54\n\n(38.3)39046\n\n(32.6)36521\n\n(14.9)28020\n\n(14.2)3620.2250\n\n(35.5)34739\n\n(27.7)35133\n\n(23.4)34019\n\n(13.5)4560.19Alcoholic beverages81\n\n(57.4)2316\n\n(11.3)5311\n\n( 7.8)21526\n\n(18.4)334<0.00180\n\n(56.7)1822\n\n(15.6)5414\n\n( 9.9)25825\n\n(17.7)322<0.001\n\npresents mean salt intake (g/day) according to the subjects’ preference for salty taste. The first four rows represent the salt intake measured by DR according to the four possible categories of FBC1. There was no significant difference in the intake of NaCl among the categories. Similarly, the next four rows represent the salt intake measured by DR by the four categories of FBC2. In this comparison using all subjects, the adjusted salt intake was 9.6 g/day for those who preferred and ate salty food, 9.4 g/day for those who preferred such taste but abstain, and 9.3 g/day for those who preferred a non-salty taste. Stratified analysis by sex and age-group (only women) showed that the adjusted salt intakes in both young and middle-aged women were higher in those who preferred and ate salty food (8.9 g/day and 10.2 g/day, respectively) than in those who preferred such taste but abstained (7.9 g/day and 9.2 g/day, respectively), or those who preferred a non-salty taste (8.6 g/day and 9.6 g/day, respectively). However, the differences among these means were not statistically significant. There was not any specific trend in salt intake in men.\n\nMean intakes of selected food groups and nutrients related to fat metabolism (g/day) derived from DR are presented in according to the subjects’ preference for fatty foods. Each column represents the crude or adjusted intake according to the three possible categories of either FBC1 or FBC2. There was a significant difference in meat intake (p<0.05) and a marginally significant difference in the intake of animal fat (p<0.1) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (p<0.1) between response categories of FBC2 and DR. Mean intakes of selected food groups and nutrients related to fat metabolism (g/day) according to the subjects’ meat and fish consumption are presented in . Those who answered on the FBC2 that they consumed mainly fish tended to eat less meat and less animal fat. Those who answered on the FBC1 that they consumed mainly fish tended to eat more polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. In addition, those who answered on the FBC2 that they consumed mainly meat tended to eat less fish fat. Cholesterol tended to be consumed more by those who answered that they consumed both fish and meat.\n\nTable 8.\n\nFBC1FBC2Prefer fatty tasteNeitherPrefer non-fatty foodp ‡Prefer fatty tasteNeitherPrefer non-fatty foodp ‡(n=19)(n=41)(n=81)(n=23)(n=40)(n=78)CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †Fish (g/day)53.053.556.854.959.860.70.5053.955.059.056.558.759.70.76Meat (g/day)65.365.859.658.156.056.60.2765.566.366.364.352.152.90.004Animal fat (g/day)18.718.920.219.818.518.70.6520.020.121.220.517.818.10.069Fish fat (g/day)3.83.82.92.83.73.70.163.33.33.43.33.63.60.84Vegetable fat (g/day)22.422.623.222.822.622.80.9923.123.223.723.022.222.50.81Cholesterol (mg/day)242.6242.4259.3256.6252.2253.60.86263.1265.6260.1255.1246.4248.20.73Saturated fatty acids (g/day)10.810.911.711.511.511.50.6511.711.712.312.010.911.00.12Polyunsaturated fatty acids (g/day)14.314.415.615.515.315.40.4715.415.416.616.314.614.70.067Monounsaturated fatty acids (g/day)10.410.411.110.910.910.90.7210.810.811.511.210.610.70.55\n\nTable 9.\n\nFBC1FBC2Mainly meatHalfMainly fishp ‡Mainly meatHalfMainly fishp ‡(n=26)(n=78)(n=36)(n=37)(n=72)(n=30)CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †CrudeAdjusted †Fish (g/day)51.251.859.258.766.166.50.1849.751.158.057.867.867.90.18Meat (g/day)57.958.561.060.551.451.60.2159.360.760.860.551.351.40.091Animal fat (g/day)18.719.020.220.016.716.70.03319.119.720.120.016.516.50.025Fish fat (g/day)3.13.23.53.53.93.90.552.72.73.83.83.83.80.066Vegetable fat (g/day)20.620.823.523.323.924.00.03921.622.222.922.723.623.70.69Cholesterol (mg/day)231.8231.0268.6268.1245.5246.80.12234.6235.8271.3270.9234.1235.10.075Saturated fatty acids (g/day)10.911.011.911.811.011.00.2211.211.611.611.411.311.40.38Polyunsaturated fatty acids (g/day)14.014.116.015.915.115.10.03414.614.915.715.615.015.00.23Monounsaturated fatty acids (g/day)9.89.811.211.211.611.60.00810.110.311.211.111.011.10.26\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we found a reasonable degree of reproducibility and validity in the items measuring intake frequency for some food groups. Comparing the sex-, age-, and total energy-adjusted intake of milk, eggs and fruits with that measured by FBC yielded de-attenuated Pearson’s correlation coefficients of more than 0.50. The Spearman’s correlations representing the reproducibility of these items were more than 0.60. The question for intake of alcoholic beverages could also be considered valid and reproducible. These figures are only slightly lower than those obtained from some previous studies using more detailed FFQs, although direct comparisons are inappropriate in a strict sense because of the difference in study design. In a study using a 102-item semiquantitative FFQ for Japanese foods with an 8-point scale, de-attenuated correlation coefficients were 0.49, 0.65, and 0.54 for milk, eggs, and fruits, respectively.6 Our results may reflect the fact that there is a large inter-individual variation in the intake of these foods in a population of Japanese adults, which was large enough to be detected by the scale of only four points. At the same time, summary food-group questions are suggested to perform better than summing across individual foods to assess total intake, perhaps because subjects are better able to describe frequency for more generalized categories than for specific foods.16 Even though validity and reproducibility for these items were considered reasonable, other studies reported higher correlations.7,10 This may be explained by the presence of milk or egg as an ingredient in a dish. In FBC, we only assessed weekly consumption of these foods without specifying portion sizes. There might have been differences in subjects’ interpretation of the question, with some responding that they had eaten milk or eggs only when these items were consumed alone, whereas others may have considered milk and eggs included as ingredients in prepared dishes in their responses, as well as when consumed alone.\n\nThere was an insufficient level of validity in the intake of soft drinks and confectionaries. Even in a detailed FFQ, however, reported correlations for validity were 0.17 and 0.33 for beverages excluding alcohol and confectionaries, respectively.6 Another study conducted in Japan also reported a correlation of 0.40 for confectionaries, which was below the median correlation coefficients (0.56) observed in the same study.7 Low mean intake frequency of soft drinks and confectionaries in this population probably prevented us from observing meaningful inter-individual variations. In addition, subjects may have underestimated their usual intake of these foods because they are considered to be less healthy,10 which may have further attenuated the validity. The lack of correlation between FBC2 and DR in the intake of soft drinks in young women, i.e., the students of the dietician course, who probably have greater than average knowledge about health, may have been partly due to this possibility.\n\nThough the reproducibility measured by kappa statistics was 0.41 (fair agreement), we did not find significant differences in salt intake among the categories of salty taste preference. Drewnowski et al. found that salty taste preference was unrelated to sodium intake.32 Nagata et al. found a significant, but small difference in sodium intake by preference only in women.33 In addition to the fact there is still uncertainty as to whether two 3-day DRs can correctly measure sodium intake,34 there is a possibility that some responses were affected by respondents’ knowledge of desirable answers in terms of health. It is also possible that subjects may have regarded the general Japanese term “koi aji” as including other tastes, such as strong or heavy tastes. Therefore, we should be careful in interpreting this result. Further studies are needed, including those using biological markers, such as measurement of urinary salt excretion or other dietary assessments.\n\nMore interestingly, those who replied that they consumed mainly fish rather than meat did eat significantly less meat and animal fat. Likewise, those who did not prefer fatty foods consumed significantly less meat, animal fat, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. These food behavior items that are not directly related to a specific food intake seemed to be surrogate measures of consumption. Similar findings were obtained by Murphy et al. using a 39-item food behavior checklist.12 This finding may be useful because if one food behavior can be a surrogate measure of consumption of many foods, inquiring about that specific food behavior can save time and paper. Moreover, the result of epidemiologic or clinical studies dealing with these kinds of food behavior may be directly related to dietary recommendations.\n\nThere are several limitations of the FBC. First, the maximum frequency category of the FBC was “almost every day”, which may have limited the ability of the questionnaire to discriminate between individuals with very high consumption from those with somewhat high intakes.8 For example, mean intake frequencies of vegetables were 0.84 and 0.86 per day in FBC1 and FBC2, respectively, and most subjects claimed to consume vegetables almost every day. The validity and reproducibility in the intake of vegetables were somewhat insufficient, and these values were lower than previous reports using fruit and vegetable modules17 or short food frequency questionnaires.16 In these two previous reports, subjects were asked to indicate the number of times vegetables were consumed per day, week, month, or year. A skewed distribution of the response seen in the present study was probably the reason for the lack of validity. However, because there was a significant difference in the mean intake of vegetables by the frequency category of the question, it is probably useful to screen low intake individuals from the population.\n\nSimilarly, correlations representing validity of the intake of meat and fish were not high. Responses to either meat or fish were skewed to middle categories, indicating that these items would be useful to discriminate, or to screen populations with extremely high or low intakes. However, for the purpose of an epidemiologic study exploring the main effect of a food on health statuses, FBC should be able to rank individuals by level of intake.10 Thus, information on these food items should be collected in more detail in terms of the intake frequency and serving sizes.\n\nSecond, the FBC did not specify the preceding period during which the food items were consumed. The subjects were asked to recall their usual diet since the FBCs were designed to obtain crude measures of usual diet intake. However, the lack of reference time period may have contributed to the somewhat low correlations observed because the time when the DR was carried out may not be included in the reference time period for some subjects.\n\nThird, the FBC did not collect data on portion sizes, nor specify unit sizes of servings for each food item. It is reported that the concept of “usual” portion size varies significantly by individual,8 and so the lack of serving size information in several items would have limited their ability to detect between-person differences.\n\nOther methodological issues should also be kept in mind when interpreting the present findings. First, only six days of dietary record may not accurately reflect a person’s usual diet. Therefore, we have corrected the correlation coefficient between FBC and DR by adjusting for the random within-person variation. This theoretically provides a value similar to that obtained with a large number of replicates.31\n\nThe study subjects were a dietician course students and their family members, and may have been more accurately understood, recalled or reported their diet than general population. This may have resulted in overestimation of the validity coefficients. It is often practically difficult to obtain DRs in a random sample of the general population, because accurately completing DR is a task requiring some knowledge.\n\nThere may have been a learning effect of keeping DR in FBC2. As shown in , the correlations between FBC2 and the DR were stronger than those between FBC1 and DR. It is possible to consider that this may be due to increased consciousness of one’s own diet through the practice of recording food intake as well as the fact that FBC is based on memory of one’s past diet.\n\nThe interval between FBC1 and DR was longer than that between FBC2 and DR. It is possible that the higher correlation coefficients observed between FBC2 and DR may be due to this difference in survey intervals.\n\nAlthough we performed transformation of dietary variables to increase normality in computing the Pearson’s correlation coefficients, the criticism may be raised that a nonparametric method (e.g., Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients) should have been employed instead. Therefore, we have confirmed that this alternative method yielded an almost identical result (data not shown). We have also presented the mean intakes of each food item by the 4-response categories. This additional analysis provided analogous results regarding the validity of FBC.\n\nThe intakes of several food groups and nutrients were compared and listed according to the subjects’ preference for fatty taste and meat/fish dietary pattern. Although these comparisons were planned in advance, the possibility remains of finding chance associations due to multiple statistical tests. Therefore, biological plausibility, evidence of a dose response, and consistency of the result within and across studies must be considered in interpreting the present findings.35\n\nFinally, because mean energy intakes as well as average intakes of vegetables, fruit or meat by DR are lower compared to those of same sex- and age-group from a dataset with a representative national sample,36 underreporting in DR may have occurred. Although the absolute intake is not of major interest in the present study, i.e., relating FBC to DR, caution is needed in interpreting the results. This is because if food groups presented for the DR did not capture important contributors to total energy intake, important associations between DR and FBC may have been missed.\n\nIn summary, the present results are of value because they help to clarify the abilities and limitations of a simple FBC. In application, the collection of data on egg, milk, fruit or alcohol intake by a simple FBC is justified. The intake of vegetables, meat and fish should be assessed with a scale having more points and questions on portion sizes. However, the FBC may still be useful in screening high or low intake individuals for these items. Asking preferences for fatty taste or assessment of food intake patterns, such as for meat or fish, may also be useful."
