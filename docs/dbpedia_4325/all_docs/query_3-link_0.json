        "text": "University in Japan\n\nNanzan University (南山大学, Nanzan daigaku) is a private, Catholic and coeducational higher education institution run by the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) in the Shōwa Ward of Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It is considered to be one of the most prestigious private universities in the Chūbu region.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNanzan is named after the forested mountains near Goken'ya-chō (五軒家町), known as Minamiyama (南山), which literally means \"southern mountain\". The on reading for \"南山\" is Nanzan. Also, in Chinese poetry \"南山\" refers to Mount Lushan until the Tang dynasty and Mount Zhongnan thereafter. Notably, the word appears in the classical poetry collection Shi Jing and the works of famous poet Li Bai. Thus, the choice of name is a celebration of longevity, perseverance, and prosperity for both the school and its alumni.[2]\n\nDivine Word Missionary Josef Reiners founded Nanzan Junior High School in 1932. Nanzan Foreign Language School was added to the Nanzan system in 1946. Later, as the Society of the Divine Word appointed Rev. Ralph Thyken, the American representative of Fu Jen Catholic University, to Japan to participate in the establishment of a new Nagoya Catholic University,[3] and Nanzan Foreign Language School was formally renamed Nanzan University in 1949.\n\nLocated to the east of the campus is the Divine Word Seminary Chapel, constructed in 1962. This is a building that exploits the plastic capacity of concrete, with two intersecting shells forming a bell tower. These are punctured with vertical slots which allow light to radiate along the curved interior walls.[4]\n\nNanzan Junior College (南山短期大学, Nanzan Tanki Daigaku) opened in 1968 as a women's junior college affiliated with the university. In 2011 the junior college campus was closed and reorganized as a department on Nanzan University's Nagoya campus offering courses in English language.[5]\n\nIn 1995, Nagoya Seirei Junior College was subsumed by Nanzan when the two schools' organizations merged.[6] In 2008, Nanzan planned to open an elementary school, officially named Nanzan University Affiliated Elementary School.\n\nIn 1961, Czech architect Antonin Raymond was commissioned to design most buildings on the Nagoya campus. It was one of the largest projects that he would undertake. The campus was orientated on a north–south axis across rolling hills and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the typography and harmonise with the landscape. In-situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form, some with pilotis, others with shells.[7]\n\nOrganization\n\n[edit]\n\nNanzan University is part of Nanzan School Corporation (南山学園, Nanzan gakuen), an educational complex of four high schools, and the university itself. Among coeducational universities, Nanzan is the only Catholic missionary school in the Chūbu region.\n\nNanzan has an active study abroad program with over 100 partner universities around the world. The Center for Japanese Studies opened in 1974, and is now one of the most prestigious Japanese language programs in Japan, accepting over 300 students a year into its fall, spring and summer programs.\n\nFor many years, Nanzan has held an annual competition with its Catholic sister schools Sophia University (上智大学, Jōchi daigaku) primarily focusing on athletics. Combining the first two syllables in Japanese of the respective schools, the Nanzan-Sophia event is known as the Jōnan-sen (上南戦) .\n\nThe humanities department offers priest training courses through its Christian studies curriculum.\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nNanzan's campus is in Yagoto, in the eastern part of Nagoya, in Shōwa-ku. The campus is about a 10-minute walk from either Nagoya Daigaku (名古屋大学) or Yagoto Nisseki (八事日赤) station on the Nagoya Municipal Subway's Meijō Line. Alternately, campus is a 15-minute walk from Irinaka (いりなか) on the subway's Tsurumai Line.\n\nFaculties and departments\n\n[edit]\n\nHumanities\n\nChristian Studies\n\nHuman Culture\n\nPsychology and Human Relations\n\nJapanese Cultural Studies\n\nForeign Studies\n\nBritish and American Studies\n\nSpanish and Latin-American Studies\n\nFrench Studies\n\nGerman Studies\n\nAsian Studies\n\nEconomics\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nLaw\n\nPublic Policy\n\nScience and Technology\n\nSoftware Engineering\n\nData Science\n\nElectronics and Communication Technology\n\nMechanical Engineering and System Control\n\nGlobal Liberal Studies\n\nGraduate schools and programs\n\n[edit]\n\nHumanities\n\nChristian Thought\n\nReligious Thought\n\nAnthropology\n\nEducational Facilitation\n\nLinguistic Science\n\nInternational Area Studies\n\nEconomics\n\nEconomics\n\nManagement\n\nPolicy Studies\n\nLaw\n\nSciences and Engineering\n\nSystems and Mathematical Sciences\n\nSoftware Engineering\n\nMechatronics\n\nData Science\n\nNanzan School of Law\n\nLegal Practice\n\nNotable alumni and students\n\n[edit]\n\nRyohei, R&B singer.\n\nMasato Hayakawa, frontman of rock band Coldrain.\n\nHome Made Kazoku, hip hop trio.\n\nSakon Yamamoto, racecar driver (currently enrolled).\n\nKazuki Nakajima, racecar driver (currently enrolled).\n\nAffiliations\n\n[edit]\n\nNanzan is a member of the ASEACCU (Association of Southeast and East Asian Catholic Colleges and Universities), an organization of Catholic institutes of higher learning in the Philippines, Australia, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia and Japan.
