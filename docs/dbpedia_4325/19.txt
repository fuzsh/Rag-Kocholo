About Nanzan University:

Nanzan University (南山大学 Nanzan daigaku) was founded by Josef Reiners, a Divine Word Missionary, as Nanzan Junior High School in 1932. Subsequently, Nanzan Foreign Language School opened in 1946, and became Nanzan University in 1949. In 1995, Nagoya Seirei Junior College was added to Nanzan when the two schools merged.

Among coeducational universities, Nanzan is the only Catholic missionary school in the Chūbu region.
