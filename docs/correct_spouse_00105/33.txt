Emmy-nominated Christel Khalil (Lily Winters) and her husband, Stephen Hensley, are the proud parents of a little boy.

Hensley broke the good news via Twitter, revealing that little Michael Caden Hensley was born on April 17, and weighed in at 6 lbs., 6 oz.

Khalil and Hensley were married in September 2008.

Khalil joined the cast of The Young and the Restless in 2002 before leaving the show in 2005. She returned a year later. During her tenure with the top-rated CBS soap, Khalil has twice been nominated for a Daytime Emmy.
