Maybe there's something in the Genoa City water! The baby boom continues for the cast of The Young and the Restless.

Emmy-nominated Christel Khalil (Lily Winters) has announced that she and her husband, Stephen Hensley, are expecting a baby boy. The little one, which will be the couple's first, is expected sometime in the early spring.

Khalil and Hensley were married in September 2008.

Several of Khalil's co-stars have made baby news of their own recently. Thad Luckinbill (J.T. Hellstrom) and Amelia Heinle (Victoria Newman) recently had their second child [Click here for the story], and Michelle Stafford (Phyllis Summers) welcomed her very first little one [Click here for the story].

Khalil joined the cast of The Young and the Restless in 2002 before leaving the show in 2005. She returned a year later. During her tenure with the top-rated CBS soap, Khalil has twice been nominated for a Daytime Emmy.
