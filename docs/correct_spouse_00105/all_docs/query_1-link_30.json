        "text": "While retirement is frequently the focal point of financial plans, we’ll also consider the many milestones you’ll experience. Weddings, births, graduations, promotions, family vacations, buying a new home and leaving a legacy should all be included in your long-term plan, as should the other, less predictable “detours” on the path to long-term success too – divorce, becoming a widow and retirement to name a few.\n\nWe know that your life, your goals, your dreams are yours alone, and we’re proud to be by your side as you work toward them. We understand there’s not one single mold every woman investor fits into, and we also recognize the realities women investors exclusively face. By working together, you’ll have the comprehensive resources, longstanding support and thoughtful sounding board you need to plan for more – more control, more possibility and more of what matters to you.\n\nServices Include\n\nWealth & Investment Management\n\nBanking & Lending Solutions1\n\nInsurance & Annuities2\n\nLegacy Planning\n\nWealth Transfer\n\nRisk Management\n\n1Lending Services provided by Raymond James Bank, member FDIC, affiliated with Raymond James Financial Services and Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
