        "text": "Jeffrey S. Hensley Jeffrey Stephen Hensley passed away suddenly Saturday evening, July 20, 2013 at his home in Atascadero, California. He was 47.\n\nJeff was born August 31, 1965 in Pasadena, California, the son of James Hugh and Marie Venne Hensley. He was raised in Pasadena, Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills Estates and graduated from Rolling Hills High School. He attended Harbor Community College and graduated from California State University, Dominquez Hills with a degree in Communications-Television Studies and a minor in Journalism. He was very proud of his top honor award in the California Collegiate Student Media Festival for his film, “A Line in the Sand”, Best Documentary News Feature.\n\nA resident of the Morro Bay and Central Coast area for the last twenty years, his professions included videography as well as the local bicycle industry including ownership of Morro Bay Cyclery and pro mechanic positions at Neuvation Cycling and Cambria Bicycle Outfitters. He was very mechanical and always called himself a knucklehead. His interests included his extensive vinyl album collection, love of vintage motors and radios and being amongst nature, especially the locale of his last residence. His good nature, funny personality, quick wit, sense of humor and creative and innovative ideas will be missed. Jeff, being the kind-hearted soul that he was, was always a tireless, giving, and selfless volunteer to any person or situation. He was a member of the Cayucos Lions Club and thoroughly enjoyed giving back to the community. On August 27, 2011 at a beautiful barn setting in Cayucos, California, Jeff married Brittany Jayne Keatts.\n\nJeff is survived by his wife, Brittany of Atascadero, CA; his parents, James and Marie Hensley of Carlsbad, CA; his sister, Leslie Hensley of Kirkland, WA; his son, James Hensley (18), daughter, Emma Hensley (15) and his children’s mother, Pamela Hensley all of Morro Bay, CA; uncle and aunt Bill and Carol Venne of Windsor, CO; father and mother-in-law, Ken and Katrina Keatts of Paso Robles, CA and brother and sister in-law, Garrick and Tera Keatts of Denver, CO. Jeff also leaves a huge circle of friends locally on the Central Coast and throughout California.\n\nA private inurnment will be held at the Cayucos-Morro Bay District Cemetery in Cayucos, California. A Celebration of Life will be held on August 10, 2013 at Last Stage West Restaurant, 15050 Morro Road (Hwy 41), Atascadero, California at 4 p.m."
