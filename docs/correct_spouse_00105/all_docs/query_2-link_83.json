        "text": "Robert Lee Hensley\n\nJuly 16, 1932 ~ August 10, 2017\n\nRobert Lee Hensley, peacefully returned to his heavenly home on August 10, 2017 at the age of 85.\n\nBob was born on July 16, 1932 in Helper, Utah to Frank George Hensley and Nellie Esther Lemmon. He grew up with the help of many aunts, uncles, and grandparents. In 1949, Bob enlisted in the United Sates Air Force and served his country with pride.\n\nHe married “the love of his life” June Dykster on June 4, 1953. Their marriage was later solemnized in the Ogden LDS Temple. They enjoyed traveling together and making many memories throughout their 55 years of marriage. In their early married life, times were challenging while raising four young children. Their life together was not about “waiting for the storm to pass, it was about dancing in the rain.” Together they knew how to light up the dance floor. Bob loved his wife above and beyond all else; he tenderly cared for June during her illness. June passed away in April of 2008 taking a little piece of his heart.\n\nIn 1957, he began his 50 plus year career at Weber Basin Water Conservancy District. He worked as the Superintendent for over 20 years. In June 1998, he was appointed a member of the Board of Directors, where he served for 14 years. Those he worked with praised him on his ability to guide and direct each project.\n\nBob was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served faithfully in his church callings.\n\nHe was a self taught man who always took the opportunity to share his knowledge with others. Some of Dad’s greatest attributes were his courage and kindness. He treated everyone he met with respect and dignity. Dad was a true Gentleman! His lifetime motto of “You’re never in better company than when you’re with family” was exemplified in the way he lived. His legacy will live on.\n\nRobert is survived by his children, Stephen (Sydnee) Hensley, Bob (Paula) Hensley, Lynda Hensley, and Julie (Larry) Bench; 14 grandchildren, 33 great-grandchildren, brothers, Darrel O. (Jeanne) Larsen, and Rodney (Robin) Larsen. He was preceded in death by his wife, June; and great-grandson, Cole Bench.\n\nOur family would like to thank the hospice team (HCNU) and Seniors Helping Seniors for their loving care and support. Our deepest gratitude to Lynda and Glenn for keeping him active and caring for him the past few years.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Friday, August 18, 2017 at 11 a.m. at the Pleasant Valley Stake Center, 5640 South 850 East, Ogden. Friends may visit with family on Thursday from 6 to 8 p.m. at Lindquist’s Ogden Mortuary, 3408 Washington Blvd. and Friday from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. at the church. Interment, Lindquist’s Memorial Gardens of the Wasatch, 1718 Combe Rd."
