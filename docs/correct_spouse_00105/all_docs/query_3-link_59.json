        "text": "Carl Hensley, 85, of Titusville, Florida, left this world to be with Jesus on Sunday, March 22, 2020 at the Parrish Medical Center in Titusville, FL. He was born in Bar Creek, KY near Oneida on December 16, 1934. Carl graduated from Oneida Baptist Institute in 1954 when the former OBI President, Dr. Barkley Moore was in the 9th grade.\n\nCarl Hensley was as a \"Patriot and a Man of Humility\" that loved his Country like no other. He proudly served in the United States Air Force as a Radar Technician during the Korean War Era and he encouraged two of his Grandchildren, Michelle Hensley and Luke Berg to join the Air Force. He then used his Radar Technician skills to spend 32 years with General Electric to operate, maintain, and build Radar Centers in the United States during the peak of the Cold War. Carl had an amazing sense of humor and he loved to hunt and fish. An avid golfer, Carl enjoyed playing golf with his brother Chuck and Sister-in-Law Kay Hensley of Radcliff, KY. He enjoyed playing golf at the Annual Hensley Open at the Big Hickory Golf Course in Clay County. The Hensley Open members included his son's Carl Dean, Allen Craig, Darryl, and Jon. He was a member of the American Legion Post 001 in Titusville, FL and frequently spent time with Veterans at the Stanley Beane Post 99 American Legion in Bingham, Maine. He was also very proud to be a member of the Commission of Kentucky Colonels, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\nPrior to his passing, Carl rededicated his life to Jesus and led his immediate family in prayer at his bedside at the Titusville Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Titusville, FL. Carl Hensley was now the family prayer warrior. He repeatedly surprised his Nurses and Doctors because he knew that he had one last mission to accomplish, to dedicate his life to God and to be an example for others to follow. Everyone that had the privilege and honor to know this wonderful man will miss him dearly. Thankfully, his wonderful Christian parents taught him the \"foundations of faith\" that led Carl Hensley back to the forgiving love of Jesus.\n\nHis loving wife Betty Hensley of Titusville, FL survives Carl Hensley along with his former-spouse Georgie Hensley of Cut Bank, Montana and brothers Corbet Hensley; Hezekiah; and Jimmy Ray all of Manchester, Kentucky and his sister Ruby Wilkerson of Port Royal, South Carolina. Carl is also survived by his five children: Carl Dean and his girlfriend Nancy of Bingham, Maine; Darryl Wayne and his wife Suzanne of Hermosa Beach, California; Allen Craig and girlfriend Sue of Bingham, Maine; Jon Erling and his wife Kate of Wilmington, New York; and Teri Lynn (Berg) Hensley of Cut Bank, Montana. He is also survived by his five stepchildren, Tammy Messer of Bingham, Maine; Laurie Murphy of Auburn, Maine; Valerie Lockard Travers of Lewiston, Maine; Tina Rowell of Belfast, Tennessee; and Stephen Lockard of Skowhegan, Maine. Finally, he is survived by nine Grandchildren; five Step-Grandchildren; three Great Grandchildren and four Step-Great Grandchildren. Carl Hensley loved them all dearly.\n\nPreceded in death by his loving parents Ambrose and Zuby Hensley, seven siblings, Thelma; Mary Faye; Doris; Elbert; Russell; Chuck, and Herb and his precious Step-Granddaughter Andrea Messer.\n\nA Celebration of Carl's Life will take place at the Hensley Family Reunion this summer on July 11th, 2020 at 2:00 PM at the Rominger Funeral Home in Manchester, Kentucky. Military Honors will be rendered at the Blevins Hensley Cemetery following the service. Rev. Henry Deaton will officiate Carl's celebration of life. In lieu of flowers the Hensley Family has requested donations be made to the American Heart Association www.heart.org"
