        "text": "The author (Marty Grant) is not related to Isom Hensley as far as can be proven. He did live in the same county (Scott Co., VA) as my ancestor Larkin Hensley (c1761-1806), though he moved there several years after Larkin died.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Jim Brown, Peg Shannon, and Ruthe Muench for information shared on this family.\n\nIsom Hensley was born ca 1797/98 per his age of 52 on the 1850 census. The 1860 and 1870 census show him as 61 and 71 both of which works out to ca 1798/99.\n\nHe was born in Tennessee per the same sources (1850, 1860 & 1870 census.) I would suspect he was born in Sullivan County, though Hawkins is also a possibility, but I believe his father was in Sullivan in the 1790's.\n\nI have seen no direct proof of who Isom Hensley's parents were, but it seems very likely that he is a son of Isom Hensley (1760/70-1849). This is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, though quite compelling. They were both in the same area for many years, Isom Sr's other children (also not proven) were associated with Isom Jr, and so forth. This isn't solid evidence that Isom Jr is a son of Isom Sr, but it is the best we can find at present. I am quite confident that it is correct.\n\nIsom Hensley would have been about 2 years old by the time of the 1800 census. Unfortunately this census is lost for Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nIsom Hensley would have been about 12 years old by the time of the 1810 census. Unfortunately this census is lost for Tennessee and much of Virginia. He lived in Scott Co., VA later on. In 1810 Scott didn't exist yet, but the territory was still part of Washington, Lee and Russell Counties. The 1810 census survives for Washington, but not Lee and Russell. There were Hensleys in Washington County in 1810. Isom Sr was not listed there, and I suspect he was still in Tennessee at that point, and so was his probable son Isom Jr.\n\nLooking at those Hensleys in Washington Co., VA in 1810. Two of the five have sons about Isom's age: William Hensley (1765/84) had two boys aged 10-15 (1794/1804). Either of those could easily be Isom Hensley (c1798). Fielding Hensley (1761). had one son that age. I seriously doubt Isom was a son of William or Fielding. The primary reason is that they lived in the eastern part of Scott County near the Washington County line, whereas Isom and his kin lived in the central part on the Tennessee line. This doesn't preclude them all being related, but it suggests some distance.\n\nIsom Hensley would have turned 16 years old around 1814 or thereabouts. He does not appear on the Scott County tax lists until 1825, so he was probably still in Tennessee up until that point.\n\nIsom Hensley would have been about 22 by the time of the 1820 census. He was not listed on his own, at least not in Virginia. He was probably still in Tennessee at this point. Unfortunately the 1820 census is lost for Eastern Tennessee including Sullivan and Hawkins Counties.\n\nSometime before ca 1820 Isom Hensley married Jane McDavid either in Scott Co., VA or Hawkins Co., TN. She was born ca 1799/1800 per her age of 50 on the 1850 census (and 60 and 70 on the 1860 and 1870 census). Those same records show her born in Tennessee. I have seen no proof that she was a McDavid, but Jim Brown and others believe so, and it does fit. Michael McDavid (1760/70) was a neighbor of theirs for many years, and they named a son Michael Hensley. Michael McDavid was the proven father of Catherine McDavid who married Samuel Hensley, Isom's suspected brother.\n\nIsom Hensley Jr was on the 1825 tax list in Scott Co., VA with 1 white male over 16 and no horses. His father Isom Sr was also listed as was his brother Benjamin. None of them were listed in 1824, so they must have moved there around that time (mid to late 1824 or very early 1825).\n\nIsom Hensley was not on the 1826 tax list for some reason, though his father was listed as Isom Sr. Isom Jr probably went back across the border for a few years. He was not listed on the Scott County tax lists in 1827, 1828, 1829 or 1830.\n\nIsom Hensley was listed on the 1830 census in Hawkins Co., TN. Several other Hensleys were in the county, but none were listed nearby. Michael McDavid (1760/70) was next door. Perhaps he is Jane's father. That would explain the name of their child \"Michael Hensley.\"\n\n1830 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1830 Hawkins Co., TN pg 61 Isham Hensley 1200010000000-1000010000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 30-39 (1790-1800) Isom Hensley (1797/98) 2 Male(s) 5-9 (1820-1825) Son?

(c1826)\n\nOn the 1832 Scott Co., VA Tax List, there is a listing for Isom Hensley and one for Isom F. Hensley. Presumably one of these is Isom Sr, the other Jr, but I don't know which is which. I would guess that the one with the \"F\" initial is the younger man, for middle names were very uncommon for people in Isom Sr's generation. Isom had 1 white male over 16 and either 2 or 3 horses, while Isom F. had 1 male over 16 and no horses.\n\nIsom Hensley was on the 1833 tax list with 1 white male over 16, and 2 horses. I believe this is Jr, but it could be Sr. Only one person of this name was listed.\n\nIsom Hensley was on the 1834 tax list with 1 white male over 16, and 1 horse.\n\nIsom Hensley was on the 1835 tax list with 1 white male over 16, and 1 horse.\n\nIsom Hensley was on the 1836 tax list with 1 white male over 16, and no horses.\n\nIsom Hensley was on the 1837 tax list with 2 white males over 16, and no horses. The second white male over 16 could be his oldest son (who is probably James-1821). Michael (c1823) wasn't quite 16 yet.\n\nIsom Hensley was on the 1838 tax list with 2 white males over 16, and no horses.\n\nIsom Hensley was on the 1839 tax list with 2 white males over 16, and no horses. By this time Michael (c1823) would be over 16, and this second male could be him. The 2nd male from 1837 and 1838 is probably the James Hensley who appears on the 1839 list for the first time in his own name. It is impossible to say for sure though. James was a neighbor of Isom's in 1850.\n\nIsom Hensley is listed on the 1840 census in Scott Co., VA. There are other Hensleys there too, but none listed nearby. Once again Michael McDavid (1760/70) was nearby, just two houses away. Mathias McDavid (1810/20) was next door, perhaps a brother-in-law. (They did name a child \"Mathias Hensley.\") Several of the other nearby surnames were the same as in 1830 in Hawkins Co., TN. Perhaps they didn't move at all, but the border was adjusted or uncertain.\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Scott Co, VA pg 298 Isom Hensley 2021010000000-1010010000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 30-39 (1800-1810) Isom Hensley (1797/98) 1 Male(s) 15-19 (1820-1825) Michael Hensley (1822/23) Son 2 Male(s) 10-14 (1825-1830) Isom Hensley (1827/28) Son William Hensley (1832/33) Son 2 Male(s) 0-4 (1835-1840) Samuel Hensley (1835/36) Son Mathias Hensley (1839/40) Son 1 Female(s) 30-39 (1800-1810) Jane McDavid Hensley (1799/1800) Wife 1 Female(s) 10-14 (1825-1830) Mary Hensley (c1826) Daughter 1 Female(s) 0-4 (1835-1840) Nancy Hensley (1837/38) Daughter\n\nIsom Hensley and family were listed on the 1850 census in Scott Co., VA. Several Hensleys were nearby, James (c1821) (probable son) was two houses away; Isom (c1828) probably son, was four houses away; Michael (c1823) probable son was five houses away. Leticia Hensley (c1810), relationship unknown, was seven houses away.\n\n1850 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\nScott Co., VA\n\nPHF 358B-115-115\n\nWestern District\n\nIsom Hensley\n\n52\n\nM\n\nFarmer\n\nTen\n\nJane\n\n50\n\nF\n\nTen\n\nWilliam\n\n17\n\nM\n\nDo\n\nVa\n\nSamuel\n\n14\n\nM\n\nVa\n\nNancy\n\n12\n\nF\n\nVa\n\nMatthias W.\n\n10\n\nM\n\nVa\n\nMargaret C.\n\n6\n\nF\n\nVa\n\nThey were listed on the 1860 census in Scott County.

Fowler\n\n20\n\nF\n\nW\n\nDomestic Servant\n\nTennessee\n\nFranky died sometime between 1870 and 27 Mar 1877 for on that date Samuel Hensley married Alice Fowler in Scott Co., VA. (She was living with them in 1870 as a domestic servant.) Alice was born ca 1848/49 in Washington Co., TN. The marriage record gave her mother's name as Nancy, but listed no father.\n\nNancy Fowler was a single mother and associated with the Hensleys over many years, so possibly related somehow. She (Nancy) was listed on the 1850 census in Washington Co., TN with Alcy Fowler (c1775 NC) and Betsy Fowler (c1800 TN) and young daughter Alcy Fowler (c1849) I would assume that Alcy (1775) was the mother of Betsy, who in turn was mother of Nancy. I could be wrong about that, but that is how it seems. This means that young Alice (or Alcy) was named after her great grandmother.\n\nIn 1860 Nancy Fowler was in Sullivan Co., TN residing in the household of Benjamin Hensley (1795) an uncle to Samuel Hensley. By this time she had three children in addition to Alcy / Alice (who was also there.)\n\nAs noted above, Alice was with Samuel Hensley in 1870 listed as a servant. Her mother Nancy was back in Washington Co., TN for that census. Alcy was listed at home with her too, so that raises the thought that perhaps the Alice Fowler with Samuel Hensley in 1870 was a different person, but perhaps not, it wasn't uncommon for a person to be listed twice on the census. There is no doubt which one married Samuel though, for the marriage record listed her as a daughter of Nancy Fowler.\n\nFor the 1880 census, Samuel Hensley and family were listed in Union Co., TN near his brother Isom. (Alice's mother Nancy Fowler was in Washington Co., TN in 1880.)\n\n1880 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\n(Note: The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census, but are approximate birth years based on age)\n\nUNION CO., TN Page 123B House/Family # 98/ 114 -- FIRST CIVIL DISTRICT Twp HENSLEY SAMUEL W M 45 M FARM LABOR VA VA VA 1834/1835 HENSLEY ALLACE E W F 29 WF M TN TN TN 1850/1851 HENSLEY JOHN K W M 10 S S NO OCCUPATION VA VA VA 1869/1870 HENSLEY DAVID W M 9 S S VA VA VA 1870/1871 HENSLEY NANCY E M J W F 8 D S TN TN TN 1871/1872 HENSLEY LOUISA W F 6 D S TN TN VA 1873/1874 HENSLEY GEORGE W W M 5 S S TN VA VA 1874/1875 HENSLEY SCOTT W M 0 S S 9/12 SEP TN VA VA 1879/1880\n\nThey were still in Union Co., TN for the 1900 and 1910 census.
