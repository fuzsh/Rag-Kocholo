        "text": "Stephen \"Steve\" L. Hensley, 69, passed away unexpectedly on Thursday, August 18, 2022, at his home in St. Charles.\n\nThe oldest son of Wilma and Albert Hensley, Steve was born on September 4, 1952, in St. Louis, Missouri. Steve was one of four siblings and grew up in Munster, Indiana.\n\nSteve met his future wife, Nancy Ladewski, while cheering on the Hoosiers at Indiana University. Steve and Nancy were married in 1974, and Steve graduated from Case Western Reserve Law School in 1976. They moved to the Chicago area after Steve graduated from law school. Steve began his life-long career as a Patent Attorney for Amoco/BP, while Nancy continued her teaching career. Steve and Nancy welcomed two children (Jessica and Grant) and moved to St. Charles in 1990.\n\nSteve was an avid gardener, fisherman, and chef. He cherished the times that he spent vacationing as a young boy in Northern Wisconsin. He shared his love of Northern Wisconsin, \"just one more cast,\" and Marty's Place North sundaes with his wife, children, and grandchildren during their annual visits to Plum Lake and Rest Lake. Steve also spent time gardening and was very proud of his several varieties of tomatoes, peppers, blueberries, and cherries. He loved taking the grandchildren for walks around the yard to pick fruits and veggies and explore. Steve enjoyed traveling, collecting wine, barbecuing, and smoking meat and fish on his collection of grills.\n\nSteve will be greatly missed by his wife, Nancy; children Jessica (Tim) Sendek and Grant (Olivia); and five grandchildren who he loved dearly and were lucky to call him Papa - Leo Sendek (9), Carter Sendek (7), Charlotte Hensley (6), Hadley Sendek (5), and Grace Hensley (3). Steve is also survived by his mother, Wilma Hensley, and three siblings - Edith Blush, David Hensley, and Amy Legutki. He is preceded in death by his father (Albert).\n\nA visitation will be held at Yurs Funeral Home in St. Charles on Wednesday, August 24, 2022, from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m., followed immediately by a memorial service at 3:30 p.m."
