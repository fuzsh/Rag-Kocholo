Dist. of Pendleton county, KY. in 1850. His land was valued at $435 then. His first 4 children were also present then, with Richardson only 1 yr. old in 1850 .\n\nHe was a farmer in the area of Dowingsville, Grant county, KY. as per the 1860 census of there. He had all 9 of his children present with he and his wife (Nancy J.) then. It could be a fare assumption that at least Samuel (4 months old at the taking of the 1860 census) was born in Grant county, KY. if not some of the other young children also.\n\nFound a James Hensley listed on the Civil War Pension Index as below:\n\nWidow: Wheeler, Jane (could be Nancy Jane re-married)\n\nService: F 68 E. Ky. Mil. Inf.\n\nDate of filing: 12 June 1893\n\nApplication #: J(?) 78,215\n\nState from which filed: KY.\n\nFound a James Hensley living in Lexington, Ky. in 1838 per Fische #6048872, page 118 of Ky. Obituaries. This could be John James (at 16 yrs. old??), his father (?), or an uncle (?).\n\nAlso obtained marriage info from Family Tree Maker's Marriage Index: KY. 1728-1850. Please note that there is also a Richerson Hensley mar. to Mary Simpson on above CD. Believe Mary was a sister to Nancy Jane Simpson. This CD also has a David Hensley married to a Leanner W. Draper. Believe these other two Hensley's are brothers. We have put them in our files as such and are working on verification of that assumption.\n\nNOTE: need to check for a Lewis P. Hensley (married to Susan Nave on April 6, 1818 in Fayette co., Ky. - county where Lexington is) in the records to see if he could be the parent of these Hensley's, including John James.\n\nNote: also found several Hensley marriages in Floyd and Franklin counties, all prior to John James' birth (Franklin co. is just a little NW of Lexington).\n\nFrom the record \"Pendleton co., Ky. Order Book H. Abstracts, 1830-1836\" on page 22, found the following under the names Mullins & Hensley: \"Guardianship: Stephen Mullins is appointed guardian adlitum to the infant heirs of Samuel Hensley, deceased, namely David Hensley, Richard Hensley, and John Hensley. Feb. 1831\". Again under Hensley: \"Guardianship: Mary Hensley is appointed guardian to David Hensley, Richardson Hensley, John Hensley, Zachariah Hensley, and to Polly Hensley -- infant orphans of Samuel Hensley, dec'd.\" This record connects them as sons of Samuel Hensley, but still doesn't tell us if this John Hensley is the same person as John James Hensley. The age factor does fit in. This same record on pg. 32 mentions \"Hensley. Inventory: Estate of Samuel Hensley. Sept. 1832. H: 112.\"\n\nThe same record mentions again on pg. 69: \"Appointment of Thomas Kidwell, Thomas Thrasher and Benjamin Hensley as patrollers in the Grassy Creek precinct. Jan 1838. I: 63.\" Wm. E. Rohr has copies of these last 3 mentioned items in his files.\n\nHave a note of a John Hensley moving to Covington, Ky. about Mar. 17, 1881. Need to check this out as to if it is our John James or his son, John J.\n\nAll data on his exact DOB & place, death date, and his ancestor's data came from Pedigree Resource File cd's. This includes most of the data on his siblings and half-siblings.\n\nWm. E. Rohr has searched the entire counties of Grant and Pendleton county in the 1880 census for John James and/or Nancy Jane Hensley, without finding either of them.\n\nFather: Samuel HENSLEY b: 29 SEP 1752 in Albermarle Co., VA.\n\nMother: Mary LEAK b: 24 JUN 1776\n\nMarriage 1 Nancy Jane SIMPSON b: BEF.

She also had a Thomas & Susan Carter, with their 2 kids, living with her on the farm. Thomas was working the farm for her. Susan was her daughter.\n\nFound her living with her daughter (Amanda F.

Amanda (Wooster) Lafferty was a 59 yr. old widow per this 1880 census. Her son, John T. Lafferty, the brother to Amanda F., was also living with the Simpson family and helping to work their farm.\n\nNote: found a J.A.

This Civil War Record could be for his son, Levi C. Wooster, but it seems to this researcher that this listing said something about Levi being \"old\".\n\nOriginally had his birth place as KY. Info as to it being VA. came from Amanda (Wooster) Lafferty on the 1880 census of Short Creek Dist. #6, Pendleton co., KY. His birth place also from the 1850 & 1860 census of Grant county, Ky. of him and his family.\n\nIn the 1840 census of Grant county, KY., Levi had 5 males (3 between ages 10-15yrs, 1 between 20-30 yrs., and 1 age 40-50 yrs.) and 5 females (1 under 5 yrs., 2 between 15-20 yrs., and 2 between 30-40 yrs. old) living in his household (this includes him).\n\nIn 1850 he (53 yrs. old, born in VA.) was farming in Grant co., Ky. with his wife (Elizabeth -50 yrs. old, born in VA.), and 3 children; George (20 yrs.), Sarah J. (13 yrs.), and Levi Clay (7 yrs.). This census shows everybody born in VA. Levi's farm was valued at $600.\n\nIn the 1860 census of Williamstown, Grant co., Ky., he was still farming there. His farm was valued at $200 and $225 of personal property. Leve C. was 17 yrs. old and the only child living with them at that time. This census shows Levi born VA., Elizabeth born OH. (hard to read though), and Levi C. born Ky.\n\nHis son, George, was living just a few houses away (page 954, or the page before Levi).\n\nHe (Levi Sr.) was not with his family in the 1870 census of Ky.
