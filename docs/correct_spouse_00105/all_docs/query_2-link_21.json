        "text": "Stephen Hensley was born sometime before ca 1785. I base this on his firs record being an 1801 tax list which lists him as aged 16 or older. That means he was born ca 1785 or earlier. I have found no other records to help narrow down his age better than that. He was probably born in Virginia, county unknown.\n\nI don't know who his parents are, but it seems likely he is closely related to the other Hensleys of Logan Co., WV, namely Daniel Hensley (c1774), William Hensley (c1774), James Hensley and Robert Hensley (c1777). They could all be brothers, but that isn't proven. They all may be children of the widow Catherine Hensley. Consider this article:\n\nAn article in an 1896 book states that Robert, William, Daniel and John are brothers and sons of a widowed Mrs. Hensley who married William Davis second:\n\nThe settlement at the mouth of Spruce, where Lewis Rutherford now lives, was made by Benjamin Sprouse. At just what time he settled there is not known, but he raised a large family of boys and girls, and with Reuben Thacker, a brother-in-law, moved further to the west, selling his place to William Davis, who came from Albermarle County, and claimed to be a first cousin of Thomas Jefferson. Davis married a Mrs. Hensley, of Russell County, who was the mother by her former marriage of four sons and one daughter. Three of the sons - William, Robert and John - and the daughter, whose name is forgotten. There was another son - Daniel - who had been captured by the Indians in 1790, and who remained with the Indians until 1807, when he joined the family and married a daughter of Thomas Davis, of Albermarle County, and niece of the William Davis above mentioned, settled at the mouth of Rockhouse Fork of Pigeon. Of the other Hensley boys, Robert married a daughter of Capt. Henry Farley, and settled at the mouth of Sugartree; William married a Miss Brewster, and settled opposite the mouth of Pond, on what is now known as the Lawson farm, and John married a Miss Davis and settled lower down the river. The daughter above mentioned married William Davis, a son of Thomas Davis of Albermarle, and nephew of the William Davis above mentioned, who settled near the mouth of Pigeon. William Davis, Sr., had one daughter by his first wife. William Davis, Sr., married a Miss Runyon, by whom he had two daughters, one of whom married Jess Stratredge and the other Jacob Runyon. (Ragland, Henry Clay, History of Logan County, W.Va. 1896)\n\nThe above article doesn't mention Stephen Hensley or James Hensley who were often associated with the others. Stephen and Robert married sisters, so that suggests a certain close relationship, though doesn't prove they are brotherse.\n\nStephen Hensley is listed on an 1801 tax list in Tazewell Co., VA. William Hensley and Robert Hensley (\"Hansley\") are listed also. Stephen is also listed on the 1803 tax list in Tazewell.\n\nRobert Hensley and Stephen Hensley both sued William Taylor in Tazewell Co., VA in Oct 1804 and Jun 1805. (Tazewell Co., Court Records shared by Laura Schreibman).\n\nSome of Stephen's probable siblings moved west before 1810 and were living in Floyd Co., KY per the 1810 census. Stephen wasn't listed on the 1810 census as far as I could find. He was probably with one of his brothers or his parents if they were still living then.\n\nOn 19 Apr 1814 Stephen Hensley married Nancy Farley in Cabell Co., VA (now WV), a daughter of Capt. Henry Farley:\n\nThe daughters of Captain Henry Farley were Judith, who married Thomas Thompson, and, who, after the death of Thompson, married Robert Hensley; Matilda, who married Carter T. Clark; and Mary, who first married Stephen Hensley, and afterwards married Pryyhus McGinnis. (Ragland, Henry Clay, History of Logan County, W.Va. 1896, pp. 52-53.)\n\nStephen Hensley died ca 1818 or 1819 in Cabell Co., VA (now WV).\n\nWidow Nancy is listed on the 1820 census in Cabell as were her probable brothers-in-law : William Hensley, Daniel Hensley (c1774) and Robert Hensley. Other Hensleys listed included Joseph Hensley, Solomon Hensley (c1779) and Samuel Hensley (c1790). The census was alphabetical, so it isn't clear if any of the Hensleys were neighbors to each other.\n\n1820 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1820 Cabell Co., VA page 85 Nancy Hensley 100000-20100 Slaves=0000-1100\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1 male 0-9 (1810/1820) Stephen M.

Nancy and family fell into the new county.\n\nNancy is listed on the 1830 census in Logan Co., VA (now WV).\n\n1830 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1830 Logan Co., VA page 275 Nancy Hensley 2100000000000-0111010000000 Slaves=000100-000000\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1 male 5-9 (1820/1825) Stephen M.

He was born ca 1790/91 per his age on the 1850 census, born somewhere in Virginia (same source). He had been married prior to his marriage to Nancy to Betsy Ladd Barner (married 3 Dec 1812 Cabell Co., VA).\n\nThey are on the 1840 census in Logan Co., VA.\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Logan Co., VA page 70 Pyrhus McGinnis 1221211000000-0011001000000 Slaves=000000-000000\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1 Male 40-49 (1790/1800) Pyrrhus McGinnis (c1791)\n\n1 male 30-39 (1800/1810) Son?\n\n2 males 20-29 (1810/1820) 1-Son?\n\n2-Stephen M.

Nancy is referred to as widow of late Stephen Hensley. (Mingo Co., WV Deed Book A page 139, shared by Laura Schreibman).\n\nOn the same date (5 Sep 1842), William Hatfield and wife Sally; James Williams and wife Paulina, and Stephen Hensley, heirs of Stephen Hensley, deceased, by Special Commissioner, sold land (the same mentioned above) to Elijah Hensley. (Mingo Co., WV Deed Book A, page 142, shared by Laura Schreibman).\n\nDuring the 1840's the family moved to neighboring Fayette County, and that section of Fayette became Raleigh County in 1850.\n\nThey are listed on the 1850 census in Raleigh Co., VA (now WV).\n\n1850 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\nRaleigh Co., VA\n\nPHF 5-60-60\n\nThe 57th District\n\nPyrus McGinniss\n\n59\n\nM\n\nFarmer\n\n1500\n\nVa\n\nNancy 57 F\n\n\"\n\nSamuel 20 M Laborer \" Gordan 17 M \" \" Thomas 14 M \" Catherine Massee 15 F \"\n\nThey are still in Raleigh for the 1860 census.

He was apparently home with his parents for the 1820 census aged under 10 (1810/20), and in 1830 age 5-9 (1820/25).
