        "text": "Alison Sweeney and David Sanov\n\nDays of Our Lives‘ Sami Brady could probably learn a few lessons in love from the Emmy winning actor who’s played her off and on since 1993. Because in real-life, she’s been married since July 8, 2000 to California State Trooper Sanov. The couple has two children, son Benjamin and daughter Megan.\n\nJohn McCook and Laurette Spang\n\nThe soap vet who’s played Bold & Beautiful‘s Eric since its first episode married his missus in 1980 (only a year after she played Cassiopeia on the original Battlestar Galactica). They have three children, including actress Molly McCook (Last Man Standing).\n\nWes Ramsey and Laura Wright\n\nCarly’s effervescent portrayer is madly in love with the man who played Port Charles’ now-deceased baddie Peter. The two first met when they both worked on Guiding Light playing Cassie and Sam, respectively, but it wasn’t until years later when they reconnected at the Daytime Emmys that a romance began. The couple currently lives together, and Wright has two children from her former marriage to John Wright.\n\nJason Thompson and Paloma Jonas\n\nGet ready, because Billy’s portrayer is about to gush about the beauty who became his bride in 2015 and has since gifted him with two children. “She’s just an amazing person and doesn’t have a selfish bone in her body,” the Young & Restless star told Soap Opera Digest.\n\nGalen Gering and Jenna Hudlett\n\nThe man who brings law and order to Days of Our Lives as Rafe has been married to Jenna Hudlett since 2000 — and there’s a good chance you may have caught the happy couple on E!’s short-lived reality series, Dirty Soap. They’ve got two sons, Dillon and Jensen.\n\nDon Diamont and Cindy Ambuehl\n\nBill’s portrayer tied the knot with his realtor sweetheart in France in 2012. (In fact, their dog Ezey is named after the town in which they said “I do.”) In a case of art imitating life, Ambuehl joined her husband on Bold & Beautiful as a conspicuously pretty real-estate agent.\n\nFinola Hughes and Russell Young\n\n1992 was a big year for the General Hospital actress who took a break from Anna after seven years and married British-American artist Russell Young. In the three decades since, the couple has had three children together and Anna’s jumped to All My Children, General Hospital: Night Shift and back, gaining (and losing) a twin sister along the way!\n\nMelody Thomas Scott and Edward J. Scott\n\nWhile mixing business and pleasure rarely works out for the residents of Genoa City, the same definitely can’t be said for Nikki’s portrayer and her hubby. Although now supervising producer at Bold & Beautiful, he was serving as executive producer at Young & Restless when first they met.\n\nEric Martsolf and Lisa Kouchak\n\nDays of Our Lives leading man Martsolf (Brady) and Lisa Kouchak have been married since 2003 and have twin sons who are — believe it or not — 17 years old!\n\nHeather Tom and James Achor\n\nSince the soap-hopping Emmy winner wed her beau in 2011, they’ve added to their family one son, Zane, who for a while was both her real- and reel-life son after he was brought on Bold & Beautiful to play Katie and Bill’s son, Will!\n\nJames and Kassie DePaiva\n\nDays of Our Lives’ former Eve and General Hospital’s onetime Dr. Bensch met on One Life to Live, where they played lovers Blair Cramer and Max Holden. They have been married since 1996. The couple share a son (also James) and Mrs. D is stepmother to Dreama, her husband’s daughter with his ex-wife, Hee Haw performer Misty Rowe.\n\nScott DeFreitas and Maura West\n\nThe General Hospital MVP met husband Scott DeFreitas on the As the World Turns set. Before she scored an Emmy as Ava, the actress played Carly to DeFreitas’ Andy in Oakdale. They were married in 2000. West is a dedicated mother to five.\n\nMishael Morgan and Navid Ali\n\nDuring her run on Young & Restless, Morgan played both the ill-fated Hilary Curtis Hamilton and the twin sister who never got to know her, Amanda Sinclair. In real life, the beauty has been married to her guy since since 2012. They have two children together.\n\nShawn Christian and Arianne Zucker\n\nDays of Our Lives’ late Daniel only had a brief fling with Nicole before his death, but in real life, their portrayers have been dating for several years now and live together. They became engaged in 2021, and have bringing fans along for the ride and sharing their wedding-planning adventures on their social media accounts. Zucker was previously married to Days of Our Lives co-star Kyle Lowder (ex-Rex) from 2002-14, and they share a daughter, while Christian has a son from his previous marriage to Deborah Quinn.\n\nKatherine Kelly Lang and Dominique Zoida\n\nBrooke’s Bold & Beautiful portrayer and her handsome partner love traveling together, and they’re both so athletic that there’s a 50/50 chance you’re getting fitter just by reading this caption.\n\nCameron and Vanessa Mathison\n\nMarried since 2002, Drew’s General Hospital portrayer and his lovely wife have two children, a son and a daughter. When the couple met, the future Mrs. Mathison was anything but starstruck, the All My Children alum Instagrammed in 2022. “She had no idea who I was… She only watched General Hospital” — keeping an especially close eye on Jack Wagner (ex-Frisco)!\n\nCamryn Grimes and Brock Powell\n\nMariah’s portrayer — who also played Young & Restless’ ill-fated Cassie — and her voice-actor beau marked their first anniversary back in March of 2021. In January 2022, he popped the question and she said, “Yes!” The happy duo showed off the ring when they attended the Daytime Emmys together.\n\nBill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes\n\nThese Days of Our Lives legends are a couple both on and off screen. Doug and Julie have been married since 1976, but the actors can top that: In real life, they tied the knot in 1974. Yet they are not soaps’ longest-married real-life couple. (To find out who is, click here.)\n\nDarin Brooks and Kelly Kruger Brooks\n\nThe soap-star couple, who met working on his old series Blue Mountain State, tied the knot in 2016. And though they’ve both appeared on Bold & Beautiful as Wyatt and Eva (a Forrester publicist), she is better known as Young & Restless‘ Mackenzie. They’ve got two daughters.\n\nLynn Herring and Wayne Northrop\n\nLucy may struggle to make relationships work, but her General Hospital portrayer has no such problem! Herring and Northrop (who played Rex on Port Charles and both Roman and Alex on Days of our Lives) met in an acting class in 1980. Herring, legend has it, knew within a week that he was The One. They married in 1981 in an outdoor wedding and own a working cattle ranch with their two children.\n\nMichael Graziadei and Lauren Carey\n\nThe entire world got to watch as Daniel’s Young & Restless portrayer surprised his longtime love by popping the question on The Talk in March 2023. The pair has two twin boys, Oliver and Arlo, together.\n\nLucas Adams and Shelby Wulfert\n\nBefore he was cast on Days of Our Lives in 2017, the actor who plays the hunky Tripp met his future wife and fellow actor while while working on the Disney Channel’s Liv and Maddie. Seven years later, the two married in 2022.\n\nThorsten Kaye and Susan Haskell\n\nIn a beautiful case of life imitating art, in real-life, Bold & Beautiful‘s Ridge is married to Haskell, best known for her role of Marty Saybrooke (opposite his Patrick Thornhart) on One Life to Live. Except at home, where she’s probably better known as Mom to their two daughters.\n\nMaurice Benard and Paula Smith\n\nGeneral Hospital mobster Sonny is quite the ladies’ man, but Benard has been a one-woman guy since he married his wife in 1990. They have three children together and adopted Smith’s sister when she was 15 after their mother passed away.\n\nA.J. Gilbert and Martha Madison\n\nAs you can see, wherever these two go, a fun time is all but guaranteed to follow. Days of Our Lives’ Belle Black said “I do” to her restaurateur beau back in 2007. Half a dozen years, baby food was added to the menu when daughter Charley made her debut.\n\nLauralee Bell and Scott Martin\n\n“Honestly, I couldn’t do what I do without his support,” Cricket’s longtime Young & Restless portrayer told us of the spouse to whom she’s been wed since 1997. The pair have two children who, as she puts it, “are probably old enough that they don’t need me hovering over them. But they still let me, anyways.”\n\nElizabeth Cameron and Bryan Dattilo\n\nDays of Our Lives‘ Lucas has royally screwed things up with Sami, but the actor who plays him has been happily married to Elizabeth Cameron since 2011. In 2014, the couple welcomed their daughter. Dattilo was previously married to Jessica Denay, and they have a son, who has high-functioning autism and is involved with autism charities and awareness-raising efforts.\n\nDenise Richards and Aaron Phypers\n\nShauna’s off-screen alter ego married her hunky hubby in 2018 before she joined The Bold and the Beautiful. The Wild Things vixen was formerly married to actor Charlie Sheen, with whom she has two daughters. In 2011, she adopted a third daughter.\n\nRebecca Staab and William deVry\n\nThis daytime power couple has been together for years and, while they’ve never appeared on a soap together, they do share a Port Charles connection. While deVry, of course, played General Hospital bad boy Julian, Staab is known for playing Port Charles’ Elizabeth. After Julian was killed off, the couple relocated to his home country of Canada.\n\nEileen Davidson and Vincent Van Patten\n\nFans got an up-close and personal look into the homelife of Ashley’s on-again, off-again portrayer and her spouse when she appeared on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Married since 2003, they share one son.\n\nDrake Hogestyn and Victoria Post\n\nAs enduring as John’s love for Marlena has been, it doesn’t hold a candle to the actor who plays him. Hogestyn married his childhood sweetheart in 1986, the same year that he joined Days of Our Lives, and the pair has four children together. In fact, son Ben has followed in his father’s footsteps and has appeared on both Bold & Beautiful and General Hospital.\n\nRena Sofer and Sanford Bookstaver\n\nNot even Bold & Beautiful could top this romantic storyline. Quinn’s former portrayer married the TV producer in 2003, they divorced in 2017, and — plot twist! — the parents of two daughters have since reconciled.\n\nDominic Zamprogna and Linda Leslie\n\nThis Canadian native married his wife in November of 2009 — just five months after joining General Hospital to play Sonny’s undercover son Dante! The following year, they welcomed the first of three daughters to the world.\n\nChristel Khalil and Sam Restagno\n\nThe actress who plays Young & Restless’s Lily became engaged to her man in April 2022, has a son with her first husband, Stephen Hensley and just this past June announced she’s expecting her first child with Restagno.\n\nMatthew Ashford and Lana Buss\n\nDays of Our Lives‘ Jack is all in on Jennifer, but in real life, his portrayer has been married to Lana Buss since November 2016. They have two children together, plus Ashford’s two daughters from his previous marriage to Christina Saffran.\n\nJennifer Gareis and Bobby Ghassemieh\n\nOff screen, Bold & Beautiful‘s Donna has been happily hitched to this real-estate developer since 2010. The couple has two children, a son and a daughter, and no trouble looking amazing in every picture. Seriously. Every. Single. One.\n\nDon Money and Emme Rylan\n\nWhile the actress has been on a bit of a General Hospital break with poor Lulu comatose, her long-term relationship with Money has been going strong since 2007. The couple has three children together — two sons and a daughter.\n\nMelissa Ordway and Justin Gaston\n\nThe couple that acts together, stays together… at least that’s been the case for Abby’s portrayer and her handsome hubby, who tied the knot back in 2012. The couple — who have two daughters — got to tie the knot all over again when in late 2020, he temporarily stepped into the role of Young & Restless’ Chance just in time for their alter egos to become man and wife!\n\nBradford Tatum and Stacy Haiduk\n\nThe soap vet who’s been scheming as Days of Our Lives‘ Kristen since 2018, will soon celebrate 35 years of marriage to her hubby. The couple met on the first season of SeaQuest DSV, where she played series regular Katherine and he guest-starred. They have one daughter, Sophia, also an actress, who appeared on Days of Our Lives as Xander’s masseuse!\n\nAaron D. Spears and Estella Lopez\n\nThe actor who has given Bold & Beautiful‘s Justin his edge has five children with his wife — four daughters and a son. Or, in soap terms, almost enough characters to populate a daytime drama of his own.\n\nMichael Patrick Jann and Lisa LoCicero\n\nThe actress who’s play General Hospital‘s Olivia married her honey back in 2000, and they had son Lukas the following year. 14 years later, in 2015, daughter Verity rounded out the family. Jann is an actor, writer and director best known for appearing on MTV’s sketch comedy The State.\n\nJordi and Kaitlin Vilasuso\n\nAsk the soap vet who most recently played Young & Restless‘ Rey the secret to a good marriage and he’ll tell you it’s communication. “Kaitlin and I have learned how to work through issues,” he admitted to Soaps.com. Married since 2012, the couple has two daughters. “I’ve learned never to take anything that comes into your life for granted,” he said.\n\nCarson Boatman and Julana Dizon\n\nAs Johnny DiMera’s Days of Our Lives portrayer reached his first wedding anniversary with his beautiful bride in July 2022, it was clear that the honeymoon was anything but over. “You are my rock, my heart and really my everything,” he told her via Instagram.\n\nSean and Michele Kanan\n\nThe actor who plays Bold & Beautiful’s often-devious Deacon and his beautiful wife have been married since 2012 and have a blended family of five. Together, they produce the award-winning Amazon Prime series Studio City, which Kanan also stars in.\n\nKathleen Gati and Michael Browers\n\nFrom Faison to Victor, Dr. Liesl Obrecht doesn’t exactly make healthy choices when it comes to the men in her life. Fortunately, the General Hospital actress who plays her struck gold with her real-life husband, and the two have been married since 2012.\n\nSusan Walters and Linden Ashby\n\nYoung & Restless‘ Diane is married to the Genoa City alum who just wrapped a return as big bad Cameron. The pair tied the knot in 1986 and have two children, Grace and Savannah.\n\nJudi Evans and Michael Luciano\n\nWhether playing the much-missed Adrienne or the unforgettable Bonnie, this Days of Our Lives leading lady has been married to her hubby since 1993, having tied the knot back when she was Another World‘s Paulina. They had a son, Austin Michael, who tragically died in late 2019 at age 23.\n\nKarla Mosley and John Rogers\n\nThe daytime vet who played Bold & Beautiful‘s Maya is in a long-term relationship with the handsome fella with whom she has two daughters.\n\nBilly Flynn and Gina Comparetto\n\nHappier in love than his Days of Our Lives widower, the actor who plays Chad has been married to his wife since October 1, 2016. Comparetto is an actress and producer and even appeared as Lisa in one episode of Days of Our Lives in 2016.\n\nLauren and Josh Swickard\n\nMarried on December 29, 2019, nearly two years after he joined General Hospital as Chase, this acting couple has starred in Netflix’s Roped and A California Christmas. In 2021, the couple welcomed their firstborn, daughter Savannah, and is 2023, Lauren gave birth to their son, Arthur.\n\nDoug Davidson and Cindy Fisher\n\nDavidson may no longer be onscreen as Paul, but he did walk away with one heck of a parting gift: It was on the set of Young & Restless that he met his wife when she was playing Rebecca. Married in 1984, they have two children.\n\nGrant Turnbull and Nadia Bjorlin\n\nThe Days of Our Lives beauty who plays Chloe met property developer, home builder and her future husband back in 2013, after ending a seven-year relationship with fellow Salemite Brandon Beemer (Shawn). The couple married in May 2015 and have two sons together.\n\nMatthew Atkinson and Brytnee Ratledge\n\nThe Bold & Beautiful star is much luckier in love than Thomas, though Hope may eventually change that streak. The actor popped the question to his love in a romantic proposal that took place early in June 2023.\n\nGenie Francis and Jonathan Frakes\n\nThe Emmy winning General Hospital legend who’s given us Laura for over four decades has been married to Star Trek: The Next Generation icon Jonathan Frakes since 1988. The couple originally met on the primetime soap opera Bare Essence and later reunited for the epic miniseries North and South. They share a son and daughter.\n\nPeter Bergman and Mariellen Bergman\n\nThe handsome guy who plays Smilin’ Jack on Young and Restless married his second wife in 1985. At the time, he was playing All My Children good guy Cliff Warner. They have two children together.\n\nMarlon Aquino and Camila Banus\n\nMarried in 2021, Aquino proposed to the actress who will soon be stepping down as Days of Our Lives’ Gabi over the Christmas break of 2020. “He got down on one knee,” she said in announcing the happy news. “There were tears in his eyes, and he did it.” Needless to say, her response was a jubilant yes!\n\nRory Gibson and Alicia Ruelas\n\nEver since Noah and Allie jetted off to London, we’ve been left to wonder how the Young & Restless pair is fairing.But the man who plays the Newman heir has been in a relationship with model Ruelas for over a decade. They got engaged in October 2022!\n\nJames Reynolds and Lissa Layng\n\nThe Emmy-winning actor who’s played Days of Our Lives‘ Abe for over four decades has been married to his lovely wife for nearly as long. The two have been together since 1985, while Reynolds has a son with his previous wife, Laura Toffenetti.\n\nAdrienne Frantz and Scott Bailey\n\nThe actress, whose Bold & Beautiful character Amber successfully crossed over to Young & Restless (and back again!) married actor Scott Bailey (Guiding Light‘s Sandy) in 2011. The sweethearts have three children together: Amelie, Killian, and Lion.\n\nMary Beth Evans and Michael Schwartz\n\nMarried in 1985 — one year before the actress joined Days of Our Lives as Kayla — this couple has three grown children: Matthew, Katherine and Daniel. And recently, they’ve begun to welcome grandchildren into their family!\n\nDaniela Lopez and Bryan Craig\n\nThe model who stole the heart of the Emmy winner who played Morgan doesn’t just love him. As she Instagrammed on her honey’s 30th birthday in 2021, she loves him “till the wheels come off, baby!”\n\nPaul Telfer and Carmen Cusack\n\nDays of Our Lives‘ lovable rogue Xander owes a lot of charm to the man who plays him and who, in real life, is married to the beloved Broadway actress known for playing Elphaba in the Chicago, North American Tour and Melbourne productions of the musical Wicked, as well as originating the role of Alice Murphy in the Broadway musical Bright Star.\n\nMichael and Janeen Damian\n\nYoung & Restless’ favorite rock star, the actor who’s played Danny off and on for decades has been married to his lovely wife Janeen since 1998. Even better? They love to make movies together, including the much-loved High Strung franchise.\n\nLindsay Arnold and John Harlan Kim\n\nThankfully, the actress who until recently played Days of Our Lives’ Allie gets to leave the never-ending relationship drama at the studio. After hours, her honey is the Aussie actor who you surely recognize, given that he’s appeared on everything from the Down Under soap Neighbours to NCIS: Los Angeles. He’s also recurred on Hawaii Five-0 and 9-1-1.\n\nJacqueline MacInnes Wood and Elan Ruspoli\n\nThe Daytime Emmy winner who brings Bold & Beautiful‘s Steffy to life married her hubba-hubba honey in 2018. They now have three sons, Rise, Lenix, and Brando, and are expecting their fourth child even as we type these words!\n\nMichael Easton and Ginevra Arabia\n\nAs the soap vet has gone from playing General Hospital‘s John to Silas to Finn, a welcome constant in his life has been his beautiful missus. The actor and model wed in 2004 and have two children, Lilah and Jack.\n\nAllison Lanier and JD Samson\n\nAccording to her Instagram, Young & Restless’ Summer shares a “birthday and a life” with the non-binary singer/songwriter of electronic rock group, Le Tigre.\n\nRyan Matteson and Marci Miller\n\nIt’s not many folks who would move across the country to support their partner’s acting dreams, but when Days of Our Lives‘ then-future, now-former Abigail wanted to attend acting school, that’s exactly what the newlyweds did. In March of 2021, they announced that they had had a daughter, who was delivered during a blizzard in Denver.\n\nCassandra Creech and Johnny Bowden\n\nThe actress who plays Grace, mom to both Paris and Zoe, on Bold & Beautiful married author/nutritionist Johnny Bowden in 1998. Believe it or not, he’s penned over 14 books, including the bestseller The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth.\n\nAdam Fergus and Hayley Erin\n\nGeneral Hospital‘s Kiki may be resting in peace — damn you, Ryan Chamberlain! — but the Emmy winner who played her is living large. In 2020, the veteran of The Young and the Restless (as Abby) married Irish actor Fergus, who you may recognize from Being Erica, Scandal or Supernatural. A year later, the couple added to their family photos twin girls, “Bubbles” and “Fuzzball.” (See them here.)\n\nMelissa Claire Egan and Matt Katrosar\n\nWhile this happy couple — who wed back in 2014 — have had the chance to work together on Young & Restless, Katrosar is not actually an actor. He did, however, put in two appearances on the soap on which she plays Chelsea in 2020, playing first her kidnapper and later an EMT! They welcomed their first child, Caden, into the world in August 2021, followed by son Jake in July of 2023.\n\nCasey Moss and True O’Brien\n\nDating since they met on the set of Days of Our Lives playing doomed sweethearts J.J. and Paige, this happy couple has been going strong since 2015. And in 2022, they shared the news on Instagram that they’d gotten engaged!\n\nLydia Look and Jen Kuo Sung\n\nThe unforgettable actress who plays General Hospital‘s Selina, one of the heads of the original five families of Port Charles (now down to two), has been married to her husband since 2005. He’s an actor and video game voice-over artist and has been a student of kung fu since he became enamored with Bruce Lee’s films as a teen.\n\nRobert Newman and Britt Helfer\n\nAs Newman has gone from Guiding Light‘s good guy Josh to Young & Restless’ now-deceased villain Ashland, one constant in the actor’s life has been his marriage to his wife, who played Lily on Loving, since 1986. The pair has two kids together — Kendall and Connor.\n\nFreddie Smith and Alyssa Tabit\n\nTogether since 2011, this happy couple became engaged in July of 2018 and got hitched in December of 2020. After departing Days of Our Lives, Sonny’s former portrayer relocated to Florida with his missus. The couple hosts a podcast together and are involved in the real estate industry.\n\nCady McClain and Jon Lindstrom\n\nThe General Hospital leading man (or villain, depending on if he’s playing Kevin or Ryan) met and fell in love with his wife (most recently stepping in as Days of Our Lives‘ Jennifer) during their daily commute to work on As the World Turns, where they played Craig and Rosanna. The couple has been married since 2014.\n\nShemar Moore and Jesiree Dizon\n\nYoung & Restless’ onetime Malcolm hid his lady love from the world until it was time for them to share the news that they were expecting their first child together. In January 2023, he revealed that Dizon was his significant other and that she was pregnant with a girl! Soon after, news broke that their daughter had been born.\n\nRobert Scott Wilson and Terann Hillow\n\nWho needs birthday cake when they get messages like this?
