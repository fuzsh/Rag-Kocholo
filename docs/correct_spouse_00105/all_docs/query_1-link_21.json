Probably a daughter of Nathan.\n\n∙ Sally Hensley (c1760/70) listed on 1830 census. She is a Hanby and not Hensley.

No direct proof that Ann was a Hensley, but they did name a son \"William Hensley Grizzle\" and did purchase land from William Hensley (1765/84) in 1810. Last found on 1830 census Scott Co. VA. Thanks to Bill Mooneyham for data on this family.\n\n∙ Barbara Hensley (c1813) was living with Zachariah Hensley (1794) in 1850. She was listed last in the household, after younger children. Was she a younger sister of Zachariahs? Was she a daughter from a pervious marriage? (He married in 1818). Was she a niece? The 1850 census entry is all I have on her.\n\n∙Benjamin Hensley (c1795) and Mary Ann McDavid of TN (Sullivan, Greene) and VA (Scott)\n\n∙ Celia Hensley (c1794 VA) married David Minnick. Married in 1812, lived in Scott Co., VA and Monroe and Owen Co., IN. I have seen no evidence she was a Hensley but others list her as such. They testified on behalf of Jesse Hensley's War of 1812 Pension Application. Others list Celia as daughter of Fielding Hensley which is incorrect. What proof that she is a Hensley?\n\n∙Fielding Hensley (c1761) and Nancy Cornett of VA (Buckingham, Washington, Scott)\n\n∙Hannah Hensley (1807) married David Little and William Dixon of VA (Washington, Scott) and IN (Washington, Monroe)\n\n∙ Hannah R.

Hannah is a proven Hensley, but parents are unknown, relationship to Agnes is unknown. I think Hannah is most likely a daughter of John Hensley (1798) but can't prove it. Hannah was listed on the 1860 and 1870 census in Scott Co., VA, in 1870 next door to Mary, widow of John Hensley (1798). In 1880 she was in Fayette Co., IL.\n\n∙Ichabod Hensley - An overview and study of the four men of this name from Virginia.\n\n∙Ichabod Hensley (1780/82) and Catherine Livingston of VA, TN and AL\n\n∙Ichabod C.

Hensley (c1854) here on the 1880 census with wife Susan and her parents George Coleman Morris and Laky M. (---). No sign of Andrew in 1860 or 1870. The Morris family was in Patrick Co., VA in 1860 and 1870. In 1860 they were 9 houses from John Hensley son of Judith (see Patrick County above). This may be coincidental. No sign of Andrew or Susan on the 1900 census.\n\n∙ Ann Hensley (1770/80-aft 1830) and Jesse Grizzle. No direct proof that Ann was a Hensley, but they did name a son \"William Hensley Grizzle\" (ca 1812) and did purchase land from William Hensley (1765/84) in 1803 and 1810. Last found on 1830 census Scott Co., VA.

There is a Joseph Castle on 1820 Scott Co., VA census aged 45+ (born bef 1775), and wife 26-44 (1775/94). Her age doesn't work well for someone married 1786, unless the wife is a second wife and not Geminey Hensley. There is a Jamima Castle listed in Scott in 1820 too, but she is also too young to be Geminey Hensley.\n\n∙Henry Hensley (c1794-1836) of VA (Washington) and IN (Monroe)\n\n∙ Henry Hensley (c1850 TN) here in 1880 wife Louizar (c1852 TN) son Theophilus (c1870 VA).
