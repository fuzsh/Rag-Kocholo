For the surname Example you type in\n\nhttps://sortedbyname.com/letter_e/example.html\n\nYou must change the directory /letter_e if the surname you seek starts with a different letter. You figured that out, right? Use lower case, no spaces, hyphens, apostrophes or other stuff.\n\nRemember, names are sorted the correct way: by surnames, then given names, not by word. La Forest is sorted as Laforest and Rose Mary is sorted as Rosemary. This also means Josephine is between Joseph I and Joseph J.\n\nPregnant? Need help?
