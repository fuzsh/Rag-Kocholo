        "text": "Wedding bells are ringing for THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS star Christel Khalil (Lily)! The actress and her longtime beau, Sam Restagno, are engaged to be married!\n\nThe couple actually got engaged a while ago, but Khalil just announced the wonderful news on April 10 in a sweet Instagram post. The Y&R star shared a trio of photos of her and her partner smiling and kissing while enjoying a cruise on a boat. ‚ÄúA couple months ago, I said yes to the love of my life,‚Äù Khalil captioned her post. ‚ÄúWe hate taking pictures, so thank you to our beautiful friends for finally making us!‚Äù\n\nKhalil credited her friend, entrepreneur and Indigo Yoga Lab founder Peter Nguyen, ‚Äúfor being such an amazing photog.‚Äù Upon further inspection, the sweet photos of Khalil and Restagno weren‚Äôt from their actual engagement, but rather from a birthday celebration sailing around Marina Del Rey, California, in honor of actress Adriana Leonard. At the urging of their pals on board the private party cruise, Khalil and her fianc√© posed for the romantic shots. ‚ÄúAnd thank you, Sam, for asking me to be your partner in life,‚Äù continued Khalil.\n\nPreviously, Khalil was married to Stephen Hensley, with whom she shares her 11-year-old son, Michael. The Hensleys split after just a few years, and Khalil has been dating Restagno since at least 2016, which is when she made her relationship with the Canadian businessman Instagram official. In her post, Khalil made it clear that she was thrilled to be getting married again ‚Äî after all, she and Restagno seem to have a lot in common, if their outfits in the photos are any indication! ‚ÄúI could not be happier to tether myself to you forever,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúAnd yes, dressing the same that day was a true accident üòÜ.‚Äù\n\nThe actress‚Äô Y&R co-stars showered her with lots of well-wishes. ‚ÄúI love this!‚Äù wrote Michelle Stafford (Phyllis), punctuating her comment with multiple exclamation points and heart emojis. ‚ÄúSo happy for you!‚Äù added Courtney Hope (Sally), while Melissa Ordway (Abby) commented, ‚ÄúYay! Congratulations.‚Äù Lauralee Bell (Christine) said that she was ‚Äúthrilled for you guys,‚Äù and Christian Jules LeBlanc (Michael) shared that the news was ‚ÄúSo wonderful.‚Äù\n\nPlease join us in congratulating the happy couple!"
