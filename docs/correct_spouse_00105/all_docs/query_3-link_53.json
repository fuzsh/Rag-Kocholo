        "text": "Last week Hire Heroes USA had the pleasure of getting together as a company for our annual conference. I was reminded of my first conference with the company back in 2019, one I attended with excitement but nervousness for the unexpected. Now, almost 5 years later, I attended with excitement and #confidence. Confidence because of a company and mentors that advocate for #militaryspouses and hold space for military spouses to grow their careers and passions. This year I was honored to receive Manager of the Year for my department, and moderate a session on Change Management with Don Sather, SPHR. Accomplishments only made possible because of a company, bosses, and mentors who support military spouses in our lifestyle AND to pursue our careers at the same time. Leading our new hire training my motto has become, ‚ÄúWe all apply to support the mission, but we stay for the culture,‚Äù and I am doubling down on that statement in 2024. Thank you for the collaboration and mentorship along the way. Elena C. Johnathan S. Carmen White Kelly Grivner-Kelly, MBA, CPRW Chelsea Paguio, CVA Kristen Ross Kelsey Wolf-Wallace M.A., LCMHCA Kayla Corbisiero, CPRW Kara Sparkman Michele Wiesner\n\nIn honor of Veteran's Day, I'd love for you to consider donating to the organization I work for, Hire Heroes USA. We empower transitioning service members, veterans, and military spouses through their job search and into meaningful employment. This is personal to me not only because I love my job, but because my husband is active duty Army. One day he WILL transition and he WILL need our help. Our service members deserve assistance to find a successful next chapter and not have to go it alone. Our military spouses deserve to find worth in their own careers as we serve in the silent ranks. This Veteran's Day, donate to Hire Heroes USA in support of service members, veterans, and military spouses receiving professionally written resumes, virtual career events, mock interviews, industry mentorship, networking guidance, and more. Thanks to Tito's Handmade Vodka, each gift will be matched up to $30,000 until November 17th! https://lnkd.in/gHwzuiHD\n\nTransitioning service members, veterans, and military spouses, join me tomorrow to learn more about the benefits of a skills-focused job search. This could be a game changer for gaining traction in your search, so I hope to see you there! Let's finish this last quarter of the year with a fresh focus on how to find your next role. #jobsearch #skillsfocused #walmart #militaryspouse #veteran #findemployment\n\nThis week I had the pleasure of attending the Military Civilian Transition Summit hosted by the Department of Labor to discuss all things TAP and veteran/spouse employment. This was a full circle week for me, as my passion for supporting our transitioning service members started with my time in the Fort Lee SFL TAP office as the Army Career Skills Program Administrator. Thanks for all you taught me NaStelle Graves and D Boyce. The experts who spoke this week demonstrated an intense and ever-continuing passion to make the TAP process the best it can be. The collaboration between the DOL, VA, DoD, and VSOs was inspiring. While we all have different roles in this space, we all show up for the same reason, for service members to have a successful transition, and for veterans and spouses to find meaningful work. This shared passion is what moves the needle forward year after year. Thank you to all those who planned and contributed to the event and meaningful briefs. It was a pleasure connecting with you Tommy Jones Sean Bresett Kate Moon John Randolph Nathan Ainspan #dol #veterantransition #tap #veteranemployment #militaryspouse"
