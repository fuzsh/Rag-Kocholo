        "text": "Sometimes! It started before we got together on the SoD books, in fact. When Greebo is shut in a box and everyone discovers there are THREE states for a cat in box: alive, dead, and absolutely bloody furious --- Jack and I had been talking to Terry about Schrodinger's cat and quantum theory. He'd clearly run with the idea and found his own variation. Every so often we'd see something in one of the DW books and think \"ah! I know where that came from!\" Terry has often said (and recently written) that writers steal (oops, sorry, pay homage) ideas from everyone they know. We stole some of his and he paid homage to a few of ours.\n\nUntil you asked I'd never thought about it. Now I'm wondering if there's a book in it... 'Catastrophe theory' is a set of mathematical ideas about how things can undergo sudden changes. Not necessarily disasters, but those too. A rainbow is a catastrophe in the mathematical sense, but not a disaster (though it might be an omen..) The idea (it caught public attention, then got rubbished by mainly ignorant critics, and ended up winning but under a new name, singularity theory, so the critics still think it lost) was that there are natural 'shapes' for sudden changes. You can use these shapes to understand what's going on. I've used this kind of math to get some insights into how new species form in evolution, and how a horse changes gait from walk to trot and so on. The relevance to Terry is that every so often he phoned up his friends with strange but wonderful questions - on science, on folklore, whatever. He'd choose an 'expert' in the area and bug them. It helped a lot if you knew various esoteric things and could bring them to bear on the question. So I got all the math questions, and some physics/astronomy whatever. Jack got the biology ones (such as 'what do you know that's interesting about rats?' for The Amazing Maurice). Catastropeh theory is a part of nonlinear dynamics, and that sometimes helped me give vaguely sensible answers.\n\nIt certainly gets frustrating for MY brain. The universe is constantly generating things that prove it's much cleverer than I am. Intelligent though we humans may be, compared to much else on this planet, it can take us an awful lot of thought to see the obvious. The good thing about reductionism is that you eventually get down to a problem small enough to solve. The bad thing is, it's not the problem you started with.\n\nJack Cohen introduced me to Terry in 1990 at the Novacon SF convention at a Birmingham airport hotel. Terry had come along unexpectedly, just as a fan. Jack knew him from before Terry was famous, so he introduced us and we all went off to lunch, and then the bar. Then Jack and I started writing books together - the first was The Collapse of Chaos, and Terry gave us some advice about that. When we followed it up with Figments, he gave us more advice, and contributed a cover quote. It was only some after that that we decided all three of us should do some sort of popular science book based on Discworld. Then it took about 6 months to find a format that would work - there being no science as such in Discworld.\n\nThat dinosaurs don't fly - well, not horizontally...\n\nNo, actually, what all three of us learned was 'what science is'. When we did SoD2 we decided to have a pair of chapters in the middle where the wizards found out what science was. Believing this to be routine, we left those until the rest of the book had been written. Then Terry asked: \"well, what is science then?\" and we realised it wasn't going to be at all routine. Eventually Jack and I got round to the idea that science is about proving yourself wrong - or better yet, proving some other scientist wrong. I said I always told my PhD students that I knew they'd got their thesis on the right track when they discovered something I'd told them, or better still published, was wrong. Then I mentioned my current research on animal locomotion - trotting horse, off the ground sometimes? (Yes). And some old experiments with insects walking on a rotating cylinder covered in soot, to leave tracks.\n\nWell, Terry decided this was the way to go. So we had an Ephebian philosopher who had argued on 'pure thought' grounds that a trotting horse never left the ground entirely, and a student who desperately wanted to prove the great man right. So he (deep breath) DID AN EXPERIMENT which was like the insect one but using a horse. Running on a beach. Suspended form a frame on rollers. The beach rolling past underneath on a conveyor belt... And, of dear, it turned out the Great Man was wrong. So the student walked into the sea and drowned himself.\n\nAt which point we could say: THAT'S NOT SCIENCE!!! A true scientist would give their right arm to prove their PhD supervisor wrong!\n\nWe also realised that if we'd thought of this scenario earlier, the whole book would have been different.\n\n2. Yes, DW made us think in a new way. \"What would the wizards think about this?\" became a great way to spot places where we were just spouting the conventional wisdom. It made me somewhat sceptical about dark matter, for example. The wizards immediately spotted this was some sort of magical incantation, not science.\n\nSam told me to start at 1.00, so here we go...\n\n1. I remember turning up at Terry's house in my new red Toyota Celica. My wife made lots of 'midlife crisis' jokes when I bought it for my 50th birthday... Then she bought a Caribbean blue MR2. Anyway, Terry saw the car, and said \"Mathematicians should not own a car like that.\" Mind you, later on he expressed a wish to own a DeLorean. Maybe for time travel? Not sure. As far as I know he never bought one.\n\n2. Small Gods. It hits all the buttons on organised religion, for me."
