        "text": "AN INDEPENDENT BROADCAST DOCUMENTARY\n\nMAKING THE DOCUMENTARY\n\n‘Plato sought to explain nature with five regular solid forms. Newton and Kepler bent Plato’s circle into an ellipse. Modern science analysed Plato’s shapes into particles and waves, and generalised the curves of Newton and Kepler to relative probabilities – still without a single ‘rough edge’. Now, more than two thousand years after Plato, nearly three hundred years after Newton, Benoît Mandelbrot has established a discovery that ranks with the laws of regular motion.’\n\nFirst and foremost I have to thank the incredible visionary Professor Benoît Mandelbrot for making his extraordinary and wonderful discovery of the set, which takes his name, on March 1st 1980. This profound discovery is at the very core of my film THE COLOURS OF INFINITY.\n\nOne of my goals as a filmmaker has been to share that rare and marvellous feeling of awe and wonder, which I have on occasions been granted, when contemplating this stunning and mysterious universe in which we live. Fractals changed the course of my life. I found something that inspired me. I struck out and took a new and unexpected direction. I have always been deeply inspired by mathematics and by the relationship between math, the mind and the physical, observable universe – particularly by the mystery of consciousness. In my films I have attempted to cross the gap between science and our emotional, creative and intellectual lives. The Mandelbrot set lent itself perfectly to this endeavour. Making this the film about the set opened my eyes, completely changed the direction of my life and put me on a new and incredibly exciting path. In the late summer of 1991 I was reading Professor Ian Stewart’s book on the new mathematics, DOES GOD PLAY DICE? and Sir Roger Penrose’s THE EMPEROR’S NEW MIND.\n\nOn August 12th 1991 a truly remarkable corn circle was discovered near Cambridge. This formation has come to be known as The Ickleton Mandelbrot. Ickelton is in the UK and is five miles from where I used to live. It quickly became part of local folklore.\n\nReading Ian Stewart’s and Roger Penrose’s books I was simultaneously discovering for myself for the first time the Mandelbrot set and fractal geometry. This was a revelation to me. I was reading the books as part of some ongoing research I was doing into cosmology and the new maths for a documentary I was hoping to make. Interestingly in both books the chapters on the M-set have most poetic and evocative titles and both refer to the set itself. Stewart calls his chapter ‘The Gingerbread Man’ and Penrose ‘The Land of Tor’Bled-Nam’. In a mathematics book! Well, right off they looked intriguing, and indeed they were. And once I had seen the Mandelbrot set and then read about it, I was hooked. So what was it about the M-set that drew me in? It was that this mathematical entity should look so organic – like an insect or a hairy potato – and that it was infinitely complex and yet born from such humble beginnings – a simple equation with just three components. You would be hard pressed to find anything more simple. As Professor Ian Stewart says in the film: “There’s an interesting parallel with the equation that almost everybody is familiar with – the only equation that everybody is familiar with: e = mc². Albert Einstein’s equation, which says that matter and energy are equivalent to each other. That was a very simple equation with very far-reaching consequences. And the equation for the Mandelbrot set is equally simple: z↔ z² + ci.” But there is one big, big difference, though, between the equation for the M-set and Einstein’s famous equation. In M’s equation there’s no equal sign. Instead there’s a double arrow. This works as a kind of two-way traffic sign, allowing the numbers to flow in both directions, constantly feeding back on themselves. The numbers go round and round in a loop. This effect is called iteration. The output of the first operation becomes the input of the second operation, becomes the output of the third operation and so on. In just this same way evolution proceeds in nature through an iterative feedback loop.\n\nThe structures, which we find in the Mandelbrot set do indeed remind us of many things, which we see in the natural world. There are spirals and tendrils like the finest gossamer, each precisely formed. These curlicues look, not so much like crystal structures, as like plants, which have grown with a regularity amounting to perfection. Some resemble the tails of sea horses, others like spiralling sea-shells or the petals of some intricate flower. No matter how far we dive into the Mandelbrot set, we can never reach the end of it, nor will it ever cease to create more patterns, more structures, more intricate forms. It is infinitely complex. Professor Rudy Rucker wrote: The image is a bit like a bug: a big warty buttocks-shape with a disk stuck onto it. There’s an antenna sticking out of the disk, and shish-kabobbed onto the antenna are tiny little Mandelbrot sets: buttocks, warts & disk. Each of the warts is a Mandelbrot disk, too, each with a wiggly antenna coming out, and with shish-kabobs of buttocks, warts & disks, with yet smaller antennae, buttocks, warts, and disks. Now, I found it amazing that this extraordinary creature should be born from this ridiculously simple equation. Eureka! The power and beauty of mathematics was revealed to me for the first time. I got it. The scales were lifted from my eyes and I could finally see the link between mathematics, the mind and the physical, observable universe. The point is that the universe is described most effectively and accurately using the language of mathematics. The sub-atomic world can only be described by physicists through the language of mathematics. There is no other way to talk about the very, very small.\n\nThere is one more extremely important component in this equation, which I have not yet mentioned, and which I must draw your attention to. It’s the letter i. This letter i is tacked onto the symbol c in the equation. i is a complex number. Complex numbers are among the most important ideas in the whole of mathematics. Complex numbers have their own arithmetic, algebra and analysis. They rely for their existence on an act of pure mathematical imagination: that is, to agree that minus 1 is allowed to have a square root. •. Complex numbers have two components or co-ordinates ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’. The imaginary component contains the factor ‘i’. It is this ‘i’, which has revealed the Mandelbrot set. Since the square root of a negative number cannot be placed anywhere on the number line, mathematicians up to the C19th could not ascribe any sense of reality to these quantities. The great Leibnitz, inventor of the Differential Calculus, attributed a mystical quality to •, seeing it as a manifestation of the Divine Spirit. He called it ‘that amphibian between being and not being’. A century later, Leonhard Euler wrote in his work ALGEBRA in words that still echo the same sense of wonder: ‘All expressions such as •are impossible or imaginary numbers, since they represent roots of negative quantities. Of such numbers we may truly assert that they are neither nothing, nor greater than nothing, nor less than nothing.’\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss declared forcefully that ‘an objective existence can be assigned to these imaginary beings.’ Gauss realised that there was no room for imaginary numbers anywhere on the real number line, which runs from east to west. He took the bold step of placing them on a perpendicular axis, through the point zero and running from north to south. This creates a co-ordinate system, where all the real numbers are placed on the ‘real axis’ and all the imaginary numbers on the ‘imaginary axis’. Imaginary numbers! Wonderful! That was it. I was caught and completely snared in this wild, weird and wonderful world.\n\nAnd so it was that the Mandelbrot set became the subject of the film I was to make. I saw it as a way into this mysterious mathematical world through which I could make this world accessible and fun for viewers. I researched a lot more, wrote my treatment and submitted it to the BBC, Discovery and Channel 4. And, as night follows day, the almost predictable rejections followed. I fumed for a year, thrashing about for a way to finance the project. But the penny finally dropped and I came straight to the conclusion that what I needed was a name – a famous name or names, to attach to the project – some star quality to give it that special feel and appeal to financiers. A star yes, but it had to be the right kind of star for the subject…………………………….Maths! It was difficult.\n\nThere used to be a little shop in Ladbroke Grove called Strange Attractions. Sadly it’s closed now, but at the time they were thriving, selling the products of the new mathematics – fractal geometry and chaos theory. Books, music, computer games, T-shirts, posters, coasters, cups and post- cards. Inside, everywhere I looked, I saw the M-set. Chatting with the sales assistant, I found out that I knew the owner in London in the sixties. Amongst other things, Greg Sams pioneered the Vegiburger. Now it was chaos theory. Greg and I went out for coffee. We talked about old times, shared our excitement in the new maths and then I told him my problem. Bingo!\n\nTwo months ago, Greg told me, Fred Clarke had been driving Sir Arthur C. Clarke back to his appartment in Holland Park, through Ladbroke Grove and past Greg’s shop. Arthur C.’s sharp eyes caught a glimpse of the colourful snapshot of the M-set, swinging in the wind on a big sign over Greg’s shop door. Arthur had Fred reverse the car back to the shop and park. Greg was in. And now comes the good bit. Clarke had just returned from Riyadh, where he wrote that he had:\n\n‘….the privilege of addressing the largest gathering of astronauts and cosmonauts ever assembled at one place (more than fifty, including Apollo 11’s Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, and the first “space-walker” Alexie Leonov). I decided to expand their horizons by introducing them to something really large! So, with astronaut Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz in the chair, I delivered a lavishly illustrated lecture: The Colours of Infinity – Exploring the Fractal Universe.\n\nArthur gave Greg Sams permission to publish the speech. When I arrived Greg had just that week received the printer’s proof. He gave me a copy and the good doctor’s fax number in Colombo, Sri Lanka and off I went to compose a persuasive letter. I faxed my two-paged plea the next morning, but forgot to inform my wife, Jenny, that I’d sent it, more or less expecting nothing to come back. So when Arthur C. Clarke rang back two hours later, Jenny was completely unprepared. Only her quick responses saved the situation as she took on board what was happening. She calmed down, took notes and came away with his agreement to a two-day shoot at his house in Colombo. Only one problem now: no money, love! But word got about surprisingly quickly and the finance started to flow. Not a torrent, but enough of a trickle for us to afford to take a British crew and equipment to Sri Lanka for 4 days. Jenny put in some of her savings, as did two of her friends, my close friend and my friend’s Mum. The crew all agreed to forgo salaries and settle for percentage points according to the number of days/weeks (in my case years!) put into the project. Everything else had to be paid for: equipment, stock, flights, excess baggage, food, accomodation, insurances and so on and so on. Paul Sinclair bravely undertook to produce the programme, relying on me to cover the writing and directing. John Lamborn jumped at the chance of pointing his camera at Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nFull of fear and trepidation, we entered Arthur C. Clarke’s humble, but high-tech, apartment. I shook his hand and presented my offerings – three Mandelbrot mugs and some fractal coasters from Strange Attractions. As he was opening the package, he said, ‘Nigel, if you hadn’t turned up to make this film, I would have done it sooner or later with someone, somehow! ‘ Nice timing. A.C.C. and I talked for the best part of the next day, came to an agreement on the programme structure that I was proposing and wrote his links. We kept them all short. We had to. Autocue – teleprompting – was not within our budget! Arthur C. Clarke was wonderful. Passionate about the topic and furiously keen to do a good job. He is particularly inspiring in the links, which he makes, and with his speculative ideas regarding the significance of the set and with fractals in general.\n\nFortunately we had seen eye-to-eye on the project immediately and things have stayed like that every inch of the way. In just two days we had everything we needed in the can and were off.\n\nBy this time I had got hold of some moving colour, pictures of the Mandelbrot set on videotape. This tape had been made some two years earlier by a group of American mathematicians working in downtime during the installation of the Cray super-computer at Cornel University. I needed somewhere to cut a short pilot together to show what we had done and give an idea of what still needed to be done. We were out of money. Boyd Catling of Original Films came to the rescue and offered me the use of his off-line suite when it wasn’t booked-out.\n\nI’d known David Gilmour since teenage days in Cambridge and had watched with awe and wonder his rise to stardom with the Pink Floyd. So I took my pilot round to David’s house, ran it for him a couple of times and, with very little persuasion on my part, he agreed to do the music for the programme. Once again, it didn’t take long for the finance to appear. But we needed a fair old wedge this time. We had to go to Warwick University to shoot Ian Stewart, our star academic, and we needed to cross the pond too. Professor Benoît Mandelbrot, the grand discoverer of the set, was in up-state New York and our inventor, Dr Michael Barnsley was at Iterated Systems in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nWe managed eventually to pull all the finance we needed and the same crew boarded the plane at Heathrow, only this time since we needed more help we took my daughter Daisy along as our PA. What struck me most forcefully throughout the shooting of the production was how happy all the contributors were to talk about the subject. And, I’d say, that this aspect does come across loud and clear in the programme.\n\nI set out to make, not a deeply mathematical, analytical piece, but rather a celebration of a remarkable discovery. I wanted it to be fun. I knew it had to entertain at some level if it was going to reach a really wide audience.\n\nWith the shooting over, nothing remained but the edit. But how? Simon Gilbert, an old friend, offered his services. Simon and I then cast around for ways and means of off-lining. We couldn’t go back to Boyd Catling again. In the event we put the programme together over a nine- month period in a whole host of different suites. Most of it in a shed out by Heathrow Airport. Nights, weekends, holidays. You name it! While Simon and I ached away on the low-band videotape edit system a young mathematics graduate from Cambridge, called Will Rood, was working wonders on his Acorn Archimedes computer. We needed new fractal pictures, new M-set zooms and Bill could make them. Strange Attractions! I can’t say the off-line edit was all fun. It wasn’t. It was painful. But we did get there and getting there was just wonderful. I have to say the end product was all that I had hoped it would be. It was just as I imagined it would be. It was exactly to my original treatment. And, it had quite a bit more to it than I had ever expected. The thread was thrown beautifully from one participant to the next. The programme flowed and David Gilmour’s music was a perfect fit. The on-line was completed in fits and starts at over an uncomfortably extended period at Essential Pictures and at Barrie Hinchcliffe Productions. Kevin Pyne did an expert sound dub and we had our finished 52-minute programme.\n\nI sent a VHS copy to Arthur C. Clarke and he faxed back: ‘I have now seen the programme a second time and am even more impressed. It really is stunning. I hope it wins lots of awards!’ That fax came as an enormous relief for me. I had expected him to like it, but nonetheless I really did breathe a huge sigh of relief when he responded so positively. Same thing again when I showed it to David Gilmour. He also thought it was excellent. I had the stamp of approval I needed from the big boys! We had that – yes, and we had our programme, yes. But, we didn’t have a distributor! No way for us to get it out there! No way to get it seen. Fortunately Paul Sinclair had been able to take the pilot cut down to MIPCOM in Cannes a couple of times. So seeds had been sown and we hoped that interest was growing. It had been. And, before we knew what had hit us, we were spoilt for choice.\n\nWe had three potential players at our door. In the event we went with Beyond Distribution, based in Sydney. We signed our contract with them on 17th November 1995. Since that date they have sold the programme for broadcast in\n\nJapan, The UK’s Channel Four, Holland, Canada, Russia, Finland, Argentina, Venezuela, Russia, Poland, Bosnia, Hungary, Spain, Italy, the CIS, Israel, over 70 PBS stations in the USA, Finland, Columbia, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nMy life was changed by making this film.\n\nMORE DOCUMENTARY FILMS\n\nFollowing hard on the heels of THE COLOURS OF INFINITY I won two awards with it in the USA. The first was from The Alfred P Sloan Foundation to make a film about Benoît Mandelbrot’s life and work. This documentary film came to be known as CLOUDS ARE NOT SPHERES – The Life and Work of a Maverick Mathematician.\n\nThe synopsis for this film reads as follows: Professor Benoît Mandelbrot has led an extraordinarily rich and varied life. Full of twists and turns, his career has very much paralleled and reflected powerful aspects of the new geometry, which he has discovered and developed. Fractal geometry is the geometry of nature, of familiar and apparently random forms like trees, coastlines, rivers, and lightning. With fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot has given us a new language for use throughout the sciences. Fractal geometry has a powerful and enlightening effect on people, who come across it and understand it. This new language is changing, enhancing and transforming our lives in many, many ways.\n\nIn this documentary, hosted by Martin Shaw, Benoît Mandelbrot tells his story in his own unique style, supported by interviews with a over dozen esteemed contributors, including Nobel Laureate Professor Ivar Giaever.\n\nThe second award was from the John Templeton Foundation and it was given to me make a film about Professor Michael Barnsley and his work in mathematics. I called this film IS GOD A NUMBER?, which was my buzzy shorthand for what I wanted the film to ask: Is God a Mathematician? The physical observable universe is described in the language of math. This is the language of Quantum Physics. There is no other language to describe the world of the very, very small.\n\nThe synopsis for this film opens with the statement: For centuries astronomers and mathematicians have gazed in awe and wonder at the heavens, seeking to discover if there is a master plan. From the finite to the infinite, from the smallest sub-atomic particles to the entirety of the universe in which we live, there is evidence of the work of a master mathematician. And it continues: Examining in depth the power and the limits of mathematics to explain and describe the world we live in, IS GOD A NUMBER? asks if we can compress and retrieve pictorial images in the interactive world, can we also use mathematics to describe the way our brains work and to help explain the mystery of consciousness? Professor Michael Barnsley, Sir Roger Penrose and Sir John Polkinghorne, three of the world’s most renowned scientists, use nature and exciting computer graphics to bring these questions and concepts to the viewer in a fascinating review of current thinking, which leaves us wondering if the creation of the world was indeed mathematical.\n\nTaken together these two films produced after THE COLOURS OF INFINITY have had a profound effect on my perception and appreciation of this world. All three films have filled me with awe and wonder, transforming, deepening and enhancing my experience of life. They have opened my eyes, cleared my vision and expanded my consciousness way beyond my wildest dreams!\n\nTHE BOOK\n\nIn early October 2010 the international publishers SPRINGER will publish the book based on the film THE COLOURS OF INFINITY in hard copy and as an e-book."
