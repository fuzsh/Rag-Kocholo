        "text": "JUNCTION ONE\n\nFrom a distance, the magical maze looks drab and uninviting. Most of it seems to be built from faceless concrete slabs, except for some kind of tower that rises above it, almost hidden by the perpetual mists that engulf the structure. Squads of faceless subhumans labour in its shadow, making piles of stones and recording their numbers on slates.\n\nThe mists clear for an instant, and the tower’s surface flashes in a shaft of sunlight. It is made from something shiny.\n\nIvory?\n\nBefore you can decide, the mists close again.\n\nAs you approach the colossal structure, however, it slowly seems to change. It is as if its magic is so great that some of it is leaking out. No longer a concrete monolith, it begins to reveal artistic embellishments – curlicues and trellises, mythological gargoyles, huge buttresses of fossil-bearing stone. The faceless sub-humans flee into concealed burrows. Their places are taken by resplendent beings who radiate serenity and wisdom.\n\nThe tower peeps through again, but now it seems to be made not of ivory, but of brushed aluminium.\n\nCloser still, and the wealth of detail begins to be overwhelming. The magical maze possesses an almost tangible aura. Its quality is surreal. The more ordinary it looks, the more remarkable it feels.\n\nYou could swear it was growing as you watched.\n\nThe path passes through a series of gates, like canal locks. Signposts decorated with esoteric symbols point in every direction. You are about to panic when you see one that says ENTRANCE THIS WAY.\n\nYou climb a long spiral staircase to a broad piazza, surrounded on three sides by vast stone walls. Strange cabbalistic designs cover its surface – they draw you in, compulsively, towards a place where the stones have collapsed to leave a small opening.\n\nYou clamber through. You are in some kind of garden. At the same time, you are in no doubt that it is a maze. The magical maze.\n\nJust within the entrance to the maze there is a small flowerbed. It is pentagonal in shape, as befits a flowerbed in a mathematical maze, and it contains a single row of flowers. There is a lily, a geranium, a delphinium, a marigold, an aster, and three daisies,\n\nAs you approach, you disturb a pair of white rabbits, which have been nibbling at the grass verge. One hides behind the geranium, the other behind the delphinium. You are vaguely reminded of a childhood rhyme – but it was about a dormouse , was it not? (The symbol indicates that further information can be found in the ‘Pointers’ section at the back of this book.)\n\nFlowers, rabbits, a pentagon. A strange selection, presumably serving some symbolic function? You wonder if there is any reason behind it. Idly you count the petals – ‘She loves me, she loves me not ...’. But, as a good environmentalist, you leave the petals firmly affixed to the flowers. Curious ... The lily has three petals, the geranium five, the delphinium eight, the marigold thirteen, the aster twenty-one, and the daisies have thirty-four, fifty-five, and eighty-nine.\n\nPerhaps there is some rationale to the choice of flowers, for the numbers increase steadily. How steadily? You list the numbers in order:\n\n3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.\n\nThey feel like they ought to have a pattern, but if they do it’s not a familiar one. The numbers are not consecutive, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, They are not all odd, neither are they all even. They are not powers of two, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, They are not the primes, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. They are not squares, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. One of them, 8, is a cube: 8 = 2×2×2, The rest are not. Yet they have their own magic, their own aura of significance. They mean something – or else they would not have been planted where they are,\n\nBut what? Why have they been planted here, just inside the entrance to the magical maze?\n\nAnd what do they have to do with rabbits and pentagons?\n\nPassage One\n\nTHE MAGIC OF NUMBERS\n\nThe answer to riddle of the flowerbed is some way off, towards the end of the first passage of the maze – just before we pause for breath, turn through the gap in the wall, and head into the second passage. It is an answer that captures the true magic of numbers, the ability of mathematics to illuminate the secret corners of our world and point to unexpected interconnections. But our first steps must begin with more mundane magic – magic of the stage variety. We’ll return to the flowers and the rabbits later, when we’re better prepared.\n\nLet’s begin with some very simple magic:\n\nThink of a number.\n\nAdd ten. Double the result. Subtract six.\n\nDivide by two. Take away the number you first thought of.\n\nThe answer is seven. Always.\n\nWe’ve all come across this kind of trick, and we all know the general principle upon which it rests. Somehow that elusive and unknown number that enters the calculation at the beginning is magically persuaded to disappear again by the end.\n\nWhy, though, does it work?\n\nWell-meaning teachers often tell you that the way to understand mathematics is through concrete examples. If you try an example of the party-trick that I’ve just described, you can easily check that your choice does indeed lead to the result ‘seven’. For instance:\n\nThe trouble is, that calculation gives hardly any insight into why the answer is always seven, whatever number you choose.\n\nAnd that’s the first lesson about thinking like a mathematician: sometimes it pays to think in generalities, not specifics. Here, an example doesn’t help very much. Of course, you could do a hundred such examples – and I promise you’ll always get seven as the answer. The cumulative effect of the examples might convince you that the calculation is rigged so that it always produces the answer seven – but it won’t tell you how it’s rigged. And mathematicians have learned to be very wary indeed of ‘experimental evidence’, because on plenty of occasions what looked like very strong evidence for some suspected mathematical truth actually turned out to be totally misleading, and the ‘truth’ was revealed as a falsehood.\n\nIf concrete examples don’t help, what else can we do?\n\nWe can try to think on some level of generality. As simple as possible, but not too simple, as Albert Einstein is reputed to have said.\n\nThe master-mathematicians of ancient Egypt had a general way of thinking about such questions. They called the unknown number ‘heap’, meaning ‘some fixed but unknown number’. Let’s try the calculation with heaps:\n\nEasy!\n\nBelieve it or not, you’ve just done two things that most people think of as being difficult and sophisticated.\n\nOne is algebra. The other, conceptually deeper, is proof.\n\nAlgebra is a kind of symbolic reasoning that works with numbers without knowing their actual values. Proofs provide a once-and-for-all guarantee that certain lines of reasoning always work. Instead of checking lots of examples, you give a logical argument to show that your method always works – which in this case means that the answer is always the same number, namely 7. It makes no difference what value you assign to ‘heap’: after all the arithmetical machinations, the heap magically disappears and only non-heap numbers remain.\n\nAdmittedly, our proof, with its little drawings of heaps, doesn’t look much like algebra. But that’s just a matter of notation. To make it look like normal algebra, all you have to do is replace ‘heap’ by a letter of the alphabet (the traditional one being x) and replace the blobs by conventional numbers. So now the proof looks like this:\n\nIt’s the same as the heaps. As Carl Friedrich Gauss, probably the greatest mathematician who ever lived, once said, in mathematics, what matters is notions, not notations.\n\nIdeas, not symbols.\n\nUnfortunately, you have to spend a lot of time getting used to the symbols before your mind latches on to the ideas. Still, here we are, only three pages into Passage One, and you’ve done some algebra and invented a proof.\n\nWhen you’re hot, you’re hot!\n\nSNARK ARITHMETIC\n\nLewis Carroll, most famous as the author of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, was a mathematician, and he made good use of his mathematics in his writing. His long humorous poem The Hunting of the Snark includes a ‘think of a number’ trick. The Beaver, one of the central characters, has been told that ‘what I tell you three times is true’. The Butcher hears a sound. ‘ ’Tis the voice of the Jubjub!’ he declares. ‘ ’Tis the note of the Jubjub!’ he continues, charging the Beaver with the task of keeping count. ‘ ’Tis the note of the Jubjub!’ he adds. ‘The proof is complete, if only I’ve stated it thrice.’ But the poor Beaver goes into a panic at the prospect of encountering the terrible Jubjub bird, and becomes convinced that it must have lost count. The only solution is to calculate how many times the Butcher has made his frightening declaration (Figure 1). ‘Two added to one – if that could but be done,’ it snivels, remembering that in its youth it had ‘taken no pains with its sums’. The Butcher, taking pity on the poor creature, affirms that in his opinion the computation is probably possible . At any rate, the Butcher brings paper, ink, portfolio, and pens, and attempts to figure out the answer in a rather unorthodox manner:\n\nTaking Three as the subject to reason about –\n\nA convenient number to state –\n\nWe add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out\n\nBy One Thousand diminished by Eight.\n\nThe result we proceed to divide, as you see,\n\nBy Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two:\n\nThen subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be\n\nExactly and perfectly true.\n\nThe procedure is complete nonsense, of course, but that’s true of much of the poem. Nevertheless, it is instructive nonsense. If you carry out the arithmetic, you’ll find that the ‘exactly and perfectly true’ answer is three, which is what the Butcher wanted it to be. But there are some clues in the numbers employed which suggest that the Butcher has rigged the calculation so that he can get whatever answer he wants, namely, whichever ‘convenient number’ he chooses as ‘the subject to reason about’.\n\nFigure 1 The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens ...\n\nAmong the clues are the occurrence of ‘add Seven, and Ten’ and, later, ‘subtract Seventeen’ – instructions that, in the absence of anything in between, would leave the number unchanged. What is in between is an even more blatant clue: ‘One Thousand diminished by Eight’ is equal to 992, and so is /Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two’. Since we multiply by the first and promptly divide by the second, again these cancel out.\n\nCircumstantial evidence, but we can do better. Let’s work through the algebra, taking x as ‘the subject to reason about’ – Carroll’s term for ‘heap’. Here goes:\n\nJust as we suspected!\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS NINE\n\nWith a little ingenuity, this kind of self-fulfilling process can be disguised in all sorts of ways. There is a stage magician’s trick which exploits the same general principle in a geometric guise. The magician places twenty or so coins on the table in the form of a figure 9 (Figure 2). The ‘tail’ of the 9 contains, say, seven coins; the rest form a closed circle. The tail runs into the circle at a coin which I shall call the ‘junction’. While the magician’s back is turned, a victim selected from the audience is told to think of a number bigger than seven (the number of coins in the tail). They start counting from the tip of the tail, running anticlockwise round the circle, until they reach their chosen number. Then they start counting at 1 again, moving one coin clockwise for each number in the count, and stop on reaching their chosen number. The victim conceals a tiny piece of paper with the message THIS ONE underneath this coin.\n\nFigure 2 The mysterious nine.\n\nThe magician now turns round and unhesitatingly picks up the same coin.\n\nHow does he do it? In fact, the counting procedure will always end on the same coin, no matter what number was chosen – as long as it is bigger than the number of coins in the tail of the 9. The part of the anticlockwise count that goes round the circle is cancelled out by the corresponding part of the clockwise count. If the second count were to divert back down the tail, then of course it would end at the tip – exactly where it started. The victim would have counted the chosen number twice, the second count exactly undoing the first because the direction is reversed. However, the magician has cunningly insisted that the second count should stay on the circle. So the victim arrives at the junction with seven counts left to go – the number of coins in the tail – and so his second count ends on the seventh coin clockwise from the junction.\n\nHere it is in algebra. Suppose the victim chooses x, bigger than 7. He counts 7 coins up to the junction, which leaves an anticlockwise count of x-7 from the junction onwards. This is followed by a further x in the clockwise direction. The first x-7 return the count to the junction, so that x-(x- 7)=7 coins remain to be counted. Therefore the count ends on the seventh coin clockwise from the junction.\n\nThis time an example does illuminate the argument (teachers are often right, too). Figure 3(a) shows how the count goes if the victim chooses the number 13. The trick is especially transparent if the victim makes the second count backwards, from 13 to 1, as in Figure 3(b). Figure 3(c) does it with x’s.\n\nThe trick can be repeated, but to stop the audience realising that the count always ends on the same coin, no matter what the victim chooses, you should use different numbers of coins and vary the number in the tail.\n\nTAP-AN-ANIMAL\n\nThere are other ways to make a chosen number ‘cancel out’. Sometimes the number itself can be disguised, so that the audience is less inclined to look for arithmetical trickery. A delightfully simple example of this is the Tap-an-Animal trick, devised by Martin Gardner. Gardner is a journalist and writer who for many years wrote a regular Mathematical Games column in Scientific American; he is also an amateur magician. In this trick, intended for young children, his two interests come together.\n\nFigure 3 How the mysterious nine works: (a) an example; (b) the same example with backwards numbering; (c) doing it with x’s.\n\nThe trick makes use of a diagram featuring eight animals at the tips of an eight-pointed star (Figure 4). The victim chooses an animal – say the monkey. The magician starts tapping his way round the star with his wand, beginning at the butterfly, going on to the rhinoceros, and continuing in the same direction, anticlockwise round the star. The victim silently spells out the name of the chosen animal, one letter per tap – M, O, N, K, E, Y – and shouts ‘stop!’ upon reaching the final letter.\n\nLo and behold, the wand rests on the monkey.\n\nThe secret is straightforward. Three taps round the star is the COW (three letters). Four taps round is the LION (four letters). Five taps round is the HORSE (five letters). In general, an animal with x letters in its name lives x taps round the star. Starting with BUTTERFLY is a device to distract attention from this pattern – BUTTERFLY has nine letters, and since the star has eight points, the ninth tap returns to the position of the first. And RHINOCEROS, with ten letters, lives on the second point of the star – which is also reached after ten taps, because 10 = 8 + 2.\n\nAdults quickly grasp the basis of the trick, but similar games can be played which puzzle even adults. Here’s an unusual example, which involves a board with numbers and letters (Figure 5). Get your victim to choose any number on the board, and then spell it out, letter by letter. Add together the corresponding numbers (subtracting those on black squares, adding those on white squares). The result will always be plus or minus the number you chose. For instance, if the victim chooses 11 you spell out ELEVEN, which translates into –4 + 24–4 + 1–4–2, which is 11. Lee Sallows, the inventor, had to do a lot of clever mathematics to make that trick work.\n\nFigure 4 Tap-an-Animal.\n\nIn 1940 Gardner produced an advertising free gift, the Magic Tap-a-Drink card, based on the same principle. The card had ten holes, arranged in a circle, and beside each was the name of a cocktail. The victim picks a cocktail, then the magician turns the card over and taps a pencil round the holes in turn while the victim silently spells out the drink. Then the magician pokes the pencil through the hole, and turns the card over, to show that he has correctly located the cocktail. Figure 6 shows a variant that uses numbers instead. Start at the arrow and tap in a clockwise direction (ignore hyphens when spelling the names). SIX, with three letters, is in position three, and so on. For better effect, use the number symbols, not the names: I’ve written the names on the diagram to make the principle clearer.\n\nFigure 5 Lee Sallows’ magic square.\n\nFigure 6 Tap-a-Number.\n\nDAYS IN THE WILDERNESS\n\nA certain amount of clever concealment goes into these puzzles. Although the number in position three (namely 6) has three letters, the number in position two (24) doesn’t have two letters. Instead, it has ten letters. This makes the numerical pattern less obvious. Why do we use ten here? Because most other numbers won’t work. If you count ten steps round a circle of eight dots, then you arrive at the second dot anyway. You wouldn’t have done that if you’d counted nine dots, or eleven. However, you’ll still end up on the second dot if you count 18 steps round, or 26, or 34 ... The common feature of these numbers is that they are all two greater than a multiple of eight: 0 + 2, 8 + 2, 16 + 2, 24 + 2, 32 + 2. Since the circle has eight dots in it, moving round it eight dots brings you back to where you started. So, in effect, 8 is ‘the same as’ 0. Every multiple of 8 is ‘the same as’ 0, for much the same reason: you may go round more times, but you still end up where you started. What determines where you end up is not the number of dots you count, but how many of them are left after you’ve got rid of multiples of eight.\n\nBuried in this innocent observation is a profound variation on the traditional number system, one that proves invaluable whenever numbers ‘wrap round’ to eat their own tails. This event is far more common than my description might suggest. It happens, for example, in many areas of applied science: those where the same sequence of events repeats indefinitely. Astronomical cycles, such as the motion of the Moon round the Earth or the Earth round the Sun, are typical examples.\n\nHuman calendars – I use the plural for good reasons, as you’ll shortly see – are based on astronomical cycles. Not surprisingly, this kind of ‘wraparound arithmetic’ is very useful in setting up and comparing calendar systems.\n\nLet’s start with a simple warm-up problem.\n\nIt is Sunday. John the Baptist goes out into the wilderness, due to return after forty days. What day of the week will he return?\n\nWell, you could just make a big list (Table 1).\n\nThe list tells you that John will reappear on Friday. But it’s a cumbersome method. What if John had gone into the wilderness for forty thousand days? Or forty million? We can’t just make bigger and bigger lists!\n\nFortunately, there’s a pattern in the list, and once you’ve seen it you don’t need the list at all. Let’s take a look at the Sundays. These occur on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 of John the Baptist’s sojourn. It’s not hard to see the pattern: these are the multiples of 7. OK, now what about Mondays? Those occur on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36. Again, there’s a pattern – but the easiest way to see it is to observe that Monday is always one day later than Sunday. So Mondays correspond to days that are 1 more than a multiple of 7. By the same argument, Tuesdays correspond to days that are 2 more than a multiple of 7, and so on.\n\nHow can we tell that a number is, say, 2 more than a multiple of 7? Easy: divide by 7 and see if the remainder is 2. For example, 72 divided by 7 goes 10 times with remainder 2 – meaning that 72 = 10 × 7 + 2 – so day 72 would be a Tuesday as well. So would day 702, or day 7,000,002.\n\nIn other words, what we should do is give the days of the week code numbers, as in Table 2.\n\nThen the day of the week for a given number of days in the wilderness is whichever day corresponds to the remainder on dividing that number by 7.\n\nFor 40 days’ sojourn, all we do is divide 40 by 7 and find the remainder. Now, 7 into 40 goes 5 times, with remainder 5 (that is, 40= 7×5 + 5). So the answer is whichever day had code 5, and that’s Friday.\n\nFor 40,000 days’ sojourn, we divide 40,000 by 7 and find the remainder. Now, 7 into 40,000 goes 5714 times, with remainder 2 (that is, 40,000 = 7×5714 + 2). The day whose code is 2 is Tuesday.\n\nFor 40,000,000 days’ sojourn, we divide 40,000,000 by 7 and find the remainder. Now, 7 into 40,000,000 goes 5,714,285 times, with remainder 5 (that is, 40,000,000 = 7×5,714,285 + 5). The day whose code is 5 is Friday, again. If John had stayed for forty million days, he would have come out on the same day of the week that he did after forty days.\n\nMODULAR ARITHMETIC\n\nMathematicians have formalised this kind of calculation. The idea was first systematised by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his monumental work Disquisitiones arithmeticae, the second great number theory book . He called it ‘arithmetic to a modulus’, and it goes like this. Choose a whole number, and for reference call it the modulus. In John-the-Baptist arithmetic, the modulus is 7, and for the sake of illustration we’ll use that modulus for the moment.\n\nSay that two numbers x and y are congruent to the modulus 7, written\n\nx ≡ y (mod 7)\n\nif their difference x-y is an exact multiple of 7. For example,\n\n40 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nbecause 40 – 5 = 35 = 5 × 7.\n\nThe solution to the John-the-Baptist puzzle boils down to this: day numbers that are congruent mod 7 have the same code, and thus correspond to the same day of the week. Day 40 has the same code as day 5, and is therefore a Friday.\n\nIn fact, we can quickly find the code from the day number by observing that it is equal to the remainder on dividing the day number by 7. The remainder is what’s left over when you subtract the biggest multiple of 7 that does not exceed the day number, and as such it must always be one of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nGauss observed that you can do arithmetic mod 7, using only the seven numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 – and that the usual algebraic rules still apply. Well, there’s one rule that no longer applies: the assumption that 7 is different from 0. In arithmetic mod 7, the number 7 is the same as 0 – well, it’s congruent to 0, which is effectively the same thing.\n\nFor example, you can add numbers mod 7 by adding them in the usual way and then replacing the result by its remainder on division by 7. So\n\n2 + 3 ≡ 5 (mod7),\n\n3 + 5 ≡ 8 ≡ 1 (mod7),\n\n4 + 6 ≡ 10"
