        "text": "In October 2017 we have started the LThMath Book Club on Goodreads and we are still doing it. In 2019, we have also created a Facebook Group for it. At this point, we find quite a number of books that we have read together. On this page, you will find a list of all of the books we have read in this Book Club. Enjoy!\n\n“Tales of Impossibility: The 2000-Year Quest to Solve the Mathematical Problems of Antiquity” by David S. Richeson\n\nTales of Impossibility recounts the intriguing story of the renowned problems of antiquity, four of the most famous and studied questions in the history of mathematics. First posed by the ancient Greeks, these compass and straightedge problems–squaring the circle, trisecting an angle, doubling the cube, and inscribing regular polygons in a circle–have served as ever-present muses for mathematicians for more than two millennia. David Richeson follows the trail of these problems to show that ultimately their proofs–demonstrating the impossibility of solving them using only a compass and straightedge–depended on and resulted in the growth of mathematics.\n\n“The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus: The Mathematics of Christmas” by Hannah Fry, Thomas Oléron Evans\n\nFull of diagrams, sketches and graphs, beautiful equations, Markov chains and matrices, Proof That Santa Exists brightens up the bleak midwinter with stockingfuls of mathematiccal marvels. And proves once and for all that maths isn’t just for old men with white hair and beards who associate with elves.\n\n“The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage” by Sydney Padua\n\nThe Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage presents a rollicking alternate reality in which Lovelace and Babbage do build the Difference Engine and then use it to build runaway economic models, battle the scourge of spelling errors, explore the wilder realms of mathematics, and, of course, fight crime—for the sake of both London and science. Complete with extensive footnotes that rival those penned by Lovelace herself, historical curiosities, and never-before-seen diagrams of Babbage’s mechanical, steam-powered computer, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is wonderfully whimsical, utterly unusual, and, above all, entirely irresistible.\n\n“Beyond Infinity: An Expedition to the Outer Limits of Mathematics” by Eugenia Cheng\n\nIn Beyond Infinity, Eugenia Cheng takes us on a staggering journey from elemental math to its loftiest abstractions. Along the way she considers how to use a chessboard to plan a worldwide dinner party, how to make a chicken-sandwich sandwich, and how to create infinite cookies from a finite ball of dough. Beyond Infinity shows how this little symbol holds the biggest idea of all.\n\n“Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms” by Hannah Fry\n\nHello World takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings, showing us how algorithms are written and implemented, and demonstrates the ways in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By weaving in relatable, real world stories with accessible explanations of the underlying mathematics that power algorithms, Hello World helps us to determine their power, expose their limitations, and examine whether they really are improvement on the human systems they replace.\n\n“Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy” by Cathy O’Neil\n\nWe live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives—where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance—are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated. But as Cathy O’Neil reveals in this shocking book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they’re wrong.\n\n“Hypatia of Alexandria: Mathematician and Martyr” by Michael A.B. Deakin\n\nThis is the first biography of Hypatia to integrate all aspects of her life. Mathematician Michael Deakin emphasizes that, though she was a philosopher, she was first and foremost a mathematician and astronomer of great accomplishment. In a fascinating narrative that brings to life a richly diverse ancient society, he describes her work so that the mathematics, presented in straightforward terms, finds its true place in the context of her life as a whole. Deakin supplies full detail on the historical, intellectual, and religious context of Hypatia’s times. He also analyzes the pattern of her life and thought, and finally gives an account of the events leading up to her lynch-mob execution.\n\n“How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method” by George Pólya\n\nA perennial bestseller by eminent mathematician G. Polya, How to Solve It will show anyone in any field how to think straight. In lucid and appealing prose, Polya reveals how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown can be of help in attacking any problem that can be “reasoned” out–from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of readers have relished Polya’s deft–indeed, brilliant–instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of the problem.\n\n“Math with Bad Drawings” by Ben Orlin\n\nEschewing the tired old curriculum that begins in the wading pool of addition and subtraction and progresses to the shark infested waters of calculus (AKA the Great Weed Out Course), Orlin instead shows us how to think like a mathematician by teaching us a new game of Tic-Tac-Toe, how to understand an economic crisis by rolling a pair of dice, and the mathematical reason why you should never buy a second lottery ticket.\n\n“Weird Maths: At the Edge of Infinity and Beyond”by David Darling, Agnijo Banerjee\n\nIn this delightful journey of discovery, David Darling and extraordinary child prodigy Agnijo Banerjee draw connections between the cutting edge of modern maths and life as we understand it, delving into the strange – would we like alien music? – and venturing out on quests to consider the existence of free will and the fantastical future of quantum computers. Packed with puzzles and paradoxes, mind-bending concepts and surprising solutions, this is for anyone who wants life’s questions answered – even those you never thought to ask.\n\n“Lewis Carroll in Numberland: His Fantastical Mathematical Logical Life” by Robin J. Wilson\n\nJust when we thought we knew everything about Lewis Carroll, here comes a highly original biography that will appeal to Alice fans everywhere. Fascinated by the inner life of Charles Lutwidge Dodson, Robin Wilson, a Carroll scholar and a noted mathematics professor, has produced this revelatory book—filled with more than one hundred striking and often playful illustrations—that examines the many inspirations and sources for Carroll’s fantastical writings, mathematical and otherwise.\n\n“Ten Great Ideas about Chance” by Persi Diaconis, Brian Skyrms\n\nComplete with a brief probability refresher, Ten Great Ideas about Chance is certain to be a hit with anyone who wants to understand the secrets of probability and how they were discovered. Persi Diaconis and Brian Skyrms begin with Girolamo Cardano, a sixteenth-century physician, mathematician, and professional gambler who helped develop the idea that chance actually can be measured.\n\n“Cakes, Custard and Category Theory: Easy recipes for understanding complex maths” by Eugenia Cheng\n\nFrom simple numeracy to category theory (‘the mathematics of mathematics’), Cheng takes us through the joys of the mathematical world. Packed with recipes, puzzles to surprise and delight even the innumerate, Cake, Custard & Category Theory will whet the appetite of maths whizzes and arithmophobes alike. (Not to mention aspiring cooks: did you know you can use that slow cooker to make clotted cream?) This is maths at its absolute tastiest.\n\n“The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics” by Clifford A. Pickover\n\nBeginning millions of years ago with ancient “ant odometers” and moving through time to our modern-day quest for new dimensions, it covers 250 milestones in mathematical history. Each topic gets a lavishly illustrated spread with stunning color art, along with formulas and concepts, fascinating facts about scientists’ lives, and real-world applications of the theorems.\n\n“Taming the Infinite: The Story of Mathematics from the First Numbers to Chaos Theory” by Ian Stewart\n\nIn his famous straightforward style, Ian Stewart explains each major development—from the first number systems to chaos theory—and considers how each affected society and changed everyday life forever. Maintaining a personal touch, he introduces all of the outstanding mathematicians of history, from the key Babylonians, Greeks, and Egyptians, via Newton and Descartes, to Fermat, Babbage, and Godel, and demystifies math’s key concepts without recourse to complicated formulae.\n\n“Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions” by Edwin A. Abbott\n\nThis masterpiece of science (and mathematical) fiction is a delightfully unique and highly entertaining satire that has charmed readers for more than 100 years. The work of English clergyman, educator and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.\n\n“A Mathematician’s Apology” by G.H. Hardy\n\nWritten in 1940 as his mathematical powers were declining, G.H. Hardy’s apology offers an engaging account of the thoughts of a man known for his eccentricities as well as his brilliance in mathematics.\n\n“The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth” by Paul Hoffman\n\nBased on a National Magazine Award-winning article, this masterful biography of Hungarian-born Paul Erdos is both a vivid portrait of an eccentric genius and a layman’s guide to some of this century’s most startling mathematical discoveries."
