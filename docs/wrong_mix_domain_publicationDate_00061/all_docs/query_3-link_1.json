        "text": "Loophole\n\npublished by Elsewhen Press\n\nDon’t poke your nose down a wormhole – you never know what you might find!\n\nTwo universes are joined by a wormhole pair that forms a ‘loophole’, with an icemoon orbiting through it, shared between two different planetary systems in the two universes. We are introduced to a civilisation with uploaded minds in virtual reality served by artificial humans; a ravening Horde of replicating machines that kill stars; real humans from a decrepit system of colony worlds; and a race of hyperintelligent but somewhat vague aliens.\n\nWho will close the loophole… who will exploit it?\n\nStephen Baxter, award-winning author of the Xeelee sequence, Time Slip and many others, said, about Loophole:\n\n“When universes collide … A multicosmos at war in a scenario of staggering, but scientifically authentic, invention … As if the Marvel multiverse collided with 2001: A Space Odyssey … I am awed, and I don’t awe easily. The highest of high-concept SF.”\n\nHenry Gee, Senior Editor at Nature, author of A (Very) Short History of Life on Earth and the Sigil SF trilogy, said:\n\n“There’s Hard SF. There’s Wide-Screen Baroque. Now with Ian Stewart’s Loophole we have Wrap-Around Rococo. Daringly inventive, Loophole is a mind-fryingly, Möbius-twistingly intense SF adventure of the first order.”\n\nMessage From Earth\n\nand other SF stories\n\n“Make your own wormhole in your own home.”\n\nKitten’s Own Young Scientist Magazine.\n\nOliver Gurney: Real Ale fanatic and eccentric genius whose radical inventions inadvertently trigger a plague of microbots, release a digital analogue of Adolf Hitler into the global computer network, and turn oilfields into treacle.\n\nMartival Memekeeper Kwathumba Cooroo: When ships using the inchworm drive disappear without trace, Marty discovers that the universe is not only stranger than we think, but bigger than we think. And distinctly more dangerous.\n\nSolman Silvercoin: Alchemage of the ancient city of Obnoghast, tasked by Lord Malvole the Malignant with the lost art of casting a levitation spell. Thanks to the insight of his diminutive ’prentice Jessaphane, the outcome is not what Malvole expects.\n\nIn this anthology of science fiction short stories — several previously unpublished — you will encounter alien invasions, environmental disasters, time-slip mammoths, rogue sensie edits, and quantum life forms that live in stars.\n\nMessage from Earth is an anthology of all my SF short stories that are not available elsewhere. Some originally appeared in Analog, Interzone, and Omni, and I’ve thrown several unpublished ones in as well for good measure. The exceptions are the ‘Billy the Joat’ stories from Analog (which are included in Jack of All Trades), the ‘synte planet’ (Qish) stories with Tim Poston (included in The Living Labyrinth), and my ‘Futures’ stories from Nature and Nature Physics, which can be found free online and are also collected in Pasts, Presents, Futures.\n\nAs a bonus, I’ve also included, as exercises in world-building, the descriptions of four alien worlds and ecosystems that Jack Cohen and I designed in September 2003 for the Science Museum, London.\n\nThe slab bore curious markings, but nothing resembling writing. Hatsutmer could neither recognise what it was, nor of what material it had been made. Not wood, not clay, not metal, not any stone that he could put a name to...\n\nAny simpleton could see what it was not.\n\nWhat it was... even the wisest of men could not say. But he knew what the strange slab exuded. He could feel it, quickening his blood, tugging at his lifesoul.\n\nPower.\n\nIt is North Africa in 17,000 BC. North of the Saltwater Sea, towering cliffs of solid water are melting. A remnant group of Neanderthal lionfaces still survives, pushed south by the ice, along with many prehistoric beasts. They have been subjugated by a pre-Egyptian civilization, the Water People.\n\nA trainee priest finds a strange speaking-stone in the desert, and uses it to become High Priest of the Hippopotamus Cult. His wife Nemnestris is High Priestess of the Followers of Nefteremit the Lilypad Goddess, and together they have the prophecy business sewn up. But Nemnestris has a secret, a past indiscretion whose discovery could destroy them both.\n\nThe lionface Jackalfoot-Snakebite is Beastmaster to the child-King Insh’erthret. The King’s evil uncle, the Regent Sitaperkaw, wants the throne and is willing to do murder to get it. Former warrior Yulmash and his enemy Khuf the Shrewd are getting ready to fight to the death for the gladiatorial Championship, where Jackalfoot’s favourite beast, the sabretoothed lion Sickleface, is certain to be slaughtered. Yulmash’s wife, the Princess Azmyn,\n\nis up to her neck in palace intrigues without realising she is being manipulated. The marriage has failed, and Yulmash is hopelessly enamoured of the lionface herbalist Foxglove-Spearbreaker, but miscegenation is forbidden.\n\nUnknown to any of the Water People — except Bil, the manager of the Arena — criminal pandemons from the far reaches of the Galaxy are covertly recording contests in the arena for their perverted clients, concealed in transparency suits. But when a magnetotorus herd migrating from a distant star arrives in the system, the plasmoids living in the Sun become aware of the pandemon menace, and the pandemon’s stolen Ship decides to subvert its programming and take a hand, it all starts to get complicated...\n\nIngredients\n\nRock Star — a planetless blue giant orbited by hundreds of millions of rocks forming a single vast asteroid field, subtly disobeying human laws of gravity and dynamics. An enigma concealing the greatest threat that humanity has ever encountered.\n\nOld Earth — polluted, damaged, all ice melted, ecosystems slowly dying. Most of its people live in the polar regions, in floating cities, or in undersea domes. Kept alive by external aid, imported down three closely guarded beanstalks.\n\nThe Concordat — a loose-knit federation of former Old Earth colony worlds and their own colonies, wealthy beyond measure. Imposed Quarantine on the birth world of humanity 1700 years ago, denying it access to the stars, except for carefully vetted colonists. Its ultimate power is a monopoly on the means of interstellar travel.\n\nIra da Terra — a person and a liberation movement. Terra-ists will stop at nothing to free Earth from Concordat dominion and repression, and open the path to the Galaxy.\n\nChurch of Cthulhu — surviving in the remnants of drowned Manhattan, waiting for their souls to be eaten when the stars are right.\n\nQish — a lost colony, rediscovered in Living Labyrinth, which has lost most human science but developed tech based on syntei.\n\nSyntei — matter transmitters that grow on trees. Reaching the Concordat, syntelics threaten its very basis … even as it faces the danger from Rock Star.\n\nNazg — a system with twenty-three inhabited worlds and innumerable artificial habitats. Home to Salim Sisters, the Concordat’s most advanced hi-tech corporation.\n\nValkyrie — an obsolete Da Silva caltrop, used to train candidates for Galactic citizenship, twice destroyed. Its impossibly resurrected crew must work with the Syntelic League to save the human race from annihilation.\n\nRecipe\n\nMix thoroughly and simmer over relentlessly increasing heat.\n\npaperback and kindle eBook.\n\nWho were the mysterious PAXIAL? What were the enigmatic prisms that they left on a thousand worlds? Billy the Joat needs to find out, because the PAXIAL prisms are the key to finding his father, who disappeared on a covert mission when the Joat was a child. His taste for practical jokes keeps getting him into trouble with authority; his ability to solve impossible problems for the Quaternity, keeps getting him out of it. His investigations home in on the Etonians, an enormously powerful human family. The quest leads the Joat deep into Sharraby Breach, a forbidden region of distorted space-time... and what he finds there threatens not just his own future, but that of the entire human race.\n\nNew edition of What Shape is a Snowflake?\n\nwith updated text and many new images\n\nThink of a zebra’s stripes, the complexities of a spider’s web, the uniformity of desert dunes, or the spirals in a sunflower head … think of a snowflake. Elegantly illustrated, The Beauty of Numbers in Nature shows how life on Earth follows the principles of mathematics. Each chapter looks at a different kind of patterning system and the mathematics that underlies it.\n\nIn the year 2270 strange wheeled artifacts—wheelers—are found buried beneath the icy surface of Callisto. No one knows what they were used for or who left them there. At the same time, it is discovered that the moons of Jupiter have moved . An expedition finds that Jupiter is inhabited by a race of balloon-like aliens, who defend their world against comet strikes by moving their moons. This time they are aiming an incoming comet directly at Earth! An Earth child with an intuitive understanding of animal behavior becomes the key to contacting them—and joining forces with them to save the world.\n\nSam, Jane, Felix, Elzabet (Lady Elzabet of Quynt), Tinka, and Marco have just been brought together — a mismatched bunch overqualified and highly-skilled trainees from all corners of the Concordat, assembled on a small moon, taking their first steps toward Starhome and qualification as galactic citizens. If they survive. Their first training mission: An extended voyage to the boondocks, out in space where all they can damage is themselves (and a very expensive Da Silva starship). Everything starts out normally, quantum jumping through space-time congruences as the Da Silva drive does... until it's very much not normal, and they find themselves in a very strange place indeed. As they explore, they become aware of a dramatic secret which, if they can report it to the Concordat, will change everything..."
