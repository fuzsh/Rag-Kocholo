        "text": "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\n\nBy Douglas R. Hofstadter,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nThis Pulitzer Prize winner is one of my favorite books. It explores logical paradoxes, the difference between information and meaning, and other almost philosophical issues in the fundamentals of computer science. It links limits to the foundations of mathematics (Gödel) to music (Bach) and the visual arts (Escher). The style is unique, with characters like Achilles and the Tortoise giving an Alice-in-Wonderland feel that illuminates difficult concepts. I first read about it in Martin Gardner’s celebrated column in Scientific American, and it opened my eyes to the relation between math and deep issues in science.\n\nBy Douglas R. Hofstadter,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n14 authors picked Gödel, Escher, Bach as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDouglas Hofstadter's book is concerned directly with the nature of maps\" or links between formal systems. However, according to Hofstadter, the formal system that underlies all mental activity transcends the system that supports it. If life can grow out of the formal chemical substrate of the cell, if consciousness can emerge out of a formal system of firing neurons, then so too will computers attain human intelligence. Goedel, Escher, Bach is a wonderful exploration of fascinating ideas at the heart of cognitive science: meaning, reduction, recursion, and much more.\n\nPreview\n\nDescartes' Dream: The World According to Mathematics (Dover Books on Mathematics)\n\nBy Philip J. Davis, Reuben Hersh,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nMathematicians are constantly baffled by the public’s lack of awareness, not just of what mathematics does, but what it is. Today’s technological society functions only because of a vast range of mathematical concepts, techniques, and discoveries, which go far beyond elementary arithmetic and algebra. This was one of the first books to tackle these misunderstandings head on. It does so by examining not just the math and what it’s used for, but the social structures, the ‘conditions of civilization’ that have brought us to this curious state: utterly dependent on math, almost universally unaware that we are.\n\nBy Philip J. Davis, Reuben Hersh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Descartes' Dream as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"A passionate plea against the use of formal mathematical reasoning as a method for solving mankind's problems. . . . An antidote to the Cartesian view that mathematical and scientific knowledge will suffice to solve the central problems of human existence.\" — The New York Times\n\n\"These cogitations can and should be read by every literate person.\" — Science Books and Films\n\n\"A warning against being seduced or intimidated by mathematics into accepting bad science, bad policies, and bad personal decisions.\" — Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nRationalist philosopher and mathematician René Descartes visualized a world unified by mathematics, in which all intellectual…\n\nPreview\n\nRiddles in Mathematics: A Book of Paradoxes\n\nBy Eugene P. Northrop,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nI was given this book when I was about 15, and devoured it. It is an eclectic collection of mathematical paradoxes, fallacies, and curiosities so strange that they seem impossible. Mathematical magic tricks, a proof that all numbers are equal, a proof that all triangles are isosceles, a curve whose length is infinite but whose area is finite, a curve that crosses itself at every point, a curve that fills the interior of a square. Infinities that are bigger than other infinities. The Saint Petersburg Paradox in probability, a calculation that you should pay the bank an infinite amount of money to play one fair coin-tossing game. The smallest number that cannot be named in fewer than thirteen words (which I’ve just named in twelve words).\n\nBy Eugene P. Northrop,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Riddles in Mathematics as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTwo fathers and two sons leave town. This reduces the population of the town by three. True? Yes, if the trio consists of a father, son, and grandson. This entertaining collection consists of more than 200 such riddles, drawn from every branch of mathematics. Math enthusiasts of all ages will enjoy sharpening their wits with riddles rooted in areas from arithmetic to calculus, covering a wide range of subjects that includes geometry, trigonometry, algebra, concepts of the infinite, probability, and logic. But only an elementary knowledge of mathematics is needed to find amusement in this imaginative collection, which features complete…\n\nPreview\n\nFour Colors Suffice: How the Map Problem Was Solved\n\nBy Robin J. Wilson,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nThe Four Color Problem was one of the most baffling questions in mathematics for over 120 years. First posed in 1852, it asks whether every map can be colored with four colors, or fewer, so that regions adjacent along a boundary have different colors. The answer (yes) was finally obtained in 1976, with massive computer assistance. This method was initially controversial, but the result is now firmly established. This highly readable account, with full-color illustrations, opens up the history and the personalities who tackled this topological enigma, as well as making the mathematics comprehensible. The path to the final solution is littered with blunders and mistakes, but also illustrates how mathematicians can join forces across the generations to chip away at a problem until it cracks wide open.\n\nBy Robin J. Wilson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Four Colors Suffice as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOn October 23, 1852, Professor Augustus De Morgan wrote a letter to a colleague, unaware that he was launching one of the most famous mathematical conundrums in history--one that would confound thousands of puzzlers for more than a century. This is the amazing story of how the \"map problem\" was solved. The problem posed in the letter came from a former student: What is the least possible number of colors needed to fill in any map (real or invented) so that neighboring counties are always colored differently? This deceptively simple question was of minimal interest to cartographers, who saw little…\n\nPreview\n\nWonders Beyond Numbers: A Brief History of All Things Mathematical\n\nBy Johnny Ball,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nOne of the friendliest routes into mathematics, for many people, is its history. In math, unlike many sciences, ideas last indefinitely. Pythagoras’s Theorem is about 4,000 years old, understood in ancient Babylon a thousand years before Pythagoras was born. It was true then, and it is still true today. The history of math tells of the construction of a towering edifice, with each new level built on top of the previous ones. There are many histories of mathematics, but none quite like this one. The author is a much-loved English TV personality, famous for his enthusiasm for math and his ability to make it entertaining for children of all ages. His book is a rollicking yarn, a wild ride that nonetheless remains true to its subject.\n\nBy Johnny Ball,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Wonders Beyond Numbers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this book, Johnny Ball tells one of the most important stories in world history - the story of mathematics.\n\nBy introducing us to the major characters and leading us through many historical twists and turns, Johnny slowly unravels the tale of how humanity built up a knowledge and understanding of shapes, numbers and patterns from ancient times, a story that leads directly to the technological wonderland we live in today. As Galileo said, 'Everything in the universe is written in the language of mathematics', and Wonders Beyond Numbers is your guide to this language.\n\nMathematics is only one part…\n\nPreview\n\nYou might also like...\n\nMindleap: A Fresh View of Education Empowered by Neuroscience and Systems Thinking\n\nBy Jim Brown,\n\nNew book alert!\n\nSponsored by Jim Brown Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have spent my entire professional life quietly patrolling the frontiers of understanding human consciousness. I was an early adopter in the burgeoning field of biofeedback, then neurofeedback and neuroscience, plus theory and practices of humanistic and transpersonal psychology, plus steeping myself in systems theory as a context for all these other fields of focus. I hold a MS in psychology from San Francisco State University and a PhD from Saybrook Institute. I live in Mount Shasta CA with Molly, my life partner for over 60 years. We have two sons and two grandchildren.\n\nJim's book list on brain, mind, and consciousness\n\nWhat is my book about?\n\nIn this thoroughly researched and exquisitely crafted treatise, Jim Brown synthesizes the newest understandings in neuroscience, developmental psychology, and dynamical systems theory for educators and others committed to nurturing human development.\n\nHe explains complex concepts in down-to-earth terms, suggesting how these understandings can transform education to engender optimal learning and intelligence. He explores the nature of consciousness, intelligence, and mind.\n\nBrown then offers a model of optimal human learning through lifelong brain development within a supportive culture--drawing on the work of Piaget, Erickson, Maslow, Kohlberg, and Steiner--and how that work is being vastly expanded by neuroscience and dynamical systems thinking.\n\nMindleap: A Fresh View of Education Empowered by Neuroscience and Systems Thinking\n\nBy Jim Brown,\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this thoroughly-researched and exquisitely crafted treatise, Jim Brown synthesizes the newest understandings in neuroscience, developmental psychology, and dynamical systems theory for educators and others committed to nurturing human development.
