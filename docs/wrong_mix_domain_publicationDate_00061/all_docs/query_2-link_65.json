        "text": "Title: Mathematics and the Imagination\n\nAuthors: Edward Kasner and James Newman\n\nShort Description: A number of chapters covering lots of subjects: counting numbers (including the coining of the word \"googol\"); $\\pi$, $i$, and $e$; geometries, plane and \"fancy\" (\"Lobachevsky's Eiffel Towers and Riemann's Holland Tunnels\"); puzzles; paradoxes; chance and probability; topology (\"rubber sheet geometry\"); calculus. Very much in the spirit of Martin Gardner columns, but from before they existed (the book was originally published in 1940; Gardner began writing his columns in 1956). You can see a preview at Google books.\n\nWhich also leads me to\n\nAuthor: Martin Gardner\n\nTitle: Various\n\nShort Description: A joy to read.\n\nIan Stewart is a very good mathematics popularizer and I understand why many of his books are in this list. But I really don't understand why none of Martin Gardner's books are listed here (at the time I'm writing this).\n\nMy favorite Martin Gardner book (actually, an updated collection of Scientific American Mathematical Games columns) is The Colossal Book of Mathematics. From the book's cover: \"Number Theory, Algebra, Geometry, Probability, Topology, Game Theory, Infinity, and other topics of recreational mathematics.\" I would say its difficulty level is \"+\".\n\nTitle: The Man Who Counted (translated from Portuguese)\n\nAuthor: Malba Tahan\n\nShort description: A mixture of Arabian Nights and a classical puzzlebook. The stories follow a brilliant youth who solves mathematical problems. A highly enjoyable read for anyone who likes oriental tales, and just the right combination of adventures and mathematics for all aunts and nephews out there without a mathematics degree.\n\nMalba Tahan is a pen name of the Brazilian mathematician and writer Júlio César de Mello e Souza. The book was first published as O homem que calculava in 1949.\n\nWonder why it is that nobody has mentioned Lion-Hunting & Other Mathematical Pursuits? That book is one of my all-time favorites.\n\nThe book was edited by Gerald L. Alexanderson, the same individual behind the random walks of G. Pólya. Not only does the book contain the original article that launched the theory of big game hunting as a branch of mathematical research of its own, but also several of the subsequent contributions motivated by that 1938 groundbreaking paper of H. Pétard, e.g.:\n\nIf there is an even number of lions in the Sahara Desert we add a tame lion. Thus we may assume that the group of the Sahara lions is of odd order. This renders the situation capable of solution according to the work of Feit and Thompson.\n\nTitle: Hilbert\n\nAuthor: Constance Reid\n\nDescription: Biography of David Hilbert. Fascinating. Don't have to be D.H. to enjoy it. [the following is added from a duplicate answer - feel free to clean up -- ed.] A beautiful biography of a famous mathematician, showing the passion for knowledge represented by Hilbert and others at Goettingen around 1900. The book has a good description of Hilbert as a person, describes his family and coworkers and (sadly) the decay at the end of Hibert's life as the Nazis took over. I ask some of my undergraduate students to read this so that they can see the excitement of being in our profession. (The book is out of print, I think, but available via half.com or ebay.)\n\nSecond recommendation Also, Time-Life, ca. 1965, published one of it's picture books on math, titled of all things Mathematics (as I recall). Check it out if you can find it. Lots of cool pictures. Great for mathematically inclined high school kids.\n\nNote added in edit: The aforementioned book from the Time-Life series also had great pictures of mathematicians. As I recall, there was one of Eilenberg lying on the couch of his Grenwich Village apartment, coat and tie still on. It was captioned with a quote which went, if I recall correctly, \"Sometimes I like to think riding on the subway, but mostly I like to think lying down.\" Absolutely formative in my personal approach to math!\n\nTitle: The Art of Mathematics\n\nAuthor: B. Bollobas\n\nShort Review: \"The Author considers these problems to be the type that two mathematical friends would pose to each other and discuss over a cup of coffee in a lounge. I agree with that premise, they are not too hard and there is a proof that is relatively easy to discover and even easier to understand. These problems satisfy all of the requirements for a good problem...\"\n\nThis is one of the most entertaining recreation-mathematical books I've ever read. It does require some mathematical knowledge to be fully appreciated though :)\n\nTitle: A tangled tale\n\nAuthor: Lewis Carroll\n\nDescription: (by Carroll himself in the preface) The writer’s intention was to embody in each Knot (like medicine so dexterously, but ineffectually, concealed in the jam of our early childhood) one or more mathematical questions — in Arithmetic, Algebra, or Geometry, as the case might be — for the amusement, and possible edification, of the fair readers of that magazine.\n\nOf course, this will work as a gift for a niece better than a gift for an aunt, but it is one of those few books (the only other ones I know are by Smullyan and they've been mentioned already) that have both an entertaining story line and some actual mathematical challenges for the reader in them and that require no special mathematical training to read and enjoy.\n\nTitle: The Mathematician's Brain\n\nAuthor: David Ruelle\n\nShort description: (++) A book describing how Mathematics are founded, and tries to give a reasoning for the brain-work needed to do math.\n\nFrom Amazon: The Mathematician's Brain poses a provocative question about the world's most brilliant yet eccentric mathematical minds: were they brilliant because of their eccentricities or in spite of them? In this thought-provoking and entertaining book, David Ruelle, the well-known mathematical physicist who helped create chaos theory, gives us a rare insider's account of the celebrated mathematicians he has known-their quirks, oddities, personal tragedies, bad behavior, descents into madness, tragic ends, and the sublime, inexpressible beauty of their most breathtaking mathematical discoveries.\n\nTitle One Two Three . . . Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science\n\nAuthor George Gamow\n\nShort description While not limited to mathematics, this is a great book which presents some subtle mathematical ideas in an intuitive non-technical way. I especially like the presentation of Cantor's infinite cardinality theory, which can be followed by anyone. Unfortunately, there are some mistakes. I seem to recall his presentation implicitly assumes the continuum hypothesis, but maybe he did that for clarity. It doesn't really detract from the book.\n\nI see many favorites here, but this one should be mentioned too:\n\nMR1710978 (2000h:00002) Hugo Steinhaus. Mathematical snapshots. Translated from the Polish. With a preface by Morris Kline. Reprint of the third (1983) English edition. Dover Publications, Inc., Mineola, NY, 1999. vi+311 pp. ISBN: 0-486-40914-7\n\nIt was first published in 1939 (\"Kalejdoskop matematyczny\" in Polish).\n\nHere is the summary:\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=N63XpD1oJ6IC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nThings like fair division or platonic bodies made accessible for an aunt and a niece alike (I actually gave my copy to my niece a few years ago).\n\nTitle: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking: The Formation of Concepts in Modern Mathematics\n\nAuthor: Friedrich Waismann\n\nShort Description: This book, first published in 1936, gives an introduction to the philosophy of mathematics and the foundations of analysis. It shows how to construct number systems, some very elementary set theory and how to make differential calculus precise. The focus is on concepts. It includes a discussion of things like continuuous, nowhere differentiable functions and discusses why R and R2 are isomorphic as sets but not topologically. It even gives an very short and intuitive proof that R and R2 are not homeomorphic.\n\nThe philosophical discussion is, naturally, a litlle bit dated. It discusses formalism, logicism and intuitivism. The philosophy still makes for exciting historical reading. It is clear that this discussion was very lively when this book was written.\n\nThe level should youalify as ++, the book is demanding but can certainly be read before going to college.\n\nTitle: The Mystery of the Aleph: Mathematics, the Kabbalah, and the Search for Infinity\n\nAuthor: Amir D. Aczel\n\nShort Description: Another book about the development of ideas about infinity. The central character is Cantor, of course, but it also looks at people before, like Bolzano and Galileo, and afterwards, including Godel and Cohen for their work on CH.\n\nI read this in high school, having just a little calculus background, and got a lot out of it. It does try to work in the themes of \"contemplation of infinity leads to insanity\" and \"infinity as religious insight\" a bit, which might be drawbacks. But when I read it for the first time, I remember laughing out loud at how amazing the ideas involving infinte cardinalites and AC were, so at least those are presented well.\n\nTitle: Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nAuthor: William Poundstone\n\nShort description (from New York Times Book Review): The real originality of PRISONER'S DILEMMA lies in its colorful synthesis of logical material and historical and biographical narration [which] takes us in parallel lines through cold war history, strategic games of the nuclear age and the life of von Neumann . . . Lively, open and multifaceted.\n\nIndeed, the book can be read as a whole or just by following one of those \"parallel lines\". Depending of the line you choose, the level of difficulty would be + or ++!"
