        "text": "Title: The Science of Discworld III: Darwin’s Watch\n\nAuthor: Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen\n\nType: Fiction/Non-Fiction\n\nPage Count/Review Word Count: 346\n\nRating: 5*/5\n\nI loved, loved, loved this book. I mean, I’ve read the first two books in the Science of Discworld series and I enjoyed them both a lot, but nowhere near as much as this one. I’m not sure if that’s because this book was better than the others or because it came along at just the right time.\n\nHere, we have the usual mixture of fiction and non-fiction in the form of a Discworld story from Terry Pratchett that’s offset by chapters from Stewart and Cohen that delve into the science of both the Discworld and Roundworld, where we live. The title itself references The Blind Watchmaker, a Richard Dawkins book, and there are plenty of references to both Dawkins and Charles Darwin, who appears as a character in Pratchett’s sections.\n\nWhat surprised me here was that I actually enjoyed the non-fiction parts more than the Discworld story that accompanied it. That’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy Pratchett’s contribution, though. It was all fantastic, which is why I didn’t hesitate to give the book a 5/5. I put off reading it for a while purely because it’s a thick old hardback, but in hindsight I think that was a mistake. It’s worth reading whether you’re a Pratchett fan or not, although there are plenty of in-jokes for seasoned fans to enjoy, too.\n\nThe best thing of all is the fact that you don’t have to read the Science of Discworld books in order. Sure, they reference each other, but they’re more like little self-contained releases that act as a beautiful add-on to the Discworld series. I have a horrible feeling that they get overlooked when compared to the rest of Pratchett’s releases, which is a shame. I could name at least a half-dozen Discworld books that weren’t as good as this. So go out and buy it – you won’t regret it.\n\nClick here to buy The Science of Discworld III: Darwin’s Watch.\n\nTitle: The Science of Discworld\n\nAuthor: Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen\n\nType: Fiction/Non-Fiction\n\nPage Count/Review Word Count: 368\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nThe Science of Discworld is an interesting one, because it mixes both fiction and non-fiction, in the form of a series of short stories by Terry Pratchett, as well as a series of essays by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen which explain some of the scientifc principles and concepts which Pratchett adapted for his own nefarious purposes. Because of that, it never gets too heavy – just when you’re starting to tire of the scientific explanations, Ponder Stibbons and the wizards of the Unseen University reappear.\n\nReally, this is probably the closest that Pratchett ever got to writing a Discworld novella, but only if you read all of his shorts back to back. In fact, you can read it any way you want to – personally, I just read it in a linear fashion, because the non-fiction and the fiction do compliment each other if you do that, but you could also read just the fiction, just the science, or read first one and then the other. That gives you, as the reader, a lot of choice!\n\nIt is an interesting enough read, but personally, I would have preferred to have had another Discworld book. Still, if you’re keen to work through Pratchett’s back catalogue, the Science of the Discworld books are well worth reading, and this is the obvious one to begin with. The fact that it was the first to be released means that it covers some of the earlier books in the series, which will appeal to serious aficionados, and it’s also interesting just to see how Pratchett adapted his style to fit the new format.\n\nBut overall, though, I’d only really recommend this if you’re a serious fan of the Discworld series, because it goes in a little deep and you might not want to know about it if you’re only a casual visitor to the Discworld. Personally, I enjoyed it a lot, which is why I read the rest of the science books – but then, I have already devoured all of the novels in Pratchett’s incredible series.\n\nClick here to buy The Science of Discworld."
