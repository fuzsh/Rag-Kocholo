Amazon.Com\n\nThe Alien IQ Test is an irresistibly addictive book for anyone whose juices flow when presented with baffling puzzles, and dizzying array of graphic brainteasers, all devised (if you dare to believe) by aliens who have arrived to assess our intelligence in such far-flung areas of the human mind as abstract reasoning, mathematics, religion, morality, and humanity's concept of beauty.\n\n\"If pop culture (the Hollywood blockbuster Independence Day, hit TV shows like the X-Files and Third Rock from the Sun) is a prophet to be trusted, aliens may soon outnumber humans on this planet. Fortunately... a manual will ease the strain of forced introductions. The strange, symbolic transmissions we've received from outer space (haven't we?) are collected by Clifford Pickover in THE ALIEN IQ TEST: ARE WE UP TO THE CHALLENGE? The problems, puzzles, and questions in this Basic Books title are intended to assess human intelligence -- making this a quiz we simply mustn't fail.\" -- Publisher's Weekly, January 20, 1997, p. 346\n\n\"Clifford Pickover is many things -- scientist, scholar, author, editor, and visionary -- and so it may surprise some that he seems to be embracing the shadowy world of alien visitation and abduction. Yet the man OMNI magazine recently described as \"Van Leeuwenhoek's 20th century equivalent\" has just written a book titled THE ALIEN IQ TEST that is filled, in his own words, with \"strange looking puzzles... from another world -- a world where small gray beings visit us only at night.\" Perhaps in subtle jest, perhaps in utter seriousness, Pickover would have us believe that this illustrated collection of mindbenders came to him in a dream (or was it a dream?), and is a \"universal standard\" by which some extraterrestrial civilization is judging our basic intelligence and capacity for logic. GAMES is pleased to provide an advance sample (direct from a secret government installation, under the tightest security) of the puzzles contained therein, to allow you to test your cosmic awareness.\" - Games magazine, April, 1997, pg 48.\n\nBook's Table of Contents:\n\nPreface\n\nChapter 1.

Watson Research Center, has consistently been one of the most creative writers about computer graphics, scientific visualization, and mathematical models of natural and physical systems. This latest offering is classic Pickover in its wealth of information, ideas, bold speculations and and propositions -- including proposed \"hands-on\" experiments with black holes -- which just may turn out to be plausible. Recommended.\"\n\n- The Editors of Amazon.Com\n\n\"Although the Hubble Space Telescope has recently confirmed the existence of black holes, very little is known about them -- keeping speculation about time travel, wormholes, and the like alive. Pickover provides an amusing tour of the known and unknown regions of black holes by exploring their composition and the possibilities of parallel universes. Indicative of his background in computer science, this is almost an interactive read as Pickover provides a wealth of experiments and computer applications that further the understanding of event horizons, tidal forces, warps, etc.\"\n\n- Science News, May 25, 1996 149(21): 322.\n\n\"Pickover explores the mathematics of the commotion that a black hole creates, from spacewarps to gravitational waves. Simple equations illustrate everything from the mass of a black hole to the curvature of space nearby. Pickover definitely succeeds in giving a feel for the gigantic forces at work. His traveller's guide has interactive, puzzle- book appeal. Anyone remotely interested in numbers will find it hard to resist testing the equations out... No other book has a storyline as bonkers as this one. It's a winner.\"\n\n- \"Space, sex, and sums\", by Hazel Muir, New Scientist, May 25, 1996\n\n\"Bucky Fuller thought big, Arthur C.

Patton, \"Curved Light\", WIRED magazine, June 1996, 4.06 page 130-131.\n\n\"Dr. Pickover, with his usual enthusiasm, wit, and knowledge, accompanied by his familiar superb computer graphics, has turned his attention toward black holes and their bizarre properties. Many books have been written about black holes, but none that surpass this one in arousing emotions of awe and wonder toward the mysterious structure of our universe.\"\n\n- Martin Gardner\n\n\"As one of the thousands who contracted incurable fractaphilia by exposure to the Mandelbrot set, I've much enjoyed Cliff Pickover's earlier books on this infectious disease. Now he has ventured into an even more dangerous territory -- the exploration of Black Holes. All before they set out. However, like Cliff's earlier books, this should carry the warning: 'Reading may be dangerous to your wealth.' It may create an overwhelming impulse to buy a more powerful computer.\"\n\n- Arthur C. Clarke\n\n\"For years writers, artists, and scientists have complained about the division between the sciences and the arts. Some have tried to build bridges across the line, but Clifford Pickover is one of the *very* few who successfully erases the line itself. In *Black Holes: A Traveler's Guide*, Pickover provides a wonderfully illustrated explanation of some of the strangest objects in the universe.

World Scientific. (Fall 1995) ISBN 981-02-1427-8. Amazon.Com\n\nBiological data of all kinds is proliferating at an incredible rate. If humans attempt to read such data in the form of numbers and letters, they will take in the information at a snail's pace. If the information is rendered graphically, however, human analysts can assimilate it and gain insight much faster. The emphasis of this book is on the novel graphical and musical representation of information- containing sequences, such as DNA and amino acid sequences, to help us find hidden pattern and meaning.\n\n\"I must say that this is a fascinating book about a fascinating subject: new ways of representation of symbolic sequences of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, gene mapping) and proteins. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that stores the information (called the genetic code) in organisms as a series (sequences) of 4 bases coded A,T,C and G. This information is written with these \"characters\" forming \"words\" of 3 letters. The words code for specific amino acids which are, in turn, the building parts of proteins. These information blocks are organised into larger functional units called \"genes\". Our genetic code consists of 50000 to 100000 genes of 2 to 2000000 bases each.\n\nCertainly many difficulties arise when all this massive information has to be understood or represented in some way. Visualization techniques originate to overcome these problems and to allow the disclosure and identification of interesting or useful \"patterns\" in the sequences.\n\nThe book consists of the editor's preface and a collection of 15 contributions written in scientific journal style by experts on the subject. There are two impressive colour plates and many black a nd white illustrations and diagrams and all the contributions include a \"glossary\" to clarify some of the scientific terms to the readers The preface is an introduction to visualization, its objectives and examples. It includes about 10 pages of literature references on computational biology, computers and DNA, genetics and music, genetics and fractals, and visualization. There is also a comprehensive list of genetic and biological data repositories with Internet addresses, a list of electronic newsgroups (BIOSCI), a list of USENET newsgroup s addresses, and other Internet resources of interest.\n\nThe chapters deal with a variety of problems such as graphical representations to disclose \"patterns\", whether a sequence is \"random\" or not, taxonomical classifications, how to represent the 3-dimensional structure of proteins in two dimensional space and how to quantify similarities between sequences. Some of the contributions go beyond the description of the algorithms and methods and include computer code. For example \"A Transforming Function for Generation of Fractal Functions from Nucleotide Sequences by J. Campione-Piccardo has a Pascal implementation of his method of barograms. Gene Music: Tonal Assignments of Bases and Amino Acids by N. Mukata and K. Hayashi is a paper describing DNA to musical notes transform that may help to make sequences more comprehensible. Their chap er includes 3 music scores produced from DNA data and a script for \"Hypercard\" and \"HyperMIDI 2.0\" (Macintosh computer). Some of the algorithms to \"visualise\" the sequences are in principle simple and at the same time very powerful; with some computer skills one may be able to reproduce or implement the methods described.\n\nWho is this book for? I think that it will be of interest to a broad range of readers, from biochemists to molecular biologists, computer and computer graphics scientists. It may also appeal to computer enthusiasts as some of the algorithms described may also be applied to other symbolic sequences such as texts or codes. The type of graphic representations shown in the book may not be esthetically as eye catching as so me graphical rendering in the previous titles by Pickover (The Pattern Book or Computers, Pattern, Chaos and Beauty) but we must not forget that the main purpose of the book is to present techniques to make sense out of biological data, while beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n- Dr. Gabriel Landini, Fractal Report\n\n\"Biologists and computer scientists will find treasure in this serious exploration of visualization in molecular biology. Just as scientific computation produces enormous quantities of data that must somehow be grasped by human minds before it can yield fruit, evolution has created huge stores of biological information -- nucleic acid and protein sequences -- that we are just beginning to understand. This book presents many computer graphics tools to help in our search for meaning in the code of life. For the general reader interested in molecular biology, the editor's invaluable and extensive preface provides access not only to the scientific articles that follow but to the rapidly expanding world of biology on the Internet.\" - Dr. Dawn C. S. Friedman, Harvard University\n\n\"With the ongoing improvements in computer visualization techniques, scientists have begun to appreciate the value of visually interpreting their data. Biologists are no exception, and have realized that visual patterns in large amounts of data, such as that generated by the human genome project, are recognized much more readily than numerical patterns. Visualizing Biological Information, edited by Clifford Pickover, is written specifically for biological scientists working with visualization techniques. It concentrates on protein, DNA, and gene and amino acid sequences, and demonstrates how complex data can be reduced to a manageable level. Fifteen bench-mark articles are included. They are written by leading international authorities in wide-ranging areas, and cover themes such as \"graphical representations of amino sequences\" which describes DNA geometry, and \"fractal functions from nucleotide sequences\" which identifies peculiarities in DNA base sequences. There are also articles on the straightforward use of statistics (pattern or cluster analysis, dendrograms, Fourier transforms, principal component analysis, etc) and graphics (ball and stick models) to reduce the detail in data. A memorable sections describes the statistical representation of DNA base sequences using facial symbols. An interesting, philosophical article introduces \"gene music\" -- in which musical notes are assigned to DNA bases to allow audio representation of genetic information. Scales are related to the chemical properties of amino acids, and melody sequences are then recorded in MIDI format. As an example, musical \"scores\" for the drosophila and neurospora gene products are given for the harp and clarinet. The book has a long preface containing extensive reference information. This includes a literature guide and list of organizations, journals, databases, networks, and newsgroups with interest in data visualization. A common theme throughout is the reference to World Wide Web pages, e-mail and server systems that help update scientists on the latest software and data and enable contact between research groups to be maintained. Good use is made of diagrams and figures to illustrate different visualization examples, but rather than being a reference text, the book provides a window on the direction in which work is progressing. The book can also be of some value to other scientists who acquire or access complex data, and wish to consider alternate ways of interpreting their results.\" -Mark Varney, Scientific Computing World, Oct 1996\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nPreface - Clifford A.

The emphasis of this book is on the graphic representation of information-containing sequences such as DNA and amino acid sequences in order to help the human analyst find interesting and biologically relevant patterns. Pickover's goal is to make this voyage through molecular biology, genetics, and computer graphics as accessible to a broad audience as possible, with the inclusion of glossaries at the end of most chapters, and program outlines where applicable. The book will be of most interest to biologists and computer scientists, and the various large reference lists should be of interest to beginners and advanced students of biology, graphic art, and computer science.
