For Ian Stewart, mathematics is far more than dreary arithmetic, while mathematical thinking is one of the most important-and overlooked-aspects of contemporary society. This wide-ranging conversation explores what mathematics is and why it's worth doing, symmetry, networks and patterns, the relationship between logic and proof, the role of beauty in mathematical thinking, the future of mathematics, linking mathematical oscillations to animal gaits, how to deal with the peculiarities of the mathematical community, and much more.\n\nThis carefully-edited book includes an introduction, Counting Sheep, and questions for discussion at the end of each chapter:\nI.
