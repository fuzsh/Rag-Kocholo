        "text": "“A slyly illuminating dispatch on the deep meaning of mathematics. . . . [Cheng] compels us to see numbers and symbols as vivid characters in an ongoing drama, a narrative in which we are alternately observers and participants.”\n\n—Natalie Angier, The American Scholar\n\n“Invoking plenty of examples from cooking and baking, as well as other everyday-life situations such as calculating a taxi fare, searching for love through online dating services and training for a marathon, [Cheng] explains abstract mathematical ideas—including topology and logic—in understandable ways. . . .Her lively, accessible book demonstrates how important and intriguing such a pursuit can be.”\n\n—Scientific American\n\n“A funny and engaging new book.”\n\n—Simon Worrall, National Geographic News\n\n“Why go to all the trouble to write a book to help people understand mathematics? Because, as Cheng observes, ‘understanding is power, and if you help someone understand something, you’re giving them power.’ Read How to Bake Pi and you will, indeed, go away feeling empowered.”\n\n—Marc Merlin, Medium\n\n“In her new book, How to Bake Pi, mathematician/baker Eugenia Cheng offers a novel, mathematical approach to cooking. . . . How to Bake Pi is more than a mathematically minded cookbook. It is just as much a book about mathematical theory and how we learn it. The premise at the heart of the book is that the problem that stops a cookbook from teaching us how to cook is the same problem that makes math classes so bad at actually teaching us to do math.”\n\n—Ria Misra, io9\n\n“[Cheng’s] book, a very gentle introduction to the main ideas of mathematics in general and category theory in particular, exudes enthusiasm for mathematics, teaching, and creative recipes. Category theory is dangerously abstract, but Cheng’s writing is down-to-earth and friendly. She’s the kind of person you’d want to talk to at a party, whether about math, food, music, or just the weather. . . . Cheng’s cheerful, accessible writing and colorful examples make How to Bake Pi an entertaining introduction to the fundamentals of abstract mathematical thinking.”\n\n—Evelyn Lamb, Scientific American’s Roots of Unity blog\n\n“This is the best book imaginable to introduce someone who doesn’t think they are interested in mathematics at all to some of the deep ideas of category theory, especially if they like to bake.”\n\n—MAA Reviews\n\n“Beginning each chapter with a recipe, Cheng converts the making of lasagna, pudding, cookies, and other comestibles into analogies illuminating the mathematical enterprise. Though these culinary analogies teach readers about particular mathematical principles and processes, they ultimately point toward the fundamental character of mathematics as a system of logic, a system presenting daunting difficulties yet offering rare power to make life easier. Despite her zeal for mathematical logic, Cheng recognizes that such logic begins in faith—irrational faith—and ultimately requires poetry and art to complement its findings. A singular humanization of the mathematical project.”\n\n—Booklist, starred review\n\n“Cheng is exceptional at translating the abstract concepts of mathematics into ordinary language, a strength aided by a writing style that showcases the workings of her curious, sometimes whimsical mind. This combination allows her to demystify how mathematicians think and work, and makes her love for mathematics contagious.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly, starred review\n\n“An original book using recipes to explain sophisticated math concepts to students and even the math-phobic. . . . [Cheng] is a gifted teacher. . . . A sharp, witty book to press on students and even the teachers of math teachers.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews\n\n“A well-written, easy-to-read book.”\n\n—Library Journal\n\n“Often entertaining . . . frequently illuminating. . . . [How to Bake Pi] offers enough nourishment for the brain to chew on for a long time.”\n\n—Columbus Dispatch\n\n“Through an enthusiasm for cooking and zest for life, the author, a math professor, provides a new way to think about a field we thought we knew.”\n\n—CEP Magazine\n\n“Combined with infectious enthusiasm for cooking and a zest for life, Cheng’s perspective on math becomes this singular book: a funny, lively, and clear journey no popular book on math has explored before. How to Bake Pi . . . will dazzle, amuse, and enlighten.”\n\n—Gambit Weekly\n\n“This book was fun and covered some cool maths, using some nice analogies, and would serve as a good intro for someone getting into category theory.”\n\n—Aperiodical (UK)\n\n“Eugenia Cheng offers an entertaining introduction to the beauty of mathematics by drawing on insights from the kitchen. She explains why baking a flourless cake is like geometry and offers puzzles to whet the appetites of maths fans.”\n\n—Times Educational Supplement (UK)\n\n“Quirky recipes, personal anecdotes, and a large dollop of equations are the key ingredients in this alternative guide to maths and the scientific process. You should find it as easy as cooking a pie.”\n\n—Observer: Tech Monthly (UK)\n\n“A curious cookbook for the mathematical omnivore.”\n\n—Irish Times (Ireland)\n\n“Eugenia Cheng’s charming new book embeds math in a casing of wry, homespun metaphors: math is like vegan brownies, math is like a subway map, math is like a messy desk. Cheng is at home with math the way you’re at home with brownies, maps, and desks, and by the end of How to Bake Pi, you might be, too.”\n\n—Jordan Ellenberg, professor of mathematics, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and author of How Not to Be Wrong\n\n“With this delightfully surprising book, Eugenia Cheng reveals the hidden beauty of mathematics with passion and simplicity. After reading How to Bake Pi, you won’t look at math (nor porridge!) in the same way ever again.”\n\n—Roberto Trotta, astrophysicist, Imperial College London, and author of The Edge of the Sky\n\n“Math is a lot like cooking. We start with the ingredients we have at hand, try to cook up something tasty, and are sometimes surprised by the results. Does this seem odd? Maybe in school all you got was stale leftovers! Try something better: Eugenia Cheng is not only an excellent mathematician and pastry chef, but a great writer, too.”\n\n—John Baez, professor of math, University of California, Riverside\n\n“From clotted cream to category theory, neither cookery nor math are what you thought they were. But deep down they’re remarkably similar. A brilliant gourmet feast of what math is really about.”\n\n—Ian Stewart, emeritus professor of mathematics, University of Warwick, and author of Visions of Infinity and Professor Stewart’s Incredible Numbers\n\n“This book puts the fun back in math, the fun that I always saw in it, the fun that is nearly sucked from it in K–12 education. . . . I whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone with a casual interest in, or deep love of, logic, or mathematics, or baking.”"
