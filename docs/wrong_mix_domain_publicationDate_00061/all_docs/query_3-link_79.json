        "text": "People who know me do not often see me like this. I supervise PhDs like Dr Dre does albums. Three in a career sounds about right. Here is my 3rd completed, Fangyuan Shen . She has done her own post so I won’t add anything here except to say, I like this photo. We supervised and student-ed at the worst time in human civilisation to do this kind of thing. Here we are, UMIST and new UoM, talking about it.\n\nHere am I at the European Computer and Game Based Learing #ecgbl international serious games competition for 2023 in the pretty campus of University of Twente, where every road is so identically pretty to the next that I took a wrong turn and was well on my way to Germany on the first day. I was presenting my LEGO game for teaching Belbin and Tuckman team theories. I was awarded First Runner-up in the ‘non-digital’ category. My thanks to judges BT Professor Sara de Freitas and Guido Brunisma for seeing that a little #lego object of 30 pieces in a used Chinese-takeaway container can be as much of a serious game and learning experience as some of the exquisitely produced and packaged board games I was up against. Prime example of which, was the category winner ‘Biodiversity in Schools’ from the I-Shou University National Museum of Natural Science, Taiwan. Also, as a judge myself of the ‘student games’ category, it was a delight to see my winners, the delightfully enthusiastic and well-prepared teens from Man Kwan Pak Kau College, Hong Kong and their English Language Teaching game ‘Roaring’ go into the Grand Final.\n\nThis adds further imperative to the need to come away from reports, essay and exams (I recently put revision advice that I gave to a class into Chat GPT and its passed the exam that I set) and have some innovation in assessment strategies. I am particularly interested in experiential learning and assessment where there can be indeterminism and value that emerge from the nature of the 'doing', or uniqueness that arises from relationships built into the work, such as (in my experience) students co-creating assessed artefacts with project practitioners.\n\nHere is a new article by me and Kun Wang for the Association for Project Management (APM) 'Is AI the Terminator of Project Management Professionalisation?' It furthers our perspective that the consideration of the long-term implications for the status of PM professionalisation are missing from the current talk centring around digitalisation of PM tasks/techniques. I feel its a lot more fluent than I was on the Festival Panel yesterday! I'm sure I have the editor Annie Mizra to thank for this. #ai #projectmanagement #professional #professionals #projects #projectmanager https://lnkd.in/gDGggB2r\n\nOn Wednesday 8th Feb I'll be a panelist along with Dr Jo Jolly, Head of Project Futures IPA and Karlene Agard, Oxford Global Projects at the APM Festival of Education and Research on the subject of 'How will AI and digitalisation impact on the role and requirements of the future project profession?' I'll be talking about my APM-funded research with Dr Kun Wang into the impact of AI on the projects profession. We look at project management not simply a set of tasks to deliver the iron triangle, but as the meaningful work of people, a desirable professional identity and a nexus of exchange relationships. Our findings are based on what project professionals themselves think about what separates them from those who merely manage occasional projects and how the capabilities of AI, as they understand them, might enhance, modify or render obsolete the exchanges and traits that act as basis for the status of the profession and their claims to professional status as individuals. https://lnkd.in/eCxZ2EFA #ai #education #people #future #research #projectmanagement #projects #work #project\n\nThere are a lot of 'lasts' here. This is the last photo of the MSc Management of Projects class of 21-22 (33% of it, I’m at the front). This is the last MoP class photo to be taken on Pariser Lawn and one of the last photos to be taken on the UMIST North Campus as we are all leaving for the MECD on South Campus. Finally, its my last photo as a Programme Director on MSc MoP. Since 2006 (shout out to my BSc ICT guys), I have been a director of some kind of academic programme. Now, no longer. I am leaving MoP in the capable hands of a new Director as I go on academic leave. I am not leaving UoM, just taking a sabbatical. It a sad fact, as I've gotten into my late 40s, my sense of adventure has declined rapidly. But why did I need to travel when my job brought the world to me? This is something I'll miss. Every year cohort brought me something new, taught me something new. I've loved them all. It's going to be strange not having a few hundred more new lives cross into mine in 22-23."
