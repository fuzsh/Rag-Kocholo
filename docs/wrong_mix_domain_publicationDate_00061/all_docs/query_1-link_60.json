In the meantime, just send us an email at breakingmathpodcast@gmail.com and we’ll send you a transcript.\n\nOpen AI’s release of SORA has left many discussing the concept of Physics-informed Machine Learning. Specifically, how much physics of the real world can machine learning ‘learn’ (it is indeed strange to use that term) or demonstrate an understanding of similar to what OpenAi’s SORA has shown thus far.\n\nThere are currently fascinating debates and discussions happening on X (Twitter) among subject-matter experts in the field (see here https://x.com/drjimfan/status/1758549500585808071?s=61 and here https://x.com/nandodf/status/1759148460526219383?s=61.\n\nIn this multi-part series, we will be discussing how much physics SORA can (has?) learned, understood, and can use in a useful way for human users as well as research into other “Physics-Informed Machine Learning” approaches. We will be relying heavily upon the wonderful work of Dr. Steven Brunton, “@EigenSteve” on social media, who recently released this video on YouTube on an over-view of physics informed machine-learning.\n\nStay tuned! We will be going over a lot on this very important topic!\n\nMatter is that which takes up space, and has mass. It is what we interact with, and what we are. Imagining a world without matter is to imagine light particles drifting aimlessly in space. Gasses, liquids, solids, and plasmas are all states of matter. Material science studies all of these, and their combinations and intricacies, found in examining foams, gels, meshes, and other materials and metamaterials. Chris Cogswell is a material scientist, and host of The Mad Scientist Podcast, a podcast that takes a critical look at things ranging from technological fads, to pseudoscience, and topics that deserve a critical eye. On the first of a pair of two episodes about material science, we interview Chris about his experience with studying material science, and ask questions about the subject in general.\n\nLinks referenced by Chris Cogswell:\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUvi5eQhPTc is about nanomagnetism and cool demonstration of ferrofluid\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dlt63N-Uuk goes over nanomagnetic applications in medicine\n\n- http://yaghi.berkeley.edu/pdfPublications/04MOFs.pdf Great review paper on new class of materials known as MOFs which are going to be very important in coming years\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkYimZBzguw Crash course engineering on nanomaterials, really good introduction to the field\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7EYQLOlwDM Oak Ridge national lab paper on using nano materials for carbon dioxide conversion to other carbon molecules\n\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxVFopLpIQY Really good paper on carbon capture technology challenges and economics\n\n[Featuring: Sofía Baca, Gabriel Hesch, Meryl Flaherty; Chris Cogswell]\n\nSeldom do we think about self-reference, but it is a huge part of the world we live in. Every time that we say 'myself', for instance, we are engaging in self-reference. Long ago, the Liar Paradox and the Golden Ratio were among the first formal examples of self-reference. Freedom to refer to the self has given us fruitful results in mathematics and technology. Recursion, for example, is used in algorithms such as PageRank, which is one of the primary algorithms in Google's search engine. Elements of self-reference can also be found in foundational shifts in the way we understand mathematics, and has propelled our understanding of mathematics forward. Forming modern set theory was only possible due to a paradox called Russel's paradox, for example. Even humor uses self-reference. Realizing this, can we find harmony in self-reference? Even in a podcast intro, are there elements of self-reference? Nobody knows, but I'd check if I were you. Catch all of this, and more, on this episode of Breaking Math. Episode 70.1: Episode Seventy Point One of Breaking Math Podcast\n\n[Featuring: Sofía Baca, Gabriel Hesch; Millicent Oriana]\n\nHello, listeners! This is Sofia with an announcement.\n\nSeason 4 is about to start, and we have some great episodes planned. The last few weeks have been busy for us in our personal lives, and we apologize for our spotty release schedule lately. We're excited to bring you more of the content you've grown to love.\n\nToday, we're going to have a rerun of our first episode on. This episode is a little rough at points, but we're choosing to rerun it because it captures the spirit of the podcast so elegantly. So, without further ado, here is Breaking Math episode 1: Forbidden Formulas.\n\n[Featuring: Sofía Baca, Gabriel Hesch; Amy Lynn]\n\nMichael Brooks is a science writer who specializes in making difficult concepts easier to grasp. In his latest book, Brooks goes through several mathematical concepts and discusses their motivation, history, and discovery. So how do stories make it easier to learn? What are some of the challenges associated with conveying difficult concepts to the general public? And who, historically, has been a mathematician? All of this and more on this episode of Breaking Math. Songs were Breaking Math Intro and Outro by Elliot Smith of Albuquerque.

From its roots in death statistics, insurance, and gambling to modern Bayesian networks and machine learning, we've seen immense productivity in this field. Every way of looking at probability has something in common: the use of random variables. Random variables let us talk about events with uncertain outcomes in a concrete way. So what are random variables? How are they defined? And how do they interact?

It should be, then, no surprise that sometimes mathematics is used for evil; that is to say, there are times where mathematics is used to either implement or justify regressive things like greed, racism, classism, and even genocide. So when has math been used for destructive purposes? What makes us mis-apply mathematics? And why can oversimplification lead to devastation?

She was always faced with the difficult task of convincing people who had stakes in things that would be affected by acknowledging the information in her report. In her newest book, “Saving Us: A Climate Scientist’s Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World”, she discusses the challenges associated with these conversations, at both the micro and macro level. So who is Katherine Heyhoe? How has she learned to get people to acknowledge the reality of climate science? And is she the best, or worst, person to strike up a discussion about how the weather’s been? All of this, and more, on this episode of Breaking Math.

The world also happens to be spherical, which can make getting to those things a challenge if you don't have many landmarks. This is the case when people are navigating by sea. For this reason, map projections, which take a sphere and attempt to flatten it onto a sheet, were born. So what is a map projection? Why are there so many? And why is Gall-Peters the worst? All of this, and more, on this episode of Breaking Math.\n\nTheme was written by Elliot Smith.\n\nThis episode is distributed under a Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution-ShareAlike-NonCommercial International License.

The concept of voicing an opinion to be, hopefully, considered fairly is as ancient and well-established as the human concept of society in general. But, as time goes on, the recent massive influx of voting systems in the last 150 years have shown us that there are as many ways to vote as there are flaws in the way that the vote is tallied. So what problems exist with voting? Are there any intrinsic weaknesses in group decision-making systems? And what can we learn by examining these systems?

John Fuisz is someone who works with this science, and has experience improving the accuracy of forecasting. So how can forecasting be analyzed? What type of events are predictable? And why might Russia think a Missouri senator's race hinges upon North Korea? All of this and more on this episode of Breaking Math.\n\nThe theme for this episode was written by Elliot Smith.\n\n[Featuring: Sofía Baca, Gabriel Hesch; John Fuisz]\n\nThis is a rerun of one of our favorite episodes while we change our studio around.\n\nGame theory is all about decision-making and how it is impacted by choice of strategy, and a strategy is a decision that is influenced not only by the choice of the decision-maker, but one or more similar decision makers. This episode will give an idea of the type of problem-solving that is used in game theory. So what is strict dominance? How can it help us solve some games? And why are The Obnoxious Seven wanted by the police?\n\nDistributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

A huge part of nature is the idea of things like networks. These are represented by mathematical objects called 'graphs'. Graphs allow us to describe a huge variety of things, such as: the food chain, lineage, plumbing networks, electrical grids, and even friendships. So where did this concept come from? What tools can we use to analyze graphs? And how can you use graph theory to minimize highway tolls?

This deceptively simple formula, discovered by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1843, led to a revolution in the way 19th century mathematicians and scientists thought about vectors and rotation. This formula, which extends the complex numbers, allows us to talk about certain three-dimensional problems with more ease. So what are quaternions? Where are they still used? And what is inscribed on Broom Bridge? All of this and more on this episode of Breaking Math.\n\nThis episode is distributed under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

For example, if we take a slip of paper and glue it to itself, we can get a ring. If we turn it a half turn before gluing it to itself, we get what's called a Möbius strip, which has only one side twice the length of the paper. If we glue the edges of the Möbius strip to each other, and make a tube, you'll run into trouble in three dimensions, because the object that this would make is called a Klein flask, and can only exist in four dimensions. So what is a fiber? What can fiber bundles teach us about higher dimensional objects?\n\nAll of this, and more, on this episode of Breaking Math.\n\n[Featuring: Sofía Baca, Meryl Flaherty]\n\nIn introductory geometry classes, many of the objects dealt with can be considered 'elementary' in nature; things like tetrahedrons, spheres, cylinders, planes, triangles, lines, and other such concepts are common in these classes. However, we often have the need to describe more complex objects. These objects can often be quite organic, or even abstract in shape, and include things like spirals, flowery shapes, and other curved surfaces. These are often described better by differential geometry as opposed to the more elementary classical geometry. One helpful metric in describing these objects is how they are curved around a certain point. So how is curvature defined mathematically? What is the difference between negative and positive curvature? And what can Gauss' Theorema Egregium teach us about eating pizza?\n\nThis episode distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

The tools that are being used in this field are constantly being honed and reevaluated as our understanding of the brain and mind increase. And it's no surprise: the brain is responsible for the way we interact with the world, and the idea that ideas hone one another is not new to anyone who possesses a mind. But how can the tools that we use to study the brain and the mind be linked? How do the mind and the brain encode one another? And what does Bayes have to do with this?

They can also be defined as objects which have a boundary that is uniformly distant from some point, using some definition of distance. Circles and spheres were integral to the study of mathematics at least from the days of Euclid, being the objects generated by tracing the ends of idealized compasses. However, these objects have many wonderful and often surprising mathematical properties. To this point, a circle's circumference divided by its diameter is the mathematical constant pi, which has been a topic of fascination for mathematicians for as long as circles have been considered.\n\n[Featuring Sofía Baca; Meryl Flaherty]\n\nWays to support the show:\n\n-Visit our Sponsors:\n\ntheGreatCoursesPlus.com/breakingmath Get a free month of the Great Courses Plus while supporting this show by clicking the link and signing up!\n\nbrilliant.org/breakingmath Sign up at brilliant.org, where breaking math listeners get a 20% off of a year's subscription of Brilliant Premium!\n\nPatreon Become a monthly supporter at patreon.com/breakingmath\n\nMerchandise\n\nPurchase a Math Poster on Tensor Calculus at our facebook store at facebook.com/breakingmathpodcast\n\nA numerical base is a system of representing numbers using a sequence of symbols. However, like any mathematical concept, it can be extended and re-imagined in many different forms. A term used occasionally in mathematics is the term 'exotic', which just means 'different than usual in an odd or quirky way'. In this episode we are covering exotic bases. We will start with something very familiar (viz., decimal points) as a continuation of our previous episode, and then progress to the more odd, such as non-integer and complex bases. So how can the base systems we covered last time be extended to represent fractional numbers? How can fractional numbers be used as a base for integers? And what is pi plus e times i in base i + 1?\n\nThis episode is distributed under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

A little later, people wrote numbers down by chunking the number in a similar way into larger numbers: there were symbols for ten, ten times that, and so forth, for example, in ancient Egypt; and we are all familiar with the Is, Vs, Xs, Ls, Cs, and Ds, at least, of Roman numerals. However, over time, several peoples, including the Inuit, Indians, Sumerians, and Mayans, had figured out how to chunk numbers indefinitely, and make numbers to count seemingly uncountable quantities using the mind, and write them down in a few easily mastered motions. These are known as place-value systems, and the study of bases has its root in them: talking about bases helps us talk about what is happening when we use these magical symbols.\n\nMachines have been used to simplify labor since time immemorial, and simplify thought in the last few hundred years. We are at a point now where we have the electronic computer to aid us in our endeavor, which allows us to build hypothetical thinking machines by simply writing their blueprints — namely, the code that represents their function — in a general way that can be easily reproduced by others. This has given rise to an astonishing array of techniques used to process data, and in recent years, much focus has been given to methods that are used to answer questions where the question or answer is not always black and white. So what is machine learning? What problems can it be used to solve? And what strategies are used in developing novel approaches to machine learning problems?

Many listening to this, for example, have lived through the rise of smart phones, 3d printing, massive advancements in lithium ion batteries, the Internet, robotics, and some have even lived through the introduction of cable TV, color television, and computers as an appliance. All advances in machinery, however, since the beginning of time have one thing in common: they make what we want to do easier. One of the great tragedies of being imperfect entities, however, is that we make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes can lead to war, famine, blood feuds, miscalculation, the punishment of the innocent, and other terrible things. It has, thus, been the goal of many, for a very long time, to come up with a system for not making these mistakes in the first place: a thinking machine, which would help eliminate bias in situations. Such a fantastic machine is looking like it's becoming closer and closer to reality, especially with the advancements in artificial intelligence. But what are the origins of this fantasy? What attempts have people made over time to encapsulate reason? And what is ultimately possible with the automated manipulation of meaning? All of this and more on this episode of Breaking Math.

Roughly, the arrow of time is the same as the arrow of causality. However, what happens when that is not the case? It is so often the case in our experience that this possibility brings not only scientific and mathematic, but ontological difficulties. So what is retrocausality? What are closed timelike curves? And how does this all relate to entanglement?\n\nThis episode is distributed under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

This sense of freedom, for many, seems so intrinsic to our way of seeing the universe that it seems as though such an idea would only beget horror in the human mind. And black holes, being objects from which not even light can escape, for many do beget that same existential horror. But these objects are not exotic: they form regularly in our universe, and their role in the intricate web of existence that is our universe is as valid as the laws that result in our own humanity. So what are black holes? How can they have information? And how does this relate to the edge of the universe?\n\n[Featuring: Sofía Baca, Gabriel Hesch]\n\nSince time immemorial, blacksmiths have known that the hotter metal gets, the more it glows: it starts out red, then gets yellower, and then eventually white. In 1900, Max Planck discovered the relationship between an ideal object's radiation of light and its temperature. A hundred and twenty years later, we're using the consequences of this discovery for many things, including (indirectly) LED TVs, but perhaps one of the most dangerously neglected (or at least ignored) applications of this theory is in climate science. So what is the greenhouse effect? How does blackbody radiation help us design factories? And what are the problems with this model?\n\nThis episode is distributed under a CC BY-SA license.

This may be because the history of statistics starts in a sort of humdrum way: collecting information on the population for use by the state. However, it has blossomed into a beautiful field with its fundamental roots in measure theory, and with some very interesting properties. So what is statistics? What is Bayes' theorem?
