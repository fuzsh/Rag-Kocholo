        "text": "Prizes for the year’s best books in mathematics were awarded to me and to Tim Chartier by the Mathematical Association of America on 5 January 2017 in Atlanta.\n\nI received the MAA Euler Book Prize, given to an author of an outstanding book about mathematics, for In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations That Changed the World.\n\nChartier was honored with the MAA Beckenbach Book Prize, recognising the author of a distinguished, innovative book published by MAA Press, for When Life is Linear: From Computer Graphics to Bracketology.\n\nOn 28 August 2016 I was presented with the Bloody Stupid Johnson Award for Innovative Uses of Mathematics, at the Gala Dinner of the 2016 Discworld Convention at the Chesford Grange, Kenilworth.\n\nBloody Stupid Johnson is Discworld's analogue of Capability Brown—without the capability. His inch-high Collossus of Morpork is typical of his work.\n\nAn up-to-the-minute guide to the cosmos. Describes the architecture of space and time, dark matter and dark energy, how galaxies, stars and planets form, why stars implode, how everything began, and how it’s all going to end. Parallel universes, fine-tuning of the cosmos for life, what forms alien life might take, and the likelihood of life on Earth being snuffed out by an asteroid. Explains the fundamentals of gravity, relativity, quantum theory, and how they relate to each other—including the problems many cosmologists prefer not to tell you about.\n\nChance, the latest New Scientist collection from Profile Books, is now in print. Two of my articles are included: one on randomness, and the other (with Jack Cohen) on coincidences. A painless introduction to probability theory and its uses, as well as the deeper philosophical aspects of uncertainty.\n\nUninhabitable Zone\n\nMy latest SF short story, in Nature's 'Futures' section. Read it here free. You can read all the others too.\n\nI’ve never been comfortable with the idea that Earth is the perfect habitat for life, that it may be the only inhabited planet in a universe with gazillions of planets, not to mention exomoons, that life must be based on water, carbon, DNA and proteins, and that the only places where life could possibly occur are planets orbiting in the ‘habitable zone’ of a main sequence star.\n\nLife adapts to its environment, so what’s needed is an environment that allows sufficiently complex processes to occur.\n\nAstrobiologists call cold-loving organisms extremophiles. I hate that word. It assumes we’re normal and everything else is extreme. It lumps bacteria that live under ice in the Antarctic with ones that live in boiling pools in Yellowstone Park, for heaven’s sake. To the Yellowstone bacteria, we are extremophiles.\n\nIncredible Numbers iPad app listed among Best Apps for Teaching and Learning 2015 by American Association of School Librarians. They say:\n\nProfessor Ian Stewart guides students through an amazing variety of mathematical concepts and topics. Included are 23 articles and 71 interactive demonstrations that bring mathematics to life. Students will learn about fascinating topics such as breaking codes, the mystery of Pi, and how numbers work in nature.\n\nTip: Use Incredible Numbers to enrich math learning as students work to complete on of Professor Ian Stewart's famous puzzles.\n\nA new 4th edition of Galois Theory is now available, in both book and kindle eBook formats. This edition is an updated and slightly extended version of the 3rd edition. All known errors are corrected and several proofs are improved. The main changes are:\n\n• Proof of Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is based on real analysis\n\n• Ruler-and-compass constructions are analysed by identifying the Euclidean plane with the complex numbers\n\n• Recent advances on Euclidean quadratic fields\n\n• New chapter revisits the history to discuss what Galois actually proved, and what he might have known about the simple group A5"
