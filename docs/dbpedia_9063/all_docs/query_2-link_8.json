        "text": "Charles Hardin Holley, known throughout the world as \"Buddy Holly,\" was born and raised in Lubbock, Texas. His musical interests were formed during his early childhood and by the time he was in high school, he had organized a group known as the Western and Bop Band. In 1955, Buddy's group appeared as the opening act for a show headed by Marty Robbins and the then-unknown Elvis Presley. Buddy's act was so impressive that he secured his first (short-term) recording contract.\n\nShortly afterward, Buddy recorded several demo tapes for Norman Petty. Under his aegis, Buddy and the rockabilly group known as The Crickets recorded \"That'll Be the Day,\" which zoomed to the Billboard No. 1 spot. Two solo hits for Buddy soon followed: \"Peggy Sue\" and \"Rave On.\" Between 1957 and ’58, Buddy produced seven Top 40 Hits. Critics identified his jangling guitar and brand of rock as Tex-Mex. \"Oh Boy,\" “Maybe Baby,\" \"It's So Easy,\" \"Think it Over,\" “Everyday,” “Words of Love,” “Not Fade Away\" and \"True Love Ways\" are still heard today. Linda Ronstadt, Mickey Gilley, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles have all recorded Holly's songs. Paul McCartney has acknowledged Holly’s innovative style and immense versatility as a great influence in his own creative output.\n\nBuddy Holly can truly be said to have changed the face of Rock 'n Roll. A long, lanky body, a childish smile, horn-rimmed glasses and a plain, folksy quality became a part of his unique image-and this was in an era of pretty-boy teen idols. He employed the now-classic style of two guitars, bass and drums lineup in his recordings, which is still utilized today.\n\nIt has been written that Buddy Holly had more originality and drive at age nineteen than most rock groups ever summon up in their entire careers. His work continues to live on, influencing generation after generation."
