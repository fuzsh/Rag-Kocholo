        "text": "Charles Hardin “Buddy” Holley was born in Lubbock on September 7, 1936, to Ella Pauline (Drake) and Lawrence Odell “L.O.” Holley. The youngest of four children, Buddy grew up in a musical household, with his mother and siblings singing and playing instruments. Buddy showed musical aptitude, taking violin, piano and steel guitar lessons. He took up the acoustic guitar after his brother, Travis, bought a $15 Harmony model.\n\nBuddy, with other young Lubbock “pickers,” formed several country groups. In 1955, he saw Elvis Presley in concert and was impressed by Presley’s rhythm and performance style. Buddy and his friends were opening for big country acts at the Fair Park Coliseum when Eddie Crandall, an agent and manager, saw a performance and helped Buddy broker a Decca recording contract. Buddy’s last name was misspelled on the contract: “Holley” became “Holly.” Buddy’s relationship with Decca was short-lived as his early recording sessions failed to produce a hit.\n\nIn 1957, Buddy and his new band, The Crickets, began working with producer Norman Petty in Clovis, New Mexico. On February 25, 1957, they recorded “That’ll Be The Day,” the first of several hits on the Brunswick label. Their success led the band to tour widely in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 1958, Buddy Holly and the Crickets toured England. The group had a profound influence on rock and roll in England – from their sound to Buddy’s distinct look. On February 3, 1959, during a three-week tour of the Midwestern United States, Buddy’s chartered plane crashed after takeoff due to bad weather. There were no survivors. Buddy Holly was 22 years old."
