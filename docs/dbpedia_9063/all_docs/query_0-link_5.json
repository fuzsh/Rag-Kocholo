        "text": "Remembering the Legend of Buddy Holly  Every Song Now in Stereo!\n\nIts hard to believe that its been more than 63 years since Buddy Holly left us on that tragic flight, but during a mere four years of recording, he built a legacy with more memorable classics than many artists create in a full lifetime. Youll hear all his most important songs in this collection, with his 1950s recordings sounding better than ever before in brilliant STEREO, many for the first time! From Peggy Sue to It Doesnt Matter Anymore, Buddy takes you through pop, rockabilly, early rock n roll and country for the definitive STEREO Holly experience, all packed into one amazing CD. Featuring 17 STEREO DEBUTS. Includes a 12-page booklet with an essay by Fred Bronson.\n\nCheck out the sound samples below (on your best system). You wont find these EXCLUSIVE stereo gems online!"
