        "text": "Cataloguing of published recordings by Buddy Holly\n\nStudio albums3Compilation albums29Singles28\n\nBuddy Holly recorded under several names and with several different backing bands. The Crickets played on almost all of his singles in 1957 and 1958.[1]\n\nHolly recorded prolifically before his death in a plane crash on February 3, 1959. He released three albums in his lifetime. Coral Records was able to release archival new albums and singles for 10 years after his death, but their technical quality was mixed, some being studio recordings and others home recordings.\n\nHolly's records were promoted after his death and had a loyal following, especially in Europe. The demand for unissued recordings by Holly was so great that his producer, Norman Petty, resorted to overdubbing whatever he could find: alternate takes of studio recordings, originally rejected masters, \"Crying, Waiting, Hoping\" and the other five 1959 tracks (adding new surf-guitar arrangements), and even Holly's amateur demos from 1954 (in which the low-fidelity vocals are often muffled behind added orchestrations). The last new Holly album was Giant (featuring the single \"Love Is Strange\"), issued in 1969. Between the 1959–1960 overdubs produced by Jack Hansen (with vocal backings imitating the Crickets' sound), the 1960s overdubs produced by Petty, various alternate takes, and Holly's undubbed originals, multiple versions of the same songs are available. There are also many different versions of Holly's Greatest Hits as well as covers and compilation albums of his songs performed by various artists. Many singles and albums of his material have been released posthumously, beginning with \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" in July 1959 and the successful 6-disc collectors box set Not Fade Away: The Complete Studio Recordings, 50 years later in 2009.\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Artist Album details Peak chart\n\npositions UK\n\n[2][3] 1957 The \"Chirping\" Crickets The Crickets\n\nReleased: November 1957\n\nLabel: Brunswick (BL 54038) (mono)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n5 1958 Buddy Holly Buddy Holly\n\nReleased: March 1958\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 57210) (mono)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— That'll Be the Day Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes\n\nReleased: April 1958\n\nLabel: Decca (DL 8707) (mono)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n5 \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nDecade Title Album details Peak chart positions Certifications US\n\n[4] NZ\n\n[5] UK\n\n[2][3] 1950s The Buddy Holly Story\n\nReleased: February 28, 1959\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 57279) (mono)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n11 — 2 US: Gold[6] 1960s The Buddy Holly Story, Vol. 2\n\nReleased: April 1960\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 57326) (mono)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n41\n\n[7] — 7 Reminiscing\n\nReleased: February 1963\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 57426/757426) (mono/stereo)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n40 — 2 Showcase\n\nReleased: May 1964\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 57450/757450) (mono/stereo)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — 3 Holly in the Hills\n\nReleased: January 1965\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 57463/757463) (mono/stereo)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — 13 The Best of Buddy Holly\n\nReleased: April 1966\n\nLabel: Coral (CXB-8, mono)/(7CXSB-8, stereo)\n\nFormat: Vinyl (2 LPs)\n\n— — — UK: Gold[8] Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits\n\nReleased: March 1967\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 57492/757492) (mono/stereo)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — 9 Giant\n\nReleased: March 1969\n\nLabel: Coral (CRL 757504) (stereo)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — 13 1970s Buddy Holly: A Rock & Roll Collection\n\nReleased: August 1972\n\nLabel: Decca (DSXE7-207) (stereo)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — — Buddy Holly: Legend\n\nReleased: 1974\n\nLabel: MCA\n\nFormat: Vinyl (2 LPs)\n\nTBD TBD TBD 20 Golden Greats\n\nalso known as Buddy Holly Lives\n\nReleased: February 17, 1978\n\nLabel: EMI (EMTV 8)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n55 — 1 US: Gold[6]\n\nUK: Platinum[8] The Complete Buddy Holly\n\nReleased: 1979\n\nLabel: MCA (6-80000)\n\nFormat: Vinyl (box set)\n\n— — — 1980s Love Songs\n\n20 Love Song (US title)\n\nReleased: 1981\n\nLabel: MCA\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — — UK: Gold[8] The Great Buddy Holly\n\nReleased: November 1982\n\nLabel: MCA (31037)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — — For the First Time Anywhere\n\nReleased: February 1983\n\nLabel: MCA (MCA-27059)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— — — From the Original Master Tapes\n\nReleased: 1985\n\nLabel: MCA (MCAD-5540)\n\nFormat: CD\n\n— — — True Love Ways\n\nReleased: February 1989\n\nLabel: Telstar (STAR 2339)\n\nFormat: Vinyl\n\n— 24 8 UK: Gold[8] 1990s Words of Love\n\nReleased: February 8, 1993\n\nLabel: PolyGram (TV 5144872)\n\nFormat: CD\n\n— 20 1 UK: Gold[8] The Buddy Holly Collection\n\nReleased: September 28, 1993\n\nLabel: MCA (B000002OPE)\n\nFormat: CD (2 discs)\n\n— — — Greatest Hits\n\nReleased: September 24, 1996\n\nLabel: MCA (MCAD-11536)\n\nFormat: CD\n\n— — — The Very Best of Buddy Holly\n\nReleased: November 25, 1996\n\nLabel: Dino (DINCD 133)\n\nFormat: CD\n\n— — 24 UK: Gold[8] 20th Century Masters -
