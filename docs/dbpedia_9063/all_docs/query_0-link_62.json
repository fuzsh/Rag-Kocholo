Not Fade Away\n6. I&#39;m Gonna Love You Too\n7. Oh Boy!\n8. Rave On\n9. Maybe Baby\n10. Crying, Waiting, Hoping\n\nBack in 2017, I visited the Norman Petty Recording Studio in Clovis NM where Buddy Holly (among many others) recorded a majority of his catalog. I didn&#39;t know what to expect, but upon entering I was nearly brought to gleeful tears. \r\n\r\nFast forward a little while when I head Buddy Holly by Weezer on the radio. I wondered it Weezer ever actually covered a Buddy Holly song. Turns out they never have, so I thought I&#39;d record a bunch of Buddy Holly songs in the style of Weezer. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
