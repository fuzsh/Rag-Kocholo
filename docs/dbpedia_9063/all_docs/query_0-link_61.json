        "text": "Birth of Buddy Holly\n\nThe fourth and youngest child in his family, Holly’s mother called him “Buddy” from an early age. He learned to play piano, fiddle, and guitar very young and his parents supported his musical ambitions.\n\nClick any of these images to order additional conditions and covers for your collection.\n\nHolly was initially influenced by the likes of Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family and had his beginnings as a country artist. After high school, Holly created a country western band and frequently had his songs played on the local radio station. Playing in small clubs in the Southwest, he gained a local following and was soon signed on by Decca records as a country singer."
