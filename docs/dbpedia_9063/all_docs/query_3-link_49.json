        "text": "… Long long time ago, I can still remember\n\nHow that music used to make me smile\n\nAs a child\n\nI was raised\n\nOn Rock n Roll\n\nThanks to my parents\n\nMy Dad in particular\n\nThe songs I know\n\nBy heart\n\nThe songs I love\n\nTo listen to\n\nOver and over again\n\nAre from the 50s & 60s\n\nOne of my most\n\nFavourite singers of all time\n\nIs Buddy Holly\n\nWe used to listen\n\nTo his music\n\nAt home\n\nIn the car\n\nOn holiday\n\nMany of my childhood\n\nTeenage and adult memories\n\nAre tied up with\n\nBuddy Holly ribbons\n\nLast night I went\n\nWith my mother in law\n\nTo The Marlowe Theatre\n\nTo see Buddy The Buddy Holly Story\n\nAnd I had THE BEST time\n\nThe only thing that\n\nWould have made the night\n\nMore perfect\n\nIs if my Dad had been there\n\nI know that he\n\nLike me\n\nWould know every word\n\nEvery beat\n\nTo every song\n\nAnd I know that\n\nHe has his own memories\n\nLinked to the music of\n\nBuddy Holly and The Crickets\n\nIf you have been thinking\n\nThat you might go to the show\n\nWhile it is in Canterbury\n\nI urge you to get tickets\n\nIt was a wonderful evening\n\nOf nostalgia and entertainment\n\nTelling the story of\n\nBuddy Holly’s all too short\n\nCareer in country and\n\nRock n Roll music\n\nSo\n\nIf you knew Peggy Sue\n\nThis is the show for you\n\nI could Rave On\n\nAbout it Everyday\n\nTelling you all the\n\nTrue Love Ways\n\nIn which I adored this show\n\nI would watch it again\n\nIn a Heartbeat\n\nAnd the memories made\n\nLast night\n\nWill Not Fade Away\n\nBuddy: The Buddy Holly Story\n\nIs part musical biography\n\nPart rock n roll concert\n\nAnd the most wonderful\n\nCelebration of the music\n\nOf Buddy Holly\n\nFor fans of Buddy\n\nThe Crickets\n\nFor those who remember\n\nThe birth of rock n roll\n\nFor those raised on\n\nSongs that have stood\n\nThe test of time\n\nSongs that influenced\n\nMusicians for generations\n\nAnd continue to inspire\n\nUs all today\n\nThis is a gift of a show\n\nIt tells the story of how\n\nIn two short years\n\nBuddy Holly\n\nRose to fame\n\nWriting his own songs\n\nPlaying his music\n\nHis way\n\nBreaking records\n\nAnd busting boundaries\n\nShowing the world\n\nThe power of music\n\nAnd that you can be\n\nA kind good person\n\nAnd a rock n roll star\n\nBuddy Holly\n\nAlso made the\n\nWearing of glasses\n\nCool\n\nAnd with the birth\n\nOf rock n roll\n\nAlso came the\n\nFirst teenagers\n\nAnd I think much\n\nOf the audience\n\nLast night were\n\nReminiscing about\n\nTheir own teenage years\n\nSinging and dancing\n\nTo Buddy Holly\n\nThis show is\n\nPunctuated with\n\nPerfect comedic moments\n\nI loved the scene\n\nWhere Buddy and The Crickets\n\nWere the first white musicians\n\nTo play the Apollo Theatre\n\nIn Harlem\n\nBuddy and the boys\n\nRewrite history with\n\nTheir music\n\nAnd their performance\n\nMuch fun is made of\n\nThe white boys\n\nAnd no one anticipated\n\nThe love they would receive\n\nFrom the Harlem crowd\n\nThat night\n\nThe second act of the show\n\nIs mostly given over to\n\nThe 1959 Winter Dance Party\n\nThe last concert that\n\nBuddy Holly played\n\nBefore he died\n\nThe show is fast paced and energetic\n\nThe talented cast all sing and dance\n\nAnd they all play multiple instruments\n\nThe show is an absolute joy\n\nAnd it was very hard not to sing along\n\nThe moments when the audience\n\nAre invited to join in with the show\n\nWere very much appreciated\n\nThe Buddy Holly musical\n\nIs an incredible night\n\nOf memories and music\n\nWith laughter and a love story\n\nAnd heartbreak as the\n\nStory comes to a tragic end\n\nAs the curtain falls\n\nAt the end of Act 2\n\nAnd a lone guitar\n\nIs spotlit in one\n\nCorner of the stage\n\nWe are reminded\n\nOf the day the music died\n\n3rd February 1959\n\nLeaving behind a young wife\n\nAnd unborn child\n\nBuddy Holly died in a plane crash\n\nAged 22\n\nWith Ritchie Valens\n\nAged 17 and\n\nThe Big Bopper\n\n… But February made me shiver\n\nWith every paper I’d deliver\n\nBad news on the doorstep\n\nI couldn’t take one more step\n\n… I can’t remember if I cried\n\nWhen I read about his widowed bride\n\nBut something touched me deep inside\n\nThe day the music died\n\nThis show is testament\n\nTo the legacy left behind\n\nBy Buddy Holly\n\nAnd his friends\n\nTheir music\n\nInspired a generation\n\nAnd that generation\n\nPassed along their love\n\nOf Buddy\n\nAnd now as my Dad raised me\n\nI am making sure my own children\n\nGrow to know and love\n\nCountry music\n\nRhythm and blues\n\nRock n Roll\n\nAnd the incredible songs\n\nOf Buddy Holly\n\nI was given two tickets to the show in return for an honest review"
