        "text": "Post by Andy Howells on\n\nJust caught the documentary on Buddy on SkyArts and I notice the arena documentary from 1985 is getting a repeat tomorrow night on BBCFour. Just got thinking though does anyone have any idea how many TV and radio appearances Buddy and The Crickets made and how much is missing?\n\nI seem to remember reading that Buddy was interviewed for radio during his UK tour in 1958 (I think!) and this recording was erased some years later.\n\nI realise the likelihood of any lost Buddy recordings turning up is probably small but it would be interesting to know if any lost interviews exist.\n\nPost by Joe Haynes on\n\nHey.\n\nThere isnt much footage of Holy unfortunatly. Not long ago a fan made comp off all surving footage was issued.\n\nFrom memory both his Ed Sullivan appearence exist as well on the Arthur Murray TV Show. He also appeared on Bandstand but only a very brief clip is in fan circles.\n\nHe did make an appearance on the London Palladium show but only the audio and a few fan pics still survive. Recently boxsets containing complete recordsing from him in 1956 and 57 have been issued. The next one which should come out this year will have the surviving audio from the london show on one of its disks .\n\nPost by Gary Critcher on\n\nI have the 1956 and 1957 sets, fabulous stuff! Talk about comprehensive! I nfact, I seem toi have two different cd sets fo 1956 recordings ; 'Ohh! Annie!' issued by Rollercoaster Records from Gloucestershire and 'Hollybilly;The Complete 1956 Recordings' issued by El Toro records out of barcelona (!). How on earth do they licence this stuff?? Sorry, getting a bit OT. I'm just wondering how they found all this stuff, including Buddy's PHONE CALLS to his record company!! Joe, perhaps you coul dpoint me towards a Buddy forum or something. I'd love to find out who has kept hold of all this stuff all these years!\n\nPost by Peter Elliott on\n\nHow on earth do they licence this stuff?? Sorry, getting a bit OT. I'm just wondering how they found all this stuff, including Buddy's PHONE CALLS to his record company!!\n\nEuropean copyright laws being what they are means that European labels can release music that is over 50 years old. Notice how Elvis Presley's Sun recordings are now available on various labels at lower prices?\n\nAs for where all these Buddy rarities come from... you never really know for certain. I'd guess it's mainly down to fans who have been able to access tape archives and making copies for themselves which they then give to other people.\n\nAs for TV appearances, a 1960 Buddy Holly Appreciation Society newsletter I believe reported the sad news that Holly and The Crickets sole BBC TV appearance from 1958 had recently been junked. It appears it had been telerecorded and kept for 2 years... and then junked one year after Buddy's death. Goes to show how much the BBC cared about rock and roll, let alone preserving footage of a much loved icon. Utterly criminal since there isn't very much left at all.... mind you at least there is SOME material in existence, which is more than can be said for a lot of names from that era, most notably Johnny Kidd and The Pirates.\n\nPost by Andy Howells on\n\nI seem to recall hearing about that BBCTV appearance. Any info as to what it was and broadcast date?\n\nI think its sheer lunacy that such an act as destroying the recording, a year after Buddy had died happened., Even from a historical or news point of view , you would have thought the recording would have been considered important., and its a shame it was destroyed and deprived all future generations from seeing his only UK TV performance. Thank goodness other recordings survive (no matter how few) from other TV shows (thankyou Ed Sullivan!).\n\nPost by Peter Elliott on\n\nI'm afraid I haven't got any details at hand about the BBCTV performance but I am fairly certain they performed 2 songs and that it might possibly had been mimed.\n\nIt is interesting that The Buddy Holly Appreciation Society were on the ball so early on. I get the feeling they were hoping to get a copy from the BBC, but the BBC took the same attitude as they did to Peter Cook. Cook knew \"Not Only But Also\" shows were being wiped and he offered to buy them from the BBC. No. He offered to replace the VT's. No. The BBC wiped them regardless of the fact one of it's stars desperately wanted copies so they could be preserved.\n\nMust have been galling then for the BHAS members to learn that though it was in the archive for 2 years, the BBC destroyed that piece of Buddy Holly history. Talk about shooting themselves in the foot... had they kept it, imagine the money they could had made licensing out the footage.\n\nPost by Eric Lawton on\n\nInteresting facts popping up here about Buddy Holly on the 50 years since his tragic death. With guys like Buddy Holly, Mama Cass, John Lennon etc, I always think about the great songs that would be part of our history that we will sadly never get to hear. Great songs that would have been written / performed by these People.\n\nOn a similar anniversary note, its 40 years this year since the Moon landings. Wonder if theres anything special planned.\n\nBet Colin knows !\n\nPost by Joe Haynes on\n\nHere a list of all Film material thats known to exist:\n\n1.Elvis Comes to Lubbock - 8mm Colour Film\n\nElvis Performed in Lubbock on 10 April and Ben Hall filmed Buddy in Presley's dressing room. The Same reel of film contains footage of Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash.\n\n2.That'll be the day (fragment)\n\nBuddy and the crickets perform That'llbe the day on KPTV High Time (Similar to American Bandstand) .Only a small clip is know to exist. B: 22 October 1957\n\n3. Ed Sullivan performances\n\nBuddy and the Crickets performed That'll be the Day an Peggy Sue. Ed Sullivan also gives a brief interview with Buddy.\n\nB:1 December 1957\n\n4.

I also know there is a few Home Videos in the Buddy Holly Archives but Buddys widow refuses to ever release Buddy Holly Material Again\n\nHope that helps\n\nPost by Andy Howells on\n\nThanks guys - all clips sound fascinating - I googled Buddy Holly BBC Broadcast and got this result\n\nMarch 14\n\nBuddy Holly and The Crickets perform Maybe Baby, which is broadcast live over the BBC's Off The Record TV show, and I'm Gonna Love You Too for a promotional advertisement for the show. During one of the group's evening performances at the Granada Theatre in Woolwich, London, Mick Jagger is reportedly among the members of the audience.\n\nwww.buddyhollycenter.org/gallery/1958.aspx\n\nMakes interesting reading - does anyone know anything else about Off The Record? I've never even heard of it! Pity it doesnt survive or the other British appearances but its nice to hear there are at least some off air soundtracks and telesnaps! Lets hope we get to see and hear them someday!\n\nPost by Andrew Doherty on\n\nMakes interesting reading - does anyone know anything else about Off The Record? I've never even heard of it! Pity it doesnt survive or the other British appearances but its nice to hear there are at least some off air soundtracks and telesnaps! Lets hope we get to see and hear them someday!\n\nThe very first 'Off the Record' show does exist from May 1955.\n\nThis is the first pop record music series to refer to the Hit parade. It lasts for thirty minutes and is on experimental 8mm cine film recorded by the BBC engineering department at the time.\n\nTop of the bill were 'The Four Aces' and George Shearing.\n\nThe other recording is from 1958.\n\nYours,"
