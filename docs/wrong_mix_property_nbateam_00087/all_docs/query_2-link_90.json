        "text": "Mavs’ big man gets chance to live dream of challenging Lakers\n\nLOS ANGELES — Like many kids growing up in the Los Angeles area, Tyson Chandler played out Laker-themed fantasies while shooting baskets in his backyard.\n\nHis hoop dreams, however, had a different slant than those of most LA kids — “6 … 5 … 4,” Chandler would count, “3 … 2 … 1 …\n\n“I used to imagine myself killing the Lakers,” Chandler recalled Sunday. “So hopefully, my dream comes true.”\n\nChandler and his Mavericks teammates flew Sunday afternoon to his hometown, where Monday night they will play the reigning NBA champion Lakers in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nThis is the sixth trip to the playoffs for Chandler, 28, but his first series against the Lakers. If this seems to be on the corny side of a Hollywood plot, just know that Chandler is visibly thrilled about the opportunity — and determined to maximize it.\n\nIt isn’t that he disliked the Lakers while growing up in San Bernardino, about an hour east of LA. In fact, as a 1983-born kid, one of his earliest childhood memories was watching the late-’80s tail end of the Showtime era.\n\nAs it happens, the last NBA title won by those Magic Johnson-led teams, in 1988, was the last time the Lakers and Dallas were matched in the playoffs.\n\n“Nothing against them,” he said. “I was just a kid, wanting to celebrate on my home floor. I guess I didn’t think I could be one [a Laker], so the next-best thing is to be against them.”\n\nChandler attended six different elementary schools, his family having moved from his grandfather’s Central California Valley farm when Tyson was 10. “I was in high school during the Shaq and Kobe era, so I remember that,” Chandler said.\n\nAs a high school senior, he trekked a two-hour round trip to attend and star at Dominguez High in Compton.\n\nDuring that 2000-2001 season, he averaged 26 points, 15 rebounds and eight blocks and made the Parade All-American team. Sports Illustrated did a major story on him.\n\nHe was a nationally known high school phenom two years before LeBron James. That summer, the Clippers made him the No. 2 overall pick but traded his rights to Chicago.\n\nThe Mavericks are his fourth organization. He is the forceful inside presence this franchise has long lacked and the timing couldn’t be better, with the Lakers’ 7-0, 285-pound Andrew Bynum and 7-0, 250-pound Pau Gasol awaiting.\n\nChandler says the best part about this homecoming is “being on a team I really feel can compete with them.”\n\nBut he is also keeping distractions to a minimum. Although he has dozens of family members who live within an hour of Staples Center, he is not taking ticket requests or visiting relatives.\n\n“We’ve got to stay focused on the prize and what we’re trying to accomplish right now,” he said. “It’s special to go back and play against the champions. If you want to be a champion, you’ve got to go through the champs. What better time to go through them than now?”"
