        "text": "General manager Larry Riley made it clear Wednesday that Chandler, the 7-foot-1 shot-blocker credited with changing the defensive culture for the champion Dallas Mavericks, is the Warriors’ top target. Then, Stephen Curry said he got assurances from Warriors decision-makers that he’ll be the one tossing lobs to Chandler. “I’ll tell you that Tyson Chandler is a guy we’d really love to have here in the Bay Area,” Riley said on KNBR before being asked if Chandler was the Warriors’ Nos. 1-3 free-agent options. “You got it. You stated it, so I’m not going to. You’ve got the picture of where we are. “When Joe (Lacob) and Peter (Guber) bought this team, they bought it to be aggressive and build a team. You can’t say, ‘Oh gee, we can’t get into a free-agent race.’ You have to get into the race and take your best shot. We’ll win those eventually, and I’m thinking we’ve got a great chance right now.”\n\nSources close to the talks believe the winning bid will be about $60 million for a four-year deal. The Warriors don’t have that type of salary-cap space, but they may wait to sign their three rookies, make salary-dumping trades and use the amnesty clause to make the contract fit. “We’re working every possible angle,” Riley said. “The ball is eventually going to be in Tyson’s court and his agent’s when it comes to decision time. Things are going well, we’re in the hunt, we like where we are, and we’ve done all kinds of work. “Things are moving in the right direction. We’re going to keep working and hope for the best.”\n\nThe Warriors, sources said, have made Chandler their No. 1 roster target — no matter what happens with their recent trade talks with the New Orleans Hornets about Chris Paul — and join the Houston Rockets on the list of teams to directly engage Chandler in the past 48 hours.\n\nAs the New Orleans Hornets push closer to making a decision on where to trade Chris Paul, the All-Star point guard has indicated the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors could significantly raise their chances of keeping him beyond this season if they also sign center Tyson Chandler, league sources told Yahoo! Sports on Tuesday. Paul hasn’t promised he would re-sign with one of those teams following the 2011-12 season if they acquired Chandler, but league sources said Chandler could make a significant difference in ultimately swaying Paul to commit to a long-term deal."
