        "text": "After a lackluster 3-6 start the New Orleans Hornets decided a coaching change was in order, and fired Byron Scott on Thursday.\n\nIt is unclear how much of the blame deserved to fall on Scott’s shoulders as the team was blending new players (Tyson Chandler was swapped for Emeka Okafor last summer), a lack of depth, and the drop-off of Peja Stojakovic as a consistent weapon on the perimeter. After all, Scott, the 2007-8 coach of the year, has proven with the Hornets and the Nets that he can be successful when he has the horses.\n\nWhile a number of teams are likely to explore bringing Scott in, the best fit might come with a return to his N.B.A. roots in Los Angeles. There are a number of reasons the Clippers should consider reaching out to Scott. The first is that it would enable the Clippers to move Mike Dunleavy upstairs full time.\n\nI have never been a fan of one person having the dual role of coach and general manger, mainly because under this system the coach lacks accountability. And while Dunleavy, the general manager, has made some nice moves on paper, Dunleavy, the coach, hasn’t necessarily been the right match for his team. By stepping aside as head coach, Dunleavy would be able to focus on his role as G.M., bring in a coach more suited to the playing style of his players, and install a true chain of command between the head coach and general manager.\n\nOther than the injuries that have plagued the Clippers franchise of late, the biggest factor in the team’s performance is the play of Baron Davis. While Davis’s performance has improved from last season (he is averaging 13.6 points and 7.4 assists in 31.8 minutes per game), his playing style remains an uneasy fit with Dunleavy’s game plan. Scott, on the other hand, has a proven ability to succeed with players like Chris Paul, Jason Kidd, and Davis himself, during the 2004-5 season.\n\nFinally, the Clippers would be able to capitalize on Scott’s hometown mojo and name recognition by bringing a mainstay of the Showtime Lakers era back to Los Angeles. It’d provide a popularity bump the team desperately needs, and would be a great complement to the start of the Blake Griffin era in L.A.\n\nThe downside? Scott and Davis weren’t necessarily on the best of terms in New Orleans, and reuniting them in Los Angeles wouldn’t necessarily have a Hollywood happy ending. But they don’t need to be best buds in order to be successful on the court, and Scott would be a better fit to steer the Clipper ship. With a healthy roster and a return to form for Davis, the Clippers are a playoff team. Hiring Scott would be a move in the right direction."
