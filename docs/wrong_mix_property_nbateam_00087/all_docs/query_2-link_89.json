        "text": "1 / 19\n\nPhoenix Suns basketball player Tyson Chandler is undoubtedly up for husband of the year having just surprised his wife Kimberly Chandler with a vow renewal ceremony in Santa Barbara this past July. The couple were high-school sweethearts who initially met on a blind date. “The young lady who introduced us got into an argument with the guy she was with,” remembers Tyson. “So we actually never made it to the bowling alley [we were supposed to go to].”\n\nAfter dating for five years, Tyson proposed to Kimberly in a park in Chicago. “I picked her up from the airport and took her to the park,” explains Tyson, “and gave her a letter that I’d written for her, and then I proposed.” The couple’s wedding was at a church in Beverly Hills and then the reception was at a beautiful wine ranch in Malibu, complete with a menagerie of exotic animals.\n\nAs if that wasn’t romantic enough, ten years after their initial nuptials, Tyson felt compelled to plan a vow-renewal ceremony. \"We’d always talked about renewing our vows after a decade of marriage. We alternate every year on who plans holidays like Valentine’s Day and our anniversary. It was my year to plan our anniversary, and it just so happened to be the tenth year,” explains Tyson. “We were so young when we got married the first time—at 22 and 23 years old—that it just seemed like a nice thing to do.\"\n\nTyson decided to do the ceremony at a private club in Santa Barbara overlooking the Pacific Ocean and enlisted celebrity wedding planner Sharon Sacks to help him pull it all off. \"Kimberly and I drove there three years ago for our anniversary and stayed at a little cottage on the property and just fell in love with the area,” Tyson remembers. \"We are very inspired by the Kennedys and Jackie O, and it just felt like part of their world—chic and glamorous, but still very quaint. I thought it would be a perfect destination spot—close enough so that our families could drive up from L.A. but still a treat in that it felt like everyone was really getting away.\"\n\nKimberly was completely surprised. \"She knew we were renewing our vows, and that she needed to get dresses for herself and our girls,” says Tyson. “But, she had no clue where, when, and how it was going to happen.” She wore a beautiful black lace J’Aton Couture dress. Tyson’s suit was custom Waraire Boswell.\n\nThe couple’s son, Tyson II, walked Kimberly down the aisle at the beachside ceremony, and Tyson’s godson Harlem Taylor was a ring bearer. Daughters Sacha-Marie and Sayge Jozzelle were flower girls as was Kimberly’s goddaughter, Lilly Grey-Mozelle. During the ceremony, Goapele performed “Closer.” \"Our first child was born to this song,\" reveals Tyson, \"so it’s very significant to us. We put it on repeat in the hospital!” Afterwards, the 130 guests in attendance made their way to a seated dinner. Tyson arranged to have a singer, Albert Stanaj, perform during the meal. “He’s very talented—he’s going to be huge,” Tyson predicts.\n\nThe starting center wanted every element of the wedding and reception to feel meaningful so he charged his children with the task of decorating the wedding cake. They drew pics dedicated to their mom and the cake maker printed them on the red velvet, vanilla pound, and coconut chiffon layer cake. After dinner, the singer Daley performed for the couple’s first dance. \"My father-in-law introduced my wife to his voice through YouTube videos,” says Tyson. \"I thought it would be special if he came and performed. And then, DJ Niro flew in from Dallas—he got everyone dancing, and we partied all night.\"\n\nThe party ended up going strong until two in the morning. \"We danced, took photos in the picture booth, and had cigars outside on the beach,” says Tyson. \"I love Randy’s Donuts, so they were delivered late night to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. We also had burger sliders and french fries to sober people up. The hotel was right across the street, so everyone happily stumbled to bed at the end of the night.\""
