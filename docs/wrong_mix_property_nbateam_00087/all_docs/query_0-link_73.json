        "text": "What Is Chris Paul's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nChris Paul is an American professional basketball player who has a net worth of $160 million. According to his latest contract, Chris earns an annual salary of $30 million. He also earns $10-20 million per year from endorsements. During his career so far, Chris has played for the New Orleans Hornets, the Los Angeles Clippers, the Houston Rockets, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the Phoenix Suns. In August 2021, Paul signed a four-year, $120 million contract with the Suns. By the end of that contract, his NBA career earnings will be $446 million.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nChris Paul was born on May 6, 1985, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He is the son of Charles Edward Paul Sr. and Robin Jones. He has an older brother named Charles \"C.J.\" Paul. Charles Sr. was a former athlete himself and taught his sons basketball and football during their childhoods. Paul attended West Forsyth High School in Clemmons, North Carolina, where, as a senior, he led his school's varsity basketball team to a 27â€“3 record. He was a 2003 McDonald's All-American and was named North Carolina's Mr. Basketball for 2003. Chris attended Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem after high school. For two weeks in his sophomore season at Wake Forest, the school was ranked #1 in the nation for the first time in school history. In the last game of the year, in an incident that would mar Paul's image for a bit of time, he punched NC State guard Julius Hodge in the groin and received a one-game suspension for the ACC tournament. Chris played for two seasons at Wake before he announced in April 2005 that he would be hiring an agent, turning professional, and entering the 2005 NBA draft.\n\nNBA Career\n\nChris Paul was selected in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets with the fourth overall pick. Due to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the Hornets played most of their games in Oklahoma City for Paul's two first seasons with the team. Paul was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game in the 2007-2008 season. Chris signed a contract extension with the Hornets worth $68 million prior to the start of the next season. In December of that year, he set the NBA record for consecutive games with a steal. In February 2010, Paul tore cartilage in his knee and was sidelined for over a month by surgery, forcing him to miss the All-Star Game. The next year, he had another injury scare when he suffered a concussion after a collision with a Cavaliers guard, resulting in him being carried off the court on a stretcher.\n\nIn December 2011, the Hornets agreed to a three-team trade that sent Chris to the Los Angeles Lakers. Paul's arrival in Los Angeles rejuvenated the Clippers franchise, and teammate Blake Griffin commented that it \"put us on the map.\" The Clippers qualified for the playoffs that year. Paul re-signed with the Clippers for five years prior to the start of the 2013-2014 season in a deal that was worth $107 million. In the 2014-2015 season, Paul played in all 82 games for the first time in his career. In 2016, he missed 21 regular season games due to either rest or injury. At the end of that season, Chris was not awarded an All-NBA honor, marking just the second time since 2008 he failed to make an All-NBA team and the first time in six years as a Clipper.\n\nIn June 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets. In his debut for the Rockets, he sat down on the bench to stretch and it was later revealed he was playing through a knee injury. Chris then missed the next 14 games. In July 2018, he signed a four-year, $160 million contract extension with the team. The next year, on July 16, 2019, the Rockets traded Paul to the Oklahoma City Thunder. He was then traded to the Phoenix Suns ahead of the 2021 season.\n\nThroughout his NBA career, Paul has won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, an NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, and led the NBA in assists four times and steals six times. He has been selected to ten NBA All-Star teams, eight All-NBA teams, and nine NBA All-Defensive teams.\n\nNational Team Career\n\nIn 2006, Paul made his debut for the U.S. national team at the 2006 World Championship in Japan. He finished the competition with 44 assists and helped Team USA win the bronze medal. Chris played a key role off the bench at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, scoring 13 points in a gold medal game victory against Spain. The team finished the Olympics with a perfect 8-0 record. Paul played as the starting point guard for the 2012 Olympics in London, leading Team USA to another gold medal and an undefeated tournament.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nPaul married Jada Crawley, his college sweetheart, in September 2011. They have a son who was born in 2009 and a daughter born in August 2011. In November 2011, Chris and his family appeared on an episode of \"Family Feud.\"\n\nAs far as other sports, Paul enjoys bowling and owns a franchise in the Professional Bowlers Association called LAX. Chris has hosted and participated in numerous celebrity and youth bowling events as the head of the CP3 Foundation, which benefits Louisianian programs affected by Hurricane Katrina, as well as charities throughout Winston-Salem. In 2018, Paul purchased a minority ownership stake in the Winston-Salem Dash, a minor-league baseball team located in his town.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn April 2019, Chris paid $6.9 million for a mansion in Houston, Texas. He sold this home in January 2021 for $7.2 million. Here's a video tour of this property:\n\nIn 2012, Chris bought Avril Lavigne's Bel-Air mansion for a little under $8.5 million. He sold this home five years later for $8.7 million.\n\nIn 2015, he paid $9 million for a home in Calabasas, California. His immediate next-door neighbor was Khloe Kardashian. He sold this home in 2018 for $11 million.\n\nIn May 2020, he paid $11.1 million for a home in the LA suburb of Encino."
