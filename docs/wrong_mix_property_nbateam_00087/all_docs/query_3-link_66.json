        "text": "Found this great compilation on youtube of all the Tyson Chandler dunks in just the 2014-15 season with the Dallas Mavericks at age 32.\n\nHe's gonna bring the Suns fans to their feet next season.\n\nChandler's 179 dunks all by himself are more than three entire NBA teams managed for the season (Grizzlies, Spurs, Pacers). It's the second most dunks by a single player IN THE ENTIRE NBA for the 2014-15 season (DeAnde Jordan #1).\n\nHis 179 dunks were THREE TIMES more than the highest dunking Suns player last year (Alex Len, 66), and the Suns as a team finished 16th in total team dunks a year ago.\n\nBrandan Wright had 48 dunks in only 40 games, with dunks accounting for 23.7% of all his shot attempts (leading the Suns by a wide margin).\n\nWith Dallas in 2013-14, Brandan Wright had 95 dunks, with dunks accounting for 29.3% of his shot attempts.\n\nIn 2014-15, Tyson Chandler attempted dunks on a whopping 43% of his shot attempts, completing 179. He's had 7 seasons of 100+ dunks in his career, with a career high of 193.\n\nCompare that to former dunk masters Amare Stoudemire and Shawn Marion\n\nAmare: 8 seasons of 100+ dunks, with career high of 237\n\nMatrix: 4 seasons of 100+ dunks, with a career high of 190\n\nWhen does the season start?"
