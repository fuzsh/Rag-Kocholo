        "text": "Scott Cochran was named Special Teams Coordinator in February, 2020, after serving 13 years as head strength and conditioning coach at Alabama.\n\nIn his first year as an on-field coach, Cochran was part of a staff that led Georgia to its fourth consecutive top-10 finish in the final CFP rankings and fourth straight New Year’s Six Bowl game (Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl victory). The 2020 senior class won 44 games—tied for most in school history. In 2020, his specialists included punter Jake Camarda, first-team All-American and SEC Special Teams Player of the Year, and placekicker Jack Podlesny, who kicked the game-winning field goal with three seconds left to win the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl game over Cincinnati. Georgia special teams finished the season ranked first in the SEC and 5th nationally in kickoff returns (29.7 ypr) and first in the SEC in kickoff coverage (41.8 net).\n\nA two-time National Strength Coach of the Year, Cochran was on the staff of six national championship teams – five at Alabama (2009, ’11, ’12, ’15, ’17) and one at LSU (2003). Nationally regarded as one of the best in the area of strength and conditioning, Cochran received one of the highest honors in his field when he was named the 2011 Samson Strength & Conditioning Coach of the Year, as featured in American Football Quarterly. He earlier was named the Samson Strength & Conditioning Coach of the Year following the 2008 season.\n\nUGA head coach Kirby Smart and Cochran both began their careers at Alabama in 2007 and spent nine years together before Smart left to take his current position in Athens. While at Alabama, Cochran implemented an offseason workout plan before spring practice each year, which included the well-known “Fourth Quarter Program” to help players develop physically and prepare for upcoming practices.\n\nOn the way to the 2009 national championship, Alabama won the fourth quarter by an astounding scoring margin of 121-32. The Tide continued the trend of finishing in 2011, as it again dominated the fourth quarter en route to the program’s second national championship in three years with a 111-18 fourth-quarter scoring margin. A third title in four years proved strong in the fourth quarter as well posting a 118-47 advantage. The 2015 team won the fourth quarter 138-80 while the 2017 title team boasted 97-47 advantage.\n\nCochran joined the Alabama staff in 2007 after spending three seasons with the New Orleans Hornets of the NBA as an assistant strength coach. While with the Hornets from 2004-06, Cochran’s duties included assisting with the exercise and strength conditioning programs to help players achieve and maintain optimal fitness throughout the NBA season. With the Hornets, he worked with NBA standouts Chris Paul, Baron Davis, David West and Tyson Chandler.\n\nPrior to joining the Hornets staff, Cochran worked for his alma mater at LSU as an assistant strength coach in 2003 (13-1, BCS national champions) and 2004 (9-3, Capital One Bowl). He was a graduate assistant in Baton Rouge, La., from 2001-03. Cochran returned to LSU after starting his career in the strength and conditioning field at University Laboratory High School in Baton Rouge. He held that position from 1998-2001 before returning to LSU as a graduate assistant for all sports from 2001-03. Cochran then was hired on to the full-time staff for the 2003-04 season."
