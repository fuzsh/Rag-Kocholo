James has been heralded as one of the best players in basketball history, next to no other than the great Michael Jordan. By all accounts, Lebron will be remembered as one of the greatest athletes and people ever.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nCareer Overview\n\nIn 2003, the Cleveland Cavaliers selected James as the overall pick of the NBA Draft. He was the youngest player ever to be picked first in an NBA draft at the time and is only one of two players ever to be drafted straight out of high school.\n\nHis first season was incredible. He set a new NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his first game and was also named Rookie of the Year.\n\nWithin the next few seasons, LeBron rose to stardom, featured in his first All-Star Game, and won multiple Most Valuable Player awards.\n\nIn June 2010, LeBron announced that he would leave Cleveland and sign with the Miami Heat for a six-year deal worth $110 million. ESPN televised the decision on an hour-long special entitled ‘The Decision.’\n\nIn his first season in Miami, James helped the Heat reach the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. The following year, he won his first NBA championship as the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games.\n\nIn 2013, James received his fourth NBA Most Valuable Player Award. He won a second consecutive championship in 2013 as the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games.\n\nHe played for the Miami Heat for four seasons, but in 2014, Lebron James decided to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. With Lebron James as their leading scorer, the Cavaliers won the NBA championship in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2018 that LeBron left the Cavaliers and joined the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent, signing a four-year contract worth $154 million.

However, only $64 million of the value was guaranteed, which is what LeBron earned from the contract.\n\nJames’ contract included an early termination option, which he exercised after the fourth year. This resulted in him earning $64 million over four years. This era of James’ career was coined “The Decision,” with many criticizing him for leaving the Cavaliers for Miami.\n\nLeBron opted out of the contract two years early to sign back with Cleveland on a two-year, $42.2 million deal. He played one season, earning $20.6 million, before declining his play option. James resigned with the Cavs on a slightly higher-paying agreement, earning $23 million in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, LeBron signed his second nine-figure contract, valued at $100 million over three years.

He secured just $64.2 million of the contract’s value before declining his third-year option.\n\nIn 2018, LeBron moved to the Los Angeles Lakers, signing his third nine-figure contract and the most valuable of his career. James inked a four-year, $153.3 million, fully guaranteed deal with the Lakers, increasing his average annual salary to $38.3 million.\n\nThe final year of the agreement was voided to allow James to negotiate a new two-year extension worth $85.6 million.\n\nIn 2023, he signed a two-year veteran extension worth $99 million, which was just shy of becoming his fourth nine-figure contract. Finally, in 2024, LeBron officially signed his fourth deal with a value of over $100 million. His current contract is a two-year, $101 million agreement that will earn him an estimated $48.7 million this year at 40 years old.\n\nThat figure will become the highest annual salary of his career; if he doesn’t decide to retire after that, he could earn an estimated $52.6 million salary in 2025.\n\nLeBron is the only player in NBA history to have signed four 9-figure contracts.\n\nThroughout his NBA career, LeBron James has earned $479.5 million in salary, with another $101 million guaranteed.\n\nEndorsements\n\nLeBron’s endorsement portfolio is awe-inspiring and includes Coca-Cola, Nike, Beats By Dre, Intel, Kia Motors, and Blaze Pizza. His most recent endorsement deal is with Verizon’s mobile television service.\n\nThe Lakers star reportedly signed a three-year deal with the company that will pay him approximately $30 million to promote the service on social media platforms such as Snapchat and Twitter.\n\nLeBron also has business ventures, including Liverpool FC (a small stake), Blaze Pizza (his part ownership helped make it a billion-dollar brand), and Uninterrupted – a digital media company he founded.\n\nLeBron also owns production companies SpringHill Entertainment and The Robot Company, through which he has produced films like Space Jam 2, which stars himself alongside Bugs Bunny; TV shows such as Survivor’s Remorse; documentaries like I Promise; commercial spots for Sprite soda; YouTube content, and more.\n\nIn addition to his off-court earnings from endorsements, business ventures, investments, and production companies, King James is also known for his philanthropy efforts.

But winning that home game (against the Boston Celtics), then going on a six-game road trip, that was either going to make us or break us.” – Tracy McGrady\n\n“I’m still in awe of what that kid did. It was just a hell of a performance for him to shoot the ball only 46 times to score 81 points. But not just to be able to shoot it 46 times, but to shoot it 46 times and hit well over 50 per cent. To take 46 and 20 free throws and end up with 81 points, I didn’t believe it.” – Tracy McGrady\n\n“We’re definitely getting up with them coming back. The last four games, we’re playing very well. With our best players coming back, it’s only going to help improve our team even more and give us a lot more depth. … We’re back on track, and hopefully, we can stay like that.” – Tracy McGrady\n\n“We don’t know who we are. We don’t know if we want to be a team that is to be reckoned with, or we just want to be a team that runs off a four-game win streak, and then we lay down and say, ‘So what?’ and just go back to our old selves. I don’t know, man.” -Tracy McGrady\n\n“It’s every player’s personal goal, to make the All-Star team. It’s a personal accomplishment guys want to make to get a chance to participate against the elite players. Every player in this league wants to be there.” – Tracy McGrady\n\nWhat do you think about Tracy McGrady’s net worth?
