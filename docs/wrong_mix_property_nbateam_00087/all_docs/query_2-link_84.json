        "text": "Speights had lost his shoe on the last possession, and tossed it off to the side so it would be out of the play. He played an entire defensive possession on the other end without it, in which Doyle, sitting next to me, said the words, \"Attack Speights, he has no shoe!\" That may be the first time that sentence has ever been uttered. Then Steph Curry made a lazy pass that Tyson did what he was born to do.\n\nTwitter enjoyed it."
