        "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y. - The anchor of the Dallas Mavericks' defense now centers one of the league's best frontcourts.\n\nTyson Chandler joined the New York Knicks on Saturday, in the belief that joining Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire means he's not done competing for championships.\n\nThe Knicks have long needed a defensive presence, and Chandler plans to provide it.\n\n\"I know what my job is coming here,\" he said. \"I know I came here to defend. I'm going to defend the rim, I'm going to rebound, I'm going to get extra shots. And I think if we play on both ends and play as a team, the sky is definitely the limit for this squad.\"\n\nChandler gets a four-year contract worth about $56 million after coming to the Knicks via sign-and-trade as part of a three-team deal. The Knicks sent Ronny Turiaf and cash to the Washington Wizards and reserve guard Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, and there were other picks involved.\n\nThe Knicks also waived point guard Chauncey Billups and designated him as their amnesty player so they could afford Chandler.\n\nPORTLAND, Ore., - It was once hoped that the trio of Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge and Greg Oden would lead Portland to an NBA championship.\n\nThat possibility was shattered when Roy unexpectedly decided to retire because of ongoing knee problems, Oden suffered another medical setback and Aldridge had a minor procedure to treat a heart condition.\n\nRoy issued a statement through the Blazers on Saturday morning. The three-time All-Star said he would seek a determination that he's suffered a career-ending injury to his knees \"pursuant to the rules of the collective bargaining agreement.\"\n\nThe Blazers could still use the NBA's new amnesty clause to waive Roy, but as of Friday night, the team was still looking at its options, acting general manager Chad Buchanan said.\n\nThe Blazers were also blindsided by the reports about Oden, who by all accounts was progressing well after microfracture surgery on his left knee.\n\nBut on Friday Buchanan announced Oden had suffered another setback, revealed during an MRI of his surgically repaired knee. Buchanan would not say whether Oden could need additional surgery, or whether Oden would play this season.\n\nTo top off the Blazers' woes, Aldridge went to a routine exam by his cardiologist on Friday and it was determined that he should undergo a procedure to treat Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, a condition which causes the ventricles of the heart to contract prematurely.\n\nThe Blazers say he should miss less than two weeks and should be ready for the team's opener on Dec. 26.\n\nATLANTA - The Atlanta Hawks have signed 10-year veteran forward Vladimir Radmanovic, who played last season with Golden State.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Radmanovic averaged 5.1 points and 2.9 rebounds in 74 games with the Warriors. He made 40.5 percent of his 3-point shots, ranking 23rd in the league.\n\nThe deal was announced Friday night by general manager Rick Sund after the Hawks opened training camp. Details were not disclosed.\n\nThe 31-year-old Radmanovic was born in Yugoslavia. He was the No. 12 overall pick by Seattle in the 2001 NBA draft. He also played for the Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte. He has career averages of 8.5 points and 3.9 rebounds."
