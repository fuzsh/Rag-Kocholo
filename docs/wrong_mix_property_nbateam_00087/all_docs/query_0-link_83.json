        "text": "Early life and high school career\n\nChandler was born to Frank Chandler and Vernie Threadgill, though he did not meet his father Frank until later in his life. He grew up in a family farm in Hanford, California, just south of Fresno, California. Chandler began playing basketball at the age of three years on a basket Chandler's grandfather, Cleotis, fixed on a tree. Chandler grew up doing farm work such as milking cows, slopping pigs, and cultivating crops. At the age of nine years, Chandler and his mother moved to San Bernardino, California; he was already nearly six feet tall. As a child, Chandler was teased because of his height; children on his school basketball team joked that he was older than he really was, and that he had been left back several times in school.\n\nChandler and his family then moved to Compton, California, where he enrolled at Dominguez High School, a school known for its athletics, producing basketball players such as Dennis Johnson and Cedric Ceballos. In his freshman year, Chandler made the varsity team and played with future NBA player Tayshaun Prince, who was then a senior. With the Dominguez Dons, Chandler became a teenage sensation; current players such as DeMar DeRozan watched him play and claimed \"he was like Shaq\". Point guard Brandon Jennings, who was a ball boy for Dominguez at the time, said, \"You'd see the girls around Tyson, the Escalade he drove, and you wanted to be like him\". Chandler earned accolades from Parade Magazine and USA Today, and was selected to the McDonald's High School All-America Team. As a freshman, he was profiled on current affairs TV program 60 Minutes.\n\nIn his junior year, Chandler averaged 20 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 blocks. In his senior year, Chandler led Dominguez to a state championship and a 31–4 record, averaging 26 points, 15 boards, and 8 blocks a game. Chandler was recruited by several universities and considered UCLA, Arizona, Syracuse, Memphis, Kentucky and Michigan. Chandler then declared for the 2001 NBA draft as a prep-to-pro.\n\nChicago Bulls (2001–2006)\n\nTyson Chandler was selected 2nd overall by the Los Angeles Clippers, who immediately traded his rights to the Chicago Bulls for former NBA Rookie of the Year Award recipient Elton Brand. The Bulls intended to pair Chandler with fellow high school phenomenon Eddy Curry in the front court. However, while both players had stretches of success during their time with the Bulls, they rarely coincided. In Chandler's case, back problems were a recurring issue throughout his career, particularly during the 2003–04 season. During the early part of his career, Chandler feuded with Brendan Haywood of the Washington Wizards and Amar'e Stoudemire of the Phoenix Suns. Later, although the feuds became less frequent, Chandler struggled with foul trouble, which limited his playing time.\n\nChandler also played a major role in the Bulls' playoff run in the 2004–05 season. Finding a role as a fourth-quarter defensive specialist, with notable game-saving blocks against stars like Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony, he was rewarded with a long-term deal to remain with the Chicago Bulls for the next six years, reportedly worth close to $63 million. With Curry's departure after the 2004–05 season, Chandler became the last member of the Bulls left from the Jerry Krause era.\n\nDuring the 2005–2006 season, Chandler's biggest impact was on defense, but he struggled again with foul problems and averaged only 5.3 points per game. Due in part to his sub-par playoff performance and the Bulls' signing of four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace in the off-season after the 2005–2006 season, Bulls GM John Paxson began to consider moving Chandler. On July 5, 2006, the Bulls and the Hornets verbally agreed to a trade that would send Chandler to the New Orleans Hornets in exchange for J. R. Smith and P.J. Brown. The deal was finalized the following week.\n\nNew Orleans Hornets (2006–2009)\n\nIn his first year in New Orleans (back when the team was facing uncertainty of whether they were coming back to New Orleans or were moving to Oklahoma City), Chandler had a breakout season in 2006–2007, averaging 9.5 ppg and 12.4 rpg to go with 1.8 bpg.\n\nChandler followed that up with an even better season for New Orleans where he put up 11.7 points and 11.8 rebounds a game and led the league in offensive rebounding. His defense, rebounding and the ability to connect with Chris Paul on the Crescent City Connection (Name for their alleyoop pass) allowed the Hornets to claim the 2007–08 Southwest division for the first time ever with 56 wins. Chandler played well in the playoffs and defended Tim Duncan valiantly but in the end the Hornets lost a heartbreaking Game 7 where Chandler limited Duncan to 5–17 shooting.\n\nIn 197 regular season games with the Hornets franchise, Chandler averaged 10.2 ppg, 11.3 rpg and 1.4 bpg, while shooting 61.1% from the field.\n\nOn February 17, 2009, Chandler was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Chris Wilcox, Joe Smith and the rights to DeVon Hardin. However, he failed the physical because of a toe injury, and one day later, the Thunder announced that they rescinded the trade. Coincidentally, the doctor in Oklahoma City who failed Chandler on the physical was the same doctor who had performed corrective surgery on the toe two years earlier.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats (2009–2010)\n\nOn July 28, 2009, he was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Emeka Okafor. Chandler joined a Bobcats team that had never made the playoffs in their young history. Chandler struggled with injuries in 2009–10, missing more than a month with a stress fracture in his left foot. Chandler still helped the Bobcats win 44 games and earn their first-ever postseason berth. The Bobcats, led by Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson, made it to the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and went up against the Orlando Magic. Chandler had the task of defending Dwight Howard. Chandler limited Howard to 9 points and 9 rebounds per game, both below his season and career averages. The Bobcats were, however, swept in their first trip to the playoffs with their Bobcats moniker.\n\nDallas Mavericks (2010–2011)\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Chandler was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, along with Alexis Ajinça, in exchange for Matt Carroll, Erick Dampier and Eduardo Nájera. Chandler was expected to shine next to all-stars Dirk Nowitzki and point guard Jason Kidd. Chandler quickly became a fan-favorite in Dallas because of his defensive efforts and athleticism on both ends of the floor. He was credited with making the Mavericks \"tough\" and anchoring the defense with his hustle and intensity. The Mavericks went 57–25, earning the third seed in the western conference. They defeated a deep Portland Trail Blazers team in six games, swept defending champions Kobe Bryant-led Los Angeles Lakers, and defeated Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook-led Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. The Mavericks went into the NBA Finals as an underdog, facing the Miami Heat and their \"Big Three\" of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Chandler was instrumental in the series, defensively stopping LeBron James' and Dwyane Wade's penetration to the rim. Chandler was forced to play major minutes because of an injury to backup center Brendan Haywood and the inexperience of Ian Mahinmi. In game 4, Chandler recorded 13 points and 16 rebounds, in the pivotal game 5 Chandler recorded 13 points and 7 rebounds and in the decisive game 6, Chandler recorded 5 points, 8 rebounds and 2 blocks, helping the Mavericks win their first championship. For his defensive efforts throughout regular season, Chandler was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.\n\nNew York Knicks (2011–2014)\n\nOn December 9, 2011, Chandler announced that he agreed to terms on a four-year contract with the New York Knicks worth $58 million. He was officially acquired by the Knicks in a three-team sign-and-trade. On Opening Day, Christmas 2011, Chandler finished with 7 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists and 6 blocks in a 106–104 win over the Boston Celtics.\n\nChandler finished the regular season with a 67.9% field goal percentage, the third highest in NBA history until that point, exceeded only by Wilt Chamberlain in 1967 (68.26%) and 1973 (72.7%), and later by DeAndre Jordan. He won the 2012 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award with 45 first place votes and 311 points overall, ahead of Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder with 41 first place votes and 294 votes, and became the first ever Knick to win the award.\n\nIn May 2012, Chandler was named second team All-Defensive behind Ibaka and Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic, who made first-team All-Defensive. Although Chandler was voted Defensive Player of the Year by the press, the All-Defensive Team is chosen by the league's 30 head coaches (who cannot vote for their own players). And while his 13 first-team votes and 36 overall points were more than the totals for first-team selections Tony Allen of the Memphis Grizzlies and Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers, Howard received 41 points with 16 first-team votes, and only one center can be named to the team.\n\nDuring the 2012–13 season, Chandler was named a reserve for the 2013 NBA All-Star Game. It was the first All-Star selection of his career. In February, Chandler recorded 20 rebounds in three straight games, becoming the first Knick to do so since Willis Reed in December 1969. Chandler had 7 points and 8 rebounds at the 2013 NBA All-Star Game.\n\nOn February 27, 2013, Chandler recorded a career-high 28 rebounds, including 13 in the first quarter, in a 109–105 victory over the Golden State Warriors. On November 5, 2013, he suffered a right fibula fracture during a 97-102 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nReturn to Dallas Mavericks (2014–2015)\n\nOn June 25, 2014, Chandler, along with Raymond Felton, was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and two second round picks in the 2014 NBA draft. The move reunited Chandler with teammates Dirk Nowitzki and J. J. Barea, as well as coach Rick Carlisle, who were all part of the Mavericks title team in the 2010–11 NBA season. In his first game back with Dallas on October 29 in the 2014–15 season opener, Chandler recorded eight points and 10 rebounds in a 101–100 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Chandler managed 75 games for the Mavericks in 2014–15, the most since his 2007–08 campaign. Batting through his 14th professional season, Chandler showed that he still had plenty left in the tank as he recorded 31 double-doubles. He also held his own while matched up against Dwight Howard during the first round of the playoffs, averaging 10.2 points and 10.8 rebounds inside during the five match-ups against the Houston Rockets, a series the Mavericks lost 4–1.\n\nPhoenix Suns (2015–present)\n\nOn July 9, 2015, Chandler signed a four-year, $52 million deal with the Phoenix Suns. He made his debut for the Suns in the team's season opener on October 28 against his former team, the Dallas Mavericks, recording three points and six rebounds in a 111–95 loss. He appeared in 15 of the team's first 16 games before missing eight straight games with a hamstring injury. On December 13, he returned to action for the Suns, coming off the bench against the Minnesota Timberwolves and recording three points and four rebounds in 23 minutes. On January 21, 2016, he recorded eight points and a season-high 20 rebounds in a loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Two days later, in a 98–95 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Chandler tied a Suns record with 27 rebounds, including 17 in the first half, and also had 13 points and a season-high five assists. His 27 rebounds equaled the record total set by Paul Silas in 1971, and his 13 offensive boards set a franchise record, surpassing totals set by both Charles Barkley and Curtis Perry. Chandler also became the first Suns player in franchise history to record consecutive 20-rebound games. On March 9, in a loss to the New York Knicks, he became the 50th player in NBA history to reach 9,000 career rebounds. On April 3, he recorded a season-high 21 points and 18 rebounds in a 101–86 loss to the Utah Jazz. He tied that season high four days later, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 124–115 win over the Houston Rockets. Chandler missed the Suns' final two games of the season due to a concussion.\n\nOn October 30, 2016, Chandler recorded 18 rebounds in a 106–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors, passing Hall of Famer Artis Gilmore to move into 48th on the NBA's all-time rebounding list. On December 7, he played in his 1,000th game, the 122nd NBA player ever to reach that milestone. He had 10 points and 10 rebounds in a 109–94 loss to the Indiana Pacers. On December 11, he recorded season highs of 14 points and 21 rebounds in a 120–119 overtime loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, marking his 29th career game with 20+ rebounds and first of the season. Two days later, he grabbed a season-best 23 rebounds against the New York Knicks—he is the only player in franchise history to record back-to-back 20+ rebound games, having done so twice. With his third 20-rebound game of the season on January 3, 2017 in a 99–90 win over the Miami Heat, Chandler became the first Suns player with three-plus in a season since Charles Barkley (5) in 1993–94. On January 12, 2017, he had 14 points and 19 rebounds in a 113–108 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. It was his fourth straight game with 15 or more rebounds, the longest streak by a Suns player since Shawn Marion had four in 2006. Two days later, he had a fifth straight 15-rebound effort in a 108–105 win over the San Antonio Spurs, setting the longest streak by a Suns player since at least the 1983–84 season. On January 19, he recorded a season-high 22 points and 16 rebounds in a 118–103 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He had at least 15 rebounds in his sixth straight game, matching the franchise record set by Jim Fox in 1969. Two days later, he had 16 rebounds in a 107–105 win over the New York Knicks. It was his seventh straight game with 15+ rebounds, setting the longest such streak in Suns franchise history. His streak ended at seven after recording nine rebounds in a win against the Toronto Raptors on January 22. Two days later, he tied his season high with 22 points on 9-of-9 shooting to go with 17 rebounds in a 112–111 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Chandler appeared in just 47 games in 2016–17 after being deactivated following the All-Star break.\n\nNational team career\n\nChandler was named first alternate on the United States national team which competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nChandler was a member of the United States team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, a team that finished 9–0 in the tournament and won the gold medal, the USA's first world championship since 1994. He played in all nine World Championship games as a backup center, averaged 2.6 ppg and 2.7 rpg, shot 64.3 percent from the field, and blocked five shots.\n\nChandler was chosen to play for the United States team in the 2012 London Summer Olympics, and was named the team's starting center. The United States team finished undefeated in the tournament and won the gold medal over Spain with a 107–100 victory. Chandler played 9 minutes, and made 1 of 2 shots from the field. He ended the game with two points, which were the first points scored during the game.\n\nPersonal life\n\nUntil the age of 10, Chandler grew up with his grandfather on a farm in central California.\n\nHis sister, Erica, played basketball at Pepperdine University. He has three brothers: Terrell, Tervon, and Ryan. His paternal grandmother is of German descent. Chandler is the son of Frank Chandler and the late Vernie Re Threadgill.\n\nChandler and his wife Kimberly were married in 2005. They have three children. Chandler and his wife organized a charity to help New Orleans families who suffered from Hurricane Katrina. The charity helped purchase \"small things\" (as Chandler said) for the families' homes: TVs, stoves, microwaves, refrigerators, pots, pans etc. The wives of Chandler's teammates helped in the efforts.\n\nHe was the subject of a limited edition 100 copy zine titled \"Tyson Chandler\". The zine was created in fall 2011 by Camilla Venturini and the photographer Ari Marcopoulos, and was the subject of a lengthy article in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn 2016, Chandler joined UNICEF Kid Power as a UNICEF Kid Power Champion for a mission in Uganda, in an effort to fight global malnutrition and as well as raise awareness among kids, via the world's first \"wearable for good\"."
