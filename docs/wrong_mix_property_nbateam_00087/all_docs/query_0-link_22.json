        "text": "There’s genuine love shared among teammates, and he’s been able to recreate some of that special 2007-08 New Orleans Hornets magic that he cherishes. That team, featuring players like Tyson Chandler, Bonzi Wells and Morris Peterson, was an especially tight bunch. Of this Rockets team, Paul said: “Absolutely. I think we did a great job, and it all started this past summer. Spending real time together, on the road, going out to eat, hanging out and all that stuff. With our team, we got a lot of new faces, so it’s been a lot of fun building it. Like the expectations and what we expect from each other.”\n\nScott Bordow: Quote tonight from Tyson Chandler: “Honestly I’ve been in situations where you were winning and the year felt a lot longer than this one.This is an incredible group of guys. If things would have been bad with the people I had to deal with every day I couldn’t have survived this.”"
