        "text": "The Salmon River, located in Oswego County, stretches 17 miles from the Lighthouse Hill Reservoir in Altmar to where it empties into Lake Ontario at Port Ontario. The Salmon River offers some of the finest sportfishing in the country and is where two major fish records have been set—the Great Lakes record Chinook salmon (47 lbs. 13 oz.) and the world record Coho salmon (33 lbs. 4 oz.). Along the river, there are 12 miles of Public Fishing Rights for access to numerous fishing sites.\n\nAccess:\n\nPine Grove - Pine Grove Rd., off Route 3 half a mile south of route 13 at Port Ontario.

To determine the proportions of wild and hatchery Chinook salmon in Lake Ontario, all Chinook salmon stocked by New York and Ontario from 2008-2011 were marked with an adipose fin clip using an automated fish marking trailer. Percentages of wild Chinook salmon in Lake Ontario varied by year class and age, and among regions from 2009-2015. Overall, wild Chinook were an important component of the Lake Ontario fishery averaging 47% of the age 2 & 3 Chinooks harvested in the lake. The estimated percent of wild salmon in the Salmon River also varied by year, but overall approximately 70% of angler-caught Chinook salmon (excluding age-1) are believed to be wild.\n\nThe current method to estimate the percentage of wild fish in the Salmon River and Lake Ontario uses genetic profiling. A tissue sample is taken from every female fish used during the egg takes in New York and Ontario. A library of the maternal DNA is created and compared to samples collected from Lake Ontario and its tributaries in subsequent years. If the genetics from an angler caught fish matches one of the females that were used during hatchery spawning then that fish is classified as a hatchery fish. Approximately half of the coho salmon being marked from 2016-2018 were of wild origin. Steelhead will be marked in future studies. For more information on Lake Ontario research, view Lake Ontario Fisheries Unit Reports.\n\nEgg collections\n\nThe Salmon River is an important part of the Lake Ontario salmon and trout fishery. Some of the returning salmon and steelhead to the Salmon River make their way to the Salmon River Fish Hatchery. These fish are then used for egg collection and the resulting fish are stocked into many Lake Ontario tributaries, along with the Salmon River. Presently approximately 900,000 Chinook salmon are stocked annually by DEC into Lake Ontario.\n\nManagement Plans\n\nThe 2018 Salmon River Fisheries Management Plan (PDF) was developed with stakeholders input. It provides succinct descriptions of the river's trout and salmon fisheries, and it lays out the framework of major objectives and strategies to manage the river and its tributaries as a premier, high quality, year-round sport fishery, with the opportunity to catch a diversity of trophy sized lake run trout and salmon species. The Plan calls for development of a yearly workplan to guide actions and to share with stakeholders at annual public meetings.\n\nA complementary plan titled the Lower Salmon River Restoration and Recreation Enhancement Plan (PDF) provides a more detailed description of the history of the river and its fishery. The management objectives of this plan primarily covers the 1,700 acres of state property that borders much of the river between the Lighthouse Hill Reservoir and the Village of Pulaski. These lands were acquired to improve and ensure protection of the natural resources, to construct several restoration structures to stabilize river banks and improve aquatic habitat, and to improve public access to the rivers world class fisheries."
