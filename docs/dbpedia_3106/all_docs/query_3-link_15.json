        "text": "What to do in the Salmon Area\n\nPhoto by: Alex Sholes Photography\n\nThis is the right page for anyone wondering what to do in Salmon and the Lemhi County area. Take some ideas from our list below, and start exploring! Want even more ideas? Check out our Event Calendar. Or, head into a local shop and start chatting. This list is just a starting point. You never know what kind of adventure you might find!\n\nIf you have up to 2 hours:\n\nDowntown Salmon is full of great shopping opportunities. You can get antiques, candies, crafted items, local artwork, or a new jacket, shoes, or outdoor gear.\n\nLook for the light blue squares on our visitor’s guide, or find chamber member businesses in the Retail + Shopping section of our directory.\n\nSalmon Idaho’s Island park is the perfect place for a stroll, any time of day. It’s located right under the downtown bridge, making it incredibly accessible. And where else can you get such great views so close to downtown!?\n\nNote: This park is an off-leash space for dogs, so take your pup with you, and be aware others might be doing the same thing! Please, always pick up after your pet.\n\nFind it on our Visitor’s Guide.\n\nThe Lemhi County Historical Society has put together one of the most impressive local museums in the state, with multiple exhibits ranging over different elements of our area’s history, from Native American heritage to Chinese miners, and from river running to ranching. Give them a visit, it’s fascinating stuff!\n\nFind the museum downtown on our Visitor’s Guide.\n\nThe Salmon area has a wide range of food options for your dining pleasure, and a number of bars at which you can grab a drink, if you so desire.\n\nLook for the orange squares on our visitor guide, or check out our member businesses in the the Food and Beverage section of our online directory.\n\nHistory Park is tucked away in the southern 400 block of Main Street in downtown Salmon. It’s an outdoor, always open, free exhibit that walks you through a bit of local history. It’s a perfect, easy stop on a downtown walk.\n\nFind it in the downtown section of our Visitor’s Guide.\n\nQuickly becoming the town of Salmon’s most recognizable location, The Bear is a photo hot spot. Don’t leave town without your Insta photo, and tag it #selfiewiththesalmonbear.\n\nFind it on the Visitor’s Guide.\n\nThe Sacajawea Interpretive, Cultural & Educational Center is dedicated to honoring and providing education about America’s great historical heroine, Sacajawea, an Agai’dika Shoshone-Bannock, and her role in the Corps of Discovery.\n\nThere is much to see and do at the Sacajawea Center for all ages and interests throughout the year! Its river corridor and fields of open space conserve some of the best wildlife habitat in the valley, while providing a peaceful spot to take in the scenic views of the stunning peaks of the Continental Divide.\n\nThe 71-acre park is located just 2 miles east of downtown Salmon, Idaho. Find it on our Visitor Guide.\n\nThe top of S-Hill offers stunning views of both the Salmon and Lemhi river valleys. The best part – these gorgeous views are accessible from town. The starting point (unmarked) is only about 2.1 miles from the downtown bridge.\n\nThe view is amazing, but the trail is not ideal. It’s short, but extremely steep and straight up. You’ll want to be confident of your ability to handle an aggressively steep hiking pitch, and hiking is, as always, at your own risk.\n\nFind it on our Visitor Guide.\n\nIf you have half a day:\n\nTake a look through the list above and start planning!\n\nSalmon is extremely lucky to have multiple beautiful sections of river so easily accessible from town. No matter which stretch you choose, you’ll see birds, beautiful cliffs, and amazing views of surrounding mountains.\n\nThe most common stretches:\n\nShoup to Carmen, which is about 10.8 river miles.\n\nIf you want a shorter stretch, you can go from\n\nShoup to Town (and take out at Island Park Boat ramp). That’s about 6.5 river miles.\n\nTown to Carmen. About 4.3 river miles.\n\nAll of the stretches mentioned above are mellow sections without any big rapids.\n\nEven without major rapids, it’s extremely important that you follow river safety guidelines. If you aren’t familiar with river safety, go with someone who is! Always wear a PFD, and stay alert for obstacles like trees in the river.\n\nOr, go with a guide! Find outfitters on our member business listing under Recreation. Some of these outfitters can also rent you gear.\n\nFind a few of the local boat ramps on our Visitor Guide maps.\n\nA drive downriver from Salmon takes you through a beautiful scenic by-way. Take Highway 93N until North Fork, then take a left down the Salmon River Road to continue your scenic excursion.\n\nThis is also the direction you would take to boat the Day Stretch of the Salmon River. Take your own boat, or find an outfitter to guide you!\n\nPlan a beautiful picnic at some of our most picturesque high mountain lakes!\n\nFor Williams Lake, drive south on the 93 until Shoup bridge, then turn right to cross the bride and follow the signs for Williams Lake.\n\nFor Wallace Lake, drive north on the 93 until you reach the fairgrounds, then turn left and continue on the dirt road until you see signs for Wallace Lake.\n\nFind their general locations on the Visitor’s Guide.\n\nThe Salmon City Outdoor Pool offers an awesome way to cool off and splash around during the summer months. The Pool can be found in the City Park just east of town (about 1.75 miles from the downtown bridge) making it very accessible.\n\nHere is the City’s webpage for the Pool, and also the Salmon City Pool’s Schedule.\n\nYou can also find it on the Visitor’s Guide.\n\nAviation is an interesting piece of Idaho’s history, and also offers one of the best ways to see the valley and surrounding areas.\n\nGet to the Frank with a scenic breakfast flight to a backcountry lodge with Gem Air, or take a shorter tour just around the valley.\n\nYou can also fly between Salmon and Boise year-round, which makes connecting to the valley super easy.\n\nDiscovery Hill, or Disco Hill, offers incredibly easy access to both hiking and biking, right next to town. The trailhead is about 2 miles from the downtown bridge.\n\nThese trails offer some great singletrack, and amazing views. This trail system is often open to mountain bikes when most other trails are still too muddy in the spring, or too snowy, and the trails remain accessible to bikes much longer in the fall that most.\n\nAnd it’s a really great place for hiking or trail running pretty much all year round. It can get ripping hot in the summer though, so early morning or late evening rides/hikes are best in July and August.\n\nFind more info on the BLM’s Discovery Hill Page, or the Trailforks Site.\n\nSharkey Hotsprings is perfect for a cold-weather or summer evening soak. It’s about a 30 minute drive from Salmon. You can drive right up to it, and enjoy the hot water in man-made pools that get drained and cleaned every week.\n\nVisit the BLM’s Sharkey Hotsprings page for more info.\n\nGetting to Goldbug involves both a 25 minute drive and a ~2 mile hike, but most people agree it’s worth the effort.\n\nThese hotsprings are undeveloped, letting you soak luxuriously in a natural setting. The views are gorgeous.\n\nThis particular location has gained a lot of attention in recent years, and so it sees a lot of use. Please be extremely respectful of this amazing place – don’t leave ANY trash, and if you see someone else has left a mess, help out by cleaning it up.
