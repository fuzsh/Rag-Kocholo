        "text": "GED is a program of the American Council on Education, a private, not-for-profit education association. The GED test reflects the knowledge of graduating seniors obtained after completing a traditional 4-year program of study.\n\nThe GED is offered through Pearson Vue in English and Spanish at each main campus. Registration and payment are through the GED website: www.GED.com.\n\nThe complete battery of GED tests is approximately 8 hours long. There are four sections: Language Arts: Reading and Writing, Math, Science, and Social Studies. Each part of the exam can be scheduled on different days or in a single long session. If you take more than one section, a ten (10) minute break will be allotted between each part of the exams.\n\nReports reflecting their scores will be available through www.GED.com, usually within 24 hours. Those candidates achieving a passing score will receive a GED certificate sent via www.diplomasender.com.\n\nOfficial Transcripts can be requested through www.diplomasender.com.\n\nWho can take the GED?\n\nIndividuals 16 years of age or older can register to take the GED. However, interested 16 years old must gain approval from the CCSD to take the exam.\n\nAnyone 18 or older may register for the GED as long as they do not possess or will not gain a valid High School Diploma.\n\nCandidates, 17 years of age will need to have a current withdrawal or official statement from CCSD of non-enrollment and a parent or guardian's written permission.\n\nA current Government-issued photo ID and proof of Nevada residency are required at the time of testing.\n\nAcceptable identification: (must be present)\n\nDriver's license/State ID\n\nValid passport\n\nMilitary ID\n\nAn unexpired government-issued ID from another state may be used in conjunction with proof of local address (i.e. utility bill showing candidates name and local address).\n\nThese exams encompass a combination of tests that identify interest and personality preferences for use in career exploration. This is a computer-based test that is available online and can be taken at one of the main Assessment/ Testing Centers or from the comfort of your home.\n\nYou may take the SII and MBTI at the Testing Center or home. Please contact the Testing Center for more information.\n\nPlease note: The CSN does not interpret either the WOWI or SII/MBTI through our advisors/councilors. Although the results may be read personally, interested students will need to find an interpreter, if desired/needed."
