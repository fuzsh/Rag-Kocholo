I welcome enquiries for research supervision in these areas.\n\nMy most recent publications include chapters about Barack Obama and David Cameron, and Donald Trump and Theresa May, and Trump and Boris Johnson for the Palgrave Handbook of Presidents and Prime Ministers. Before that was a chapter on popular culture in 1960s Britain for a volume on imperial history, one on the 1970 General Election for a book marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Heath government, and another on Parliament and the death of Margaret Thatcher for a book about Thatcherism.\n\nForthcoming I've two books contracted for publication in 2024: Margaret Thatcher's World (De Gruyter), an international history of Thatcherism, and Reginald McKenna: Statesman among Financiers, 1916-1943 (Routledge), the second (and final) volume of my biography which is very close to completion. I've also written 'Obituarial Lives', a chapter political obituaries and what I coin the 'obituarial turn', for a book called Genres of Political Writing in Modern Britain (Cambridge) which will also be out in 2024.\n\nI have 'in progress' two chapters on Douglas Hurd and John Moore for a book I'm co-editing called Thatcher's Ministers (Palgrave Macmillan), also due in 2024. There's also an article which offers a comparative assessment of the deaths of Hugh Gaitskell (1963) and John Smith (1994), and another on the film version Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), which have been researched, and await time to write.\n\nI've published on declinism and British coastal resorts, British mass tourism in the 1970s, the 1918 Reform Act and the House of Commons, and the Labour Party in the 1980s (in Labour and the Left in the 1980s). Other publications include the first volume of a political biography, and articles on British politics and strategy in the First World War, the 1918 General Election, and the Labour Party and strategic bombing in the Second World War. I've co-edited two volumes on the British abroad: Travellers and Tourists and Experiencing Imperialism, in the former of which I've a chapter on British mass tourism. In 2014 I was principal investigator for the North East and Cumbria on the AHRC/BBC project World War One at Home. I also interview former MPs for the History of Parliament Oral History Project.\n\nI head Britain and the World, an international research association which has a peer-reviewed journal, book series, and an annual conference which alternates between the US and the UK.\n\nSelected conference papers\n\n'Douglas Hurd', The UK Conservative Party and 'True' Conservatism', Edinburgh University, 14 January 2023\n\n'Johnsonism and Transatlantic Foreign Policy', Transatlantic Studies Association Conference, University Kent, 6 July 2022.\n\n'Brexit, Covid, Aukus, Ukraine', Britain and the World conference, University of Plymouth, 16 June 2022\n\n'Changing Perceptions of Europe in 20th-Century Britain', Conceptualising Europe: From Antiquity to Modern Times, Newcastle University, 29 April 2022\n\n‘Global Britain: past, present, and future’, The UK and the World, The 2nd Anglo-American Studies Roundtable at Anglo-American University Prague, 24 September 2021\n\n‘The Member and Their Constituency, 1918-2020’, Political Studies Association, Politics and History Specialist Group Annual Conference, Manchester University, 16 October 2020\n\nParliament and the Passing of Margaret Thatcher, 40 Years of Thatcherism?
