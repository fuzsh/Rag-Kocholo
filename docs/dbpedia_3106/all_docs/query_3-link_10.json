        "meta_description": "Known as “The River of No Return,” the Salmon River originates in the Sawtooth and Lemhi Valleys of central and eastern Idaho; snows from the Sawtooth and Salmon River Mountains in the south and the Clearwater and Bitterroot Mountains in the north feed this river. The upper section passes through the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, while the lower section forms the southern boundary of the Gospel-Hump Wilderness.",

        "text": "The drainage lies within the eastern and northern portions of the Idaho Batholith Province of central Idaho. The Idaho Batholith Province is comprised primarily of the Idaho batholith, which was intruded into what is now central Idaho approximately 80 to 100 million years ago. The province also includes much older rocks that were intruded by the batholith, younger intrusive rocks, and much more recent erosional deposits. The older rocks consist of quartzites of the Yellowjacket Formation and their metamorphosed equivalents. These rocks are approximately 1.5 million years old. The younger intrusive rocks consist primarily of the Casto pluton granite and associated dikes and surface volcanic flows. These rocks are approximately 50 million years old. Recent geologic features include stream terraces and rock falls from various time periods. As can be imagined from the foregoing, a trip through this canyon is truly a rare “trip through time”—1.5 million years ago to the present. In addition, due to the excellent rock exposures in the arid canyon, many geologic features and processes are exposed throughout the system. Examples include joint formation, downcutting, terrace formation, and the geologic nature of each of the canyon’s famous rapids.\n\nThere has been no systematic inventory of the entire Salmon River corridor for historic sites; however, unpublished monitoring and inventory work by the Salmon-Challis National Forest suggests large numbers of significant historical sites exist all along the river. Mining and homesteading began in the area in the 1880s and the traces of these long-abandoned mines and cabins can still be seen. Outstanding examples include the Blackie Foster cabin, Jim Moore Ranch, Polly Beamis cabin, Shoup townsite, Gold Hill Mine, Clipper Bullion Mine, and other sites. The Forest Service started administering the river corridor around the turn of the 20th century, and sites, such as the 1909 Indianola Ranger Station and Long Tom Picnic Area, are outstanding examples of early Forest Service architecture and administration. In the 1930s, The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) established camps along the Salmon River, like Ebenezer Bar CCC Camp, and reconstructed or constructed many of the roads and Forest Service administration and recreation sites in the area, including Indianola and Long Tom Picnic Area. Additionally, they opened up the upper portion and lower portion of the river corridor by constructing the Salmon River Road through extremely difficult terrain and conditions.\n\nThe Salmon River flows through the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. The river corridor offers a variety of land-based dispersed activities, including, hunting, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, and camping. Fishing and hunting are the predominant uses in October, November, February, and March. Short sections of trail provide access into the river corridor in numerous locations throughout its length. Trail use is by foot and horse.\n\nHowever, whitewater boating is by far the predominant use from April through September and is what the river is best known for. The Salmon River is world renowned in the boating community and origin of visitors reflects an international flavor. The wild section offers multi-day trips, while the recreation section offers primarily day use trips. Approximately 7,000 people go down the corridor via float boat each summer through Class I to Class IV whitewater. The Salmon’s abundant sandy beaches provide campsites to float groups throughout the summer and fall.\n\nOnce deemed impossibly rough for navigation by the famous Lewis and Clark expedition, with the recent advent of power boats, skilled operators have been able to travel up-river. Even today however, this trip demands the best in skill, experience, and equipment. The historical use of jetboats was recognized by Congress as an integral part of the transportation system on the Salmon River; therefore, provisions were made to continue powerboat use.\n\nPermits are required for both float boats and jetboats on the wild section during the control period of June 20 - September 7. All floaters are required to carry fire pans, portable toilets, ash containers, shovel, bucket, and food strainer. Leave No Trace and minimum-impact camping techniques are the required method of dealing with your overnight stay in the corridor. Applications for permits are taken in December through January through the National Recreation Reservation System at rec.gov.\n\nJet boat permits are issued on a phone-in, first-come/first-served basis.\n\nThe Salmon River corridor is classified as Variety Class A, indicating it contains distinctive visual features. The riverine setting is generally natural in appearance, with human activity such as private land development, historic mining, and recreation use, having relatively little impact to scenic character. From the braided channel and island complex at Deadwater to the vertical granite cliffs at Pine Creek and Black canyon to the mature ponderosa pine stands to the cascades at Salmon Falls to the cliffs and slackwater at Mackay Bar, the Salmon River canyon displays an outstanding diversity of visual elements. From the river, there are distant views of forested peaks and ridges, while the foreground and middleground views are of forested slopes, interesting rock outcrops, high gradient rushing streams from side drainages, and highly diverse riparian vegetation. Similar views are afforded from river side trails where they exist. The user’s focus is usually on the river; its fast-moving water through rapids and still water pools in between."
