        "text": "No matter from which direction you come in to our valley, you’ll be on a gorgeous scenic byway. Check out the map below.\n\n-Salmon, Idaho is a 2hr 40min drive south of Missoula, Montana.\n\n-We’re about 2hr 30min north of Idaho Falls, and about 6 hours north of Salt Lake City.\n\n-And about 5hr 30min north east of Boise, Idaho, the state capitol.\n\nThere are worthwhile attractions along all these routes, from historical sites to hotsprings to cute little mountain towns. If you can, plan some time in your road trip for frequent stops!\n\nOur little town is the only one in the state with year-round direct flights to Boise, Idaho. Take a look at Gem Air’s website, or find their information on our Transportation Page.\n\nFlying has a rich history in Idaho, and it also gives you a really special perspective on the land through which you travel. Even if you normally drive, this is worth doing at least once.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no regularly scheduled shuttles or buses between Salmon and neighboring cities.\n\nSalmon does not have any name-brand car rental services, which means you can’t rent a car elsewhere and then leave it here. You can rent a car while you are in town, however. Call Quality Motors and ask about their rental availability."
