History

FLS began as a small English language school and translation service in Southern California in 1986. From these humble beginnings, FLS has grown into a leading national provider of English language training and study tours. FLS has year-round programs at schools in 7 major US cities. Most of these programs are on college campuses. FLS Las Vegas was originally on the West Charleston campus of CSN. That was where FLS held its ESL classes for more than 10 years. Although we moved off campus several years ago, we still have a really close relationship with CSN, because many of our students continue their studies at CSN or UNLV after they have gained confidence and fluency in English at FLS. We moved to a beautiful new facility at the District at Green Valley Ranch in 2013 and have been here since then.
