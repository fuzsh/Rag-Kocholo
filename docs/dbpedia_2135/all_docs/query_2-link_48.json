        "text": "CZECH MODERNISM: THE 1920'S to the 1940's\n\nFebruary 16-22, 2007\n\nON THE SUNNY SIDE\n\n(NA SLUNEČNÍ STRANĚ)\n\nFri., Feb. 16 at 7 p.m.\n\nOne of the great masterpieces of early Czech sound cinema, this experimental\n\nclassic combines elements of Soviet montage, BuZuelian surrealism, and Czech\n\npolitics in this examination of a state home for children. The plot is\n\nnominally about the arrival of new kids from a broken home, but this is just\n\na framework for a series of otherworldly tableaus, frightening set design,\n\nand ahead-of-their-time camera angles that make the whole film an exercise\n\nrich in symbolism and imagery. Directed by Vladislav Vančura,\n\nCzechoslovakia, 1933, 35mm, 76 mins. With Jindřich Plachta, Václav Vydra,\n\nZdeňka Gräfová\n\nTHE STRIKE\n\n(SIRÉNA)\n\nFri., Feb. 16 at 8:30 p.m.\n\nThe only Czech film to win the main prize at the Venice International Film\n\nFestival, The Strike takes its story from real events in 1889 to depict a\n\nmining family struggling with debt and alcoholism. Their problems grow as\n\nthe father is fired because of his connections with the unions, and the\n\nstrike takes its toll. A fascinating piece of Czech Communist ideology, the\n\nfilm also possesses a sooty, blackened realism that is remarkable for the\n\npost-WWII era. The film will be presented with English subtitles for the\n\nfirst time in a newly struck print. Directed by Karel Steklý\n\nCzechoslovakia, 1947, 35mm, 83 mins.\n\nTONKA OF THE GALLOWS\n\n(TONKA ŠIBENICE)\n\nSat., Feb. 17 at 7 p.m.\n\nOriginally shot as a silent film, sound was added later to make this\n\nCzechoslovakia’s first sound film. Tonka stars the beautiful Ita Rina (the\n\nlead in Erotikon) as a reluctant prostitute who volunteers to stay the night\n\nin prison with a condemned man. But after this act of charity she is turned\n\naway from the brothel, and viewed as a bad omen, as portrayed through Anton’\n\ns vivid expressionist camerawork. With Ita Rina and Vera Baranovskaia.\n\nDirected by Karel Anton, Czechoslovakia, 1930, 35mm, 84 mins. The film will\n\nbe presented in the original silent version with musical soundtrack and\n\nFrench intertitles with English subtitles.\n\nFROM SATURDAY TO SUNDAY\n\n(ZE SOBOTY NA NEDĚLI)\n\nSat., Feb. 17 at 8:45 p.m.\n\nMachatý, a master at conveying sexuality in Pre-Code cinema, makes his first\n\nsound film a simple tale of a young woman attracted by the glamour of the\n\nchampagne set, only to find herself repulsed when she is offered money for\n\nsex. Fleeing the scene she runs into a good-hearted workingman, whose simple\n\ndecency wins her over. Like Lang’s M, this is a fantastic example of a\n\nsilent director embracing sound and using it creatively, as Machatý does\n\nwith an innovative score by jazz great Jaroslav Ježek. Directed by Gustav\n\nMachatý, Czechoslavakia, 1931, 35mm, 72 mins. With L. H. Struna, Magda\n\nMaděrová\n\nTHE KREUTZER\n\n(KREUZEROVA SONÁTA)\n\nSun., Feb. 18 at 2 p.m.\n\nAfter several years in Hollywood working with Griffith and Von Stroheim,\n\nMachatý returned to Czechoslovakia to direct his first feature film, The\n\nKreutzer Sonata. Based on the Tolstoy novel, the film recounts in flashback\n\nthe story of a wealthy man who confesses to killing his wife, while at the\n\nsame time denouncing the hypocrisy of contemporary society. Machatý employs\n\na flamboyant style reminiscent of Expressionism that he would later perfect\n\nwith Erotikon. Directed by Gustav Machatý, Czechoslovakia, 1926, 35mm, 95\n\nmins. With Eva Byronová, Jan W. Speerger, Miroslav Paul. *Screening with\n\nlive piano accompaniment by David Drazen and the Czech titles will be read\n\naloud in English.\n\nSUCH IS LIFE\n\n(TAKOVÝ JE ŽIVOT)\n\nSun., Feb. 18 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nSuch is Life can best be summed up by its subtitle, “A Novel About Prague\n\nWasherwomen.” Creating cinematic poetry from the poverty in the streets,\n\nJunghans shot on location this story about a washerwoman, her no-good\n\nhusband, and her remarkable resilience in the face of tragedy. This is an\n\nearly precursor to the Czech realist tradition; imagine if Murnau had shot\n\nSunrise on location, and you have some idea of its beauty. With Vera\n\nBaranovskaya, Theodor Pištěk. Directed by Karl Junghans, Czechoslovakia,\n\n1929, 35mm, 73 mins. *Screening with live piano accompaniment by David\n\nDrazen and the Czech titles will be read aloud in English.\n\nTHE RIVER\n\n(ŘEKA)\n\nMon., Feb. 19 at 7 p.m.\n\nWith a tempo as unhurried and pleasant as the meandering stream of the\n\ntitle, The River follows a young boy through several vignettes depicting his\n\nlove for a village girl, resulting in a furious battle with a fish, and a\n\nbrief misunderstanding. Yet while Rovenský paints this portrait of country\n\nfolk with bold strokes, the film never descends into parody, remaining a\n\ngentle tribute to the simplicities and beauty of small town life. Directed\n\nby Josef Rovenský, Czechoslovakia, 1934, 35mm, 88 mins. With Jarmila\n\nBeránková, Václav Jalovec\n\nCRISIS\n\n(KRIZE)\n\nMon., Feb. 19 at 8:45 p.m.\n\nAn incredible document of the times, Herbert Kline (an American) worked with\n\nCzech directors Alexander Hackenschmied (a.k.a. Sasha Hammid) and Hans\n\nBurger to produce this documentary about the rise of Nazi fascism and its\n\nthreat to Czechoslovakia. Its immediacy remains startling even today; this\n\nis no newsreel, but a desperate attempt to warn of a nation’s danger. It\n\npremiered in New York City just two days before Czechoslovakia was occupied\n\nby Germany. The film, his feature debut as co-director, was ultimitely a\n\nreason for Hammid to emigrate to the United States where he became the\n\nfounder of American experimental cinema with his wife Maya Deren. In\n\nEnglish. Directed by Herbert Kline, Czechoslovakia, 1938, 71 mins.\n\nHEAVE HO!\n\n(HEJ RUP!)\n\nTues., Feb. 20 at 7 p.m.\n\nThurs., Feb. 22 at 9 p.m.\n\nBearing more than a passing resemblance to Renoir’s Popular Front films,\n\nthis film is a rarely seen combination of socialist comment and riotous\n\nlaughter; imagine the Marx brothers taking their name politically and you\n\nhave some idea of the joys of Heave Ho!. Generally considered one of the\n\nbest cinema outings by famous slapstick duo of Voskovec and Werich, the plot\n\nconcerns an industrialist and labor organizer working together to create\n\ntheir own socialist nirvana. The auteur duo of Voskovec and Werich spent the\n\nWWII years in political exile in America. After the war Werich returned to\n\nCzechoslovakia while Voskovec stayed in New York. Voskovec became one of the\n\nstars of Sidney Lumet’s acclaimed film 12 Angry Men. Sadly the Communist\n\nregime never allowed for the influential artistic duo to reconnect. With\n\nJiří Voskovec, Jan Werich. Directed by Martin Frič, Czechoslovakia, 1934,\n\n35mm, 87 mins.\n\nVIRGINITY\n\n(PANENSTVÍ)\n\nTues., Feb. 20 at 8:45 p.m.\n\nA shimmering tragedy in the Hollywood mold, Virginity concerns a beautiful\n\nyoung woman prepared to sell herself into marriage to obtain money for her\n\ndying lover’s treatment, while the camera tracks through gaudy nightclubs\n\nand overstuffed apartments. This is one of the first films by the great\n\nVávra, a leading fixture in Czech cinema who, at the age of 95 is still\n\ndirecting films! With Lída Baarová, Ladislav Boháč. Directed by Otakar\n\nVávra, Czechoslovakia, 1937, 35mm, 84 mins.\n\nFAITHLESS MARIJKA\n\n(MARIJKA NEVĚRNICE)\n\nWed., Feb. 21 at 7 p.m.\n\nA breathtaking drama about life lived on the edge of civilization, Faithless\n\nMarijka takes place in mountain solitude where a young woodcutter must\n\njourney into the woods, leaving his young wife with another man. The film\n\nwas shot in the Carpathian mountains of the Western Ukraine, using local\n\npeople as actors against the striking vistas, and also features a score by\n\nprominent Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů a long-time New Yorker himself.\n\nWith Anna Škelebejová, Petro Birčak. Directed by Vladislav Vančura,\n\nCzechoslovakia, 1934, 35mm, 76 mins. In Czech, Ruthinian, Slovak and\n\nYiddish with English subtitles. New print\n\nTHE DISTANT JOURNEY\n\n(DALEKÁ CESTA)\n\nWed., Feb. 21 at 8:30 p.m.\n\nThurs., Feb. 22 at 7 p.m.\n\nConfronting the horrors of history head on, Radok and his crew shot this\n\nfirst feature film about the Holocaust just three years after the war ended.\n\nThe film combines actual footage with reenactments and Expressionist camera\n\nsetups to create a vivid, immediate look at the concentration camps. With\n\nBlanka Waleská, Otomar Krejča. “Audacious and grotesque, the movie looks\n\nback to Caligari and forward to the unsettling puppet animation of Jan\n\nŠvankmajer.” -J. Hoberman. Directed by Alfred Radok, Czechoslovakia, 1949,\n\n35mm, 103 mins.\n\nCzech Modernism was produced and co-curated by Irena Kovarova for\n\nBAMcinématek and National Gallery of Art. Film prints provided by National\n\nFilm Archive and Anthology Film Archive. Additional support provided by the\n\nCzech Center New York. Film notes BAM and Irena Kovarova."
