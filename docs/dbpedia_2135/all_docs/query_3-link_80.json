        "text": "Love of master Nazi propagandist Goebbels: LIDA BAAROVA\n\nAt one stage Goebbels wanted to leave his wife Magda for Lida Baarova. But Hitler intervened and broke the love affair. The Third Reich could not afford such scandals. Here is the story of love and lust in Nazi Germany. The affair between actress Lida Baarova and Joseph Goebbels.\n\nDr Goebbels's fires, however, burned fiercer. He lived only three doors along from the house on Lake Wannsee which Lida Baarová shared with Gustav Froehlich, her co-star in Barcarole. Though Lida Baarová always emphasised the innocence of her relations with Goebbels - \"why would I be interested in a 36-year-old father of five when I was a 20-year-old beautiful woman with men falling at my feet?\" - somehow Froehlich was never convinced.\n\n\"His voice seemed to go straight into me,\" she said. \"I felt a light tingling in my back, as if his words were trying to stroke my body.\"\n\nLida Baarova: The actress that Goebbels loved and yearned for\n\nHermann Goring placed a wiretap on Lida Baarová's telephone, and enjoyed spreading scandalous stories about her and Goebbels in the highest Nazi circles. Himmler also liked to tell how there were lines of women waiting to swear how Goebbels had coerced them: \"I've turned the choicest statements over to the Fuhrer.\" Goebbels himself felt the necessity to tell his wife Magda about his infatuation. Magda complained to Emmy Goring that her husband was \"the devil incarnate\". But she did not stop there, inviting Lida Baarová round to accuse her to her face of having an affair with her husband. \"Don't worry,\" Lida Baarová returned, \"I'm not interested in him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the jealous Gustav Froehlich was rumoured to have struck Goebbels in the face, and challenged him to a duel. Hitler, furious at the scandal, banned Lida Baarová's films and expelled her from Berlin. Wisely, she escaped to Prague.\n\nsource: picture history blog..."
