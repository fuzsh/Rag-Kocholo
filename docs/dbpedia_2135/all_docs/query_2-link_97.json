        "text": "A certified civil engineer with his own design studio; he specialised in smaller buildings. He participated in the Baba estate by designing the Lužný House and Bautz House and cooperating on the design of the Munk House with Josef Fuchs during the first stage of the project. As František Munk’s nephew, he supervised the construction of the house until its completion. The Munks moved into the house only after returning from a business stay in the USA. He also supervised the construction of the Czechoslovak Werkbund’s House of the Art Industry by the architect Oldřich Starý.\n\nAn architect who studied in the Hague and Vienna and was a student of Josef Gočár at the Prague Academy of Fine Arts. He managed an independent architectural studio together with his brother Karel Fišer. In addition to the Joska House in Baba, they also designed other houses and buildings throughout the country.

But Fuchs soon found himself part of the constructivist and modernist movement. Together with Oldřich Tyl, he designed the Trade Fair Palace, an icon of interwar functionalism admired by Le Corbusier himself. He worked with an idea of maximum functionality. His projects excel in perfect proportionality and geometric accuracy. He received a number of awards, both at home and abroad, such as the bronze medal at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925 (for interior design) or being made a Knight of the Legion of Honour (for the design of the French exhibition at the Prague Fair in 1930).\n\n1916-1920\n\nstudied architecture with Professor Josip Plečnik at the Academy of Arts, Architecture, and Design in Prague\n\n1920-1923\n\ncooperated with the studio of Professor Jan Kotěra in Prague\n\n1923-1948\n\nindependent architect in Prague\n\nSignificant Works\n\n1924-1928\n\nTrade Fair Palace, Prague-Holešovice (in cooperation with Oldřich Tyl)\n\n1931\n\nentrance building of the ZOO in Prague-Troja\n\n1932\n\nhouse of František and Naďa Munk, Baba, Prague-Dejvice\n\n1934\n\nice hockey stadium in Prague-Štvanice\n\nvillas in Prague Pelc-Tyrolka and Prague-Dejvice\n\nAn architect, professor, urban planner (Hradec Králové and Pardubice), and designer of furniture and articles for daily use. Josef Gočár was a generally respected figure of Czech architecture; he influenced many of his students and the following generations of architects. His works display the world’s rarity of Czech cubism in architecture (the iconic House at the Black Madonna) and rondocubism (the Legiobanka building, Na poříčí Street), the influence of constructivism or even designs in the national or Art Deco style. His professional life culminated with functionalism; the villas of the Baba estate (the Maule, Kytlice and Glücklich Houses) or the Church of St. Wenceslas in Vršovice. In 1925, he received the Grand Prix for his design of the Czechoslovak pavilion at the International Exhibition in Paris and, in 1926, he received the Order of the French Legion of Honour.\n\n1902-1905\n\nstudied architecture with Professor Jan Kotěra at the Academy of Arts, Architecture, and Design in Prague\n\n1905-1908\n\ncooperated with the studio of Professor Jan Kotěra in Prague\n\n1906\n\nspent several months in London while supervising the Czech installation at the London Exhibition\n\n1908-1945\n\nindependent architect in Prague\n\n1908\n\nmember of the Mánes Union of Fine Arts\n\n1911\n\nco-founder of the Cubist Group of Fine Artists\n\n1912\n\nco-founder of the Prague Art Workshops (PUD)\n\n1913-1914\n\nmember of the Association of Czech Works (SČD)\n\n1916-1919\n\nmilitary service\n\n1920-1924\n\nPresident of the Czechoslovak Werkbund (SČSD)\n\n1924\n\nprofessor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague\n\n1927\n\nmember of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts\n\n1928-1931\n\nRector of the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague\n\n1934\n\ncorresponding member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)\n\nSignificant Works\n\n1909\n\nWenke’s House, Jaroměř\n\n1910\n\nJarušek’s House, Brno\n\n1911-1913\n\nThe House at the Black Madonna, Prague-Staré Město\n\n1912-13\n\nSpa Pavilion, Bohdaneč\n\n1920\n\nCzechoslovak Pavilion for the trade fair in Lyon\n\n1922-23\n\nLegiobanka building, Prague-Nové Město\n\n1922-24\n\nMasaryk Square, Hradec Králové\n\n1924-25\n\nbuilding plan of Hradec Králové\n\n1924-1927\n\nschool building campus, Hradec Králové\n\n1925\n\nCzechoslovak Pavilion at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, Paris\n\nHouse of Agricultural Enlightenment, Prague-Vinohrady\n\n1928-1930\n\nChurch of St. Wenceslas, Prague-Vršovice\n\n1932\n\nDirectorate of the Czechoslovak State Railways, Hradec Králové\n\n1932\n\nhouse of Václav and Jarmila Maule, Baba, Prague-Dejvice\n\n1933-1936\n\nhouses of Karel Kytice, Marie and Stanislav Mojžíš-Lom, and Julius Glücklich, Baba, Prague-Dejvice\n\n1934\n\nTax and District Office, Hradec Králové\n\nOtakar Med’s villa, Humpolec\n\nA stage designer, graphic artist, architect, and furniture designer. He was at the birth of the Liberated Theatre stage design. He worked briefly in Le Corbusier’s studio in Paris and, in 1936, he received a gold medal at the Triennale in Milan for Theatre Stage Setting. In 1938, he left for the USA to set up the Czechoslovak pavilion for the International Exhibition in New York and the San Francisco Exhibition. He then stayed in the USA and lectured at universities. His work was based on cubism but gradually moved towards the simplicity and versatility of functionalism. He was, above all, a pioneer in theatre constructivism. In furniture-making, he was an advocate of standard functionalist design for series production. He is the co-author of Design for Use from 1944. Together with Evžen Linhart, he designed the Lisý House in Baba.\n\n1920-1924\n\nstudied architecture, civil engineering, and ship construction at CTU in Prague\n\n1924-1939\n\narchitect, designer, and stage designer in Prague\n\n1939\n\nemigrated to the USA\n\n1940-1941\n\nlectured at the New School for Social Research in New York\n\n1941-1946\n\nlectured at the California Institute of Technology\n\n1946-1950\n\nlectured at Syracuse University\n\nSignificant Works\n\n1924-1938\n\nstage designs for prominent Czech theatres\n\n1932\n\nhouse of Marie and Emanuel Lisý (in cooperation with Evžen Linhart), Baba, Praha-Dejvice\n\n1935\n\nCzechoslovak Pavilion at the World Exhibition in Brussels\n\nAn architect, urban planner, designer of furniture and decorations, professor at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design, and architectural theoretician. He studied technical studies in Prague at both the Czech and German schools, as well as at the Academy of Art in Vienna. He worked with Josef Gočár at Jan Kotěra’s studio. His works go through several distinct phases: his first period is consciously focused on modernism, then he becomes the leading representative of Czech cubism. He then goes through a period of national style only to end up being entirely devoted to functionalism. He was a long-standing president of the Czechoslovak Werkbund, the main initiator of the functionalist Baba estate, and the author of Baba’s urban plans. In the Baba estate, he designed the Dovolil House as well as his own house.\n\n1899-1905\n\nstudied architecture at CTU in Prague\n\n1902-1903\n\nstudied at the German Technical High School in Prague\n\n1906-1907\n\nstudied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna with Otto Wagner\n\n1907-1908\n\ncooperated with the studio of Professor Jan Kotěra in Prague, study trips to Italy\n\n1908\n\nmember of the Mánes Union of Fine Arts\n\n1909-1910\n\nemployed in the Department of Construction of the Prague City Hall\n\n1911\n\nindependent architect in Prague\n\nmember of the Group of Fine Artists in Prague\n\n1912\n\nco-founder of the Prague Art Workshops (PUD)\n\n1914-1918\n\nmilitary service\n\n1919\n\nstate exam at the Czech Technical University in Prague\n\n1921\n\nProfessor at the Academy of Arts, Architecture, and Design in Prague\n\nmember of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts\n\n1924-1945\n\nPresident of the Czechoslovak Werkbund (SČSD)\n\n1935\n\ncorresponding member of the Moscow Academy of Architecture\n\n1936-1956\n\narchitect of Prague Castle\n\nSignificant Works\n\n1909-1910\n\nHlávka’s Bridge in Prague\n\n1911\n\nJakubec house, Jičín\n\n1912-1913\n\nreconstruction of Dr. Fára’s house, Pelhřimov\n\n1913-1914\n\nweir on the River Labe, Předměřice 1\n\n1914\n\nVilla Pick, Ljubljana\n\n1922\n\ncrematorium, Pardubice\n\n1922-1924\n\nRiunione adriatica di Sicurta, Prague-Nové Město (with Josef Zasche)\n\n1923-1924\n\nartists’ colony (villas of J.

His works are based on purism (co-founder of the “Purist Four” of the Devětsil Association) and Czech modernism, which stood in juxtaposition to the hitherto popular decorativism. Influenced by Le Corbusier, he later became an advocate of functionalism. He was a member of the ARDEV Association and Mánes Union of Fine Arts. His designs, most of which were unfortunately not implemented, combine an extraordinarily artistic dispositional creativity with structural purity and attention to detail. Together with Antonín Heythum, he designed the Lisý House in the Baba estate.\n\n1918-1924\n\nstudied architecture with Professors Rudolf Kříženecký and Antonín Engel at CTU in Prague\n\n1924-1945\n\nemployed at the Housing Authority at the Prague City Hall\n\n1946-1949\n\nDirector of the Department of Exhibitions at the Ministry of Information\n\nSignificant Works\n\n1924-25\n\nresidential block of flats, Prague-Žižkov\n\n1925\n\nresidential block of flats, Prague-Hostivař\n\n1927-1929\n\nhis own villa, Prague-Dejvice\n\n1932\n\nhouse of Marie and Emanuel Lisý (in cooperation with Antonín Heythum), Baba, Praha-Dejvice\n\n1938\n\nresidential house, Prague-Dejvice\n\n1946-58\n\ncollective house of the Stalin chemical plants, Horní Litvínov (in cooperation with Václav Hilský)\n\n1947\n\nCzechoslovak exhibition at the Triennale di Milano\n\nA pioneer of Czech functionalism, architect, theoretician, and teacher; he is one of the most prominent figures in Czech modern architecture of the interwar period, with its principles of “new architecture,” purity, truthfulness of form, and the belief that architecture is not an art but a “scientifically-based cultural task.” He soon became a harsh critic of excessive façade decoration. Bearing in mind Le Corbusier’s view of the house as a “machine for living,” he designed four houses in Baba (Heřman, Bouda, Vaváček, and Sutnar). He is the author of the palace building on Národní třída in Prague, which he designed for the Czechoslovak Werkbund in 1936, and he was also the Werkbund’s president from 1935. He also presided over the Architects’ Club and was the editor of the functionalist “Stavba” Magazine. He was a professor and later the rector of CTU in Prague.\n\n1903-1909\n\nstudied architecture with Professors Josef Schulz and Jan Koula at CTU in Prague\n\n1912-1919\n\nprofessor at the State Technical School in Pilsen\n\n1913\n\nfounding member of the Architects’ Club\n\n1920-1945\n\nprofessor at the State Technical School in Prague\n\n1920-1948\n\nPresident of the Architects’ Club\n\n1922-1939\n\neditor-in-chief of the “Stavba” Magazine\n\n1939-1971\n\neditor-in-chief of the “Architektura” Magazine\n\n1945-1970\n\nprofessor of architecture at CTU in Prague\n\n1948\n\nRector of CTU\n\nSignificant Works\n\n1928\n\nhouse at the Exhibition of Contemporary Culture in Czechoslovakia, Brno\n\n1929-1932\n\nvillas in Prague-Dejvice 1934-36\n\n1932\n\nhouses of Iška and Ladislav Sutnar, František Heřman, Cyril Bouda and Karla and Gustav Vaváček, Baba, Prague-Dejvice\n\n1934-1936\n\nHouse of Art Industry on Národní třída in Prague (in cooperation with František Zelenka)\n\n1935\n\nvilla in Prague-Braník\n\nAn architect, publicist, and progressive furniture and interior designer; a student of Pavel Janák at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design. As a member of the Czechoslovak Werkbund, she subscribed to the ideology of modern architecture: purposefulness of the floor plan, simple furniture which is comfortable yet affordable, and liberation of women from unnecessary housework. She commenced a successful cooperation with the Artěl association, as well as the furniture company Spojené uměleckoprůmyslové závody (UP) in Brno. Her furniture for the Barrandov terraces (1929) was later produced in series for many years. She only designed two houses in her short life – the Balling House and Suk House in the Baba estate. She died at the age of 40 in Stockholm, where she lived with her husband, Czechoslovak ambassador Dr. Vladimír Kučera.\n\n1922-1927\n\nstudied architecture with Professors Karel Štípl, Josef Mařatka and Pavel Janák at the Academy of Arts, Architecture, and Design in Prague\n\n1928-1937\n\nindependent architect and designer in Prague\n\n1937\n\narchitect in Stockholm, where her husband Jaroslav Kučera worked as the ambassador\n\nSignificant Works\n\n1928\n\nrestaurant terrace in Barrandov, Prague\n\n1932\n\nhouses of Karel Balling and Antonia and Václav Suk, Baba, Prague-Dejvice\n\nstandard-type kitchen for Zenobie Vítězová, Přerov\n\nseveral interior furnishings and designs for private clients\n\n1933\n\nparticipation in the “Apartment” exhibition of the Czechoslovak Werkbund (SČSD) in Prague\n\n1934\n\nhouse in Dobřichovice\n\nAn architect, painter, interior and furniture designer, theoretician, and teacher; a student of Josef Gočár at the Prague Academy of Fine Arts. During his stay in France, Germany, and the Netherlands, he was interested in functionalist buildings, Bauhaus architecture, and Dutch rationalism. Three exceptional houses in Baba (Zaorálek, Herain, and Čeněk) marked the culmination of his functionalist work in which he applied the functionalist principles: a free floor plan, large rooms connected to outdoor sundecks, bright façades, and strip windows. His work also shows characteristics of the nautical (cabin-like) style: rounded shapes of buildings and windows. For example, he put a captain’s bridge on the roof of the Herain villa. Even his interiors and furniture displayed functionalist and purist characteristics. Following a falling-out with the builders, he focused on landscape architecture and urban planning, which he summarised in the publication Obytná krajina (1947).
