        "text": "The 90-minute film is based on interviews with Lida Baarova, one of the first and greatest Czech film stars, whose fame started in1930´s in Czechoslovakia and continued in Germany and Italy. Treštíkova visited her in 1995 in Salzburg, where she lived at the time, and talked to her for four days about her dramatic life.\n\nBaarová is known for her love affair with Joseph Goebels, the German minister of propaganda before and during WWII, when Baarová was working for the major German film producer of the time, UFA. After the war and liberation, Baarová returned to Czechoslovakia and was imprisoned by the new Czechoslovak regime as a state enemy and collaborator. She finally managed to flee to Austria, where she lived till her death in 2000. She acted in many Czech films by the best filmmakers of the time, including Martin Frič, Otakar Vávra and František Čáp. She cooperated with great directors in Germany and Italy as well, including Federico Fellini.\n\nThe makers of the documentary used rare archive materials never publically shown before from several European film archives, including the Czech National Film Archive.\n\nThe editor and co-director of the film is Jakub Hejna, cinematography is by Martin Kubala, Jan Malíř and Jiří Chod. The film was produced by Hana Třeštíková and coproduced by Czech Television and supported by the State Cinematography Fund.\n\nProduction information:"
