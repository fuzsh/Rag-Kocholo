        "text": "I Vitelloni is a 1953 Italian comedy-drama directed by Federico Fellini from a screenplay by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano, and Tullio Pinelli. The film launched the career of Alberto Sordi, one of post-war Italy’s most significant and popular comedians, who stars with Franco Fabrizi and Franco Interlenghi in a story of five young Italian men at crucial turning points in their small town lives. Recognized as a pivotal work in the director’s artistic evolution, the film has distinct autobiographical elements that mirror important societal changes in 1950s Italy. Recipient of both the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion in 1953, and an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing in 1958,[3] the film’s success restored Fellini’s reputation after the commercial failure of The White Sheik (1952).\n\nPlot\n\nAs summer draws to a close, a violent downpour interrupts a beach-side beauty pageant in a provincial town on the Adriatic coast. Sandra Rubini (Leonora Ruffo), elected “Miss Siren of 1953”, suddenly grows upset and faints: rumours fly that she’s expecting a baby by inveterate skirt chaser Fausto Moretti (Franco Fabrizi). Under pressure from Francesco (Jean Brochard), his respectable father, Fausto agrees to a shotgun wedding. After the sparsely attended middle-class ceremony, the newlyweds leave town on their honeymoon.\n\nUnemployed and living off their parents, Fausto’s twenty-something[4] friends kill time shuffling from empty cafés to seedy pool halls to aimless walks across desolate windswept beaches. During the interim, they perform immature pranks. Taunting honest road workers from the safety of a luxury car they never earned, they’re given a sound thrashing when it runs out of gas.\n\nMoraldo Rubini (Franco Interlenghi), Sandra’s brother and the youngest of the five vitelloni, uncomfortably observes Fausto’s womanizing as he ponders his own existence, dreaming of ways to escape to the big city. Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini), the baritone, nourishes unrealistic ambitions to sing and act. Alberto (Alberto Sordi), the daydreamer, is supported by his mother and self-reliant sister, Olga (Claude Farell). Vulnerable and effeminate, he’s unhappy that Olga is secretly dating a married man. Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste), the aspiring dramatist, writes a play that he discusses with Sergio Natali (Achille Majeroni), an eccentric stage actor he hopes will perform in it.\n\nBack from his honeymoon and settled in with Sandra, Fausto is forced to accept a job as a stockroom assistant in a religious-articles shop owned by Michele Curti (Carlo Romano), a friend of his father-in-law’s. Incorrigible, he pursues other women even in his wife’s presence.\n\nAt the annual masquerade ball, Fausto is bedazzled by the mature beauty of Giulia Curti (Lída Baarová), his employer’s wife. Alberto, in drag and half-drunk, executes a surrealistic dance across the ballroom floor with a goofy carnival head made of papier-mâché. Returning home at dawn, Alberto is devastated to find his sister running off for good with her married lover. Fausto’s naive attempt to seduce Giulia results in his being humiliated and then fired by her husband. In revenge, he steals the statue of an angel in gold paint from his former employer, enlisting the loyal Moraldo to help him sell it to a monk. Suspicious, the monk turns down the offer. Fausto ends up giving the statue to a simple-minded peasant (Silvio Bagolini) who sets the angel on a mound outside his hovel, admiring it from afar.\n\nOne evening after a variety show, Leopoldo agrees to accompany old Sergio for a walk along the seashore to discuss the merits of his play but when the actor propositions him, he takes to his heels in horror. Learning of Fausto’s one-night stand with an actress, Sandra runs away from home, taking the baby with her. Riccardo, Alberto, Leopoldo, and Moraldo all join in Fausto’s desperate search to retrieve his wife and child. When they find her at the home of Fausto’s father, Francesco pulls off his belt in a rage and finally whips his son. Later Fausto and Sandra walk home happily, with optimism about their life together. Resolved to abandon the provincial monotony of his dead-end town, Moraldo boards the train for anyplace else (Rome), imagining his vitelloni friends sleeping their lives away.\n\nCast\n\nFranco Interlenghi as Moraldo Rubini\n\nAlberto Sordi as Alberto\n\nFranco Fabrizi as Fausto Moretti\n\nLeopoldo Trieste as Leopoldo Vannucci\n\nRiccardo Fellini as Riccardo\n\nLeonora Ruffo as Sandra Rubini, Moraldo’s sister\n\nJean Brochard as Francesco Moretti, Fausto’s father\n\nClaude Farell as Olga, Alberto’s sister\n\nCarlo Romano as Signore Michele Curti\n\nLída Baarová as Signora Giulia Curti\n\nEnrico Viarisio as Signore Rubini, Moraldo’s father\n\nPaola Borboni as Signora Rubini, Moraldo’s mother\n\nArlette Sauvage as mysterious women at the cinema\n\nSilvio Bagolini as simple-minded peasant\n\nVira Silenti as Gisella\n\nMaja Nipora as Caterina, the soubrette\n\nWriting\n\nHaving completed an early version of La Strada with co-screenwriter Tullio Pinelli in 1952, Fellini offered their “modern fairy tale” to producer Luigi Rovere with whom he was still under contract. Rovere had solid reasons for turning it down: apart from the script of La Strada being an unrecognizable genre, Fellini’s last film, The White Sheik, was a critical and commercial flop. In a show of soldarity, Rovere loaned the script to a Venetian professor of calligraphy turned film producer, Lorenzo Pegoraro, who had admired The White Sheik. Convinced that La Strada would never attract an audience, Pegoraro requested that Fellini develop a comedy instead. Biographers differ as to who conceived I Vitelloni. For Tullio Kezich, it was Fellini who hit on the idea “after an afternoon-long consultation” with Ennio Flaiano.[6] For Hollis Alpert, it was Pinelli brain-storming with Fellini and Flaiano who came up “with a notion the other two liked: the pleasures and frustrations of growing up in a provincial town”. Under Fellini’s supervision, all three wrote the script rapidly, pooling together adolescent memories while inventing new ones.\n\nAwards\n\nWins\n\nVenice Film Festival: Silver Lion; Federico Fellini; 1953.\n\nItalian National Syndicate of Film Journalists: Silver Ribbon; Best Director, Federico Fellini; Best Producer; Best Supporting Actor, Alberto Sordi; 1954.\n\nNominations"
