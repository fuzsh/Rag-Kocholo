        "text": "On the streets of Nazi Germany his club foot and feeble, polio-weakened frame earned him the scathing nickname, the \"poison dwarf\".\n\nBut now a new academic biography has shown how Joseph Goebbels, despite his physical shortcomings, was an unlikely Casanova - recording his sexual conquests on 30,000 sheets of paper that made up his diaries.\n\nThe man who became Adolf Hitler's propaganda chief is also revealed as a mawkish sentimentalist. \"How deep and totally did I get to know her!\" he wrote of one of his early romantic encounters. \"Blessed days. Only love. Perhaps the happiest time of my life.\"\n\nBy the time Goebbels had emerged as one of the most influential figures of the Third Reich, his sexual appetite and fondness for exploiting the opportunities presented by the propaganda ministry's film-making division earned him another nickname among the actresses who frequented its casting couch: the ram.\n\nIn his 912-page study, Joseph Goebbels: Biography, Peter Longerich, a German academic and history professor at the University of London, has delved into rarely-accessed material from his subject's diaries, which span 30 years, to paint a remarkable portrait of the man who became one of Hitler's most trusted lieutenants.\n\nSo great was Goebbels' devotion to his leader that when the end of the Third Reich came he followed Hitler's example by committing suicide in the Nazis' Berlin bunker along with his wife, Magda - after first ensuring that their six children were murdered, one by one, with a combination of sedative and cyanide.\n\nThe book, published in Germany, examines Goebbels not just as the propaganda genius behind Hitler but as the depraved, sexually obsessed, sentimental and manipulative individual he really was.\n\nAged just 16, the apparently unremarkable son of a factory worker was overcome by desire for the stepmother of one of his schoolfriends. \"Eros awoke,\" he wrote in 1912. \"Sentimental period. Bombastic letters, poems. Besides which, love for mature women.\"\n\nThat passion was unrequited. But two years later, as legions of German marched to war for the Kaiser and he grew embittered that his handicap meant he would never be able to join them, a girl called Lena Krage helped ease his torment. \"The first kiss on Garden Street!\" he wrote. \"At night in the Kaiser Park - I kissed her breast. She experienced for the first time what it was like to be a loving woman.\"\n\nBack in Rheydt, his home town, he embarked on an affair with Else Janke, a young teacher. \"Quiet, platonic love,\" he wrote, as if he were really the poet he dreamed of being. \"I don't know why she doesn't want our relationship to be out in the open.\"\n\nThen, on a day that proved pivotal for their relationship, Janke told Goebbels that her mother was Jewish. In an ominous foretaste of what was to come for the whole of Europe, he noted: \"She told me her roots. Since then her charms were destroyed for me.\"\n\nIt was, according to Prof Longerich, the clearest sign of how Goebbels' was thinking. \"Until this time he had not shown particular interest in the 'Jewish Question'. But as the German Reich sunk deeper into the crisis of the 1920s, he belonged to the many who wanted to make the Jews responsible for the catastrophe.\"\n\nAs he climbed the ladder of Nazi politics, the tempo of his lust increased. Xenia, Charlotte, Erika, Julia - the conquests mounted up as fast as the countries that his Fuehrer would soon be overrunning.\n\nIn 1930 at a Nazi rally he met Magda Quandt, who had originally married into the family that would go on to found the BMW car empire but was now a divorcee - and became his wife and soulmate throughout the Third Reich.\n\nAfter they spent their first night together he wrote: \"In the evening Magda Quandt came and stayed for a very long time. She bloomed in her bewitching-blonde sweetness. How you are my queen!\" He wrote the figure one next to her name, indicating that they had made love for the first time. The figures rapidly climbed into double digits.\n\nAlthough they married in 1931, Goebbels was incapable of fidelity. His elevation to Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, which gave him total control of the communications media - radio, press, publishing, cinema and the other arts - also gave him access to fresh conquests.\n\nAs the biggest film director of the Reich, his was the biggest casting couch. His wife tolerated his innumerable dalliances, believing that he would never leave her - though her nerve was tested by his best-known and most cherished affair, with the Czech actress Lida Baarova.\n\nAs a leading proponent of Nazi racial theories - despite his own physical shortcomings - Goebbels courted Hitler's anger through his lengthy involvement with this \"inferior\" Slav, whom he lavished with gifts and attention.\n\nWith the outbreak of war and the demands of serving at Hitler's side steadily grew, the tempo of Goebbels' sex life slowed down.\n\nProf Longerich believes that the bond between Goebbels and his wife could never be broken as long as Hitler was alive, so great was their shared fanaticism.\n\nAs the Red Army fought its way into Berlin, Hitler and is new bride Eva Braun killed themselves on April 30 1945. It was Magda who decided that the Goebbels' children - all of whose names began with H in honour of their leader - should be drugged and murdered. Afterwards, Goebbels shot her and then shot himself. Their partially burned remains were found by the invading army and photographed for the world to see.\n\nThe book has received warm reviews in Germany and an English language version is planned in the near future - demonstrating the continued fascination, 65 years later, with the limping Nazi."
