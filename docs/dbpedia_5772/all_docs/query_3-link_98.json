        "text": "Introduction: When I was studying Bengali literature at the university town of Shantiniketan, in the arid and sunny district of Birbhum, West Bengal, I was living in the rural outskirts close to a village that is densely populated by Bauls. I soon started to appreciate and learn Baul songs from the musicians who lived in the surrounding area. Among the songs the performers were teaching me, many bore the bhaṇitā of Bhaba Pagla (1902 - 1984): a songwriter and spiritual teacher from East Bengal.2 The name of this composer appeared again and again, not only in the last couplets of the songs performed, but also in the Bauls' personal life stories; for instance, many Bauls used to pay regular visits, or even permanently resided, at the ashram of Kalna (Bardhaman), where Bhaba Pagla spent most of his life on the Indian side of Bengal;3 numerous Baul singers and practitioners took initiation with the mantra Bhaba Pagla used to give, either from him directly or from his eldest disciples. Most of the Bauls respect Bhaba Pagla as a mahājan, an enlightened teacher, and publicly show their devotion by displaying Bhaba Pagla’s image on the top of their ektārā (the one-stringed instrument that is peculiar to Baul music). Travelling around and visiting various gatherings of Bauls and Fakirs, such as the annual melās at Agradwip, Sonamukhi, Jaydev, Sriniketan, and a number of smaller fairs and Baul performances, I soon realised that in the oral repertoire of songs stored in the performers' memory, Bhaba Pagla's songs have a very consistent presence, and indeed constitute a central part of it. Together with the lyrics of Lalok Fakir, Gurucand Gosain, Duddu Shah, Haripad Gosain and many more named and anonymous masters of the tradition, Bhaba Pagla's compositions permeate the landscape of the orature transmitted and played by the itinerant minstrels of Bengal. In an article by Manas Ray and Suparna Tat (2006), a sample survey – probably too small and contextually confined to be of any analytical significance – on the authorship of the songs performed by Bauls shows that four songs out of twenty bore the name of Bhaba Pagla. It would probably be hyperbolic to state that the majority of the songs of the Bauls, a tradition that embraces a multitude of lineages distributed on a territory that could be as big as the old undivided Bengal, appear to have been authored by a single padakartā. It is undeniable though that songs like Gān-i sarbaśreṣṭha sādhanā (Singing is the most excellent practice for self-realisation), Nadī bharā ḍheu (The river is full of waves), Kāli balo manṭi āmār (My heart, repeat Kali's name), and many others, unavoidably belong to the oral repository of any Baul, notwithstanding his origins and his lineage (paramparā), and there is no public concert or music session among the Bauls of West Bengal in which Bhaba Pagla's name does not resonate. In striking contrast to the pervasive presence of Bhaba Pagla's works in the oral milieu of Bengali devotional and esoteric songs, the written references are scarce and confusing. The secondary sources and the academic literature available on Bauls and Fakirs – an extensively discussed topic in the field of Bengali folklore and folk literature to which a consistent number of publications has been dedicated - rarely cite Bhaba Pagla's songs. Even in the anthologies and in the collections of Baul songs that appeared in the last fifty years, it is surprising to notice that the inclusion of Bhaba Pagla's compositions is almost non existent. Apart from the few selections of songs, collected by his devotees, that have been privately published, and circulate among followers and initiates who can purchase them at the temporary stalls in front of the temples when some festive occasion occurs, the widespread circulation of Bhaba Pagla's songs in the oral literature is not reflected in the vast written (academic as well as popular) literature available on Bauls and Fakirs. The extraordinary absence of Bhaba Pagla attracted my curiosity and led me to a more in-depth study of the circumstances in which local scholarship on Bauls has developed, and of the way in which Bhaba Pagla came to be known and represented by both local practitioners and scholars. How can we explain Bhaba Pagla's absence in the Baulsphere as it has been represented in printed texts?4 How has his work been discussed in the available references? How do his disciples interpret this exclusion? Supported by data and evidence, both oral and written, that I gathered in the last few years, the attempt to answer these questions is just the first step of an ongoing doctoral research project on the broader issue of Bhaba Pagla's oeuvre in his performative context. The textual and contextual sources I am going to use have been collected during two years of field-work (July 2011 - August 2013) in West Bengal, in which time I recorded interviews, songs and oral teachings of Bauls, Fakirs, specialised performers of Bhaba Pagla's songs and members of his lineage, predominantly in the districts of Birbhum, Nadia, Murshidabad and Bankura."
