        "text": "Kamalātmikā Siddhānta: documented entry date, 1st december 2023.\n\ntomorrow marks three weeks of my second continuous sound exploration of the Kamalātmikā siddhānta (collection of algorithms) through @theashzero offering of Sounds of Śakti, for which @lensonearth created a series of sound containers (sensory or audio-visual blueprints) that aim to project as derivatives of the siddhānta of Veda & Tantra, in this expansion of bījā (seed) as layered on mātṛkā & Maheśvara sūtra.\n\nin embarking on experimentation with another wavelength, i decided not to choose one consciously with the intention to not allow any bias inferred by my programmed sense projections to influence my decision process & ulterior experience. i therefore randomly clicked on a sound, and followingly listened to it every morning and every evening, generally 4-5 times each. in the morning, after drinking espresso as sacrament, in the evening, after imbibing single malt as sacrament.\n\nalthough i aimed to approach this exploration with complete freshness & to renounce any prior knowledge or expectation, there was some linearity around having explored with one ‘different’ sound already. however, the awareness of another sound quickly faded. when listening, there was no ‘other’ sound i had explored with – the sound was complete in itself. the experiences that sprang from the sound were complete in themselves. further, it would be futile to try to compare my experiences with the two sounds – in fact, it would be futile to even try to compare my experiences with the same sound in-between themselves, as even in a round of listening consecutively to one, each listening was distinct yet not separate as well as complete, with the ear picking on different frequencies, the body absorbing it in unique sensorial ways.\n\nin the first session of Sounds of Śakti, Dr. Sumit said that, although presented as a series, each Mahāvidyā is complete, and each session is complete. we approach them as a series only as a reference point, but there is no need to approach the Mahāvidyās as such if you connect with one in completeness. my recent sound exploration offered an experiential glimpse into this.\n\nas a final observation that i aim to make without assigning validations of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ to the process, looking back to the last 7 weeks, i have spontaneously made very different or ‘new’ choices in the realm of resources / resourcefulness or ārtha, which the Kamalātmikā siddhānta taps into.\n\nBagalāmukhī Siddhānta: documented entry date, 29th of december 2023.\n\ni have been exploring the siddhantā {collection of algorithms} of the Mahāvidyā Bagalāmukhī for about one month now, through audio-visual blueprints {sound & images encoded through the algorithm of varṇa – svara -vyañjana} & colour spectrum {that of the sky} for about one month now, stimulating my brain with these tools at dawn & dusk every day, and my experience has been one of synaesthesia.\n\nsynaesthesia occurs when input received by the system which is linearly correlated with one sense stimulates more than that one sense, or stimulates the sense that is not customarily associated with said input. for example, you look at an image, and you “hear” it; the most common experience of people who have synaesthesia is that of hearing colour. in fact, this is the case of a close friend, who sees letters as colours, and i documented her experience in an article written for Plic, o revista nine years ago. back then, i was relating to her experience as an abstract, almost esoteric one, and wrote about it as such; as a foreign curiosity. i thought that you were either born with this neurological make-up or you were not.\n\nexperimenting on the AshZero platform opened my senses to experiencing synaesthesia, and to therefore experiencing input (such as colour, sound & visuals) in a multi-faceted fashion that seeped into all five senses. it made me reflect that my initial postulation of “you either have it or you don’t” was a limited one, and such an opening of the senses rests on technicality rather than on abstraction, while the potential to do so, which ultimately is to tap into different parts of the brain that are closed to us due to the linearity we entrench ourselves in, exists in all of us.\n\ntools created by: Dr. Sumit Kesarkar || platform: AshZero || offering: Sounds of Śakti || my friend who accepted to be the subject of my study years ago: @radatreispe ❤️‍🔥.\n\nImage Credit: AshZero.\n\ni turned 25 in the Himālayas, on the resplendent Khaliya trek, and camped in a remote meadow that can only be described as the land of the apasāras.\n\nhiking, i reflected on 24, which was the year of the great heartbreak: of fierce grace. the path burned through what i had worshipped as truth and held most dear, and violently pushed me to transform.\n\non last year’s pilgrimage to the Himālayas, i had prayed on a trek to Gomukh: “free me. i will do whatever it takes.” when the whatever it took came, it was not what i had imagined, and it broke my heart. i had thought i had known heartbreak, but all paled before the pain of facing the untruths i had clung to under the name of God. seeing through your own deceptions is a harsh business.\n\nas the projections i had built my spiritual life around began crumbling, i was left feeling disillusioned, and i was tempted to renounce my search for God. one of the darkest nights of the soul of 24 was one of doubt, in which i doubted everything. i bitterly cursed my trust, and felt repulsed by the dynamics of modern spirituality. i reasoned, if such power dynamics can be built on spiritual teachings, then the teachings must be false.\n\nand yet my intuition, which i had cut myself off from, arose gently; a tiny voice silently telling me that the truth i was seeking does exist. it is pulsing underneath the mirage. my intuition told me not to close myself. to trust the play and uncover the teachings. to keep moving and follow the energy.\n\ndiving deep into disillusionment paradoxically opened my system to increasing expansion as well as to a love of an encompassing nature that i had not tasted before.\n\nfollowingly, one thing i have experienced, is this: freedom rests in autonomy on the spiritual path. the teachings, the dimensions of God, such as the Mahāvidyās, the Devas and Devīs, are real – only not in the way we tend to think about them and not in the way they are taught in modern spirituality. you have to experience them for yourself. you are intrinsically worthy of it. keep moving.\n\nmy motto for 25 is: whatever it takes.\n\ni have been exploring the algorithm of the Mahāvidyā Kamalātmikā through sound pathway as facilitated by the AshZero offering of “Sounds of Śakti” for which @lensonearth created a series of sounds distilled from bījā mantra. the sounds are not chants nor articulated resonance; instead, they are what we see as a container through which sound is projected as shape. this model of absorption is a near non-linear oral transmutation which aims to follow the siddhānta (algorithm) of ṛṣi darśanāta (to understand more, watch “Vedas: All You Wanted to Know” by Dr. Kesarkar which expounds on how the Vedas originated from sound: https://youtu.be/mK6KdrmyOcg?si=t7vuad5g9kiLXCyF).\n\nafter experimenting with various abstract sound combinations for a week, i began continuously looping through one particular waveform.\n\nwith the awareness that it is in our humanness to prefer what is amiable and to make choices (such as that of which sound to absorb) based on what resonates with our sense projections, i aimed to renounce any bias and to absorb the sound for 3 weeks without expectations, familiarity or target. i listened to it in the morning and in the evening, 4 times each round.\n\ngradually, the sound became integrated in my system; i became able to access it spontaneously, in the sensory exchanges occurring in my regular days. i noticed change in my perception of the events arising in my life as well as in my actions. as instructed, i aimed to avoid the natural urge to linearly make sense of it or to differentiate positive and negative effects arising of this flow. thus, i will not pinpoint what exactly changed in my life through the means of this sound, nor do i think it would be feasible or fruitful, as it causes validation toward a process – which is not the aim of application-based Tantra.\n\nhowever, as an exercise, i decided to jot down the unfolding of a sound exploration that transpired in my first night in Rishikesh without any rationale other than an opening to the process possibly unlocking something within without a specific subconscious target.\n\ni’m not sharing this with the intention to construct a mystical halo. mystical / energetic experience is ultimately just an experience – it can greatly help us open or gain clarity, but it’s important not to get caught up in it. the experience i am sharing simply demonstrates how sound can be absorbed by the system and nothing more, and has no inherent specialness.\n\nas i sat by the Gaṅgā, the sound i have been imbibing spontaneously rang in my right ear at low volume. after a small dram of whisky taken as sacrament, the sound boomed in both of my ears. my heartbeat increased and various bodyparts, such as navel, feet and hands began pulsing. what i understand as “pleasure pathways” in my system fired. followingly, i directly listened to the sound with headphones, eyes open. after i finished listening, the sound overturned my thoughts and my experience became an immersion in the five senses (sight, touch etc).\n\nsacrament choice: 6 y/o Highland Park independent bottle, 60.1%, which i got from Cadenhead’s at a Whiskybaba.in immersion in summer – i’m not a fan of OB (original / official bottling) of Highland Park but their IB (independent bottling) i think is a must try. 🙂\n\nmother, my mother,\n\nmay your piercing hum shatter my chest\n\nand imbibe my being with radiance.\n\nmother, my mother,\n\nmay my eyelids burn at the sight of your lustrous sword,\n\nand may my tears bathe the soles of your feet.\n\nmother, my mother,\n\nyou are the darkness of the night sky\n\nand the golden stars that gleam through.\n\none glimpse of you,\n\nand i am humbled\n\nbefore the blissful truth\n\nthat all that i am\n\nand all that is\n\nis dribble\n\ngliding on your tongue.\n\ni am so, so very honoured to have my poem included in the introduction to my beloved teacher’s upcoming course, accompanying the spellbinding art created by the incredibly talented Rashmi / Rashmi Thirtha Sacred Arts Studio the wisdom Dr. Kavitha Chinnaiyan imparts in her courses is exquisite and authentic. each time i listen to her, i feel my heart cracking open, bit by bit, to the vidyā flowing through. Kavithaji offers direct applications for one’s life: thus, the teaching does not remain an esoteric, abstract concept – the shift occurs instantly. i highly recommend her courses & her work to all sādhakas!\n\nKavithaji’s mesmerising words:\n\n“It was the autumn Navarātra of 2015. I got out of the car and began walking. It was a clear night and I had been meditating on Tārā all day. It had been a day of alternating turmoil and bliss, both evoked by deep meditation. When I looked up at the star-studded sky, my legs suddenly stopped working. As if paralyzed, I stood on the sidewalk, staring at the sky. In the profound silence of that moment, the life purpose I had so ardently sought became clear. The path opened up before me… and also the obstacles that stood in my way – my self-deceptions and the demons of my own making. In retrospect, it was a defining moment, which would lead me to my guru. Like all the other Mahāvidyās, Tārā is fierce and her sādhanā is uncompromising. Her supreme vidyā is that of the Śabda Brahman. And of course, tārā also means star – how serendipitous…This Navarātra (February 17-21, 2021), we will throw ourselves at her feet, and implore her to show us the way. With her yantra as the focal point, we will explore her iconography, history, symbolism… and importantly, how she shows up in our lives. As always, this course is all about practical applications of the highest principles. We’ll see how this great goddess is constantly manifesting in our lives, our breath, our speech and our action. We will learn to invoke her in all of these areas.”\n\nto enroll:\n\nmore information:"
