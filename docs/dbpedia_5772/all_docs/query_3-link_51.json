        "text": "Introduction\n\nRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited form of retinal degeneration, affecting nearly 1/4,000 individuals [1]. RP is caused by progressive rod photoreceptor degeneration ultimately leading to peripheral vision loss, night blindness, and, sometimes, complete blindness. Mutations in more than 50 genes have been identified to cause nonsyndromic RP, while mutations in a smaller subset of genes have been found to cause syndromic RP (i.e., RP combined with additional symptoms in other tissues/organs). Common forms of syndromic RP include Usher syndrome [2], Refsum disease [3], and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) [4]. Of these disorders, BBS is one of the most studied.\n\nGenetic mutations that trigger BBS cause defects in primary cilia biogenesis and/or function [5,6]. The primary cilium plays an important role in extracellular signal transduction in several different tissues. Thus, the loss of primary cilia or cilia dysfunction leads to several abnormalities, including truncal obesity, genital anomalies, situs inversus, polydactyly, nephropathy, and learning difficulties (in addition to RP). At the molecular level, BBS is a genetically heterogeneous disease caused by recessive mutations in several proteins involved in regulating primary cilium formation and function. To date, mutations in 16 genes have been implicated in causing BBS [4]. These mutations are primarily found in genes that encode for the BBSome complex (BBS1-2 [BBS1 - Gene ID: 582, OMIM 209901; BBS2 - Gene ID: 583, OMIM 606151], BBS4-5 [BBS4 – Gene ID: 585, OMIM 600374; BBS5 – Gene ID: 129880, OMIM 603650], BBS7-9 [BBS7 – Gene ID: 55212, OMIM 607590; BBS8 – Gene ID: 123016, OMIM 608132; BBS9 – Gene ID: 27241, OMIM 607968]) [6], which is responsible for organizing cilogenesis and cilium maintenance, or the BBS chaperonin complex (MKKS/BBS6 [Gene ID: 8195, OMIM 604896], BBS10 [Gene ID: 79738, OMIM 610148], BBS12 [Gene ID: 166379, OMIM 610683]) [7]). Mutations in MKKS/BBS6 have also been identified in patients with McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS) [8] and Meckel syndrome [9]. These syndromes are generally less severe than BBS but, nonetheless, share key diagnostic features, including polydactyly and hydrometrocolpos (fluid-filled vaginal cavity) [8]. During early childhood, it is difficult to make a clinical diagnosis with any certainty whether a patient presenting with polydactyly and slight obesity has BBS or MKKS [10]. The distinction between BBS and MKKS becomes more clear only as the affected individual ages and develops additional phenotypes indicative of one or the other syndrome.\n\nA prominent, defining feature of BBS that makes it unique when compared to similar syndromes such as MKKS or Meckel syndrome is the development of RP. Given that photoreceptors are comprised of highly complex, dense stacks of sensory cilia in the form of outer segments, it is no surprise that photoreceptor degeneration is a hallmark of several ciliopathies [11]. Mutations to critical ciliary-regulating proteins involved in the trafficking of the components of outer segments results in the accumulation of rhodopsin in the inner segment and eventual photoreceptor cell death [12,13], causing peripheral vision loss, tunnel vision, and, potentially, blindness. At the heart of the primary cilia in the photoreceptor cell is the BBS chaperonin complex [7]. This complex consists of three chaperonin-like BBS proteins (MKKS/BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12) along with six chaperonin-containing TCP-1/TCP-1 ring complex (CCT/TRiC) proteins and is required for the proper formation of the BBSome complex [7,14]. In turn, the BBSome is required for protein and vesicle trafficking along the microtubules and primary cilium function [15,16]. Due to the reliance of the BBSome assembly on the proper formation of the BBS chaperonin complex, mice lacking Bbs6 as well as human patients who have MKKS/BBS6, BBS10, or BBS12 mutations phenotypically resemble mice and humans with defects in BBSome genes [17-20]. However, mutations in one particular BBS chaperonin gene, MKKS/BBS6, seem to give rise to several phenotypically variable, yet similar, syndromes [8,9,21]. Thus, it is apparent that mutations in genes encoding for BBS proteins do not always cause BBS but instead may cause syndromes that phenotypically overlap with BBS [8,10,22].\n\nHerein, we describe a pair of siblings from a consanguineous Indian family who display RP and polydactyly in the absence of other findings typically found in ciliopathies. We have discovered that both patients share a novel homozygous c.1184A>G missense mutation in the MKKS/BBS6 gene that results in a H395R substitution in the MKKS/BBS6 ciliary protein. Furthermore, this mutation reduces the interaction between MKKS/BBS6 and another important ciliary protein in the BBS chaperonin complex, BBS12. To our knowledge, this novel missense mutation is the first reported mutation in the MKKS/BBS6 gene and one of only a handful of known mutations to result in the limited form of BBS that includes RP and polydactyly [23-26].\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe report a mutation in the MKKS/BBS6 gene that causes only RP and polydactyly without other common BBS/MKKS findings, such as obesity, hydrometrocolpos, heart disease, or nephropathy. Given the poor scholastic performance of both siblings, we cannot rule out a subtle learning disability as part of the H395R mutation phenotype. Several independent groups have found that patients with the M390R mutant in BBS1 appear to have a less severe form of BBS that may include only retinal dysfunction and polydactyly [24,25,34]. Another study found that mutations in C8orf37, which encodes for a separate ciliary protein, cause a similar RP/polydactyly phenotype in the absence of additional findings associated with primary ciliary defects [23]. These reports, combined with our observations regarding the H395R mutation, reaffirm the general observations that BBS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with mutations resulting in a wide spectrum of phenotypic clinical features [8,22].\n\nWe found that the H395R mutation reduced the ability of MKKS/BBS6 to bind to another component of the BBS chaperonin complex, BBS12, in HEK-293T cells and to a lesser extent in ARPE-19 cells. Although these data suggest that this novel mutation likely disrupts the proper formation of the BBS chaperonin complex and is disease-causing, it is still unknown whether the extent to which mutant MKKS/BBS6 binds to BBS12 impacts disease severity. For example, it is not clear whether patients with a T57A MKKS/BBS6 mutation that markedly disrupts MKKS/BBS6 interactions [7] develop a wider spectrum of BBS-related findings or present with greater disease severity or an earlier age than patients with less disruptive L227P [7] or H395R mutations. We cannot rule out the possible role of secondary disease modifying the genes. However, we speculate that the H395R mutation is a hypomorphic mutation that is differentially tolerated depending on the cell type in which the mutation is expressed. Ultimately, we propose that the H395R mutation disrupts ciliary function and/or biogenesis to result in a less severe BBS phenotype that includes RP and polydactyly."
