        "text": "This work is in the public domain in India because its term of copyright has expired.\n\nThe Indian Copyright Act applies in India to works first published in India. According to the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, as amended up to Act No. 27 of 2012 (Chapter V, Section 25):\n\nAnonymous works, photographs, cinematographic works, sound recordings, government works, and works of corporate authorship or of international organizations enter the public domain 60 years after the date on which they were first published, counted from the beginning of the following calendar year (i.e. as of 2024, works published prior to 1 January 1964 are considered public domain).\n\nPosthumous works (other than those above) enter the public domain after 60 years from publication date, counted from the beginning of the following calendar year.\n\nAny kind of work other than the above enters the public domain 60 years after the author's death (or in the case of a multi-author work, the death of the last surviving author), counted from the beginning of the following calendar year.\n\nText of laws, judicial opinions, and other government reports are free from copyright.\n\nThe Indian Copyright Act, 1957 is not retroactive, so any work in which copyright did not subsist when it commenced did not have its copyright restored, and is in the public domain per the Copyright Act 1911.\n\nYou must also include a United States public domain tag to indicate why this work is in the public domain in the United States.\n\nNote that this work might not be in the public domain in countries that do not apply the rule of the shorter term and have copyright terms longer than life of the author plus 60 years. In particular, Mexico is 100 years, Jamaica is 95 years, Colombia is 80 years, Guatemala and Samoa are 75 years, and Switzerland and the United States are 70 years.\n\nThis work is in the public domain in the United States because it was published (or registered with the U.S. Copyright Office) before January 1, 1929.\n\nPublic domain works must be out of copyright in both the United States and in the source country of the work in order to be hosted on the Commons. If the work is not a U.S. work, the file must have an additional copyright tag indicating the copyright status in the source country.\n\nNote: This tag should not be used for sound recordings.PD-1923Public domain in the United States//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ram_Prasad_Sen.jpg"
