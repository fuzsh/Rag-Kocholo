        "text": "book excerptise: a book unexamined is wasting trees\n\nRamprasad: the melodious mystic\n\nSwami Budhananda\n\nBudhananda, Swami;\n\nRamprasad: the melodious mystic\n\nRamakrishna Vedanta Centre, 1982, 69 pages\n\nISBN 8175052406\n\ntopics: | biography | hindu | religion | music | | |\n\ninterestingly, this book, which is meant for the non-bengali, has the song titles (first lines) cited in devnAgari script. however, providing the full songs would also have been of interest.\n\nthe translations are however rather pedestrian. i wish they would move better.\n\nthe biography is a religious text, and it would be a mistake to expect a secular tale separate from all the legends.\n\nlike all legends, there are many versions, and the overall body has many self-contradictions. if rAmprasAd despises money and material wealth so much, how come he agrees to become a courtier and accepts a hundred-bighA grant of land - a rather large land grant - nearly an entire village.\n\nwas he indeed given such a large grant? did he agree to become courier? it is difficult to un-layer the tale.\n\nwe have a much more sparse version in Leonard Nathan and Clinton B. Seely's introduction in (Grace and mercy in her wild hair, 1999) - a work on rAmprasAd's poems: though rAmprasAd is not shy about letting his personal feelings into his songs... we know almost nothing about his life except that he flourished in the Bengal of the 18th c. Legend has it that, as a young clerk bored with his work and suffused with devotion, he was caught filling his ledger with songs to the Mother Goddess, and was sent off, adequately subsidized by his kindly employer. Even in his death he exemplified a perfect form of worship. [When at the climax of the festival] the Goddess is immersed in the waters, the poet is said to have followed her under, singing lyrics he composed to elicit her grace. Ramprasad Sen (ca. 1718-1775) [cvr/budhananda-ramprasad-cvr-h300.jpg]\n\nExcerpts\n\nmahArAjA kriShNachandra's affection\n\none of [rAmprasAd's] habits was to stand neck-deep in the gangA and continue to sing loudly song after song in his powerful voice. these songs, surging up from the hridaya-gangA of rAmprasAd, would mingle with the sweet murmur of the Ganga itself and fill the atmosphere drawing local people in numbers to the banks. it is said that once, while cruising on the ganga, mahArAjA krishnachandra of navadvIp was so charmed to hear rAmprasAd's songs that he waited in his boat for a long time until rAmprasAd had finished his devotions. krishnachandra [was] a great patron of talent. his court was adorned by poet bharatachandra, by agamavAgisa, the great tAntrik sAdhaka, and by gopal bhnAR, the court jester.\n\ndespising money\n\nkrishnachandra respectfully approached rAmprasAd and suggested that he too might come and adorn his court. what was the reaction of rAmprasAd at this windfall which would solve material problems of his life for ever? was rAmprasAd beside himself with joy at this sudden stroke of good luck? no, he felt as though struck by a thunderbolt. how could one in whose heart the mother of the universe was enthroned think of becoming a courtier? humbly and gracefully rAmprasAd declined the offer of the maharaja, who in turn grew all the more respectful at the blazing renunciation of this young aspirant. [/cvr] one may recall here how, when lakShminArAyaN mArwAri offered to make an endowment of ten thousand rupees for personal expenses, sri rAmakrishna fell unconscious as if struck on the head. strange men these, who were mad with love of the divine mother! the values of the world were no values to them. but maharaja krishnachandra was not to be easily put off. he persuaded rAmprasAd to accept a gift of a hundred bighas of land free of rent as the hereditary right of his family.\n\nsong : taking the name of kAli, dive in (à¦¡à§à¦¬ à¦¦à§ à¦®à¦¨ à¦à¦¾à¦²à§ à¦¬à¦²à§)\n\ntaking the name of kAli, dive deep down. o mind, into the heart's fathomless depths, where many a precious gem lies hid. but never believe the bed of the ocean bare of gems if in the first few dives you fail; à¦¡à§à¦¬ à¦¦à§ à¦®à¦¨ à¦à¦¾à¦²à§ à¦¬à¦²à§à¥¤ à¦¹à§à¦¦à¦¿-à¦°à¦¤à§à¦¨à¦¾à¦à¦°à§à¦° à¦ à¦à¦¾à¦§ à¦à¦²à§à¥¤ à¦°à¦¤à§à¦¨à¦¾à¦à¦° à¦¨à¦¯à¦¼ à¦¶à§à¦¨à§à¦¯ à¦à¦à¦¨, à¦¦à§-à¦à¦¾à¦° à¦¡à§à¦¬à§ à¦§à¦¨ à¦¨à¦¾ à¦ªà§à¦²à§, with firm resolve and self-control-- dive deep and make your way to mother kAli's realm. down in the ocean depths of heavenly wisdom lies. the wondrous pearls of peace, o mind; and you yourself can gather them, if you have but pure love and follow the scriptures' rule. à¦¤à§à¦®à¦¿ à¦¦à¦®-à¦¸à¦¾à¦®à¦°à§à¦¥à§à¦¯à§ à¦à¦à¦¡à§à¦¬à§ à¦¯à¦¾à¦, à¦à§à¦²à¦à§à¦£à§à¦¡à¦²à¦¿à¦¨à§à¦° à¦à§à¦²à§à¥¤ à¦à§à¦à¦¾à¦¨-à¦¸à¦®à§à¦¦à§à¦°à§à¦° à¦®à¦¾à¦à§ à¦°à§ à¦®à¦¨, à¦¶à¦¾à¦¨à§à¦¤à¦¿à¦°à§à¦ªà¦¾ à¦®à§à¦à§à¦¤à¦¾ à¦«à¦²à§, à¦¤à§à¦®à¦¿ à¦­à¦à§à¦¤à¦¿ à¦à¦°à§ à¦à§à¦¡à¦¼à¦¾à¦¯à¦¼à§ à¦ªà¦¾à¦¬à§, à¦¶à¦¿à¦¬à¦¯à§à¦à§à¦¤à¦¿ à¦®à¦¤à§ à¦à¦¾à¦à¦²à§à¥¤ within those ocean depths, as well, six alligators lurk--lust, anger and the rest-- swimming about in search of prey. smear yourself with the turmeric of discrimination, the very smell of it will shield you from their jaws. upon the ocean bed lie strewn unnumbered pearls and precious gems, plunge in, says rAmprasAd, and gather up handfuls there! à¦à¦¾à¦®à¦¾à¦¦à¦¿ à¦à¦¯à¦¼ à¦à§à¦®à§à¦­à§à¦° à¦à¦à§, à¦à¦¹à¦¾à¦°-à¦²à§à¦­à§ à¦¸à¦¦à¦¾à¦ à¦à¦²à§, à¦¤à§à¦®à¦¿ à¦¬à¦¿à¦¬à§à¦-à¦¹à¦²à¦¦à¦¿ à¦à¦¾à¦¯à¦¼à§ à¦®à§à¦à§ à¦¯à¦¾à¦, à¦à§à¦à¦¬à§ à¦¨à¦¾ à¦¤à¦¾à¦° à¦à¦¨à§à¦§ à¦ªà§à¦²à§à¥¤ à¦°à¦¤à¦¨-à¦®à¦¾à¦£à¦¿à¦à§à¦¯ à¦à¦¤à¦ªà¦¡à¦¼à§ à¦à¦à§ à¦¸à§à¦ à¦à¦²à§, à¦°à¦¾à¦®à¦ªà§à¦°à¦¸à¦¾à¦¦ à¦¬à¦²à§ à¦à¦®à§à¦ª à¦¦à¦¿à¦²à§, à¦®à¦¿à¦²à¦¬à§ à¦°à¦¤à¦¨ à¦«à¦²à§ à¦«à¦²à§à¥¤\n\nDub de re man kAlI bale\n\n(same song from Grace and mercy in her wild hair tr.

There are gems down there that two or three dives Aren't going to get. Now, hold your breath And jump! Kick down to where She sits Deep in the wise waters, a great pearl. You can do it, all it takes Is overwhelming love and the memory of Shiva's good words. Down there the Six Passion's cruise Like crocodiles snapping at anything That moves, so cover yourself with knowledge Like turmeric smeared on the skin-- The odor will keep them off. I tell you there's a world of wealth In that water. rAmprasAd says: Dive in And you're going to come up with a fortune.\n\nsong : now i'll devour you, kAli!

I'll eat You, I'll eat You, Oh Compassionate to the Poor. I was born under an evil star and sons born then devour their mothers. Either You eat me or I eat You: we must decide on one. I'll make a curry of Your demons and witches and boil into a soup with spices and ghee the heads from Your necklace. Your blackness I'll smear all over my hands, my face, and my limbs. When Death comes I'll blacken his face too. I say I'll eat You up but You won't fill my stomach; I'll sit You on my heart-lotus and worship You mentally. They may tell me if I eat Kali I'll get into trouble with Death, but why should I fear him? I'll shout \"Kali!\" and stick my thumb in his face. I'll make sure he understands Sri Ramprasad is Kali's son. I'll cause my death myself through mantra repetition.
