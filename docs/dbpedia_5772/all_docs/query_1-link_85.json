        "text": "March 1, 2020\n\nWhat She truly is ? This is the question great poet RÃ¡mprasÃ¡d Sen asks in one of his poems in honour of the Divine Mother in the form of MÃ¡a KÃ¡lÃ­. However, do not expect to find flowery poetic eulogies of the Divine. The poet has made us feel MotherÂ´s presence so real and down-to-Earth. He does not avoid the reality of Death, decay or depressive feelings. Mother is cruel and loving at the same time. Rendition to modern English language thanks to the efforts of Mr. Leonard Nathan and Mr. Clinton Seely make us feel Mother so approachable and close to our day-to-day lives as well.\n\nOctober 1, 2020\n\nwondrous, ecstatic!!\n\nðŸ•Š Durga's ambrosial name liberates.\n\nRepeat it without ceasing;\n\ndrench your tongue in nectar. ðŸ•Š\n\nMay 27, 2013\n\nNot always my favorite source of translations, to be honest -- these versions don't soar, revel, tease, and trouble with the full spirit of Ramprasad's songs to the Goddess. But it still remains one of the more complete collections I've found in English, and I find myself returning to it nonetheless. Recommended if you have a love for the imagery of the Bengali Goddess Kali and Her devotees, like Ramakrishna.\n\nJanuary 29, 2015\n\nI love the goddess Kali as I have been drawn to her for a year now. She is a bad-ass goddess. I think that these poems transition really nicely as in the beginning there was a lack of self-acceptance in the narrator. Later, he surrenders and that is exactly what this goddess does. I truly wish I could read these poems in the native tongue, but alas, I cannot.Kali destroys your ego. Jai Maha Kali! I salute the goddess!"
