        "text": "If you loved the recent google doodle on panipuri, we have a double treat for you. A two-hour drive down the Barrackpore-Kalyani expressway will bring you to a mediaeval town where a wealth of history and a mouth watering ancient Indian snack await you. Halisahar is a peaceful hamlet in the North 24 Parganas district, about 50 Kms from Kolkata. The name was probably derived from ‚ÄòHaveli Shahar‚Äô (City of Palaces), which is mentioned in Abul Fazal's ‚ÄòAin-i-Akbari‚Äô. While the Mughal-era palaces couldn‚Äôt withstand the ravages of time, what remains is still worth a visit. Many eminent personalities like Ishvara Puri, Sadhak Ramprasad Sen, and ‚ÄòLokamata‚Äô Rani Rashmoni called this suburban town their home. Visiting any of the Kali temples built in their memory during the last century would be a worthwhile peek into bygone eras. It is no surprise then that Kali Puja is the biggest festival here, despite the widespread popularity of Durga Puja in the state. If the historical significance has piqued your interest, wait till we tell you about the mouth-watering snack from this place. According to the Hindu mythological text Mahabharat, Kunti once gave Draupadi a very small amount of ingredients to test her resourcefulness. Draupadi used it to make small puris filled with sweet and sour tamarind water. It is said that Kunti blessed the dish with immortality, so moved was she by the flavor. Even if the story doesn‚Äôt sound very plausible, the dish did live on. ' Pani Puri,known by several different names in different regions of India, remains a popular snack in the country. ‚ÄòPhuchka‚Äô, as it‚Äôs called in Bengal, is equally popular, if not more, across all age groups. How is that relevant to Halisahar, you may wonder? Well, the majority of the phuchkas sold in Bengal come from this place. That‚Äôs right. A small area in Halisahar known as Phuchkagram (Village of Phuchka) has quietly served as the haven of everyone‚Äôs favorite snack for ages. Phuchka here comes in a wide range of varieties that might seem a bit eccentric at first,but you‚Äôll be forced to reconsider once you taste them. In addition to the classic tamarind water, you‚Äôll find phuchkas filled with fruit jam, chicken and mutton keema & even ice cream. What‚Äôs even more fascinating is that this enterprise, which sustains more than 100 households, is entirely run by women. They work around the clock, first preparing the ingredients indoors and then setting up stalls outside. The village‚Äôs location near the Rani Rashmoni Ghat and the adjacent Rani Rashmoni Temple has also boosted the income of these 100 or so women, giving them financial independence. It seems as if the spirit of Rani Rashmoni is still empowering the women of Halisahar. The recent google doodle celebrated the day in 2015 when an Indore-based restaurant set a world record by serving 51 different types of flavored water in their panipuri. Assisting them that day was Master Chef India‚Äôs Neha Deepak Shah. ...continued in comment"
