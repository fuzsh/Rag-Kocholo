All of the Sakta poems excerpted and discussed in the latter book, plus many others, are presented in full here with minimal introductions so as to create an accessible anthology that can be used, especially for undergraduate courses but also for inspirational reading. Although all of the people whom I thanked in the larger book are in some ways responsible for this book as well, here I would like to single out those whose expertise has been particularly helpful to me in the arduous but ultimately delightful task of translation. Institutionally, I am indebted to Harvard University—to Professors John B. Carman and Diana L. Eck, who supported and guided me in spite of the fact that poetry to Kali is particularly relished by neither the Sri Vaisnava nor the north Indian Saiva tradition—and to the university's Frank Knox Traveling Fellowship. Other funding that enabled me to live in Calcutta for two years and to complete my dissertation was provided by the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad grant and the Institute of International Education Fulbright award, both administered in Calcutta by Dr. Uma Dasgupta and the office of the United States Educational Foundation in India, and by the Charlotte W Newcombe Fellowship. To all of these granting agencies I am most grateful. In the years since receiving the Ph.D., during which I decided to expand the project from a narrow emphasis upon the poetry of Kamalakanta Bhattacarya to include all of the poets in the 250-year literary tradition, I extend warm thanks to Barnard College for a travel stipend and to Professor Irene Bloom, chair of my department, who graciously allowed me to rush off to Calcutta for ten days each fall, partially to consult my Sakta poetry mentors during the Kali Puja festivities. Most recently, the editors at Oxford University Press, especially Cynthia Read, Theodore Calderara, MaryBeth Branigan, and Nancy Hoagland deserve thanks for their shepherding of this book through the various stages of publication. Special gratitude goes to Margaret Case for her superb job of manuscript editing. But let me return to the poetry itself. My interest began with my parents. I remember as a child at bedtime listening to my father read out passages from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. These included Sakta poems sung to the saint by his dis-\n\nciples, which frequently sent him into an ecstatic mood. I always wanted my father to get through these poetry excerpts as fast as possible. To me they seemed full of flowery English and inscrutable meanings; I was far more interested in Ramakrishna's conversations and jokes. Ramprasad and Kamalakanta, in other words, were household names, and I thank my parents, and Swami Nikhilananda's formal English translations, for introducing me to them at such a young age. Although my husband Scott views the Sakta poetry in a light similar to that of Rachel the child, he has selflessly supported me and this project, and much credit for its completion belongs to him. In Calcutta, London, and New York, I have had several mentors and teachers, and the help of all of them stands behind and within the lines of poetry contained in this book. My Bengali teachers in Calcutta in 1988-1990, Kesabcandra Sarkar of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture and Aditi Sen of the American Institute of Indian Studies, read with me, helped familiarize me with the elliptical style of the eighteenth- to nineteenth-century Sakta poetry genre, and corrected my initial literal translations. Since 1993 I have also received help and advice, particularly in decoding language usages and images not found in any dictionary, by Hena Basu in Calcutta, Professor Partha Mitter in London, and Professors Jeffrey J. Kripal and Clinton B. Seely in the United States. However, there are two scholars whose help towers above that of everyone else, whose guidance and willingness to review and correct my work have been foundational to whatever success these Bengali-to-English translations might hope to obtain. Professors Narendra Nath Bhattacaryya of Calcutta University and Minati Kar of Visvabharati University are intellectual giants in the field of Sakta interpretation. From them I have learned as much about kindness as I have about the intricacies of Goddess-centered poetry conventions, and this book is gratefully and fondly dedicated to them.\n\nviii\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction Pathways to the Sakta Poetry: Sources, Precedents, and Influences Poets for the Goddess\n\n7\n\nFamily Resemblances: Sakta Padavall as Bhakti Poetry\n\n11\n\nThe Challenges and Choices in Designing an Anthology\n\n12\n\nNotes on Transliteration,Translation, and Word Definition\n\n14\n\nThe Poems Kali among the Corpses: Poems of Battle The Cosmic Goddess of Transformation\n\n19 38\n\nThe Magician's Daughter and Her Playful Deceptions\n\n47\n\n\"What Kind of Mother Are You?\" Cries of Complaint 52 Petitioning the Compassionate\n\n66\n\n\"Oh My Mind!\": Instructing the Self 76 Prioritizing Paths: Tantra, Devotion, and Ritual 92 The Experience of Kundalini Yoga In Defiance of Death\n\n103\n\n118\n\nAdoring the Daughter: Agamani and Vijaya Poems for Uma NOTES 153 A GUIDE TO SELECTED NAMES, TERMS, AND TEXTS 173 DISCOGRAPHY 181 INDEX OF POEMS BY AUTHOR AND FIRST LINE (ENGLISH) 183 INDEX OF POEMS BY AUTHOR AND FIRST LINE (BENGALI) 187 Photographs follow page 46\n\n123\n\n3\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nSinging to the Goddess\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nPathways to the Sakta Poetry: Sources, Precedents, and Influences The Bengali scholar SasibhusanDasgupta, in commenting upon the Goddess-centered devotional poetry tradition of Bengal, once remarked that although it was not surprising to find Uma, the lovely wife of Siva, softened and humanized by the touch of devotion, the effects of that touch upon Kali were astonishing. Who would have thought that the black Goddess of death, who decapitates her enemies and hangs their body parts from her neck and around her waist, would become the embodiment of motherly compassion and kindness?1 In part because of the dread characteristics of this Goddess, bhakti, or devotion, came late to her literary tradition. Although we have evidence of bhakti poetry to male deities such asVisnu and Siva from as early as the ninth century in south India, and although love poetry to Krsna flowered in Bengal from the fifteenth century on, it was not until the mid-eighteenth century that poets began addressing Kali in the endearing language of intimacy. The resulting genre has been named Sakta Padavali, or Collected Poems to the Goddess, and is divided into two parts, both meant to be sung, usually to instrumental accompaniment. The first, Syama-sarigita, or Songs to Syama, the Black Goddess Kali, has historically been the more popular, in terms of both composition and audience appeal. In these poems, the Goddess receives the full gamut of human emotion, for she is described, praised, blessed, petitioned, cajoled, and even threatened. The poets speak directly to Kali, trying to get her attention and secure for themselves a place at her fear-dispelling feet. By contrast, Uma-sangita, or Songs to Siva's wife Parvati, tell a story. Agamam songs, or songs about her coming, celebrate Uma's once-yearly visit from her home with Siva in Kailasa to her parents, Giriraj, the King of the Mountains, and his wife Menaka, somewhere in the Himalayas in northern Bengal. She arrives just at the commencement of the autumnal Durga Puja festivities,2 when the martial, ten-armed Durga (with whom Uma is identified) is acclaimed for her killing of the buffalo demon Mahisa. She stays for the three days of the Puja and then returns home to her husband, much\n\n3\n\nto the dismay of her parents and friends. Vijaya songs, or those sung on the last day, the day of victory (vijaya), when Durga triumphs over the demon, lament Uma's incipient departure. The Goddess as she appears in the poems of this genre has many faces, which reflect the several literary and historical phases of her Sanskrit and Bengali heritage.3 Kali or Kalika as a name derives from kala, which means \"black,\" \"time,\" and \"death\"; as such, she is the Mistress of Time or Death, the one who devours. Her history in the Mahabharata epic and mythological stories of the Puranas from the early centuries C.E. attests to this characterization; she aids other gods and goddesses in their battles against demons, and is known for her blood-lust. The most famous Puranic text to feature Kali is the sixth-century \"Devi-Mahatmya\" section of the Markandeya Purana, where she is created by the Goddess Durga or Candika to help dispatch three particularly unruly demons, Canda, Munda, and Raktavija. Although the main heroine of the text is Durga in her victories over the buffalo demon Mahisa and the two demons Sumbha and Nisumbha, Kali's successes and relationship to Durga earn her a place in the growing pantheon of goddesses. She continues to appear in Puranas through the sixteenth century, where—despite her awe-inspiring, demon-chopping activities—she is increasingly described in philosophical language as a manifestation of Sakti, feminine potency, and as the highest Brahman, the absolute ground of being. Through Kali's identification with Durga, and hence with ParvatI or Uma, she also gains \"the Auspicious Lord\" Siva as a husband; indeed, one of her most popular epithets in the Sakta poetry is Sarikari, or Wife of Sarikara (Siva). As such, Kali is allied both to the Goddess Satl, daughter of Daksa, who committed suicide in reaction to her father's insult to her husband Siva, and to Satis reincarnated form in the person of Uma, Daughter of the Himalayas, who wins Siva back through her asceticism and devotion.These stories about Satl and Uma derive at least from the time of the Mahabharata and are amplified in subsequent Sanskrit plays and Puranas. As far as epic and Puranic texts are concerned, then, it is Uma and Durga who are the most famous, the most written about. Kali wins her acceptance in this literature through her association with them. But already by the eleventh century, Kali had gained another dimension through her incorporation into Tantric texts, rituals, and philosophical speculations. Tantra as a system of texts and ideas is esoteric, for the initiated few alone, and stands upon the principle that worldly things usually considered as obstacles to spiritual advancement need not be, if properly understood and handled. Hence Tantric texts offer complicated ritual and meditation prescriptions, detailed iconographic descriptions of deities to be worshiped, and instructions on the attainment of spiritual powers. In addition, they posit the human body as a microcosm of the spiritual universe: inside are to be found all elements of the material world, all pilgrimage sites, all deities, and the beginning and end of the religious path. Through one of the most celebrated Tantric spiritual practices, kundalinf yoga, the skilled aspirant learns to raise his spiritual energy, coiled as a female serpent (kundalini] in the base of his spine, up through the six centers or cakras in the central channel of\n\n4\n\nSINGING TO THE GODDESS\n\nhis body (tnuladhara at the base of the spine, svadhisthana between the anus and penis, manipum at the navel, andhata at the heart, visuddha at the throat, and ajna between the eyebrows).4 His final destination is the seventh and last center, the sahasrara, at the top of his head (see Fig. 1).There the kundalim unites with her consort, Siva, bringing to the aspirant the nondual liberation he has been seeking. Bengali Syama-sahgita is influenced by five aspects of thisTantric context: the conviction that one need not escape from the world in order to achieve full realization; the descriptions of Kali's form, used for meditation; the hymns of praise for Kali, •which glorify her as the philosophical Absolute, the coincidence of opposites, and the font of compassion; the practice of kundalim yoga, which many of the poets follow and exhort, and from which Kali gains the epithet Kundalim; and the nameTara, the Savior, the One Who Takes (the devotee) Across (the sea of this world), one of Kali's most common names. Tara is an important goddess in Buddhist Tantra, and was probably absorbed into the Hindu pantheon and identified •with Kali sometime after the eleventh century. Although Durga in her various forms is to a lesser extent also described and worshiped in Tantric literature, Uma's place in this vast corpus is superficial. She is a stereotyped figure who, as Siva's devoted wife, questions and elicits from him instructions about Tantric rites, philosophical ideas, and meditation procedures. Whereas Kali comes to the Sakta poets imbued with a rich heritage of Tantric associations, Uma remains largely within a narrative provenance centered around her marriage and home life with Siva. Sanskrit texts are not the only foundation for the Kali and Uma of Sakta Padavali. Bengali poetry since the medieval period has also made its impression. The genre of Maiigalakavya literature, long poems celebrating the exploits of various deities, preserves the evolving notions of the Goddess. Kali does not become the subject of this genre until the seventeenth century, but when she does get incorporated—particularly in a story called \"Vidya-Sundara\" from the Kalikamahgalakavya—she emerges as a slightly capricious but compassionate figure who acts to save her devotees from ignominy. Moreover, the frightening skulls, severed arms, and glistening blood that she wears on her body are beautified by the addition of jewels and tinkling bells, details later appropriated by the poets of the Sakta Padavali tradition. Uma's place in this genre is even more important, and forms a direct link with the agamam and vijaya poems. Several Marigalakavyas, even if chiefly concerned to glorify another deity, also tell the story of Siva and Parvati, but with particularly Bengali twists. Here Siva is no handsome Lord but a goodfor-nothing old man who has to till the land for a living, and who fritters away his money in drunken sprees. Uma is unhappy with him, and her parents grieve over their son-in-law. The biggest Bengali influence upon the songs to Kali, however, is the prior but parallel poetry tradition to Krsna,Vaisnava Padavali.The Sakta poets copied the form and style of theVaisnava poems, creating short, rhyming compositions that typically conclude with a bhanita, or signature line, -where the poet inserts his name and comments upon the subject of his poem. In terms of content, as well, theVaisnava tradi-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\ntion provided models: the grim Goddess Kali is beautified with imagery very similar to that used for Krsna's lover Radha (poem 19);Vaisnava saints and pilgrimage sites are incorporated into the Saktas' internal and external sacred geographies (poems 120 and 164); and the name of Krsna—in the Bengali tradition usually Hari—is repeated reverentially in the context of devotion to the Goddess (poems 20 and 87). The influence is even more noticeable in the Uma-sariglta, where Menaka 's yearning for, love of, and fears about her young daughter Uma remind one of Yasoda's longing care for her foster-son Krsna. Indeed, most Bengali scholars believe that the Sakta poets borrowed theVaisnavas' category of vatsalya bhava (the feeling of a cow for her calf), which in the Vaisnava setting is so well exemplified by Yas'oda's attitudes toward her son, and used it to express Menaka s love for Uma. Regarding Kali, on the other hand, these scholars assert that the dominant emotion is prati-vatsalya bhava, the love a child feels toward his or her mother. Although the fact of this influence is not a matter of debate, the causes for it are. Was this incorporation of Vaisnava elements a form of flattery, indicating that the regnant tradition of devotional poetry to Krsna was so pervasive and beloved that any subsequent literary tradition had to follow in its steps? Perhaps. And yet there was also a sense of rivalry; in order for the newer Goddess cult to take hold, it had to present itself in a familiar garb, and yet argue for its ability to absorb and even supercede its predecessor. Hence the many Sakta poems that claim Kali's identification with Krsna (poems 24-27). The final source for the conceptions and images found in the Sakta Padavall is neither the Sanskrit Puranic orTantric literatures nor the Bengali genres of poetry, but local, oral sayings, linguistic forms, and attitudes toward the means of livelihood available in the mid-eighteenth to early nineteenth century. Particularly the earliest poets, Ramprasad Sen and Kamalakanta Bhattacarya, fill their compositions with references to farmers and their debts; financial managers of landed estates; merchant traders and their capital ventures; lawyers in court battles; boatmen and their leaky vessels; poor people bewailing the inequities of class and wealth; and ordinary folk enjoying themselves in annual religious festivals and various amusements. When discussing their distressing lack of devotion, they often refer to the six sins—lust, anger, greed, lethargy, pride, and envy—in homey metaphors, as the six enemies, the six thieves, the six land-diggers, the six ingredients to be added to a spiritual stew, the six fires, and the six oarsmen. More recent poets continue this trend; Kalyankumar Mukhopadhyay, for example, describes receiving the Goddess's grace in terms of a modern train journey (poem 78). The same local touches are also evident in the Uma-sarigita, where the situations of Uma with Siva and Menaka with Giriraj mirror those of married women in late-medieval to early-modern rural Bengal. A brief look at the figure of Siva—also called Sahkara and Hara, the Destroyer—reveals that he too is a multilayered individual. In many ways the Siva one encounters here in the Sakta Padavall is the Puranic Siva: the Lord of Kailasa, the ascetic married to ParvatI, Daughter of the Mountain. But he is also a Tantric deity who, in the prescribed iconographic images of Kali, lies beneath her feet as\n\n6\n\nSINGING TO THE GODDESS\n\nboth corpse and sexual partner. Moreover, his greatness is proven by the fact that he is the only one who can fathom her, and it is he who is the ultimate goal of both the kundalim and the poet-aspirant, who together rise to union with him in Tantric meditation. From such heights, the Saktas' Siva falls to moral and economic decrepitude in the Uma-sahgita, poems in direct continuity with the Bengali Maiigalakavyas. For here he is a mother-in-law's nightmare, who not only drags Uma into poverty but, in a manner reminiscent of the flirtatious Krsna, womanizes on the side. In addition to all of these aspects, none of which is discarded, the Sakta poets draw upon a late Puranic tradition that treats Siva as Kali's principal devotee.5 Willingly becoming her \"victim\" so as to have her salvation-conferring feet on his chest, Siva is the poets' father as well as their chief rival. For if they can snatch the feet away from him for themselves, they will have achieved the supreme object of their spiritual desire (poems 58, 65, and 71).\n\nPoets for the Goddess This anthology consists of 164 compositions by thirty-seven representative poets.6 Although they span over 250 years, from the mid-eighteenth century to the present, as a group they have much in common. They are mostly men (only four are women); almost all of them are twice-born, from the upper three caste groupings in Bengal; the great majority lived or live in the regions now known as West Bengal; and with only one or two exceptions they can be classed as householders, not renouncers. However, since social and political conditions, as well as sources of patronage for artistic expression, have changed considerably over the last two and a half centuries in Bengal, there is quite a variation in the relationship among these poets, their writing of Sakta lyrics, and their means of livelihood. Indeed, although some of the poets chosen for this volume appear to have done little else but write devotional poetry to the Goddess, others wrote desultorily, on a number of topics; Sakta themes form a small, if interesting, part of their overall repertoires. Again, certain poets were fortunate to be patronized by men of wealth and social standing, whose support enabled them to give up regular quotidian work. Most of the more recent poets, by contrast, have had to nurture their artistic and religious proclivities as a hobby and publish poetry volumes on their own, or they have derived such little revenue from commercially produced work that they have had to take additional jobs. For the purposes of this anthology, therefore, \"Sakta poet\" does not necessarily indicate that the person in question was a Sakta—he could have been a litterateur, whose work says nothing about his personal religious orientation—or even that he wrote primarily on Sakta topics. Why such people have been included here has everything to do with their poetry, irrespective of personal motivation: if the poetry is important in the history of the evolving Sakta Padavali genre, it merits consideration. The poets about whom biographic information is available can be divided into six very rough groups, the first three of which are contemporaries.7\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\n1. Although it is extremely difficult to determine who initiated the genre of Sakta Padavall, it is clear who paid for it and who benefited from it: the zamindars, or owners of landed estates, most of whom lived in the western regions of Bengal.8 By the mid-eighteenth century, a large number of such wealthy families had adopted Durga and Kali as their clan deities, and many scholars believe that the worship of such powerful, martial goddesses aided the zamindars in their quest for political and social prestige in a rapidly changing and unstable environment, where they had to negotiate between the rising of British ambitions and the threatened system of Mughal governance. The zamindars of Nadia, Burdwan, Dinajpur, and Rajshahi, the four biggest revenue-generating districts in Bengal, were all Sakta, patronized Sakta festivals, dabbled in the composition of Sakta lyrics, and maintained courts studded with poets, musicians, and philosophers—men whose learning and artistry reflected well on the sensibilities of their patrons. Sample poets from this category in the anthology include Sambhucandra Ray and Naracandra Ray, both of whom straddled the beginning of the nineteenth century and were born into the Nadia zamindari lineage; Maharaja Ramkrsna Ray (d. 1795), zamindar of the Rajshahi estate in the east, who saw clear linkages between Goddess worship and temporal power (see poem 12); Maharaja Nandakumar Ray (d. 1775), a patron of the arts who grew in wealth and influence under the British in Calcutta and who was renowned as both a patron of and a believer in Sakta traditions; Maharajadhiraja Mahtabcand (1825-1879), zamindar of Burdwan and a prolific writer of Sakta bhakti poetry; and Asutos Deb (1805-1856), the doyen of an important Calcutta family, who sponsored religious, literary, and cultural events in the city, as well as writing his own poems, some on Sakta themes. 2. None of the estate owners appears to have written very much poetry, however; in the main they left this to the retainers in their employ. The dewam or financial managers of several of the important aristocratic families also wrote Sakta poetry; famed Bengali examples are Dewan Raghunath Ray (d. 1836) of Burdwan, and Dewan Ramdulal Nandi (d. 1851) of Tripura. But by far the most important contributors to the entire 250-year tradition are two court poets who lived at the expense of the Nadia and Burdwan zamindars, respectively: Ramprasad Sen (ca. 1718-1775) and Kamalakanta Bhattacarya (ca. 1769-1821). They appear to have had no other mandate than to compose poetry, although Kamalakanta also served as a priest in his patrons Kali temple and tutored his patron's son. As a result, each one produced between two and three hundred Sakta poems. In addition, both are celebrated in Bengali history and legend as accomplished spiritual adepts, who combined a love of the Goddess with an expertise in Tantric practice. 3. A third group who sang on Sakta themes were professional entertainers of the mid-eighteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries who, like the poets in the second category above, were patronized by wealthy landowners inside and outside Calcutta. Unlike the dewani, and court poets mentioned above, however, they are not generally famed for their devotion or spirituality, although they may have had personal religious tendencies; rather, they are classed by Bengali commentators as performers\n\n8\n\nSINGING TO THE GODDESS\n\nwho made a living by going from one engagement to another, developing their repertoires and making a name for themselves. Usually singing in groups with orchestral accompaniment, these musicians specialized in extemporaneous composition, and often heightened the entertainment by performing with a rival group, whose wit and brilliance they attempted to outshine. Although, in terms of religious themes, such singers preferred to focus on the highly nuanced story of Radha and Krsna, with its potential for social commentary on jilted love, they did occasionally sing about Uma and Siva as well, emphasizing the sorrow of mother and daughter, or the plight of young girls. Kali, less amenable of narrative treatment, is infrequently made the subject of their songs. And when she is, it is her association with Durga and her epic and Puranic, not herTantric, heritage that are typically plumbed (see poems 43,58, and 102).The exception is Dasarathi Ray, who in addition to his longer poems on Uma and Siva also composed a number of short poems on Kali, Tantra, and devotion. Of these three have been excerpted here. Because of the oral, spontaneous nature of these performances, and because they often occurred in the open, as street entertainment, much of this poetry has been lost. However, enough has been saved through the efforts of nineteenthcentury anthologists to indicate how important their compositions were to the developing genre of Sakta poetry. Representative poets from this category include Raghunath Das (third quarter of the eighteenth century); Ram Basu (17381812); Nilmani Patuni (d. 1825); Anthony Saheb (d. 1836); Dasarathi Ray (1807-1857); Rasikcandra Ray (1820-1893); Harmath Majumdar (1833-1896); Sarada Bhandari (n.d.); and Nablncandra Cakrabarti (n.d.). 4. After the mid-nineteenth century, sources of patronage change. With the more aggressive Anglicizing programs of the British, the growing cleavage between English-educated, \"polite\" society and the folk culture of the streets, and the development of Bengali prose and drama often patterned on or in opposition to British models, a number of professional litterateurs emerged. These were men whose success was judged by the publication or public staging of their work, rather than its performance in the parlors of the rich. Again, such artists wrote on a number of varied themes, and Sakta topics assumed only a fraction of their total output. Nevertheless, because they were accomplished writers, their poetry is interesting. Examples chosen for this volume include the poet Nilkantha Mukhopadhyay (1841-1912), the journalist and anthologist Isvarcandra Gupta (1818-1859), and the playwright Giriscandra Ghos (1844-1912). Ghos, in particular, was an admirer of the Sakta saint, Ramkrsna (1836-1886), the most famous Kali devotee of his time. 5. One of the most intriguing, if short-lived, uses of the Kali and Uma material was during the early decades of the twentieth century, when nationalists called for Bengalis to conceive of their motherland as a goddess. Although this goddess •was rarely named Kali, Durga, or Uma—typically she was simply Ma (Mother) or Bharata Mata (Mother India)—she certainly took over their functions: like Kali, the Mother of the World, her help was sought in reducing prejudice between her children; like the ten-armed Durga, she was called upon to use her martial powers\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nto rid India of foreigners; and like Uma, she was importuned not to leave onVijaya until she had cleansed Bengal of (white) demons; see poems 89,155,156,163, and 164, by Mahendranath Bhattacarya (1843-1908) and Najrul Islam (1899-1976), the only Muslim to contribute to this literary genre. Although, as a whole, there are remarkably few references in the entire Sakta poetry to contemporary events, these politicized poems demonstrate that Bengali goddesses have been, and could again be, inspirational in galvanizing patriotic fervor. Mahendranath and Najrul are also the first two poets after Ramprasad and Kamalakanta to write a significant number of poems on Sakta themes; because of this, and the excellent quality of their compositions, they may be considered as the first truly important literary heirs of the early poets. Further, Mahendranath, like Ramprasad and Kamalakanta before him, was famed as a holy man, someone whose poetry flowed from hours of meditation on Kali. 6. Finally, we turn to poets who have been writing since the 1970s, some of whom have published their songs in books (Asutos Bhattacarya, Dinram, Bhadresvar Mandal, Kalyankumar Mukhopadhyay, Ramrenu Mukhopadhyay, and Ganapati Pathak), and others who have come to public recognition principally through cassette and compact disc recordings (Ma Basanti Cakrabartti, Syamapad Basu Ray, and Tapas Ray). Three of the four authors about whom I have been able to gather information—Dinram, Bhadresvar Mandal, and Ganapati Pathak9— worked all their lives in government service, education, and banking, respectively; lacking a patron such as might have been available in the eighteenth century, their poetry writing has been perforce a hobby, though it reflects real love for the Goddess. Of the nine composers, Dinram and Ma Basanti Cakrabartti are in many ways the most interesting from a literary standpoint. Dmram, a pseudonym, is one of few modern poets to write on Tantric kundalim yoga, and Ma Basanti Cakrabartti, the celibate head of her own ashram in Calcutta and one of the only women in the entire Sakta PadavalT corpus, expresses in her lyrics the concerns of a Bengali housewife, who prefers the domestic situation of Parvati and Siva to the unbecoming dominance of Siva by Kali (poems 30 and 53). In sum, although the early poets Ramprasad and Kamalakanta are deservedly the most popular among Sakta Padavali enthusiasts, not only as poets but also as men of great devotion, the tradition initiated by them has grown and expanded over the past two centuries and has produced several poets of great creativity. Just as it is clear with respect to image, language, and emotional timbre that Kamalakanta copied Ramprasad, however, so also subsequent poets copied both Ramprasad and Kamalakanta. As a result, much of what has been and continues to be published is derivative, with metaphors and phrases from the early poets reappearing years later in less accomplished form. This is certainly not a problem within a devotional framework; after all, does the Goddess care about poetic brilliance? But from a literary critical standpoint, one must say that with a few exceptions, notably Najrul Islam, Mahendranath Bhattacarya, and perhaps Dinram—men who wrote voluminously, with sensitivity and novelty—the genre has remained firmly anchored in the path charted by its progenitors.\n\n10\n\nSINGING TO THE GODDESS\n\nFamily Resemblances: Sakta Padavali as Bhakti Poetry There is much in the Syama-sarigita and Uma-sangita that reminds one of bhakti poetry in other centuries and sites in India. Attitudes toward the divine are emotive, highly personal, pervaded with an undercurrent of love and adoration, and expressed in an earthy vernacular that abounds with regional words and metaphors; grace and self-surrender are emphasized; the teacher's guidance is frequently alluded to; the philosophical language of absolutes, superlatives, and coincidences of opposites is called upon to substantiate claims about the Goddess's preeminence; and, like much devotional poetry elsewhere, the Sakta songs give few hints about the actual historical circumstances of their authors' lives.10 But there are also a number of peculiarities in this poetry tradition, characteristics that appear to separate the Bengali genre from, say, the Tamil or the Hindi. First, as a community of mainly upper-caste poets, they almost never denigrate caste boundaries; intriguingly the only one to do so is Najrul Islam, a Muslim (poems 155 and 156). Second, although many of the professional entertainers may have traveled widely, and although bards may have carried the most popular compositions of their contemporaries from place to place in Bengal, there is no tradition of wandering per se; the legends of the famed poets are replete with examples of their planning, and then canceling, trips to celebrated pilgrimage places, claiming in song that all necessary holy spots are at the Goddess's feet (poems 93—95). Third, although this Bengal-centered emphasis might lead one to suspect that the poems would be full of references to specific Bengali sites, temples, or images of the Goddess, such is not the case. Save for the modern period, when poets like Syamapad Basu Ray praise Kali and the Daksinesvar Temple, home to her saints Ramkrsna and Sarada Debi (poem 88), there is absolutely nothing parallel to \"my lord of the meeting rivers\" or \"my lord white as jasmine\" of the Tamil Saivite bhakti poetry tradition.11 Fourth, because the chief deities to whom most devotional poetry has been written—Siva,Visnu, and Krsna—are male, and because there is an established custom of male poets identifying with a female figure in order to experience the height of union with the deity, God in these other traditions can be conceived as the poet's Beloved. Such is rarely the case for the Bengali poets, since it is taboo to imagine having a lover-beloved relationship •with one's Mother. As mentioned above, vatsalya and prati-vatsalya are the type of intimacy typically enjoyed in the Sakta poetry.The one exception is, of course,Tantra, where the adept is encouraged either to watch the lovemaking of Siva and Sakti in the sahasram at the top of his head (poems 7—9 and 106), or to identify with the kundalim in her journey to and then union with Siva (poems 104—105). The only place where the poet is told to imagine himself, as Siva, having sex with the Goddess is in the context of the five-\"m\" ritual, the mechanics of which the poets never discuss.12 There are two further important distinctions between the Bengali devotional poetry and that of other vernaculars. Here there are no lines of succession between one poet and another, no clear evidence that poets knew each other or\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nstudied with each other, and no one from within the poetry tradition itself who wrote a spiritual history of the movement. We know from the similarities between poems that the poets must have heard each other's compositions, but how remains a mystery. Even to this day, there are very few singing groups devoted to the perpetuation of the genre. One locally famous exception is the Andul Kall-KIrtan Samiti, a band of men, all Kali-worshiping householders, who carry on the tradition of singing Mahendranath Bhattacarya's compositions in temples and religious functions. In addition, there are several famed artists who commercially record the songs of Ramprasad, Kamalakanta, and others, but their milieu is the concert hall, and they treat Sakta Padavali more as a cultural heritage than as the means to spiritual advancement. Finally, although bhakti is certainly the underlying flavor of most of the poems in this anthology, it is by no means predominant in all. As the samples in the section on \"Prioritizing Paths\" (p. 93-102) attest, sometimes Tantric meditation is juxtaposed with devotion, and is said to be superior. Indeed, although most poems of the mid-nineteenth century and after are squarely dualistic, in which the aspirant aims to love, not merge with, the Goddess, the same is not true for the earliest poems by Ramprasad and Kamalakanta who, more thoroughly Tantric in orientation, desire to become one with the divine.\n\nThe Challenges and Choices in Designing an Anthology The most popular anthology of Sakta songs in Bengali is Sakta Padabali, edited by Amarendranath Ray and published by the Calcutta University in 1942.This book has remained continuously in print since that date (though never updated), and is used as a text in courses on Bengali literature at the Calcutta University. If a university library in the United States has any Bengali collection of Sakta songs, it is likely to be Ray's, and I have seen well-thumbed copies of the book beside the harmoniums of professional Bengali singers in Calcutta, to be mined for recordable songs.13 Sakta Padabali contains 335 songs by 114 composers and is divided thematically into sixteen sections, without individual introductions. Although Singing to the Goddess is far from being a translation of Ray's work,14 in the planning and design of my anthology I have been greatly influenced by his, especially because of its importance in Bengali higher education over the last sixty years. However, in four ways the present volume differs from the model established by the Bengali precedent. The great benefit of Ray's collection is its breadth and scope, particularly for the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries; he has included poems by all known zamindars, dewam, street entertainers, litterateurs, and dramatists, even if they wrote only one or two Goddess-centered lyrics their whole lives. He also deliberately juxtaposed poems of similar content or language to show continuities and borrowing. In a smaller anthology, one has neither of these luxuries. My guiding principle has been to cover all the traditional topics -with as wide a range of poets as possible, but, in the event of having to choose between two poems on the same theme,\n\n12\n\nSINGING TO THE GODDESS\n\nto translate the poem that is better written and has more interesting, perhaps novel, imagery. Hence, whereas a truly representative anthology would include the one extant poem by Maharaja Krsnacandra Ray, Ramprasad's patron and one of the most important sponsors of Sakta ritual in mid-eighteenth-century Bengal, it does not appear here because it mirrors sentiments expressed better by Ramprasad. Indeed, there is much in this literary tradition that is repetitive; this may be fine for the devotee, who reads the poems for spiritual uplift, but not for the general reader. In thus favoring novelty and literary quality as criteria for selection, I am departing from the tradition, which values instead the virtue of continuity and the pure evocation of religious sentiment. However, all seventeen composers whom Ray quotes most often find a place in this anthology as -well, even if I have chosen poems different from the ones he did to represent their talent.15 The only exception I make to my own rule concerns female poets, whose voices, even up to the present, are so few that I have tried wherever possible to incorporate them, even if the poetry is not of the highest standard.16 A second choice has concerned how to give adequate voice to Bengali audience sentiment. Many of the Sakta songs have been popularized through records, cassettes, or compact discs; some, in fact, have been continuously recorded and rerecorded from the 1930s to the present. Singing to the Goddess is not a Biggest Hits of . . . volume, but one does want to be sensitive to Bengali opinion. As far as possible, I have tried, in considering poems for inclusion, to choose those that are also beloved by the public, so that if a Bengali were to pick up this volume and look through the index of first lines for her favorite lyrics, she would find them translated. However, if a poem in question appears to be popular principally because of its tune, or if its lyrics are not particularly noteworthy, I have passed it over in favor of another that is better expressed or, for instance, carries the Uma-Menaka story line in a new direction, even if it has never been lifted out of an anthology for studio recording. Where appropriate, the notes at the end of this volume indicate which poems have been recorded and where, and there is a discography for those interested in listening to a much wider range of Sakta Padavali. Third, the present anthology updates Ray's collection, both by adding composers writing in the genre since the 1940s and by reaching back into the past to include poets who did not make it into his list of authors. The most important in the latter category is the Muslim poet Najrul Islam, who is one of the most innovative composers in the genre since Ramprasad Sen. Two others are Sarada Bhandari and Tarini Debl, women about whom almost nothing is known but who, together with Andha Candi and Ma Basanti Cakrabartti, the modern lyricist, are four of the few women writers in the entire Sakta Padavali corpus. Fourth, a word about content. A comparison between Sakta Padabali and Singing to the Goddess will reveal that some of the traditional topics are treated differently in the two volumes. Relatively speaking, poems on the themes of battle, advice to the mind, and death receive equal weight in both anthologies. However, Ray chose to emphasize petitionary poems to Kali and the agamam and vijaya poems to Uma far more than I have, whereas I have included more poems\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nof complaint and an entire section on Tantric kundalini yoga, which he completely omitted. This last point is significant: in almost all Bengali anthologies that do not present the whole of a poet's work—say, selections of Ramprasad or Kamalakanta—the poems left out are those with Tantric import and those that depict Siva and Kali in union in the sahasrara. Such poems are considered too esoteric or too scandalous for a general audience. They are nevertheless a genuine part of the genre and deserve a place in its English representation. To conclude, a note about the history of Sakta Padavali in English translation. It was Mahendranath Gupta, the disciple and biographer of Ramkrsna, who first introduced the Sakta songs to an English audience with his translation of the Kathamrta in 1907.17 Ramprasad, Kamalakanta, and a host of other poets, Sakta as well as Vaisnava, were favorites of Ramkrsna, and he and his disciples would sing them together, sending the saint into spiritual ecstasy. Since they were threaded into a narrative about Ramkrsna s sayings and activities, however, the songs were not always quoted in their entirety and often lacked any indication as to author. The first real anthology was compiled by Edward Thompson and Arthur Spencer, whose Bengali Religious Lyrics, &akta, complete with introduction and biographical notes on the poets, was published in 1923.18 This remained the only collection of Goddess-centered Bengali devotional poetry available outside the Bengalispeaking world until Jadunath Sinha and Michele Lupsa published their English and French versions of Ramprasad's poetry in 1966 and 1967.19 In 1994, Lex Hixon updated the language of Sinha's translations in his Mother of the Universe:Visions of the Goddess and Tantric Hymns of Enlightenment,'2'0 but as he did not work from the Bengali and only reconfigured Sinha's English, this is not a reliable set of translations. The best collection of Ramprasad's poetry to appear in English is Grace and Mercy in Her Wild Hair: Poems to the Mother Goddess, translated by Leonard Nathan and Clinton Seely in 1982.21 These poems are so beautifully rendered that they set a standard for translation in the genre.22 Notes on Transliteration, Translation, and Word Definition To enable better comprehension for readers unfamiliar with Bengali, I have used standard Sanskrit transliteration conventions to render all terms, names of deities, and types of textual genres. However, names and nicknames of Bengali poets, authors, and singing groups, as well as the texts or anthologies they authored, are written with Bengali conventions. The same is true for first lines of poetry cited in notes, and for any terms that do not have exact Sanskrit equivalents (such as the Cadak or Gajan festival, the police chief kotal, and the name Thakur to refer to a chosen deity). Although the Mughal term for financial steward is written as deoyan in Bengali, I have followed the lead of many historians in transliterating it as dewan or, when part of a person's title, Dewan. The names of geographic sites, towns, rivers, and temples are all rendered -without diacritics and, -where available, in recognized Anglicized forms.Words that have entered the English language are not italicized and are printed without diacrities.\n\n14\n\nSINGING TO THE GODDESS\n\nIn keeping with the ambiance of the Uma-centered poems, the majority of which are spoken by Uma's mother, who does not see her daughter as the Goddess, I have not capitalized personal pronouns that refer to Uma. Since Ma is so pervasive in this poetry genre, to refer either to Kali as \"Mother\" or to Uma as \"little mother\" in an affectionate form of address to a small girl, I have often left it as is in the English translations. Whenever a Bengali epithet or term appears for the first time in the text, it is defined there, or in the note to the appropriate poem, and then not in subsequent usages. For the convenience of the reader, the most common such words are defined in the glossary, \"A Guide to Selected Names,Terms, and Text,\" on page 173.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nThe Poems\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nKali among the Corpses: Poems of Battle\n\nWe begin with Kali in her fiercest and perhaps oldest guise. These battlefield poems—together with those on the kundalim, translated near the end of the anthology—reflect more than any other type of poem the Tantric origins of the Sakta literary tradition, and hence reach back into medieval conceptions of the Goddess's character. All of the poems to follow are modeled on the Tantric dhyanas, or descriptions of a deity used as an aid to the mental construction and installation of her in the heart, for the purpose of meditation. Below is a literal translation of the most famous of these for Kali, as an example of the Sanskrit prototype from which the Bengali battlefield poetry is taken. Terrible-faced, horrible, with disheveled hair and four arms, Divine, adorned with a necklace of sliced-off heads; Holding in Her two left hands a freshly hacked head and a cleaver, And in Her right displaying the \"fear not\" and boon-bestowing hand gestures; Lustrously black like a large cloud, and robed with nothing but the sky, Anointed with blood dripping down from the necklace of heads at Her throat; Terrible because of the pair of children's corpses She wears for earrings, Her teeth horrid and Her face frightful, but Her breasts high and uplifted; A skirt of cut arms hanging from Her waist, laughter bellowing out, Her face shining from the red stream dripping from the two corners of Her mouth; Shouting terribly, dwelling on the very fierce cremation grounds, Her third eye permeated with the newly risen sun; With fangs for teeth and a pearl necklace that swings to the right as She moves, Sitting on the Great Lord, who has taken the form of a corpse; Surrounded by jackals and their terrible, all-pervading cries, Engaging Great Time in the act of reversed sexual intercourse; Her face happy and pleased, like a lotus— He who thinks on Kali thus will have all his wishes fulfilled.23 Other KalT-dhyanas add that she is accompanied by her ghoulish friends and that she has a half-moon on her forehead; the sun, moon, and fire for her three eyes; 19\n\nmatted hair; a lolling tongue thirsting for wine or the blood of corpses; a snake draped around her as a sacred thread; and a body black as mascara, adorned with all manner of jewels and ornaments. She is so brilliant that even the gods worship her. In all of the available Tantric descriptions of this Goddess, the macabre is combined with the soothing, the fearsome with the pacific, so as to create a purposeful tension (see Fig. 2).The Bengali poets are true to this aspect of the Sanskrit literary tradition and draw upon the same imagery. A few, in fact, do no more than to render the dhyanas into Bengali. This is especially true of the early zamindars, who self-consciously undertook a program of popularizing Tantric texts, deities, and rites through translations into the vernacular. Poem 1, by Kamalakanta's patron's son, Maharajadhiraja Mahtabcand, is an example, notable for its clear reliance on the Sanskrit dhyana given above. However, most Bengali Sakta poets depart from the Tantric model in four principal ways. First, they add movement to the picture, transforming the Tantric icon—static, intended for meditation—into a dynamic scene. Often evocative of the Puranic \"Devi-Mahatmya\" story, the Bengali setting is less a cremation ground than a battlefield, in which Kali is worsting her demon enemies (in particular, Canda, Munda, and Raktavija). Much more attention is devoted to her mastication of her foes than in the Sanskrit dhyanas. In addition, she is stomping, dancing, and creating havoc, rather than simply standing or sitting on Siva. In other words, the Tantric descriptions have been colored by Puranic narrative elements. Second, the Bengali poets beautify and humanize Kali more than their Sanskrit literary predecessors. They do this by borrowing from classical descriptions of feminine beauty in order to depict the Goddess's youth, her navel, breasts, and thighs; by comparing aspects of her appearance with natural phenomena, such as flowers, birds, or rivers; by adding ornaments, such as tinkling bells, to parts of her blood-covered body (poem 3); and by depicting the love between Kali and Siva in explicit language, where reversed sexual intercourse is not simply stated, as in the dhyanas, but depicted (poems 7, 8, and 9), and where the language and imagery used to illustrate their love is reminiscent of that between Radha and Krsna. Note that in poems 18, 19, and 20 the scene is less and less recognizably either the cremation or the battle ground; Kali's traditional iconographic elements have almost disappeared, in favor of classical andVaisnava images. A Vaisnava song is even sung in the context of her worship in poem 20. Although most poets follow this sweetening trend, begun in the Tantras and given new impetus by Ramprasad, not all do. Poem 10, by Dasarathi Ray, shows how the Goddess appears when there is almost nothing to mitigate her fierce nature. The addition of bhanitas is a third departure from the Tantric template, permitting the poets to personalize the dhyanas so that their compositions are less instruction for meditation than opportunities to talk to the Goddess directly or to convey the poets' states of mind.They express a range of emotions in such signature lines: devotion, petition, horror, triumph, and engrossed amazement, as well as sarcastic censure. For the disjunction between Kali the dread demon slayer and Kali the\n\n20\n\nSINGING TO THE GODDESS\n\nbeautiful picture of modesty is a cause for bewilderment and an occasion for the poets to accost their Goddess, sometimes playfully, sometimes with more bite. Who is this? How can Kali be a girl from a respectable family—indeed, a gentlewoman— when she acts so dishonorably? The sense of real or mock shame at the Goddess's appearance and behavior is an indication that the Bengali poets are dealing inventively with a difficult, or at the very least, complex, inherited deity. Finally, after personalizing Kali and creating a literary space for themselves in relation to her, the Bengali poets also turn their attention to Siva or Hara. He remains the corpse beneath Kali's feet, to be sure. But he is also her sexual partner, the victim of her mad stomping, on whose behalf Kamalakanta pleads to the Goddess in poem 15, and her chief devotee. He too, in other words, has been drawn into the narrative of devotion. Over the past two centuries, fewer and fewer Sakta poets have chosen to write on this Tantric battlefield theme. This has been for two reasons: knowledge about and involvement with Tantra has lessened among authors writing in the genre; and the Goddess herself has become increasingly identified with a loving mother, whom one would not like to describe in gory or sexual terms. The seeds for such a development are contained already in Ramprasad's corpus. Compare, for instance, poems 6 and 17. In the former, collected in 1862, Siva is a corpse, and Kali is clearly dominant over him. The latter, on the other hand, printed for the first time in the 1890s and almost certainly not original to the earliest Ramprasad, presents a picture of a demure wife who would never step on her husband. It is as if the shame at Kali's iconography and wild nature—expressed boldly or in jest by the early poets—has become real, and a cause for respectful silence.\n\n1 Who is this, all alone? Whose woman is She, shining like the moon, inky black? She's dread of face, with blood streaming from Her mouth and from Her tongue clamped between Her teeth—yet She's young and the flying streams of hair on that terrible body shine. A pearl necklace swings at Her throat, a girdle of human hands encircles Her waist. Her breasts, plump and jutting out, and the rest of Her monstrous body are covered with rivers of blood. I see Her children's corpses at Her ears, a half-moon on Her forehead, naked. This woman plays on the battlefield, Her left hands holding a sword and a head,\n\n21\n\nand Her right signaling \"fear not!\" and boons. Her clothes are horrifying, and so is She, standing on Bhava's chest with Her right foot forward. In every direction on the cremation grounds the jackals howl and Sahkari cackles horridly. Candra says: Promise me that at my end I can meditate on You like this Oh three-eyed Kali. Mahdrdjddhirdja Mdhtdbcdnd\n\n2\n\nWhat a joke! She's a young woman from a good family yes, but She's naked—and flirts, hips cocked when She stands. With messy hair roars awful and grim this gentlewoman tramples demons in a corpse-strewn battle. But the God of Love looks and swoons. While ghosts, ghouls, and goblins from Siva's retinue, and Her own companions nude just like Her dance and frolic on the field, She swallows elephants chariots, and charioteers striking terror into the hearts of gods, demons, and men. She walks fast, enjoying Herself tremendously. Human arms hang from Her waist. Ramprasad says: Mother Kalika, preserver of the world, have mercy! Take the burden:\n\n22\n\nferry me across this ocean of becoming. Haras woman, destroy my sorrows. Ramprasad Sen\n\n3 Hey! Who is She, dark as clouds, nubile, naked, shameless, captivating hearts? Most improper for a family girl! Stomping like an elephant, dizzy with drink, tongue distended, hair flying, crushing demons horrid shrieks— what a sight! Men and gods recoil in fear. Who is She? Her fingers blossoming blue lotus buds bitten by bees, Her face the full moon— So think the cakora birds offering themselves at Her lips. A dispute begins: is She the bees' blue lotus or the cakoras' moon? \"Chi-chi\" chirp the birds, \"Gun-gun\" drone the bees. Who is She? Her loins are exquisite, and Her thighs streaming with blood bring to mind sturdy banana plant stalks. Above them around Her waist She has threaded human hands on a string, adding tinkling bells for decoration. With the fairest of hands She grasps a sword and severed head on the left, and promises boons and protection on the right.\n\n23\n\nWhile She hacks to pieces horses, chariots, elephants Her companions cheer Her on— \"Victory! Victory!\" Who is She? Demons see Her breasts very lofty mountains and strike their elephants' heads in fear to get away. What could be more amazing? The Beautiful One beautifies Herself with heads Canda's and Munda's! strung on a necklace! The sweetest smile breaks out on Her cheerful face; in a dazzling flash of teeth, lightning shoots to sparkle in Her nose jewel. With a wink of Her eyes sun, fire, and moon She stomps up and down and the earth quakes and quakes. Rdmpmsad Sen\n\n4\n\nWho is this delighting in war dancing naked with witches on the battlefield? The rays of the morning sun and ten moons glisten in Her toenails. Amazing! Her body black as clouds\n\n24\n\npierces darkness with its sheen, and Hara, a cadaver, is fallen at Her feet. There too lie brilliant reds and whites, intoxicating Java and bilva flowers, heaped by the immortals. She's got hair blacker than clouds, eyes shot with the lotus's red, a distended, dangling tongue, and a face a horrible face •with streams of blood oozing from Her lips. The earth trembles at Her arrogance. Suddenly a dreadful shriek, a blast of fire—lightning explodes from Her eyes to dance playfully in the sparkle of Her teeth. This is a frightful sight; it can make you fear. But for a devotee She's a blessing who takes away fear. Her Lowly One says: This is no ordinary being but the risen form of the Goddess Whose Essence Is Brahman. Raghunath Ray\n\n5 Who is this enchantress lighting up the war field by Her black beauty? Whose woman with huge eyes and a dreadful face adorns Herself for battle with a garland of heads? Jackals are dancing among the corpses and noncorpses, making horrid noises. Joining them\n\n25\n\nShe cackles aloud a hideous laughter and places Her feet on the heart of corpse-like Siva, tousling Her long thick hair. Kamalakanta stares absorbed not even blinking his eyes. Kamalakanta Bhattacdrya\n\n6 Her face is a spotless moon ever blissful drinking nectar, Her body graceful, startling the bodiless God of Love. Oh King, don't be shocked but Siva whom you take as Brahman is a corpse at Her feet! Who is this woman on the battlefield? She wears a sliver of the moon, embodies all virtues and smiles sweetly Honey Lips! This is hard for a man to bear. Think of it: She illumines the earth, Her three eyes moon, sun, and fire flashing light. This sweetheart is the best of all and of course virtuous but\n\n26\n\nwhose daughter is She and what has She come searching for on the battlefield? Look at Her deformed companions: their nails bowed bamboo winnowing baskets their radish teeth, rumpled hair, and dusty bodies scare me. Poet Ramprasad says, ShieldYour slave who cries out \"Ma!\" in utter horror. If You don't forgive his sins Syama, Uma who will callYou \"Mother\"? Ramprasad Sen\n\n7 Unperturbed at the battle, frightful ghouls dance saying \"Victory to Kali! Kali!\" Sankari, immersed in the waves of battle, feels the spring breezes pleasant. That very Brahma, Lord of the Earth, whose wives smear red powder on His blessed body, when in the form of Syama plays with blood-red colors in the company of Her female attendants. Sweating with the fun of reversed sexual intercourse, young Syama's flesh thrills on top of young Siva, Her boat amidst the deep ocean of nectar. Her long hair reaches down to the ground. She is naked, ornamented with human heads and hands.\n\n27\n\nKamalakanta watches their beautiful bodies and sheds tears of bliss. Kamalakanta Bhattacarya\n\n8 So, forgetful Mahadeva, You have fallen in love! You got Her footprints and now there's no separating You; staring, staring, You worship Her. Her heavy locks of hair, darker than a mass of clouds, fall disheveled over Her body. Incomparably glamorous! Who knows the greatness of either of You— You sky-clad sixteen-year-old, and You, naked Tripurari? There is no end to the bliss of Madana's Bewitcher. Lying lazily under the woman's hold, He thirsts for the taste of love play. Saying endearing things He makes love to the beautiful one in the lotus heart of Kamalakanta. Kamalakanta Bhattacarya\n\n9 There's a huge hullabaloo in my lotus heart; my crazy mind is getting me in trouble again! It's a carnival for crazies— two madcaps copulating! Again and again the Bliss-Filled Goddess collapses 28\n\nin ecstacy on the Lord Ever-Blissful. I stare at this, speechless; even the senses and six enemies are silent. Taking advantage of this confusion, the door of knowledge opens. Crazy Premik says, Everyone tells me I'm muddle-headed, but can the son of confirmed crackpots be normal? Listen MaTara, Remover of the World's Sins, I'm going to cherish this moment; and when at the end I'm submerged in the water take Your son onto Your lap. Mahendranath Bhattacarya\n\n10\n\nWho is this black drunk female elephant? She dances naked on the battlefield, tongue distended teeth bared. Her black form lights the three worlds. With a head in one hand, more heads beaded on a necklace and corpses at Her ears, She delights in two recent additions Canda's and Munda's heads then drinks the blood of Raktavija. The woman's hair falls to the earth, Her crown reaches the sky.Yawning open a gaping mouth She devours demons in droves. Wearing a half-moon, bearing a sword, She jumps stomps bumps thumps on the earth, who trembles\n\n29\n\nunder Her weight. That's why the Ganges-Holder took Her feet and stood them on His chest. Demons see Her awful appearance Her four hands and flee away. \"How can we calm Her down? How to escape?\" Four-handedly She destroys horses and elephants, their blood gushing out in rivers. Jackals as well as Her other friends demons, witches, and fiends swim in those waves. Blood everywhere all Her limbs and body parts: How to describe its sheen? a red Java flower floating on billowy black waters in the Kalindi River. Rumbling like a deep cloud of destruction aiming like a pouncing lion for the stag, Her blood-shot eyes tell all. Dasarathi's Enemy kills and laughs. Dasamthi Ray\n\n11 The World-Mother's police chief goes strolling in the dead of night. \"Victory to Kali! Victory to Kali!\" he shouts clapping his hands and\"bab bam!\" striking his cheeks. Ghosts, goblins, and corpses roused by spirits also roam about. In an empty house\n\n30\n\nat the crossroads they hope to unnerve the devotee. A half-moon on his forehead a big trident in his hand clumps of matted hairs falling to his feet the police chief is arrogant like Death. First he resembles a snake then a tiger then a huge bear! This may alarm the devotee: Ghosts will kill me! I can't sit a second more! He's turning toward me blood-red eyes! But can a true practitioner fall into danger? The police chief is pleased: \"Well done! Well done! Kali of the Grisly Face has empowered your mantra. You've conquered now and forever!\" Poet Ramprasad the slave floats in a sea of bliss. What can trouble a practitioner? Are frightful scenes a threat? He stays sitting on the hero's seat, with Kali's feet for a shield. Ramprasad Sen\n\n12\n\nThe moon flashes in Her blessed face. God oh God—how lovely! I saw Her and blanked out; shame on me! I failed to offer Java flowers at Her feet. 31\n\nHe who installs the Mother on earth is a king of men, a great ruler. Twice-born Ramkrsna is a good protector of the land; I have crossed over this world and the next. Maharaja Ramkrsna Ray\n\n13\n\nWho is this, dressed like a crazy woman, robed with the sky? Whom does She belong to? She has let down Her hair, thrown off Her clothes, strung human hands around Her waist, and taken a sword in Her hand. Her face sparkles from the reflection of Her teeth, and Her tongue lolls out. The smile on that moon-face drips heaps and heaps of nectar. Mother, are You going to rescue Kamalakanta in this outfit? Kamalakanta Bhattacarya\n\n14\n\nOh hey, All-Destroyer, which corpses did You raid for ash to come here smeared like this? Don't You have a place to play that's not a crematorium? Oh Wild-Haired One, You tousle Your hair and wander at will. If I follow You even a moment I get no peace.\n\n32\n\nOh bone-burning bothersome girl! Where didYou get Your necklace of bones? And why, when the cream of Your skin bewitches the world, do You arrive here plastered with soot? With tears from my eyes I'll wash off Your smut; come, Ma, to my lap. Yet even when I holdYou to my chest, still I die of pain; that's why I abuse You, Ma. Najrul Islam\n\n15\n\nKali is every thing You do misleading? Look.Your beloved has thrown Himself under Your feet! Mother I beg You with folded hands: don't dance on top of Siva! I know how Tripura's Enemy feels. Beautiful Tripura, Kind Wo man, just this once, stop. You're the murderer of Your own husband; You're killing Your lord! The King of Living Beings is almost dead! Once hearing people criticize Siva You got angry and left Your body for love. Mother! The man You're standing on is the same Three-Eyed One! Calm down\n\nlook at Him; it's the Naked Lord! 33\n\nThis is what Kamalakanta wants to understand: You know everything, so why all these deceptions? This time, I think, You've gone too far, You Whose Seat Is a Corpse. Kamalakanta Bhattdcarya\n\n16\n\nKali, what family are You from? You're absorbed in Your own fun and games. Who really understands Your incomparable beauty? If I look at You I can't tell day from night. Though You're black glossier than smeared mascara You don't wear saris, gold, or jewels Your hair's all tousled andYou're always at the cremation grounds even so my mind forgets all this I don't know how. Look! The Jewel of men masses of matted hair and snakes on His head is He devoted to Your feet? Who are You to Him? Who is He to You? Who would ever guess that the Crest-Jewel of the gods the Shelter of the shelterless the Entertainer of the universe would cling to Your feet as the most cherished treasure? Kamalakanta can't comprehendYour endless virtues. The earth and sky are lit by Your beauty. Kamalakanta Bhattdcarya\n\n34\n\n17 It's not Siva at Mother's feet. Only liars say that. Markandeya wrote it clearly in the Candt: while killing demons, saving the gods from their fix, Ma stepped on a demon child fallen to the ground. At the touch of Her feet the demon boy changed; suddenly he was Siva on the battlefield. As a good wife would She ever put Her feet on Her husband's chest? No, She wouldn't. But a servant is different: Ramprasad pleads— place those fear-dispelling feet on my lotus heart. Ramprasad Sen\n\n18\n\nHow can that black woman be so beautiful? Fate has made Her the color of a new cloud. She laughs horribly lightning darting from Her teeth, yet what a lot of nectar drips from Her moon-face! The sun shines in Her sindura dot, that lotus face\n\n35\n\nbeguiling even the God of Love. Sun, fire, and moon sattva, rajas, and tamos have risen reddish in Her three eyes. Her navel is a lotus swaying inside a lake, where water lilies bloom into breasts. Her thick hair streams down Her body, a garland of heads hanging around Her neck. Even those earrings children's corpses look stunning against the Mother's ears. Ornament after ornament adorns Her beautiful feet, Her toenails shaming the moon by their mirrorlike gleam. Seeing such a sweet form Kamalakanta goes to Syama's very spotless feet for refuge. Kamalakanta Bhattdcarya\n\n19\n\nKali! Today in the dark grove creepers with their crimson shoots are a fiery mass. Anklets tinkle, bees hum, cuckoos sweetly sing. On Her head is a peacock's crown, at Her ears, vihahgi bird ornaments. Her navel is a white lotus and She has restless khanjana bird eyes. Bees sip nectar from Her flowery face. With tamala trees for legs, ankleted with snakes,\n\n36\n\nShe stands on Siva the silver mountain. Kamalakanta, look at this great wonder: Sankari on the chest of Sarikara. Kamalakanta Bhattacarya\n\n20 Use your mental eye and see Syama's matchless form: She's brilliant like lightning cleaving black clouds, and the sun and moon, clouds and stars, hover at Her feet. In the three worlds She's beautiful beyond compare, and so sweet, with moons by the thousands in Her toenails, and serpents twined for braids, ducking down always hiding one taking space from another. Stay like this, my Three-eyed Mother, and dance! Dance in bliss, Ever-Blissful Best of Women on Nilkantha's lotus heart. Beat the sweet tnrdanga drums, make music on the vina. And sing the name of Hari in modes and measures. NTlkantha Mukhopadhyay\n\n37\n\nThe Cosmic Goddess of Transformation\n\nIn this section, the Goddess's principal epithet is Brahmamayi, She Who Is Filled with Brahman, or Whose Essence Is Brahman. As such, she has the ability both to encapsulate and embody all forms as well as to transcend them. Her forms, when she chooses to take them, encompass the range of opposites: male and female, black and white and all colors in between, material and spiritual, beautiful and terrible. In addition, they include any of the chief deities of the Hindu (and even Muslim and Christian) traditions, although—possibly for purposes of countering the rival Vaisnava cult—her poets have a particular preference for her identification with Krsna. As poem 30 indicates, she also incarnates herself in human women. That Brahmamayi can transform herself into such an array of beings is cause for the poets' wonder; they claim that she does so out of compassion for her worshipers, each of whom thinks of her in a different way, and out of the sheer joy at doing what she pleases. In any case, her abilities are beyond the ken of any living person, and many of the poems end with examples of the impossible, as a way of conveying how difficult it is to grasp the infinitude of the Goddess's transformative powers. Even the traditional sources of knowledge—the six philosophies, and the Vedas, Nigamas, Agamas, and Puranas—cannot penetrate her being.24 Only Siva can claim such understanding.\n\n21\n\nWho can understand Kali? You can't get Her vision through the six philosophies. She plays with Siva two swans amorous amidst lush lotuses. Ascetics ponder Her from mfiladhara to sahasrara.\n\n38\n\nLike \"Om,\" the root of all, Kali is the self of one who delights in the self. Just for fun She dwells in body after body, encasing our universe in Her belly. Can you imagine measuring that? The Destructive Lord has grasped Her core, but who else can? Prasad says, People laugh at me trying to swim across the sea. My heart knows but my mind does not—and so though a dwarf I try to catch the moon! Ramprasad Sen\n\n22\n\nIs my black Mother Syama really black? People say Kali is black, but my heart doesn't agree. If She's black, how can She light up the world? Sometimes my Mother is white, sometimes yellow, blue, and red. I cannot fathom Her. My whole life has passed trying. She is Matter, then Spirit, then complete Void. It's easy to see how Kamalakanta thinking these things went crazy. Kamalakanta Bhattacarya\n\n39\n\n23\n\nMa,You're inside me; who says You keepYour distance, Syama? You're a stony girl, terrible illusion, dressing in many guises. For different methods of prayer You put on the five chief forms. But once someone realizes the five are one, there'll be no escape for You! Understanding the truth, he won't encumber You with false worship and You'll have to stop as if You'd sneezed to take his burdens. Once he knows the value of gold will he welcome glass by mistake? Prasad says, My heart is shaped like a flawless lotus. I place You there, my mental Goddess: Now dance! Rdmpmsdd Sen\n\n2\n\n4\n\nMother, You're always finding ways to amuse Yourself. Syama,You stream of nectar, through Your deluding power You forge a horrible face and adorn Yourself with a necklace of skulls. The earth quakes under Your leaps and bounds. You are frightful with that sword in Your hand.\n\n40\n\nAt other times You take a flirtatious pose, and then, Mother, even the God of Love is undone! Your form is inconceivable and undecaying. Narayam, Tripura, Tara— You are beyond the three qualities yet composed of them. You are terrifying, You are black, You are beautiful. Thus assuming various forms, You fulfill the wishes of Your worshipers. Sometimes You even dance Brahman, Eternal One in the lotus heart of Kamalakanta. Kamalakanta Bhattdcdrya\n\n25\n\nKali, Ma, You're dressed as Rasavihari, Vrindavan dancer! Your mantras are various and so are Your activities; who can grasp them? The subject is extraordinarily difficult. Half Your body's matchless Radha, a woman, and the other half's a man— a yellow cloth tied at Your waist, Your wild hair knotted back, and a flute in Your hand. Once You infatuated Tripura's Enemy stealing sideways glances at Him, but this time it's women You tempt with Your beautiful black figure and hinting eyes.\n\n41\n\nYour laugh used to be dreadful; it threw into a panic the three worlds. Now You speak sweetly. Girls inVraj swoon. As Syama,You danced in a sea of blood; today Your favorite waters are the Yamuna. Prasad laughs, flooded with delight: after thinking hard, I finally get it— Siva, Krsna, and the black-bodied Syama they're all one but nobody else can see it. Rampmsad Sen\n\n26 Syama Mother's lap a-climbing speak I always Syam's name. Ma's become my mantraguru; myThakur, though, is Radha-Syam. I dive into my Syama-Yamuna, and play there in the water with my Syam. But when He hurts me and neglects me, it's Ma who'll fill the dreams I am. On my heart, my instrument, Syam and Syama are two strings; playing at once inside myself, that splendid \"Om\" forever sings. With illusion's threads Great Illusion binds that teenaged Syam and brings Him here; so in Kailasa I call Her Ma but see the place asVraj's sphere. Najrul Islam\n\n42\n\n2\n\n7\n\nOh Kali Full of Brahman! I've searched them all Vedas, Agamas, Puranas and foundYou: Mahakali Krsna Siva Rama— they're allYou my Wild-Haired One. As Siva,You hold a horn, Krsna a flute, Rama a bow, and Kali a sword. You're the Naked Goddess with naked Siva, and the passionate Lord robed in yellow. Sometimes You live on burning grounds, sometimes at Ayodhya, and also at Gokul. Your friends are witches and terrifying spirits. Just as, for the sake of the young archer You took the form of Janaki, greatest beauty, So You do for any boy, Ma: become a girl. Prasad says, Like the smile of a beast with bared teeth ascertaining the nature of Brahman is impossible. But the essence of my Goddess is Brahman, and She lives in all forms. The Ganges, Gaya, and Kashi even they are arrayed at Her feet. Rampmsad Sen\n\n43\n\n28\n\nI understand now.Tara, I understand: You're a master at magic. However a person conceives of You, You willingly assume that form: the Burmese callYou Pharatara, the Europeans call You Lord. To Moguls, Pathans, Saiyads, and KazisYou are Khoda. Sakti for the Saktas, Siva for the Saivas, Surya for the Sauryas, and Radhika-ji for theVairagls. To GanapatyasYou are Ganesa, to Yaksas, Lord of Wealth, to artisans,Visvakarma, and among boatmen, Saint Badar. Sri Ramdulal says, This isn't trickery; quite the opposite. It is I reflecting on the divisions of the one Brahman who makes the mischief! Ramdulal Nandi\n\n29\n\nMa,You are Brahman! in the world of Brahma, Sarvamangala inVaikuntha, Gayesvarl in Gaya, and AmaravatT in Indra's world. In Daksa's home You are Sati, at Siva's place His wife Parvatl. I hear they caUYouVimala in Puri. But Mother of the World, show mercy to sad and dejected me and tell me this: if at the bridge You are Ramesvari and Ksemahkarl, and as RajesvariYou hold a skull-topped staff in Your hand, where do You manifest as all-pervading Vis'ves'vari?\n\n44\n\nAtVrindavanYou are Katyayam, in the Himalayas You lived in Giriraj's house, Ma, fascinating Him. You even wore a monster's guise in Kamsa's birthing room! Whatever form You take, Ma Sarikarl, \\vhether Candi in Lanka or Bhuvanesvari in the netherworld I can't understandYour play. Ma Candika, how didYou defeat Sumbha and Nisumbha or kill the buffalo demon with Your ten arms? For Srimanta's sake You took a freakish form Kamalekamini while sitting in a lotus clump in the deep waters of the sea. Sarada says, From that very lotus perch, Ma, You were engaged in swallowing elephants!? Sarada Bhandan\n\n30\n\nWherever there's a woman in any Bengali home doing her work screening her smiles with her veil, she is You, Ma; she is You, Black Goddess. Carefully rising with the light of dawn to attend with softened hands to household chores, she is You, Ma; she is You, Black Goddess. The woman who gives alms, makes vows, does worship, reads scriptures all correctly and with a smile who drapes her sari over the child on her lap soothing its hunger with a lullaby, she is You, Ma; she is You, Black Goddess.\n\n45\n\nShe can't be anyone else; mother, father, sister, housewife all are You. Even at death smiling You make the journey with us. My mind knows this, and my heart as well: she is You, Ma; she is You, Black Goddess. Ma BdsantT CakrabarttT\n\n46\n\nFigure 1.

The embodiment of illusion, who ensnares us in worldly attachments (maya), she is adept at magic, sorcery, and secrecy, and her relation to the world is one of self-absorbed play (lila). As such, she determines our actions. For some poets, this appears not to be a theological problem; Naracandra, in poem 31, admits her control with approbation. Most others, however, reprove their Goddess. If she has foreordained what we think, do, and say, then she cannot rightly blame us for our ineptitudes. Several of the poems that follow end on notes of sarcasm or critique. And yet there is another side to this Goddess of illusion. If she enmeshes us, she can also free us; hence the refusal to abandon her or to cease hoping in her saving grace. Because she is so unpredictable, she may yet choose to be kind. As Kamalakanta says in poem 33, if it were not for Kali's gentler side, he would never persevere in her worship. Note the obvious dependence of later poets, in this case Kamalakanta, upon the linguistic and theological precedents set by Ramprasad (poems 32 and 33).\n\n31\n\nEverything is Your wish,Tara, You Whose Wish Is Law. You do Your own work, but people say, \"I am acting.\" You make the elephant get stuck in mud, the lame man leap across mountains. To some You give the heights of Indra; others You push down to hell. I speak the words You make me speak.\n\n47\n\nYou are mystic diagrams You are mystic words; You are the essence of the Tantrasara. Namcandm Ray\n\n32\n\nWhat's the fault of the poor mind? Syama,You're the magician's daughter; it dances as You make it dance. You are action, virtue, and vice; I've figured out Your secret. Ma,You are earth,You are water; You make fruit ripen on the tree. You are power,You are devotion; You are even liberation, says Siva. You are suffering,You are happiness; so it's written in the Candt. Prasad says, The thread of attachment is spun by action's wheel. Crazy Kali and crazy Siva bind souls with it and make them play. Ramprasdd Sen\n\n33\n\nWhat's the fault of the poor mind? Why blame it unnecessarily? It dances as the magician's daughter makes it dance. You have heard She is merciful to the afflicted.\n\n48\n\nPeople say it's in theVedas. But how can One who forgets Herself ever notice the pains of others? She's the daughter of a cheat, so Siva's a great match for Her; He goes around naked, smeared with ashes, lest people say anything good about Him. Nevertheless Kamalakanta has surrendered his life to Her feet. Apart from them there is nothing. Otherwise, why ever would he regard Her feet as the essence of all? Kamalakanta Bhattacatya\n\n34 Ever-blissful Kali, Bewitcher of the Destructive Lord, Mother— for Your own amusement You dance, clapping Your hands. You with the moon on Your forehead, really You are primordial, eternal, void. When there was no world, Mother, where did You get that garland of skulls? You alone are the operator, we Your instruments, moving as You direct. Where You place us, we stand; the words You give us, we speak. Restless Kamalakanta says, rebukingly: You grabbed Your sword, All-Destroyer, and now You've cut down evil and good. Kamalakanta Bhattacdrya\n\n49\n\n35 Oh Ma Kali, for a long time now You've masqueraded in this world as a clown. But I am punished inside, and there's nothing funny about Your jokes. Oh Ma, sometimes You're the air we breathe, sometimes the sky in the seventh underworld furthest away, and sometimes the water in the sea. You assume so many forms! I have traveled to countless lands and worn countless costumes; even so, Your marvels—ha!—never cease. Premik says, My mind is a cad; that's why it's sunk in attachments. Why else would these tricks of Yours keep working? Mahendmndth Bhattacdrya\n\n36\n\nLook here— it's all the woman's play, secret, Her intentions Her own. In the controversies over saguna and niiguna, She breaks one lump of clay with another. In all matters this woman is equally willing to help except when you really need Her. Prasad says, Sit tight and float a raft on the Ocean of Becoming. When the high tide conies, move upstream, and when the waters ebb, go down. Rdmprasdd Sen\n\n50\n\n37 Brother, this world is nothing but a bamboo box, so I roll about in it my bazaar of bliss. Earth, water, fire, wind, and sky: these five make an ordered world. First gross matter then consciousness, together produce myriad forms like suns, multiplied on water in earthen bowls. But without the bowls there's just one sun. I sat like an ascetic in the womb, but now that I've fallen to the ground I swallow dirt. A midwife cut my umbilical cord; who am I to cut illusion's chains? Women charm speaking sweetly but there's poison, not nectar, in that cup. In the past I drank to my heart's content; now I writhe burning with venom. Ramprasad says with joy, Primordial Woman of the Primordial Man: do whatever You please, Mother, You—the daughter of a stone. Ramprasad Sen\n\n51\n\n\"What Kind of a Mother Are You?\" Cries of Complaint\n\nPoems in which devotees tease, criticize, or roundly abuse the Goddess for her behavior and appearance are among the most lively and interesting of the Sakta PadavalT corpus. She is indicted on four major counts: she does not live up to the promises inherent in her various names—the Compassionate, the Thoughtful, the Giver of Food, and so on; she exhibits none of the virtues proper to a mother, who is not supposed to show favoritism in her treatment of her children; she appears to have inherited all of the hard-heartedness of her stony father, the Himalaya Mountain; and she does not dress or behave in a fashion befitting a demure wife and mother. What makes all of these deceptions worse, say the poets, is that Siva and the various scriptures have claimed that she is otherwise, leading devotees into false worship. Many of the bhanitas, conclude with bitterness and sarcasm; no one would worship this Goddess if there were an alternative. Even the most pungent comments, however, belie a deeper commitment. In spite of her demeanor, the poets refuse to let go of their Goddess, crying that, if nothing else, their steadfast devotion to her kinder side will save them in the end. As such, it is they who are the moral victors in these particular songs. It is a point of some contention in the Bengali secondary literature as to whether one should interpret these poems as indicating the material circumstances of their composers. How much experience did Ramprasad have with the workings of a law court, or with land sale agreements in country estates? Was he really poor and hungry? Was Kamalakanta in constant pain? Although we will never know for sure, due to the paucity of surviving historical information, it seems safest to assume that these were poetic conceits, metaphors and images drawn from the world at large to illustrate spiritual doubts and yearnings.\n\n38\n\nI'll die of this mental anguish. My story is unbelievable;\n\n52\n\nwhat will people say when they hear it? The son of the World-Mother is dying of hunger pangs! The one You keep in happiness, is he Your favorite child? Am I so guilty that I can't even get a little salt with my spinach? You called and called me, took me on Your lap, and then dashed my heart on the ground! Mother, You have acted like a true mother; people will praise You. Rampmsad Sen\n\n39 Let me tell You a thing or two,Tara, about suffering. Who says You're Compassionate to the Wretched? Ma, to some You give wealth and family; they win battles with chariots and elephants. Others have the fortune to be day laborers unable to get spinach with their meal. Some live in buildings— I also wish for that. Ma, are they so terribly respect-worthy and I a mere nothing? Some wear two shawls, and eat their rice with sweet yoghurt. Others are destined for sandy spinach and parched rice mixed with husks. Some get carried on palanquins; I bear burdens.\n\n53\n\nMa, what have I done? Spoiled Your ripe harvest with my rake? Prasad says, Because I forget You I burn in pain. Ma, I wish I were the dust under Your fear-dispelling feet. Rdmpmsdd Sen\n\n40\n\nWhat shall I say to You, Sankari? I am speechless at Your behavior. You play the part of the World-Mother, but Your son has no clothes.Worse, You dance on that corpse Siva engrossed in Your own thoughts. I have so many sad things to say: my Mother is the Queen of the Universe, but me She has made a coolie bearing loads in the meaningless marketplace of the world. You may not be ashamed of this, but / am dying of shame. Premik says, This naked Mother of mine ruins me through shame. You have given me so much pain, Ma, but still I forget it all, stillIcallYou:\"MaMa!\" Where else shall I stand? I'll stop all this sulking; just listen, Ma, Mountain's Daughter: if I can die with \"Kali!\" on my lips, I'll split the brahmarandhra and be free. Mahendrandth Bhattdcdrya\n\n54\n\n41 Let's be girls, Ma, and play with dolls; come into my playroom. I will take the Mother's role, so I can teach You how. If You make one dull or wretched, hold him to Your bosom; who else will ease his pain? One who gets no jewels and gems, Ma, at least should get his mother. Some will be quite naughty, others lie about inside their homes, but all play games of hide-and-seek (our world here has no death, Ma), crying as they leave at night, returning with the morning. This little boy, You made him cry You made him fear. Now love away his fear, cease to make him cry— or casting You aside he'll run away. When this play is finished lull him into sleep; hold him in Your arms. Najrul Islam\n\n42 Kali,You have removed all my difficulties. Whatever the Lord has written in my destiny You have the power to fulfill it or change it. If You are merciful to someone\n\n55\n\nhe shines with a supernatural luster. He wears a loin cloth below his waist, ashes on his body and matted hair on his head. A cremation ground makes him happy; he has no interest in a house of jewels. That master is like You— always grinding the siddhi plant. Whether You keep me happy or sad, will I gain making caustic comments? I chose to be branded; can I wipe off the mark now? You have proclaimed throughout the world that Kamalakanta is Kali's son. But what kind of behavior is this between Mother and son? Who can understand it? Kamalakanta Bhattdcdtya\n\n43 Victory toYogendra'sWife, Great Illusion! Your glory is limitless! I've heard that just once if someone shouts \"Durga Durga Durga!\" You take him across the sea of becoming. So here I am at the shore of the world shouting \"Durga Durga Durga!\" in my distress. But where is Durga, Ma? Where is She? If You aren't partial to Your child, Ma, and don't show me mercy, then Your heart's a stone, Uma. Is this the way a Mother acts? Because I -was a bad son You became a bad Mother—what a fate! But I guess You're acting in character\n\n56\n\nbeing born into a family of stones. Oh Compassionate One! Today will You show mercy? When, and to whom, have You ever been kind? Oh Syama, All-Destroyer, I know what concentrating on Your feet does to a man: Brahma became a celibate with a staff, Sri Hari abandoned everything to float on a sea of milk, and Siva vacated His golden Kashi, taking up residence at a crematorium in renouncer's clothes! Only Your name is Compassion. You are empty of it. Ma.You were Daksa's daughter once. You went to his sacrifice, but when You saw Siva's absence,You got so insulted, aggrieved, that You broke up the proceedings. You weren't very nice to Your royal father. You killedYourself and also him without a thought for his feelings. At Daksa's house an insult to that man upset You enough to leave Your body. Now You stand on His chest, Uma, Hard-hearted. Whether You save me or don't, I'll use Your virtues myself to cross over, with the boat of Durga s name. I'll keep it in excellent repair. At the end, when Death comes before my breathing stops I'll cry out \"Durga! Durga!\" But Ma.Your sadhanas unappealing; •whoever does it becomes poor. Even if you call onTara once you sink.This is not a Mother's behavior!\n\n57\n\nMa, at the end, in his war with Raghunatha, Ravana the King called out to Durga. But You didn't look at him or think of his suffering; You destroyed him, Bhagavati; You were mean to a devotee. And to finish things up, You burned his lineage not one saved. He thought he had no cause for fear; he played the kettledrum: \"Victory to Kali!\"— that drum was so brilliant— but You feignedYour feelings and burned his golden Lanka to the ground. Oh Compassionate One! When, and to whom, have You ever been kind? Anthony Saheb\n\n44 From now on, don't deprive me any more.Tara. Look, the danger of death is near. What You've done to me was appropriate. I endured, it endured. But now I must think: what is the recourse for a wretched man? Death is not conquered, But I am not afraid; I only worry lest I forget Your name at my going. Even though Kamalakanta is in pain, he will smile. Otherwise people will say You haven't given me any happiness, Syama. Kamalakanta Bhattacarya\n\n58\n\n45 Tara.You are Cintamayi, Full of Thought, but do You ever give me a thought? In name You Worry for the World, but Your behavior is something else! At dawn You make me think of the day's troubles, at mid-day I concentrate on my stomach, at night, on my bed, I worry about everything. Speak to me, Ma; I'm always calling You: at first I thought I hadYou— the One Who Becomes What One Thinks Who Surpasses All Thought but then You lost all thought for Sambhucandra, and gave him the slip. Kumar Sambhucandra Ray\n\n46\n\nTara, what more are You planning? Oh Ma, will You keep giving me the same comforts You've furnished in the past? If Siva tells the truth why should I have to appease You? Ma, oh Ma, You deceive me, and then deceive me again; my right eye throbs in vain. If I had any other shelter I'd never entreat You. Ma, oh Ma, You gave me hope, then abandoned me— helping me up a tree before snatching the ladder away.\n\n59\n\nPrasad says, There's no doubt in my mind: Daksinakali is extremely severe. Ma, oh Ma, my life is over, done for; I've paidYou my fee. Ramprasad Sen\n\n47\n\nI know, I know, Mother: You're a woman of stone. You dwell inside me, yet You hide from me. Displaying Your illusory power, You create many bodies, with Your three qualities limiting the limitless. Kind to some, harmful to others, You cover Your own fault by shifting the blame to others. Mother, I don't hope for enlightenment, nor do I wish to live in heaven. I just want to visualize Your feet standing in my heart. Oh Goddess Filled with Brahman, this is Kamalakanta's humble appeal: why do You harass him unnecessarily? What is Your intention? Kamalakanta Bhattacarya\n\n48\n\nCan someone called Daughter of a Stone have compassion in Her heart?\n\n60\n\nIf She weren't pitiless, could She kick Her husband in the chest? The world knows You as the Compassionate, but there isn't a trace of compassion inYou.You wear a necklace of heads, cut from other mothers' sons! The more I cry \"Ma Ma!\" the more though I know You hear me You don't listen. Prasad gets kicked for no reason. Still he calls out \"Durga!\" Rampmsdd Sen\n\n49 Your behavior proves how stingy You are, Ma. You always give to Your devotees— or so I've heard from the Agamas. You who gave rise to the world, tell me—what didYou give to whom? In the very act of giving You bind people in the net of illusion and give them pain. I've heard Your name Full of Food but that Trident-Bearer is a beggar! He was so hungry He had to eat poison— naked, with nothing on! If You're really Kubera's Mother, as people say, why do You have a necklace of bones at Your throat?\n\n61\n\nOh Goddess draped with the snakes of death, the extent of Your riches is well known. Premik says, Oh Ma Kali, it hurts me to say this: I don't want money, Syama, so since You can't give me any it's all right. But You aren't even able to grant me Your vision! Mahendmnath Bhattdcdrya\n\n50 Ma, I've drunk Your poisoned nectar and now I'm set to die staggering, horrified by Your many forms, All-Destroyer. I think on Kali's name alas! and sink with all my hopes of happiness deep into a black pond's black waters. Presuming it nectar I dove into poison most deadly and burn in its blaze. Ma.You used to live in Haras house; You were Uma, the Mountain's Daughter. Now I see Your bloody sword, Woman with the Wild Hair, and turn black in fear. I thought You removed fear, so I made a home on the burning grounds. But what is this You have done to Dinram, Ma, appearing as the All-Destroyer? I took shelter with You; I craved fearlessness. But I'm dying of fear. Dinram\n\n62\n\n51 I'm not a child any more, Syama; now I'm Kali. I'D grasp Your sword of knowledge, and show You the fear of death! That necklace of skulls I'll snatch from Your neck to wear on my own. With a blazing passion igniting the cremation grounds I'll dance and clap my hands. Darkness I'll build out of pain; then You'll see how deeply I suffer. I'll decorate Your body with fire, Ma, burning from my three afflictions. If Siva is so compassionate, how come You're so unkind? I'm going to pinch Your basket full of offerings and give You an empty one instead. Bhadre'svar Mandal\n\n52\n\nOut of love for You I have put aside my passions. You're a brazen woman making love in the dominant position. You've got no shame, no clothes, andYour hair flies all over the place. It is You, All-Destroyer, who sets fire to creation. I smear my body •with the ash from those cinders that disgrace. In the eye of time passion is a fleeting illusion. It rises on Tuesday and sets on Saturday. Dinram investigates these things and puts his passions aside.\n\n63\n\nLet me stand at Your feet, Ma, the only place that truly exists. Dmram\n\n53\n\nMa, if You wore a Benarasi sari and tied up Your hair, You'd look so good— and there'd be no harm in it, Ma, no harm at all. If instead of standing on Daddy You sat next to Him, exchanging Your fearful form for a sweet smile, if there were no blood smeared on Your body, You'd look so good— and there'd be no harm in it, Ma. What if Forgetful Daddy didn't lie like a corpse at Your feet but spoke to You honeyed words? Think how nice that would be! The whole world I am sure would be astonished: Siva and Kali are playing new games such an improvement! You'd look so good— and there'd be no harm in it, Ma. Ma Basanti CakmbarttT\n\n54\n\nI have learned: Kali's court is extremely unfair. Someone's always shouting \"Accuser! Complainant!\" but nobody ever shows up. 64\n\nHow do you explain a court where th"
