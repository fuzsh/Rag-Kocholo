        "text": "Tribute to Harry Belafonte- A true giant, a voice for the voiceless, who walked here in my lifetime\n\nYour life, every aspect of it, was like the mythical Philosopher’s Stone-\n\nThe Paras Pathar, as we call it in India, and on which our own\n\nCreative giant, Satyajit, made a film, cast in black and white, as does\n\nYour life story, very black and white, near mythical.\n\nTutored as I was from age ten or earlier, by my Bengali housewife Mother\n\nIn a corner of India- about MLK, the scourge of slavery and the brutal\n\nRacism of America, MLK’s Dream- my knowledge, awareness and\n\nEmpathy multiplied tenfold once I actually arrived on these shores\n\nAnd the evidence was everywhere, in documentaries, in the books,\n\nIn everyday life (the resistance to the MLK birthday started a chapter).\n\nAs little as I knew the true, ghastly face of the much-glorified\n\nUnited States (including vague notions at best of their atrocities in\n\nVietnam, then in full swing)- I recall being totally enraptured by one Voice-\n\nA voice of molten gold, a voice which bespoke of Jamaica and Calypso,\n\nIts humanity, unrestrained rapture, bespoke of a long-oppressed people\n\nSeeking freedom and salvation. Harry- even at a great distance, know\n\nYou reached untold millions worldwide, a bridge to humanity\n\nSo many such as myself caught the contagion of your lyrics- lyrics\n\nWhich brought out the agonies of oppressed hearts with unsurpassed\n\nPoignancy- Come Mr. Tally-man, Tally me banana; Daylight come and we\n\nWant go home. Then, as I grew closer to the history of the Civil Rights\n\nStruggle and its glorious icons- I gradually became aware of your own\n\nConsistent, inviolable participation in those history-making events-\n\nSelma, Montgomery, so many others. Yours was not to simply revel\n\nIn the glow of your epochal music; your purpose was much higher-\n\nYour heart and soul resonated with unmatched closeness to the Cause-\n\nYou joined ranks with MLK, Malcolm, Ali, the other luminant ones\n\nA great wave of reawakening, there was- and, with your Calypso\n\nYou brought an entirely different dimension to the Great Struggle.\n\nYet, beyond your uplifting Caribbean melodies, you entered the\n\nInnermost recesses of my heart via your utterly soulful, supremely\n\nStirring, Negro Spirituals. I must confess that even though I had long\n\nAdmired the incomparable Paul Robeson in years earlier, and the likes\n\nOf Mahalia Jackson- my first encounter with several Negro Spirituals\n\nCarried on your golden, deeply soulful voice, left an imprint to this\n\nDay indelible inside my being. Those songs opened an entirely new\n\nVista for me- I realized suddenly that here was an astonishing creation\n\nBy long-oppressed Black freedom seekers which actually uses the\n\nChristian imagery, but very differently indeed- most effectively\n\nEstablishing the brutality and inhumanity of those who shriek\n\nThe name of Christ the loudest. The contrast is absolutely deafening\n\nTo any awakened mind. Yet, not in one single place in these supreme\n\nCompositions do I ever find any hatred, bitterness or vengefulness-\n\nWhich would all have been otherwise perfectly justifiable. These\n\nCompositions offering solace to the oppressed, degraded and enslaved\n\nReach a level of nobility and grace which approach in my personal\n\nExperience, only the sublime bhakti songs of Ramprasad, Kamalakanta\n\nAnd Mirabai, and perhaps the Brahma Sangeet of Tagore. If, perchance\n\nYour incomparable Caribbean melodies were to be lost to the world-\n\nMy utmost prayer would be that your spirituals survive- for they are\n\nThe embodiment of the noblest yearnings of the enslaved human,\n\nAnywhere, triumphing in the domain of the mind over the ruthless\n\nSlave-Masters and human traffickers. I recall meeting your one-time\n\nFellow “marcher to freedom,” the Reverend James Bevel at an anti-war\n\nForum at Eastern Michigan University, protesting the criminal invasion\n\nOf Iraq, early 2004, and noticing how much he was immediately drawn\n\nTo a volume of Tagore’s English writings dealing with the human\n\nWasteland that was colonialism and its imperial counterpart. Of all\n\nThe human cries against imperial rampage- in East Asia, the\n\nMiddle East, Latin America, Africa, and of course here in the imperial\n\nHeadquarters, the US of A, almost forever in league with colonialists\n\nAnd profiteers- I feel the deepest cries of anguish from enslaved\n\nAfricans are by far the most heart-rending. Harry- the muted\n\nMessages of that anguish in your spirituals find their voice in Tagore’s\n\nImmortal Africa. Along with Paul Robeson at the forefront,\n\nBob Marley and other seekers of freedom- you have relentlessly lent\n\nYour voice to humanity seeking freedom, right through the freshest\n\nImperial rampages of the new millennium, including Iraq and Libya.\n\nI think I heard him say- take my mother home.\n\nThis imagined cry from an agonized Christ about to be crucified-\n\nSo closely approaches the deepest apprehension of a mother’s\n\nBursting heart witnessing the (enslaved) son’s brutal degradation.\n\nBring a little water, Sylvie, bring a little water- now!\n\nPicture the enslaved prisoner (still many victims of racism today)\n\nCrying out for drops of water to soothe their parched lips. And\n\nThere is always the compassionate woman ready to reach out.\n\nThere’s joy in my father’s house.\n\nThe Father’s (heavenly or here on earth) house is the ultimate refuge.\n\nAnd the joy therein is exactly replicated in Tagore’s most uplifting\n\nAji shubhadine pitar bhabane amrita sadane cholo jai.\n\nMatilda- she take me money and run Venezuela.\n\nAnd your music was not all other-worldly- they were a product\n\nOf everyday life- humor, irony, deceit, perplexity- it covered\n\nThe gamut. Here a hapless fellow gets conned by a wily woman.\n\nThe woman piaba and the man piaba.\n\nWithin which you laid out the ultimate truth- the very best of\n\nOur human compatriots know not the answer to many fundamental\n\nQuestions – and not limited to only “’bout the bird and bee.”\n\nJump in the line, rock your body in time (shake, senora).\n\nAnd there, unforgettably, was young rebel Winona Ryder\n\nFloating effortlessly over the staircase railing, rocking her body\n\nIn time. Whether in Beetlejuice, or a hundred other places-\n\nHarry, you ruled the roost, time and again. Your creativity and\n\nIts vibrancy knew no limits. You brought untold joy and positive\n\nAffirmation, while within the sanctum sanctorum, your spirit\n\nWas crushed by the persistent, grave injustice haunting our world.\n\nIn their younger years, I introduced my son and daughter to your\n\nMore popular melodies- the Jamaica Farewell, Mama Look a Boo Boo,\n\nMore. Your soulful spirituals I hope they will discover on their own-\n\nThe searching spirit often finds them naturally.\n\nYet, inexorably, the time for the great Farewell has now arrived\n\nAnd, left with a world impoverished by your absence- gone from us\n\nAre Poitier, Vidal, Tutu, Zinn and many shining lights- all we have left\n\nIs the wish- come back Harry, come back in all your glory\n\nWith you there is no Farewell; come back to this verdant earth\n\nWhere, with all its kinks, Life flourishes.\n\nRamprasad Sen- Bengali devotional composer and poet (1718/23-1775).\n\nKamalakanta- Bengali devotional composer, yogi, poet (1769-1821).\n\nMirabai- 16th century Princess of Rajputana, who became a devout servant of Krishna.\n\nAji shubhadine, pitar bhabane, amrita sadane cholo jai-\n\nOn this auspicious day, let us proceed to Our Father’s House of Eternal Life. Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941), Brahma Sangeet.\n\nDr. Monish R. Chatterjee, a professor at the University of Dayton who specializes in applied optics, has contributed more than 130 papers to technical conferences, and has published more than 70 papers in archival journals and conference proceedings, in addition to numerous reference articles on science. He has also authored several literary essays and four books of literary translations from his native Bengali into English (Kamalakanta, Profiles in Faith, Balika Badhu, and Seasons of Life), and contributed to several literary anthologies. Dr. Chatterjee believes strongly in humanitarian activism for social justice.\n\nURLs for HB songs discussed:\n\nTake my mother home:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNbAi12eBGY\n\nBring a little water, Sylvie:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZVc1Yew3tk\n\nIn my Father’s house:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A3aYtuFAiI\n\nMatilda:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZVc1Yew3tk\n\nThe woman piaba and the man piaba\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvN6-RK66Bo\n\nJump in the line\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU9TxckCXMc\n\nMonish R Chatterjee, © May, 2023"
