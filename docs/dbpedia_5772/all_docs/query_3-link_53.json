        "text": "Dale discusses healing the heart and staying on the path to God.\n\nOn this episode of Healing at the Edge, Dale talks about staying motivated in our practice, how we deal with suffering, and healing the heart with compassion.\n\nThe Path (Opening)\n\nThe goal of all yoga is to merge with God. Dale discusses how death puts people in that direct relationship with God. He asks us what blocks our heart and prevents us from dying into love.\n\nDale challenges our fear of death where we identify with our separateness.\n\n“If we really take that as a contemplation into the core of our bones, that we are going to die, but we don’t know when, then it can really add a deep sense of passion and aliveness to our practice, to our meditation, to our saying of mantra.”\n\nMotivation to Practice (7:00)\n\nDale talks about the hurdles we face in our practice. He discusses the strong motivations we need to keep us focused.\n\nDealing with Suffering (14:45)\n\nDale discusses the three possibilities of how to deal with suffering. We tend to push away suffering or get lost in it. There is a third possibility, of meeting suffering with compassion and an open heart. When suffering arises, it is an opportunity to surrender more into love.\n\n“Nothing is a mistake. What we are experiencing now is exactly what you and I need for our next step in healing our heart, in merging into the oneness that is truly who we are.”\n\nDying into Compassion (22:00)\n\nCompassion can be expressed in two ways. Dale discusses these aspects of compassion. Our true nature is to have compassion for all things in all ways.\n\nQuestions from the Audience (36:15)\n\nDale takes questions from a live audience. In addition to sharing how he began teaching, he discusses how to demonstrate compassion without offending and talks about the meaning of the following Ramprasad Sen poem:\n\nTaking the name of Kali,\n\nDive deep, O mind,\n\nInto the heart’s fathomless depths,\n\nWhere many a gem lies hid\n\nDive deep and make your way\n\nTo Mother Kali’s realm."
