        "text": "Home > Author > Ramprasad Sen\n\nAuthor: Ramprasad Sen\n\nRamprasad Sen was born in 1718, he was a Hindu Shakta poet and saint of eighteenth-century Bengal. His bhakti poems, known as Ramprasadi, are still popular in Bengalâ€”they are usually addressed to the Hindu goddess Kali and written in Bengali. It is said that Ramprasad was born into a Bengali Baidya Brahmin family and showed an inclination towards poetry from an early age. He was highly influenced by Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric scholar and yogi. Ramprasad became well-known for his devotional songs. He is credited with creating a new compositional form that combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical melodies and kirtan. The new style took root in Bengali culture with many poet-composers combining folk and raga-based melodies, mixing every common style of music from classical to semi-classical and folk.\n\nALL Books\n\nShort By"
