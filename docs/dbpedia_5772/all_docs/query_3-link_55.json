        "text": "(Published in the November 2018 issue of Samaj Sangbad)\n\nWho in this world can understand what Mother Kali really is?\n\nThe six systems of philosophy remain powerless to describe Her.\n\nShe is the inmost awareness of the sage who realizes that Consciousness alone exists.\n\nShe is the life blossoming within the creatures of the universe.\n\nBoth macrocosm and microcosm are lost within Mother’s Womb.\n\nNow can you sense how indescribable She is?\n\nThe yogi meditates upon Her in the six subtle nerve centers as She sports with delight through the lotus wilderness of the pristine human body, playing with Her Consort, Shiva, the Great Swan.\n\nWhen anyone attempts to know Her, the singer of this song laughs.\n\nCan you swim across a shoreless ocean?\n\nYet the child in me still reaches out to touch the moon.\n\n~ Ramprasad Sen, Mother Kali Devotee, Tantric, Musician and the composer of Kalikirtan\n\nWe fear what we don’t understand, we fear what is unknown, hidden and that which is dark. In that fear, the Father who is Eternal Light, the Purusha, the Atma swarupa can no longer help us. At the moment even the Father is asleep and the Vedas call that moment of life, that moment of the day as Ratri, the Dark Night.\n\nIn that moment of helplessness, in that moment of utter desperation, we cry out for help. At that moment, the mind is clouded by dark thoughts of depression, addiction, malice and under the grip of our very dark self-called Papa purusha.\n\nThe Father and the other Gods don’t even wish to touch us then; they consider us at that point of time, so impure, so corrupted that they don’t even wish to cast their divine grace on us. Society has forsaken us; we are deep in sin and under the terrible affliction of mind.\n\nWho can help us then in the pothole of darkness? Will any Divine being dare to come down and lift us up in this condition of mental existence? Rituals mean nothing to me, mantras and shastras mean nothing, I am just looking for some consolation, some affection, some hope.\n\nIt is at this moment that only the Mother wakes up, just as our physical mother did late in the night to clean us of our excretion as we were so helpless even to know when to do what. It is in that mood, the Mother out of sheer mercy decides to fight a battle for us. This is a battle to free our minds in the deepest and darkest hour of desperation, a battle to free us from bondage.\n\nIn doing so, dirt from our karma gets wiped on her body. We are such children that we throw tantrums and tear her garments. We spit on the very Mother who is trying to clean us from our own excretion where we rot. Such babies, we are since we are deeply surrounded by the clouds of ignorance.\n\nShe is dark because she has tried to clean our karmic excretion and in the process taken it upon Herself.\n\nShe is naked because while she was trying to help us, our own negativity was cutting her clothes but she didn’t care.\n\nTaking mercy on our child-like mind, she forgave us. She is holding the head of our egos and arms and legs of our passions. She is trying to clean us of our karma and we are fighting the very cleansing that will help us.\n\nShe is then left with no other option but to cut our very attachment to senseless ego we have in order to save us.\n\nShe stands on the Father because if she doesn’t keep Him fixed, the soul will leave the body. The Father as our atma is still as the Mother is cleaning the body. The Father is also asleep since it is the darkest night but She cannot let him go since it will lead to the death of her very children she is trying to save.\n\nShe knows if she has to use her arms to clean her babies, she only has her legs to connect with the spirit. She knows the world will frown upon her posture – dark, naked woman, stamping her own husband but She is certain of her duty, her unconditional love for her children.\n\n“I have to clean them from their karmic excretion. If I don’t, they have no one else to look upon”, says She in utter compassion. Such is Her mercy that She is ready to fight with the world for the sake of Her affection for us.\n\nVishnu admits that He doesn’t completely understand Her. Brahma admits that He couldn’t begin creation without Her Blessings. Shiva admits that although She is Her consort, He is dead without Her."
