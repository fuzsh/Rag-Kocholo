The rest of the site, besides forums, has been closed down and visitors with questions are encouraged to send emails to sagetv-dev@google.com.\n\nSageTV is a mediacenter and Slingbox type of product in one. It isn’t immediately certain how Google will use SageTV but adding its Tivo-like recording capability to GoogleTVand the Google Cloud would certainly be interesting. Placeshifting technology (Slingbox) would also be a compelling technology for GoogleTVs to get into.\n\n40.714513-74.005122\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More."
