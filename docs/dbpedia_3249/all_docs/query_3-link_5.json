Before you get too excited though, this wonder box isn't perfect, but you'll just have to click on through to learn all about that.\n\n%Gallery-42656%\n\nSageTV\n\nDedicated media streamers are a dime a dozen these days and then add in all the other devices around the house that can streams pictures, music, and videos to the big screen, and your options gets down right out of hand. So the thing that makes the HD Theater so attractive is the SageTV tie in. If you haven't been keeping up, SageTV is DVR software that might be the De Facto standard of DVR software for geeks. While it doesn't include the snazzy UI that Windows Media Center has, it makes up for it in features. It was the first DVR software to work with the sought after component capture device from Hauppauge; the HD PVR. It features just about every item on any DVR software fan's wish list like built-in placeshifting (think Slingbox), transcoding, and software extenders. Both the server and the client will run on just about every platform out there including; Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows Home Server -- something Windows Media Center fans would die for. And finally it is fully customizable and skinnable. To put it simply, it rocks. One example of what gets us so excited is that you can take an old computer around the house with almost no processing power, throw a couple of HD tuners on it and a big hard disk, then connect the HD Theater to your HDTV in your home theater to let it do all the heavy lifting.\n\nThe Good\n\nWorks as as Sage Extender and as a stand-alone streamer.\n\nPlays every codec we can think of.\n\nThe box is nice and small.\n\nIts silent.\n\nIncluded HDMI cable is very appreciated.\n\nFront and rear USB ports are a great addition to plug in your own content quickly or permanently.\n\nOnline services are useful, but can't wait for the Hulu support that was demoed at CES.\n\nBoth Dolby Digital and DTS played back great via HDMI from MKV files -- no DTS-HD or TrueHD though.\n\nPlaying media from the USB drive is just as good as playing over the network, useful for those without network connectivity behind the TV.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe included remote isn't programmable so it can't turn on your TV.\n\nNo built in WiFi or available dongle.\n\nHad trouble running setup with HDMI, had to switch to component until after the initial setup.\n\nShows network share passwords on certain screens, not cool.\n\nMedia browsing isn't snappy, but it isn't slow either.\n\nMore difficult than it should be to switch from extender mode to stand-alone (power cycle required).\n\nNo coax digital output.\n\nBrowsing files with the \"imported File browser\" if functional, but in no way enjoyable.\n\nThere were like 60 Imported file locations already on the review unit, which made it difficult to find the ones that actually existed. To top it off, deleting them one by one is a tedious affair.\n\nLEDs are too bright and the network one blinks too much.\n\nNo animated transitions or translucent menus in the user interface."
