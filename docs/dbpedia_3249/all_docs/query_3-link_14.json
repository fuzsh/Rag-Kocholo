        "text": "I created this list because:\n\nI’m frequently asked for technology recommendations and decided to keep a consolidated and updated list.\n\nI wanted to speed-up my software download/install process when setting up a new computer.\n\nI’ve personally tested everything on this list and feel all of it offers the best performance for the price.\n\nMany of the software products are free and open source; the developers deserve more recognition than I can give them this is a start.\n\nHome Theater Hardware:\n\nHigh-End Video Projector: In the $5,000 price range and above, I prefer anything from the JVC D-ILA line. This is what I use at home. JVC offers unsurpassed black levels, good brightness, amazing picture detail. I prefer JVC to similarly priced Sony projectors due to the superior native contrast ratio and better black level that JVC offers.\n\nBudget Video Projector:\n\nBenQ HT2050 DLP Projector (if your budge is less than $1,000)\n\nEpson 5040UB (if your budget is less than $2,500) Home Cinema projector.\n\nProjection Screen: Sliver Ticket screens offer great performance at fantastically low prices. They produce very similar performance to the Stewart Firehawk screen that I paid almost 8-times as much to purchase. The Stewart is still better, but it’s difficult for me to recommend based on the huge price difference.\n\nI recommend the white screen to give the best image quality in a perfectly dark room\n\nI cautiously recommend the silver screen when more brightness is needed (due to low-brightness projector), but these higher-gain screens tend to “hot spot” with a noticeable brigher sparkley spot in the center of screen.\n\nPurchase the screen in a 16:9 aspect ratio because that matches the native aspect ratio of all projectors. Adding lenses or messing with zooming for each movie or show you watch is more trouble than it’s worth.\n\nHigh-end Flat Panel TV: LG OLED TVs offer the absolute best picture quality due to infinite contrast ratio. They’re also impossibly thin.\n\nBudget Flat Panel TV: TCL 6-series (2018) For around $650 for the 55-inch model, TCL LED-backlit LCD TVs offer fantastic performance. They have Roku as the built-in user interface, which is better than pretty much every other TV user interface option, and also support HDR10 and Dolby Vision. For the price, the can’t be beat.\n\nSubwoofers: Subwoofers completely transform the movie-watching and music-listening experience. Aside from the front left/center/right speakers, subs are the most critical components of a speaker system. Subs can also be very difficult to properly setup, because low frequencies have very long wave lengths, which result in standing wave patterns within a room as the sounds reflect off of the walls. The results is that some frequencies are very loud at one seating position and very quiet at another. With subwoofers, the room is a critical component of the speaker, and you need to match the sub to the room. Here’s what I feel are the 2 essential steps for great sub performance:\n\nUse at least 2 subs placed in opposite corners of the room\n\nUse a receiver with room correction (such as Audyssey XT32 or Anthem Room Correction – see below for receivers)\n\nBudget Subwoofers (smaller rooms): Remember that 2 subs significantly improve subwoofer sound quality throughout a room. It’s often better to 2 budget subs that it is to have 1 higher-end subwoofer. A pair of BIC America F12 Subwoofers ($220 each) will give very strong performance for a reasonable price.\n\nHigh-End Subwoofers (larger rooms): SVS Subwoofers are amazing. They have some really great software config and turning options. They also offer free shipping and free return shipping. I recommend the two of the SB16-Ultra models for the ultimate subwoofer setup. Power Sound Audio subs and have nearly the same performance as SVS, fewer electronic setting options, and a lower price. HSU Research is a another brand to consider.\n\nDIY Subwoofers: If you have the time and skill, you can build an amazing subwoofer system that surpasses commercial offerings, but they require building large or special enclosures. Infinite Baffle subwoofers offer the best low frequency response; Horn-loaded subs offer the highest output (highest efficiency.) Here are details on my Infinite Baffle subwoofer installation.\n\nFront Left/Center/Right Speakers: There are many brands of speakers that produce a natural, neutral sound that works extremely well for home theater. If you have a small, enclosed room, bookshelf speakers are all you need as they can sound just as good as towers. If you have a large room, tower speakers will play at the higher volume required to fill the space. Here are some brands I recommend considering:\n\nRBH Sound: These are probably my favorite speakers overall. Great performance across all of their speaker line. Available online from their website.\n\nSVS: They make more than just great subwoofers. The Prime speakers are fantastic for the price, the Ultra series sounds even better. They are available internet direct from their website – plus they have free shipping and free return shipping – you have no excuse not to try these out in your listening room.\n\nKEF: The KEF Q-series of speakers are another fantastic option. They have several other speaker lines the cost significantly more; the Q-series is much more affordable and offers most of the performance of their higher-end lines.\n\nAperion Audio: The guys at AV Rant keep talking about how great these speakers are. Like SVS, they offer free return shipping. Why wouldn’t you try them out?\n\nFavorite Retail Brands: Paradigm and B&W are two of my favorite retail brands. You can’t go wrong with them. I’m not sure they offer the price/performance ratio of the other alternatives listed above. If you want to listen to speakers in a retail store and purchase them at a retails store, you can’t go wrong with either or these options.\n\nSurround Sound Speakers: For home theater, don’t waste your money on premium surround sound speakers! They play ambient sounds and are positioned behind and/or above you. Cheap speakers sound just the same as extremely expensive speakers. It doesn’t matter if your surrounds are the same brand as your front speakers – you don’t need to timbre-match surround sound speakers. On-wall speakers are great if you don’t mind seeing the speakers and you don’t want want to cut holes in your walls or ceiling. Beale Street Audio are a great in-wall/in-ceiling option because they include integrated baffle boxes that keep the sound from propagating behind the drywall to adjacent rooms.\n\nHome Theater A/V receiver: The latest and highest-end Denon Receiver. Due to the continual progression of technology, pretty much any receiver you buy is going to sound equally impressive as any other. There is no longer any need for separate external amplifiers; all amplifiers sound fantastic. The only differentiator between receiver options is the list of features it supports. These are the features that I think are most important:\n\nBrands: Option 1: Denon and Marantz are same company and the receivers are essentially the same between the two; get which ever one is the better price. Yamaha is a also a very strong option, but generally costs slightly more vs. comparable Denon offerings. Onkyo and Pioneer are the same company, but I think you’re better off with either Denon/Marantz or Yamaha. Anthem AV is the best upgrade option.\n\nRoom Correction: Don’t buy a receiver that doesn’t have room correction – it delivers significant improvements in bass reproduction. Audyssey MultEQ is a the minimum starting point, but I think Audyssey MultEQ XT32 is much better. Anthem Room Correction is the best room correction software available. If you can afford an Anthem receiver, it will deliver results that surpass XT32 – it’s what I use in my home theater.\n\nHigh Dynamic Range Color (HDR): Make sure the receiver supports the pass-through of High Dynamic Range color. HDR10 and DolbyVision are the two HDR specs you should target. So HDMI 2.1b or higher spec.\n\nDolby Atmos and DTS-X Height Speakers: These two surround sound formats add ceiling-mounted height speakers to the tradition 7.1 speaker setup, which consists of front left/front center/front right + side left/right surround + rear left/right surround + subwoofer. In my opinion, you don’t get a huge amount of benefit from the height speakers. A receiver that supports these formats is nice to have, but I don’t think it’s worth the upgrade alone.\n\n4k Resolution Support: 4K doesn’t offer nearly as much of a picture quality benefit as does HDR. but 4k is required to get HDR color.\n\nUniversal Remote Control: Logitech Harmony One Ultimate. I like that it is a remote with physical buttons that click, has an RF base station so you don’t have to aim it at components, and it also has an iOS/Android app that offers the same features as the dedicated remote.\n\nSurge Protection: Surge X is now the brand I recommend due to having the best surge suppression technology. But I’m still not convinced they are worth the price.\n\nHome Network Music Player: Sonos Music Player because it is so simple to use, has every feature you could want, works with every music service out there, and sounds fantastic.\n\nDVR / Movie Player: After years of After years of building my own PC-based solution, I’ve given up. It’s hard to beat an nVidia Shield TV running Plex Media Server and recording from the antenna using a SiliconDust HDHomerun Connect tuner.\n\nStand-alone Digital Video Recorder (runner-up): TiVo Bolt+ and TiVo Mini with off-the-air antenna. It just works. The advanced features that SageTV has simply aren’t there; very little functionality has been added over the past few years. But if you just want something that works and records your TV, TiVo is hard to beat.\n\nStand-alone Digital Media Player (runner-up): The Apple TV 4k is now my preferred media player because it supports Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu as well as HDR and native movie frame rates.\n\nMobile Phone:\n\nApple iPhone or Google Pixel: I recommend the simplicity, security, and integration of the iPhone vs. the flexibility and variation of the Android phones. I carry both, and you can’t go wrong with either.\n\nCored Headphones: I finally purchased a pair of Westone W5 balanced armature in-ear monitors after years of longing. They produce the most amazing sound I’ve every heard. They are extremely efficient and don”t require a separate amplifier to produce adequate volumes. Plus, the cord has a microphone and track/volume control buttons. For serious music listening, there is no substitute.\n\nCompletely Cordless Headphones: When it comes to exercising, I don’t like cords and I’m willing to sacrifice sound quality. Bragi The Headphone is the best option I’ve found so far, but I can’t recommend them without reservation. The battery life is solid at 4+ hours and the signal is steady, but the left bud seems to discharge if left setting. The sound quality is OK. The ability to pass-through external environmental sounds is useful.\n\nGeneral Computer Hardware:\n\nHome Network Router: Eero is what I recommend for most people due to it being so easy to use. But if you don’t mind spending time learning how to do configurations, Ubiquiti Unifi access points and edge routers are the way to go and are what I personally use.\n\nGeneral User Laptop: Apple MacBook Pro. I currently use a 13-inch Space Gray touchbar model.\n\nComputer Monitor: The largest Dell LCD widescreen you’re willing to afford. I currently use a Dell Ultrasharp 4k 27-inch monitor.\n\nErgonomic Mouse: I recommend this only if you have wrist/joint pain in your hand! 3M Wireless Ergonomic Optical Mouse (medium/large hand size, small hand size)\n\nDigital Camera / Photography Hardware:\n\nDaily Use Digital Camera: I hate to say is, but I use my Apple iPhone as my primary camera. It’s always with me and it’s easy to use. My D-SLR takes better pictures, but it requires more work to process them. For that reason alone, I use my iPhone more than any other camera.\n\nHigh-end Digital Camera: Any Digital SLR is almost certain to be an improvement over other options. I full-frame Nikon with the SnapBridge app transfer images to your smartphone via Bluetooth is what I with I had, along with a super-fast prime lens, wide angle lens, and zoom lens.\n\n7 Taskbar Thumbnail Customizer\n\n2006-07-30"
