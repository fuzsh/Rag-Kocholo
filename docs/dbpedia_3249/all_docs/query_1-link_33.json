        "text": "Downside: the user interface\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot below, the SageTV's software isn't going to win any beauty contests. I'm not much of a graphics guy, but I'm sure even I could've done a better job of skinning a UI than whoever these guys hired. Front Row this definitely is not.\n\nBut the fact that the UI was whacked a lick with the ugly stick isn't the biggest problem with the SageTV user experience; rather, the real issue is lag.\n\nThe guys at GeekTonic did a teardown of the SageTV in their review, and found that it sports a Sigma SMP 8635—a fairly capable media center SoC based around a 300MHz MIPS processor core. The problem is that this chip doesn't handle the UI very well.\n\nAs you navigate around the interface, there's a noticeable lag as you move from icon to icon. This lag gets much worse if you have to load a whole new screen—for instance, if you clicked on an icon or if you're entering or exiting a folder in the browser view. This screen lag makes browsing folders fairly painful, and it's the number one strike against the SageTV.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe SageTV HD Theater isn't the most polished product, especially on the software side. General interface unloveliness aside, the lag issues can be a pain. But in the final reckoning, the SageTV HD Theater really works, and so far it has been bulletproof. I don't have to worry at all about the video or audio format of any file I get—the SageTV just plays it, and that's that. I'll never go back to hassling over which OS X player to use, or which codecs to install, or how to make this or that file show up in Front Row, and so on.\n\nIf you're in the market to go from nothing to a full-blown media center with DVR capabilities, then you're going to want to shop around a bit to evaluate all your options. You may end up liking the SageTV alone or with the Media Center software, or you might want to spend more money to get a media extender with solid codec and format support that also has added features like local storage and a built-in BitTorrent client. But for someone who has a wired LAN and an existing PC or NAS that can be used as networked media storage, the SageTV HD Theater is a compact, inexpensive, and fairly fool-proof way to get media from your network onto your HDTV, without having to know the difference between AC3 and DTS."
