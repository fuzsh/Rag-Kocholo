It’s a palm sized wireless remote that has a touch pad that can be used as a mouse and various backlit buttons to control various features. It works with popular media applications including Windows Media Center, Apple iTunes, Boxee, Apple Front Row, SageTV, Firefox, and any web browser. You can buy one for $149.

The product is available for purchase from select online retailers worldwide with an MSRP of $149.\n\nThe new GlideTV Navigator, a study in modern design, reinvents the computer input device for the living room. The contrast of the highly-polished material and elegant curves is a fitting reflection of the sophisticated technology held within. The product includes a remote, charging station, USB wireless receiver and is compatible with Windows PC, Apple Mac, Sony PlayStation 3 or any set-top box that supports standard mouse and keyboard HID devices.\n\n“Up to now, consumers who wanted to connect a computer to the TV to take advantage of digital content had to bring office equipment to their living room, making the experience bulky and cumbersome,” said Chris Painter, President and founder. “With the Navigator, GlideTV brings simplicity to accessing internet-based entertainment and ushers in a new era for computing in the living room.”\n\nConsumers plug the USB wireless receiver into their PC and they’re ready to take control of their computing experience or explore the Internet with a point and a click. GlideTV Navigator works with popular media applications including Windows Media Center, Apple iTunes, Boxee, Apple Front Row, SageTV, Firefox, and any web browser.\n\nThis product features:\n\nClickable touchpad mapped to your TV screen — precise cursor control, one-thumb scrolling, single and double-click selection.\n\nBacklit AV buttons to control volume and playback.\n\nDirectional buttons for easy two-axis navigation.\n\nDedicated Esc, Enter, Back, and Function keys to control applications.\n\nOn-screen keyboard — requires download, Windows only.\n\nIntegrated search menu with links to Google, Amazon Video on Demand, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube and more — requires download, Windows only.\n\nRechargeable battery.\n\n“GlideTV nailed the customer experience,” said Aaron Burt, a beta test user who lives in the Washington DC area. “It’s a great way to control Windows Media Center in the living room and even my kids enjoy using it. GlideTV Navigator is the perfect couch-mouse.”\n\nThe product has garnered significant industry attention by winning the prestigious 2009 Best of Innovations Award at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The GlideTV team, led by Mike Machado and Christopher Painter, consists of consumer electronics and Silicon Valley technology veterans from Sony, SageTV, Slim Devices, and VUDU.\n\nGlideTV Navigator is available worldwide from select retailers and directly from the manufacturer in the US and Europe. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price is:\n\nUnited States — $149\n\nEurozone — €129 (VAT included)\n\nUnited Kingdom — £119 (VAT included)\n\nFor more information, visit www.glidetv.com.\n\nAbout GLIDETV\n\nGlideTV, Inc. is dedicated to simplifying the PC living room experience.
