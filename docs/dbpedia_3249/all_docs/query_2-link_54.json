If you are interested in SageTV or an extender, check his review out. Question for Brent, does the extender play Blu-rips in client mode?

        "text": "Setting up the HD200 as an\n\nextender is just as easy as it was for the HD100 that preceded it.\n\nPlug it in to a power outlet, connect it to the TV or AV Receiver via\n\nHDMI, Component, Composite or S-Video and then connect the audio via\n\nthe Left/Right audio jacks, optical SPDIF or HDMI. The key of course\n\nis to be sure you have SageTV Media Center software running on a\n\ncomputer in your network, set up a few firewall settings and enable the\n\nMedia Extender Server on your server. This computer can be physically\n\nlocated anywhere in your home as long as its connected to your home\n\nnetwork. I won’t go too much into SageTV as a HTPC program in this\n\nreview other than to say that it is multi-platform (XP, Vista,\n\nWindows7, Windows Home Server, Linux and Mac and SageTV is very\n\ncapable, very flexible and handles a multitude of file formats. I use\n\nit in my home as the HTPC DVR, Movie server and Music server.\n\nOnce you have the SageTV set up in and running in extender mode, you\n\ncan also customize the look and feel of the extender as well as install\n\nplugins to modify the extender as desired.."
