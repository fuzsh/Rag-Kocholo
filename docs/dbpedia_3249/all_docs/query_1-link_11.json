        "text": "Inglewood, California-based SageTV has announced on its website today that it has been acquired by Google. The rest of the site, besides forums, has been closed down and visitors with questions are encouraged to send emails to [email protected].\n\nStarted in 2002, SageTV has produced versatile DVR software that works with Mac OS X, Windows and Linux operating systems. The software makes it possible to turn almost any computer with a TV tuner card into the primary hub of a home entertainment system.\n\nIn its email to customers, SageTV explained that its store has been entirely shut down, but customer support for its DVR products “will continue.” The SageTV forum will remain up and running, the company said.\n\nIn a statement issued on the company’s site the team stated : “Since 2002, we’ve worked to change the TV viewing experience by building cutting-edge software and technology that allows you to create and control your media center from multiple devices. And as the media landscape continues to evolve, we think it’s time our vision of entertainment management grows as well. By teaming up with Google, we believe our ideas will reach an even larger audience of users worldwide on many different products, platforms and services.”\n\nGoogle’s purchase of SageTV ignites curiosity as to whether its technology (and dev team) will be used to revitalize and upgrade Google TV."
