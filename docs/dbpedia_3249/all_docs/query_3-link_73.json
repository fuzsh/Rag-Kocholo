Total investment for 'P7', which will be developed in phases, is KRW 5,297 billion. LG.Philips LCD plans to begin ramping-up 'P7' in the first half of 2006. Initially, LG.Philips LCD will implement a production capacity of 45,000 input sheets per month, gradually ramping-up to full production of 90,000 input sheets per month. This phasing of 'P7' will allow LG.Philips LCD to respond to various market conditions while better managing risk.\n\n'P7' will use 1950 x 2250mm glass substrates in the production of TFT-LCDs. As the world's largest glass substrate used so far for TFT-LCD fabrication, 1950 x 2250mm is efficient for the production of 42-inch and 47-inch wide TFT-LCDs, as well as other large and wide displays used primarily for flat TVs and large monitors. 42-inch has already become the large screen HDTV standard in many countries. Building upon its success in establishing its sixth generation TFT-LCD fabrication facility (the most efficient for 32-inch and 37-inch wide TFT LCD TV production) as an industry standard, LG.Philips LCD will establish another industry standard with the world's first seventh generation TFT-LCD factory to use 1950 x 2250mm for substrate glass. These sixth and seventh generation facilities are complementary in meeting the market standard road-map requirements for large and wide TVs of 32, 37, 42 and 47-inch wide screen displays.\n\nThe establishment of the Paju Display Cluster, which broke ground in March 2004, is progressing well with the LG.Philips LCD Paju LCD Complex under construction on the 1.65 million square meter lot allocated to LG.Philips LCD. With the launch of LG.Philips LCD's seventh generation TFT-LCD fabrication facility in 2006, the Paju Display Cluster is expected to grow into the world's premier display cluster.\n\nLG.Philips LCD is committed to its 'P7' investment. This investment will create employment opportunities and invigorate nearby TFT-LCD industry-related businesses, including component and equipment makers. There is an additional 1.98 million square meter lot in the vicinity dedicated to related display component suppliers and customers.\n\nAbout LG.Philips LCD\n\nLG.Philips LCD (NYSE: LPL, KSE: 034220) is a leading manufacturer and supplier of thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels. The Company manufactures TFT-LCD panels in a wide range of sizes and specifications primarily for use in notebook computers, desktop monitors and televisions.

Is now the time to buy?\n\nBY MICHAEL SCHUMAN\n\nDoug Gale, a 30-year-old Dallas banker, returned from a vacation to Tokyo and Hong Kong in 2001 raving as much about TV sets as about ancient temples, towering skyscrapers and exotic food. A self-proclaimed tech geek, Gale scouted out electronics shops and was mesmerized by flat-screen TVs. Their monstrous sizes, sleek designs and flashy displays were perfect, he thought, for watching his favorite Dallas Stars charge down the ice. \"I'd never seen anything like them,\" he says of the TVs. \"They were just phenomenal. As soon as I got back to Dallas I was thinking, 'I got to get me one of these!'\"\n\nThree years later, Gale's living room is still dominated by an old picture-tube clunker. He routinely stops in Best Buy and Circuit City stores to compare prices, but the model he craves, a 45-in. (114-cm) cutting-edge liquid-crystal display (LCD) TV, has a $7,000 price tag�twice what Gale is willing to spend. \"These things are still prohibitively expensive,\" Gale laments.\n\nSound familiar? While it seems as though hordes of couch potatoes are snapping up the latest displays, the wonders of LCD and plasma TV technology are still well out of reach for the average shopper. True, at U.S. retailer Circuit City, sales of flat-TV models have tripled over the past year, prompting CEO W. Alan McCollough to label this Christmas \"a flat-panel holiday.\" But as long as the price tag on a flat-screen TV is four or more times as much as a comparable tube TV, many consumers will drool and dream but not bite. \"Prices [of flat TVs] will be cheaper for consumers this holiday season, but not cheap enough to have them explode off the shelves,\" says Chris Connery, vice president of market research at DisplaySearch, a consulting firm based in Austin, Texas. more...\n\nSamsung Electronics has developed a 4-inch screen digital interface LCD with a 16:9 screen ratio exclusively for Portable Media Players (PMP).\n\nPMP is a next-generation multimedia player that can play video images downloaded from the Internet at any time, any where in a convenient format. Market anticipation for a full-scale portable video player has increased dramatically in recent months. PMP's expanded capacity allows for variety of media player features including music and video.\n\nMade exclusively for the PMP market, Samsung's 4-inch widescreen LCD with a 16:9 ratio provides an outstanding digital interface with excellent color gamut and brightness. The LCD panel used for existing PMPs is generally 3.5 inches and has 4:3 ratio. When a 16:9 Digital Internet Video eXpress (Divx) file is played in the current format, the screen is not fully utilized, particularly at the top and bottom of the screen.\n\nResearch into the most appropriate screen size has found that 4-inch screen work best. A 3-inch screen is hard to view due to its small screen size; a 5-inch screen is too large to fit into a pocket. Since a 4-inch screen offers good view-ability and is easier to carry, it is expected to meet consumers' needs. In addition, its 8-bit digital interface allows for 16.7million-color video images, and its 50 percent color gamut offers a clear and crisp image display.\n\n�We are planning to take the lead in the display industry by developing various small- and medium-size applications with advanced technology and product competitiveness,� said Yun Jin-Hyuk, senior vice president of the Mobile Display Business Team for Samsung's LCD Business. �Our goal is to take the #1 position in mobile LCD market share by year 2006.�\n\nPioneer Corp said it may put a new line of plasma televisions into production from 2008 but also sought to clarify media reports on the proposal, specifically concerning where the project will be located.\n\nPioneer spokeswoman Ema Suzuki confirmed that the company may launch a new plasma TV line, but added that comments made by Pioneer President Kaneo Ito in an interview with the Nihon Keizahi Shimbun had been misunderstood. The newspaper said Pioneer will begin work early next year on the new line but Suzuki added: 'There was a misunderstanding' concerning the line's location.\n\n'President Ito said that given that the estimated global market for plasma display TVs will grow to about 8 mln units in 2008, we have to establish a new line so as to keep the market share of about 20 pct,' she said.\n\nBut she added that contrary to the Nikkei report, which mentioned the possibility of locating operations near consumer markets, Pioneer will only manufacture the sets in Japan.\n\n'We are planning to produce plasma displays only in Japan, although some of assembling is being done at our overseas facilities,' she said.\n\nSuzuki also confirmed that Pioneer will set up a project team to develop the new line early next year, with the process taking one or two years.\n\nIn the Nikkei interview, Ito said total investment for the production line has not yet been decided, but added that it would not exceed 100 bln yen.\n\nHe said the company is looking at an annual production capacity of 500,000 plasma sets, on construction costs of some 27 bln yen. The Nikkei said the new line would raise Pioneer's total annual plasma TV production capacity by 50 pct to some 1.6 mln units. Pioneer began operating a fourth plasma line at a plant in the Yamanashi Prefecture in eastern Japan in October, after it purchased NEC Corp's plasma TV business.\n\nThe plant, which is run by the company's subsidiary, Pioneer Display Products Corp, boosted its current total production capacity from 300,000 to 1.1 mln units.\n\nMost Say HDTV Still Too Expensive\n\nConsumers are showing a reasonable knowledge of and interest in HDTV, but it is still seen by many as beyond their means, according to a recent study conducted by global survey research firm, Ipsos-Insight.\n\n\"Awareness of HDTV and understanding of the related technology, products, and services is on the rise,\" said Lynne Bartos, a leader in the company's Cable, Media & Entertainment research practice. The Ipsos-Insight study found that 89% of Americans are aware of HDTV, up from 74% in 2002. Most of those who are aware of HDTV recall seeing an ad for HDTV in the past month (88%, up from 79% two years ago), while the percentage of consumers who have never heard of HDTV has dropped from 26% to 11%.\n\n\"Advertising and marketing by industry players is getting noticed, helped in part by word of mouth and sporting events, especially the recent Athens Summer Olympic Games which were presented in high definition,\" said Bartos. \"But HDTVs are not yet in the consideration set of mainstream America. Nearly three-in-four say that HDTV is much too expensive for them to consider purchasing right now (72%, down from 76% two years ago). Other research we've conducted shows that HDTV purchase intent is flat, with 13% of Americans 'very' or 'somewhat' likely to buy HDTV in the near term, vs. 15% last year.\"\n\nAmong those who are familiar with HDTV (45%), most understand that HDTV can deliver a superior quality picture (94% \"agree\"), that HDTV comes with digital quality surround sound (87%), and that they get to watch content on a full widescreen picture (92%). Seventy percent of those who said they are familiar with HDTV also said they think they'd need a special set-top or converter box, up from 60% two years ago. Sixty percent believe that HDTV signals are widely available, up from 48%.\n\nTo peruse the full release with charts, go to: http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2458\n\nLarge Screen, Enhanced Storage Capacity and Wired or Wireless Connectivity Display Digital Memories Anywhere in Your Home or Office\n\nWallflower Systems, Inc. today announced availability of the Wallflower 2 Networked Digital Picture Frame.

Finally, customers will watch what they want, when they want � from avirtually unlimited and interactive content selection,\" said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC Communications Inc. chairman and CEO. \"We will deliver integrated communications and entertainment services to enhance the digital lifestyle of our customers.\"\n\nSBC Labs has been testing an IP-based television service built on the Microsoft TV IPTV Edition platform since June 2004. SBC companies and Microsoft will begin field trials in mid 2005 and plan commercial availability of the IP-based television platform in late 2005.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2005, construction is expected to begin on the SBC Project Lightspeed, the company's initiative to deploy fiber closer to customer locations to provide new, feature-rich, IP-based services, including IP television, voice over IP (VoIP), and ultra-fast Internet access. Project Lightspeed is expected to reach 18 million households by year end 2007.\n\n\"Project Lightspeed and the Microsoft and SBC relationship underscore what the future holds for consumers: a virtually unlimited opportunity for innovative, cross-device services and entertainment experiences enabled by the marriage of powerful broadband networks with the magic of software,\" said Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft. \"The selection of Microsoft TV as the IPTV services platform provider for SBC recognizes Microsoft's leadership position in the rapidly emerging IPTV industry and the benefits it will bring to customers.\"\n\nMicrosoft TV IPTV Edition also provides strong security features and efficiency in delivering standard and high-definition TV programming to multiple TV sets in the home over the SBC fiber-enhanced network, while leaving ample bandwidth available for ultra-fast Internet access and VoIP services.\n\nIPTV Potential Offerings\n\nThe new service will enable a next-generation digital video entertainment experience not previously realized in the mass market. The solution will take full advantage of the SBC expanding two-way broadband network to offer new, innovative services beyond today's existing broadcast-oriented digital TV networks.\n\nAdditionally, by using IP technology to deliver video, voice, data and other advanced services and applications over a single network connection, the services may be accessed and shared via any number of IP-enabled household devices, such as TVs, set-top boxes, PCs, PDAs or phones. Microsoft TV IPTV Edition also provides a comprehensive security system including subscriber and end-to-end digital rights management technology to protect the content across multiple devices.\n\nThe IP-based TV service is planned to include instant channel changing, customizable channel lineups, video on demand, digital video recording, multimedia interactive program guides, event notifications, content protection features and more.\n\n\"We will have a rich multimedia program guide that makes it easy to find the programs you want to watch, and provides full control over when and how you want to watch them,\" said Whitacre. \"Channel surfing becomes easier because you can continue to watch your program while viewing live previews of other shows using innovative picture-in-picture (PIP) technology.\"\n\nSome additional potential applications include:\n\nUsing two-way broadband networks, SBC companies could be able to send alerts and notifications to customers watching TV in new ways. Some examples include the ability to alert a customer of upcoming favorite shows, or Caller ID and instant messaging right on their TV screen.\n\nThe Microsoft TV IPTV Edition platform could enable new services and applications such as tuner-less picture-in-picture functionality. The PIP feature enables users to preview other shows and channels while the primary channel runs in the background.\n\nPhotos could be easily shared from a networked computer and played back through the TV.\n\nTo enable optimal use of bandwidth, SBC companies plan to use a switched video distribution system, which streams only the content the customer requests instead of broadcasting all channels to everybody at once.

These sets feature encryption technology that provides digital content protection and integrated digital tuners, taking advantage of the industry-standard digital television reception technology that will be included in virtually all TVs in the United States over the next three years in compliance with FCC regulations.\n\n\"LG is committed to working with pay-per-view providers and industry leaders to build compatible technologies to meet the HDTV needs of the hospitality industry,\" said Ron Snaidauf, vice president of commercial products, LG Electronics USA, Inc. \"These new models are the first in the industry to allow hoteliers the ability to provide high-value HDTV programming without the worries of piracy or descrambling issues.\"\n\nDIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT CRUCIAL TO HOTELS Senior Vice President Richard Lewis called digital rights management \"the key to hoteliers getting access to fresh new digital content.\"\n\n\"Working closely with PPV and content providers, we have developed an end- to-end encryption system that breaks new ground in providing a secure means to deliver high-value digital content directly to hotel rooms,\" Lewis said.\n\nHigh-definition pay-per-view movies and other high-value programs add a new dimension to the lodging industry's deployment of flat-panel displays, Lewis said, adding that movie studios have been reluctant to release this type of content due to piracy concerns. \"Now we have an encryption system that is both compatible with existing PPV interface controllers and meets the needs of movie studios and satellite providers,\" he said.\n\nSnaidauf explained that LG's new integrated PDP, LCD and CRT HDTVs, all with encryption technology and LG's PPV-compatible multiple-protocol interface (MPI), are designed to receive digital HDTV programming without the need for outboard tuners. The new integrated HDTVs are all equipped with LG's proprietary XD Engine(TM) technology, which takes low-resolution analog signals to near high-definition levels, providing better overall picture quality and an enhanced viewing experience.\n\nFCC REGULATIONS WILL TRANSFORM IN-ROOM VIEWING\n\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations requiring virtually all TVs to include digital television (DTV) tuners by 2007 applies not only to consumer sets, but also to TVs installed in hotel rooms. Those DTV tuners, which receive HDTV broadcasts, are being phased-in now with 36-inch and larger TVs.\n\n\"That means the HDTV experience already in more than 12 million U.S. living rooms will soon become an enhanced guest experience in our 'home away from home,' the millions of hotel rooms across the nation,\" explained Snaidauf.\n\nJust as consumers today are experiencing the benefits of digital TV, including its widescreen, high-definition images, hoteliers will be able to offer compelling HDTV content thanks to LG Electronics technology such as the industry's first in-room HDTV system.\n\nWith the new FCC DTV regulations taking effect, LG also is developing integrated hotel HDTVs, Snaidauf said, adding: \"Now is the time for major chains to plan for the future, joining forces with a total in-room video solution supplier like LG, with leadership both in HDTV and in lodging TVs.\"\n\nNEC Makes It Easy and Affordable to Enjoy Vivid, Adaptable and Reliable Large Screen Technology at Home With Friends and Family\n\nAre you tired of going all the way to the movie theater when you want to enjoy an exciting, jaw-dropping entertainment experience?

The Canton CD 300 series combines technology derived from the company's high-end Karat line of loudspeakers with the sleek, brushed aluminum lifestyle design of its popular CD 100 series.\n\nThe current line consists of the CD 300 floor-standing tower speaker and the CD 360F, which includes the same driver configuration adapted for vertical or horizontal wall mounting. With their elegant design and silvery grills, these speakers create a dramatic presence while delivering sound quality that will please the most demanding audiophiles.\n\nBoth the CD 300 and the CD 360 F are sophisticated two-and-a-half way systems with four 4-inch aluminum cone drivers and an advanced version of the Canton's lauded ADT-25 one-inch aluminum-manganese tweeter. Two of the 4-inch drivers reproduce low-frequency bass signals exclusively, while the other two reproduce both bass and midrange sounds. For bass reproduction, this arrangement provides the equivalent surface area of an 8-inch woofer in a much narrower cabinet.\n\nThe remarkable Canton ADT-25 tweeter uses a one-piece aluminum-manganese dome and voice coil former that is vastly superior to more conventional designs where a separate dome and former are glued together. Not only is this entire structure much lighter and stiffer than two-part designs, but the dome provides a large surface area to radiate heat away from the voice coil. One of the key design elements of this tweeter is the use of a very narrow voice coil gap to increase the intensity of the magnetic field. Most other tweeters have relatively wide gaps to allow a margin of error for centering the coil in the gap, but even then a small displacement can harm the performance of the tweeter. Canton has overcome this by making it possible for quality control technicians to adjust the centering of the coils using test signals and to lock them in place only when the test is perfect. Additionally, the cross-section of the coil and former is much thinner than conventional designs. These factors provide for much higher output levels, high linearity, and excellent efficiency.\n\nThe four identical 4-inch bass/midrange drivers have aluminum cones with concave dust caps and powerful motor systems. The drivers are derivatives of the same top-quality midrange drivers used in Canton�s high-end Karat and Ergo speaker lines, and the wave system (cone, dust cap, and surround) is modeled on that used in the Karat Reference line. The motor structure has been subtly redesigned to accommodate the wider frequency demands of the bass/midrange application in the CD 300 and 360F.\n\nUpon encountering the Canton CD 300 tower speaker, the first thing that is apparent is the speaker's unusual appearance. The 48-inch tall enclosure is less than 5 inches wide, has a depth of just over 6-inches, and is constructed of extruded aluminum with rugged pressure-cast aluminum end-caps and circular base. Bass performance is further enhanced by the use of bass-reflex topology with a single front-panel port. The careful and precise modeling of the flare on this port alone yielded a 6-dB improvement in system headroom.\n\nThe Canton CD 360F features the same basic design considerations and driver complement as the CD 300, but in a sealed cabinet that is just 23-1/2-inches long and a mere 4-inches deep. This makes it ideal for wall mounting and equally effective as a vertical speaker beside a wall-mounted video screen, or in a horizontal configuration for use as a center channel speaker. The speaker employs a sealed cabinet design to avoid having the port vent directly into the wall face. The CD 300 and CD 360F are a perfect tonal match for each other, so they can be mixed and matched within a system.\n\nThese loudspeakers are now available for suggested retail prices of $2,000 per pair for the Canton CD 300 and $800 each for the Canton CD 360F.\n\nCanton is the largest manufacturer and best-selling brand of loudspeakers in Germany. It was founded in 1973 by a group of audio enthusiasts who defined their mission \"to always develop the finest loudspeakers in their class.\" For more information about this and other fine Canton products, visit http://www.cantonusa.com or call 612-706-9250.\n\nAtlantic Technology today announced the introduction of the System 920 home theater speaker system that establishes a new performance benchmark for compact subwoofer-satellite designs while demonstrating its obvious sonic lineage to the company's acclaimed high-end systems. The system employs five identical two-way mini-satellites and a compact long-throw sealed subwoofer to deliver engaging multichannel sound without monopolizing either living space or the customer�s budget. A 5.1-channel system in attractive black satin finish has a retail price of just $899.\n\nThe System 920 satellite speakers are true two-way systems, each featuring a 4-inch GLH (Graphite Loaded Homopolymer) cone woofer that delivers clean and linear bass response down to 100 Hz�the critical frequency for proper blending with the subwoofer. The high end reproduction is handled by a 1-inch soft dome tweeter with a powerful neodymium magnet. The drivers are mounted in an acoustically inert, sealed MDF enclosure, and are magnetically shielded to prevent interference with video equipment.\n\nFor deep bass reproduction, the System 920 features the new model 102 SB subwoofer. This sealed-box design employs a down-firing 8-inch bass driver powered by a conservatively-rated 100 Watt class AB amplifier. Unlike most similarly-priced and -sized subwoofers which use light-duty woofers with small motor assemblies, the 102 SB driver uses a massive vented magnet structure and an oversized high-temperature voice coil to make the most effective use of power possible. Atlantic's exclusive Clear Filter Technology � assures clean, powerful, articulate bass reproduction regardless of playback level.\n\nAtlantic Technology's System 920 is designed for maximum placement and mounting flexibility in any environment. The attractive satellites and compact subwoofer are available in either black satin or optional silver metallic finish. The satellites are just slightly taller than 8-inches, and under 6-inches wide and deep, and can be mounted on bookshelves, stands, or directly to the wall using the rear-panel keyhole bracket or threaded insert. The satellites feature the company's signature detachable magnetic metal grill, originally developed for the company's $20,000 flagship System 8200.\n\nThe System 920 will be available in early December at a suggested retail of $899 for a complete Satin Black 5.1 subwoofer/satellite system. The 102 SB subwoofer will also be available separately at a suggested retail price of $375.\n\nFrom its inception in 1989, Atlantic Technology's mission has been to produce home entertainment products that exemplify the very best in both performance and value. The company specializes in complete high-performance multi-channel speaker systems, state-of-the-art home theater electronics components, and products for custom audio/video installation.

This article should be required reading for anyone who is thinking about buying an LCD TV or LCD computer monitor. Get the skinny on flat-panel LCD displays, and the truth about everything from how long they last to the real deal on burn-in.\n\nMisconception #1: Liquid crystal diode (LCD) displays actually contain liquid.\n\nThis is an understandable misinterpretation of the term \"liquid\" as it is being used here. In this case, the term refers to a peculiar quality of a certain type of crystal, not its physical appearance.\n\nThe twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal is the most common type of liquid crystal being used in display applications today (e.g., LCD televisions, LCD monitors, and LCD projectors). It has a naturally twisted crystalline structure. A particular feature of this crystal is that it reacts to electric currents in predictable ways -- i.e., by untwisting to varying degrees depending on the voltage of the current to which it is exposed. Hence the \"liquid\" part of the crystal�s moniker: Rather than being an oxymoron (How can a solid also be a liquid?), the term refers to the relative pliability of the crystals themselves, which is to say, their twistability.\n\nMisconception #2: LCDs last forever.\n\nThey say nothing lasts forever -- and neither do LCD televisions. The average lifespan of an LCD display is 60,000 hours. If watching TV was your full-time job, and you did it 24 hours a day, it would take you almost 7 years to wear out your LCD display. With more normal viewing habits of, say, 8 hours per day, you can extend the lifespan of your TV by a decade or more (to about 20 years)!\n\nA more immediate concern is the actual lifespan of the light source in your LCD. This is perhaps THE critical component of your display unit. It is particularly important for maintaining a proper white balance on your TV. As these florescent bulbs age, colors can become unbalanced, which could result in too much red, for example, in your picture. So, it pays to buy name-brand displays. You will definitely pay more for better LCD display brands like Sharp, Toshiba, JVC, or Sony than you will for cheap Chinese or Korean variety knock-offs, but you�ll get a backlighting bulb of higher quality and, in the end, a TV whose colors will stay truer longer.\n\nNOTE: As far as I know, Sharp flat-panel LCD TVs are the only ones on the market whose backlights can be replaced by consumers themselves, though qualified technicians mnay be able to replace burnt-out florescent bulbs in other LCD flat panel TVs.\n\nMisconception #3: LCD TVs suffer from burn-in.\n\nAbsolutely untrue. LCD monitors work by blocking light, so it is literally impossible for burn-in to occur on the screen. LCD TVs are sometimes referred to as \"transmissive\" displays, meaning that light isn't created by the liquid crystals themselves. Instead, a light source (bulb) behind the panel shines light through the display, which uses liquid crystals to manipulate the intensity of that light. When light is generated from a source external to the display screen itself, images cannot be permanently -- or even temporarily -- retained.\n\nMisconception #4: You can't watch an LCD TV from the side.\n\nThis is a source of constant carping for LCD aficionados -- limited viewing angles. It is sometimes the case that LCD displays have impaired side-viewing angles. Of course, most manufacturers will tell you just the opposite, that LCD TVs have viewing angles to rival comparably-sized plasma displays (i.e., 160� or more). But this is simply not the case. While it is sometimes possible to view LCD televisions 80� off axis, the picture you'll see will be degraded. In other words, there will be a noticeable decrease in color saturation, contrast, and brightness in the picture.\n\nQuality really makes a difference in terms of viewing angle: If you buy an LCD display from one of the better manufacturers (e.g., Sharp or Sony), you should be able to sit about 70� off axis and still see a perfectly displayed imaged. Dot pitch is an important factor here. Higher dot pitches increase the viewing angles of LCD panels. Since dot pitch is measure in millimeters (mm), a good rule of thumb is this: Smaller dot pitches make for sharper images. You generally want a dot pitch of .28mm (�10,000 pixels/in2 of your display) or finer.\n\nMisconception #5: LCD TV is replacing plasma TV.\n\nSome say that LCD is replacing plasma as the premier flat-panel display technology. Not so. While LCD may seem like the obvious technology for digital signage applications, given its relative durability and imperviousness to burn-in, LCD monitors have not exactly outpaced their plasma counterparts in the commercial arena. Nor has LCD technology beaten-out plasma as the best-selling home-theater appliances in America. In May 2004, plasma displays accounted for 47% of all 30\" to 39\" monitors sold in the U.S. The remaining 53% of the market share went to LCD TVs. LCD TVs certainly have the edge in the under-40\" display category -- then again, this is the market segment LCDs are supposed to dominate. When you look at the 40\" to 49\" screen-size market, the one where flat-panel display account for a full 43% of total sales, plasma technology reigns supreme, particularly in the very hot 40\" to 42\" segment.\n\nA major reason for plasma's continued dominance in the over-30\" display market is cost: 40\" LCDs, for example, cost on average $1800 more than 42\" plasmas. So, in the price-to-size comparison, plasma TVs continue to beat out LCD TVs hands down.\n\nSo, anyone who says that LCD technology has displaced plasma technology is sorely mistaken. While LCD displays have become increasingly visible in the fixed-pixel display market, plasma is still king in the over-40\" display category.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.plasmatvbuyingguide.com\n\nQuixel Research, a top Home Theater consumer-focused research firm, recently conducted a first of its kind consumer survey in Best Buys across the U.S. This study surveyed purchase-intending consumers in the retail environment and found out US consumer preferences when Advanced Display technologies were compared side-by-side!\n\nPortland, OR (PRWEB) November 11, 2004 -� Quixel Research LLC, a market intelligence company focused on the Home Theater and Home Entertainment TV markets, recently published a new study, �Advanced TV Comparison 2004: Comparing Plasma, LCDTV, MicroDisplay RPTV and Front Projection at Best Buy Stores.�\n\nThis in-depth, consumer-focused study found that Plasma and LCDTVs were the most preferred technologies, but the majority of consumers were\n\nwilling trade thin for a larger screen size. This study is the first of its kind to compare all the products side by side in a retail environment across the USA.\n\nGreat news for all large display manufacturers: Consumers have the space, opportunity and significant budget to purchase one of the advanced TVs.\n\n� 77% of consumers surveyed would like to have a screen size larger than 40 inches\n\n� Male respondents had higher stated budgets than female respondents; 56% of respondents had substantial budgets for their TV purchase\n\nConsumers showed high awareness levels for most all of the advanced TV technologies surveyed.\n\nSeveral of the findings by product category include:\n\n� Plasma Consumers rated Plasma as the most popular TV technology but prices were still above their stated price expectations. When comparing Plasma and MD RPTV directly, 56 percent of respondents stated that they would trade a 42� ED Plasma TV for a 50� HD MD RPTV if the price was $2,000 for either TV. Thin design was one of the benefits for Plasma but it could be traded for screen size.\n\n� LCD TV LCDTV was not quite as popular as Plasma TV. Consumers preferred the picture quality and space saving quality for LCDTV but price was a barrier.\n\n� Front Projectors Consumers believe Front Projectors are not an alternative for TV watching but offer the most similar �cinema like� viewing experience. Screen size is an advantage but the further defined obstacles revolving around the home fit were a disadvantage.\n\n� Microdisplay RPTV Screen size and picture quality were the top advantages for MD RPTVs. Several of the stated disadvantages highlighted that consumers are not yet fully aware of the latest progress made by this category.\n\nFull Overview of Study available to Media by request.\n\nContact Info:\n\nVictoria Pederson\n\n971-246-0411\n\nQuixel Research, LLC\n\nIRVINE, California, November 11, 2004 - Samsung, the world�s leading manufacturer of computer monitors, once again showcases its technology prowess with the introduction of the new SyncMaster 711t LCD monitor. The SyncMaster 711t features an impressive 1000:1 contrast ratio -- one of the highest of any 17-inch LCDs in the marketplace today -- that is ideal for providing detailed onscreen images. Samsung�s SyncMaster 711t is currently shipping.\n\nContrast ratio is the measurement of the difference in light intensity between the brightest white and the blackest black. While most 17-inch LCDs today offer 600:1 contrast ratios, the SyncMaster 711t provides a super-high 1000:1 contrast ratio. As a result, the 711t offers greater legibility when reading or viewing content on the monitor�s screen. Additionally, a higher contrast ratio reduces eye fatigue and offers several major benefits to business and home users alike including deeper shadows that are easier to distinguish, colors that are brighter and more enhanced, and text that is sharper and easier to view than with monitors with lower contrast ratios.\n\n�Samsung has consistently been a provider of unique, high-end display solutions and the new SyncMaster 711t is the next progression in our ongoing mission of offering business and home users high-quality, best-of-breed technology at affordable price points,� comments Monica Islas, Product Marketing Manager for Monitors, for Samsung�s Information Technology Division (ITD). �With the SyncMaster 711t�s super-high 1000:1 contrast ratio, Samsung is once again raising the display technology bar and giving consumers advanced solutions that provide the best images available today.�\n\nSamsung�s high-end 711t features the company�s proprietary Patterned Vertical Alignment (PVA), the latest technology advancement in liquid crystal cell structure for improved viewing. The display offers an extra-wide 178� viewing angle, the widest viewing angles of any 17-inch display on the market today. The 711t also offers an ultra-high a 1000:1 contrast ratio, a brightness rate of 250cd/m2, a fine pixel pitch of .264mm and offers a maximum resolution of 1280 x 1024.\n\nOffered in sleek black, the SyncMaster 711t sports a very narrow bezel that is just 0.5-inches thick and a removable base, making this monitor ideal for tiling or wall mounting. The 711t also features Pivot� software by Portrait Displays for switching between portrait and landscape viewing. With Pivot, users have full-page viewing capabilities of 8-1/2 x 11 or A4 documents without having to scroll.\n\nThe SyncMaster 711t utilizes Samsung�s proprietary MagicTune� software and MagicBright� technology. MagicTune, a true launching pad for future technology, enables users to have full control over all display features with extensive color adjustment capability per an individual�s personal viewing criteria. This produces the best front of screen performance for the optimal personalized viewing experience. MagicTune allows users the ability to save the various personalized display profiles for whatever environment or mode the user is in. MagicTune gives users the ability to adjust the monitor�s various settings with a simple click of a mouse -- all of this functionality is completed with no additional cable or interface -- MagicTune communication is completed through the video cable. This is a more user-friendly and accurate method to adjust the display�s settings to each users own personalized preference and working environment.\n\nSamsung has also incorporated its MagicBright technology into the new SyncMaster 711t. MagicBright allows users to change the brightness of the display to adjust to various applications with the simple push of one button. MagicBright offers settings for text computing, viewing video on the Internet and for entertainment applications such as gaming, video streaming or even viewing DVD�s on your display through your computer.\n\nRecent monitor market research data shows that approximately 30% of all LCDs sold incorporate a digital interface. Samsung is leading this trend by offering its consumers both analog and digital inputs in the SyncMaster 711t. The natural state of a computer processor/video card and an LCD monitor is digital. The video card converts the digital data signal to an analog signal then the analog signal travels through the video cable and interfaces to the LCD. The LCD converts the analog signal to a digital signal in order to display the image. Because of these various technical conversions that take place, the image may be subject to data loss and may not portray a clean, clear and crisp image. With a digital input LCD monitor, the signal does not face this complex conversion process and provides the cleanest, most crisp image possible.\n\nSamsung backs all of its monitors with a three-year parts and labor warranty as well as toll-free technical support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In addition, Samsung offers a three-year Advanced Replacement Program, three-year Repair & Return or Exchange and three-year Shuttle Exchange for hassle-free repairs.\n\nFor more information about Samsung's SyncMaster monitors or for the name of the dealer nearest you, contact Samsung toll-free at 1-800-SAMSUNG or via the Internet at www.samsungusa.com/monitor.\n\nAbout Samsung�s Information Technology Division\n\nSamsung Electronics America�s Information Technology Division (ITD), located in Irvine, California, is the U.S. subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.

(TSX: ATY, NASDAQ: ATYT) announced today that the vast majority of commercially available integrated Digital Cable Ready (DCR) High Definition Televisions use ATI�s NXT2003�. The NXT2003 is the industry�s first single chip off-air DTV and unidirectional cable receiver. DCR HDTV sets are rigorously tested to insure quality operation. Eleven consumer electronic companies have announced digital cable certified HDTV sets. Of these, nine rely on ATI�s NXT series components for reliable high performance reception: Panasonic, Samsung, Toshiba, Hitachi, Sony, Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America, Inc., Thomson, Inc., Sharp, and another major manufacturer yet to be announced.\n\nDigital televisions that have the �Digital Cable Ready� (DCR) label conform to the United States� Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations that guarantee the TV will be able to receive digital programming from the majority of cable providers within the United States. A DCR television can be plugged directly into the cable system and receive analog and most digital services without the need for a separate set-top box. A CableCard, supplied by the local cable company, is plugged into the television to enable digital cable service.\n\n�ATI is proud to enable and facilitate the DTV transition,� said Mike Gittings, Director of Marketing, DTV Products, ATI Technologies Inc. �Through vision and innovation, ATI is delivering the quality components that our customers demand. The NXT2003/4/5 product family provide the key technologies that enabled manufacturers to develop HDTV sets that comply with the FCC Tuner mandate and Cable Plug and Play Agreement. They also provide seamless migration for the bidirectional cable specifications and requirements.�\n\nThe NXT2003 is a member of a trio of high performance integrated circuits that were the first to combine digital terrestrial reception and cable compatibility on a single chip. The NXT2004 VSB/QAM Receiver (vestigial side band/quadrature amplitude modulation) is designed for a variety of applications including off-air and digital cable television receivers, set-top boxes, PCDTV and datacast applications where cost, low power and industry leading performance are a must. The NXT2004 VSB/QAM Demodulator is configurable to work in either the ATSC compliant 8 VSB mode for terrestrial broadcasting or in the ITU-J.83B/SCTE DVS-031 compliant 64 QAM or 256 QAM modes. The NXT2003 includes all of the functionality of the NXT2004 and adds a QPSK receiver for receiving the Forward Data Channel, required for unidirectional cable operation. The NXT2005 DTV Cable Transceiver and Terrestrial Receiver is capable of receiving VSB off-air signals and performing the bi-directional cable reception and transmission formats required by the emerging bi-directional cable TV standards.\n\nLeveraging the nation's fascination with home renovation and improvement, consumers will have the chance to win a $50,000 Digital Home Makeover on SonyStyle.com this holiday season.\n\nRunning Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the sweepstakes offers consumers the opportunity to revitalize and enhance their home with a complete line of best-selling Sony entertainment and electronics products, ranging from a 61-inch XBR Plasma WEGA HDTV valued at $20,000, a Network Walkman 20GB Hard Drive Digital Music Player and 7.0 Mega-pixel Cyber-shot Digital Camera, to an all-in-one VAIO desktop PC and the latest AIBO Entertainment Robot.
