Not quite as early or exciting as we expected, but better late than never, and there's no better time than the present to start placeshifting your media to wow your friends and / or mother. Remember, you'll still need a Windows or Linux box running the full-blown SageTV app to actually do the shifting, and that'll cost you $99 and includes one placeshifting license. You can pick up another for $30. As always, we recommend such gifts on February 14th only when accompanied by the traditional flowers / candy / bears standbys -- let's stay safe out there!",
