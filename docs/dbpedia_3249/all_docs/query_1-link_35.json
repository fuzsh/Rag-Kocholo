        "text": "SageTV Media Center Version 5 ($79.95 direct) helps you turn your existing PC into a full-blown media center without having to upgrade your OS. More than just a DVR (digital video recorder), SageTV is a software app that provides an intuitive interface, similar to Microsoft's Windows Media Center Edition (MCE). It makes it easy to schedule and record your favorite TV programs and access your photos, music, and other multimedia files from within a single application. And because SageTV records live TV to your hard drive, you can pause, fast-forward, and rewind programs, and skip through commercials just as you can with TiVo.\n\nUnlike MCE, you can install SageTV on systems running Windows versions from 98 SE on up, including the much-maligned Windows Me. In order to watch and record TV programs, your system (the host) must have at least one supported TV tuner installed (more than 30 cards are supported). Alternately, you can order one of SageTV's Media Center In-a-Box bundles, which offer a choice of single ($144.95) or dual ($209.95) PCI tuner cards to install in your system. If you want to watch one channel while recording another or schedule two separate recording at the same time, you'll need a dual-tuner configuration.\n\nSetup and installation are straightforward, thanks to a series of wizards that automatically configure the software after detecting your hardware and existing media files. During setup, you'll be asked to choose your cable or satellite TV service provider so SageTV can download your Integrated Programming Guide. This lets you view two weeks of TV listings and allows you to schedule recordings by clicking on a particular listing.\n\nThe menu system is pretty self-explanatory. The SageTV Recordings screen shows you a list of all TV recordings stored on your system, including information such as date, time, and channel. Recordings are listed alphabetically, by category, or by the original airdate.\n\nThe Watch Live TV screen displays the current TV channel you're tuned to. Upon entering Live TV, a description of the show, including the title, plot, and host or star, is displayed for several seconds, along with a set of player controls and a recording-time status bar, all of which can be invoked by clicking the left mouse button. Right-clicking the mouse brings up a menu where you can toggle to full-screen mode, change the aspect ratio, stop and start playback, enter the program guide, or return to the main menu.\n\nRecordings can be scheduled via the Program Guide or by using the Schedule Recordings option, which provides several ways of managing your recordings. You can search for programs by title, person, or category. For example, when I searched for \"Martin Scorsese\" I turned up listings for Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and Cape Fear. It also brought up Shark Tale, in which Scorsese had a voice part. The Favorites Manager utility lets you create a list of shows to be recorded by title, actor, or category, and you can specify first-run showings and/or reruns. You can opt to keep things simple and create timed recordings by selecting a channel, recording date, and start/stop times.\n\nIn addition to its TV capabilities, SageTV contains a music player, a DVD player, and a photo viewer, all of which are controlled through the Media Center menu page. The music Playlist Manager lets you choose and create playlists from your collection of tunes, and you can perform a search by album, artist, or song title. There is currently no support for AAC files, but the folks at SageTV tell me they are working on that for a future revision.\n\nDigital photos can be viewed individually or in a slide show and can be sorted by date or file name. The DVD application provides the usual complement of player controls, including fast forward and chapter skip, subtitles, and subtitle language selection. The Video Library contains listings of all video files stored on your hard drive, and the player supports most video formats, including MPEG, AVI, DivX, and TiVo files.\n\nNew to this version of SageTV is support for place shifting, a concept made popular by Sling Media's Slingbox. With the optional SageTV Placeshifter ($29.95 per license) you can access and control the SageTV application and all of the digital media stored on your host system from a remote PC via the Internet. That means you can watch live TV on your laptop without the need for an additional tuner card, watch recorded programs or video files stored on the host system, and schedule TV recordings, all from a remote location. Unfortunately, you cannot access the host's DVD player, so sharing DVD movies is not possible. Each remote Placeshifter system requires a separate license and uses a unique Locator ID to connect to the host. Of course, you'll also have to leave both the host system and SageTV up and running.\n\nWhen I was testing place shifting over my local network, the remote picture was not as crisp as I would have liked, and the video was choppy from time to time. Still, the overall viewing experience was good, and once I got used to the background artifacts, I hardly noticed them. Music files loaded quickly and played smoothly, but large JPEG images took a few seconds to load.\n\nConversely, while attached to a SageTV demo server located in Monterey, California, live TV was significantly fuzzier and choppier than on my local tests, and it took up to 10 seconds to load certain photo images. But music playback was, again, just fine.\n\nYou can enjoy the benefits of SageTV in your living room without a PC by using the optional SageTV Media Extender ($109.95). The Media Extender, which is actually a Hauppauge Computer Works MediaMVP box, requires an Ethernet connection to bring recorded programs, pictures, music, and the SageTV interface to your TV. As of this writing, however, it must use a wired connection (a wireless 802.11 version is due out shortly). The extender comes with a set of A/V cables for stereo audio and composite video connections, a Hauppauge remote control, and a 5-foot Ethernet cable. There is an S-Video out connector, but you'll have to supply your own cable.\n\nThe Media Extender worked flawlessly for me, but as with the Placeshifter, you cannot play DVDs from the host machine. However, live TV and recorded programs looked great on my living room TV, and the sound and video synced up nicely. By plugging in the audio cables to my A/V receiver I could access playlists and play music stored on the PC through my main entertainment center sound system.\n\nSageTV V5.0 is a good alternative to Microsoft MCE as a media center front end, and it is flexible enough to work on nearly every version of Windows. Although the image quality running on a remote place-shifter system is dependent on your available bandwidth, you should have no problem running it on a local network."
