        "text": "The Reach for Reading instructional materials for grades K-6 partially meet the expectations of alignment. The materials K-1-2 are targeted to support foundational reading development. Across grades K through 6, texts included are of quality, although their qualitative measures and their organization over the course of the school years partially support supporting students’ reading development to independence. The materials include many informational texts. The materials do include robust opportunities for reading about topics, although the associated series of questions and tasks inconsistently support knowledge building of topics across the grades.\n\nThe Reach for Reading instructional materials for grades K-6 partially meet the expectations of alignment.
