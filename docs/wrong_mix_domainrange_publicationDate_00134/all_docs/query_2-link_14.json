        "text": "After outlining the opportunities offered by closely bringing together queer theory and translation studies for an engaged application of trans- or postdisciplinary research, as presented in Brian James Baer’s Queer Theory and Translation Studies (2020), the article briefly discusses the structural reasons why queer theory has not been much applied to the study of Slovak translated or non-translated literature before the publication of Eva Spišiaková’s Queering Translation History. Shakespeare’s Sonnets in Czech and Slovak Transformations (2021). Subsequently, it provides a critical reading of Spišiaková’s volume. The concluding remarks argue that a greater degree of cooperation between agents situated in various locales is necessary.\n\nIs the concept of queer translation yet another recent, unexciting addition to the theoretical toolbox of queer theory and translation studies? Or does it actually make a difference and offer an opportunity for both queer theory and translation studies to reevaluate their critical practices? Employing Gilles Deleuze’s form of immanent critique, this article reconstructs a new concept of queer translation, redefined here as the minor art of desexualizing language in a repetition of difference. Understood as essentially pragmatic, problematic, and genetic, the Deleuzian critique of queer translation begins by scrutinizing two current conceptions of queer translation and their attempts at establishing the difference they make. I trace their critical impasses back to the type of thinking (or “image of thought”) that had engendered them: one that is based on a “weak” concept of difference in queer theory, and the other—on a “weak” concept of repetition in translation studies. In order to create a new concept of queer translation, I then turn to Deleuze’s concept of writing as pivot on which the theoretical concept becomes pertinent from a practical standpoint. This move not only renders the concept more coherent and effective, but also enable us, I argue, to discern existing practices of queer translation at play even in original works of literature. In the final section of the article, this argument is thus demonstrated in a discussion of French author Marie Darrieussecq’s literary technique in the novel Truismes (Pig Tales).\n\nThis article attempts to draw a theoretical line between closeted (homo)sexuality and translation through the example of the translational activity of those who collaborated on the 20th-century Argentine literary journal SUR: J. Bianco, E. Pezzoni, V. Ocampo, and H. A. Murena. Through a critical reading of explicit and thinly-veiled discourses on homosexuality in works both written and translated in this period, especially when placed in the context of theoretical discourses on translation, gender and sexuality, it reveals a question all the more unavoidable for present-day discussions: Is translation a closet, and if so, when and how? Le placard du traducteur : l’édition d’identités dans la culture littéraire argentine Cet article vise à tracer une ligne théorique entre l’(homo)sexualité du placard et la traduction à travers l’exemple des activités traductrices de collaborateurs de la revue littéraire argentine du vingtième siècle SUR : J. Bianco, E. Pezzoni, V. Ocampo et H. A. Murena. Par une lecture critique des discours explicites et voilés sur l’homosexualité dans des oeuvres écrites et traduites pendant cette période, surtout dans le contexte des discours théoriques sur la traduction, le genre et la sexualité, une question s’avère encore plus incontournable pour la discussion actuelle : la traduction est-elle un placard, et si oui, quand et comment?"
