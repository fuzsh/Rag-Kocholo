        "text": "tags.\n\nJules Verne was a renowned French author and futurist who pioneered the science fiction genre. Through his extraordinary vision and skillful writing, he opened readers‘ eyes to the wonders of technology and the possibilities of the future.\n\nVerne captured the spirit of an optimistic time when it seemed anything could be achieved through scientific ingenuity. His enduring popularity and influence show that his stories remain as captivating today as when he wrote them in the 19th century.\n\nJules Verne Profile\n\nFull Name Jules Gabriel Verne Birthday February 8, 1828 Age 77 years (1828 – 1905) Birth Sign Aquarius Born Nantes, France Death Date March 24, 1905 Relationship Married to Honorine de Viane Morel Height 5‘4\" (163 cm) Net Worth Estimated up to $2 million at death Social Profiles Website, Facebook, Twitter\n\nEarly Life Develops Wanderlust and Imagination\n\nJules Verne was born in the busy seaport of Nantes, France in 1828. As a child, Verne had a wanderlust fueled by reading adventure stories and watching ships arrive from exotic destinations. He snuck aboard ships to imaginary distant shores beyond the horizon.\n\nVerne moved to Paris in 1847 to study law at his father‘s insistence. But his heart wasn‘t in dusty law books. He found himself drawn to literature and the theater. Verne began writing short comedy plays in his free time.\n\nAfter receiving his law degree in 1851, Verne took a day job as a stockbroker. This gave him financial security to pursue writing. He rose early each morning to work on stories before heading to the stock exchange.\n\nBig Breakthrough Working With Hetzel Publishing\n\nIn 1857, Jules Verne met Pierre-Jules Hetzel, an enterprising publisher who would launch his career. Verne gave Hetzel the manuscript for his debut novel Five Weeks in a Balloon. Hetzel recognized Verne‘s talent for thrilling science-driven adventure and published the book in 1863.\n\nThe novel follows a light-hearted expedition across Africa in a balloon, with narrow escapes from danger at every turn. Five Weeks in a Balloon became a smash hit and bestseller. This marked the beginning of an immensely productive collaboration between Verne and Hetzel‘s publishing house.\n\nFor the rest of his career, Verne contracted to publish two books a year with Hetzel. The deal allowed Verne to become a full-time author and take his writing to new heights of imagination.\n\nClassic Sci-Fi Novels That Inspired Generations\n\nSome of Verne‘s most popular sci-fi titles published with Hetzel include:\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth (1864) – A professor leads an expedition down an Icelandic volcano to explore the unknown depths below.\n\nFrom the Earth to the Moon (1865) – Members of a post-Civil War gun club construct a giant cannon to launch themselves to the moon.\n\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870) – A strange giant sea creature is revealed to be a highly advanced submarine, the Nautilus, helmed by the mysterious Captain Nemo.\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days (1873) – A gentleman named Phileas Fogg attempts to travel across the globe in under 80 days on a bet.\n\nThese stories fused rip-roaring adventure with pioneering science fiction concepts. Verne reveled in conjuring up futuristic submarines, spacecraft, and other innovations decades before they became reality. He awed readers with his technological prophecies.\n\nLasting Popularity and Acclaim\n\nDuring his lifetime, Jules Verne achieved great fame and success. By his death in 1905, his books were translated into numerous languages and devoured by readers internationally.\n\nBut more than just a popular author, Verne inspired generations of writers. Sci-fi pioneers including H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, and Arthur C. Clarke all owed a debt to Verne for paving the way for their own futuristic works.\n\nBeyond fiction, Verne motivated real-world scientific advancement. Engineers were spurred by Verne‘s vivid descriptions of submarines and rockets to make them a reality. He demonstrated science fiction‘s power to captivate while spreading knowledge and optimism about human progress.\n\nLater Years: Politics and Playwriting\n\nIn his later years, Jules Verne settled down in the provincial town of Amiens with his wife Honorine. He entered politics, serving on Amiens‘ city council. Verne also continued writing theatre.\n\nHis science fiction output slowed, but he published the darker dystopian novel Paris in the Twentieth Century in 1994, along with the adventure tale The Lighthouse at the End of the World (1905).\n\nOn March 24, 1905, Jules Verne died aged 77, leaving behind an unparalleled literary legacy. His pioneering works had laid the foundations of modern science fiction and inspired future generations to imagine, dream, and create.\n\n10 Fascinating Facts About Jules Verne\n\nVerne woke up at 4 AM each day to work on stories before his 9-5 job as a stockbroker.\n\nHe served on city council in Amiens, France from 1888-1903.\n\nVerne‘s tomb in Amiens is decorated with a sculpture of him emerging from a tombstone.\n\nHis first published story was the comic opera The Broken Straws in 1850.\n\nVerne believed his English translations took too many liberties. Two \"translations\" were rewritten by the publisher.\n\nHe accurately predicted electric submarines, skywriting, and other future technologies.\n\nVerne‘s writing was influenced by scientist Jean Macé who encouraged science in fiction.\n\nAround the World in 80 Days made globetrotting a popular leisure activity.\n\nA giant squid that attacked his antihero Nemo inspired 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\n\nOver 200 films have adapted Verne‘s works, more than any other author.\n\nWhy Jules Verne Remains Relevant Today\n\nToday, Jules Verne remains one of sci-fi‘s most revered and influential authors.
