        "text": "Solution\n\nVerified by Toppr\n\nHere, option A tries to place an appositive phrase (appositives are nouns, pronouns, or noun phrases that are placed next to nouns to further describe them)- 'pioneer journalist' next to the noun 'exploits' in which case 'Nellie Sly's' possessive is modifying it and making it sound as if the exploits are of a pioneer journalists which is not what the sentence is trying to tell us. '...Including in her exploits...' of option C is extremely wordy and indirect. Subject follows the verb in a grammatically correct sentence and a singular subject requires a singular verb. Since D's singular subject is followed by the plural verb 'are', it is not the correct choice. E is seems to imply that Nellie Sly might not have been a pioneer journalist but a pioneer journalist seems to have exploited Nellie Sly - which is not what the sentence means. B is the only option with a correct appositive construct. Therefore, B seems to fit the context perfectly."
