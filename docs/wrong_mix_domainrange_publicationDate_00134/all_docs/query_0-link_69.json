        "text": "Extraordinary Visions: Stories Inspired by Jules Verne\n\nby The North American Jules Verne Society\n\n6x9\n\n224 pages\n\nISBN 9781629339542\n\nBEFORE SCIENCE FICTION, THERE WAS JULES VERNE\n\nIn the late 19 Century, during a span of 42 years, Jules Verne wrote over 50 novels in the Voyages Extraordinaires collection. His style and subject matter shaped Science Fiction into the genre we now know. Verne led the way, and his amazing tales still delight us today.\n\nThe North American Jules Verne Society is pleased to present its first-ever anthology of short stories, written by a select group of modern authors, inspired by classics like Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days, as well as Verne’s many other works.\n\nWhat secrets await a salvage team raising the Nautilus, and who else wants that submarine?\n\nWhat really happened when Nellie Bly met Jules Verne during her 1889 trip around the world?\n\nOn the front lines of World War I, did a steam-powered mechanical elephant join the fray?\n\nThe Baltimore Gun Club wouldn’t try to alter Earth’s rotational speed—would they?\n\nWhat if your son recreated a thrilling chapter of 20,000 Leagues in your house?\n\nWhat is so odd, very odd, about a particular shop full of Vernian antiques?\n\nMysterious beings dwell at the center of the Earth, but might they take revenge on the surface?\n\nVerne’s spirit and imagination remain vibrant and relevant today. His voyages continue in Extraordinary Visions."
