They hesitate to help, each thinking it is not their problem. A woman in blue takes charge of the situation, instructing each person on how to assist. She has Rebecca get water, Patrick check the man's pulse, and David call an ambulance. After the man is given medicine from his bottle, he feels better. The ambulance then takes him away. The three bystanders are relieved they helped the man, feeling it was the right thing to do, though they do not acknowledge the woman's role in directing their assistance.\n\nA beginner’s guide to project reviews - everything you wanted to know but wer...\n\nA beginner’s guide to project reviews - everything you wanted to know but wer...Association for Project Management\n\nAPM event held on 9 July in Bristol. Speaker: Roy Millard The SWWE Regional Network were very pleased to welcome back to Bristol Roy Millard, of APM’s Assurance Interest Group on 9 July 2024, to talk about project reviews and hopefully answer all your questions. Roy outlined his extensive career and his experience in setting up the APM’s Assurance Specific Interest Group, as they were known then. Using Mentimeter, he asked a number of questions of the audience about their experience of project reviews and what they wanted to know. Roy discussed what a project review was and examined a number of definitions, including APM’s Bok: “Project reviews take place throughout the project life cycle to check the likely or actual achievement of the objectives specified in the project management plan” Why do we do project reviews? Different stakeholders will have different views about this, but usually it is about providing confidence that the project will deliver the expected outputs and benefits, that it is under control. There are many types of project reviews, including peer reviews, internal audit, National Audit Office, IPA, etc. Roy discussed the principles behind the Three Lines of Defence Model:, First line looks at management controls, policies, procedures, Second line at compliance, such as Gate reviews, QA, to check that controls are being followed, and third Line is independent external reviews for the organisations Board, such as Internal Audit or NAO audit. Factors which affect project reviews include the scope, level of independence, customer of the review, team composition and time. Project Audits are a special type of project review. They are generally more independent, formal with clear processes and audit trails, with a greater emphasis on compliance. Project reviews are generally more flexible and informal, but should be evidence based and have some level of independence. Roy looked at 2 examples of where reviews went wrong, London Underground Sub-Surface Upgrade signalling contract, and London’s Garden Bridge. The former had poor 3 lines of defence, no internal audit and weak procurement skills, the latter was a Boris Johnson vanity project with no proper governance due to Johnson’s pressure and interference. Roy discussed the principles of assurance reviews from APM’s Guide to Integrated Assurance (Free to Members), which include: independence, accountability, risk based, and impact, etc Human factors are important in project reviews. The skills and knowledge of the review team, building trust with the project team to avoid defensiveness, body language, and team dynamics, which can only be assessed face to face, active listening, flexibility and objectively.
