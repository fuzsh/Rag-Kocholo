        "text": "BAD NEWS: CRASH has BEGUN. It will be a bad one. 😩 GOOD NEWS: CRASHES are the best time to get rich. Bargains will float to the surface. 🤑 RULES to REMEMBER in a CRASH: 1. DON’T CATCH FALLING KNIVES 🗡️🗡️🗡️ Just because prices are falling DO NOT get GREEDY. Wait til prices have bottomed and no one wants the asset you want. 2. STUDY 🤓📖📙📚 YouTube is a great source for real and fake Teachers. Invest time to get into the heads of the teacher. 3. NEW FRIENDS 🤜🤛 Seek new friends who are on the same path you are on. Stay away from VICTIMS (people who blame others for their problems). Stay away from MARXISTS (people who expect the government to solve their problems) 4. Start a SIDE HUSTLE 😎 OWN your own business. A. I. is going to wipe out millions of jobs. Start a small business and become an Entrepreneur, not an employee afraid of losing their job 5. Choose GREAT TEACHERS 👩🏫👨🏫🧑🏫 YOUTUBE has an abundance of teachers. Some good, many bad. I suggest you choose my teachers. My real real estate teacher is Ken McElroy. Taxes: Tom Wheelwright. Stocks: John MacGregor. Oil: Mike Maucelli. They all have books and their own Podcasts. Be very careful who influences your brain, your attitude, and your spirit. 6. DON’T SAVE MONEY 👎💰 ❌❌❌ Fake money (US dollar, Euro, Yen, Peso) goes down in value. Save gold, silver, Bitcoin, real money that goes up in value, especially in a market crash. TAKE CARE and make this CRASH the best thing that ever happened to you. - Robert Kiyosaki, Author (Rich Dad, Poor Dad)\n\nMITIGATE THE RISKS Google defines 'Risk Mitigation' as, \"the process of reducing the impact of potential risks by developing a plan to manage, eliminate, or limit setbacks\". Life is already full of risks that we cannot possibly always anticipate. That is why we need to have some sort of plan in place to help us to mitigate whatever risks that come our way.

He was obviously outmatched in size and weight. But what he lacked he more than made up for in terms of determination and years of actual experience, competing at the very highest level of the sport. In the same way, even if we have spiritual enemies around us with powerful influence and abilities, we have the assurance of victory over all these opponents. But we still need to learn how to fight by equipping ourselves with the knowledge of spiritual warfare that can only be acquired by reading our Bible daily and getting to know Jesus through prayer and meditating on his promises.\n\nThe terms LOW RISK and GUARANTEED RETURNS usually don't appear together in the same sentence. Yet here we are. 🤔❓❓ ✅ Invest for only 7 years and realize your returns at an 8% interest, GUARANTEED ✅ Receive payouts starting at the end of the 8th year and for the next 12 years after that ✅ On top of the annual payouts, receive a MATURITY BENEFIT at year 20 equivalent to 100% of the sum insured ✅ You also get the highest insurance cover for the entire 20 years equivalent to 250% of the sum insured ✅ As a bonus, get Terminal Illness benefit that pays you 50% of sum insured So is this totally legit?
