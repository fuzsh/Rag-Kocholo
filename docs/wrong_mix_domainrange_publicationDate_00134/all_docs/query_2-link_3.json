        "text": "Are you prepared to handle the spoilers ahead?\n\nThis whole character page contains major spoilers. Continue at your own risk.\n\nJules Gabriel Verne (ジュール・ガブリエル・ヴェルヌ, Jūru Gaburieru Verunu , Jules Gabriel Verne?) is a character featured in the light novel, 55 Minutes. He is one of the inhabitants of Standard Island, as the island itself is the form of his ability.\n\nVerne later died due to his own ability consuming him, and his ability lives on as 'Gab' before being destroyed by Atsushi Nakajima and Ryunosuke Akutagawa.\n\nAppearance\n\nVerne's true appearance is a young and tall man. However, he absorbed the appearance of a person named \"Gab\", a tourist on the Standard island, and used the ability he absorbed long ago to manipulate age and appearance to transform into a young teenager.\n\nPersonality\n\nAbility\n\nMain article: The Mysterious Island\n\nVerne's ability, The Mysterious Island (神秘の島,, Shinpi no Shima?), allows him to absorb the abilities from any ability-user who died on Standard Island; thus he was able to use Wells' Time Machine ability - which then \"Gab\" (his ability living as Verne) utilize for uncountable times, resulting in Standard Island to be trapped in a time loop. This caused the ability (Time Machine) to break its initial capabilities from several minutes into 55 minutes or 3300 seconds.\n\nLater, it was known that Verne died as his ability took over his being; living as \"Gab\".\n\nThe Mysterious Island (神秘の島,, Shinpi no Shima?) Manga Debut: - Anime Debut: - Ability: Ability Absorption\n\nBackground\n\nVerne lost his parents at war. At some point, a certain organization called \"The Seven Traitors\" discovered his skill and took him in.\n\nWhile working for the \"The Seven Traitors\", he defeated numerous special forces and assassins with abilities, only to absorb their abilities and become even stronger.\n\nPlot\n\nJules Verne met H.G. Wells during the latter's search for the ability bomb on the island. He assisted Wells in the search, but Wells was killed, resulting in his ability to absorb Wells' ability.\n\nVerne, who had gained the Time Machine's ability, decided to go back to the past where Wells is still alive, but it all ends the same. This caused Jules to break down, and his ability took him over, thus killing him but living on as a new being, named 'Gab'. Gab then traps Standard Island into a time loop.\n\nTrivia\n\nJules Verne is the first known victim who is 'killed' by his own ability.\n\nHis ability is possibly the first one showing the 'limit break' of ability, as what he (and later Gab) did to Wells' ability - Time Machine.\n\nWhen Dazai dies on the island, No Longer Human nullifies the ability-absorbing capability, thus 'returning' Time Machine to H.G. Wells.\n\nReferences\n\nSite Navigation\n\nAbility Users Main Armed Detective Agency Members Akiko Yosano · Atsushi Nakajima · Doppo Kunikida · Jun'ichirō Tanizaki · Kenji Miyazawa · Kyōka Izumi · Osamu Dazai · Yukichi Fukuzawa Former Katai Tayama Port Mafia Members Ace† · Chūya Nakahara · Colonel† · Kōyō Ozaki · Kyūsaku Yumeno · Lippmann† · Michizō Tachihara · Motojirō Kajii · Ōgai Mori · Paul Verlaine · Randō† · Ryūnosuke Akutagawa┬ · Ryūrō Hirotsu · Osamu Dazai Former Ango Sakaguchi · Kyōka Izumi · Osamu Dazai The Guild Renewed Guild Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald · Louisa May Alcott Surviving Guild Forces John Steinbeck Former Guild Edgar Allan Poe · Herman Melville · Lucy Maud Montgomery · Margaret Mitchell · Mark Twain · Nathaniel Hawthorne Rats in the House of the Dead Alexander Pushkin · Fyodor Dostoevsky · Ivan Goncharov · Mushitarō Oguri · Nathaniel Hawthorne Decay of the Angel Bram Stoker┬ · Fyodor Dostoevsky · Kamui† · Nikolai Gogol · Sigma Hunting Dogs Members Ōchi Fukuchi† · Saigiku Jōno · Teruko Ōkura · Tetchō Suehiro Former Michizō Tachihara Order of the Clock Tower Dame Agatha Christie Sheep Chūya Nakahara Transcendents Arthur Rimbaud† · Johann Wolfgang von Goethe · Paul Verlaine · William Shakespeare · Victor Hugo Mimic André Gide† The Seven Traitors Jules Gabriel Verne† Special Division for\n\nUnusual Powers Ango Sakaguchi · Mizuki Tsujimura · Santōka Taneda V Jun Mitamura† (implied) Unaffiliated Herbert George Wells · Nemo · Sōseki Natsume · Tatsuhiko Shibusawa† · Wasp Unnamed Blond Guy† · Criminal Ability User† · Kyōka's Mother† · The Soldier† Gaiden Main Natsuhiko Kyōgoku · Mizuki Tsujimura · Yukito Ayatsuji Other Ango Sakaguchi BEAST Armed Detective Agency Akiko Yosano · Doppo Kunikida · Jun'ichirō Tanizaki · Kenji Miyazawa · Ryūnosuke Akutagawa · Sakunosuke Oda · Yukichi Fukuzawa Port Mafia Atsushi Nakajima · Chūya Nakahara · Kyōka Izumi · Osamu Dazai · Ryūrō Hirotsu"
