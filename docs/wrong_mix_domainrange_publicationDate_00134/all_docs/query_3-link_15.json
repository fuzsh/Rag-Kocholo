        "text": "You can use 'whose' but not 'who' with things.\n\n'Which' does not have a possessive. You cannot say 'the house which's chimneys are red'; for 'which's' doesn't exist. Somebody like John Lawler or Edwin Ashworth may be able to explain why.\n\nIt is perfectly alright to use 'whose' in the context in which you have shown it. My assumption that the reason for that is that 'which's' is not available.\n\nYou cannot use 'who' in the nominative or accusative case with things. You could not, for example say 'Who is the river you are discussing'. It would have to be 'Which is the river you are discussing'. Nor could you say 'The house, the chimneys of who are red'. You would have to say 'The house, the chimneys of which are red'.\n\nBut in the genitive, 'The river whose waters are muddied' is perfectly alright, for some reason which I do not fully understand. No doubt there is an interesting history to this.\n\nThe use of whose is not limited to people.\n\nMr. Waits said he had heard Mr. Kaczynski cursing the dogs, whose barking may have betrayed his location in the woods. - the New York Times Whose is not limited to people.\n\nThe cab drew up at the house whose windows were lit up. - Virginia Wolfe\n\nThe sun whose light we sail upon: A blazing summer dandelion.\n\n...an appreciable advantage in observing the moon, whose light is simply reflected... - Jules Verne\n\nThe mountain, whose peak rises around 2700 feet above average Martian surface level... - science.kqed.org\n\n... the modern-day story of how the Library of Congress came to find---and then authenticate---the rare untrimmed version of the book whose pages you will see."
