        "text": "Analysis of Complex and Compound-Complex Sentences\n\nAnalysis of Complex Sentences\n\nComplex sentences use subordinating words, or subordinators - such as after, although, as, because, before, if, since, when and where as well as relative pronouns such as that, who, whom, whose, which, and what - to join sentence parts. A complex sentence is made up of a simple sentence plus one (or more) subordinate clause(s).\n\nType your response in the text box above. (Copy and paste to save time and effort!)\n\nUse these symbols [ ] _ _ ( ) * # { } to identify the parts of each sentence as follows:\n\nPut brackets [ ] around the subject, which can be a noun, pronoun, gerund or infinitive.\n\n[subject] Put underscores _ _ around the verb, which can be transitive or intransitive\n\n_verb_ Put parentheses ( ) around each prepositional phrase\n\n(prepositional phrases) Put an asterisk after the coordinating words that join two simple sentences.\n\ncoordinating conjunction* Put a pound sign after a subordinating word\n\nsubordinator# Put curly brackets { } around the words of the subordinate clause.\n\n{subordinate clause}\n\nExercise E: Complex Sentences\n\n1. Although man's interest in space flight began many centuries ago, men were not immediately successful in their attempts. 2. When people of the ancient world challenged their knowledge of the world and attempted flight, their failures were recorded by Persian, Greek, Hindu, and Chinese legends. 3. Because most legends were about lights on earth, the Greek story about a man's trip to the moon in A.D. 160 brought a new dimension to human dreams. 4. In 1500, a Chinese scholar actually attempted space flight when he built a rocket chair and lit gunpowder under it in the hope of flying to the moon. 5. After many people in the twentieth century had read The First Men in the Moon by H. G. Wells and From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, dreams of a manned flight to the moon again became popular.\n\n1.

Today, Konstantin, Tsiolkovski, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberth are recognized as space flight pioneers because their ideas were basic to rocket design and space travel. 2. Although Tsiolkovski wrote about liquid propellants, life-support systems, and artificial satellites, he received little recognition outside of the USSR during his lifetime. 3. Goddard was responsible for much of the earliest experimentation and research in rocketry in the United States after he launched the world's first liquid propellant rocket in 1926. 4. Although Oberth's work paralleled the research of Tsiolkovski and Goddard, their writings were unknown to him until his own calculations were nearly complete. 5. If these three pioneers had not provided this theoretical knowledge, modern rocketry and space travel might be different today.\n\n1.

A compound-complex sentence is made up of two (or morel simple sentences and one {or morel subordinate clause(s).\n\nAnalyze the sentences below; follow the marking system described above.\n\n1. Although not everyone accepts the theory, immigrants from central and east Asia were probably the first inhabitants of North America, and their crossing from Siberia to Alaska brought the first humans to the continent. 2. Because edible vegetation could not exist on the Arctic bridge between Siberia and Alaska, many scholars believe that these pioneers were probably meat and fish eaters; in addition, they probably used animal fur for warmth in the harsh winter climate of the area. 3. These settlers, who are now called Indians, traveled through North America to Central and South America by 8000 B.C.; several Indian tribes and Indian languages exist today because of these early immigrants from Asia.\n\n1.
