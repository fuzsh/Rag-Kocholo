        "text": "High School Grammar & Composition (w/ Honors option): Michelle Myers(click for bio)\n\nGrammar and Composition is a two-semester course that begins with a review of traditional grammar, including parts of speech, noun usage, and basic sentence patterns and moves on to verb conjugations, phrases, and clauses before the year ends. The grammar portion of the class emphasizes usage problems, such as major grammatical errors, and common usage problems, like agreement, punctuation, and sentence construction. Concurrent with the grammar portion of the class is a course in writing. The first semester focuses on various types of paragraphs (argumentation, persuasion, comparison, analysis, etc.) of a formal, three-part nature since this type of writing is the emphasis of most standardized tests, the SAT, and colleges. During the second semester, students move on to full-length essays and conclude the year with a research paper on a general topic. Students are encouraged to use outside sources throughout the year and must practice the correct use of notes and bibliography. While this is not a reading class, per se, students will read a number of short literary works and one or two short novels to provide material for literary analysis. This course prepares students for college composition and has an Honors option available.\n\n​\n\nText: will be provided\n\nCourse Credit: 1 credit of English (with Honors option available)\n\nAvailable: 10-12th\n\nAnnual Tuition: $680\n\n​\n\nLiterature & Composition: Michelle Myers(click for bio)\n\nThe scope of this intensive language arts course covers literary analysis, grammar, beginner sentence diagramming, and formal writing practice.

(click for bio)\n\nHere is a message from your tutor: click here\n\n“Becoming a Word Slinger” is a yearlong course created to produce published authors. The course begins with the formation of an idea. The idea must be exciting enough to keep the student’s interest for an entire year. The course will end with the student having a published book in their hand and on Amazon. Some of the core values taught in this class are as follows: Focus, the power of action, making decision, controlling procrastination, the freedom in living a disciplined life, time management, consistency, and courage.\n\nThis interactive course is taught by our very own President, Lynn Pierre. As a 5-time author himself; a wealth of knowledge and experience is at your fingertips. “Becoming a Word Slinger” is excellent for the future. It will set your student apart, in the eyes of colleges, from someone who just has good grades. Imagine how your student, being a published author, would look on a transcript/resume. Studies show approximately 2,700 books are published each day. If they can do it, you student can also.\n\n​"
