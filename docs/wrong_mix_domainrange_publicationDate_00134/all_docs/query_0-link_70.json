        "text": "Jules Verne Encyclopedia:\n\n\"Franklin Fyles was the dramatic editor and critic of The New York Sun for thirty years. On September 8, 1891, he copyrighted The Californians by Jules Verne ... However ... only the title of this book seems to have been deposited. It is impossible to correlate (the) title with specific Verne works in the absence of further information.\"\n\nA \"basterdized\" rip off of Mistress Branican.\n\nThe Californians; or Captain and Captain's Wife\n\nA Graphic Story of American Enterprise and Daring by Jules Verne, Author of \"Around the World in Eighty Days.\"\n\nWritten for the Los Angeles Times\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nJune 21 to Aug 16, 1891\n\n(Only on Sundays, usually page 9 or 10)\n\n(2 Chapters per week)\n\nLos Angeles\n\nChapter 1 starts:\n\n\"The Dreadnaught\n\nThere are two chances to one that friends who are about to be seperated by a loing voyage will never see each other again -- those who are left behind may be missing upon return; those who set out may never come back again. But no such though as this bothered the heads of the seamen who were busily engaged in getting the Dreadaught ready for sea on the morning of March 15, 1875. On that day the Dreadnaught, John Allaire master, was to set sail from the port of San Diego, Cal., on a voyage through the seas of the northern Pacific.\n\n....\n\n(Paragraph 3)\n\nCaptain John Allaire was a young man just 29 with an open manly countenance full of force and decision.\n\n...\n\n(Paragraph 4)\n\nJohn Allaire had taken a wife a few years previous to the sailing of the Dreadnaught, a Miss Molly Mason -- an orphan, belonging to one of the best families in San Diego. ...\"\n\nEd: As you can see:\n\nThe Chapter 1 title was \"The Franklin\" in Mistress Branican, and here it is \"The Dreadnaught\"\n\nThe name of the ship has changed from Franklin to Dreadnaught, but its weight has remained at 900 tons.\n\nThe Date and port of sailing has remained the same: March 15, 1875 and San Diego\n\nJohn Branican has become John Allaire but he remains 29 in both.\n\nJoh Branican's wife, Dolly Starter, an orphan, has become Molly Mason, an orphan, here!\n\nIn the last few chapters, Farina Town, Australia is mentioned in BOTH versions.\n\nThere are 20 chapters here, with 16 in the original!\n\nI have NOT read the whole story, but it at least starts off \"parallelling\" the original, with just name changes.\n\nIt is obvious that someone , other than Jules, \"Wrote this for the Los Angleses Times\".\n\nHA HA -Mar 16, 2021 - I just found out that people are selling digital copies of \"Jules Verne's The Californians\" on Amazon!\n\nHA - A BAD copy of Mistress Branican! HA HA\n\nBelow: One of the LA Times announcements in June 20, 1891 newspaper.\n\n** Ed: The Californians added this to the page Mar 16, 2021.\n\n1893, May\n\nThe story starts:\n\n\"Now what hat was this? And why did Jos Merritt spend his life in searching for a hat?\n\nThis eccentric Liverpudlian was one of those inoffensive maniacs who do not belong exclusively to the United Kingdom. They are to be found on the banks of the Loire, the Elbe, the Danube, or the Escaut, as well as in the countries watered by the Thames, the Clyde and the Tweed. Jos Merritt was very rich and very well known in Lancashire and the surrounding counties as an enthusiastic ‘‘ collector.” It was not pictures, books, objects of art or even knick-knacks that he collected with great trouble and at much expense. No! It was hatsa museum of historical headgears and coiffures of any sort worn by man, woman or child.\n\nOn his own statement, he possessed some very precious historical curiosities; the helmet worn by Patrocles when he was slain by Hector at the siege of Troy; the cap used by Themistocles at the battle of Salamis; the insignia of Galen and Hippocrates; Caesar’s galea, which a blast of wind had carried off just as he crossed the Rubicon; Lucretia Borgia’s headdress for each of her weddings, with Sforza, Alphonso d’Este and Alphonso d’Aragon respectively; Tamerlin’s favorite turban in his march through Sindh; that of Genghis Khan when he destroyed Bokhara and Samarcand; Elizabeth’s coiffure at her coronation; that of Mary Stuart when she escaped from the castle of Lochleven; that of Catherine II, when she was crowned at Moscow; the cap worn by Peter the Great when he worked in the shipbuilding yards at Saardam; Marlborough’s soft hat, used by him at the battle of Ramilies; the headgear of King Olaus of Denmark, who was killed at Sticklestad; Gessler's hat which William Tell would not salute; the peaked hat that Napoleon I, wore at Wagram; and a hundred others no less curious.\n\n.......\"\n\nNot specifically mentioned in the Jules Verne Encyclopedia.\n\nMistress Branican\n\nxx (May 1893)\n\nRose Publishing Co.

John Branican was a captain, whose good ship, Franklin, left in 1875 the port of San Diego in California, ...\"\n\nALSO Announced as in print, in:\n\nThe Canadian Magazine\n\n1893, June, Vol 1, Issue 4,\n\nPage 328:\n\n\"Jules Verne's characteristic style is so well known, that to say that this novel is in keeping with the best of his former ones is, to say nearly all that can be said. Vivacious in stye, full of adventure and of the scientific imagination which has formed the chief charm of this copious writer, the tale of Mistress Branican possesses a good deal of interest, especially to boys. The book is illustrated with about 70 woodcuts.\"\n\nThis unknown listing found by James Keeline\n\nNot specifically mentioned in the Jules Verne Encyclopedia.\n\nMistress Branican\n\nnd\n\nSampson Low Marston and Co\n\nLondon\n\nNew and Cheaper edition\n\n***** This is a UNIQUE Edition\n\nAt first glance it is a regular edition of Mistress Branican with a MISPRINTED cover. The Gilt font of the Mistress Branican title on the cover is identical to the Gilt Font of the know Sampson Low editions, 1st edition and on to New and Cheaper. The font would fit over the image of John Branican amid the waves OR over the image of the sailor on the boom.\n\nBut this is a new and Cheaper edition , as per the title page, SO it would need to be the 1900, 1902, 1905 or 1906.\n\nBut let's look at the \"Jules Verne\" on the cover.\n\n1) The Jules Verne on the cover is in Gilt.\n\nOn the Sampson Low editions up to 1900, the Jules Verne is in BLACK! BUT as the 1902 image shows, the Jules Verne on that edition is now Gilt, so this edition is consistent with the New and Cheaper editions of 1902, 1905 & 1906\n\n2)BUT Look at the font. The J on the cover has an extra curl at the end (Elf Shoe - like!!!) (NOT same as 1902 edition)\n\nVS\n\n3) AND the Jules Verne is slanting to the left!!! NOT like the1902 I show as it is square, straight up and down\n\nVS\n\nSO Either this volume is a MISPRINT of the1905 or 1906 editions\n\nOR is a UNIQUE edition.\n\nAt the moment it is a mystery!\n\nImage courtesy of Glenn Gretlund"
