Bang!\n\nThe pistol shots were almost simultaneous. A cow peacefully grazing fifty yards away received one of the bullets in her back. She had nothing to do with the quarrel all the same.\n\nNeither of the adversaries was hit.\n\nWho were these two gentlemen? We do not know, although this would be an excellent opportunity to hand down their names to posterity. All we can say is that the elder was an Englishman and the younger an American, and both of them were old enough to know better.\n\nSo far as recording in what locality the inoffensive ruminant had just tasted her last tuft of herbage, nothing can be easier. It was on the left bank of Niagara, not far from the suspension bridge which joins the American to the Canadian bank three miles from the falls.\n\nThe Englishman stepped up to the American.\n\nâI contend, nevertheless, that it was âRule Britannia!ââ\n\nâAnd I say it was âYankee Doodle!ââ replied the young American.\n\nThe dispute was about to begin again when one of the secondsâdoubtless in the interests of the milk tradeâinterposed.\n\nâSuppose we say it was âRule Doodleâ and âYankee Britanniaâ and adjourn to breakfast?â\n\nThis compromise between the national airs of Great Britain and the United States was adopted to the general satisfaction. The Americans and Englishmen walked up the left bank of the Niagara on their way to Goat Island, the neutral ground between the falls. Let us leave them in the presence of the boiled eggs and traditional ham, and floods enough of tea to make the cataract jealous, and trouble ourselves no more about them. It is extremely unlikely that we shall again meet with them in this story.\n\nWhich was right; the Englishman or the American? It is not easy to say. Anyhow the duel shows how great was the excitement, not only in the new but also in the old world, with regard to an inexplicable phenomenon which for a month or more had driven everybody to distraction.\n\nNever had the sky been so much looked at since the appearance of man on the terrestrial globe. The night before an aerial trumpet had blared its brazen notes through space immediately over that part of Canada between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Some people had heard those notes as âYankee Doodle.â others had heard them as âRule Britannia.â and hence the quarrel between the Anglo-Saxons, which ended with the breakfast on Goat Island. Perhaps it was neither one nor the other of these patriotic tunes, but what was undoubted by all was that these extraordinary sounds had seemed to descend from the sky to the earth.\n\nWhat could it be? Was it some exuberant aeronaut rejoicing on that sonorous instrument of which the RenommÃ©e makes such obstreperous use?\n\nNo! There was no balloon and there were no aeronauts. Some strange phenomenon had occurred in the higher zones of the atmosphere, a phenomenon of which neither the nature nor the cause could be explained. Today it appeared over America; forty-eight hours afterwards it was over Europe; a week later it was in Asia over the Celestial Empire.\n\nHence in every country of the worldâempire, kingdom, or republicâthere was anxiety which it was important to allay. If you hear in your house strange and inexplicable noises, do you not at once endeavor to discover the cause? And if your search is in vain, do you not leave your house and take up your quarters in another? But in this case the house was the terrestrial globe! There are no means of leaving that house for the moon or Mars, or Venus, or Jupiter, or any other planet of the solar system. And so of necessity we have to find out what it is that takes place, not in the infinite void, but within the atmospherical zones. In fact, if there is no air there is no noise, and as there was a noiseâthat famous trumpet, to witâthe phenomenon must occur in the air, the density of which invariably diminishes, and which does not extend for more than six miles round our spheroid.\n\nNaturally the newspapers took up the question in their thousands, and treated it in every form, throwing on it both light and darkness, recording many things about it true or false, alarming and tranquillizing their readersâas the sale requiredâand almost driving ordinary people mad. At one blow party politics dropped unheededâand the affairs of the world went on none the worse for it.\n\nBut what could this thing be? There was not an observatory that was not applied to. If an observatory could not give a satisfactory answer what was the use of observatories? If astronomers, who doubled and tripled the stars a hundred thousand million miles away, could not explain a phenomenon occurring only a few miles off, what was the use of astronomers?\n\nThe observatory at Paris was very guarded in what it said. In the mathematical section they had not thought the statement worth noticing; in the meridional section they knew nothing about it; in the physical observatory they had not come across it; in the geodetic section they had had no observation; in the meteorological section there had been no record; in the calculating room they had had nothing to deal with. At any rate this confession was a frank one, and the same frankness characterized the replies from the observatory of Montsouris and the magnetic station in the park of St. Maur. The same respect for the truth distinguished the Bureau des Longitudes.\n\nThe provinces were slightly more affirmative. Perhaps in the night of the fifth and the morning of the sixth of May there had appeared a flash of light of electrical origin which lasted about twenty seconds. At the Pic du Midi this light appeared between nine and ten in the evening. At the Meteorological Observatory on the Puy de Dome the light had been observed between one and two oâclock in the morning; at Mont Ventoux in Provence it had been seen between two and three oâclock; at Nice it had been noticed between three and four oâclock; while at the Semnoz Alps between Annecy, Le Bourget, and Le LÃ©man, it had been detected just as the zenith was paling with the dawn.\n\nNow it evidently would not do to disregard these observations altogether. There could be no doubt that a light had been observed at different places, in succession, at intervals, during some hours. Hence, whether it had been produced from many centers in the terrestrial atmosphere, or from one center, it was plain that the light must have traveled at a speed of over one hundred and twenty miles an hour.\n\nIn the United Kingdom there was much perplexity. The observatories were not in agreement. Greenwich would not consent to the proposition of Oxford. They were agreed on one point, however, and that was: âIt was nothing at all!â\n\nBut, said one, âIt was an optical illusion!â While the other contended that, âIt was an acoustical illusion!â And so they disputed. Something, however, was, it will be seen, common to both âIt was an illusion.â\n\nBetween the observatory of Berlin and the observatory of Vienna the discussion threatened to end in international complications; but Russia, in the person of the director of the observatory at Pulkowa, showed that both were right. It all depended on the point of view from which they attacked the phenomenon, which, though impossible in theory, was possible in practice.\n\nIn Switzerland, at the observatory of Sautis in the canton of Appenzell, at the Righi, at the GÃ¤briss, in the passes of the St. Gothard, at the St. Bernard, at the Julier, at the Simplon, at Zurich, at Somblick in the Tyrolean Alps, there was a very strong disinclination to say anything about what nobody could proveâand that was nothing but reasonable.\n\nBut in Italy, at the meteorological stations on Vesuvius, on Etna in the old Casa Inglesi, at Monte Cavo, the observers made no hesitation in admitting the materiality of the phenomenon, particularly as they had seen it by day in the form of a small cloud of vapor, and by night in that of a shooting star. But of what it was they knew nothing.\n\nScientists began at last to tire of the mystery, while they continued to disagree about it, and even to frighten the lowly and the ignorant, who, thanks to one of the wisest laws of nature, have formed, form, and will form the immense majority of the worldâs inhabitants. Astronomers and meteorologists would soon have dropped the subject altogether had not, on the night of the 26th and 27th, the observatory of Kautokeino at Finmark, in Norway, and during the night of the 28th and 29th that of Isfjord at SpitzbergenâNorwegian one and Swedish the otherâfound themselves agreed in recording that in the center of an aurora borealis there had appeared a sort of huge bird, an aerial monster, whose structure they were unable to determine, but who, there was no doubt, was showering off from his body certain corpuscles which exploded like bombs.\n\nIn Europe not a doubt was thrown on this observation of the stations in Finmark and Spitzbergen. But what appeared the most phenomenal about it was that the Swedes and Norwegians could find themselves in agreement on any subject whatever.\n\nThere was a laugh at the asserted discovery in all the observatories of South America, in Brazil, Peru, and La Plata, and in those of Australia at Sydney, Adelaide, and Melbourne; and Australian laughter is very catching.\n\nTo sum up, only one chief of a meteorological station ventured on a decided answer to this question, notwithstanding the sarcasms that his solution provoked. This was a Chinaman, the director of the observatory at Zi-Ka-Wey which rises in the center of a vast plateau less than thirty miles from the sea, having an immense horizon and wonderfully pure atmosphere. âIt is possible.â said he, âthat the object was an aviform apparatusâa flying machine!â\n\nWhat nonsense!\n\nBut if the controversy was keen in the old world, we can imagine what it was like in that portion of the new of which the United States occupy so vast an area.\n\nA Yankee, we know, does not waste time on the road. He takes the street that leads him straight to his end. And the observatories of the American Federation did not hesitate to do their best. If they did not hurl their objectives at each otherâs heads, it was because they would have had to put them back just when they most wanted to use them. In this much-disputed question the observatories of Washington in the District of Columbia, and Cambridge in Massachusetts, found themselves opposed by those of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and Ann Arbor in Michigan. The subject of their dispute was not the nature of the body observed, but the precise moment of its observation. All of them claimed to have seen it the same night, the same hour, the same minute, the same second, although the trajectory of the mysterious voyager took it but a moderate height above the horizon. Now from Massachusetts to Michigan, from New Hampshire to Columbia, the distance is too great for this double observation, made at the same moment, to be considered possible.\n\nDudley at Albany, in the state of New York, and West Point, the military academy, showed that their colleagues were wrong by an elaborate calculation of the right ascension and declination of the aforesaid body.\n\nBut later on it was discovered that the observers had been deceived in the body, and that what they had seen was an aerolite. This aerolite could not be the object in question, for how could an aerolite blow a trumpet?\n\nIt was in vain that they tried to get rid of this trumpet as an optical illusion. The ears were no more deceived than the eyes. Something had assuredly been seen, and something had assuredly been heard. In the night of the 12th and 13th of Mayâa very dark nightâthe observers at Yale College, in the Sheffield Science School, had been able to take down a few bars of a musical phrase in D major, common time, which gave note for note, rhythm for rhythm, the chorus of the Chant du DÃ©part.\n\nâGood.â said the Yankee wags. âThere is a French band well up in the air.â\n\nâBut to joke is not to answer.â Thus said the observatory at Boston, founded by the Atlantic Iron Works Society, whose opinions in matters of astronomy and meteorology began to have much weight in the world of science.\n\nThen there intervened the observatory at Cincinnati, founded in 1870, on Mount Lookout, thanks to the generosity of Mr. Kilgour, and known for its micrometrical measurements of double stars. Its director declared with the utmost good faith that there had certainly been something, that a traveling body had shown itself at very short periods at different points in the atmosphere, but what were the nature of this body, its dimensions, its speed, and its trajectory, it was impossible to say.\n\nIt was then a journal whose publicity is immenseâthe âNew York Heraldââreceived the anonymous contribution hereunder.\n\nâThere will be in the recollection of most people the rivalry which existed a few years ago between the two heirs of the Begum of Ragginahra, the French doctor Sarrasin, the city of Frankville, and the German engineer Schultze, in the city of Steeltown, both in the south of Oregon in the United States.\n\nâIt will not have been forgotten that, with the object of destroying Frankville, Herr Schultze launched a formidable engine, intended to beat down the town and annihilate it at a single blow.\n\nâStill less will it be forgotten that this engine, whose initial velocity as it left the mouth of the monster cannon had been erroneously calculated, had flown off at a speed exceeding by sixteen times that of ordinary projectilesâor about four hundred and fifty miles an hourâthat it did not fall to the ground, and that it passed into an aerolitic stage, so as to circle for ever round our globe.\n\nâWhy should not this be the body in question?â\n\nVery ingenious, Mr. Correspondent on the âNew York Herald!â but how about the trumpet? There was no trumpet in Herr Schulzeâs projectile!\n\nSo all the explanations explained nothing, and all the observers had observed in vain. There remained only the suggestion offered by the director of Zi-Ka-Wey. But the opinion of a Chinaman!\n\nThe discussion continued, and there was no sign of agreement. Then came a short period of rest. Some days elapsed without any object, aerolite or otherwise, being described, and without any trumpet notes being heard in the atmosphere. The body then had fallen on some part of the globe where it had been difficult to trace it; in the sea, perhaps. Had it sunk in the depths of the Atlantic, the Pacific, or the Indian Ocean? What was to be said in this matter?\n\nBut then, between the 2nd and 9th of June, there came a new series of facts which could not possibly be explained by the unaided existence of a cosmic phenomenon.\n\nIn a week the Hamburgers at the top of St. Michaelâs Tower, the Turks on the highest minaret of St. Sophia, the Rouennais at the end of the metal spire of their cathedral, the Strasburgers at the summit of their minister, the Americans on the head of the Liberty statue at the entrance of the Hudson and on the Bunker Hill monument at Boston, the Chinese at the spike of the temple of the Four Hundred Genii at Canton, the Hindus on the sixteenth terrace of the pyramid of the temple at Tanjore, the San Pietrini at the cross of St. Peterâs at Rome, the English at the cross of St. Paulâs in London, the Egyptians at the apex of the Great Pyramid of Ghizeh, the Parisians at the lighting conductor of the iron tower of the Exposition of 1889, a thousand feet high, all of them beheld a flag floating from some one of these inaccessible points.\n\nAnd the flag was black, dotted with stars, and it bore a golden sun in its center.\n\nChapter II\n\nAGREEMENT IMPOSSIBLE\n\nâAnd the first who says the contraryââ\n\nâIndeed! But we will say the contrary so long as there is a place to say it in!â\n\nâAnd in spite of your threatsââ\n\nâMind what you are saying, Bat Fynn!â\n\nâMind what you are saying, Uncle Prudent!â\n\nâI maintain that the screw ought to be behind!â\n\nâAnd so do we! And so do we!â replied half a hundred voices confounded in one.\n\nâNo! It ought to be in front!â shouted Phil Evans.\n\nâIn front!â roared fifty other voices, with a vigor in no whit less remarkable.\n\nâWe shall never agree!â\n\nâNever! Never!â\n\nâThen what is the use of a dispute?â\n\nâIt is not a dispute! It is a discussion!â\n\nOne would not have thought so to listen to the taunts, objurgations, and vociferations which filled the lecture room for a good quarter of an hour.\n\nThe room was one of the largest in the Weldon Institute, the well-known club in Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U. S. A. The evening before there had been an election of a lamplighter, occasioning many public manifestations, noisy meetings, and even interchanges of blows, resulting in an effervescence which had not yet subsided, and which would account for some of the excitement just exhibited by the members of the Weldon Institute. For this was merely a meeting of balloonists, discussing the burning question of the direction of balloons.\n\nIn this great saloon there were struggling, pushing, gesticulating, shouting, arguing, disputing, a hundred balloonists, all with their hats on, under the authority of a president, assisted by a secretary and treasurer. They were not engineers by profession, but simply amateurs of all that appertained to aerostatics, and they were amateurs in a fury, and especially foes of those who would oppose to aerostats âapparatuses heavier than the air.â flying machines, aerial ships, or what not. That these people might one day discover the method of guiding balloons is possible. There could be no doubt that their president had considerable difficulty in guiding them.\n\nThis president, well known in Philadelphia, was the famous Uncle Prudent, Prudent being his family name. There is nothing surprising in America in the qualificative uncle, for you can there be uncle without having either nephew or niece. There they speak of uncle as in other places they speak of father, though the father may have had no children.\n\nUncle Prudent was a personage of consideration, and in spite of his name was well known for his audacity. He was very rich, and that is no drawback even in the United States; and how could it be otherwise when he owned the greater part of the shares in Niagara Falls? A society of engineers had just been founded at Buffalo for working the cataract. It seemed to be an excellent speculation. The seven thousand five hundred cubic meters that pass over Niagara in a second would produce seven millions of horsepower. This enormous power, distributed amongst all the workshops within a radius of three hundred miles, would return an annual income of three hundred million dollars, of which the greater part would find its way into the pocket of Uncle Prudent. He was a bachelor, he lived quietly, and for his only servant had his valet Frycollin, who was hardly worthy of being the servant to so audacious a master.\n\nUncle Prudent was rich, and therefore he had friends, as was natural; but he also had enemies, although he was president of the clubâamong others all those who envied his position. Amongst his bitterest foes we may mention the secretary of the Weldon Institute.\n\nThis was Phil Evans, who was also very rich, being the manager of the Wheelton Watch Company, an important manufactory, which makes every day five hundred movements equal in every respect to the best Swiss workmanship. Phil Evans would have passed for one of the happiest men in the world, and even in the United States, if it had not been for Uncle Prudent. Like him he was in his forty-sixth year; like him of invariable health; like him of undoubted boldness. They were two men made to understand each other thoroughly, but they did not, for both were of extreme violence of character. Uncle Prudent was furiously hot; Phil Evans was abnormally cool.\n\nAnd why had not Phil Evans been elected president of the club? The votes were exactly divided between Uncle Prudent and him. Twenty times there had been a scrutiny, and twenty times the majority had not declared for either one or the other. The position was embarrassing, and it might have lasted for the lifetime of the candidates.\n\nOne of the members of the club then proposed a way out of the difficulty. This was Jem Chip, the treasurer of the Weldon Institute. Chip was a confirmed vegetarian, a proscriber of all animal nourishment, of all fermented liquors, half a Mussulman, half a Brahman. On this occasion Jem Chip was supported by another member of the club, William T. Forbes, the manager of a large factory where they made glucose by treating rags with sulphuric acid. A man of good standing was this William T. Forbes, the father of two charming girlsâMiss Dorothy, called Doll, and Miss Martha, called Mat, who gave the tone to the best society in Philadelphia.\n\nIt followed, then, on the proposition of Jem Chip, supported by William T. Forbes and others, that it was decided to elect the president âon the center point.â\n\nThis mode of election can be applied in all cases when it is desired to elect the most worthy; and a number of Americans of high intelligence are already thinking of employing it in the nomination of the President of the Republic of the United States.\n\nOn two boards of perfect whiteness a black line is traced. The length of each of these lines is mathematically the same, for they have been determined with as much accuracy as the base of the first triangle in a trigonometrical survey. That done, the two boards were erected on the same day in the center of the conference room, and the two candidates, each armed with a fine needle, marched towards the board that had fallen to his lot. The man who planted his needle nearest the center of the line would be proclaimed President of the Weldon Institute.\n\nThe operation must be done at onceâno guide marks or trial shots allowed; nothing but sureness of eye. The man must have a compass in his eye, as the saying goes; that was all.\n\nUncle Prudent stuck in his needle at the same moment as Phil Evans did his. Then there began the measurement to discover which of the two competitors had most nearly approached the center.\n\nWonderful! Such had been the precision of the shots that the measures gave no appreciable difference. If they were not exactly in the mathematical center of the line, the distance between the needles was so small as to be invisible to the naked eye.\n\nThe meeting was much embarrassed.\n\nFortunately one of the members, Truck Milnor, insisted that the measurements should be remade by means of a rule graduated by the micrometrical machine of M. Perreaux, which can divide a millimeter into fifteen-hundredths of a millimeter with a diamond splinter, was brought to bear on the lines; and on reading the divisions through a microscope the following were the results: Uncle Prudent had approached the center within less than six fifteenth-hundredths of a millimeter. Phil Evans was within nine fifteen-hundredths.\n\nAnd that is why Phil Evans was only secretary of the Weldon Institute, whereas Uncle Prudent was president. A difference of three fifteen-hundredths of a millimeter! And on account of it Phil Evans vowed against Uncle Prudent one of those hatreds which are none the less fierce for being latent.\n\nChapter III\n\nA VISITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n\nThe many experiments made during this last quarter of the nineteenth century have given considerable impetus to the question of guidable balloons. The cars furnished with propellers attached in 1852 to the aerostats of the elongated form introduced by Henry Giffard, the machines of Dupuy de Lome in 1872, of the Tissandier brothers in 1883, and of Captain Krebs and Renard in 1884, yielded many important results. But if these machines, moving in a medium heavier than themselves, maneuvering under the propulsion of a screw, working at an angle to the direction of the wind, and even against the wind, to return to their point of departure, had been really âguidable.â they had only succeeded under very favorable conditions. In large, covered halls their success was perfect. In a calm atmosphere they did very well. In a light wind of five or six yards a second they still moved. But nothing practical had been obtained. Against a millerâs windânine yards a secondâthe machines had remained almost stationary. Against a fresh breezeâeleven yards a secondâthey would have advanced backwards. In a stormâtwenty-seven to thirty-three yards a secondâthey would have been blown about like a feather. In a hurricaneâsixty yards a secondâthey would have run the risk of being dashed to pieces. And in one of those cyclones which exceed a hundred yards a second not a fragment of them would have been left. It remained, then, even after the striking experiments of Captains Krebs and Renard, that though guidable aerostats had gained a little speed, they could not be kept going in a moderate breeze. Hence the impossibility of making practical use of this mode of aerial locomotion.\n\nWith regards to the means employed to give the aerostat its motion a great deal of progress had been made. For the steam engines of Henry Giffard, and the muscular force of Dupuy de Lome, electric motors had gradually been substituted. The batteries of bichromate of potassium of the Tissandier brothers had given a speed of four yards a second. The dynamo-electric machines of Captain Krebs and Renard had developed a force of twelve horsepower and yielded a speed of six and a half yards per second.\n\nWith regard to this motor, engineers and electricians had been approaching more and more to that desideratum which is known as a steam horse in a watch case. Gradually the results of the pile of which Captains Krebs and Renard had kept the secret had been surpassed, and aeronauts had become able to avail themselves of motors whose lightness increased at the same time as their power.\n\nIn this there was much to encourage those who believed in the utilization of guidable balloons. But yet how many good people there are who refuse to admit the possibility of such a thing! If the aerostat finds support in the air it belongs to the medium in which it moves; under such conditions, how can its mass, which offers so much resistance to the currents of the atmosphere, make its way against the wind?\n\nIn this struggle of the inventors after a light and powerful motor, the Americans had most nearly attained what they sought. A dynamo-electric apparatus, in which a new pile was employed the composition of which was still a mystery, had been bought from its inventor, a Boston chemist up to then unknown. Calculations made with the greatest care, diagrams drawn with the utmost exactitude, showed that by means of this apparatus driving a screw of given dimensions a displacement could be obtained of from twenty to twenty-two yards a second.\n\nNow this was magnificent!\n\nâAnd it is not dear.â said Uncle Prudent, as he handed to the inventor in return for his formal receipt the last installment of the hundred thousand paper dollars he had paid for his invention.\n\nImmediately the Weldon Institute set to work. When there comes along a project of practical utility the money leaps nimbly enough from American pockets. The funds flowed in even without its being necessary to form a syndicate. Three hundred thousand dollars came into the clubâs account at the first appeal. The work began under the superintendence of the most celebrated aeronaut of the United States, Harry W. Tinder, immortalized by three of his ascents out of a thousand, one in which he rose to a height of twelve thousand yards, higher than Gay Lussac, Coxwell, Sivet, CrocÃ©-Spinelli, Tissandier, Glaisher; another in which he had crossed America from New York to San Francisco, exceeding by many hundred leagues the journeys of Nadar, Godard, and others, to say nothing of that of John Wise, who accomplished eleven hundred and fifty miles from St. Louis to Jefferson county; the third, which ended in a frightful fall from fifteen hundred feet at the cost of a slight sprain in the right thumb, while the less fortunate PilÃ¢tre de Rozier fell only seven hundred feet, and yet killed himself on the spot!\n\nAt the time this story begins the Weldon Institute had got their work well in hand. In the Turner yard at Philadelphia there reposed an enormous aerostat, whose strength had been tried by highly compressed air. It well merited the name of the monster balloon.\n\nHow large was Nadarâs GÃ©ant? Six thousand cubic meters. How large was John Wiseâs balloon? Twenty thousand cubic meters. How large was the Giffard balloon at the 1878 Exhibition? Twenty-five thousand cubic meters. Compare these three aerostats with the aerial machine of the Weldon Institute, whose volume amounted to forty thousand cubic meters, and you will understand why Uncle Prudent and his colleagues were so justifiably proud of it.\n\nThis balloon not being destined for the exploration of the higher strata of the atmosphere, was not called the Excelsior, a name which is rather too much held in honor among the citizens of America. No! It was called, simply, the âGo-Ahead.â and all it had to do was to justify its name by going ahead obediently to the wishes of its commander.\n\nThe dynamo-electric machine, according to the patent purchased by the Weldon Institute, was nearly ready. In less than six weeks the âGo-Aheadâ would start for its first cruise through space.\n\nBut, as we have seen, all the mechanical difficulties had not been overcome. Many evenings had been devoted to discussing, not the form of its screw nor its dimensions, but whether it ought to be put behind, as the Tissandier brothers had done, or before as Captains Krebs and Renard had done. It is unnecessary to add that the partisans of the two systems had almost come to blows. The group of âBeforistsâ were equaled in number by the group of âBehindists.â Uncle Prudent, who ought to have given the casting voteâUncle Prudent, brought up doubtless in the school of Professor Buridanâcould not bring himself to decide.\n\nHence the impossibility of getting the screw into place. The dispute might last for some time, unless the government interfered. But in the United States the government meddles with private affairs as little as it possibly can. And it is right.\n\nThings were in this state at this meeting on the 13th of June, which threatened to end in a riotâinsults exchanged, fisticuffs succeeding the insults, cane thrashings succeeding the fisticuffs, revolver shots succeeding the cane thrashingsâwhen at thirty-seven minutes past eight there occurred a diversion.\n\nThe porter of the Weldon Institute coolly and calmly, like a policeman amid the storm of the meeting, approached the presidential desk. On it he placed a card. He awaited the orders that Uncle Prudent found it convenient to give.\n\nUncle Prudent turned on the steam whistle, which did duty for the presidential bell, for even the Kremlin clock would have struck in vain! But the tumult slackened not.\n\nThen the president removed his hat. Thanks to this extreme measure a semi-silence was obtained.\n\nâA communication!â said Uncle Prudent, after taking a huge pinch from the snuff-box which never left him.\n\nâSpeak up!â answered eighty-nine voices, accidentally in agreement on this one point.\n\nâA stranger, my dear colleagues, asks to be admitted to the meeting.â\n\nâNever!â replied every voice.\n\nâHe desires to prove to us, it would appear.â continued Uncle Prudent, âthat to believe in guiding balloons is to believe in the absurdest of Utopias!â\n\nâLet him in! Let him in!â\n\nâWhat is the name of this singular personage?â asked secretary Phil Evans.\n\nâRobur.â replied Uncle Prudent.\n\nâRobur! Robur! Robur!â yelled the assembly. And the welcome accorded so quickly to the curious name was chiefly due to the Weldon Institute hoping to vent its exasperation on the head of him who bore it!\n\nChapter IV\n\nIN WHICH A NEW CHARACTER APPEARS\n\nâCitizens of the United States! My name is Robur. I am worthy of the name! I am forty years old, although I look but thirty, and I have a constitution of iron, a healthy vigor that nothing can shake, a muscular strength that few can equal, and a digestion that would be thought first class even in an ostrich!â\n\nThey were listening! Yes! The riot was quelled at once by the totally unexpected fashion of the speech. Was this fellow a madman or a hoaxer? Whoever he was, he kept his audience in hand. There was not a whisper in the meeting in which but a few minutes ago the storm was in full fury.\n\nAnd Robur looked the man he said he was. Of middle height and geometric breadth, his figure was a regular trapezium with the greatest of its parallel sides formed by the line of his shoulders. On this line attached by a robust neck there rose an enormous spheroidal head. The head of what animal did it resemble from the point of view of passional analogy? The head of a bull; but a bull with an intelligent face. Eyes which at the least opposition would glow like coals of fire; and above them a permanent contraction of the superciliary muscle, an invariable sign of extreme energy. Short hair, slightly woolly, with metallic reflections; large chest rising and falling like a smithâs bellows; arms, hands, legs, feet, all worthy of the trunk. No mustaches, no whiskers, but a large American goatee, revealing the attachments of the jaw whose masseter muscles were evidently of formidable strength. It has been calculatedâwhat has not been calculated?âthat the pressure of the jaw of an ordinary crocodile can reach four hundred atmospheres, while that of a hound can only amount to one hundred. From this the following curious formula has been deduced: If a kilogram of dog produces eight kilograms of masseteric force, a kilogram of crocodile could produce twelve. Now, a kilogram of, the aforesaid Robur would not produce less than ten, so that he came between the dog and the crocodile.\n\nFrom what country did this remarkable specimen come? It was difficult to say. One thing was noticeable, and that was that he expressed himself fluently in English without a trace of the drawling twang that distinguishes the Yankees of New England.\n\nHe continued: âAnd now, honorable citizens, for my mental faculties. You see before you an engineer whose nerves are in no way inferior to his muscles. I have no fear of anything or anybody. I have a strength of will that has never had to yield. When I have decided on a thing, all America, all the world, may strive in vain to keep me from it. When I have an idea, I allow no one to share it, and I do not permit any contradiction. I insist on these details, honorable citizens, because it is necessary you should quite understand me. Perhaps you think I am talking too much about myself? It does not matter if you do! And now consider a little before you interrupt me, as I have come to tell you something that you may not be particularly pleased to hear.â\n\nA sound as of the surf on the beach began to rise along the first row of seatsâa sign that the sea would not be long in getting stormy again.\n\nâSpeak, stranger!â said Uncle Prudent, who had some difficulty in restraining himself.\n\nAnd Robur spoke as follows, without troubling himself any more about his audience.\n\nâYes! I know it well! After a century of experiments that have led to nothing, and trials giving no results, there still exist ill-balanced minds who believe in guiding balloons. They imagine that a motor of some sort, electric or otherwise, might be applied to their pretentious skin bags which are at the mercy of every current in the atmosphere. They persuade themselves that they can be masters of an aerostat as they can be masters of a ship on the surface of the sea. Because a few inventors in calm or nearly calm weather have succeeded in working an angle with the wind, or even beating to windward in a gentle breeze, they think that the steering of aerial apparatus lighter than the air is a practical matter. Well, now, look here; You hundred, who believe in the realization of your dreams, are throwing your thousands of dollars not into water but into space! You are fighting the impossible!â\n\nStrange as it was that at this affirmation the members of the Weldon Institute did not move. Had they become as deaf as they were patient? Or were they reserving themselves to see how far this audacious contradictor would dare to go?\n\nRobur continued: âWhat? A balloon! When to obtain the raising of a couple of pounds you require a cubic yard of gas. A balloon pretending to resist the wind by aid of its mechanism, when the pressure of a light breeze on a vesselâs sails is not less than that of four hundred horsepower; when in the accident at the Tay Bridge you saw the storm produce a pressure of eight and a half hundredweight on a square yard. A balloon, when on such a system nature has never constructed anything flying, whether furnished with wings like birds, or membranes like certain fish, or certain mammaliaââ\n\nâMammalia?â exclaimed one of the members.\n\nâYes! Mammalia! The bat, which flies, if I am not mistaken! Is the gentleman unaware that this flyer is a mammal? Did he ever see an omelette made of batâs eggs?â\n\nThe interrupter reserved himself for future interruption, and Robur resumed: âBut does that mean that man is to give up the conquest of the air, and the transformation of the domestic and political manners of the old world, by the use of this admirable means of locomotion? By no means. As he has become master of the seas with the ship, by the oar, the sail, the wheel and the screw, so shall he become master of atmospherical space by apparatus heavier than the airâfor it must be heavier to be stronger than the air!â\n\nAnd then the assembly exploded. What a broadside of yells escaped from all these mouths, aimed at Robur like the muzzles of so many guns! Was not this hurling a declaration of war into the very camp of the balloonists? Was not this a stirring up of strife between âthe lighterâ and âthe heavierâ than air?\n\nRobur did not even frown. With folded arms he waited bravely till silence was obtained.\n\nBy a gesture Uncle Prudent ordered the firing to cease.\n\nâYes.â continued Robur, âthe future is for the flying machine. The air affords a solid fulcrum. If you will give a column of air an ascensional movement of forty-five meters a second, a man can support himself on the top of it if the soles of his boots have a superficies of only the eighth of a square meter. And if the speed be increased to ninety meters, he can walk on it with naked feet. Or if, by means of a screw, you drive a mass of air at this speed, you get the same result.â\n\nWhat Robur said had been said before by all the partisans of aviation, whose work slowly but surely is leading on to the solution of the problem. To Ponton dâAmÃ©court, La Landelle, Nadar, De Luzy, De LouvriÃ©, Liais, Beleguir, Moreau, the brothers Richard, Babinet, Jobert, Du Temple, Salives, Penaud, De Villeneuve, Gauchot and Tatin, Michael Loup, Edison, Planavergne, and so many others, belongs the honor of having brought forward ideas of such simplicity. Abandoned and resumed times without number, they are sure, some day to triumph. To the enemies of aviation, who urge that the bird only sustains himself by warming the air he strikes, their answer is ready. Have they not proved that an eagle weighing five kilograms would have to fill fifty cubic meters with his warm fluid merely to sustain himself in space?\n\nThis is what Robur demonstrated with undeniable logic amid the uproar that arose on all sides. And in conclusion these are the words he hurled in the faces of the balloonists: âWith your aerostats you can do nothingâyou will arrive at nothingâyou dare do nothing! The boldest of your aeronauts, John Wise, although he has made an aerial voyage of twelve hundred miles above the American continent, has had to give up his project of crossing the Atlantic! And you have not advanced one stepânot one stepâtowards your end.â\n\nâSir.â said the president, who in vain endeavored to keep himself cool, âyou forget what was said by our immortal Franklin at the first appearance of the fire balloon, âIt is but a child, but it will grow!â It was but a child, and it has grown.â\n\nâNo, Mr. President, it has not grown! It has got fatterâand this is not the same thing!â\n\nThis was a direct attack on the Weldon Institute, which had decreed, helped, and paid for the making of a monster balloon. And so propositions of the following kind began to fly about the room: âTurn him out!â âThrow him off the platform!â âProve that he is heavier than the air!â\n\nBut these were only words, not means to an end.\n\nRobur remained impassible, and continued: âThere is no progress for your aerostats, my citizen balloonists; progress is for flying machines. The bird flies, and he is not a balloon, he is a piece of mechanism!â\n\nâYes, he flies!â exclaimed the fiery Bat T. Fynn; âbut he flies against all the laws of mechanics.â\n\nâIndeed!â said Robur, shrugging his shoulders, and resuming, âSince we have begun the study of the flight of large and small birds one simple idea has prevailedâto imitate nature, which never makes mistakes. Between the albatross, which gives hardly ten beats of the wing per minute, between the pelican, which gives seventyââ\n\nâSeventy-one.â said the voice of a scoffer.\n\nâAnd the bee, which gives one hundred and ninety-two per secondââ\n\nâOne hundred and ninety-three!â said the facetious individual.\n\nâAnd, the common house fly, which gives three hundred and thirtyââ\n\nâAnd a half!â\n\nâAnd the mosquito, which gives millionsââ\n\nâNo, milliards!â\n\nBut Robur, the interrupted, interrupted not his demonstration. âBetween these different ratesââ he continued.\n\nâThere is a difference.â said a voice.\n\nâThere is a possibility of finding a practical solution. When De Lucy showed that the stag beetle, an insect weighing only two grammes, could lift a weight of four hundred grammes, or two hundred times its own weight, the problem of aviation was solved. Besides, it has been shown that the wing surface decreases in proportion to the increase of the size and weight of the animal. Hence we can look forward to such contrivancesââ\n\nâWhich would never fly!â said secretary Phil Evans.\n\nâWhich have flown, and which will fly.â said Robur, without being in the least disconcerted, âand which we can call streophores, helicopters, orthoptersâor, in imitation of the word ânef,â which comes from ânavis,â call them from âavis,â âefs,ââby means of which man will become the master of space. The helixââ\n\nâAh, the helix!â replied Phil Evans. âBut the bird has no helix; that we know!â\n\nâSo.â said Robur; âbut Penaud has shown that in reality the bird makes a helix, and its flight is helicopteral. And the motor of the future is the screwââ\n\nâFrom such a maladee Saint Helix keep us free!â sung out one of the members, who had accidentally hit upon the air from Heroldâs âZampa.â\n\nAnd they all took up the chorus: âFrom such a maladee Saint Helix keep us free!â with such intonations and variations as would have made the French composer groan in his grave.\n\nAs the last notes died away in a frightful discord Uncle Prudent took advantage of the momentary calm to say, âStranger, up to now, we let you speak without interruption.â It seemed that for the president of the Weldon Institute shouts, yells, and catcalls were not interruptions, but only an exchange of arguments.\n\nâBut I may remind you, all the same, that the theory of aviation is condemned beforehand, and rejected by the majority of American and foreign engineers. It is a system which was the cause of the death of the Flying Saracen at Constantinople, of the monk Volador at Lisbon, of De Leturn in 1852, of De Groof in 1864, besides the victims I forget since the mythological Icarusââ\n\nâA system.â replied Robur, âno more to be condemned than that whose martyrology contains the names of PilÃ¢tre de Rozier at Calais, of Blanchard at Paris, of Donaldson and Grimwood in Lake Michigan, of Sivel and of CrocÃ©-Spinelli, and others whom it takes good care, to forget.â\n\nThis was a counter-thrust with a vengeance.\n\nâBesides.â continued Robur, âWith your balloons as good as you can make them you will never obtain any speed worth mentioning. It would take you ten years to go round the worldâand a flying machine could do it in a week!â\n\nHere arose a new tempest of protests and denials which lasted for three long minutes. And then Phil Evans look up the word.\n\nâMr. Aviator.â he said âyou who talk so much of the benefits of aviation, have you ever aviated?â\n\nâI have.â\n\nâAnd made the conquest of the air?â\n\nâNot unlikely.â\n\nâHooray for Robur the Conqueror!â shouted an ironical voice.\n\nâWell, yes! Robur the Conqueror! I accept the name and I will bear it, for I have a right to it!â\n\nâWe beg to doubt it!â said Jem Chip.\n\nâGentlemen.â said Robur, and his brows knit, âwhen I have just seriously stated a serious thing I do not permit anyone to reply to me by a flat denial, and I shall be glad to know the name of the interrupter.â\n\nâMy name is Chip, and I am a vegetarian.â\n\nâCitizen Chip.â said Robur, âI knew that vegetarians had longer alimentary canals than other menâa good foot longer at the least. That is quite long enough; and so do not compel me to make you any longer by beginning at your ears andââ\n\nâThrow him out.â\n\nâInto the street with him!â\n\nâLynch him!â\n\nâHelix him!â\n\nThe rage of the balloonists burst forth at last. They rushed at the platform. Robur disappeared amid a sheaf of hands that were thrown about as if caught in a storm. In vain the steam whistle screamed its fanfares on to the assembly. Philadelphia might well think that a fire was devouring one of its quarters and that all the waters of the Schuyllkill could not put it out.\n\nSuddenly there was a recoil in the tumult. Robur had put his hands into his pockets and now held them out at the front ranks of the infuriated mob.\n\nIn each hand was one of those American institutions known as revolvers which the mere pressure of the fingers is enough to fireâpocket mitrailleuses in fact.\n\nAnd taking advantage not only of the recoil of his assailants but also of the silence which accompanied it.\n\nâDecidedly.â said he, âit was not Amerigo that discovered the New World, it was Cabot! You are not Americans, citizen balloonists! You are only Caboââ\n\nFour or five shots cracked out, fired into space. They hurt nobody. Amid the smoke, the engineer vanished; and when it had thinned away there was no trace of him. Robur the Conqueror had flown, as if some apparatus of aviation had borne him into the air.\n\nChapter V\n\nANOTHER DISAPPEARANCE\n\nThis was not the first occasion on which, at the end of their stormy discussions, the members of the Weldon Institute had filled Walnut Street and its neighborhood with their tumult. Several times had the inhabitants complained of the noisy way in which the proceedings ended, and more than once had the policemen had to interfere to clear the thoroughfare for the passersby, who for the most part were supremely indifferent on the question of aerial navigation. But never before had the tumult attained such proportions, never had the complaints been better founded, never had the intervention of the police been more necessary.\n\nBut there was some excuse for the members of the Weldon Institute. They had been attacked in their own house. To these enthusiasts for âlighter than airâ a no less enthusiast for âheavier than airâ had said things absolutely abhorrent. And at the moment they were about to treat him as he deserved, he had disappeared.\n\nSo they cried aloud for vengeance. To leave such insults unpunished was impossible to all with American blood in their veins. Had not the sons of Amerigo been called the sons of Cabot? Was not that an insult as unpardonable as it happened to be justâhistorically?\n\nThe members of the club in several groups rushed down Walnut Street, then into the adjoining streets, and then all over the neighborhood. They woke up the householders; they compelled them to search their houses, prepared to indemnify them later on for the outrage on their privacy. Vain were all their trouble and searching. Robur was nowhere to be found; there was no trace of him. He might have gone off in the âGo-Ahead.â the balloon of the Institute, for all they could tell. After an hourâs hunt the members had to give in and separate, not before they had agreed to extend their search over the whole territory of the twin Americas that form the new continent.\n\nBy eleven oâclock quiet had been restored in the neighborhood of Walnut Street. Philadelphia was able to sink again into that sound sleep which is the privilege of non-manufacturing towns. The different members of the club parted to seek their respective houses. To mention the most distinguished amongst them, William T. Forbes sought his large sugar establishment, where Miss Doll and Miss Mat had prepared for him his evening tea, sweetened with his own glucose. Truck Milnor took the road to his factory in the distant suburb, where the engines worked day and night. Treasurer Jim Chip, publicly accused of possessing an alimentary canal twelve inches longer than that of other men, returned to the vegetable soup that was waiting for him.\n\nTwo of the most important balloonistsâtwo onlyâdid not seem to think of returning so soon to their domicile. They availed themselves of the opportunity to discuss the question with more than usual acrimony. These were the irreconcilables, Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans, the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute.\n\nAt the door of the club the valet Frycollin waited for Uncle Prudent, his master, and at last he went after him, though he cared but little for the subject which had set the two colleagues at loggerheads.\n\nIt is only an euphemism that the verb âdiscussâ can be used to express the way in which the duet between the president and secretary was being performed. As a matter of fact they were in full wrangle with an energy born of their old rivalry.\n\nâNo, Sir, no.â said Phil Evans. âIf I had had the honor of being president of the Weldon Institute, there never, no, never, would have been such a scandal.â\n\nâAnd what would you have done, if you had had the honor?â demanded Uncle Prudent.\n\nâI would have stopped the insulter before he had opened his mouth.â\n\nâIt seems to me it would have been impossible to stop him until he had opened his mouth.â replied Uncle Prudent.\n\nâNot in America, Sir; not in America.â\n\nAnd exchanging such observations, increasing in bitterness as they went, they walked on through the streets farther and farther from their homes, until they reached a part of the city whence they had to go a long way round to get back.\n\nFrycollin followed, by no means at ease to see his master plunging into such deserted spots. He did not like deserted spots, particularly after midnight. In fact the darkness was profound, and the moon was only a thin crescent just beginning its monthly life. Frycollin kept a lookout to the left and right of him to see if he was followed. And he fancied he could see five or six hulking follows dogging his footsteps. Instinctively he drew nearer to his master, but not for the world would he have dared to break in on the conversation of which the fragments reached him.\n\nIn short it so chanced that the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute found themselves on the road to Fairmount Park. In the full heat of their dispute they crossed the Schuyllkill river by the famous iron bridge. They met only a few belated wayfarers, and pressed on across a wide open tract where the immense prairie was broken every now and then by the patches of thick woodlandâwhich make the park different to any other in the world.\n\nThere Frycollinâs terror became acute, particularly as he saw the five or six shadows gliding after him across the Schuyllkill bridge. The pupils of his eyes broadened out to the circumference of his iris, and his limbs seemed to diminish as if endowed with the contractility peculiar to the mollusca and certain of the articulate; for Frycollin, the valet, was an egregious coward.\n\nHe was a pure South Carolina Negro, with the head of a fool and the carcass of an imbecile. Being only one and twenty, he had never been a slave, not even by birth, but that made no difference to him. Grinning and greedy and idle, and a magnificent poltroon, he had been the servant of Uncle Prudent for about three years. Over and over again had his master threatened to kick him out, but had kept him on for fear of doing worse. With a master ever ready to venture on the most audacious enterprises, Frycollinâs cowardice had brought him many arduous trials. But he had some compensation. Very little had been said about his gluttony, and still less about his laziness.\n\nAh, Valet Frycollin, if you could only have read the future! Why, oh why, Frycollin, did you not remain at Boston with the Sneffels, and not have given them up when they talked of going to Switzerland? Was not that a much more suitable place for you than this of Uncle Prudentâs, where danger was daily welcomed?\n\nBut here he was, and his master had become used to his faults. He had one advantage, and that was a consideration. Although he was a Negro by birth he did not speak like a Negro, and nothing is so irritating as that hateful jargon in which all the pronouns are possessive and all the verbs infinitive. Let it be understood, then, that Frycollin was a thorough coward.\n\nAnd now it was midnight, and the pale crescent of the moon began to sink in the west behind the trees in the park. The rays streaming fitfully through the branches made the shadows darker than ever. Frycollin looked around him anxiously. âBrrr!â he said, âThere are those fellows there all the time. Positively they are getting nearer! Master Uncle!â he shouted.\n\nIt was thus he called the president of the Weldon Institute, and thus did the president desire to be called.\n\nAt the moment the dispute of the rivals had reached its maximum, and as they hurled their epithets at each other they walked faster and faster, and drew farther and farther away from the Schuyllkill bridge. They had reached the center of a wide clump of trees, whose summits were just tipped by the parting rays of the moon. Beyond the trees was a very large clearingâan oval field, a complete amphitheater. Not a hillock was there to hinder the gallop of the horses, not a bush to stop the view of the spectators.\n\nAnd if Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had not been so deep in their dispute, and had used their eyes as they were accustomed to, they would have found the clearing was not in its usual state. Was it a flour mill that had anchored on it during the night? It looked like it, with its wings and sailsâmotionless and mysterious in the gathering gloom.\n\nBut neither the president nor the secretary of the Weldon Institute noticed the strange modification in the landscape of Fairmount Park; and neither did Frycollin. It seemed to him that the thieves were approaching, and preparing for their attack; and he was seized with convulsive fear, paralyzed in his limbs, with every hair he could boast of on the bristle. His terror was extreme. His knees bent under him, but he had just strength enough to exclaim for the last time, âMaster Uncle! Master Uncle!â\n\nâWhat is the matter with you?â asked Uncle Prudent.\n\nPerhaps the disputants would not have been sorry to have relieved their fury at the expense of the unfortunate valet. But they had no time; and neither even had he time to answer.\n\nA whistle was heard. A flash of electric light shot across the clearing.\n\nA signal, doubtless? The moment had come for the deed of violence. In less time that it takes to tell, six men came leaping across from under the trees, two onto Uncle Prudent, two onto Phil Evans, two onto Frycollinâthere was no need for the last two, for the Negro was incapable of defending himself. The president and secretary of the Weldon Institute, although taken by surprise, would have resisted.\n\nThey had neither time nor strength to do so. In a second they were rendered speechless by a gag, blind by a bandage, thrown down, pinioned and carried bodily off across the clearing. What could they think except that they had fallen into the hands of people who intended to rob them? The people did nothing of the sort, however. They did not even touch Uncle Prudentâs pockets, although, according to his custom, they were full of paper dollars.\n\nWithin a minute of the attack, without a word being passed, Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and Frycollin felt themselves laid gently down, not on the grass, but on a sort of plank that creaked beneath them. They were laid down side by side.\n\nA door was shut; and the grating of a bolt in a staple told them that they were prisoners.\n\nThen there came a continuous buzzing, a quivering, a frrrr, with the rrr unending.\n\nAnd that was the only sound that broke the quiet of the night.\n\nGreat was the excitement next morning in Philadelphia Very early was it known what had passed at the meeting of the Institute. Everyone knew of the appearance of the mysterious engineer named RoburâRobur the Conquerorâand the tumult among the balloonists, and his inexplicable disappearance. But it was quite another thing when all the town heard that the president and secretary of the club had also disappeared during the night.\n\nLong and keen was the search in the city and neighborhood! Useless! The newspapers of Philadelphia, the newspapers of Pennsylvania, the newspapers of the United States reported the facts and explained them in a hundred ways, not one of which was the right one. Heavy rewards were offered, and placards were pasted up, but all to no purpose. The earth seemed to have opened and bodily swallowed the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute.\n\nChapter VI\n\nTHE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY SUSPEND HOSTILITIES\n\nA bandage over the eyes, a gag in the mouth, a cord round the wrists, a cord round the ankles, unable to see, to speak, or to move, Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and Frycollin were anything but pleased with their position. Knowing not who had seized them, nor in what they had been thrown like parcels in a goods wagon, nor where they were, nor what was reserved for themâit was enough to exasperate even the most patient of the ovine race, and we know that the members of the Weldon Institute were not precisely sheep as far as patience went. With his violence of character we can easily imagine how Uncle Prudent felt. One thing was evident, that Phil Evans and he would find it difficult to attend the club next evening.\n\nAs to Frycollin, with his eyes shut and his mouth closed, it was impossible for him to think of anything. He was more dead than alive.\n\nFor an hour the position of the prisoners remained unchanged. No one came to visit them, or to give them that liberty of movement and speech of which they lay in such need. They were reduced to stifled sighs, to grunts emitted over and under their gags, to everything that betrayed anger kept dumb and fury imprisoned, or rather bound down. Then after many fruitless efforts they remained for some time as though lifeless. Then as the sense of sight was denied them they tried by their sense of hearing to obtain some indication of the nature of this disquieting state of things. But in vain did they seek for any other sound than an interminable and inexplicable f-r-r-r which seemed to envelop them in a quivering atmosphere.\n\nAt last something happened. Phil Evans, regaining his coolness, managed to slacken the cord which bound his wrists. Little by little the knot slipped, his fingers slipped over each other, and his hands regained their usual freedom.\n\nA vigorous rubbing restored the circulation. A moment after he had slipped off the bandage which bound his eyes, taken the gag out of his mouth, and cut the cords round his ankles with his knife. An American who has not a bowie-knife in his pocket is no longer an American.\n\nBut if Phil Evans had regained the power of moving and speaking, that was all. His eyes were useless to himâat present at any rate. The prison was quite dark, though about six feet above him a feeble gleam of light came in through a kind of loophole.\n\nAs may be imagined, Phil Evans did not hesitate to at once set free his rival. A few cuts with the bowie settled the knots which bound him foot and hand.\n\nImmediately Uncle Prudent rose to his knees and snatched away his bandage and gag.\n\nâThanks.â said he, in stifled voice.\n\nâPhil Evans?â\n\nâUncle Prudent?â\n\nâHere we are no longer the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute. We are adversaries no more.â\n\nâYou are right.â answered Evans. âWe are now only two men agreed to avenge ourselves on a third whose attempt deserves severe reprisals. And this third isââ\n\nâRobur!â\n\nâIt is Robur!â\n\nOn this point both were absolutely in accord. On this subject there was no fear of dispute.\n\nâAnd your servant?â said Phil Evans, pointing to Frycollin, who was puffing like a grampus. âWe must set him free.â\n\nâNot yet.â said Uncle Prudent. âHe would overwhelm us with his jeremiads, and we have something else to do than abuse each other.â\n\nâWhat is that, Uncle Prudent?â\n\nâTo save ourselves if possible.â\n\nâYou are right, even if it is impossible.â\n\nâAnd even if it is impossible.â\n\nThere could be no doubt that this kidnapping was due to Robur, for an ordinary thief would have relieved them of their watches, jewelry, and purses, and thrown their bodies into the Schuyllkill with a good gash in their throats instead of throwing them to the bottom ofâOf what? That was a serious question, which would have to be answered before attempting an escape with any chance of success.\n\nâPhil Evans.â began Uncle Prudent, âif, when we came away from our meeting, instead of indulging in amenities to which we need not recur, we had kept our eyes more open, this would not have happened. Had we remained in the streets of Philadelphia there would have been none of this. Evidently Robur foresaw what would happen at the club, and had placed some of his bandits on guard at the door. When we left Walnut Street these fellows must have watched us and followed us, and when we imprudently ventured into Fairmount Park they went in for their little game.â\n\nâAgreed.â said Evans. âWe were wrong not to go straight home.â\n\nâIt is always wrong not to be right.â said Prudent.\n\nHere a long-drawn sigh escaped from the darkest corner of the prison. âWhat is that?â asked Evans.\n\nâNothing! Frycollin is dreaming.â\n\nâBetween the moment we were seized a few steps out into the clearing and the moment we were thrown in here only two minutes elapsed. It is thus evident that those people did not take us out of Fairmount Park.â\n\nâAnd if they had done so we should have felt we were being moved.â\n\nâUndoubtedly; and consequently we must be in some vehicle, perhaps some of those long prairie wagons, or some show-caravanââ\n\nâEvidently! For if we were in a boat moored on the Schuyllkill we should have noticed the movement due to the currentââ\n\nâThat is so; and as we are still in the clearing, I think that now is the time to get away, and we can return later to settle with this Roburââ\n\nâAnd make him pay for this attempt on the liberty of two citizens of the United States.â\n\nâAnd he shall pay pretty dearly!â\n\nâBut who is this man? Where does he come from? Is he English, or German, or Frenchââ\n\nâHe is a scoundrel, that is enough!â said Uncle Prudent. âNow to work.â And then the two men, with their hands stretched out and their fingers wide apart, began to feel round the walls to find a joint or crack.\n\nNothing. Nothing; not even at the door. It was closely shut and it was impossible to shoot back the lock. All that could be done was to make a hole, and escape through the hole. It remained to be seen if the knives could cut into the walls.\n\nâBut whence comes this never-ending rustling?â asked Evans, who was much impressed at the continuous f-r-r-r.\n\nâThe wind, doubtless.â said Uncle Prudent.\n\nâThe wind! But I thought the night was quite calm.â\n\nâSo it was. But if it isnât the wind, what can it be?â\n\nPhil Evans got out the best blade of his knife and set to work on the wall near the door. Perhaps he might make a hole which would enable him to open it from the outside should it be only bolted or should the key have been left in the lock. He worked away for some minutes. The only result was to nip up his knife, to snip off its point, and transform what was left of the blade into a saw.\n\nâDoesnât it cut?â asked Uncle Prudent.\n\nâNo.â\n\nâIs the wall made of sheet iron?â\n\nâNo; it gives no metallic sound when you hit it.â\n\nâIs it of ironwood?â\n\nâNo; it isnât iron and it isnât wood.â\n\nâWhat is it then?â\n\nâImpossible to say. But, anyhow, steel doesnât touch it.â Uncle Prudent, in a sudden outburst of fury, began to rave and stamp on the sonorous planks, while his hands sought to strangle an imaginary Robur.\n\nâBe calm, Prudent, be calm! You have a try.â\n\nUncle Prudent had a try, but the bowie-knife could do nothing against a wall which its best blades could not even scratch. The wall seemed to be made of crystal.\n\nSo it became evident that all flight was impracticable except through the door, and for a time they must resign themselves to their fateânot a very pleasant thing for the Yankee temperament, and very much to the disgust of these eminently practical men. But this conclusion was not arrived at without many objurgations and loud-sounding phrases hurled at this Roburâwho, from what had been seen of him at the Weldon Institute, was not the sort of man to trouble himself much about them.\n\nSuddenly Frycollin began to give unequivocal signs of being unwell. He began to writhe in a most lamentable fashion, either with cramp in his stomach or in his limbs; and Uncle Prudent, thinking it his duty to put an end to these gymnastics, cut the cords that bound him.\n\nHe had cause to be sorry for it. Immediately there was poured forth an interminable litany, in which the terrors of fear were mingled with the tortures of hunger. Frycollin was no worse in his brain than in his stomach, and it would have been difficult to decide to which organ the chief cause of the trouble should be assigned.\n\nâFrycollin!â said Uncle Prudent.\n\nâMaster Uncle! Master Uncle!â answered the Negro between two of his lugubrious howls.\n\nâIt is possible that we are doomed to die of hunger in this prison, but we have made up our minds not to succumb until we have availed ourselves of every means of alimentation to prolong our lives.â\n\nâTo eat me?â exclaimed Frycollin.\n\nâAs is always done with a Negro under such circumstances! So you had better not make yourself too obviousââ\n\nâOr youâll have your bones picked!â said Evans.\n\nAnd as Frycollin saw he might be used to prolong two existences more precious than his own, he contented himself thenceforth with groaning in quiet.\n\nThe time went on and all attempts to force the door or get through the wall proved fruitless. What the wall was made of was impossible to say. It was not metal; it was not wood; it was not stone, And all the cell seemed to be made of the same stuff. When they stamped on the floor it gave a peculiar sound that Uncle Prudent found it difficult to describe; the floor seemed to sound hollow, as if it was not resting directly on the ground of the clearing. And the inexplicable f-r-r-r-r seemed to sweep along below it. All of which was rather alarming.\n\nâUncle Prudent.â said Phil Evans.\n\nâWell?â\n\nâDo you think our prison has been moved at all?â\n\nâNot that I know of.â\n\nâBecause when we were first caught I distinctly remember the fresh fragrance of the grass and the resinous odor of the park trees. While now, when I take in a good sniff of the air, it seems as though all that had gone.â\n\nâSo it has.â\n\nâWhy?â\n\nâWe cannot say why unless we admit that the prison has moved; and I say again that if the prison had moved, either as a vehicle on the road or a boat on the stream, we should have felt it.â\n\nHere Frycollin gave vent to a long groan, which might have been taken for his last had he not followed it up with several more.\n\nâI expect Robur will soon have us brought before him.â said Phil Evans.\n\nâI hope so.â said Uncle Prudent. âAnd I shall tell himââ\n\nâWhat?â\n\nâThat he began by being rude and ended in being unbearable.â\n\nHere Phil Evans noticed that day was beginning to break. A gleam, still faint, filtered through the narrow window opposite the door. It ought thus to be about four oâclock in the morning for it is at that hour in the month of June in this latitude that the horizon of Philadelphia is tinged by the first rays of the dawn.\n\nBut when Uncle Prudent sounded his repeaterâwhich was a masterpiece from his colleagueâs factoryâthe tiny gong only gave a quarter to three, and the watch had not stopped.\n\nâThat is strange!â said Phil Evans. âAt a quarter to three it ought still to be night.â\n\nâPerhaps my watch has got slow.â answered Uncle Prudent.\n\nâA watch of the Wheelton Watch Company!â exclaimed Phil Evans.\n\nWhatever might be the reason, there was no doubt that the day was breaking. Gradually the window became white in the deep darkness of the cell. However, if the dawn appeared sooner than the fortieth parallel permitted, it did not advance with the rapidity peculiar to lower latitudes. This was another observationâof Uncle Prudentâsâa new inexplicable phenomenon.\n\nâCouldnât we get up to the window and see where we are?â\n\nâWe might.â said Uncle Prudent. âFrycollin, get up!â\n\nThe Negro arose.\n\nâPut your back against the wall.â continued Prudent, âand you, Evans, get on his shoulders while I buttress him up.â\n\nâRight!â said Evans.\n\nAn instant afterwards his knees were on Frycollinâs shoulders, and his eyes were level with the window. The window was not of lenticular glass like those on shipboard, but was a simple flat pane. It was small, and Phil Evans found his range of view was much limited.\n\nâBreak the glass.â said Prudent, âand perhaps you will be able to see better.â\n\nPhil Evans gave it a sharp knock with the handle of his bowie-knife. It gave back a silvery sound, but it did not break.\n\nAnother and more violent blow. The same result.\n\nâIt is unbreakable glass!â said Evans.\n\nIt appeared as though the pane was made of glass toughened on the Siemens systemâas after several blows it remained intact.\n\nThe light had now increased, and Phil Evans could see for some distance within the radius allowed by the frame.\n\nâWhat do you see?â asked Uncle Prudent.\n\nâNothing.â\n\nâWhat? Not any trees?â\n\nâNo.â\n\nâNot even the top branches?â\n\nâNo.â\n\nâThen we are not in the clearing?â\n\nâNeither in the clearing nor in the park.â\n\nâDonât you see any roofs of houses or monuments?â said Prudent, whose disappointment and anger were increasing rapidly.\n\nâNo.â\n\nâWhat! Not a flagstaff, nor a church tower, nor a chimney?â\n\nâNothing but space.â\n\nAs he uttered the words the door opened. A man appeared on the threshold. It was Robur.\n\nâHonorable balloonistsâ he said, in a serious voice, âyou are now free to go and come as you like.â\n\nâFree!â exclaimed Uncle Prudent.\n\nâYesâwithin the limits of the âAlbatross!â\n\nUncle Prudent and Phil Evans rushed out of their prison. And what did they see?\n\nFour thousand feet below them the face of a country they sought in vain to recognize.\n\nChapter VII\n\nON BOARD THE ALBATROSS\n\nâWhen will man cease to crawl in the depths to live in the azure and quiet of the sky?â\n\nTo this question of Camille Flammarionâs the answer is easy. It will be when the progress of mechanics has enabled us to solve the problem of aviation. And in a few yearsâas we can foreseeâa more practical utilization of electricity will do much towards that solution.\n\nIn 1783, before the Montgolfier brothers had built their fire-balloon, and Charles, the physician, had devised his first aerostat, a few adventurous spirits had dreamt of the conquest of space by mechanical means. The first inventors did not think of apparatus lighter than air, for that the science of their time did not allow them to imagine. It was to contrivances heavier than air, to flying machines in imitation of the birds, that they trusted to realize aerial locomotion.\n\nThis was exactly what had been done by that madman Icarus, the son of Daedalus, whose wings, fixed together with wax, had melted as they approached the sun.\n\nBut without going back to mythological times, without dwelling on Archytas of Tarentum, we find, in the works of Dante of Perugia, of Leonardo da Vinci and Guidotti, the idea of machines made to move through the air. Two centuries and a half afterwards inventors began to multiply. In 1742 the Marquis de Bacqueville designed a system of wings, tried it over the Seine, and fell and broke his arm. In 1768 Paucton conceived the idea of an apparatus with two screws, suspensive and propulsive. In 1781 Meerwein, the architect of the Prince of Baden, built an orthopteric machine, and protested against the tendency of the aerostats which had just been invented. In 1784 Launoy and Bienvenu had maneuvered a helicopter worked by springs. In 1808 there were the attempts at flight by the Austrian Jacques Degen. In 1810 came the pamphlet by Denian of Nantes, in which the principles of âheavier than airâ are laid down. From 1811 to 1840 came the inventions and researches of Derblinger, Vigual, Sarti, Dubochet, and Cagniard de Latour. In 1842 we have the Englishman Henson, with his system of inclined planes and screws worked by steam. In 1845 came Cossus and his ascensional screws. In 1847 came Camille Vert and his helicopter made of birdsâ wings. In 1852 came Letur with his system of guidable parachutes, whose trial cost him his life; and in the same year came Michel Loup with his plan of gliding through the air on four revolving wings. In 1853 came BÃ©lÃ©guic and his aeroplane with the traction screws, Vaussin-Chardannes with his guidable kite, and George Cauley with his flying machines driven by gas. From 1854 to 1863 appeared Joseph Pline with several patents for aerial systems. BrÃ©ant, Carlingford, Le Bris, Du Temple, Bright, whose ascensional screws were left-handed; Smythies, Panafieu, Crosnier, &c. At length, in 1863, thanks to the efforts of Nadar, a society of âheavier than airâ was founded in Paris. There the inventors could experiment with the machines, of which many were patented. Ponton dâAmÃ©court and his steam helicopter, La Landelle and his system of combining screws with inclined planes and parachutes, LouvriÃ© and his aeroscape, Esterno and his mechanical bird, Groof and his apparatus with wings worked by levers. The impetus was given, inventors invented, calculators calculated all that could render aerial locomotion practicable. Bourcart, Le Bris, Kaufmann, Smyth, Stringfellow, Prigent, Danjard, PomÃ©s and De la Pauze, Moy, PÃ©naud, Jobert, Haureau de Villeneuve, Achenbach, Garapon, Duchesne, Danduran, Pariesel, Dieuaide, Melkiseff, Forlanini, Bearey, Tatin, Dandrieux, Edison, some with wings or screws, others with inclined planes, imagined, created, constructed, perfected, their flying machines, ready to do their work, once there came to be applied to thereby some inventor a motor of adequate power and excessive lightness.\n\nThis list may be a little long, but that will be forgiven, for it is necessary to give the various steps in the ladder of aerial locomotion, on the top of which appeared Robur the Conqueror. Without these attempts, these experiments of his predecessors, how could the inquirer have conceived so perfect an apparatus? And though he had but contempt for those who obstinately worked away in the direction of balloons, he held in high esteem all those partisans of âheavier than air.â English, American, Italian, Austrian, Frenchâand particularly Frenchâwhose work had been perfected by him, and led him to design and then to build this flying engine known as the âAlbatross.â which he was guiding through the currents of the atmosphere.\n\nâThe pigeon flies!â had exclaimed one of the most persistent adepts at aviation.\n\nâThey will crowd the air as they crowd the earth!â said one of his most excited partisans.\n\nâFrom the locomotive to the aeromotive!â shouted the noisiest of all, who had turned on the trumpet of publicity to awaken the Old and New Worlds.\n\nNothing, in fact, is better established, by experiment and calculation, than that the air is highly resistant. A circumference of only a yard in diameter in the shape of a parachute can not only impede descent in air, but can render it isochronous. That is a fact.\n\nIt is equally well known that when the speed is great the work of the weight varies in almost inverse ratio to the square of the speed, and therefore becomes almost insignificant.\n\nIt is also known that as the weight of a flying animal increases, the less is the proportional increase in the surface beaten by the wings in order to sustain it, although the motion of the wings becomes slower.\n\nA flying machine must therefore be constructed to take advantage of these natural laws, to imitate the bird, âthat admirable type of aerial locomotion.â according to Dr. Marcy, of the Institute of France.\n\nIn short the contrivances likely to solve the problem are of three kinds:â\n\n1. Helicopters or spiralifers, which are simply screws with vertical axes.\n\n2. Ornithopters, machines which endeavour to reproduce the natural flight of birds.\n\n3. Aeroplanes, which are merely inclined planes like kites, but towed or driven by screws.\n\nEach of these systems has had and still has it partisans obstinately resolved to give way in not the slightest particular. However, Robur, for many reasons, had rejected the two first.\n\nThe ornithopter, or mechanical bird, offers certain advantages, no doubt. That the work and experiments of M. Renard in 1884 have sufficiently proved. But, as has been said, it is not necessary to copy Nature servilely. Locomotives are not copied from the hare, nor are ships copied from the fish. To the first we have put wheels which are not legs; to the second we have put screws which are not fins. And they do not do so badly. Besides, what is this mechanical movement in the flight of birds, whose action is so complex? Has not Doctor Marcy suspected that the feathers open during the return of the wings so as to let the air through them? And is not that rather a difficult operation for an artificial machine?\n\nOn the other hand, aeroplanes have given many good results. Screws opposing a slanting plane to the bed of air will produce an ascensional movement, and the models experimented on have shown that the disposable weight, that is to say the weight it is possible to deal with as distinct from that of the apparatus, increases with the square of the speed. Herein the aeroplane has the advantage over the aerostat even when the aerostat is furnished with the means of locomotion.\n\nNevertheless Robur had thought that the simpler his contrivance the better. And the screwsâthe Saint Helices that had been thrown in his teeth at the Weldon Instituteâhad sufficed for all the needs of his flying machine. One series could hold it suspended in the air, the other could drive it along under conditions that were marvelously adapted for speed and safety.\n\nIf the ornithopterâstriking like the wings of a birdâraised itself by beating the air, the helicopter raised itself by striking the air obliquely, with the fins of the screw as it mounted on an inclined plane. These fins, or arms, are in reality wings, but wings disposed as a helix instead of as a paddle wheel. The helix advances in the direction of its axis. Is the axis vertical? Then it moves vertically. Is the axis horizontal? Then it moves horizontally.\n\nThe whole of Roburâs flying apparatus depended on these two movements, as will be seen from the following detailed description, which can be divided under three headsâthe platform, the engines of suspension and propulsion, and the machinery.\n\nPlatform.âThis was a framework a hundred feet long and twelve wide, a shipâs deck in fact, with a projecting prow. Beneath was a hull solidly built, enclosing the engines, stores, and provisions of all sorts, including the watertanks. Round the deck a few light uprights supported a wire trellis that did duty for bulwarks. On the deck were three houses, whose compartments were used as cabins for the crew, or as machine rooms. In the center house was the machine which drove the suspensory helices, in that forward was the machine that drove the bow screw, in that aft was the machine that drove the stern screw. In the bow were the cookâs galley and the crewâs quarters; in the stern were several cabins, including that of the engineer, the saloon, and above them all a glass house in which stood the helmsman, who steered the vessel by means of a powerful rudder. All these cabins were lighted by port-holes filled with toughened glass, which has ten times the resistance of ordinary glass. Beneath the hull was a system of flexible springs to ease off the concussion when it became advisable to land.\n\nEngines of suspension and propulsion.âAbove the deck rose thirty-seven vertical axes, fifteen along each side, and seven, more elevated, in the centre. The âAlbatrossâ might be called a clipper with thirty-seven masts. But these masts instead of sails bore each two horizontal screws, not very large in spread or diameter, but driven at prodigious speed. Each of these axes had its own movement independent of the rest, and each alternate one spun round in a different direction from the others, so as to avoid any tendency to gyration. Hence the screws as they rose on the vertical column of air retained their equilibrium by their horizontal resistance. Consequently the apparatus was furnished with seventy-four suspensory screws, whose three branches were connected by a metallic circle which economized their motive force. In front and behind, mounted on horizontal axes, were two propelling screws, each with four arms. These screws were of much larger diameter than the suspensory ones, but could be worked at quite their speed. In fact, the vessel combined the systems of Cossus, La Landelle, and Ponton dâAmÃ©court, as perfected by Robur. But it was in the choice and application of his motive force that he could claim to be an inventor.\n\nMachinery.âRobur had not availed himself of the vapor of water or other liquids, nor compressed air and other mechanical motion. He employed electricity, that agent which one day will be the soul of the industrial world. But he required no electro-motor to produce it. All he trusted to was piles and accumulators. What were the elements of these piles, and what were the acids he used, Robur only knew. And the construction of the accumulators was kept equally secret. Of what were their positive and negative plates? None can say. The engineer took good careâand not unreasonablyâto keep his secret unpatented. One thing was unmistakable, and that was that the piles were of extraordinary strength; and the accumulators left those of Faure-Sellon-Volckmar very far behind in yielding currents whose ampÃ¨res ran into figures up to then unknown. Thus there was obtained a power to drive the screws and communicate a suspending and propelling force in excess of all his requirements under any circumstances.\n\nButâit is as well to repeat itâthis belonged entirely to Robur. He kept it a close secret. And, if the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute did not happen to discover it, it would probably be lost to humanity.\n\nIt need not be shown that the apparatus possessed sufficient stability. Its center of gravity proved that at once. There was no danger of its making alarming angles with the horizontal, still less of its capsizing.\n\nAnd now for the metal used by Robur in the construction of his aeronefâa name which can be exactly applied to the âAlbatross.â What was this material, so hard that the bowie-knife of Phil Evans could not scratch it, and Uncle Prudent could not explain its nature? Simply paper!\n\nFor some years this fabrication had been making considerable progress. Unsized paper, with the sheets impregnated with dextrin and starch and squeezed in hydraulic presses, will form a material as hard as steel. There are made of it pulleys, rails, and wagon-wheels, much more solid than metal wheels, and far lighter. And it was this lightness and solidity which Robur availed himself of in building his aerial locomotive. Everythingâframework, hull, houses, cabinsâwere made of straw-paper turned hard as metal by compression, andâwhat was not to be despised in an apparatus flying at great heightsâincombustible. The different parts of the engines and the screws were made of gelatinized fiber, which combined in sufficient degree flexibility with resistance. This material could be used in every form. It was insoluble in most gases and liquids, acids or essences, to say nothing of its insulating properties, and it proved most valuable in the electric machinery of the âAlbatross.â\n\nRobur, his mate Tom Turner, an engineer and two assistants, two steersman and a cookâeight men all toldâformed the crew of the aeronef, and proved ample for all the maneuvers required in aerial navigation. There were arms of the chase and of war; fishing appliances; electric lights; instruments of observation, compasses, and sextants for checking the course, thermometers for studying the temperature, different barometers, some for estimating the heights attained, others for indicating the variations of atmospheric pressure; a storm-glass for forecasting tempests; a small library; a portable printing press; a field-piece mounted on a pivot; breech loading and throwing a three-inch shell; a supply of powder, bullets, dynamite cartridges; a cooking-stove, warmed by currents from the accumulators; a stock of preserves, meats and vegetables sufficient to last for months. Such were the outfit and stores of the aeronefâin addition to the famous trumpet.\n\nThere was besides a light india-rubber boat, insubmersible, which could carry eight men on the surface of a river, a lake, or a calm sea.\n\nBut were there any parachutes in case of accident? No. Robur did not believe in accidents of that kind. The axes of the screws were independent. The stoppage of a few would not affect the motion of the others; and if only half were working, the âAlbatrossâ could still keep afloat in her natural element.\n\nâAnd with her.â said Robur to his guestsâguests in spite of themselvesââI am master of the seventh part of the world, larger than Africa, Oceania, Asia, America, and Europe, this aerial Icarian sea, which millions of Icarians will one day people.â\n\nChapter VIII\n\nTHE BALLOONISTS REFUSE TO BE CONVINCED\n\nThe President of the Weldon Institute was stupefied; his companion was astonished. But neither of them would allow any of their very natural amazement to be visible.\n\nThe valet Frycollin did not conceal his terror at finding himself borne through space on such a machine, and he took no pains whatever to hide it.\n\nThe suspensory screws were rapidly spinning overhead. Fast as they were going, they would have to triple their speed if the âAlbatrossâ was to ascend to higher zones. The two propellers were running very easily and driving the ship at about eleven knots an hour.\n\nAs they leaned over the rail the passengers of the âAlbatrossâ could perceive a long sinuous liquid ribbon which meandered like a mere brook through a varied country amid the gleaming of many lagoons obliquely struck by the rays of the sun. The brook was a river, one of the most important in that district. Along its left bank was a chain of mountains extending out of sight.\n\nâAnd will you tell us where we are?â asked Uncle Prudent, in a voice tremulous with anger.\n\nâI have nothing to teach you.â answered Robur.\n\nâAnd will you tell us where we are going?â asked Phil Evans.\n\nâThrough space.â\n\nâAnd how long will that last?â\n\nâUntil it ends.â\n\nâAre we going round the world?â asked Phil Evans ironically.\n\nâFurther than that.â said Robur.\n\nâAnd if this voyage does not suit us?â asked Uncle Prudent.\n\nâIt will have to suit you.â\n\nThat is a foretaste of the nature of the relations that were to obtain between the master of the âAlbatrossâ and his guests, not to say his prisoners. Manifestly he wished to give them time to cool down, to admire the marvelous apparatus which was bearing them through the air, and doubtless to compliment the inventor. And so he went off to the other end of the deck, leaving them to examine the arrangement of the machinery and the management of the ship or to give their whole attention to the landscape which was unrolling beneath them.\n\nâUncle Prudent.â said Evans, âunless I am mistaken we are flying over Central Canada. That river in the northwest is the St. Lawrence. That town we are leaving behind is Quebec.â\n\nIt was indeed the old city of Champlain, whose zinc roofs were shining like reflectors in the sun. The âAlbatrossâ must thus have reached the forty-sixth degree of north latitude, and thus was explained the premature advance of the day with the abnormal prolongation of the dawn.\n\nâYes.â said Phil Evans, âThere is the town in its amphitheater, the hill with its citadel, the Gibraltar of North America. There are the cathedrals. There is the Custom House with its dome surmounted by the British flag!â\n\nPhil Evans had not finished before the Canadian city began to slip into the distance.\n\nThe clipper entered a zone of light clouds, which gradually shut off a view of the ground.\n\nRobur, seeing that the president and secretary of the Weldon Institute had directed their attention to the external arrangements of the âAlbatross.â walked up to them and said: âWell, gentlemen, do you believe in the possibility of aerial locomotion by machines heavier than air?â\n\nIt would have been difficult not to succumb to the evidence. But Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans did not reply.\n\nâYou are silent.â continued the engineer. âDoubtless hunger makes you dumb! But if I undertook to carry you through the air, I did not think of feeding you on such a poorly nutritive fluid. Your first breakfast is waiting for you.â\n\nAs Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were feeling the pangs of hunger somewhat keenly they did not care to stand upon ceremony. A meal would commit them to nothing; and when Robur put them back on the ground they could resume full liberty of action.\n\nAnd so they followed into a small dining-room in the aftermost house. There they found a well-laid table at which they could take their meals during the voyage. There were different preserves; and, among other things, was a sort of bread made of equal parts of flour and meat reduced to powder and worked together with a little lard, which boiled in water made excellent soup; and there were rashers of fried ham, and for drink there was tea.\n\nNeither had Frycollin been forgotten. He was taken forward and there found some strong soup made of this bread. In truth he had to be very hungry to eat at all, for his jaws shook with fear, and almost refused to work. âIf it was to break! If it was to break!â said the unfortunate Negro. Hence continual faintings. Only think! A fall of over four thousand feet, which would smash him to a jelly!\n\nAn hour afterwards Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans appeared on the deck. Robur was no longer there. At the stem the man at the wheel in his glass cage, his eyes fixed on the compass, followed imperturbably without hesitation the route given by the engineer.\n\nAs for the rest of the crew, breakfast probably kept them from their posts. An assistant engineer, examining the machinery, went from one house to the other.\n\nIf the speed of the ship was great the two colleagues could only estimate it imperfectly, for the âAlbatrossâ had passed through the cloud zone which the sun showed some four thousand feet below.\n\nâI can hardly believe it.â said Phil Evans.\n\nâDonât believe it!â said Uncle Prudent. And going to the bow they looked out towards the western horizon.\n\nâAnother town.â said Phil Evans.\n\nâDo you recognize it?â\n\nâYes! It seems to me to be Montreal.â\n\nâMontreal? But we only left Quebec two hours ago!â\n\nâThat proves that we must be going at a speed of seventy-five miles an hour.â\n\nSuch was the speed of the aeronef; and if the passengers were not inconvenienced by it, it was because they were going with the wind. In a calm such speed would have been difficult and the rate would have sunk to that of an express. In a head-wind the speed would have been unbearable.\n\nPhil Evans was not mistaken. Below the âAlbatrossâ appeared Montreal, easily recognizable by the Victoria Bridge, a tubular bridge thrown over the St. Lawrence like the railway viaduct over the Venice lagoon. Soon they could distinguish the townâs wide streets, its huge shops, its palatial banks, its cathedral, recently built on the model of St. Peterâs at Rome, and then Mount Royal, which commands the city and forms a magnificent park.\n\nLuckily Phil Evans had visited the chief towns of Canada, and could recognize them without asking Robur. After Montreal they passed Ottawa, whose falls, seen from above, looked like a vast cauldron in ebullition, throwing off masses of steam with grand effect.\n\nâThere is the Parliament House.â\n\nAnd he pointed out a sort of Nuremburg toy planted on a hill top. This toy with its polychrome architecture resembled the House of Parliament in London much as the Montreal cathedral resembles St. Peterâs at Rome. But that was of no consequence; there could be no doubt it was Ottawa.\n\nSoon the city faded off towards the horizon, and formed but a luminous spot on the ground.\n\nIt was almost two hours before Robur appeared. His mate, Tom Turner, accompanied him. He said only three words. These were transmitted to the two assistant engineers in the fore and aft engine-houses. At a sign the helmsman changed the-direction of the âAlbatrossâ a couple of points to the southwest; at the same time Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans felt that a greater speed had been given to the propellers.\n\nIn fact, the speed had been doubled, and now surpassed anything that had ever been attained by terrestrial Engines. Torpedo-boats do their twenty-two knots an hour; railway trains do their sixty miles an hour; the ice-boats on the frozen Hudson do their sixty-five miles an hour; a machine built by the Patterson company, with a cogged wheel, has done its eighty miles; and another locomotive between Trenton and Jersey City has done its eighty-four.\n\nBut the âAlbatross.â at full speed, could do her hundred and twenty miles an hour, or 176 feet per second. This speed is that of the storm which tears up trees by the roots. It is the mean speed of the carrier pigeon, and is only surpassed by the flight of the swallow (220 feet per second) and that of the swift (274 feet per second).\n\nIn a word, as Robur had said, the âAlbatross.â by using the whole force of her screws, could make the tour of the globe in two hundred hours, or less than eight days.\n\nIs it necessary to say so? The phenomenon whose appearance had so much puzzled the people of both worlds was the aeronef of the engineer. The trumpet which blared its startling fanfares through the air was that of the mate, Tom Turner. The flag planted on the chief monuments of Europe, Asia, America, was the flag of Robur the Conqueror and his âAlbatross.â\n\nAnd if up to then the engineer had taken many precautions against being recognized, if by preference he traveled at night, clearing the way with his electric lights, and during the day vanishing into the zones above the clouds, he seemed now to have no wish to keep his secret hidden. And if he had come to Philadelphia and presented himself at the meeting of the Weldon Institute, was it not that they might share in his prodigious discovery, and convince âipso factoâ the most incredulous? We know how he had been received, and we see what reprisals he had taken on the president and secretary of the club.\n\nAgain did Robur approach his prisoners, who affected to be in no way surprised at what they saw, of what had succeeded in spite of them. Evidently beneath the cranium of these two Anglo-Saxon heads there was a thick crust of obstinacy, which would not be easy to remove.\n\nOn his part, Robur did not seem to notice anything particular, and coolly continued the conversation which he had begun two hours before.\n\nâGentlemen.â said he, âyou ask yourselves doubtless if this apparatus, so marvelously adapted for aerial locomotion, is susceptible of receiving greater speed. It is not worth while to conquer space if we cannot devour it. I wanted the air to be a solid support to me, and it is. I saw that to struggle against the wind I must be stronger than the wind, and I am. I had no need of sails to drive me, nor oars nor wheels to push me, nor rails to give me a faster road. Air is what I wanted, that was all. Air surrounds me as it surrounds the submarine boat, and in it my propellers act like the screws of a steamer. That is how I solved the problem of aviation. That is what a balloon will never do, nor will any machine that is lighter than air.â\n\nSilence, absolute, on the part of the colleagues, which did not for a moment disconcert the engineer. He contented himself with a half-smile, and continued in his interrogative style, âPerhaps you ask if to this power of the âAlbatrossâ to move horizontally there is added an equal power of vertical movementâin a word, if, when, we visit the higher zones of the atmosphere, we can compete with an aerostat? Well, I should not advise you to enter the âGo-Aheadâ against her!â\n\nThe two colleagues shrugged their shoulders. That was probably"
