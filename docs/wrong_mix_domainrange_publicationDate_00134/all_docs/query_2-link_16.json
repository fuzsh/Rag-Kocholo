        "text": "So I fell in love with this scent and I don’t care that it is a scent for a man. I wear ( as a woman) because it smells amazing.\n\nFound it interesting that it is labelled a masculine perfume. Me, a women, like it very much. Its very refreshing and the heart/base notes are quite soft and sweet. Not domineering like I know some “masculine” perfumes to be.\n\nI loved this particular one because of its fresh citrusy scent. It was my perfect summer scent last year and I received constant compliments. However, this is my 2nd bottle and for some reason it isn't as potent as the first one. The scent seems to be less intense, which I am not a fan of. I know it is supposed to be the same scent, not sure why that is. I still love it.\n\nI loved this particular one because of its fresh citrusy scent. It was my perfect summer scent last year and I received constant compliments.
