        "text": "This study delves into the intricate relationship between European cinema and Hollywood, analyzing the geopolitical, technological, and cultural factors shaping their dynamic. The American film industry's pervasive influence, seen as hegemonic, has spurred a counteractive European response, primarily guided by French leadership. Notably, Hollywood's presence in European cinemas catalyzed a sense of urgency for European nations to appreciate the importance of cultural interconnectedness through film co-productions. The research method employs a multifaceted approach combining historical, content, and comparative analyses, focusing on pivotal moments such as the Cold War's end, the Iron Curtain's fall, and the rise of on-demand media platforms. The study highlights Europe's struggle to strike a balance between economic aspirations and the promotion of fundamental values in audiovisual works. The conclusion suggests Europe's need to transition from preserving to proactively promoting cultural values, with an emphasis on embracing diversity and eliminating disparities in national approaches. Keywords: audiovisual, cinema, Europeanism, Hollywood, geopolitical dynamics, cultural diversity, on-demand media platforms, policy, technological influence.\n\nExtract from Edinburgh University Press containing the table of contents and full introduction. Abstract: Twenty-five years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism in Eastern Europe, and ten years have passed since the first formerly communist states entered the E.U. An entire post-Wall generation has now entered adulthood, yet scholarship on European cinema still tends to divide the continent along the old Cold War lines. In East West and Centre the world's leading scholars in the field assemble to consider the ways in which notions such as East and West, national and transnational, central and marginal are being rethought and reframed in contemporary European cinema. Assessing the state of post-1989 European cinema, from (co)production and reception trends to filmic depictions of migration patterns, economic transformations and socio-political debates over the past and the present, they address increasingly intertwined cinema industries that are both central (France and Germany) and marginal in Europe (Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania)."
