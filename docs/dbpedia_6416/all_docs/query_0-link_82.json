        "text": "You can read more about this year in film here. The Best Picture race is discussed here, with reviews of all the nominees. First there are the categories, followed by all the films with their nominations, then the Globes, where I split the major awards by Drama and Comedy, followed by a few lists at the very end. If there’s a film you expected to see and didn’t, check the very bottom – it might be eligible in a different year. Films in red won the Oscar in that category (or Globe, in the Globes section). Films in blue were nominated. Films with an asterisk (*) were Consensus nominees (a scale I put together based on the various awards) while those with a double asterisk (**) were the Consensus winners. Anything in olive is a link to another post that I didn’t want to show up accidentally in blue and make it appear like it’s a nominee.\n\nI’m listing the top 8 in the categories but only the top 5 earn Nighthawk nominations. The reason I have dropped it to 8 is because there is often a big drop between #8 and #9 and a lot of categories don’t even go past 8.\n\nNighthawk Awards:\n\nBest Picture\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nGallipoli\n\nReds\n\nAtlantic City\n\nExcalibur\n\nRagtime\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\n\nBody Heat\n\nAnalysis: My Top 5 are easy, as there are only five **** films for the first time since 1972 and the last time to-date. The drop between #5 and #6 (four points) is the largest since 1972 and the second largest since 1957.\n\nBest Director\n\nSteven Spielberg (Raiders of the Lost Ark) *\n\nPeter Weir (Gallipoli)\n\nWarren Beatty (Reds) **\n\nJohn Boorman (Excalibur)\n\nLouis Malle (Atlantic City) *\n\nLawrence Kasdan (Body Heat)\n\nMilos Forman (Ragtime)\n\nKarel Reisz (The French Lieutenant’s Woman)\n\nAnalysis: These are the only nominations for Beatty and Malle, which is a little surprising. It’s the second nominations for Weir and Boorman. Spielberg, on the other hand, earns his third nomination and second win.\n\nWith Beatty winning while Chariots wins Best Picture, this is the fourth time (joining 1936, 1937 and 1951) that the Picture winner doesn’t make my Top 10 (Chariots is my #19) while the Director winner is in my Top 5. With Best Director nominations for Hugh Hudson (Chariots) and Mark Rydell (On Golden Pond), the Oscar score is only a 60.5, the lowest in the category since 1968.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman *\n\nRagtime *\n\nExcalibur\n\nBuddy Buddy\n\nThe Lady from Musashino\n\nSuperman II\n\nAnalysis: On Golden Pond was the easy Consensus winner (Oscar, WGA, Globe wins, BAFTA nom) but I think it’s sentimental and trite and doesn’t deserve accolades for its writing.\n\nBilly Wilder earns his 17th and final Nighthawk nomination, finishing with 1000 points exactly and in 1st place (until Bergman ties him in 1983 and passes him in 1984).\n\nThe weakest Top 5 in four years, but the second weakest since 1942.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nAtlantic City **\n\nReds *\n\nGallipoli\n\nAbsence of Malice *\n\nBody Heat\n\nMy Dinner with Andre\n\nThe Last Metro\n\nAnalysis: Atlantic City would lose the Oscar to Chariots of Fire (my #9), the WGA to Reds, the BAFTA to Gregory’s Girl and the Nighthawk to Raiders, but won three critics awards (NYFC, LAFC, NSFC). If it had been in 1980 or 1982, it would have won the Nighthawk.\n\nLawrence Kasdan earns his second nomination and first win for Raiders, while just missing out for Body Heat.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nWarren Beatty (Reds) *\n\nBurt Lancaster (Atlantic City) **\n\nHarrison Ford (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\nPaul Newman (Absence of Malice) *\n\nJeremy Irons (The French Lieutenant’s Woman) *\n\nHenry Fonda (On Golden Pond) *\n\nMel Gibson (Gallipoli)\n\nWilliam Hurt (Body Heat)\n\nAnalysis: Lancaster has the highest Consensus total (399 points) to-date and the fourth highest in history for someone who doesn’t win the Oscar. He win the NYFC, LAFC, NSFC, BSFC and BAFTA and earns Oscar and Globe noms.\n\nThese are the first nominations for Ford and Irons. It’s the sixth, and final, nomination for Lancaster, who, sadly never wins a Nighthawk but finishes in second twice. It’s the fifth nomination and second win for Beatty. It’s also the fifth nomination for Newman.\n\nBest Actress\n\nDiane Keaton (Reds) *\n\nMeryl Streep (The French Lieutenant’s Woman) **\n\nKaren Allen (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\nKathleen Turner (Body Heat)\n\nSusan Sarandon (Atlantic City)\n\nCatherine Deneuve (The Last Metro)\n\nSally Field (Absence of Malice)\n\nKatharine Hepburn (On Golden Pond) *\n\nAnalysis: Streep is the best #2 in this category in seven years. She also earns the first of her incredible five Consensus wins for Best Actress (plus her overwhelming one in Supporting Actress in 1979).\n\nThis is the only nomination for Karen Allen. It’s the first nom for both Susan Sarandon and Kathleen Turner. It’s the fourth for Keaton (and her second win). It’s already the fifth for Streep, thanks to her three nominations in 1979.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nHoward Rollins, Jr. (Ragtime) *\n\nJack Nicholson (Reds) *\n\nNicol Williamson (Excalibur)\n\nJohn Gielgud (Arthur) **\n\nIan Holm (Chariots of Fire) *\n\nMandy Patinken (Ragtime)\n\nBrad Dourif (Ragtime)\n\nRobert Preston (S.O.B.)\n\nAnalysis: Nicholson has the highest 2nd place Consensus finish to-date and won’t be passed until 1993. Both Gielgud (Oscar, Globe, LAFC, NYFC wins, BAFTA nom) and Nicholson (BSFC, NBR, BAFTA wins, Oscar, Globe noms) have over 200 points and no one else has over 100. Gielgud is the first Oscar winner in eight years not to be either my #1 or 2.\n\nThese are the only nominations for Rollins, Gielgud and Williamson. It’s the second nomination for Holm. Nicholson beats them all, earning his seventh nomination and moving into a tie for 6th place.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nElizabeth McGovern (Ragtime) *\n\nMaureen Stapleton (Reds) **\n\nHelen Mirren (Excalibur)\n\nMelinda Dillon (Absence of Malice) *\n\nJane Fonda (On Golden Pond) *\n\nMary Steenburgen (Ragtime)\n\nKate Reid (Atlantic City)\n\nJoan Hackett (Only When I Laugh) *\n\nAnalysis: Stapleton is the best #2 in this category in eight years. She’s also the third straight Consensus winner to receive more than 45% of the total Consensus points.\n\nIt’s the only nomination for McGovern, the first for Helen Mirren and the second for both Maureen Stapleton and Melinda Dillon. It’s the sixth, and last, for Jane Fonda. She finishes with 275 points and in 7th place.\n\nBest Editing:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nGallipoli\n\nReds\n\nRagtime\n\nAtlantic City\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\n\nExcalibur\n\nSuperman II\n\nAnalysis: Raiders is definitely among my contenders for best edited film of all-time. The Oscar score is a 70.0, which is the second highest to-date in this category.\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark *\n\nExcalibur *\n\nReds **\n\nGallipoli\n\nBody Heat\n\nAtlantic City\n\nRagtime *\n\nPennies from Heaven *\n\nAnalysis: The Top 5 is weaker than the previous two years, but still among the five best to-date. I don’t mind the win for Reds because my top three are all fantastically filmed. With those three leading the way, the Oscar score is an 85.0, the highest to-date in a year with five nominees (in other words, the highest since 1950).\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nChariots of Fire\n\nRagtime\n\nBody Heat\n\nSuperman II\n\nTime Bandits\n\nThe Lady from Musashino\n\nVictory\n\nAnalysis: John Williams writes the best score in film history, earning his fifth straight nomination and his fourth win in five years. Williams is now at 325 points and tied for 3rd place. Meanwhile, the score for Chariots of Fire is one of the greatest #2 finishes in film history. In third place, is the first nomination for Randy Newman, my dad’s high school classmate. In 4th place is John Barry, earning his fourth nomination. In fifth place is not John Williams, but rather Ken Thorne, with his new music for Superman II. Another strong Oscar score (75.9), the highest in the category since 1960 and the third highest to-date.\n\nA quick note about the clip below. I really wanted the end of the film for the score. This was the only clip on YouTube I found. I don’t know why it has a TIE Fighter superimposed on the shot or why the credits for The Empire Strikes Back comes up. Ah, the mysteries of YouTube.\n\nBest Sound:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nExcalibur\n\nGallipoli\n\nReds\n\nSuperman II\n\nRagtime\n\nBlow Out\n\nPennies from Heaven\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nRagtime\n\nExcalibur\n\nReds\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\n\nThe Last Metro\n\nAtlantic City\n\nTime Bandits\n\nAnalysis: The Top 5 is tied with the year before for the best Top 5 to-date. The Oscar score is marred by their nomination of Heaven’s Gate over Excalibur.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nClash of the Titans\n\nTime Bandits\n\nExcalibur\n\nSuperman II\n\nDragonslayer\n\nOutland\n\nAnalysis: Tied with 1979 for the best Top 5 to-date. Thanks to Raiders and Star Wars, I didn’t really appreciate the effects in Clash of the Titans at the time, but my appreciation of Harryhausen can be seen in the review here.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nExcalibur\n\nSuperman II\n\nGallipoli\n\nTime Bandits\n\nBlow Out\n\nFor Your Eyes Only\n\nOutland\n\nAnalysis: Raiders won a special Oscar in this category. The third best Top 5 to-date.\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nRagtime\n\nExcalibur\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nReds\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\n\nTime Bandits\n\nPennies from Heaven\n\nChariots of Fire\n\nAnalysis: The second best Top 5 to-date. With all five nominees in my Top 8, it also earns an Oscar score of 89.2, the highest in seven years.\n\nBest Makeup\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nExcalibur\n\nAn American Werewolf in London\n\nThe Howling\n\nTime Bandits\n\nClash of the Titans\n\nScanners\n\nThe Last Metro\n\nAnalysis: The third best Top 5 to-date, but in the first year of it being a competitive Oscar nomination, the score is a terrible 23.5, as they miss out on both Raiders and Excalibur (the other Oscar nominee was Heartbeeps).\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“Arthur’s Theme” (Arthur)\n\n“One More Hour” (Ragtime)\n\n“For Your Eyes Only” (For Your Eyes Only)\n\n“The Inquisition” (History of the World Part I)\n\n“Dreamaway” (Time Bandits)\n\n“Best of Friends” (The Fox and the Hound)\n\n“Hey! A Movie” (The Great Muppet Caper)\n\n“The First Time it Happens” (The Great Muppet Caper)\n\nAnalysis: Oscars.org lists songs from different films. It lists 147 songs from 53 different films. I have only seen 22 of those films (accounting for 65 songs). I have seen the film with the most songs listed (Heavy Metal) but not the next two (The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, Sharky’s Machine). Overall, it’s a pretty damn weak year for songs, especially when compared to a year like 1979. Just look at how “For Your Eyes Only” was my 3rd Best Bond song and earns a nomination, while my #1 Bond song (“A View to a Kill”) won’t earn a nomination in 1985 because it’s such a tougher year for original songs. This is one of those categories where there is no #9 on my list. “The First Time It Happens” barely made my list.\n\nThis is only the fourth time since 1949 that I agree with the Oscar winner and it will be another seven years before it happens again.\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nThe Fox and the Hound\n\nAnalysis: There are seven eligible films (three of which were not listed at oscars.org), tied for the second most to-date. The Fox and the Hound is the weakest film to ever win the award, just scraping by with a 76, the lowest score possible to still be eligible for my list. Since the total films will now start growing, they will be listed separately down below by the Foreign films.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nDas Boot *\n\nMephisto *\n\nThree Brothers *\n\nPixote **\n\nThe Boat is Full\n\nMan of Iron\n\nnote: Films in green were submitted to the Academy but not nominated. There are none this year, meaning the Academy did a damn good job with what was submitted – it’s rare for four nominees to make my Top 6 (the fifth nominee, Muddy River, ranked 10th). The five nominees averaged a 79.2, the second best to-date, behind only 1968, and it won’t be beaten until 2000.\n\nAnalysis: Argentina Brazil (Pixote) and Switzerland (The Boat is Full) earn their first Nighthawk nominations while Hungary (Mephisto) earns its first in 15 years. For only the third time since 1963, France does not earn a nomination and it will be another seven years before it misses out again. It’s the first time since 1964 and second time since 1947 that none of the big four foreign directors earn a nomination (Kurosawa, Bergman, Truffaut, Buñuel). Truffaut does make a film, but it’s his last and one of his weakest.\n\nIt’s the best Top 5 and best Top 10 in eight years. Man of Iron is the first film to make my list and not earn a nomination in eight years. Das Boot is the best winner in eight years but Mephisto is the weakest #2 in eleven years. The 10 point difference between them is the largest between a #1 and #2 since 1946.\n\nBy Film:\n\nnote: They’re in points order. You get twice as many points for a win as for a nomination. Hopefully your math skills will let you figure out the system.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (685)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Editing, Cinematography, Original Score, Sound, Art Direction, Visual Effects, Sound Editing, Costume Design, Makeup\n\nReds (440)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Editing, Cinematography, Sound, Art Direction, Costume Design\n\nExcalibur (325)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Cinematography, Sound, Art Direction, Visual Effects, Sound Editing, Costume Design, Makeup\n\nRagtime (270)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Editing, Original Score, Art Direction, Costume Design, Original Song\n\nAtlantic City (230)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Editing\n\nGallipoli (225)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Editing, Cinematography, Sound, Sound Editing\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman (185)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Art Direction, Costume Design\n\nAbsence of Malice (105)\n\nOriginal Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nBody Heat (85)\n\nActress, Cinematography, Original Score\n\nSuperman II (85)\n\nOriginal Score, Sound, Visual Effects, Sound Editing\n\nThe Lady from Musashino (60)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Foreign Film (1951)\n\nTime Bandits (60)\n\nVisual Effects, Sound Editing, Makeup, Original Song\n\nChariots of Fire (55)\n\nSupporting Actor, Original Score\n\nArthur (50)\n\nSupporting Actor, Original Song\n\nBuddy, Buddy (40)\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nThe Fox and the Hound (40)\n\nAnimated Film\n\nOn Golden Pond (30)\n\nSupporting Actress\n\nClash of the Titans (20)\n\nVisual Effects\n\nThe Last Metro (20)\n\nForeign Film (1980)\n\nPixote (20)\n\nForeign Film\n\nThe Howling (10)\n\nMakeup\n\nAn American Werewolf in London (10)\n\nMakeup\n\nFor Your Eyes Only (10)\n\nOriginal Song\n\nThe History of the World Part II (10)\n\nOriginal Song\n\nAnalysis: There are six fewer films receiving nominations than the year before. Raiders will end up with the second most award points of the decade. Ragtime is tied for sixth most points without a Best Picture nomination to-date. Excalibur is tied for the second most nominations without a win (12) and has the fifth most points to-date.\n\nBest Film Not Nominated for Any Nighthawk Awards:\n\nMy Dinner with Andre\n\nAnalysis: I give it a 75, which puts it right at the top of ***, but I just don’t think the Screenplay is quite good enough to make my list.\n\nBiggest Awards Film Not Nominated for Any Nighthawk Awards:\n\nPennies from Heaven\n\nAnalysis: It won Best Cinematography from the NSFC and BSFC (but didn’t earn an Oscar nom because, hey, it’s Gordon Willis), won Best Actress – Comedy / Musical at the Globes and was nominated for Picture and Actor (and to be fair, earns Actor and Actress nominations in my Comedy / Musical awards) and was nominated for Adapted Screenplay, Sound and Costume Design at the Oscars. It does end up with 5 Top 10 finishes but nothing higher than its 7th place finish in Costume Design.\n\nNighthawk Golden Globes:\n\nDrama:\n\nBest Picture\n\nGallipoli\n\nReds\n\nAtlantic City\n\nExcalibur\n\nRagtime\n\nAnalysis: Gallipoli and Atlantic City were both nominated for Foreign Film (and thus ineligible for Picture) at the Globes.\n\nThis is the weakest Top 5 in this category in nine years.\n\nBest Director\n\nPeter Weir (Gallipoli)\n\nWarren Beatty (Reds)\n\nJohn Boorman (Excalibur)\n\nLouis Malle (Atlantic City)\n\nLawrence Kasdan (Body Heat)\n\nAnalysis: These are the only Drama nominations for Beatty and Kasdan. Malle earns his first nomination, Weir his second and Boorman his third.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman\n\nRagtime\n\nExcalibur\n\nThe Lady from Musashino\n\nSuperman II\n\nAnalysis: If I had considered Superman II a Comedy, this category would have been incomplete, a rarity in Drama.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nAtlantic City\n\nReds\n\nGallipoli\n\nAbsence of Malice\n\nBody Heat\n\nAnalysis: Lawrence Kasdan earns his second straight nomination. This is the best Top 5 in this category in five years which is especially surprising since Atlantic City is the weakest winner in this category in nine years.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nWarren Beatty (Reds)\n\nBurt Lancaster (Atlantic City)\n\nPaul Newman (Absence of Malice)\n\nJeremy Irons (The French Lieutenant’s Woman)\n\nHenry Fonda (On Golden Pond)\n\nAnalysis: Irons earns his first nomination, Beatty his fourth (and second win) and Newman his fifth. Lancaster and Fonda both earn their seventh (and last) nominations.\n\nBest Actress\n\nDiane Keaton (Reds)\n\nMeryl Streep (The French Lieutenant’s Woman)\n\nKathleen Turner (Body Heat)\n\nSusan Sarandon (Atlantic City)\n\nCatherine Deneuve (The Last Metro)\n\nAnalysis: This is, surprisingly, the only Drama nom for Kathleen Turner. It’s the first for Sarandon, the third for Deneuve, the third for Keaton, and already the fourth for Streep.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nHoward Rollins, Jr. (Ragtime)\n\nJack Nicholson (Reds)\n\nNicol Williamson (Excalibur)\n\nIan Holm (Chariots of Fire)\n\nMandy Patinken (Ragtime)\n\nAnalysis: These are the only nominations for Williamson and Patinken, the first for Rollins and the second for Holm. Nicholson earns his 7th and moves into the Top 10 in Drama points.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nElizabeth McGovern (Ragtime)\n\nMaureen Stapleton (Reds)\n\nHelen Mirren (Excalibur)\n\nMelinda Dillon (Absence of Malice)\n\nJane Fonda (On Golden Pond)\n\nAnalysis: With all of the best performances stacked in Drama, this is the strongest Top 5 since 1959.\n\nThis is the first nom for Mirren and the second for McGovern, Stapleton and Dillon. It’s the sixth for Fonda. She’s now at 345 points and in sixth place in Drama.\n\nPoints:\n\nReds (335)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nAtlantic City (245)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Actress\n\nRagtime (240)\n\nPicture, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nGallipoli (230)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay\n\nExcalibur (195)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman (150)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actor, Actress\n\nBody Heat (120)\n\nDirector, Original Screenplay, Actress\n\nAbsence of Malice (105)\n\nOriginal Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nOn Golden Pond (65)\n\nActor, Supporting Actress\n\nSuperman II (40)\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nThe Lady from Musashino (40)\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nThe Last Metro (35)\n\nActress\n\nChariots of Fire (30)\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nAnalysis: The four Drama acting winners as a whole are the strongest since 1974 and among the strongest ever. Reds is an oddity here, having the most points without winning any of the three biggest awards.\n\nBest Drama Not Nominated for Any Nighthawk Golden Globes:\n\nPixote\n\nAnalysis: Hector Babenco’s film is moving, but as my #10 Drama of the year, can’t make it close to any Top 5.\n\nComedy / Musical:\n\nBest Picture\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nBuddy Buddy\n\nThe Fox and the Hound\n\nAnalysis: The weakest Top 5 in five years (counting the next two films which don’t make my list – Zoot Suit and The Four Seasons).\n\nBest Director\n\nSteven Spielberg (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\nTerry Gilliam (Time Bandits)\n\nBilly Wilder (Buddy Buddy)\n\nAnalysis: Spielberg earns his first Comedy nomination (and win) and Gilliam his first nom. Billy Wilder earns his 8th nomination and finishes his career with 495 points, third all-time behind Chaplin and Buñuel.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nBuddy Buddy\n\nAnalysis: With his final film, Billy Wilder earns his 14th Comedy nomination and his 7th win (third in Adapted Comedy) and finishes in 1st place with 840 points, where he will stay until Woody Allen ties him in 1987 and passes him in 1994.\n\nNot the lowest Top 5 all-time, but the lowest since 1958.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nThe Four Seasons\n\nTime Bandits\n\nArthur\n\nAnalysis: Lawrence Kasdan earns his 1st Comedy win.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nHarrison Ford (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\nDudley Moore (Arthur)\n\nSteve Martin (Pennies from Heaven)\n\nWalter Matthau (Buddy Buddy)\n\nAlan Alda (The Four Seasons)\n\nAnalysis: Matthau was nominated, but for First Monday in October.\n\nThese are the only nominations for Moore and Ford. It’s the second for Alda. It’s the first for Martin, but he will earn five more before the end of the decade. It’s the sixth, and last, for Matthau, who finishes with 270 points and in 6th place for Comedy points.\n\nBest Actress\n\nKaren Allen (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\nBernadette Peters (Pennies from Heaven)\n\nCarol Burnett (The Four Seasons)\n\nAnalysis: It’s the only nomination for Allen and Peters and the second for Burnett.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nJohn Gielgud (Arthur)\n\nRobert Preston (S.O.B.)\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\nDenholm Elliott (Raiders of the Lost Ark)\n\nAnalysis: It’s the only Comedy nominations for Gielgud and Rhys-Davies. It’s the first for Elliott, who will earn two more in the decade. It’s the second for Preston, who will this award the next year.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nLiza Minnelli (Arthur)\n\nAnalysis: Minnelli was nominated as a lead at the Globes in what was a pretty thin category. It’s the third nomination and second win in Comedy for Minnelli.\n\nPoints:\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (470)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actor\n\nBuddy, Buddy (210)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor\n\nArthur (195)\n\nOriginal Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nThe Four Seasons (110)\n\nOriginal Screenplay, Actor, Actress\n\nTime Bandits (100)\n\nDirector, Original Screenplay\n\nPennies from Heaven (70)\n\nActor, Actress\n\nThe Fox and the Hound (50)\n\nPicture\n\nS.O.B. (30)\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nAnalysis: A slim group, and if I didn’t count Raiders it would be a horror show.\n\nBest Comedy Not Nominated for any Nighthawk Golden Globes:\n\nZoot Suit\n\nAnalysis: The fourth best Comedy (actually, Musical) of the year, but I didn’t think it was good enough in any category to merit inclusion on the list. I don’t blame the Globes for nominating it though – it is a high ***.\n\nRoundup for the Year in Film:\n\nEligible Films I Have Seen: 144\n\nBy Stars:\n\n****: 5\n\n***.5: 10\n\n***: 65\n\n**.5: 27\n\n**: 16\n\n*.5: 4\n\n*: 9\n\n.5: 7\n\n0: 1\n\nAverage Film Score for the Year, out of 100: 57.51\n\nAnalysis: Up close to a point, but still quite bad. That’s because while there are a lot more *** films than the year before, there is a dearth of **** films. It’s the fewest **** films since 1972 and there won’t be another year after this with less than 7. It also joins the year before as only the second year where over 10% of the films are * or less.\n\nOscar-Nominated Films I Have Not Seen:\n\nnone\n\nOscar Quality:\n\nBest Picture: It’s a big drop from the year before, down to #34. That’s the worst of the stretch from 1979 to 1984. Yet, it is still better than any year prior to 1972 except 1961. The one top film (Raiders – #11) is balanced out by the bottom one (On Golden Pond – #450).\n\nThe Winners: The rank, among the nominees is a 2.5, the worst since 1964. While there are seven categories where the Oscar choose the best of the nominees (four of which are won by Raiders), it is also the first time in eight years where there is more than one category where they gave the Oscar to the worst nominee: Adapted Screenplay (first time since 1961) and Costume Design (first time since 1955). It’s the first time since 1958 that both the actors (3.25 average) and major categories (3.75 average) have an average of 3.25 or worse. Among all nominees, it’s not too bad, with a 4.37 overall average, lowered to 3.56 without Best Picture. That’s because while they didn’t a great job of choosing among the nominees, they weren’t overall bad choices. Best Picture (19th) is the only category where the winner falls outside my Top 10.\n\nThe Nominees: Overall, this year sets a new high for an Oscar score with a 75.5 (although that will be beaten the next year). It is lead by a new high in the Tech score with 75.5. The acting is a bit strange – it’s the second year in a row with all four acting categories over 80. However, this is the only year so far when all four categories have a score over 80 but none of them have a score over 90, with Supporting Actor (88.2) the highest. The major categories only earn a 63.2, the lowest since 1969, kept down by the nominations in all three categories for Chariots of Fire and On Golden Pond.\n\nGolden Globe Best Picture – Comedy / Musical: This year is exceedingly strange. As can be seen from my Comedy / Musical awards, I don’t think it’s a good year for them (and the only nomination Raiders received was Director, so it’s not certain they would have considered it one). But there are 66 years in this category (not counting the three years that only had a winner, but counting as extra years the five years where Musical was a separate category). In 55 of those 66 years, at least one film among the nominees ranks among the Top 150 nominees (out of 329 films). This year is not one of those years – the best film, Zoot Suit, ranks at #157. So, you would expect this year to rank near the bottom. But it doesn’t; it ranks 36th out of 66. It is one of only 10 years that doesn’t have any films ranking higher than ***, yet it ranks above 30 other years. How? Well, because it’s a year of the quite good, but not very good. Zoot Suit might be the best of the films (a 74, ranked at #157) but Arthur is the weakest (a 71, ranked at #187). The other three (The Four Seasons, Pennies from Heaven, S.O.B.) are all also high-level *** films. There aren’t any great, or even very good films, but none of the films are weak. More importantly, all of them are my Top 10 for Comedy / Musical in the year. Do I think they could have done better? Well, certainly. But, if they didn’t count Raiders as Comedy (certainly a possibility), the best they could have hoped for was a 74.6 average of the top five and they averaged a 73.0. So, with what was available, the Globes did okay (for the record, the other films I have above Arthur but not good enough to make my list are Time Bandits and For Your Eyes Only).\n\nTop 5 Films of the Year:\n\n1 – Raiders of the Lost Ark (reviewed here and here)\n\n2 – Gallipoli (dir. Peter Weir)\n\nHow will history judge us? How will that judgment change over time? Let’s look at the case of Winston Churchill. His career went through massive ups and downs (he became First Lord of the Admiralty while still in his 30’s then was forced from the position during the Great War, then of course, his importance during the Second World War, followed by his removal from power before the war’s conclusion). If you start to type in “Greatest Man of the 20th Century” it will actually fill in Winston Churchill afterwards. Yet, a century from now, when even more time has passed and the legacy of imperialism is studied, how will he be judged? I mention Churchill, of course, because Churchill has long received the blame for the disastrous Dardanelles campaign, the British chain of mistakes that ended with hundreds of thousands of casualties and one battle of which is portrayed in the film Gallipoli.\n\nI certainly always thought of Churchill as the man who deserved the large share of the blame for these events, which director Peter Weir so masterfully depicts in this film (with, it must be said, historical inaccuracies). In this same spot, in the year before, was Breaker Morant, the sister film to this one, and that becomes more relevant than ever. Both films helped the Australian New Wave become such a big success, with Weir going on to numerous Oscar nominations and launching (in conjunction with the first two Mad Max films) the international career of Mel Gibson back when he was actually an actor with charisma and presence and not just a deranged lunatic. So, how interesting was it to realize that while many share the blame for the disaster that lead to all those Australian troops lying dead half a world away from home, that Lord Kitchener, the same man whose policies lead to the execution of Breaker Morant himself, shares more blame than Churchill. Churchill, in fact, tried to do what he could to prevent such a disaster:\n\nThe political world did not know at the time that, if Churchill had been listened to, the Dardanelles campaign could have been won at a time when only a few hundred casualties had been incurred; and that it was because the admirals and generals had overruled him that Britain had embarked on a campaign that was in the process of costing her more than 200,000 casualties. Thus it failed to grasp the essential fact that Britain’s generals and admirals were losing the war for her and that the country urgently needed not less but more civilian control of the military. (A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East by David Fromkin, p 161)\n\nBut that’s just the history part. Gallipoli would be nothing if it were just a history lesson (especially, since as I said, there are inaccuracies that fit the film’s theme of the British using the Australians and letting them take the brunt). Well over a third of the film takes place before the two main characters, both of them fast on their feet who meet in a race, even enlist. The film shows the kind of life that Australians were living – they were very different from the rest of the British Empire. One of them (Gibson) has been working on a railroad and living on the edge. He is carefree and relaxed. The other has been relentlessly trained as a runner by his uncle and his running is a kind of release (not so dissimilar from a far inferior film about two runners from this same year that managed to win Best Picture at the Oscars). Both of them are off to enlist in the war almost as a form of adventure. They have no firm notions of queen and country. This is just the next step for something different.\n\nLittle could they know what was waiting for them. The beautiful vistas of the outback that Weir has been given us make way for the bloody trenches on the edge of the beach. Even though they are Australian troops, they fall under the purvey of the English and the English Army is a very different thing. They want order and discipline and that means taking a hill that can not be taken.\n\nIn this film, in the attempt to find order in chaos, to attempt to do something that can not be done, to find meaning in meaninglessness, we see the pain and horror of war. And behind it all are the British, striving to do what they know can not be done because their relentless need for order is what caused the botch job in the first place and left these men stranded on the end of a beach trying to take a hill that can not be taken. Watch the film and see it all in painful poetry. Or read Fromkin’s book and wonder at how much this all got screwed up and the thousands upon thousands of people who died for it.\n\n3 – Reds (reviewed here)\n\n4 – Atlantic City (reviewed here)\n\n5 – Excalibur (reviewed here)\n\n5 Worst Films (#1 being the worst):\n\nManiac\n\nTarzan the Ape Man\n\nMommie Dearest\n\nHappy Birthday to Me\n\nCaveman\n\nnote: I was really surprised to not have The Legend of the Lone Ranger appear here, but I give it a 10, and these films earn a 0, 7, 8, 8 and 9. Tarzan the Ape Man is the worst Tarzan film I have ever seen, which is saying a lot since I saw Tarzan and the Lost City in the theater.\n\nThe Razzies: I’ve made my way through the Razzies, in order to compare them to the worst films of the year. The winner is my third worst film of the year and my second worst is nominated. The other three nominees are my 6th worst (The Legend of the Lone Ranger), my 9th worst (Heaven’s Gate) and my 14th worst (Endless Love). They earn a total of 63 points, so they average a 12.6, which almost pushes it to *, so they could have made better choices (rounding out my Top 10 worst are Hawk the Slayer, Saturday the 14th and An American Werewolf in London). But I don’t blame them for what they nominated: two of their nominees were directed by former Oscar nominees (Mommie Dearest by Frank Perry and Endless Love by Franco Zeffirelli) while Heaven’s Gate was directed by a former Oscar winner (Michael Cimino). The Legend of the Lone Ranger, for me, is the most disappointing because I wanted it to be good. I even went back to it in the early 2000’s, thinking I must have been too hard on it (I hadn’t seen it since I was a kid) and ended up rating it much lower than I had originally (I originally had it at *.5, but re-rating it, I pushed it down to .5). I don’t blame them for passing over slasher films like Maniac (below) or Happy Birthday to Me (astoundingly, also directed by a former Oscar nominee, J. Lee Thompson) because those are supposed to be bad. The films they nominated weren’t expected to be so awful, yet were.\n\nManiac (dir. William Lustig)\n\nI don’t give 0 stars lightly. A lack of production values alone won’t get you there. Terrible acting won’t get you there. A pathetic script and inept direction won’t get you there. If you manage to hit a trifecta of all of those things, you might just manage to get there (Ed Wood did, three times). But generally I require something more to push you down to that level of utter dreck. There’s a reason why, out of over 13,000 films that I’ve seen, only 36 of them have managed to score 0 stars. I always tried to avoid terrible films. I don’t seek them out because I don’t enjoy watching them, even for camp value (I don’t like camp). Even having watched my way through the Razzie nominees of the past 35 years, I have added almost none of those to the dreaded 0 star list. It generally requires something extra. A bit of moral repulsiveness to bring it below the level of .5.\n\nManiac has that. It’s not just that it looks like it was filmed by a couple of guys who somehow managed to get their hands on a camera (which is true – it was shot almost as a guerilla film). It’s not even the subject matter. There have been films about morally reprehensible killers before but that doesn’t necessarily earn them 0 stars. But this film, about a schlubby guy who kills women and then scalps them, is just not worth watching. The filmmakers seem to have a motive for him (beautiful women must die!) but that’s just an excuse for the excess of blood and gore that throws itself up on the screen. It’s like they took Psychology 101 and decided that with that, and a lot of fake blood, and enough gore to actually make Gene Siskel walk out of the theater, they could make a feature film. And so they did. But they not only did it without any taste, they did it without any style and they did it without any intelligence. Films like this can be interesting. Hell, if you really want a good look at a deranged psychopath watch Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. That took a long time to film, years to get released, was filmed with very little budget and is pretty hard to watch. But it has intelligence behind it and it has style behind it. You can understand precisely why the filmmakers were making it.\n\nPoints:\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations: Raiders of the Lost Ark (14)\n\nMost Nighthawk Awards: Raiders of the Lost Ark (11)\n\nMost Nighthawk Points: Raiders of the Lost Ark (685)\n\nWorst Film Nominated for a Nighthawk Award: An American Werewolf in London\n\n2nd Place Award: Excalibur (Cinematography, Sound, Sound Editing, Costume Design, Makeup)\n\n6th Place Award: Ragtime (Picture, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Sound)\n\nMost Nighthawk Drama Nominations: Reds (7)\n\nMost Nighthawk Drama Awards: Gallipoli / Reds / Ragtime (2)\n\nMost Nighthawk Drama Points: Reds (335)\n\nWorst Film Nominated for a Nighthawk Drama Award: On Golden Pond\n\nMost Nighthawk Comedy Nominations: Raiders of the Lost Ark (7)\n\nMost Nighthawk Comedy Awards: Raiders of the Lost Ark (5)\n\nMost Nighthawk Comedy Points: Raiders of the Lost Ark (470)\n\nWorst Film Nominated for a Nighthawk Comedy Award: Arthur\n\nNote: * means a Nighthawk record up to this point; ** ties a Nighthawk record\n\nNotes:\n\nGallipoli actually had the most points from its second place finishes (Picture, Director, Editing), but had two fewer than Excalibur.\n\nRagtime is only the seventh film to earn 4 6th place finishes, which is especially impressive since it earned 8 nominations.\n\nIt’s especially strange for three films to tie with 2 Drama awards each and for none of those films to have won either of the writing awards.\n\nArthur is actually pretty high for the year (#28, my #10 Comedy), but there weren’t many films nominated for my Comedy awards.\n\nProgressive Leaders:\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations: The Wizard of Oz / The Godfather (18)\n\nMost Nighthawk Awards: The Wizard of Oz / Bonnie and Clyde (14)\n\nMost Nighthawk Points: Bonnie and Clyde (865)\n\nMost Nighthawk Awards without winning Best Picture: Frankenstein / The Magnificent Ambersons (6)\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations without a Best Picture Nomination: Yojimbo (11)\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations without a Nighthawk Award: Throne of Blood (13)\n\nActor: Humphrey Bogart (475)\n\nActress: Katharine Hepburn (560)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder (585)\n\nWriter: Billy Wilder (960)\n\nCinematographer: Sven Nykvist (275)\n\nComposer: Max Steiner (450)\n\nForeign Film: Ingmar Bergman (500)\n\nBreakdown by Genre (Foreign in parenthesis, best film in genre following, avg. score is afterwards, in parenthesis):\n\nDrama: 51 (27) – Reds (64.5)\n\nForeign: 50 – The Last Metro (64.5)\n\nComedy: 28 (7) – Buddy, Buddy (50.4)\n\nHorror: 12 (1) – The Hand (33.9)\n\nAction: 9 (1) – Superman II (57.4)\n\nMusical: 8 (2) – Zoot Suit (56.5)\n\nCrime: 7 (4) – Atlantic City (64.9)\n\nFantasy: 7 (1) – Raiders of the Lost Ark (62.7)\n\nWar: 6 (4) – Gallipoli (71.5)\n\nKids: 5 (2) – The Fox and the Hound (69.8)\n\nMystery: 3 – Eyewitness (50.3)\n\nSuspense: 3 – Body Heat (71.3)\n\nAdventure: 2 (1) – Outlaw: The Saga of Gisli (37)\n\nWestern: 2 – Heaven’s Gate (13.5)\n\nSci-Fi: 1 – Outland (66)\n\nAnalysis: Dramas account for only 35.4% of all films, the lowest in five years and it won’t be lower again for over a decade. The 7 Crime films are the most between 1975 and 1990; this makes 300 total Crime films and it catches Westerns and moves into the Top 5. The 7 Fantasy films are by far the most to-date; Raiders joins La Belle et la bete as only the second Fantasy film to win the Nighthawk.. But it’s countered by the 1 Sci-Fi film, the fewest in seven years (and there won’t ever be this few again). The 6 War films are the most in a decade.\n\nFor the first time, there are 2 Top 10 Fantasy films and it’s the first time since 1947 that there are even 2 Top 20 Fantasy films. Superman II is the last Action film to make the Top 10 until 2003. For only the second time since 1965 there are no Comedies in the Top 10. There are two Musicals in the Top 20 for the first time since 1964 but that says more about the weaker films in the Top 20 than the quality of the Musicals. In spite of having 50 Foreign films, there are only 3 in the Top 20, the lowest since 1953. There are only two Westerns, and they are both truly awful (Heaven’s Gate, The Legend of the Lone Ranger).\n\nStudio Note: United Artists (10 films), combined with United Artists classics (5) leads the way. It’s followed by Universal with 14. But, it’s Paramount, with 12 films that is truly remarkable. Paramount has the top 4 spots on my list and #6. It is the first (and possibly only) time a studio has had five films in the Top 10, let alone five in the top six. It’s not just me – three of those films were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. Raiders becomes the 7th Paramount film to win the Nighthawk, only the second studio to reach that many. With Paramount leading the way, for the second year in a row, 9 of the top 10 are from the major studios, as are 16 of the Top 20. The lone holdout is Excalibur, the best of 7 films from Orion, which is quickly growing in quantity and quality.\n\n7 Films Eligible for Best Animated Film (ranked, with ***, director and studio in parenthesis)\n\nThe Fox and the Hound (***.5, Berman / Rich, Disney)\n\nThe Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie (***, Freleng, Warner)\n\nFlaklypa Grand Prix (***, Caprino, GG Communications)\n\nHeavy Metal (***, Potterton, Columbia)\n\nChie the Brat (***, Takahata, Toho)\n\nSon of the White Mare (**.5, Jankovics, PannoniaFilm)\n\nAmerican Pop (**, Bakshi, Columbia)\n\nNote: This is the only Nighthawk Award for Berman (who worked at Disney for over 40 years, but only finally earned directing credits for The Fox and the Hound and The Black Cauldron) and Richard Rich (who was much younger and would also direct The Black Cauldron, then would leave Disney and make the Swan Princess films). It’s the 19th time I have given out this award and the 17th time it has gone to Disney. But Takahata is about to found Ghibli with Hayao Miyazaki and they will start winning the award soon. There will soon be more and more animated films (thus this separate list). As recently as 1964, Disney accounted for more than half the animated feature films. In 1980, they had 25 of the 91 films (27.4%) and now they have 26 out of 98 (26.5%). By the end of the decade, they will be at exactly 20%. There is also a film here by Ralph Bakshi, who continues to put out his film which are cult favorites but which I think are terrible.\n\n47 Films Eligible for Best Foreign Film (alphabetical, with director and country in parenthesis – red are ****, blue are ***.5 – both those colors qualify for my Best Foreign Film Award; an asterisk means it was the Official selection for the Oscar, two asterisks were nominated, three asterisks won the Oscar):\n\nLe Beau mariage (Rohmer, France)\n\nBeau Pere (Blier, France)\n\nThe Black Cat (Fulci, Italy)\n\nThe Boat is Full (Imhoof, Switzerland) **\n\nBolero (Lelouch, France)\n\nChie the Brat (Takahata, Japan)\n\nChildren’s Island (Pollak, Sweden) *\n\nChristiane F.

France is #1 again, with 8 films, followed by West Germany with 7. There are also 6 from Italy and 5 from Japan, making this the first time since 1965 where I have seen at least 5 films from four different countries. Surprisingly, it won’t happen again for well over a decade. I have my first film from Iceland. The 7 films from West Germany are the most from any country other than France, Italy or Japan between 1951 and 1992. For the first time since 1961, I have seen no Soviet films – but that is because the Soviet submission to the Oscars was a documentary and I don’t count those on my regular lists.\n\nForeign Films Submitted for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars That I Haven’t Seen:\n\nArgentina: The Underground Man (dir. Sarquis)\n\nBelgium: Le Grand Paysage d’Alexis Droeven (dir. Andrien)\n\nCzechoslovakia: The Divine Emma (dir. Krejcik)\n\nFinland: Sign of the Beast (dir. Pakkasvirta)\n\nIsrael: A Thousand Little Kisses (dir. Recanati)\n\nNetherlands: Come-Back! (dir. Severijn)\n\nSpain: National Heritage (dir. Garcia Berlanga)\n\nnote: At this point I am making a concerted effort to see as many submitted films as I can. The full list can be found here. This year I am 18 for 25 (72%), with four of the countries the same from 1980 (Czechoslovakia, Finland, Israel, Netherlands).\n\nThere is only one fewer submission than the year before, but as is usual, the countries are different. Gone this year are Brazil, India (the start of three straight years without a submission for both), Portugal, Colombia, East Germany and Cameroon. Back this year after a one-year gap are Egypt, Belgium and Argentina while Greece and Mexico are back after slightly longer gaps. There are no brand new countries.\n\nArgentina is a rare miss – only the third time and the last until at least the 2010’s. Belgium is a problem – this is the 9th time they’ve submitted and the 7th time I haven’t been able to see it. The Czechs continue to be a problem as well – this is the fifth time in the last seven submissions I am missing. This is only the second Finnish submission but also the second I am missing – I won’t see one from Finland until 1990. It’s the third of a five year stretch where I am missing the Israeli submission. It’s the fourth of a five year stretch where I am missing the submission from the Netherlands. It’s the only time from 1979 to 1984 that I am missing the Spanish submission but it’s also the only time in that stretch that their submission wasn’t nominated.\n\nFilms Eligible in This Year But Originally Released in a Different Year:\n\nThe Lady from Musashino (1951)\n\nSigns of Life (1968)\n\nFlaklypa Grand Prix (1975)\n\nCoup de Grace (1976)\n\nMan of Marble (1976)\n\nSi c’etait a refaire (1976)\n\nCamoflauge (1977)\n\nLucio Flavio o Passagerios de Agonia (1977)\n\nAn Enemy of the People (1978)\n\nThe Glass Cell (1978)\n\nThe Inglorious Bastards (1978)\n\nThe Shooting Party (1978)\n\nMessidor (1979)\n\nOblomov (1979)\n\nTales from the Vienna Woods (1979)\n\nAtlantic City (1980)\n\nBye Bye Brazil (1980)\n\nLa Cage Aux Folles II (1980)\n\nCity of Women (1980)\n\nConfidence (1980)\n\nEvery Man for Himself (1980)\n\nGaijan, A Brazilian Odyssey (1980)\n\nGood Riddance (1980)\n\nHeaven’s Gate (1980)\n\nJane Austen in Manhattan (1980)\n\nThe Last Metro (1980)\n\nLoulou (1980)\n\nMoscow Does Not Believe in Tears (1980)\n\nRichard’s Things (1980)\n\nSuperman II (1980)\n\nNote: These 30 films average a 63.8. They earn 13 Nighthawk nominations, only 2 of which are for Best Foreign Film. It is balanced by having one of the best films of the year (Atlantic City) and one of the worst (Heaven’s Gate).\n\nFilms Not Listed at Oscars.org:\n\nCamoflauge\n\nChie the Brat\n\nChildren’s Island\n\nDer Bockerer\n\nDocteur Jekyll et les femmes\n\nEijanaika\n\nFast, Fast\n\nFlaklypa Grand Prix\n\nThe Glass Cell\n\nHawk the Slayer\n\nHotel America\n\nIf I Were for Real\n\nThe Inglorious Bastards\n\nJane Austen in Manhattan\n\nJulia Julia\n\nThe Lady from Musashino\n\nLooks and Smiles\n\nLucio Flavio o Passagerios de Agonia\n\nThe Man with the Carnation\n\nMessidor\n\nMojado Power\n\nThe Mystery of Oberwald\n\nNo Mercy, No Future\n\nOutlaw: The Saga of Giali\n\nPeople on the Top\n\nThe Prodigal Son\n\nThe Professional\n\nSi c’etait a refaire\n\nSigns of Life\n\nSilsila\n\nSon of the White Mare\n\nSpetters\n\nTales from the Vienna Woods\n\nUmrao Jean\n\nNote: I use the list at Oscars.org for deciding which year films are eligible in. Some films, however, don’t appear in that database. For those films, I use the IMDb. These are the films that aren’t listed in the Oscars.org database but that end up in this year.\n\nAs is usually the case, most of these are Foreign films which never got an L.A. release. The films marked in orange were those that were submitted for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars.\n\nFilms Released This Year Originally But Eligible in a Different Year:\n\n36 Chowringhee Lane (1982)\n\nThe Beastmaster (1982)\n\nLe Beau mariage (1982)\n\nBlood Wedding (1982)\n\nThe Boat is Full (1982)\n\nBolero (1982)\n\nButterfly (1982)\n\nChristiane F. (1982)\n\nDas Boot (1982)\n\nDiva (1982)\n\nEdo Porn (1982)\n\nGregory’s Girl (1982)\n\nInchon (1982)\n\nLola (1982)\n\nMan of Iron (1982)\n\nThe Martial Club (1982)\n\nMephisto (1982)\n\nPassione d’Amore (1982)\n\nQuartet (1982)\n\nThe Road Warrior (1982)\n\nThree Brothers (1982)\n\nTragedy of a Ridiculous Man (1982)\n\nThe Evil Dead (1983)\n\nHey Good Lookin’ (1983)\n\nMarianne and Juliane (1983)\n\nMuddy River (1983)\n\nPiranha II: The Spawning (1983)\n\nPuberty Blues (1983)\n\nThe Black Cat (1984)\n\nThe Grass is Singing (1984)\n\nHouse by the Cemetery (1984)\n\nDo You Remember Dolly Bell (1985)\n\nLes Plouffe (1985)\n\nHeat-Haze Theatre (1993)\n\nNote: These 34 films average a 60. They are a mix of some truly awful films (Piranha II, Butterfly, Inchon), one truly great film (Das Boot) and a number of very good films (Mephisto, The Evil Dead, The Boat is Full, Three Brothers, Man of Iron). Das Boot reaps the benefits – in this year, it would have received some nominations but would have been stuck behind Raiders, but moved to 1982, it manages to win three awards including Best Director."
