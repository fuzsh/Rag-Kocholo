Shall we begin?\n\nStrange Flowers guide to Berlin: part 2\n\nAt the Weisse Maus there’s a fine line between performer and prostitute, but Anita Berber leaves no doubt that she is not on the menu. She acts up and acts out, urinating on stage, breaking a champagne bottle over a punter’s head.\n\nFaustian act\n\nSafe in exile, Klaus Mann was struck by the parallels between Gustaf Gründgens’ greatest stage role and the Faustian nature of his arrangement with Goering, and put them, thinly veiled, into his novel, Mephisto."
