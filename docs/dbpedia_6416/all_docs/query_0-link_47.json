Sonja is a young independent socialist embarking on a career in nursing during World War 2.\n\nDr. Bethune (Donald Sutherland, 1993) - True story of a Canadian leftist hero. Bethune was one of the ﬁrst great voices for Canadian socialized medicine -- to Spain as a republican partisan who pioneered battleﬁeld blood transfusions during the civil war, and, to Mao's 8th route army, developing battlefield medical innovations in the ﬁght against imperial Japan. - Terry Gaines.\n\nDaens (1992) - In the 1890s, Father Adolf Daens goes to Aalst, a textile town where child labour is rife, pay and working conditions are horrible, the poor have no vote, and the Catholic church backs the petite bourgeoisie in oppressing workers. He writes a few columns for the Catholic paper, and soon workers are listening and the powerful are in an uproar. He's expelled from the Catholic party, so he starts the Christian Democrats and is elected to Parliament. After Rome disciplines him, he must choose between two callings, as priest and as champion of workers. In sub-plots, a courageous young woman falls in love with a socialist and survives a shop foreman's rape; children die; prelates play billiards. (138 min) Summary written by J. Hailey.\n\nDaniel - Timothy Hutton turns in a powerful performance as a young man trying to clear his family name years after his parents are executed for conspiracy.

(130 min.)\n\nEntertaining Angels (Martin Sheen, 1996) - The story of Dorothy Day, the socialist journalist who founded the Catholic Worker newspaper and movement. She went on to demonstrate Christianity as Jesus would have wanted, ministering to those in need. Pressured by clerics she refused to remove the moniker Worker—- due to its socialist connotation -- from her journal's title. -Terry Gaines\n\nFame is the Spur - A British film starring Michael Redgrave on the life of Ramsay MacDonald, the first Labour PM.\n\nThe Good Fight (1983) - A documentary on the Spanish Civil War and the role that America's Lincoln Brigade played in the battle for justice and freedom.\n\nHalf a Life - Winner of the Camera D'Or at the 1982 Cannes Festival and the Cesar, Half a Life is a personal memoir of that brief moment in French history, during the late ‘60's, when the youthful Left seemed to be successfully storming the Bastille.

After being wounded he goes to Barcelona, where he decides to join another group of fighters. They remain in Barcelona and end up ﬁghting other anti-fascist groups. David is disappointed and decides to go back to his old band.\" - Walter de Rijk\n\nLast Emperor, The - Bernardo Bertolucci's beautiful story of the last Emperor of China, demonstrating the necessity and horror of the Chinese Revolution.\n\nMan of Marble (1977, Andrzej Wajda) - This film and Wajda's sequel, Man of Iron, not only documented the Solidarity movement, they became part of it.\"Review by John Sayles, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nMay Fools - A 1990 Louise Malle film about a bourgeois French family screwing around at a funeral in May 1968, and suddenly realizing the country is in revolution.\n\nReds - The 1981 history of John Reed, author of Ten Days That Shook the World and a founder of the American Communist movement, and his wife Louise Bryant. Though the portrayal of Socialist Party politics has an unfortunate tilt towards the Bolshevik faction, the main point is the struggle between love and political sacrifice. Starring Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.\n\nRosa Luxemburg (1986) - The story of the Polish socialist leader who neared turned the tide for socialism in Western Europe after the Russian Revolution. (122 min)\n\nSeeing Red - Done by the same independent producers as Union Maids, this documentary history of the U.S. Communist Party pulls its punches, never asking its respondents the hard questions about support for Uncle Joe, or the Hitler-Stalin pact.\n\nThe Slingshot (1994, Ake Sandgren, Sweden) - The young son of an immigrant Russian-Jewish feminist and a Swedish socialist faces anti-Semitic and anti- Bolshevik hostility in 1920's Sweden. The title of the ﬁlm refers to slingshots the boy makes out of condoms his mother illegally distributes. (Steve Press)\n\nThings to Come - This 1933 H.G.

For five years Jacob Holdt, a young Dane, hitch-hiked 100,000 miles throughout the U .S., living with some 350 families. American Pictures is not only a stunning visual essay on the vast disparities between American affluence and poverty, but also a fascinating personal meditation on one man's experience. This is a very powerful move and if shown should allow for an hour after the presentation for discussion. It is often times appalling and is continuously disturbing. (105m min.)\n\nGrapes of Wrath, The (1940) - Henry Fonda in the classic tale of exploited Okie labourers in the 30's.\n\nLet Him Have It - that is the English title to a UK film, a naturalist style production in which a young man, with a mental age of 12, is sentenced to hang for \"inciting\" a fellow youth to murder. A little over—long perhaps, but the \"Bentley case\" certainly aroused some heated debate at the time, so it seems worth-while in an era in which young people around the world are hung as part of some bizarre social ritual designed perhaps to prove \"justice always works\"\n\nThe Saint of Fort Washington - About the drugs trade and criminality thriving in the homeless shelters of your country, as the pollies pretend that the have \"solved\" homelessness. Very sad ending involving the death of a young schizophrenic {as many homeless are}, and the prolonged loneliness of a black, Vietnam war vet who was his only friend. Very bleak and disillusioning, a real tear-jerker.\n\nSammie and Rosie Get Laid - An interracial couple deal with life in Thatcher's England.\n\nThe Skin Game - 1931 - One of Hitchcock's first films, he brilliantly depicts the struggle between the rising industrial bourgeoisie and the old British aristocracy, full of noblesse oblige for their peasant dependants.\n\nFilms On Labour And Big Business\n\n9-to-5 - Dolly Parton, Lilly Tomlin, and Jane Fonda are secretaries who unite to throw off corporate patriarchy in the persona of evil boss, Dabney Coleman. Check out the fantasy dope-smoking scene.\n\nAgitator, The (1944) A British film about a socialist who inherits the ownership of a major ﬁrm and begins wrestling with his beliefs.\n\nAlien, Aliens and Aliens Ill An underlying message in this series, especially in Aliens, seems to be that unrestrained capitalism is monopolistic, deceptive, and inhuman, often with horrifying consequences. The ﬁlm's Company men, along for want to bring back live specimens of Alien for use as biological weapons. There's a strong implication that the Company is ready to sacrifice individuals, whole communities, and ultimately human civilization, to the proft motive. At one point one of the humans says of the aliens that \"at least they don't fuck each other over for a percentage.\" Doesn't paint a pleasant picture of the military as unwitting cannon fodder, either. It does, however, have a strong, intelligent, active female lead whose match can only be found in Sarah Connor's Terminator 2 performance.\n\nAmerican Dream (1990, Barbara Kopple) Kopple's earlier 1976 documentary about striking Kentucky coal miners, Harlan County, U.S.A., might seem a more obvious choice. But American Dream speaks directly to the era of downsizing, and the waning power and focus of labour unions. During the long, painful strike at the Hormel meatpacking plant in Austin, Minn., we realize the union members are ﬁghting each other while the employers hold all the cards.\" Review by Roger Ebert, in Mother Jones,1996\"\n\nBlue Collar (1978, Paul Schrader) The ending is purposely didactic, but the trip there delves into racial and union politics at a depth seldom matched before or since.\" Review by John Sayles, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nBusiness as Usual - A British drama about a woman ﬁred for protesting sexual harassment, who inspires a nation—wide strike that successfully gets her reappointed. Along the way it portrays the failures of the labour movement as the result of collaboration, and is sympathetic to the Labour Party's Militant Tendency.\n\nCarry On at Your Convenience (1971) This is the tale of industrial strife at WC Boggs' Lavatory factory. Vic Spanner is the union representative who calls a strike at the drop of a hat; eventually everyone has to get fed up with him.\n\nA Christmas Carol -— This is certainly generally done as a parable about the need for the wealthy employer to be generous and paternalistic, rather than as a criticism of systemic inequality, but the 1951 Alistair Sim version shows the Leftist nature of the parable very clearly - Christmas Present with Ignorance and Want under his robe!\n\nEight Men Out - The loose history, directed by John Sayles, of the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal. The players received a pittance and turned to the only source of financial security they could find, the bookies. With stunning performance by John Cusack as the only player who refuses to go along, and a cameo by Studs Terkel.\n\nF.l.S.T. - Sly Stallone plays a young truck driver who organizes a truckers union, gets heavily indebted to Mafia guns in his rise to power, and then (dumb, dumb) tries to distance himself from the Mob. Loosely based on Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters, is very sympathetic to the difficulties of workers against armed company goons.\n\nForce of Evil (Abraham Polonsky, 1948) John Garfield, as a gambling syndicate lawyer, is pitted against his brother who runs a small, independent bookmaking operation. Racketeering is portrayed as a form of monopoly capitalism. (Steve Press)\n\nThe Funeral (Abel Ferrara, 1996) Christopher Walken and Chris Penn, gangster brothers involved in labour racketeering, are arranging the funeral of a third brother who had been developing leftist sympathies. (Steve Press)\n\nThe Garmet Jungle (Vincent Sherman, 1957) Robert Loggia as an ILGWU organizer trying to get a contract for workers at a clothing factory owned by Lee J. Cobb, who has hired a vicious union-busting outfit. This is one of a relatively small number of American films that is explicitly pro—union. —Steve Press\n\nGerminal is the story of a group of coal miners in late 19th century France, and to me it had some similarities to \"The Grapes of Wrath\", even though the setting was different.\n\nGrosse Pointe Blank (George Armitage, 1997). Though a case can perhaps be made that a running gag in this film, Dan Aykroyd's attempt to form a union of hit men, underscores the film's portrayal of professional killers as the hired help of the ruling class, that argument is undercut by protagonist John Cusack's anti-union position. The real left-wing content of this ﬁlm is the subverting of the product placement trend in movies and the solidarity with the Detroit newspaper strike by placing a \"No News or Free Press Wanted\" sign in a storefront window. - Steve Press\n\nLast Exit to Brooklyn (1989) Set in Brooklyn during the 1940s against a backdrop of union corruption and violence. A prostitute falls in love with one of her customers. Also a disturbed man discovers that he's gay.\n\nMatewan - The brutal confrontations between mine operators and striking workers in West Virginia's coal fields during the 1920's. Created by writerl director John Sayles in this stunning drama of diverse people united by a common goal (132 min.)\n\nMelvin and Howard (1980, Jonathan Demme) The Odyssey of the American working stiff. Media—driven dreams, divorce, restlessness, serial employment--like a wake-up call for the '80s.\" Review by John Sayles, in Mother Jones, 199 \"\n\nModern Times — Charlie Chaplin's classic take on the exploitation of the worker.\n\nNorma Rae - This 1975 classic of labour and feminist history tells the story of Norma Rae's struggle to organize her fellow textile workers in a small town in the South. Sally Field in Oscar winning performance, based on a true story.\n\nOn the Waterfront - This hard-hitting drama about corruption in the Longshoremen's Union stands as a major achievement in American film. Without losing any of its dramatic force, it tackles complex social, political and personal issues. The implicit support for those who testiﬁed before the HUAC gives thisMcCarthy-era film a disturbing edge. (108 min.)\n\nRiff-Raff - (1991, Ken Loach) - British socialist director Ken Loach takes you on a tour of a building site during the Thatcher era. The workers are exploited and underpaid; unions not permitted; conditions in which the men work are extremely hazardous. After one of the \"mates\" is killed because of unsafe equipment the workers strike back. The legacy of Thatcherism and the inept Labour Party seen through the eyes of the multi- ethnic crew at a construction site.\" Review by John Sayles, in Mother Jones 1996\" Riff Raff, a British Film, provides an excellent portrayal of abuse of workers on a construction site in London (it appearsto be London at least). Among other things, it is explicitly critical of Thacherite polices in Britain.\n\nRoger & Me (1989, Michael Moore) - This surprisingly successful film was a populist thumb in the eye of General Motors. Wearing a baseball cap and dingy windbreaker, Moore elbowed his way into GM offices and stockholder meetings, and documented what he considered the company's rape of his hometown ofFlint, Mich. Yes, the film took cheap shots--but it took them openly and gleefully, and that was part of the fun. \"Review by Roger Ebert, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nSalt of the Earth - LAB Tells the story of a New Mexico zinc miner's strike that was taken over by the wives of the miners when they were prohibited from picketing. Most of the ﬁlm crew was black listed in Hollywood in 1954 for doing this film. This movie remains a stirring demand for worker unity and sexualequality. (94 min.)\n\nA Taxing Woman (1987, Juzo ltami) - The individual's relationship to the group and to the state in modern Japan, played out in a duel between a love-hotel franchiser and a tax investigator. How many movies make you want to hang with an IRS agent? \" Review by John Sayles, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nThieves’ Highway (Jules Dassin, 1949) - Richard Conte is a truck driver who takes on crooked wholesaler Lee J. Cobb, who has been playing the drivers off against each other. - Steve Press\n\nTotal Recall - Arnold Schwarzenegger is a brainwashed Martian cop on the run, or maybe just a tripping Earth-bound worker on holiday. In any case, a corporate fascist government is exploiting workers on Mars and something's got to be done about it.\n\nThe Triangle Shirt Factory Fire Scandal - LAB Real-life drama of the tragic sweatshop ﬁre in 1911 New York that awakened public awareness, as seen through the eyes of four women that worked there. Starring Stephanie Zimbalist, David Dukes and Tovah Feldshuh. (98 min.)\n\nTucker: The Man and His Dream - is the true story of Preston Tucker, a brilliant automobile designer of the 1940s who overcame extraordinary obstacles to realize a lifetime dream- the manufacture of his own \"car of tomorrow, today.\" Instead of embracing the higher standards and innovative features advocated by Tucker, Detroit manufacturers forced him out of business. Although his dreams were crushed by big business during his lifetime, Tucker's extraordinary vision made him immortal. (111 min.)\n\nUnion Maids - A documentary about three women in the Communist Party who organized in the Back-of-the-Yards meatpacking district of Chicago in the 1930s. DSA's own Vickie Starr stars as \"Stella Nowickie\".\n\nOut of Control - A 1990 documentary which combines first hand experiences of workers and industry experts to explain the deterioration of worker safety in the petrochemical industry (30 min.) [OCAW Visual Productions, PO Box 2812, Denver, CO 80201]\n\nWall Street — The archetypal ﬁlm of 80's corporate greed, graft and decadence.\n\nPeace, Imperialism And The Third World\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930) — A classic pacifist tale set in WI. America's Defense Monitor. Over 200 half-hour episodes on military related subjects that challenge the insanity of U.S. military policy. These programs are a staple in college classrooms and over 100 PBS and cable systems around the country.\n\nApocalypse Now — Based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, about a rogue general in Vietnam driven crazy by the war.\n\nThe Ballad of Gregorio Cortez (1982, Robert M. Young) A late skirmish in the so-called Mexican War. The oppressor's need to demonize the oppressed has seldom been better realized.\"Review by John Sayles, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nBattle of Algiers - This 1962 film is widely considered the best radical ﬁlm ever made. Directed by Pontecorvo in cinema verite, documentary style, it chronicles the Algerian war against French colonialism. French with English subtitles. There are two versions, one is about 150 min., the other about 210 min.\n\nBilly Jack (1971) - Have your cake and eat it too: Billy Jack is a very serious pacifist, a Gandhian...until the racist jerks and ruling class push him a little too far. They he has to break out the whup-ass. \"At times a slightly cheesy story, but nonetheless powerful. Packed with themes that are little dated. Seems to take on almost every single issue that Left Wing folks care about. Followed by 2 sequels: The Trial of Billy Jack and Billy Jack Goes to Washington. The latter of these two sequels is supposed to have been suppressed by the powers that be, since it wassupposed to have really exposed the system of corporate contribution to government. A very difficult film to find — it's never had a mainstream video release and the original 35MM master may be lost forever - leaving only 16MM black and white prints of dubious quality.\" — Jherek Carnelian\n\nBraveheart (1995) - Award-winning story of the medieval Scottish struggle against British imperialism.\n\nBreaker Morant — Edward Woodward plays a soldier commanding a squad of Australian fighting for Britain during South Africa's Boer War. Explores the brutality and corruption of the British colonial struggle.\n\nCamp de Thiaroye - Senegalese film about African soldiers forced by the French to fight on front lines in Europe against Hitler. Takes place mostly in a holding camp following the Allied Victory. Also, see Sembene's \"Black Girl,\" about a Senegalese woman who leaves Dakar to be a nanny for her French employers, is exploited and learns the true nature of black-white neo-imperialist relations.\n\nComing Home (1978) - Jane Fonda and Jon Voight in one of the first post- Vietnam films about Vietnam vets.\n\nDades Kaden - by Akira Kurosawa, shows the devastation left by WWll in Japanese town.\n\nDear America: Letters Home From Vietnam (1987, Bill Couturie) - Couturie takes a simple idea--matching letters from soldiers in Vietnam with images of the war-—and creates a powerful yet surprisingly subtle film. Couturie screened the entire archive of NBC News war footage, and in many cases matches letter writers with TV, film, home movies, and photographs of them at play, in action, wounded, and dead.\"Review by Roger Ebert, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nDr. Strangelove - The Kennedy-era classic that spoofs the Cold War in a story about a mad American general who blows up the world. Brilliant performances by Peter Sellers in three or four roles.\n\nEl Norte - (1983, Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas) - Beginning in the remote mountain jungles of Guatemala, this extraordinary odyssey focuses on two young people seeking a better life as their world begins to crumble. When their mother is abducted by soldiers and their father killed,Enrique and Rosa are forced to set out for the \"promised land\" of the noith- \"el norte\"-The U.S. They must travel dangerous roads and cross heavily patrolled boarders.

(141 min.)\n\nFat Man and Little Boy - Paul Newman stars in this movie about the development and deployment of the atomic bomb.\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls (1943) - Hemingway's tale of the Spanish Civil War. Gandhi - Ben Kingsley won an Oscar for this portrayal. (188 min.)\n\nGood Morning Vietnam - Based on a true story, Robin Williams plays a very funny disk jockey who got very popular in Vietnam and then got booted out.\n\nHidden Agenda (1990, Ken Loach) - Loach's films are always, in one way or another, political. This one is based on the Stalker Affair, a scandal involving a senior British police official (Brian Cox) who is investigating a shooting by security forces and gets reassigned after he discovers the killing was unjustified. Set in Northern Ireland, Hidden Agenda argues that a right-wing cabal successfully plotted a \"dirty tricks\" campaign against Prime Minister Harold Wilson.\"Review by Roger Ebert, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nHow I See The World, by Albert Einstein - Einstein opposed World War One, and was a socialist.\n\nI Am Cuba - made by Russian film-makers in the early '60s and explores the communist uprising in Cuba. The cinematography is mind boggling and the ﬁlm is extremely moving.\n\nKilling Fields, The - Based on a true story of friendship between an American and Cambodian covering the fall of Cambodia at the end of the Vietnam War. The Cambodian was captured by the Khmer Rouge and then escapes to freedom. (135 min.)\n\nLand and Freedom - by Ken Loach about an unemployed man in Liverpool who goes to ﬁght in the spanish civil War against Franco.\n\nLa Hora de los Hornos (The Hour of the Furnaces) - This semi-documentary was made by Argentinian revolutionaries Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino in 1968. Designed specifically to make the audience participants instead of just spectators, this film not only called for political revolution in the name of Marx, Che, and others, it also called for a cinematic revolution. The two co-wrote \"Towards a Third Cinema,\" a manifesto criticizing the American \"first cinema\" approach to ﬁlm-making. Not just revolutionary propaganda (although it contains a great deal of that), the film examines the American/European imperialism and neocolonialism which caused widespread poverty and class distinctions across Argentina and the whole continent of South America.\n\nMissing — (1982, Constantin Costa-Gavras) - Based on the true story of the disappearance of an American writer, Charles Horman, after the Pinochet coup in Chile. Focuses on the political transformation of Charles's father Ed Horman, a New York businessman who arrives in Chile to try to find his son. Initially trusting his advice from the U.S. embassy, Ed Harman comes to recognize the complicity of the United States in the coup. Like Reds, it reinforces the idea that if an American wasn't present it didn't really happen, but explores sharp implications about U. S. imperialism. Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek get to the point. \"Review by John Sayles, in Mother Jones, 1996\" Mission, The - Based on a true story, about Jesuits in Amazon in the 1600s who solidarize with their converts and lead an unsuccessful Indian revolt against the conquistadors.\n\nMoses (1994) - Ben Kingsley leads the people of Israel out of bondage.\n\nMy Brilliant Career Movie about an Australian woman discovering herself in the outback.\n\nOn the Beach A chillingly depressing depiction of the final survivors of a nuclear war, waiting for the end.\n\nThe Panama Deception, \"a somewhat stilted but nonetheless informative documentary by leftist producers about the events leading up to the US invasion of Panama. An indictment of press control and neo-imperialism.\" - Ronald Brackett\n\nPaths of Glory (1957) Directed by Stanley Kubrick. When soldiers are sent on a suicide mission and fail, their ambitious General chooses from the survivors at random to face court-martial. Kirk Douglas is the soldier-lawyer defending his comrades.\n\nPlatoon (1986, Oliver Stone). Platoon helped vets feel acknowledged, which The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, or The Green Berets never did.\n\nRed Sorghum - Traditional Chinese class and sex relations, and the struggle against the Japanese imperialist aggression against China.\n\nSalvador - James Woods brilliantly portrays the outspoken American photojournalist Richard Boyle in 1980 during the civil war in El Salvador. The real life Boyle collaborated with director Oliver Stone to create a movie which is thrilling, terrifying, suspenseful and impossible to forget. This is an exceptionally powerfulﬁlm which will promote intense discussion. (123 min.)\n\nSugarcane Alley, \"takes place in Martinique during the 1930's, is an excellent portrayal of French imperial possessions. A black boy is so smart that he gets into a white school. The movie talks about racism, mistreatment of workers and, of course colonialism.\" - Ronald Brackett\n\nSwimming to Cambodia - Brilliant one-man performance art piece by Spalding Gray about his participation in the making of The Killing Fields, and dissects American foreign policy along the way.\n\nTen Commandments The - Charlton Heston leads the chosen people out of slavery to the land of milk and honey.\n\nTestament (1983, Lynne Littman) Many ﬁlms have portrayed life after a nuclear war, but none were so shattering as this. Jane Alexander stars as a suburban mother trying to hold her family together in the aftermath of the Bomb. We never see a mushroom cloud or know who started the war. What we see is even more affecting: A speculation about how communities of survivors might organize after the devastation.\"Review by Roger Ebert, in Mother Jones, 1996\"\n\nUnder Fire with Nick Nolte, Joanna Cassady and Gene Hackman, on the U.S. presence in the war in Nicaragua.\n\nUtu (1983)...Anti-imperialist film. The colonial British army pillages Maori villages. A Maori corporal who quits the army to fight against it seeks revenge. Simplistic, but the ﬁlm does not try to gloss over the anger of Maori by arming them with Western values.\n\nWar Games (Matthew Broderick , Ally Sheedy, Dabney Coleman - 1983) High school computer wizard David Lightman (Broderick) breaks into computer not knowing it belongs to the United States Air Force. Lightman sets a Soviet suprise nuclear attack simulation as a joke. It backfired. Lightman escapes from Federal custody to ﬁnd Dr. Stephen Falken, an elusive and enigmatic computer expert, for he alone knows what Joshua (USAF's computer) can do.\n\nYear of Living Dangerously - Follows a journalist in the midst of Suharto's bloody coup to overthrow the democratically elected, leftist Indonesian government of Sukarno.\n\nRacism and anti-racism\n\nWorld Apart - Based on a true story, Barbara Hershey is arrested for her anti-apartheid activities, leaving her troubled teenage daughter to cope with the tumult. (112 min.)\n\nAlien Nation - Aliens land in L.A. and take the place of blacks and Latinos in the underclass. An alien cop and a human cop team up against alien drug pushers exploiting the alien ghetto.\n\nBad Day at Black Rock (John Sturges,1955) Set just after WW ll. Spencer Tracy plays a one-armed man who arrives in a small western town to deliver a medal to the father of a Japanese-American solder who served with him and was killed in Europe. He is met by an extremely hostile populace, led by RobertRyan, and hiding a racially based murder of the father.
