        "text": "Summary\n\nThe platoon leader Klaus Schneider is wounded in the First World War and admitted to a military hospital. The doctor there, Dr. Bettelheim, treats Schneider’s severe head injury and finds out that Schneider has clairvoyant abilities. After the war, Schneider meets his former superior, Captain Nowotny, again. Nowotny provided entertainment for the soldiers during the war by running a traveling theater at the front. He now took up with Schneider and wants to make him famous. He suggests him to change his name, because people can’t do anything with Klaus Schneider. His name is changed to Jan Erik Hanussen and the new Hanussen attaches importance to his Danish descent! Nowotny turns Hanussen into a vaudeville star.\n\nHe attracted great attention when he predicted the sinking of a cruise ship. Hanussen was arrested and charged with imposture. Since he could not be proven guilty of the charges, he was acquitted. He moves to Berlin with Nowotny and his girlfriend Wally. There he moves in the circles of the upper ten thousand. Although Hanussen is Jewish, he nevertheless cozies up to the National Socialists. In these circles, people like to associate with him; his Jewish ancestry is not known at first.\n\nHanussen has become rich in the meantime. He is quite generous in social circles and supports the Nazis in the election campaign. He predicts the election victory of Adolf Hitler and claims that he will become the new Chancellor of the Reich. Hanussen was to be proved right. But was it a prediction, or was it simply coincidence? 1933, the Nazis come to power. Hanussen is by now firmly entrenched in the leadership of the SA. He probably learned from this source that the Nazis were planning to set fire to the Reichstag. Hanussen makes this public as well. A few days later, the Reichstag burns. His friends Nowotny and Wally are horrified. Hanussen had always been careful never to express himself politically in public.\n\nBut Hanussen is now the big star and is celebrated by the tabloid press. For the SA leaders, however, he is now a traitor and is arrested. It also became known that Hanussen was a Jew. Many Germans had taken Hanussen for a National Socialist and suddenly he was an enemy of the people. The SA henchmen murdered him in the night from March 24 to 25, 1933.\n\nProduction History\n\nThe film is a Hungarian-Austrian-German co-production. From Germany, the film was financed by Artur Brauner‘s CCC-Filmkunst and ZDF. The plot largely corresponds to the historical facts, but the person of Jan Erik Hanussen is portrayed here much more positively than he was in reality. Above all, Klaus Maria Brandauer provides this positive person with his portrayal. Hanussen was in reality a crook, swindler and as he was called at the time, a cutthroat. He cheated countless people out of their money. He was murdered in reality because of an SA internal intrigue, in which he himself was only marginally involved. The Encyclopedia of International Film says: “A debatable contribution to the important subject of the power situations of the 20th century.”\n\nAbout the historical figure Jan Erik Hanussen\n\nHerschel Chajm Steinschneider, which was his real name, was born on June 2, 1889 in Vienna and grew up in very poor circumstances. He began his working years as a society reporter in Vienna. He very quickly became criminal in his job. He blackmailed well-heeled people by threatening to publish a scandalous story in the tabloids and made himself well paid for these threats. He exposed a “psychic” by publishing his tricks in the press as well. Later he used these tricks himself. In 1928, he was indicted in Leitmeritz (Sudetenland) for a hundred counts of fraud. He was acquitted after more than two years. The reason given by the court was that only a feeble-minded person would believe a fortune teller. He soon worked at the circus as an acrobat and magician, or even as a vaudeville artist.\n\nLater, he engaged in occultism as well as fortune-telling and performed fakir tricks. From 1930 Hanussen joined the National Socialists. He was especially popular among the SA leadership. He financed the “nice life” of the SA superiors by lending money. One of his biggest debtors was a certain Count Helldorf, at that time a high officer of the SA. He probably gave the order to kill Hanussen to get rid of his high debts to Hanussen. The murder itself was carried out by the SA henchmen Karl Ernst, Wilhelm Ohst, Kurt Egger and Rudolf Steinle. This is historically attested. Steinle later declared in an interrogation by the Gestapo that he had fired the fatal shots at Hanussen in the night of March 24-25, 1933.\n\nAbout Klaus Maria Brandauer\n\nHis real name is Klaus Georg Steng and he was born on June 22, 1943 in Bad Aussee in Styria. He later adopted his mother’s first and maiden name, Maria Brandauer, as his stage name. Brandauer first lived with his grandparents in Altaussee and later with his parents in Grenzach-Wyhlen, a German border town with Switzerland. After graduating from high school, he studied music and performing arts in Stuttgart. In 1963 he made his debut at the Landestheater in Tübingen in a play by William Shakespeare, Measure for Measure. He then went to Vienna and performed at the Theater in der Josefstadt. In 1970 he became a permanent ensemble member of the Vienna Burgtheater. Brandauer was and is a theater actor. For television he very often played in theater recordings or corresponding television adaptations.\n\nHowever, he also appeared from time to time in individual episodes of various well-known television series. Also for cinema, his roles were mostly set on film biographies of famous people. They determine most of his film work. Brandauer became known as a film actor through the 1981 film “Mephisto” directed by István Szábo. He also starred in two other films by the director, “Oberst Redl” in 1985 and “Hanussen” in 1988. In 1983, Brandauer starred as the villain Maximilian Largo in the James Bond film “Sag niemals nie.” Brandauer received an Oscar nomination for his role in “Jenseits von Afrika“. In 1989, Klaus Maria Brandauer occupied the lead role as Danton in one of the most monumental, expensive and longest films in European film history, “The French Revolution.” The nearly six-hour film gobbled up more than $50 million in production costs. In the further course of his film career, Brandauer again portrayed great personalities. For example, “Rembrandt,” Crown Prince Rudolph, Wilhelm Reich and the failed Hitler assassin Georg Elser.\n\nIn the film biography of the colored U.S. actress Dorothy Dandridge, “Rising Star,” Brandauer played U.S. film director Otto Preminger. In the 2000s, Brandauer devoted himself more to theater again. He also taught as a professor at the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna. In 1962 he married his childhood sweetheart Karin Müller. The marriage lasted until her death after cancer in 1992, and they had a son, Christian. In 2007 Brandauer married his second wife Natalie Krenn. From this marriage comes son Ferdinand. Klaus Maria Brandauer now lives in his birthplace Altaussee in Styria.\n\nAbout Erland Josephson\n\nErland Josephson was born in Stockholm on June 15, 1923. He gained international fame as an actor in most of Ingmar Bergman’s films. Josephson was of Jewish descent and was a grandson of the Swedish painter Ernst Josephson. He began his career as a theater actor at the Student Theater in Stockholm. From 1945 he acted at the theater in Helsingborg. Ingmar Bergman brought him to film as early as 1946. He played a small role in the film “It’s Raining on Our Love.” From 1949 Josephson played at the theater in Gothenburg.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he appeared mainly in motion pictures, especially under director Bergman. Josephson also made a name for himself as a writer. He wrote volumes of poetry, novels, screenplays and plays. In 1978, he was offered the leading role in the film “Jaws ‘,” which would certainly have earned him a lot of money. He turned it down. His comment: “I prefer intellectual battles with Liv Ullmann to battles with sharks.” He continued to act in films by Bergman, his last being “Sarabande” in 2003. Then he fell ill with Parkinson’s disease, which made it impossible for him to continue working on films. He died as a result of the disease on February 25, 2012 in a Stockholm nursing home.\n\nAbout Kárily Eperjes\n\nKárily Eperjes was born on February 17, 1954 in Hegykö (Hungary). Actually, he was supposed to become a Catholic priest, but he decided to become an actor. He attended an acting school in Budapest and after graduating he acted at the Budapest National Theater from 1980. The director Peter Fábry brought him to the film. In 1982 he played his first role in the crime film “Without a Trace”. Under director István Szabó he played in great films like “Hanussen“, “Oberst Redl” and “Abschlussbericht” both alongside Klaus Maria Brandauer. For his role in the film “Eldorado” he was nominated for the European Film Award as best leading actor in 1989.\n\nPress\n\n“A debatable contribution to the important subject of the power situations of our century.”(Lexikon des Internationalen Films)\n\n“The third collaboration between cinematographer Koltai, director Szabó and actor Brandauer condenses “Hanussen” into a cloying colportage consisting of nothing but sharp snapshots that together make up a big lie, a single conundrum whose key has been lost in the coffee houses of this world.” (hardsensations.com)\n\n“In director István Szabó’s 1988 historical drama Hanussen, Klaus Maria Brandauer shines again as Austrian soldier Klaus Schneider, who gains his second sight after being shot in the head during World War I. The third installment of Szabó’s trilogy about German fascism is impressive.” (derekwinnert.com)\n\n“Hanussen may not be Szabo and Brandauer’s finest moment, that would be the incredible Colonel Redl, but it’s still a fascinating story and an intense performance worth seeing.” (bonjourtristesse.net)\n\n“Szabo also makes the character of Hanussen a powerful symbol of the historical changes Germany went through in the period between the two world wars. Hanussen is an absolutely fascinating film.” (moriareviews.com)"
