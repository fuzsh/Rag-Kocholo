        "text": "Even though earlier Hungarian films by Szabo (presented in this program) also\n\nwon international awards, it is a less known fact that they are at least as\n\nvaluable works of art as his later co-productions that reached wider world\n\naudience.\n\nIstván Szabó, one of the great European directors, is first of all famous for\n\nhis films from the ‘80s, made as opulent West German-Hungarian-Austrian\n\nco-productions: Mephisto (1981), Oberst Redl (1985)\n\nand Hanussen (1988).They won numerous prestigious international\n\nawards and caused great interest with the audience. A constant theme from the\n\nauthor’s opus is present in all of these films: destiny of an interesting\n\nindividual who is at first used by a social system (in the first and third film\n\nNazi system and in the second Austro-Hungarian), which allows him certain\n\nprivileges, only to finally be destroyed by it. Younger audiences could be\n\nfamiliar with the equally attractive film, Sunshine (1999) also made as a\n\nco-production between a few countries. The film is a story about the destiny of\n\na Hungarian Jewish family from the last few years of the Austro-Hungarian\n\nmonarchy until the fall of Communist regime in Hungary. In Croatia, it went\n\nstraight to video and television, which says a lot about the change of theatre\n\nscreening policy and not about this film’s value. With this film Szabo won a\n\nGolden Globe for the best director.\n\nEven though earlier Hungarian films by Szabo (presented in this program) also\n\nwon international awards, it is a less known fact that many critics claim that\n\nthey are at least as valuable works of art as the later co-productions that\n\nreached wider world audience. These Hungarian films are in a certain way more\n\nconsistent, because they were made in a system when producers did not care about\n\ntheir commercial success. Also, constant threat of censorship led the author to\n\nbe more inventive in the search for a technique with which to indirectly – which\n\nin film is always a better way, and in those times enabled the escape from\n\nideological condemnation - show his view of life when crucial historical moments\n\nand dramatic social changes break ideals and very often destroy lives of\n\nindividuals.\n\nIn his debut Álmodozások kora (1966), award in Locarno for the best\n\ndebut) that happens to a young generation facing real life.\n\nFor his most personal film, Apa (1967), he shared the Grand prix\n\nin Moscow and in Locarno won the special jury award. In this film he used\n\nautobiographical elements in creation of his main character (played by András\n\nBálint) who investigates the death of his prematurely deceased father.\n\nHe used such strong emotional tension in a different manner in his masterpiece\n\nSzerelmesfilm (1970) which greatly shaped the belief that Hungarian\n\ncinematography of that time was one of the leading in Europe. Complex\n\nrelationships in Hungary were shown as a love story happening in Paris. In 1956,\n\nafter the rebellion in Hungary, a Hungarian and a girl who just emigrated from\n\nHungary, fall in love.\n\nPerhaps his best film,Bizalom (1980) won the Silver Bear\n\nfor the best director in Berlin), is also an unusual love story about two people\n\nat the end of the WW II. Even though they have never seen each other before,\n\nthey have to pretend to be married in order to escape prison. One of Szabo’s\n\nconstant traits is evident here: showing only echoes and consequences of\n\nhorrific events on human psyche, he achieves a more tragic impression than he\n\nwould if he was to visually create those horrors.
