        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nFew musical acts have enjoyed the success and the long run of the legendary band Bon Jovi.\n\nAnd a revealing new documentary series premiering tonight on Hulu tracks the highs and the lows of the Grammy Award-winning band's four decades together.\n\nRecently, Geoff Bennett spoke with front man Jon Bon Jovi about \"Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story.\"\n\nIt's for our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nYes, it's great to have you here.\n\nThis docuseries is a real, honest look at the band's triumphs, its setbacks. What has this experience been like, reliving your past and then considering what it all means for your future?\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nWell, 40 is a milestone. Even if it's only the first 40, 40 years is a long time to have been making music as we have.\n\nSo I wanted to mark this milestone. We were archiving everything, that I didn't realize or a hoarder I have become.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nSo it made it easy for the storytelling.\n\nAnd then about this vocal surgery was not a part of the plan. But this is a couple years in the making, this film. So that just happened. And I'm not afraid to show emotion. It's just that we typically hadn't had the platform for it.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nI love what I do, but it's hard work. It's like anything else. It's your craft, but it's also your passion, and then by being true to who and what you are, which was important early on and to remain true to that, you evolve as a man and as a writer.\n\nAnd people come along for that ride.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nI can't tell you that I could write the book on it, but, in truth, probably our upbringing, where we were from, the time in which we were born, family.\n\nThe band could close the door and say, \"Do you believe what just happened\"?\n\n(Laughter)\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nWell, obviously, it's something that I treasure. He's so many millions of people's hero.\n\nBut growing up 25 miles away from that Jersey Shore scene, where he made it famous, and then Southside Johnny followed up in those footsteps, those were guys that not only I could look up to who were 12 and 13 years older, but they made the impossible seem very possible, because they were, in essence, right outside your window.\n\nAnd now our relationships, of course, are bonded forever, because we have become very close.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nWell, it's not that I couldn't. It was more of a decision that maybe I wouldn't.\n\nI tried everything I could. There was something happening, but a picture couldn't show it to you. When a singer has something like a nodule, it's in essence a pimple on a vocal cord. You can see it visually. I wasn't having that.\n\nWhat I was realizing that one of my vocal cords was atrophying. And after a lot of holistic and praying and anything I could do, including going out on the road to try to beat it into shape, I'd come to the conclusion that I needed to find the right surgeon. And I did.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nThe truth is, I hadn't had to think about that because I have always been in the process of getting to the recovery.\n\nThe new album is proof that the surgery has worked. For me now, the bar is getting back to that two-and-a-half-hours a night, four nights a week. So that's the process that I'm in now.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nWell, everybody wants a right-hand man, if they're lucky enough they have a friend like that.\n\nAnd he had come to see me many years ago. He says: \"I need to be your guitar player.\" When we clicked and hit it off, he became that perfect right-hand man. And, in 2013, he left the band.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nWell, there was a big black hole on that side of the stage, for sure, but there was nothing that was going to hinder me from continuing to write records and go out there and sell out shows.\n\nSorry to say it, but look at the marquee, you know?\n\n(Laughter)\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nBut I think it was the hard work, the joy of doing it. We persevered by writing songs that people could relate to.\n\nAnd I have been on this 40-year journey, that people may have gotten off the ride along the way,but it's been honest and open. And so you can feel yourself in those shoes in different parts of your life the way I have written about them in mine.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nYes, well, one of those songs, \"Livin' on a Prayer,\" classic, one of the best rock melodies ever.\n\nBut when you were writing it, you thought, I'm not so sure about this. Maybe it's a song for a movie soundtrack. How did that song ultimately come to life?\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nWell, it evolved.\n\nWhen we'd written it on that day, it was a very simple chord structure. The melody, the lyric was finished. We knew all of that. But it came to life when the band got in the room and we developed the bass line, and Tico came in playing the drums.\n\nAnd that's when it popped. That's when the key change happened at the end.\n\n(Singing)\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nNo. In truth, Geoff, it wasn't the first single on the album.\n\n\"You Give Love a Bad Name\" was the first single, because that sort of sounded like what was on the radio, what a hit song sounded like. When we wrote that, when we were like, I think we got one here. \"Prayer\" was so different. And it was the second single, and, of course, the billions of steams and all that stuff later.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nI remember, when I was a kid, my mom said, find your influences' influences.\n\nAnd when we were talking a little bit off camera, somebody had said to me during the course of this promo tour, what's the first music you remember hearing? And the thing that came to mind initially was Beatles and Gene Autry.\n\nJon Bon Jovi:\n\nSo there was always a little bit of a country thing that I was aware of as a little boy. But it wasn't what drew me to music.\n\nWhat draws me to the city is, I jokingly say, these are my people. The — it's a songwriters community. Every guy that's pumping gas is a great songwriter. And they're still making a living doing it."
