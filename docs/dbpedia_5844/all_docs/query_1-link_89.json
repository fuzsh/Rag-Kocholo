From music to art installations, and from literature to the Internet, these various artistic expressions, both individually and in relation to cinema, help us better understand and experience the world around us.",

        "text": "One of the first programs of its kind at a liberal arts college, the Cinema Studies Program introduces students to the craft, history and cultural meaning of film, television, and digital media. Students work with faculty mentors and with their peers to make nonfiction, animation, experimental and live-action fiction films of professional quality, many of which have screened at leading festivals. They also study the history and theory of cinema within a campus community that prizes public engagement with pressing questions of history and contemporary culture. Integrating the creative and critical study of media, the Cinema Studies Program offers our majors the technical training to make first-rate films and the intellectual formation to understand why they matter.\n\nA Film Studio as Your Classroom\n\nThe Cinema Studies Program resides above the Apollo Theater in the Danny DeVito & Rhea Perlman Center for Media Education and Production. With fully equipped sound stages, green screens, animation rooms, editing suites and classrooms, the Apollo Film Labs is the creative and social hub for our majors. Housed in a state-of-the-art complex within a small liberal arts setting, the Cinema Studies Program has helped launch the careers of alumni now working for media organizations including HBO, CNN, PBS, Sony, Bad Robot and Topple. With the close support of faculty mentors, Oberlin’s film majors build the collaborative relationships that sustain their careers as writers, directors, producers, animators, teachers and journalists."
