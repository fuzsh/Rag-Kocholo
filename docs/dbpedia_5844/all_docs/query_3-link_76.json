        "text": "Roxy Music - 'Dance Away'\n\nRoxy Music - Dance Away\n\nRead more: Roxy Music's 10 greatest ever songs\n\nBryan Ferry originally wrote this for his 1977 solo album In Your Mind and his 1978 follow-up The Bride Stripped Bare, but it was finally included on the next Roxy collection.\n\nIt became one of Roxy Music’s biggest-ever hits. Despite not reaching number one, it was one of the ten best-selling singles of 1979 in the UK.\n\nAs ever, Bryan Ferry oozed cool with this song, while bridging the gap between their glam rock past and new wave future.\n\nThe Osmonds - 'Crazy Horses'\n\nThe Osmonds - Crazy Horses\n\nDespite being known as a schmaltzy boyband, The Osmonds released this surprisingly brilliant hard rock track in 1972.\n\nMerrill Osmond said: “All our songs were chosen for us by the record company. But now, having been successful, we wanted to freak out and make our own music.”\n\nThe record company were initially sceptical, but relented after it was a hit in the UK, where it was ironically their breakthrough song, but was followed up by more pop ballads. Donny did not have a line in the song, as his voice was in the middle of changing due to puberty.\n\nGlen Campbell - 'Rhinestone Cowboy'\n\nGlen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy (Official Music Video)\n\nLarry Weiss first recorded this song, but it was Glen Campbell's cover a year later that became a huge hit.\n\nCampbell first heard the song at a party, and identified with the song's subject: survival and making it, particularly when the chips are down.\n\nIt proved to be a big comeback for Campbell, and gave him one of the decade's most enduring country hits.\n\nThe Clash - 'London Calling'\n\nThe Clash - London Calling (Official Video)\n\nReleased right at the end of the decade in December 1979, this apocalyptic and politically charged track showcased the Clash's post-punk style.\n\nThe lyrics were about the concern felt by Joe Strummer about world events that year, referring to \"a nuclear error\" at Three Mile Island.\n\nHe said: \"We felt that we were struggling about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And there was no one there to help us.\"\n\nThe Temptations - 'Papa Was a Rollin' Stone'\n\nThe Temptations Papa Was A Rolling Stone 1972 Single Version\n\nWritten by Motown's Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong in 1971, this was actually first recorded by Motown act The Undisputed Truth.\n\nThe 25 greatest Motown songs of all time, ranked\n\nHowever, the most famous version was by The Temptations, who transformed it into a 12-minute epic, and remains one of the greatest soul anthems of all time.\n\nThe song details the story of the singer's unreliable father, who was a philanderer. When he dies, the mother opens up about him, telling the kids about his laziness and womanizing ways.\n\nWild Cherry - 'Play That Funky Music'\n\nWild Cherry - Play That Funky Music\n\nOne of the greatest funk-rock songs of all time, this proved to be a one-hit wonder for Ohio band Wild Cherry, but what a hit.\n\nCrossing the genres of funk, disco and rock, this incredibly catchy song sold over 2.5 million copies in the US alone in 1976.\n\nSupertramp - 'The Logical Song'\n\nSupertramp - The Logical Song (Official 4K Video)\n\nSupertramp’s biggest hit, it was also the lead single from their biggest album Breakfast in America, and was one of the best soft rock tunes of the era.\n\nRoger Hodgson composed the song from an autobiographical point of view, from his experience of being sent away to boarding school for ten years.\n\nBee Gees - 'Night Fever'\n\nBee Gees - Night Fever (Official Video)\n\nFirst appearing on the soundtrack to the film Saturday Night Fever, this single reached the top spot of the UK Singles Chart where it stayed for two weeks, and is one of the greatest-ever disco songs.\n\nThe 20 greatest Bee Gees songs of all time, ranked\n\nProducer Robert Stigwood wanted to call the film Saturday Night, but singer Robin Gibb didn't like the title. Stigwood liked the title Night Fever but was wary of marketing a movie with that name, so there was a compromise.\n\nOlivia Newton-John - 'Hopelessly Devoted to You'\n\nGREASE | \"Hopelessly Devoted\" Clip | Paramount Movies\n\nThis song was not originally in the Grease stage musical, but halfway through shooting the movie, Olivia Newton-John’s contractually-entitled vocal solo had still not been written.\n\nJohn Farrar, her personal producer, wrote the song and submitted it to the film’s production team.\n\nThough reluctant at first, they eventually approved it, and shooting took place after the rest of the film had finished. It was nominated for an Oscar, but lost out to Donna Summer’s ‘Last Dance’.\n\nRoberta Flack - 'Killing Me Softly With His Song'\n\nROBERTA FLACK KILLING ME SOFTLY LEGENDADO EM PORTUGUÊS BR\n\nThis ballad was written by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel, in collaboration with Lori Lieberman after she was inspired by a Don McLean gig in 1971.\n\nThe Story of... 'Killing Me Softly With His Song' by Roberta Flack\n\nLieberman released her version in 1972, but it was Roberta Flack's soulful cover which became an instant classic. It was later a massive single for Fugees in 1995.\n\nPink Floyd - 'Comfortably Numb'\n\nComfortably Numb\n\nThis is taken from Pink Floyd’s concept album The Wall, which is about Pink, an embittered and alienated rock star.\n\nThis song compares Pink’s memories of being feverishly ill as a child with his feeling nothing at all in adulthood. The lyrics feature a cut between a doctor treating the adult Pink (verses, sung by Waters) and Pink’s inner monologue (chorus, sung by Gilmour).\n\nScissor Sisters later released a disco-inspired cover version in 2004.\n\nHarry Chapin - 'Cat's in the Cradle'\n\nHarry Chapin - Cats in the Cradle\n\nThis song tells of a father and son who can’t schedule time to be with each other, and it serves as a warning against putting one’s career before family.\n\nIts lyrics began as a poem written by Harry’s wife, Sandra Gaston. It was inspired by the awkward relationship between her first husband, James Cashmore, and his father, a politician.\n\nHarry also said the song was about his own relationship with his son, Josh, admitting, “Frankly, this song scares me to death.” Rock band Ugly Kid Joe scored a hit with a cover version in 1992.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd - 'Freebird'\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd - Free Bird\n\nRunning at over nine minutes in length, for two years after Allen Collins wrote the initial chords, singer Ronnie Van Zant insisted that there were too many for him to create a melody.\n\nAfter Collins played the unused sequence at rehearsal one day, Van Zant asked him to repeat it, then wrote out the melody and lyrics in four minutes.\n\nIt has become something of a humorous tradition for audience members at concerts to shout ‘Free Bird’ as a request to hear the song, regardless of the performer or style of music.\n\nBruce Springsteen - 'Born to Run'\n\nBruce Springsteen - Born to Run (Official Music Video)\n\nRead more: Bruce Springsteen's 10 greatest songs ever\n\nA total karaoke staple, this is a peak Bruce power ballad. The uplifting track makes anyone who hears it want to shake off their negative vibes and make something of themselves.\n\nIn late 1973, while on the road in Tennessee, Bruce woke up with the title 'Born to Run', which he wrote down.

It's become a massive, massive track and an anthem to people who want to be hedonistic. It was kind of a stroke of genius from Freddie.\"\n\nDavid Bowie - 'Life on Mars?'\n\nDavid Bowie – Life On Mars?
