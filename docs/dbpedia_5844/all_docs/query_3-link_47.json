        "text": "The purpose of the Music Performance Certificate is to acknowledge college-level work in music for those who are not completing the full A.A. degree in music. Upon completion of the certificate, when combined with another associate degree program, students will be prepared to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (rather than a Bachelor of Music) degree, or minor in music, at their transfer institution. Students who are not also enrolled in an Associate program will be prepared to audition at institutions that require a performance audition for admission. The certificate may be used by those students who would like to augment any degree program at the college with serious study in music, or simply to improve performance skills for personal enrichment.\n\nEllen Cogen\n\nApplied Jazz Voice, College Chorale, Chamber Vocal Ensemble, Music Fundamentals, Musical Theater, Music Education\n\nBeginning her musical studies as a classical pianist and cellist, Ellen Cogen began her vocal studies as a senior at the University of Massachusetts, from which she received her BM in Music Theory. She quickly fell in love with vocal art of all kinds, going on to earn her certification to teach vocal/choral music in the public schools, and her Master of Music in Vocal Performance (classical) from the New England Conservatory of Music. As a classical singer, she sang art songs, oratorio, and operatic repertoire, but was particularly drawn to the \"crossover\" style of classical cabaret, performing recitals featuring the music of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg, Benjamin Britten, and other composers of this genre. She became more and more enamored with jazz, and in the past several years, most of her performing has been as a jazz singer, sometimes accompanying herself, or with a variety of ensembles, from trios to big bands. She is the leader of jazz fusion group the Ellen Cogen Ensemble. As an educator, Ellen has taught middle school and high school, and is associate professor of music at Holyoke Community College and a visiting lecturer at Westfield State University. In addition to her choral direction at schools and colleges, she has led many church and community ensembles, and currently serves as director of music at Easthampton Congregational Church. Another love is musical theater, and Ellen has directed many professional, school, and community productions over the years, most recently serving as musical director for Holyoke Community College's production of \"In The Heights.\" She enjoys organizing and performing in tribute concerts and fundraisers, and most recently was organizer/director of the Ella Fitzgerald Centennial Bash (held at HCC and the Log Cabin) and a Joni Mitchell 75th Birthday event at Gateway City Arts. Ellen has played and sung on several recordings, and has recorded three CD's of her own: \"Necessary Mystery\" (original compositions), \"Listen To The Moonlight\" (jazz standards), and \"Chord of Longing\" (an eclectic mix of musical styles ranging from classical to pop, arranged and performed with her duo partner and husband, guitarist John Mason). Ellen lives in Westhampton and has two daughters, Julia and Lily.\n\nDavid Kidwell\n\nOrchestra\n\nConductor and composer David Kidwell has been music director and conductor of the Holyoke Civic Symphony since 1997, serving longer than any other conductor in the orchestra's history. Under his leadership, the orchestra has grown both in size and ability. He has expanded the orchestra's commitment to education with educational concerts, pre-concert talks, and open dress rehearsals. And he has reinforced the orchestra's commitment to new music by commissioning nine new works and performing nearly fifty pieces by living American composers. Kidwell received the prestigious University of Mary Washington Young Alumnus Merit Award in 2004, and Holyoke mayor Alex Morse declared February 25, 2012 to be \"David Kidwell Day.\" In 2011, Kidwell stepped down after 15 years as conductor of the Guilford Festival Orchestra in Vermont, an ensemble known for its performances of both contemporary music and chamber orchestra repertoire. Kidwell has also been Minister of Music at the Edwards Church of Northampton since 2000, leading one of the most accomplished church music programs in Western Massachusetts. Kidwell is an active composer whose works have been performed throughout the United States. Music critic Clifton J. Noble wrote, \"The ways he manipulates the melody, his unerring harmonic sense and perceptive scoring speak with the honest originality that is the hallmark of America's most revered composers.\" He has previously been commissioned by the Litchfield County Children's Chorus (CT), Fairborn St. Luke United Methodist Church (OH), Bowling Green Baptist Church (VA), the Amandala Women's Chorus (CT), the Eagle Pipe Band (VA), the University of Mary Washington (VA), the Edwards Church of Northampton, and the Holyoke Civic Symphony. Kidwell's music has been published by Micropress, Lorenz, and MMB Music. David Kidwell was raised in a music-loving family in Virginia, where he played piano, organ, trumpet, and violin. After musical studies in Virginia and Connecticut, he moved to the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts. He was music director and pianist for the Broadway-style revue \"Le Cabaret\" for six years and assistant conductor of the Pioneer Valley Symphony for five years. Kidwell has music directed over fifty musical and light opera productions by community theatre groups, and he is currently a substitute keyboardist at the Goodspeed Opera House. In 2004 he was music director for the Amherst Leisure Services production of \"The Secret Garden,\" which won first prize in the International Maytime Festival in Dundalk, Ireland.
