That version, however has 12 tracks. This album will appeal to all lovers of movie soundtracks, even though these aren’t TOS (The Original Soundtrack) versions. Also those (slightly) older music lovers and movie goers with a hankering for a bit of nostalgia will want to play this album again and again ad nauseam. If you don’t fall into this category yourself, but live with someone who does and are considering buying this as a present – you have been warned…!\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Nostalgia,\n\nGeoff Love was a well-known dance and TV band leader and friend of Ron Goodwin, whose music he always made a good fist of conducting. This LP is a lot of fun, and I can’t help but smile at the incongruous 60s jazz arrangement in one or two places such as Lawrence of Arabia. Listeners are likely to have soundtrack recordings of their favourites anyway, so theres no harm done. The sound is full, and sounds remarkably fresh. This really is an LO to take the middle aged among us back to bygone days of different musical styles, and say wistfully ‘Oh yes, i remember that..’\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Superb,\n\nI grew up with this. What a fantastic collection of British and American wartime movie themes. The thing is they’re all great tunes in themselves and only because you (may) associate them with the movie might put you off. Don’t be put off – track after track of beautiful music, some stomping, some poignant. Everyone one a winner in my book !\n\none of everyone’s favourites, and indeed very popular at the time, was Geoff Love and his Orchestra playing the Big War Movie Themes (1971). These were all haunting and evocative pieces of classical music and many of them are indelibly written into my memory banks. Recently I decided that I wanted to hear those specific versions again and bought the album on vinyl and sure enough it’s still a great listen.\n\nIt struck me though, that although I had seen a good number of the films featured, that I hadn’t seen them all. Also, I wondered how well these classic movies stand up when watched with modern eyes some 48 years later. So I’ve decided to watch all 12 movies in the order they appear on the album and rate the movie along with it’s historical accuracy and depiction of conflict. With modern offerings like Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Band of Brothers and Fury the benchmark for modern war films, it will be very interesting to see how they stand up."
