        "text": "Personalities and politics (and probably a bunch of other things) aside‚Äì I'm always fascinated by how these guys continually find ways to expand and capitalize on their brand. Maybe more so than any other band/artist in history? (Not sure about that last distinction, but please comment with your counter arguments and examples) Of course what CMG Worldwide (which was founded here in Indiana BTW) have done in managing celebrity name and likeness / brands is amazing. But most of the brands they represent (or all?) are related to deceased celebrities. Whereas KISS has gotten this ball rolling while they're still alive (another point on which I welcome opposing arguments) to be involved in the planning and execution. Can you think of similar \"pre-mortem\" artist/band deals like this? I'm guessing there must be some...? https://lnkd.in/gkeh8iTn\n\nNew Post: The 15 Best Dance Albums of 2023: Staff Picks - https://lnkd.in/dhn3SrBa - Singles may be the lifeblood of the dance world, but albums are its beating heart ‚Äî the projects on which artists offer worldviews, complete statements and the fullest sense of who they are, where they‚Äôre coming from and what they care about. Thus like dancing itself, an album is an intimate experience, especially when you listen closely. And 2023 was an exceptional year for the format: legends returned with refreshed ideas, new acts rose above the fray, newly solo artists defined themselves and altogether a barrage of resonant projects reminded us of the vast territory of sound that the dance/electronic genre covers. While tech house, house and techno continued ruling dancefloors worldwide, it‚Äôs hard to say any one sound defined the top albums of the year. There were throwbacks, there was ambient, there was drum ‚Äòn‚Äô bass, house, IDM, acid, pop dance and more. But the long-player format did give artists a chance to step back from the decks ‚Äî where getting the crowd moving is the perpetual motivating force ‚Äî and get into the studio to explore often softer and more experimental sounds, which might not be right for peaktime (or for radio crossover), but which still are part of the dance DNA. And while the Dance/Electronic Albums chart was largely dominated by old standbys in 2023, the way albums were transformed into the live setting helped contribute to one of the healthiest years for live dance events in recent memory. These are our 15 favorite dance albums of 2023, presented in alphabetical order by artist. - Download: Stupid Simple CMS - https://lnkd.in/g4y9XFgR\n\nNew Post: AWAL‚Äôs Lonny Olinick on Being Music‚Äôs Jack of All Trades: ‚ÄòWe Can Do All of the Things‚Äô - https://lnkd.in/gTS-wAbq - Artist development isn‚Äôt dead, but it sure has changed. Two decades ago, a 20-something jazz musician named Norah Jones became a breakout star for Blue Note Records, a traditional route to stardom when people still bought CDs and social media didn‚Äôt exist. Last year‚Äôs breakout jazz artist, Laufey, cultivated a fan base on TikTok and posts sheet music for her songs online so fans can download it before the recordings come out. To AWAL CEO Lonny Olinick, Laufey‚Äôs success is a sign of the times. The Icelandic singer built an online following by herself, but she needed a team to develop her career and handle marketing and promotion logistics. Her second AWAL album, Bewitched, topped Billboard‚Äôs Jazz Albums and Traditional Jazz Albums charts in September. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing this real inflection point where artists are starting to, with their own teams and then between the team and AWAL, realize that there are no barriers in what can be achieved,‚Äù says Olinick, who earned an MBA from Stanford Business School and worked at consulting firm Bain &amp; Company before joining Kobalt in 2016. Related Paul Hitchman Promoted to COO at AWAL 01/29/2024 Artists such as JVKE, whose ‚ÄúGolden Hour‚Äù reached No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2022, and Mercury Prize winner Little Simz have used AWAL to find success outside of the major-label system. AWAL‚Äôs services-focused approach is becoming the norm as major labels increasingly provide distribution, marketing, promotion, accounting and even financing without needing to own the rights to artists‚Äô recordings as part of standard deals. Sony Music acquired AWAL in 2022 to complement its labels and its distribution business, The Orchard. Universal Music Group is also building its own artist services business, through a revamped Virgin Label Group. A pingpong table that Olinick says ‚Äúwe have artists sign when they‚Äôre in the L.A. office.‚Äù Paradoxically, services-based music companies still have to do many of the same things as traditional labels ‚Äî just with different deals. Only recently, Olinick says, has the 16-year-old company truly met that challenge. ‚ÄúLast year and the year before were probably the first years where we fully realized that vision, where I‚Äôm confident that we can do all of the things that exist in the traditional world.‚Äù Most people in the music industry understand record labels and distributors, but services-based companies are a bit harder to get. How would you describe AWAL to the uninitiated? The most important part of music in my mind is artist development. You\n\nüé∏TODAY IS AUSMUSIC T-SHIRT DAY!üé∏ Do you listen to music?

I'll post the albums I buy in the New Year. I love checking out new bands, so let me know in the comments below if there's any you think I should check out as part of the 12 days. ü•Åüéπüéôüé∑üéªüé∫ Financial times are tough right now so if you aren't able to donate you can do to help musicians receive livable incomes in the modern era: FREE - Play music 24/7 in whatever streaming service you use whether you're listening to it or not. More streams = more money for musicians FREE - Follow artists on their social media accounts, subscribe to their YouTube accounts, watch and interact with their posts. The bigger audience a musician has, the more chance of getting paid sponsorships and brand collaboration. FREE - pre-save new music when musicians announce they're releasing it. Often they'll post about specific links or places where you can pre-save. CHEAP - Buy electronic copies of albums online (eg Bandcamp). Most local and small artists have their albums for $10, which is less than 2 takeaway coffees. Did you know the average payment to a musician per stream is $0.005 and it takes about 2,000 streams for musicians to make the same $10. MORE EXPENSIVE - Buy physical cds/records, buy merch, send musicians a coffee (if they have a coffee account), subscribe to Patreon account, buy tickets and go see them live!

The agreement calls for BMG to be the label home for Cirque‚Äôs catalog of original scores and soundtracks, administer its music publishing and jointly create new music. The first release under the pact is the country-themed Songblazers, out today. Songblazers is Cirque‚Äôs newest production, presented in conjunction with Universal Music Group Nashville, about two characters who go on a journey to find their own path to country music stardom. The soundtrack was produced by Grammy-winning producer Daniel Tashian. The partnership will be led by Cirque du Soleil‚Äôs new music division, Cirque du Soleil Studio, which is tasked with expanding the brand‚Äôs fan base. ‚ÄúThe power of music has long been a force uniting cultures and peoples in Cirque du Soleil productions around the world. As music plays an integral part in our productions, we‚Äôre proud to finally dive into the music industry and explore this new avenue,‚Äù said Anne Belliveau, chief customer experience officer for Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group. ‚ÄúOver the last few years, BMG has brought a fresh vision to the music business, and we look forward to partnering with BMG on a variety of music-related opportunities.‚Äù Marian Wolf, senior vp of music publishing, North America, for BMG added, ‚ÄúCirque du Soleil is one of the most innovative and creative entertainment companies in the world. We are thrilled to be the new publishing and recorded music home for Cirque du Soleil and to collaborate on upcoming new releases. This will provide unparalleled opportunities for BMG‚Äôs diverse roster of artists, songwriters, and catalogs. Together we aim to celebrate and elevate global culture by showcasing diverse music releases and transforming the way global audiences discover new music.‚Äù Cirque‚Äôs catalog includes more than 30 titles including the recordings to such popular Cirque du Soleil productions as Ka, O, Alegria, Mystere, La Nouba, Dralion, Saltimbanco, Zumanity and Quidam. (The deal does not include Love, the Cirque production based on the Beatles catalog; that title remains on Apple/Capitol. Separately, BMG has publishing and recording relationships with Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and the late George Harrison). Cirque‚Äôs catalog has earned more than 250 million career streams in the U.S .and more than 500,000 album equivalents sold in the US alone, according to the company. - #news #business #world -------------------------------------------------- Download: #Google #Font #Tester - https://lnkd.in/gKAZYbVN\n\nNew Post: Which Songwriters Will Benefit From the BMI Sale? - https://lnkd.in/gX6tS-u6 - For years, ASCAP and BMI were seen as the Coke and Pepsi of the performing rights management business ‚Äî two giant entities with complicated formulas that seemed the same from a distance but quite different if you examined them closer. The November agreement to sell BMI to a group of investors led by New Mountain Capital, which was completed Feb. 8., has changed that ‚Äî and the songwriters for whom they compete have already seen it in the marketing. BMI is making the case that a for-profit model will let it invest more aggressively in technology, among other things, while ASCAP pointed out on social media that ‚Äúprivate equity never wrote an iconic love song.‚Äù The Pepsi Challenge seems quaint by comparison. There were always differences between the two ‚Äî ASCAP is governed by members, BMI was owned by its licensees; ASCAP charged a onetime $50 fee to join, while BMI was free, though that changed and now ASCAP is free to join and BMI charges $75. And although it‚Äôs hard to know for certain, this could end up being more of an evolution than a revolution: Nonprofits invest in technology and operations all the time, although it can be tricky, and the music business wasn‚Äôt exactly unsullied by greed before the days of private equity. BMI and ASCAP collect and distribute more money than any other rights organizations in the world, though. So any changes in the way BMI operates ‚Äî let alone whatever changes ASCAP makes in response ‚Äî will reverberate through the entire competitive ecosystem to their less regulated U.S. rivals SESAC and GMR (which invite only the songwriters they want to join); to performing rights societies around the world; and ultimately to everyone who writes, owns or publishes songs. New Mountain Capital wants a return on its investment, so BMI will need to make a profit ‚Äî plus grow. Some of this will presumably come from higher-margin new businesses, including international venture ‚Äî think cooperations or partnerships with societies in India, Africa or the Middle East. (BMI and ASCAP are subject to consent decrees that limit what other businesses they could get into in the U.S.) There‚Äôs already some competition in some of those places from European organizations, though. Presumably, some of the profit is going to have to come from BMI‚Äôs traditional U.S. performing rights operations ‚Äî and that won‚Äôt be easy, according to about a dozen rights organization and music publishing executives I spoke with for this column. (None has any inside knowledge about BMI‚Äôs plans.) Essentially, BMI will need to hold back enough of the money it collects to both cover its operating costs and make a profit on top of that, while paying its songwriters and publishers more than they can get from its rivals. BMI has said a bit about how it plans to do that. In an Oct. 12 le\n\nThank goodness, it's feeling fun again! They say necessity is the mother of invention. I think this resurgence in creativity and personality from pop-land is due to what we are all seeing; that it's really difficult to cut through and get to superstar level these days. You have to work for every ticket purchase, T-shirt or record bought. And those that aren't doing the same old campaign roll outs we've seen a million times before are seeing the benefits, which is very wonderful to see. Charli XCX's campaign specifically has just been a joy to watch. It so clearly comes direct from the artist, and then crucially has been executed incredibly well. A great reminder of what's important‚Ä¶ - A deep understanding of your fans and where they are sat culturally. What's going to make them tick. - Gut instinct, don't overthink it, do it. - Keep things within your control, are you gating access to your most valuable fans? - Surround yourself with people who genuinely care about the work you produce as a team and execute on it. - Consistency of message and brand. **Bonus points for an adaptable meme format for an album cover."
