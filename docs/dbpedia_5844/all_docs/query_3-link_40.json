        "text": "Small scale cultural production has been largely ignored in academic debates regarding the production of popular culture. Despite this, there have been a select number of theorists who have suggested that the study of cultural production on this scale may provide valuable insight for larger debates, including those concerning cultural diversity. Underlying this position is the idea that small scale cultural producers share a distinct ideology which motivates or legitimises their decision to remain on the fringes. For the music industry, this was crystallised by the 1970s punk movement, and its use of independent record labels in its attempt to democratise the music industry. While this and subsequent movements have dissipated, they pioneered an ethos of independent music production that has re-shaped the industry. Through qualitative interviews with members of the independent record label sector of Victoria, this study illustrates the continuing presence of this ethos among independent cultural producers. Furthermore, I argue that the continual development of this ethos has helped independent record labels acquire a position of increased influence in the larger industry.\n\nThis article examines the relationship between the practices of do-it-yourself (DIY) micro-independent record labels in the UK and wider mediated discourses surrounding the music industry. It is suggested that a heightened version of the art versus commerce dichotomy central to rock ideology provides the basis for a number of legitimizing theories through which the aesthetic and industrial conventions of these practitioners are justified and given importance. First, the article suggests that these legitimizing theories serve to narrow the scope of, and draw distinct boundaries around, small-scale cultural production. Second, through a self-conscious critique of globalized corporate media they serve as an engagement with the politics of cultural production and, ultimately, media power. Finally, using two prominent case studies relating to new technology (Arctic Monkeys and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah) the article examines the ways in which discourses relating to DIY cultural production ...\n\nThis was my PhD thesis, completed in 1996 under the supervision of Georgina Born, in the Department of Media and Communication at what was then called Goldsmiths College, at the University of London (now rebranded as Goldsmiths University of London). The original abstract now follows: The thesis is an investigation of the following question: to what extent have the independent record companies associated with the two most important 'movements' in British popular music culture during the last twenty years (punldpost-punk and dance music culture) succeeded in democratising the British music business? Part One introduces the key terms in the question. It provides a definition of democratisation with regard to media production, and outlines some of the factors which might constrain producers who wish to bring about such democratisation in the contemporary cultural industries. It examines the particular, but recently diminished, importance attached to independent cultural production as a means of democratisation in studies of 'post-Fordism', and in popular music history. Part Two focuses on punk and post-punk as long-term institutional and aesthetic challenges to the music industry. The emphasis on access and decentralisation in punk politics is analysed, along with its ambivalence towards mass culture. Contrasting case studies are provided of firms which sought to set up alternative networks of distribution, and those who came to work more closely with major corporations. Their respective aims and achievements are assessed. Part Three analyses the role of small dance music labels in the British music industry since the late 1980s 'acid house' explosion. The cultural politics of dance music are examined, stressing the relatively limited attention paid to issues of production. A general survey of the British dance music industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s is provided, which pays special attention to the repercussions of partnerships between independents and corporations. There follows an analysis of how a particular dance music label acts as a forum for debates about issues such as digital sampling, multiculturalism and anti-racism, and black identity. Part Four provides a comparison of the democratising achievements of the two movements, and draws out some of the implications of the thesis for work in media studies, cultural studies and the sociology of youth subcultures.\n\nThis article investigates the cultural economics of the international indie scene with a special focus on the Seville-based four-piece indie neoflamenco band named Pony Bravo and specifically on the group’s prolific sonic and graphic montage visionary, Daniel Alonso Mallén. Pony Bravo draws on a variety of music traditions, connecting the sound and rhythm of the various marginalized «souths»: U.S. southern roots rock and blues, Andalusian rock, flamenco, African and Jamaican rhythms, etc. As they play with these traditions, the group uses their platform to fight for the right to do so: to borrow, to sample, to quote, to remix, to collage, to recycle the rhythms, melodies, harmonies, lyrics, ideas, and images of those creators and tricksters that came before them. With help from Walter Benjamin´s dichotomy between auratic and nonauratic artforms, this article explores the inflation of subcultural capital in indie music (through fan assimilation of nonauratic knowledge) and the elevation of the auratic live artifact as a reaction by those who would keep that currency in check. Daniel Alonso elevates the auratic moment captured as content within the nonauratic form of the archived online promotional poster. He simultaneously champions the demise of all forms of the nonauratic in his embrace of a sort of cultural capital socialism vis-à-vis creative commons (instead of intellectual property) licensing and his antagonistic stance toward the institutions (the SGAE) and legislation (la ley Sinde) that fight for the protection of national and international artists´ IP rights. Resumen Este artículo investiga la economía cultural de la escena indie internacional con un enfoque especial en la banda de neoflamenco indie con base en Sevilla llamada Pony Bravo y, específicamente, en Daniel Alonso Mallén, cantante de la banda y visionario prolífico del montaje gráfico y sonoro. Pony Bravo se basa en una variedad de tradiciones musicales, conectando el sonido y el ritmo de los distintos «sures» marginados: El blues y el rock de sureño de Estados Unidos, el rock andaluz, el flamenco, los ritmos africano y jamaicano, etc. Mientras juegan con estas tradiciones, el grupo utiliza su plataforma para luchar por el derecho a hacerlo: tomar prestado, samplear, citar, remezclar, collagear, reciclar los ritmos, melodías, armonías, letras, ideas e imágenes de los creadores y embaucadores que los precedieron. Con la ayuda de la dicotomía de Walter Benjamin entre formas de arte auráticas y no auráticas, este artículo explora la inflación del capital subcultural en la música indie (a través de la asimilación de los conocimientos no auráticos) y la elevación del artefacto aurático (el concierto en vivo) como una reacción de quienes querrían controlar esa inflación. Daniel Alonso eleva el momento aurático capturado como contenido dentro de la forma no aurático del cartel promocional archivado en línea. Simultáneamente, aboga por la aniquilación de todas las formas de lo no aurático en su abrazo de una especie de socialismo con respecto al capital cultural a través de las licencias Creative Commons en vez de la propiedad intelectual y su postura antagónica hacia las instituciones (SGAE) y la legislación (la ley Sinde) que luchan por la protección de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de artistas nacionales e internacionales."
