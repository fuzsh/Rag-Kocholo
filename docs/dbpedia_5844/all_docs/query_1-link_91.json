        "text": "Til A’ The Seas Gang DryThree voices and harp (or harpsichord)This is a setting of a text drawn from three Robert Burns poems. Whilst working in a house at Lough Bawn, Co Monaghan, I found the book of Burns' work in the library there. It belonged to the grandmother of the owner and was a beautiful book to hold and open. The texts spoke to me by the total clarity and honesty of what Burns was expressing. The feelings are deep but the words lack verbosity or sentimentality. The music evolved from the mood and atmosphere as I sat in the library and lookied out across the loch and the surrounding forestry. My own ancestors came originally from Co Monaghan and I could hear my father's voice in this melody. Although the part-work in the score is quite intricate the performance needs to reflect this calm and languid scene. The performance in the attached recording is by BellaDonna and the backing is enhanced by the addition of pipes and bass. (more…)TrackAudioScoreTrack 1Cefalonian SunsetStudio compositionThis piece is a response to the wonderful 1994 novel \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\" by Louis de Bernieres - later made into a film by John Madden and featuring Penelope Cruz and Nicolas Cage. The scene is of a beautiful, peaceful and very traditional place ravaged both by a brutal wartime German occupation which was defined by the notorious 'Massacre of the Acqui Division' in 1943, and then by a massive post-war earthquake. The book is a stark statement of it all which was, as is inevitable, somewhat sanitised for its film audience. But both pay touching homage to the people of that amazing place and to the young Italian soldiers who were so pointlessly and cynically murdered. My music focusses on the place itself and its deep underlying calm which endures despite the dreadful events of the 20th century and is basically a chaconne with commentary by mandolin and cello.TrackAudioScoreCefalonian Sunsethttps://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cefalonian-Sunset.mp3Corpus Christi CarolHigh voices a2/3, harp, alto recorders a2, glockenspiel.The most pressing question raised by this text is: 'What is it all about?' It is an early Middle English poem with mixed imagery. Some see Arthurian connections to the Grail story - the Fisher King is a knight who is perpetually wounded but who never dies. When wounded, he sees his kingdom become a wasteland, hence the \"orchard brown\". This is linked to Christian imagery where the \"may\" who kneels by the bed seems to be Mary, with Christ on the bed and \"Corpus Christi written thereon\" a clear reference to the Eucharist. It is a strange, austere and haunting text which draws the listener into its world and takes on a meaning beyond its mere words. It was set by various twentieth century composers, including Britten, Warlock and Birtwistle, and there are also excellent 'cross-over' versions by, among others, Jeff Buckley and the neo-folk band, Fire and Ice. We were rehearsing Patrick Hadley's admirable setting of \"I Sing Of A Maiden\" and this drew me to set this poem as a sequel to it. The music combines archaic elements such as parallel open 5ths with vague, indeterminate tonality. Harp, recorders and glockenspiel give a distant, dream-like quality to the texture. The text is slightly rearranged, with the \"Lully,Lullay\" refrain occurring only at the beginning and end - seeking to add to a sense of architecture in the piece.

(more…)TrackAudioScoreYou Are Eve!High Voices a2/3, piano'You Are Eve' is an unashamedly political song and grew out of my reading Marina Warner's wonderful book, \"Alone Of All Her Sex\". The Roman church, and subsequently the societies built around its prescribed model, used two female characters from Christian mythology to define the status and role of women both in the church and in society and, basically, as a vehicle of repression. Eve equates to sin and temptation - the independent-minded, determined woman who sought knowledge and freedom from servitude - while Mary represents duty, obedience, modesty, gentleness, the boundless giving of love and unattainable purity. History, as they say, is written by the guy who did the hanging, and while Mary progressed through the centuries to eventually become 'Heavenes Quene', Eve was consigned to the role of the wicked temptress who brought about the downfall of man. The struggle of women to break free of the structural sexism in our societies is ongoing and, at times, very messy. In a rather raw way this song sets out the scenario from the viewpoint of Eve and of women who seek to challenge the status quo of centuries. The original text includes one quotation from an anonymous female writer of the C12th, who must have been very brave to write such things. As the accompaniment moves into a baroque-style two-part invention, these words are sung, under the breath, as a kind of chorale.TrackAudioScoreThe Wild CallSolo voice and piano or ensemble.This is a new take on John Masefield's majestic and evocative poem \"Sea Fever\". The phrase \"...the call of the running tide.....is a wild call\" grabbed and inspired me. In setting these words one is always strongly mindful of the sublime \"Sea Fever\" for solo voice and piano by John Ireland. His beautiful and powerful music can never be bettered but I felt able to approach the text in a different time and from a different perspective. Lizzie was able to make the song her own, with a subtle Scottish feel to her vowels that added to the wildness and freedom of the poem.TrackAudioScorehttps://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-Wild-Call.mp3Tha Gaol Agam OrtChamber EnsembleThis instrumental piece is my response to a beautiful, sensitive and empathic little poem by Carol Ann Duffy - released on the day of the Scottish independence referendum result in 2015. It had been a difficult time for the Scottish people with emotions running high and a very strong pull of the heart. The waters had been muddied by Scottish politicians with their own agendas and ambitions and by the arrogant and complacent British government in London. The result was a divisive election which left wounds but didn't resolve much. Little did we then suspect the horrors that were to follow in 2016. It is best for the music and Carol Ann Duffy's words to simply speak for themselves. Click 'more' to read the poem.

In a conversation with a friend I was speaking of my father, a builder, who was never really able to see that being a musician had a real value. After all, he made things. To a good degree he was right, of course - these things are quite complex and often definite a relationship. (\"And what do you do?\" is one my least favourite small talk lines to have to respond to. It often results in \"Oh nice!\" and end of conversation). The friend, Jennine, immediately went off and returned with a book of Seamus Heaney's poems. She pointed to this poem - \"read this!\" The poetry is incredibly powerful and strikes to the very heart but does not 'sing' in a conventional musical sense. I had to copy/paste/delete phrases and words to make a text to set. I deeply hope that what I have done remains faithful to Seamus's wonderful work. The track is performed by UltraSepulChral.

Their concept was of communities where people interacted and developed characterful environments way up above street level. It was a noble concept but the architects lived in an exclusive London square and, unfortunately, did not find the time to really find out about the needs and wishes of the people who would occupy the \"city in the sky\", as they called it. We all now know the woeful results of all of this and add to it the Thatcherite destruction of communities in the 1980s and we have the background of what I have written about. Real pride and real spirit still exist but they received a brutal and sustained assault, beginning with the Second World War blitz and continuing for decades afterwards. The attached audio features Lizzie's stunning lead vocal - re-mixed and cleaned up to show it at its best.TrackAudioScoreCity In The Skyhttps://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/City-In-The-Sky-mix-2207.mp3The Wife Of Usher’s WellVoices, recorders, block, harpsichord and bass.This song has been arranged and recorded by a variety of artists, including Steeleye Span, Karine Polwart, Bellowhead and Andreas Scholl, using different styles and different melodies. The ballad concerns a woman from Usher's Well, who sends her three sons away to sea and shortly after learns that they have died. The woman grieves bitterly for the loss of her children, cursing the winds and sea. The song implicitly draws on an old belief that one should mourn a death for a year and a day, for any longer may cause the dead to return; it has this in common with another ballad \"The Unquiet Grave\". The mother prays for their return but when, around Martinmas, the children return to her they do so as revenants, not, as she hoped, \"in earthly flesh and blood\", and it is a bleak affair. The melodies that I have used include a lovely old English folk tune, often associated with the ballad 'Dives And Lazarus' but which has appeared in various guises, including that of a well known Christian hymn, arranged by Ralph Vaughan Williams. My presentation is altogether more basic - seeking to convey the raw emotions of the mother. The chorale-like melody of her prayer is original.TrackAudioScoreThe Wife Of Usher's Wellhttps://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11-The-Wife-Of-Ushers-Well.mp3Give Me WaterKeyboards, bass, congas, tambourine, recorder, glockenspiel, voices in three-part harmony.In 1996 Benjamin Zephaniah released a collection called 'Propa Propaganda\", a series of very intense, personal, raw and political poems. One of the poems, \"Dry\", projects very physically the experience and feelings of slaves. The poem had a quite devastating effect on me. This was REAL. I quickly saw that a white man like me cannot confront an issue like the African slave trade simply by wearing my Bob Marley t-shirt and listening to reggae, great as much of it is. I have to begin the process of acknowledgment by listening to what black people are saying - especially young black people upon whom the slave trade still impacts every day of their life. I need to discover just how this country became so wealthy and who paid the price. Should I respond at all or just keep quiet and listen? I don't know. But my innermost feelings come out in music and this song happened. I have tried to simply let Benjamin Zephaniah speak and leave it at that. There is a conscious effort to avoid writing 'white man's reggae', although the influences of the great Jamaican musicians are clearly there. The music is sparse and tries to just let this heartbreaking poetry live. Jah love protect us.TrackAudioScoreWaiting For CeciliaHigh voices in three parts, piano, Irish whistle in CThis song, composed during the spring of 2018, takes as its starting point two ideas: the notion of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of musicians, who guides and inspires all who create or perform music, and Gaston Leroux's novel, \"The Phantom Of The Opera\", where the Phantom beguiles his protege by singing to her as she sleeps. A very simple accompaniment of piano and Irish whistle allows the singers to project their delicate words with the utmost clarity.TrackAudioScoreWaiting For CeciliaSeven Pink RosesVoices in two parts with piano.As a child I was often taken to visit the Derwent Reservoir just south of Sheffield. When the water was low (quite often in those days) it was possible to see the ruins of the old village of Derwent. This had a huge effect on me as I thought of the people who lived there and of their feelings when they were told that their home was to be submerged beneath a huge reservoir. There are so many resonances there - stories of how the dam was used as a practice site for the second world war Lancaster bomber pilots who were about to embark on the near-suicidal \"Operation Chastise\" - the Dambusters raid - and how, when the church tower was still visible people used to swim out to it. It was even said that the ghostly sounds of the bells could be sometimes heard floating over the dark waters. The tower was dynamited long before my time but the image stuck with me. This song explores the feelings of Derwent residents who were about to lose their cherished homes and gardens. It is performed by UltraSepulChral. The piano accompaniment is arranged for a studio ensemble of synths and percussion. I am sure that some will detect the influence of Debussy and his piano piece \"La Cathedral Engloutie\" and I hold up my hands and say yes to this.TrackAudioScoreTrack 1A Stolen GenerationHigh voices splitting to 3, piano, congasThis was a hard piece to write and, probably, a hard piece to listen to. It tells, as far a white man like me is able, of the terrible suffering of the indigenous Australian people at the hands of the white authorities. As a young person I was a big fan of the great Australian tennis champion, Evonne Goolagong. She was mixed-race and was fortunate to be discovered by an established tennis coach who enabled her immense talent to flourish. I began to realise that the story of Australia was more than that of the cricket team we lost to every so often. Then, years later, the astounding film, \"The Rabbit Fence\", shook me to the core and made me find out a lot of things that had happened. This is not a nice story and it does not have a nice ending. I suppose the music is my own way of trying to say sorry. The words are mine but draw on phrases that have been written or spoken by those who were there. It begins with a knowing mother looking lovingly at her baby, aware of what will happen. The following section graphically lays out the brutal treatment that was dished out to those children. Then there is a blues-style cynical attack on the religious hypocrisy that supposedly lay behind the cruelty. I am still uncomfortable every time I look over this section. There is now the beginning of recognition of what happened, even if attitudes have not really changed, and the final section refers to this. I hope to hear this edgy and intense music performed one day. Is there anyone out there??TrackAudioScorePassacagliaKeyboards and samplesThis is a piece of music that explores time - or actually tries to relax away from time. It focuses on the experience of itself in its moment and grew from personal reflections after reading something of Buddhist meditation and was something that, for me, was best expressed in music. Moving around very basic, slow moving chord progressions it uses the baroque form of ground bass with slowly evolving textures. The piece is a studio composition, originally growing from experimentation and improvisation rather than being written out on paper. As such it cannot be considered to be \"finished\" and may well evolve over time. I am working on an organ transcription of it.TrackAudioScorePassacagliahttps://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Passacaglia.mp3Tha Gaol Agam OrtHigh voices a2, harp (or piano), flute.The day after the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September, 2014, the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, published this poem. It is full of understanding and compassion. It also carries a little sadness. I empathise with this. The heart felt relieved that the Scottish people were to stay together with the rest of the UK but, somehow the notion of them owning their great country seemed a noble one, even if there was always a slight suspicion of opportunism emanating from the Nationalist leadership. The arrogant and inept campaign to stay, led by the British government, came close to handing victory to their opponents - a foretaste of cataclysmic events to come. The Union was forged by the sword and, if it was to break up, then far better by the ballot box than the gun. But this poem speaks of love and it connects hauntingly with me - although it lacks musical rhythm I had to set it as a song. The texture is sparse, the harmony quite edgy and the contrite tone very heartfelt. The accompaniment was originally written for string quartet but is here arranged for flute and harp. Through all of this I learned again that nothing is easy - there is sometimes no right and wrong.TrackAudioScoreIn His TempleHigh voices in two/three parts, and SATB group, piano, recorders, Tibetan singing bowlThis is a song-cycle comprising settings of seven poems from a collection entitled \"The Temple\" by George Herbert (1593 – 1633) who was a Welsh-born poet, orator and priest of the Church of England. Herbert is described as a \"metaphysical\" poet and he is recognised as one of the foremost British devotional lyricists. But these academic descriptions do scant justice to the depth of human emotion and inclusiveness found in his work. He was a Christian and an Anglican priest, who very much wrote from that perspective, but his work transcends this background and is human and universal. It is this understanding of people and the ability to connect that attracted me to his poems. Of course I had sung many of the words as anthems or hymns during my time as a chorister and they connected me back to my own childhood but mainly they speak of the world as it still is now, addressing human issues that will always be present - truth, justice, belonging. The chief musical influences are plainsong, folksong and blues but, in spirit, the music seeks to match the embracing simplicity found in the words. The textures vary between high voices, mixed ensemble, men's voices and, finally, all of the groups combined. I remain in awe of the settings that Ralph Vaughan Williams made of some of these texts and have at no point sought to emulate his towering achievements. Instead I have aimed at clarity, directness and a folk or blues-like sparseness of scoring, with mainly modal harmony.TrackAudioScore1 I Got Me Flowers2 A Virtuous Soul3 Such A Life4 The Shepherd's Call5 A Guest6 Fanfare7 The ElixirJewels For EdenVoices a3, harp and recorder.The inspiration for this was originally a shopping list. Well, a remark written at the bottom of one. My daughter, Lizzie, had written a list of mundane requirements and, beneath, her friend Eden had written \"and jewels for Eden\". The phrase caught my imagination. Soon afterwards I read \"The Return of the Native\" by Thomas Hardy. He comes back time and again to a subject that fascinates him - how we pass through a world that is always changing as its inhabitants have different needs and priorities, but which, for all of this, retains a permanence which spans all of this and seems eternal. I quoted word for word from Hardy's novel but then developed a refrain which hooks onto this concept but in an internalised way. The words are essentially about nothing - seeking to create an ambience or atmosphere which blends with the loose tonality so that the performer and listener are challenged to evolve their own interpretation and meaning. The accompaniment for harp and flute wanders almost randomly across the tonalities, giving the piece a dreamlike freedom. The performance is a very rough and ready, somewhat unbalanced live recording. An improvement is in the pipeline!TrackAudioScoreTrack 1https://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jewels-For-Eden.mp3The Water Of TyneVoice, harpsichord and folk ensemble, ad libAn old Geordie folksong about a girl separated from her lover by the murky waters of the Tyne. There are many much more traditional renderings of this tune but this driving, Irish influenced take on it immediately appealed to me. Lizzie's vocals again bring a touch of magic to this recording.TrackAudioScoreTrack 1https://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Water-Of-Tyne.mp3This is a song about a dysfunctional relationship - based on the real life accounts that Rachel and I heard from a young friend over shared lunches. The song took on its own life - becoming something like an ensemble piece from a stage musical - and the young woman involved is now happily married. To someone else!! The performance is by BellaDonna.TrackAudioScoreTrack 1https://geoffhowells.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Too-Busy-To-Say.mp3Star Of The SeaThis is an arrangement - a medieval poem to the Blessed Virgin Mary set to a roughly contemporary tune and given a modern facade.
