        "text": "Geoff Bullock is a retired Australian singer and songwriter. He was a Hillsong worship pastor at their Sydney location from 1987 to 1995. he left due to burnout. He co-authored several Hillsong songs during his tenure, including The Power of Your Love, Have Faith in God, and I Will Never Be the Same Again.\n\nHe released five albums under his name, including:\n\nYou Rescued Me: The First Ten Years Anthology 1987-1997 (1997)\n\nA Symphony of Hope (1999)\n\nDeeper and Deeper (2001)\n\nGeoff Bullock (2007)\n\nThe Power of Your Love – The Songs of Geoff Bullock (2011)\n\nHe also authored two books:\n\nHands of Grace: Jesus, God’s Symphony of Hope (1998)\n\nPower of your love: Jesus: the unexpected God (2000)\n\nLyrics can be found at https://genius.com/Geoff-bullock-the-great-southland-lyrics.\n\nNote to new users: This is a different kind of review site! Read About the Berean Test and Evaluation Criteria prior to reading this review. I strongly encourage you to consider the potential blessings and dangers of this artist‘s theology by visiting Resources.\n\n1. What message does the song communicate?\n\nThis song is about Christians following Jesus’ command to reap and harvest, that is, to fulfill the Great Commission. Through this, the Holy Spirit will bring revival to our land.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n2. How much of the lyrics line up with Scripture?\n\nThis song is Scriptural.\n\nThis song does not contain a Verse/Chorus/Bridge structure. Therefore, I assigned stanzas to each paragraph.\n\n[Stanza 1]\n\nLines 1-4. Reaping and harvesting have different contexts in the Bible. However, these opening lines speak of a future and hope, which points us directly to Matthew 9:35-38. It is here that Jesus speaks of the harvest in the context of proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to distressed and downcast people. The specific land in question is Australia; However, this concept could apply to any land that contains lost people. We do this by spreading the good news about Jesus to those who don’t know (Matthew 28:18-20).\n\n[Stanza 2]\n\nLines 1-4: In short, Holy Spirit-led revival (Isaiah 57:15). He will convict the world (John 16:7-11).\n\n[Stanza 3]\n\nLines 1-4: This explicitly confirms my interpretation of Stanza 2 as revival.\n\n[Stanza 4]\n\nLines 1-4: Rewording of previously mentioned concepts of reaping/harvesting, more details about this land, and the Spirit coming.\n\n[Stanza 5]\n\nRepeats Stanza 4.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n3. How would an outsider interpret the song?\n\nThey will probably conclude that this is a land where the Holy Spirit will bring about revival, and that Christians will prosper within it. They probably won’t think that the reaping/harvesting is souls for Christ.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n4. What does this song glorify?\n\nIt glorifies the Holy Spirit as the One ultimately responsible for revival. We cooperate with the Spirit by telling others about Jesus.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\nClosing Comments\n\nGeoff Bullock’s The Great Southland is warm. It draws Christians to treat our homeland as the mission field, harvesting souls for Jesus by spreading the Gospel. Through this, the Holy Spirit can do His work, reviving the sick and dying world. This brings Him glory. Aside from winning people for Jesus, unbelievers should easily interpret similarly.\n\nThis song is inspirational, but not suitable for corporate worship.\n\nFinal Score: 9.5/10\n\nArtist Info\n\nTrack: The Great Southland (listen to the song)\n\nArtist: Geoff Bullock\n\nAlbum: N/A\n\nGenre: Contemporary Christian Music (CCM)\n\nRelease Year: 1992\n\nDuration: 3:55\n\nAgree? Disagree? Don’t be shy or have a cow! Calmly and politely state your case in a comment, below."
