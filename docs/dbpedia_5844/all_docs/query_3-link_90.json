        "text": "Local Chattanooga-based, The Cle Elum performanced at the Nightfall’s Concert Series. The band, consisting of husband-and-wife duo Ian Lee and Sarah Sargent, with special guest Callie Sioux on bass, kicked off the night with tracks from their debut album, It’s OK If It Falls Apart. Their set featured a mix of upbeat and contemplative tunes, highlighted by their singles “Old Folks” and “Goodbye Night Sky,” which captivated the audience from start to finish.\n\nThe Cle Elum’s sound, which blends elements of indie rock with a pop touch, was the perfect opener for the headliner, Okey Dokey. The crowd responded enthusiastically, showing strong local support for the band, which has quickly become a staple of Chattanooga’s music scene.\n\nOverall, the evening at Nightfall was a celebration of local talent and indie rock, with The Cle Elum leaving a lasting impression on both new listeners and long-time fans.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript."
