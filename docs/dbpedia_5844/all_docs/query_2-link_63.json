He was educated at Roomfield School in Todmorden along with his older sister who also received music tuition. He learnt the violin second hand from her and had free trombone lessons from his friend’s father, local doctor and Orchestra President, John de Ville Mather. His talent was obvious and he gave up his apprenticeship at 17 to play the trombone professionally, while still performing locally with the Todmorden Brass Band and the Todmorden Orchestra. After World War 2 he formed his own orchestra and went on to become a world renowned musical director. From Todmorden Town Hall to Northgate Leisure Centre and onto the Royal Albert Hall and Las Vegas, Geoff worked frequently with the likes of Dame Shirley Bassey, Dame Vera Lynn, Des O’Connor and Max Bygraves.\n\nDespite his international fame his considered himself a Yorkshireman who owed it all to his upbringing in Todmorden; he used to return frequently to conduct Todmorden Brass Band in sold-out concerts. He was one of Todmorden’s first Honorary Citizens, donating one of his gold discs to the town. As a role model for young people across all cultures, he donated his trombone to Todmorden Orchestra so that other disadvantaged children could learn a musical instrument.\n\n“Geoff Love, A Love Affair with Music” will shortly be available to pre-order."
