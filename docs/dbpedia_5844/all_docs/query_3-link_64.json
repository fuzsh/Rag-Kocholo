In 2020, she launched her TikTok channel with her first two #BeatleTok videos. Creating engaging daily content, she shared “On This Day” facts and showed off her personal collection. In order to catch the attention of SiriusXM, she posted her own demo videos from her home studio. Caitlin would play a Beatles song and add her own vibrant commentary. Her videos went viral and SiriusXM and The Beatles’ Apple Corps Ltd. took notice. On the ninth day of Caitlin’s #BeatleTok videos, SiriusXM direct messaged Caitlin on Twitter, inviting her to be a guest on The Beatles Channel. Now she has her own show!
