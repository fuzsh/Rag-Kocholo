        "text": "1978 was an exceptional year for music and no more is that true than when looking at The Cars’ self-titled debut. Recorded in February of the same year, The Cars would ultimately be released on June 6th and was an immediate success amongst critics and music lovers. While it lacked a Top 10 position on the charts, The Cars has continued to sell throughout the preceding decades; so well that it has exceeded 6 million shipped units. Granted, it has been reissued ad nauseam and that has contributed to its sales success, but when an album is this good, akin to a compilation release celebrating an artist’s legacy, on their first outing, it is a record that you really need to sit up and take notice of, for The Cars is the epitome of new wave, pop rock, and power pop genres.\n\nOne recurring element keeps showing up when looking at successful debut bands. The majority of the time these bands have sharpened their skills as live performers well before entering the studio. The Cars are no exception, in this regard, and it shows when listening to this debut for they are a cohesive unit. I mention this more for posterity than any other reason as live performances prior to a recording contract, or the recording of an album, seems to be increasingly rare in the modern era and I can’t help but wonder if this is one reason why the music from the 60s to the 90s, from a band perspective, have remained so synonymous with classic album status.\n\nSeriously, and maybe I’m living under a rock, but can you name a single debut release, from a band (particularly in the rock genre) that was released post-Millennium that is a landmark release? There has to be one, surely, just none come to mind as I write this. Regardless, when you look at the pre-Cars era, for all band members, combined with the live refinement of their sound, there is little doubt as to why The Cars has remained such a notable release.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of The Cars is that the sound, while firmly planted in the 70s, is unique for the musicality is a culmination that extended beyond mere instruments and musicians. Yes, the synthetic aspects are as important to the compositions as the core unadulterated instrumentation is. Yet, despite the implementation of new techniques and associated technology, it wasn’t taken too far as to detract from the songs themselves. Roy Thomas Baker, in the production chair, certainly ensured this aspect remained in check but engineers, Geoff Workman and Nigel Walker, should similarly be acknowledged for contributing to a marvellous sonic experience that has neither dated nor feels contrived.\n\nSonically, the (Hi-Res) Lossless Apple Music Stream, an Apple Digital Master, sounds respectable even if it’s a little concealed. It’s as if there’s a thin sheet that’s been placed over your speakers. Yes, early recordings can have this quality about them, and I admit to having no additional edition to compare to, but it just doesn’t sound as dynamic and bombastic as I believe it should. Don’t get me wrong, there are no major flaws to note, and it is enjoyable, but the way it sounds on Apple Music makes me want to seek out various well-regarded physical counterparts to compare to the stream.\n\nOne example that stands out the most is on I’m In Touch With Your World. It’s a sonic masterpiece but the separation between sonic elements, combined with a shallow soundstage, means that the atmospheric styling isn't as spectacular as I believe it should be. Naturally, one of the challenging aspects is that streaming services, such as Apple Music, rarely state the particular master that was used. This is particularly poor considering Apple touts its own Apple Digital Master program but, of course, this wouldn’t be an issue had the album never been remastered time and time again.\n\nVisually, while Nataliya Medvedeva is sadly no longer with us, her grace on the cover will forever ensconce her in the social consciousness and while it shouldn’t detract from her other creative endeavours, there is little doubt that this is her most notable. Plus, it’s just a great cover, released at a time when cover art, on the large vinyl canvas, reigned supreme. How I miss those days when the artwork was done so well that it would sell you on the music well before you had a chance to hear it. Yes, cover art still exists today, but as with the polish of their sound on this debut, compared to modern counterparts, I similarly can’t recall many album covers in the last few years that have truly stood out from the crowd.\n\nGood Times Roll not only magnificently launched The Cars with its memorable rhythm and guitar licks, but it’s a killer tune with incredible layering techniques, particularly with regard to the vocal harmony. One must remember that this was pre-digital editing capabilities and was as much about skill as it was about pushing the limits of the available technology. Good Times Roll was also the third single that, despite charting, never rose to the top of the charts. A shame considering it’s such an addictive tune. Nevertheless, it has remained a fan favourite and a mainstay in the band’s back catalogue since its release.\n\nMy Best Friend’s Girl, the second single from The Cars, failed to set the charts on fire, outside of the UK where it peaked at #3, but whoever was Ric Ocasek’s best friend must have been worried when the lead vocalist and guitarist penned this classic. Not only is this tune synonymous with The Cars, but it contains one of the greatest lyrics ever penned in the history of recorded music:\n\n\"She's my best friend's girl, but she used to be mine.” – Ric Ocasek, The Cars\n\nMy Best Friend’s Girl is perfectly suited to The Cars and this debut, but the sonic style has a 60s feel to it and you could subsequently be forgiven for assuming it was released earlier than 1978.\n\nJust What I Needed was the first single from this self-titled debut and is the first song to feature bassist, Benjamin Orr, on vocals. While the multi-vocalist approach was extremely common within bands throughout the 60s and 70s, I couldn’t imagine Ocasek singing this tune even though he wrote it. This is an excellent example of where the chosen vocalist best suits the song and Orr’s vocal is the perfect driver along with the rhythm and those killer guitar licks.\n\nI’m In Touch With Your World is one of the most visual songs you can imagine as Greg Hawkes (keyboards and percussion) paints each and every sonic element into the mix. As mentioned earlier, however, this is one song where I feel the digital stream lets it down for it should be much more immersive than it is. Regardless, what an incredible piece of musical art!\n\nDon’t Cha Stop has a catchy rhythm and chorus and while it isn’t necessarily a standout, something is compelling about Don’t Cha Stop that makes it perfect for its placement in the album’s structure. All songs on an album don’t have to immediately standout and Don’t Cha Stop is one of those tunes that grow on you, particularly once the chorus kicks in. Plus, there’s a great guitar solo (albeit in the background) to be heard on this tune.\n\nYou’re All I’ve Got Tonight is moody; I love it! There’s most certainly a Skyhooks vibe going on here, particularly with the guitar tuning and associated licks. Intentional, or not, I simply adore this style of rock music as it is always uniquely fresh and doesn’t feel at all dated to the era.\n\nBye Bye Love is a great tune that keeps the album flowing. It’s also one of the few songs in that I prefer the verse to the chorus. This is most likely due to the repetitive and simple nature of the chorus, but that is a subjective element and to be honest, the entire song is compelling.\n\nMoving In Stereo is the greatest tune on this self-titled debut and I can’t fathom why it wasn’t released as a single. It has the late 70s vibe written all over it and I don’t know about you, dear reader, but I believe it would have been a chart-topper.\n\nAll Mixed Up segues beautifully from Moving In Stereo and, in some ways, can be seen as an extension of the previous song. All Mixed Up as a standalone track, however, is simply stunning. It’s a perfect bookend closer to a flawless album.\n\nFrom start to finish, The Cars is an exceptional debut that has absolutely no filler. With a modest runtime of 35 minutes, there aren’t any superfluous recordings added to the album to simply fill up the available space on the record. The adage of sometimes less is more certainly rings true, with this release, and while The Cars would go on to unveil other exceptional albums, such as Candy-O and Heartbeat City, this self-titled debut can be seen as their most cohesive body of work."
