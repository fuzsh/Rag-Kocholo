        "text": "I’m not one of those fans who feels like he needs to pick a side in the ongoing Queensrÿche war. I can appreciate both the albums Michael Wilton, Eddie Jackson, Scott Rockenfield and Parker Lundgren have released with Todd La Torre and the ones Geoff Tate has recorded as Operation: Mindcrime. I just wish they could have made them together... If there’s one good thing that came out of the Queensrÿche split, though, it’s that it’s shown us what each used to bring to the table. The songs on the self-titled album, “Condition Hüman” and “The Verdict” have some very good guitar riffs, rhythm sections and solos, that are indeed reminiscent of the early days of the EP, which Michael Wilton has said is the sound he and the rest of the band wanted to go back to, but I feel like those alone are not enough to make those records as great as “The Warning”, “Rage For Order” and “Operation: Mindcrime”. Besides the music, one thing that for me really set Queensrÿche apart from other bands was the atmosphere, depth and content they created on those albums and the three records Geoff Tate has released as Operation: Mindcrime show that that’s what he’s very good at. The problem with those, though, is that atmosphere, content and depth, even beautiful melodies and powerful choruses, of which there are quite a few present on “The Key”, “Resurrection” and “The New Reality”, aren’t enough either. You also need good guitar riffs, rhythms and solos to properly display them against.\n\nI’ll try to explain what I mean a little better. The first three LP records Queensrÿche released created these dark, otherworldly, dystopian, futuristic images, or worlds even, similar to what Geoff Tate has done on the three albums he released as Operation: Mindcrime, which show what he contributed to his former band and that he can still do that very well. Back in the 80s, however, he had Chris DeGarmo, Michael Wilton, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield to put music to them and when either he or Queensrÿche play songs from “The Warning”, “Rage For Order” or “Operation: Mindcrime” live, it’s pretty much impossible for the audience to stand still during them. On the other hand, though, although the songs Queensrÿche have written for their self-titled album, “Condition Hüman” or “The Verdict” may move the listeners’ bodies, they don’t put as powerful images in their heads, take them away to a different world or really get them thinking about their meaning, like “The Key”, “Resurrection” and “The New Reality” do. However, those are concept albums that form one big story and create a similar atmosphere as Queensrÿche did on “Operation: Mindcrime”, but there are a lot of songs on them that really don’t serve much purpose other than to create that atmosphere or provide background music for the story, sort of like the soundtrack to a movie and similar to some tracks on Pink Floyd’s “The Wall”. Granted, the atmosphere they create is very good and reminiscent of futuristic film noirs like “Blade Runner” and Geoff Tate’s story is quite clever, but you really have to be into prog or art rock, or progressive metal, or even science fiction or film noir, to be able to appreciate that sort of thing. Back when he was still working on equal terms with Chris DeGarmo, Michael Wilton, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield, they could make very good instrumental transition pieces for him that created atmosphere, advanced the story and bound the music together, but they also kept an audience’s attention during the whole experience, rather than leave the more general listener waiting for the next “real” song to begin.\n\nSo, same as I feel the current lineup of Queensrÿche needs someone like Geoff Tate to take their music, as good as it may be, to the next level, so does Geoff Tate need some good quality musicians, who understand what the fans want to hear, to be able to showcase his ideas, melodies and the atmosphere he creates. And it seems like the head of Frontiers Records, that Geoff Tate is signed to, has found just the man for that in guitar virtuoso Simone Mularoni of Italian progressive metal band DGM, who he tasked with creating an album that would sound like a Queensrÿche record from their glory days and getting their original vocalist to sing on it. And I dare say the man has succeeded: the music he came up with is so reminiscent of classic Queensrÿche and Geoff Tate sings so similar on it to how he used to during his glory days, it’s almost as if the band has finally released some old material that was originally recorded between “Operation: Mindcrime” and “Empire”, but thought lost or was previously unreleased due to contractual disputes. Because of this, if hearing the man sing live with Avantasia or perform during his Operation: Mindcrime 30th Anniversary tour wasn’t proof enough, anyone who ever claimed Geoff Tate’s voice isn’t as good as it used to be is very much proven wrong on this album. It’s full of old school Queensrÿche choruses and verses, sung in the same style he used over 30 years ago with lyrics filled with social commentary. Unfortunately, though, the record hasn’t been promoted all that much and Geoff Tate hasn’t included any of its tracks in his live set, which really is a shame, because the album contains many songs that fans of classic Queensrÿche, especially of the “Operation: Mindcrime” and “Empire” eras, will love. Like the ones on those two records, they are also accessible to people who may not be metal fans per se, but do enjoy good, melodic hard rock/ heavy metal songs with powerful choruses, so I feel like it has the possibility to appeal to a broader audience, given the proper promotion and support.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about “Sweet Oblivion Featuring Geoff Tate” is that, although I’m generally a big fan of keyboards in progressive rock and metal, on this album they’re used more in place of guitars, rather than to create atmosphere or a certain sound and I feel like it would have been better to have only used electric guitars. Simone Mularoni mentioned in an interview I read that when he first sent the music he had written to Geoff Tate, he got it back with some synthesizer background sounds added, which he didn’t seem to care for too much and convinced the singer to leave them out, but I can’t help wondering if the record couldn’t have been better still and have had a little bit more of an “Operation: Mindcrime” feel to it if they would have kept them in. Sadly, that doesn’t seem to have been the only thing they disagreed about, so, unfortunately, it doesn’t look like a follow-up will be in the works any time soon. But Geoff Tate did get complimented on the album during pretty much every interview he’s done since its release and he is going to play “Rage For Order” in its entirety during his next tour, so it seems he finally may have (re)discovered a love for heavier electric guitar riffs and he even went so far as to say he’d be open to a reunion with his former Queensrÿche band members. So even if we don’t see another collaboration with Simone Mularoni, he may have paved the way for Geoff Tate to again make the kind of music his fans really want to hear: beautiful melodies with deep, meaningful lyrics, set against a captivating atmosphere and supported by good old hard rocking guitar riffs and fast drum beats.\n\nThe phenomenon of a comeback has become a cliche concept in traditional metal circles, especially insofar as the scene on the continental United States is concerned given the scarcity of attention it has gotten in the recent past relative to much of the rest of the world. One would be remiss to gloss over the popular sentiment that the likes of Metallica and Judas Priest have seen a resurgence of quality studio output in recent years that dwarfs their contributions spanning from mid-1990s up until fairly recently, though even these seem a less auspicious affair compared to the notion of a solid heavy metal album featuring Geoff Tate's name in the band's moniker. Opinions vary as to when Queensryche began losing their way as a force in the metal world, with some pointing to their foray into post-grunge territory in 1997's Hear In The Now Frontier, others pointing to the more sleek and commercialized sound that ushered in the 90s via Empire, and a small contingent of purists might even point to the abandonment of traditional metallic fury for more prog-oriented territory that took place between The Warning and Rage For Order; but most agree that the band has rebounded following Tate's ejection.\n\nFollowing a slew of monumentally lackluster to downright bizarre studio outings first under his own version of Queensryche and then under the Operation: Mindcrime name, barring a small but vocal contingent of sycophantic tag-along types who think Tate could do no wrong, the metal world saw Tate as somebody outside of metal's purview, which was obviously not helped by Tate's own defiant attitude towards his former band mates and the larger crowd that stuck with them as they rediscovered their past power/prog magic. But in similar fashion to a number of projects enjoying their support of late, Frontiers Records and guitar impresario/DGM mastermind Simone Mularoni (who brought the titan duo of Lione/Conte into the studio together with masterful results) decided to make an effort to revitalize Tate's soiled legacy with a project that has come to be known as Sweet Oblivion. It's recently unleashed eponymous debut bears a far greater resemblance to the glorious pioneering power/prog sound that marked the zenith of Queensryche's career between 1986 and 1990, reinterpreted into a more melodic, streamlined formula in keeping with a large number of Frontiers-backed projects, but also far more impressive in terms of heaviness and technical prowess.\n\nDespite a number of rumors and a possibly fraudulent interview sourced from the Dutch-based Aardschok Magazine that features Mularoni complaining about Tate's attitude and work ethic towards the project, the end results suggest a collaboration via the internet that has struck pure metallic pay dirt. Spearheaded by a crisp, bulky production that puts needed emphasis on aggression and punch, along with a stylistic amalgam of classic late 80s Queensryche and a similar AOR-tinged melodic metal template associated with Frontiers Records fielded acts like The Ferrymen and Magnus Karlsson's Free Fall, Sweet Oblivion is the long awaited return to form that many old school Queensryche fans have been longing for out of Tate since at least the mid-90s, if not the late 80s. However, in addition to being a solid, if somewhat streamlined and radio-friendly collection of songs, it is also an album that doesn't right ignore the oddball progressive and modern rock elements that became staples of Queensryche's latter days, but rather incorporates some elements of that extremely lackluster era into something more palpable to a traditional heavy metal experience, i.e. something that doesn't meander or come off as soft and indistinct.\n\nIn addition to the meat and potatoes of this metallic mishmash of modernity and classicism, this is also an album that does a good job of showcasing the technical prowess of all the players involved. In addition to Tate's vocals having a revitalized sense of poise and flow, the guitar and keyboard work of Mularoni and his virtuoso DGM band mate Emanuele Casali show off their chops in a series of engaging yet tasteful solo interchanges throughout the album that are highly indicative of a power metal influence via Stratovarius, occasionally touched up by references to a more eclectic array of non-metal influences that gives things a latent Dream Theater sound, most particularly during the lead segments on \"A Recess From My Fate\" and the infectiously catchy opener \"True Colors\". And despite there not being any traces of raging speed metal to be found on here, drummer Paolo Caridi (who had a brief run with Arthemis before signing on with renowned Italian prog metal act Hollow Haze) makes a pretty impressive racket on more upbeat rockers like \"The Deceiver\" (which occasionally sounds like a slower cousin to \"The Needle Lies\") and the bombastic, fist-pumping groove anthem \"Behind Your Eyes\", assisted by a raunchy, bottom-heavy bass performance out of Mularoni, who opts to pull double duty in the instrumental department while also producing.\n\nThough albums that straddle the fence between old and new to any extent will have trouble satisfying everyone expecting one or the other, this is one of those albums that makes an excellent show of giving the old guard what they want while not trying to overtly relive the past. Despite the extremely souped up production bearing little resemblance to the sonic cliches of the late 80s, few Queensryche fans will be able to deny the faithful emulation of classic Mindcrime era splendor on display in such standout tracks as \"Sweet Oblivion\", \"My Last Story\" and \"The Deceiver\", nor will the overt allusions to early 90s progressive nuance such as \"Disconnect\" and \"Seek The Light\" escape the notice of those who want to hear more of the hi-fi rocking of Empire and Promised Land. All the same, this is an album that is very much rooted in the present, while obviously being highly aware of the past from which it flows, resulting in a fairly compact listening experience that is both heavy and catchy enough to rope in any trustee of AOR-infused power metal acts such as Masterplan, Serious Black and The Unity, alongside the large collection of naysayers who have written off Geoff Tate as a metal musician with a future. Naturally he didn't quite outdo his former band mates this time around, but if one were to call this a competition, this album is where he started pushing back.\n\nIt seems like Geoff Tate has gotten rather humbled in the last couple of years. After releasing a conceptual trilogy under the questionable Operation: Mindcrime banner, the former Queensryche singer finally seems content to let somebody else take the reins. Avantasia has used Tate to fairly constructive ends on their most recent efforts and while his name is prominently featured here on Sweet Oblivion’s self-titled debut, it was actually masterminded by DGM guitarist Simone Mularoni. This may also be the band-oriented effort he’s sung on in decades.\n\nPredictably enough, Sweet Oblivion’s style draws from the line between prog rock and classic metal that defined Queensryche circa Empire. The songs generally opt for straightforward linear structures driven by crunchy, shiny guitars and big heaps of vocal layering. There’s also a somber aura that reminds me of Evergrey or Heir Apparent’s recent outings and one can hear occasional tinges of power metal that recalls classic Pyramaze.\n\nThe musicianship is more balanced than I had anticipated. There aren’t many riffs per se, but the guitars and bass manage to put in some intricate progressions as well as decent foundations for the vocals. The keyboards play a solid supporting role, generally opting for backing textures but occasionally chiming in with some flashier playing. Even the vocals sound better than I expected; it’s pretty clear that Tate is playing it safe in terms of flexing his range, but his technique serves the material well enough.\n\nBut with all this in mind, the songwriting is a little too lethargic for its own good. Individual tracks can be tricky to distinguish due to a heavy emphasis on mid-tempo pacing and while nothing is offensively bad, the drawn-out vocal lines and rather nondescript riffing can make for tedious listening. Fortunately, “Behind Your Eyes” shows early signs of life and the second half does mix things up. I can appreciate the more atmospheric approach on “Disconnect” and the speed on “The Deceiver” is welcome, albeit potentially coming in too late for a full impact.\n\nI’m still not sure why Sweet Oblivion went with the name of a Screaming Trees album, but their self-titled debut is a decent workmanlike offering. Some snappy hooks or extra energy boosts would’ve gone a long way in emboldening the songwriting, but the solid musicianship reinforces the potential that this project has to offer. I wouldn’t rank this above anything that Queensryche has released with Todd LaTorre, but I can see nostalgic Geoff Tate fans getting a lot out of it. Either way, Sweet Oblivion is easily the best thing he’s been a part of since the Clinton administration.\n\nHighlights:\n\n“Behind Your Eyes”\n\n“Disconnect”\n\n“The Deceiver”\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n\nSimone Mularoni has returned with yet another new project in Sweet Oblivion featuring Geoff Tate (ex-Queensryche, Operation Mindcrime). This guy seems to be everywhere these days; he’s played in recent releases of Ancient Bards, Lione/Conti, and his own prog band, DGM, he’s lent session support to countless other projects including Elvenking and Hell in the Club, and he’s also been busy taking care of the mixing and mastering for some new releases, such as the upcoming Moonlight Haze album. Of course, his involvement in numerous projects doesn’t mean anything on its own, but when his involvement is in so many excellent bands, that definitely means something.\n\nSo, it’s needless to say that I was fairly excited to hear what his latest brainchild, Sweet Oblivion, would have to offer. After all, as a fan of most everything Mularoni’s done, I know that he is a very capable and accomplished musician. And, along with fellow-DGM member Emanuele Casali on keys and session drummer Paolo Caridi, I thought that the talent pool would be deep enough to pull something great out of.\n\nBut, as if carrying on some sort of curse that started in the mid-00s, letting Geoff Tate anywhere near this project has made it suffer nearly to the point of no redemption. Rather than paying homage to the golden years of Queensryche, as Mularoni hoped to accomplish with Sweet Oblivion, the product has instead tread more closely to the doomed footprints of Operation: Mindcrime. Almost the entire record comes off as uninspired, monotonous, and ultimately a chore to listen to all at once. It has a couple minor moments of hope, but most are found so late in the album that it’s already a lost cause by the time they arrive.\n\nIf there’s one thing that’s good in the album, it’s the guitarwork. Though few and far between, there are some great riffs to be found, especially in ‘Behind Your Eyes’, ‘The Deceiver’, and the intro of ‘True Colors’. Additionally, both the background parts and solos in most of the songs are well done, so that’s a bonus. The rest of the performances are less-than-memorable. The drums and melodies are simplistic and, like many of the tracks themselves (‘Hide Away’, ‘My Last Story’, ‘Sweet Oblivion’), ultimately forgettable. I’m not a huge fan of Tate’s voice, but that’s more a personal issue of preference than an issue with his performance, which is about what you’d expect.\n\nThis album is decent, but that’s as far as it gets. The best part of the album isn’t found until ‘The Deceiver’, which is the second-to-last track, in which there’s actually a sense of excitement, which leaves me wondering: where in the fuck was this energy in the rest of the album? While the tempo is partially responsible for this boost, I’m more talking about the fact that this song seems to have had more work put into it than all of the others combined, except maybe ‘True Colors’. It’s dynamic, interesting, and has something new to offer.\n\nWhen all things are considered, Sweet Oblivion’s debut is pretty disappointing. Despite all of the tools being present for a great album, it doesn’t quite make the cut that it strove for. With a little less desire to keep it Queensryche-y and a little more drive to make something special, the band could surely come up with something noteworthy. But, until then, I’m gonna leave this album in my past, where it belongs.\n\nOriginally written for PowerThorn.com"
