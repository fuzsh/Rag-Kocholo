        "text": "Album Review of Carole Sylvan: Love\n\nCarole Sylvan‘s hall of fame voice is the driving force behind this soulful, blues-influenced R&B album, Love. An established New England/New York treasure with an admirable career-to-date, a solo album like this provides an opportunity to experience Carole’s performance skills in all their glory.\n\nThe album showcases Carole’s vocal range right off the bat, from explosive power to soft, rich, resonating warmth, with its first two songs. Memorable, powerful, energetic “What Do You Call It? (I Call It Love)” provides get-to-your-feet energy, while the smooth, flowing “To Love Somebody” follows with laid-back, jazzy warmth.\n\nNot to be outdone, and perhaps it’s the choir-like harmonies, but “I Still Love You Anyway,” a balladic powerhouse with soaring verses, is so powerful that it’s almost a religious experience.\n\nFourth track “Love to Love” is the bluesiest cut so far on the disc, with playful, tempo-boosting horns making frequent, well-timed incursions into the song, seeming to battle with Carole’s voice for emphatic power. Then the lyrics – and Carole’s delivery – join the playfulness on the funky-soulful “Keep It Clean.”\n\nCarole’s vocals launch into powerhouse/diva orbit on the powerful “Lighthouse,” a song during which her voice will give you goosebumps during some of its most commanding moments.\n\nThe funk returns on “I Cry For You,” which I can envision as an on-stage showpiece; also, a song on which you’ll be convinced Carole coolly sings “well, well, well” way more often than she really does – that’s once; actually twice, but consecutively and not again. (Go back and listen again; you’ll see I’m right.)\n\nNext up is the most widely-recognized song on the album, “Tennessee Whiskey.” Carole’s version is of the soaring, soulful variety and, once you’ve heard it, may well become your favorite rendition of this ubiquitous standard. The music and tempo is pretty straightforward, with few liberties taken, though the instrumental bridge is quite nice, particularly the nifty horn-work, but oh, mostly you’ll simply dig that voice! (Fun quiz: How many syllables are there in the word “warm”? Ha! Yeah, you’re not even close!)\n\n“The Only One Around” is a hip, jazzy number that’s perhaps the most of each – the hippest and the jazziest – found in this collection.\n\nCarole closes the disc with a one-minute “Love to Love (Reprise),” tying the disc together nicely with its recollection of the cool groove from “Love to Love,” providing a nice fade-out ending to Love.\n\nMore Recently\n\nLove was a 2021 release. In 2022, Carole released another full-length disc, Something Goin’ On.\n\nCarole was inducted into the New England Music Hall of Fame this year, celebrated during the NEMHOF induction ceremony on September 30th."
