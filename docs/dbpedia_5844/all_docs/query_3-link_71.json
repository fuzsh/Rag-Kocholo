        "text": "Here’s my quarterly RPM review post giving some details and thoughts about the 2017 Q1 release, RPM 73. I’ll start with my general thoughts for the release, and if you’re interested in a track-by-track breakdown, keep on reading.\n\nGeneral Thoughts\n\nRPM 73 is the eighteenth full release of this program that I’ve coached, and it really shines thanks to the music. Based on what I learned in my AIM 2 training, I’m starting to see how RPM is starting to be more about a group of riders together on a cardiovascular training journey rather than an in-your-face challenge to be overcome.\n\nAs for the music, we have a mix of regulars and new artists. The regulars are Benny Benassi, Chris Brown, Seven Lions, Andrew Rayel, and Kristina Antuna. Our newcomers are The 1975, Shapeshifter, 3 Doors Down, KLP, Remi, and Broods. There are many musical styles in this release, and I can tell the programmers really thought about how to let the music speak for us.\n\nThere are three education items for this quarter: RPM vs SPRINT, tips for memorizing choreography, and an update on Les Mills GRIT for waistline reduction. There’s also the RPM Science Update which has been part of the past several releases. Important: Fellow RPM instructors should review the RPM vs SPRINT section as it mentions the specific terminology and focus for each program. For example, in RPM we don’t say “load” any more, and we don’t think of it as training. It’s a subtle shift, but keeping that in the back of your mind helps you bring the right energy to the class.\n\nThe masterclass has four main presenters — Glen Ostergaard (Program Director), Sarah Ostergaard (Head of Training for RPM), Brent Findlay (RPM Instructor from New Zealand), and Eerika Kiuttu (RPM Trainer from Finland); there were also nine shadow presenters. As for the masterclass itself, it was fairly typical. It wasn’t filmed in the typical venue (Studio 1 in Auckland City), and it looks like there were a fair number of riders in the audience.\n\nFor instructors, here are some videos from Les Mills with coaching tips:\n\nRPM 73, by Erica Marsh\n\nRPM 73 comments from Sarah Ostergaard\n\nSee you next time for RPM 74!\n\nTrack-by-track Breakdown\n\nPack Ride\n\nThe Sound – The 1975\n\nCadence: 120 rpm\n\nGenre: indie pop\n\nKey: C major\n\nOrigin: The 1975 (George Daniel, Adam Hann, Matthew Healy, Ross MacDonald) is from Manchester, England\n\nReleased: February 2016\n\nOther releases: The 1975 is new to RPM and BODYJAM\n\nThoughts\n\nThe track is upbeat and has an easy-to-follow rhythm to get the class started.\n\nAs for choreography, this Pack Ride is pretty typical. The focus is on connecting with your class.\n\nPoint of difference: Very minor, but we add the appropriate gear before the 1/1 phases instead of at the beginning of the phase.\n\nGood lyric cues\n\n“I know when you’re around…because I know the sound of your heart”\n\nPace\n\nParadise – Benny Benassi & Chris Brown\n\nCadence: 133 rpm\n\nGenre: electro house\n\nKey: B major\n\nOrigins:\n\nBenny Benassi is from Reggio Emilia, Italy\n\nChris Brown is from the US\n\nReleased: March 2016\n\nOther releases\n\nBODYJAM\n\nBODYJAM 47 – Waters of March (Benny Benassi Remix)\n\nBODYJAM 49 – Womanizer (Benny Benassi Mix)\n\nBODYJAM 53 (Isolations) – I Can Transform Ya\n\nBODYJAM 55 (Isolations) – Shawty Get Loose\n\nBODYJAM 58 (Future Funk) – Beautiful People, (Groovedown) – She Ain’t You\n\nBODYJAM 60 (We Found One Close To Me) – Close to Me (R3hab Remix)\n\nBODYJAM 62 (Turn Up the Quasar) – Turn Up the Music\n\nBODYJAM 63 (Thunder Kick Ninja Styles) – Trumpet Lights\n\nBODYJAM 67 (Warmup) – I Can Only Imagine, (Groovedown) – Fine China, (Dark House 2013) Let’s Go\n\nBODYJAM 74 (Get It Lit) – Five More Hours\n\nBODYJAM 75 (Groovedown) – Do It Again\n\nBODYJAM 77 (Isolations) – Picture Me Rollin’\n\nBODYJAM 79 (Old School Hip Hop) – Run It!\n\nRPM\n\nRPM 52 (Pack Ride) – Beautiful People\n\nRPM 53 (Stretch) – She Ain’t You\n\nRPM 57 (Pack Ride) – Don’t Wake Me Up\n\nThoughts\n\nMusically this track really shines. There’s a wonderful contrast to the soft parts as we set up the Standing Climbs and build up to the drops where the sprints start. Set up the sprint, then say nothing for a good 15 seconds while the music grabs the pedals.\n\nThe Pace track for RPM 72 (Place on Earth) is very similar in format: climbs, sprints, and then very quick transitions back to the climbs.\n\nThe three blocks are fairly identical in structure, so this is where objective scripting can help me create different goals for each block.\n\nPoint of difference: None\n\nGood lyric cues\n\n“You better be ready”\n\n“I’ll see you on the other side”\n\nHills\n\nIn Colour – Shapeshifter\n\nCadence: 126 rpm\n\nGenre: indie synth\n\nKey: C# major\n\nOrigin: Shapeshifter (Nick Robinson, Dan Mcgruer, Sam Trevethick, and P digs) is from Christchurch, New Zealand\n\nReleased: May 2013\n\nOther releases: Shapeshifter is new to RPM and BODYJAM\n\nThoughts\n\nMusic note: Apparently Shapeshifter is more well known for drum and bass style, but this track doesn’t quite fit that mold. I took a guess and called it “indie synth.”\n\nAgain, there’s a good contrast between the verses (simple vocals, beat, and bass line) and the chorus (full synths, soaring vocals).\n\nI like how you can simultaneously feel the main pulses at 63 bpm and the sub-pulses at 126 bpm. It helps the speed changes make more sense — you feel the heavy climbing beat, and use the under-current for the 3/4 phases.\n\nBased on comments I’ve seen in the RPM Instructors Facebook group, there seem to be more people that didn’t care for this track.\n\nWe’ve had fast sections in a Hills track before (think Not Many from RPM 71), and uphill accelerations (think Place on Earth from RPM 72); this track feels more like a Mixed Terrain to me.\n\nPoint of difference: Standing Attack phases at Medium pace\n\nGood lyric cues\n\n“Would you be so bold, and make it new?”\n\n“You went and chased the miles away”\n\n“I’m burning energy, my beating heart”\n\nMixed Terrain\n\nThe Broken – 3 Doors Down\n\nCadence: 140 rpm\n\nGenre: alternative rock / post-grunge\n\nKey: a minor\n\nOrigin: 3 Doors Down (Brad Arnold, Chris Henderson, Greg Upchurch, Chet Roberts, and Justin Biltonen) is from Mississippi\n\nReleased: March 2016\n\nOther releases: 3 Doors Down is new to RPM and BODYJAM\n\nThoughts\n\nThe angsty feel of the music fits well with the choppy changes in choreography (i.e., 6 short blocks, quick/sharp transitions).\n\nAs I mentioned before, the Hills track feels like a Mixed Terrain; this Mixed Terrain feels like an Intervals — short efforts, quick Attacks.\n\nPoints of difference:\n\nFour of the blocks have two Standing Attacks at Medium pace\n\nI believe this is the first Mixed Terrain track that uses Attack resistance\n\nGood lyric cues\n\n“Your heart is the only friend you have in this whole world”\n\n“Take back your world today”\n\nIntervals\n\nSummer of the Occult – Seven Lions\n\nCadence: 85 rpm\n\nGenre: progressive house\n\nKey: a minor/major\n\nOrigin: Seven Lions (Jeff Montalvo) is from Santa Barbara, California\n\nReleased: March 2016\n\nOther releases\n\nRPM 59 (Mountain Climb) – I Don’t Deserve You (Seven Lions Remix)\n\nRPM 71 (Speed Work) – Cusp\n\nRPM 72 (Speed Work) – Falling Away (MitiS Remix)\n\nThoughts\n\nThis track has claimed Favorite Intervals Track in my book by a wide margin. The music is intense and just makes you want to fight those heavy gears.\n\nSeven Lions knocks it out of the park again — highs and lows, blending a world-music style, dubstep, and drum and bass. I love the quiet right before the beat drop; I just set up the tension, and then shut up and ride for 20 seconds.\n\nSarah, who coached this track in the masterclass, gave an interesting cue for the resistance in the heavy climbs for Blocks 1 and 2: “Double it.” That’s not quite accurate but it does create that urgency and weight that you want the legs to feel.\n\nPoint of difference: The first two blocks have heavy 35-second half-pace climbs after the 45-second 1/1 intervals.\n\nGood lyric cues\n\nN/A\n\nSpeed Work\n\nOnce In A Lifetime Love – Andrew Rayel feat. Kristina Atuna\n\nCadence: 128 rpm\n\nGenre: big room house\n\nKey: B-flat major\n\nOrigins:\n\nAndrew Rayel (Andrei Rață) is from the Republic of Moldova\n\nKristina Antuna is from Los Angeles\n\nReleased: March 2016\n\nOther releases\n\nRPM 72 (Mountain Climb) – Rise of the Era (Digital X Remix)\n\nThoughts\n\nAs far as choreography goes, this is a fairly standard Speed Work track: three sprints of equal lengths with recoveries in between.\n\nFitting with the theme for this release, you can easily use the musical contrast to build up to the chorus, then let the music fill the room.\n\nJust like the Pace track, when the choreography is very similar between blocks, objective scripting makes the track come alive. My three focuses: fine tune, use the music to find a steady cadence, make this your best chase.\n\nPoint of difference: None\n\nGood lyric cues\n\n“I still believe we can make it”\n\n“Once in a lifetime love”\n\nMountain Climb\n\nParnassia – Winter Twilight\n\nCadence: 66 rpm\n\nGenre: progressive electro house\n\nKey: e minor\n\nOrigins:\n\n(I believe Winter Twilight is a cover band; the video linked above is from Blasterjaxx & DBSTF.)\n\nBlasterjaxx (Idir Makhlaf and Thom Jongkind) is from The Netherlands\n\nDBSTF (D-Block & S-te-Fan (Diederik Bakker and Stefan den Daas)) is from The Netherlands\n\nReleased: December 2015\n\nOther releases\n\nBODYJAM 74 (Mash It) – Beautiful World\n\nRPM 62 (Mountain Climb) – Adagio for Strings (Blasterjaxx Remix)\n\nThoughts\n\nThis rides like a typical Mountain Climb — some ups, some downs, heavy gears, nearly identical rounds.\n\nThe music fits well when we sit for the Power Climbs; Blocks 2 and 3 have the option to go above the rhythm.\n\nPoint of difference: None\n\nGood lyric cues\n\n“Bring the beat back”\n\nRide Home / Stretch\n\nRecover – KLP feat. Remi\n\nCadence: 85 rpm\n\nGenre: deep Australian indie\n\nKey: A major\n\nOrigins:\n\nKLP is from Sydney, Australia\n\nRemi (Remi Kolawole) is from Melbourne, Australia\n\nReleased: September 2015\n\nOther releases: KLP and Remi are new to RPM and BODYJAM\n\nThoughts\n\nI have to give it to the RPM team — it’s a clever play on the track name. The music feels fresh and has a bit more upbeat energy for a wind-down track.\n\nThe recovery modes and stretches are the usual ones you’d see in a Ride Home / Stretch track, so nothing new to report here.\n\nPoint of difference: None\n\nGood lyric cues\n\n(None really fit that well)\n\nOutro\n\nFree – Broods\n\nCadence: 92 rpm\n\nGenre: synthpop / industrial\n\nKey: b minor\n\nOrigins: Broods (Georgia and Caleb Nott) is from Nelson, New Zealand\n\nReleased: April 2016\n\nOther releases: Broods is new to RPM and BODYJAM\n\nThoughts\n\nGreat way to end the class — “Hallelujah, I’m free, I’m free, I’m free.”\n\nThis track musically makes for a decent Outro — it’s a bit too fast to be an RPM track, but it feels current/modern."
