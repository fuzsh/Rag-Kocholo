        "text": "Is it simply the product of what we listened to and what was popular when we were young, or are we born with a predisposition toward certain genres?\n\nI attended an after show of an ’80s band recently. And the guitar player, who is in his mid-thirties — so he’s obviously not an original — was playing air guitar to Rod Stewart’s “Stay with Me.” His band doesn’t play the same genre of music as Rod Stewart but it has a nice hook to it and we like what we like, right?\n\nThat got me thinking. Why do we like the genres of music we like? Is it simply the product of what we listened to and what was popular when we were young, or are we born with a predisposition toward certain genres?\n\nNature or nurture?\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was a huge Elvis fan. Maybe because my mom liked his music, or maybe the way he commanded the stage drew me in. I am not sure. But I used my allowance to buy his LPs, and I listened to them repeatedly. And I used to practice my Elvis snarl. I mean, who didn’t, right?\n\nWhen I was in junior high school, I had two cousins who were really into music. We had a battle of the bands situation going on. Whenever I visited, one cousin played the Beatles. For whatever reason, I didn’t gravitate toward their music. The other cousin played Aerosmith and soon, Aerosmith became my favorite band."
