        "text": "As hip-hop celebrates 50 years of musical and cultural history, GRAMMY.com is exploring the genre’s influence and international reach through the decades. Much of its success and longevity is a credit to established acts who have broken geographical barriers. Meanwhile, contemporary supernovas have driven rap forward in recent years.\n\nTheir transcendent powers have allowed hip-hop to be as cross-cultural as ever before, with the genre trickling into other musical landscapes such as reggaeton, Afrobeats, dancehall, Afro-swing, and countless others. While artists Lil Baby, 21 Savage, Lil Uzi Vert, and Future have held down the domestic fort, exports like Drake, Central Cee, and others are drawing eyes and massive crowds across country lines.\n\nBy establishing their influences, these artists have also added to the assemblage of subgenres within rap. One example is the evolution of trap and drill music, and the recent insertion of reggaeton and afro beats into the larger hip-hop sphere. Many of them have led to industry-rattling hits and GRAMMY wins, but one can’t ignore how hip-hop’s other forms have contributed to its increasingly widespread appeal.\n\nWhile there’s no limit on rap’s expansion, here’s a look at some of the most diverse and uniquely creative subgenres that have spawned from hip-hop’s roots.\n\nBoom Bap\n\nArtists: Dave East, Joey Bada$$, Action Bronson\n\nWith a snapping drum and snare bass, boom bap became the backdrop of hip-hop’s golden age during the 1980s and early 1990s. The sound was exemplified by now-legendary artists like LL Cool J, Nas, the Notorious B.I.G., and groups like Wu-Tang Clan, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb Deep, who were at the center of New York’s supremacy during that period.\n\nAfter peaking in the late 1990s, boom bap had a resurgence during the early 2010s with the rise of Tri-State talents Joey Bada$$, Action Bronson, Dave East, and Bishop Nehru, who offered a more nuanced take on 1990s East Coast sound.\n\nGangsta Rap\n\nArtists: Schoolboy Q, 50 Cent, Ice Cube\n\nTales of street life are rooted in hip-hop, as it’s long reflected the reality many artists endure along their journey to stardom. With the emergence of gangsta rap in the late 1980s, the subgenre became their canvas.\n\nEstablished by Philadelphia rapper Schoolly D and Ice-T, gangsta rap soon grew in popularity with legendary Southern California acts like N.W.A., Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and others taking the helm in the 1980s and 90s. In time, gangsta rap spread across rap’s various regions and later inspired drill and trap music.\n\nTrap\n\nArtists: Young Thug, Future, 21 Savage\n\nAmong all of hip-hop’s subgenres, trap remains arguably one the most popular and widespread sounds. It started as an off-shoot of gangsta rap in the early 1990s with the emergence of Southern acts like UGK, Goodie Mob, and Three 6 Mafia, but pioneers like Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, and T.I. elevated the once niche sound to the mainstream.\n\nCharacterized by rattling hi-hats, hard-hitting kicks and tales of street life, trap is the sound of Billboard-topping hits by the likes of Travis Scott, Lil Uzi Vert, 21 Savage, and others.\n\nJersey Club\n\nArtists: UNIIQU3, Bandmanrill, Cookie Kawaii\n\nOriginally called Brick City Club, this style of electronic club music was crafted in Newark, New Jersey by DJ Tamiel. Like Baltimore Club music, it fuses house and hip-hop at a frenetic pace. The subgenres are differentiated by tempo, with Jersey club beats reaching speeds of 150 BPM compared to Baltimore’s 130 BPM.\n\nThe subgenre took a turn in the mid-2000s, with artist Chad B becoming one of the first rappers to rhyme over Jersey club beats. The relatively new subgenre continues to gain momentum with artists Bandmanrill and Cookie Kawaii producing viral TikTok hits like \"Heartbroken\" and \"Vibe (If I Back It Up).\"\n\nRap Rock\n\nArtists: Lil Yachty, Kid Cudi, Lil Wayne\n\nIt’s easy to see why rappers are considered modern rock stars — with the electrifying performances and rowdy fanbases and all — and the rap rock subgenre hasn’t trailed too far behind. Artists Lil Wayne, Young Thug, Kid Cudi, and Lil Yachty have all layered their voices over thunderous, guitar-ridden beats to explore the boundless nature of rock music.\n\nBut before these artists dove into the punk world, pioneers like Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, and producer Rick Rubin were the innovators of the rap rock movement. While it hasn’t led to Billboard hits or GRAMMY wins in recent years, it remains a point of sonic exploratio for the genre’s biggest stars.\n\nPop Rap\n\nArtists: Nicki Minaj, Flo Rida, Pitbull\n\nWhile gangsta rap and trap have long dominated hip-hop, pop rap artists Nicki Minaj, Pitbull, Flo Rida, and others have contributed to the genre’s expansion on a global scale. The elements of pop rap have seen many iterations over the years, with early adopters like Ja Rule and Nelly fusing melody-driven tunes with gritty lyrics in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe subgenre is often criticized by hip-hop purists, but it’s gained considerable popularity as artists Drake, Coi Leray, Doja Cat, Wiz Khalifa, and others have endeared crowds across different genres.\n\nHyphy\n\nArtists: E-40, Too-$hort, Keek Da Sneak, Mistah F.A.B.\n\nThe word \"hyphy\" is slang for \"hyperactive,\" and rapper Keak Da Sneak is known for coining the term and helping shape the distinctly East Oakland sound. The hyphy movement is synonymous with the San Francisco Bay Area, where artists such as E-40, Mac Dre, Mistah F.A.B. and others created party music with pounding, fast-paced beats and lyrics often centered on partying and drug use.\n\nThe subgenre amassed mainstream success in the mid 2000s with E-40’s \"Tell Me When To Go,\" which drew millions of hip-hop fans to the once regional sound. After the buzz faded toward the back half of the 2000s, the hyphy movement had a resurgence in the mid-2010s, with artists like Drake, YG, Mustard and others borrowing the energy-fueled sound on street hits like \"Who Do You Love?\" and \"Why You Always Hatin?\" Contemporary rap stars and Bay Area ambassadors like Larry June, P-Lo, Kamaiyah and others continue to breathe new life into hyphy culture.\n\nPimp Rap\n\nArtists: Suga Free, Three 6 Mafia, UGK\n\nThe influences of pimp rap can be traced back to the popular blaxploitation films of the 1970s and the graphic depictions from ex-pimp and author Iceberg Slim. Naturally, the visual representation and narrative elements of the pimp lifestyle made its insertion into a wide variety of rap styles.\n\nAmong the most influential artists includes Ice-T, Slick Rick, Suga Free, who cascaded to popularity with the songs \"Why U Bull—in’?\" and \"I’d Rather Give You My Bitch\" in the late 1990s. And groups Three 6 Mafia and UGK were also massive influencers of pimp rap, with their playalistic and womanizing-inspired hits like \"It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp\" and \"Int’l Players Anthem (I Choose You)\" adding to the subgenre.\n\nG-Funk\n\nArtists: Payroll Giovanni, Larry June, Jay Worthy\n\nWhat To Know: Along with elevating talents like Eminem, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, and other mainstream acts, Dr. Dre is often cited as the father of the G-funk sound. G-Funk incorporates rap and funk music of the 1970s, especially that of the Goerge Clinton-led band Parliament-Funkadelic, which Dr. Dre established with 1992’s The Chronic.\n\nWhile far less popular compared to its earlier form, elements of the F-funk sound have been adopted by artists like Detroit rapper Payroll Giovanni, Larry June and Jay Worthy.\n\nDrill\n\nArtists: Chief Keef, G Herbo, Polo G\n\nA mix of trap music and gangsta rap, drill emerged in Chicago in the early 2010s under artists Chief Keef, Fredo Santana, Lil Reese, G Herbo, and others. The subgenre is known for its explicit, nihilistic lyrics and untamed aggression, which can be found in the early releases of Keef and company. And while Chicago drill’s momentum subsided in the mid-2010s, a renewed Lil Durk and Polo G have helped restore its luster.\n\nSince elevating to the mainstream in 2012, drill’s influence made its way across state and international borders. Artists Fivio Foreign, Sheff G, and the late Pop Smoke established Brooklyn drill in the late 2010s, while UK drill has been headed by stars Central Cee, Digga D, Dave, and others.\n\nHorrorcore\n\nArtists: Eminem, Tech N9ne, Insane Clown Posse\n\nHorrorcore delves into violent and graphic themes like death, satanism, and cannibalism. Think death metal, but with a moody hip-hop beat overlaying the dark and often grotesque lyrics. Horrorcore records are often inspired by slasher films, and some of the most notable artists that explored the subgenre are Tech N9ne, Eminem, Mars, and Detroit-bred duo Insane Clown Posse.\n\n50 Artists Who Changed Rap: Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem & More\n\nOriginating in the early 2010s on the southside of Chicago, the hip-hop subgenre drill has transcended borders to become a global phenomenon.\n\nCharacterized by a menacing and dark energy, drill music sets itself apart from traditional rap and hip-hop through its violent, aggressive lyrics and undertones. Drill music incorporates slower, heavier beats that often blend distorted 808 basslines, dark synths, and trap-style hi-hats.\n\nThe gritty, lawless sound, pioneered by artists like King Louie, Chief Keef, G Herbo and GRAMMY-award winner Lil Durk, remains at the core of the drill. Their influence is spreading to more mainstream acts like Cash Cobain — whose melodic, sultry \"Attitude\" exemplifies sample drill and landed him at No. 25 on Billboard's Hot Rap Songs — and Ice Spice, whose bold and perky lyrics contrast drill beats. As a whole, these artists are proving that drill is more than just graphic and horrid lyrical stories; it can be fun and even make you feel like a baddie.\n\nVariations on drill music can be heard in regions such as South America, Africa, and Europe. The controversial but incredibly popular UK drill, which was born in the south London neighborhood of Brixton, draws many aesthetic influences from Chicago drill while maintaining its own stylistic differences. Where Chicago drill is heavily influenced by trap music, UK drill can be seen as a type of British gangsta rap, or \"road rap.\" Young UK artists like Digga D and Central Cee have taken over the genre, both scoring entries on the Billboard chart, and with Central landing features with Drake and Lil Baby.\n\nA new generation of drill rappers are continuing to evolve the sound of the genre by combining drill beats and lyrics with a wide range of influences. Read on to learn about 10 budding drill artists whose innovative sounds and diverse perspectives are evolving the global drill landscape.\n\nExplore More: Drill Music Is On The Rise Around The World.

The Bronx-born rapper has quickly risen in prominence in New York's drill music scene following 2022 singles \"Bump It\" and \"The Realest,\" both of which showcased her raw energy and talent.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"Queen of Bronx drill\" continues to refine her rapid-fire rhymes while maintaining a fierce competitiveness, setting her apart in the male-dominated drill space. In April, Kenzo B teamed up with Harlem rapper Bianca Bonnie to drop their ultra-femme anthem \"What You Talkin Bout?\"\n\nWolfacejoeyy\n\nKnown for his sexy drill singalongs, Wolfacejoeyy is one of the most exciting rising rappers from NYC’s \"forgotten borough,\" Staten Island. The 21-year-old seamlessly weaves hooky, charismatic rhymes into signature Staten-style instrumentals. On songs like the viral \"cake\" and \"wya,\" Joeyy taps into an alter ego that teeters between hopeless romantic and relentless f—boy, backed with dynamic hats and a heavy bass.\n\nHis highly-anticipated 13-track debut album Valentino, dropped last month and includes a feature from R&B singer Reuben Aziz and production from \"Power\" actor Michael Rainey Jr., who raps as WhereIs22.\n\nS.Pri Noir\n\nBorn to a Senegalese mother and father from Guinea-Bissau, S.Pri Noir is based in France. Despite rapping in French, hip-hop artist S.Pri Noir's music is slowly transcending borders — grabbing the attention of audiences worldwide.\n\nS.Pri Noir’s 2018 debut album Masque Blanc reached No. 18 on the Top Albums chart in France. Earlier this month, he delivered a thrilling freestyle on \"On The Radar Radio,\" channeling his inner Cash Cobain. After a recent Instagram post, fans are speculating a potential collaboration between the two artists will drop soon.\n\nS.Pri Noir represents the next big market in drill: Africa. Many budding artists in the genre, especially from Europe, are second or third-generation African immigrants.\n\nIvorian Doll\n\nGerman British rapper Ivorian Doll is making a name for herself in the UK drill scene. Boldly claiming the title \"Queen of Drill,\" she's carving out a unique niche with explosive lyrics, drill-infused tension, and undeniable pop appeal. Each of her anthems is a potent cocktail of drama and attitude, highlighting her razor-sharp signature style that's firmly anchored in unfiltered, hard-hitting lyricism.\n\nThe 26-year-old rapper debuted in 2018 as part of a duo, dropping the infectious drill track \"The Situation.\" Since embarking on her solo journey, she's continued to captivate audiences with standout releases like \"Queen of Drill,\" \"Daily Duppy\" and the buzz-worthy song \"Rumour.\" Her ascent in the drill scene exemplifies a fresh voice bringing new energy to the genre, blending cultural influences with raw talent and unapologetic star quality.\n\nBobby Tootact\n\nHarlem rapper Bobby Tootact is known for remixing popular Afro-Caribbean songs — from Afrobeats bangers such as Wizkid’s \"Joro\" to dancehall like Teejay’s \"Drift\" — into drill tracks with overtly rough lyrics. On 2023's \"Real Facts\" (produced by go-to mixer Lowkeymali‬), Bobby raps about gun violence while sampling Wizkid’s popular Afrobeats dance track \"Ojuelegba.\"\n\nAs the child of Senegalese immigrants, Bobby's music reflects a fusion of his cultural heritage and his upbringing in Harlem. This combination allows him to create a distinctive musical identity that resonates with fans of multiple genres while merging two completely different musical worlds.\n\n163Margs\n\nBlending gritty lyrics with infectious beats, Nottingham's very own 163Margs has struck a chord with listeners craving traditional UK drill music from a young artist. Margs, who debuted in 2023, has already collaborated with UK heavyweights like Digga D, Bandokay, and Blanco. His debut single \"Hide and Seek\" propelled him into the spotlight, showcasing his raw talent and captivating flow.\n\nAt first listen, his 2024 single, \"Barbies\" can be confused as an ode to beautiful women, with lyrics like: \"All of them Barbie pretty.\" Listeners later realize the song is actually about guns and street life. \"The opps are wet and there's no disagreement / Ayy / fill up the wap / put teeth in.\"\n\nOdumodublvck\n\nNigerian rapper and singer Odumodublvck is crafting a lane for himself with an alluring Afro-grime and Afro-drill sound. As a member of the hip-hop collective Anti World Gangstars, Odumodublvck creates high-energy music which features catchy, repetitive lyrics in Pidgin English and his Native Nigerian language (Igbo).\n\nHis latest project, EZIOKWU, dropped in October 2023 and includes collaborations with acclaimed artists like Fireboy DML, Wale, and Amaarae — further cementing his position as a rising star in the evolving Nigerian music landscape.\n\nJay Hound\n\nJay Hound is an upcoming drill artist hailing from a section of Manhattan's Upper West Side neighborhood and catapulted into the spotlight via his 2023 single \"UKRAINE.\"\n\nA collaboration with his Sweepers labelmate Jay5ive, the track features deep and vibrating bass, and garnered over seven million views on YouTube and nearly 30 million streams on Spotify. He even released an Afro-drill version of the song, which deconstructs the grittiness of the original drill track for a more light and playful dance sound.\n\nLismar\n\nDominican singer/songwriter Lismar is dominating the Dominican urban music scene with her contemporary hip-hop and drill rap. Gaining recognition on the Puerto Rican platform Freestyle Mania, Lismar's creativity and distinctive sound of which infuses both Latin and hip-hop music has earned her a growing fan base and a deal with Roc Nation.\n\nIn her new released tracks \"Delincuente Con Traje\" and \"BZRP Music Session #60,\" she captivates listeners with her powerful flow and impactful lyrics that translate to \"I look calm / but I was raised on the corner\" and \"If they close the door / I knock down the window.\" The rapper dropped her latest single \"Mi Primer Concierto,\" a softer record that seamlessly integrates her Dominican heritage with rap.\n\nDee Billz\n\nNew York-based rapper, Dee Billz, combines bold and unapologetic lyrics while also toying with a Jersey club sound in his 2023 breakout hit \"Thootie.\" The single took the internet by storm and racked up more than a million views across TikTok and YouTube.\n\nLast year, the drill artist collaborated with fellow New Yorker rapper’s Kyle Richh, Jenn Carter, and Tata to release \"Stomp Stomp,\" a single that reimagines Soulja Boy's \"Crank That\" in a drill style.\n\nLatest Rap News & Music\n\nWhile significant attention was devoted to the celebration of hip-hop in 2023 — an acknowledgement of what is widely acknowledged as its 50th anniversary — another important anniversary in hip-hop is happening this year as well. Specifically, it’s been 30 years since 1994, when a new generation entered the music industry and set the genre on a course that in many ways continues until today.\n\nThere are many ways to look at 1994: lists of great albums (here’s a top 50 to get you started); a look back at what fans and tastemakers were actually listening to at the time; the best overlooked obscurities. But the best way to really understand why a single 365 three decades ago had such an impact is to narrow our focus to look at the important debut albums released that year.\n\nAn artist’s or group’s debut is their entry into the wider musical conversation, their first full statement about who they are and where in the landscape they see themselves. The debuts released in 1994 — which include the Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die, Nas' Illmatic and Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik from Outkast — were notable not only in their own right, but because of the insight they give us into wider trends in rap.\n\nRead on for some of the ways that 1994's debut records demonstrated what was happening in rap at the time, and showed us the way forward.\n\nHip-Hop Became More Than Just An East & West Coast Thing\n\nThe debut albums that moved rap music in 1994 were geographically varied, which was important for a music scene that was still, from a national perspective, largely tied to the media centers at the coasts. Yes, there were New York artists (Biggie and Nas most notably, as well as O.C., Jeru the Damaja, the Beatnuts, and Keith Murray). The West Coast G-funk domination, which began in late 1992 with Dr. Dre’s The Chronic, continued with Dre’s step brother Warren G.\n\nBut the huge number of important debuts from other places around the country in 1994 showed that rap music had developed mature scenes in multiple cities — scenes that fans from around the country were starting to pay significant attention to.\n\nTo begin with, there was Houston. The Geto Boys were arguably the first artists from the city to gain national attention (and controversy) several years prior. By 1994, the city’s scene had expanded enough to allow a variety of notable debuts, of wildly different styles, to make their way into the marketplace.\n\nRead more: A Guide To Texas Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Events\n\nThe Rap-A-Lot label that first brought the Geto Boys to the world’s attention branched out with Big Mike’s Somethin’ Serious and the Odd Squad’s Fadanuf Fa Erybody!! Both had bluesy, soulful sounds that were quickly becoming the label’s trademark — in no small part due to their main producers, N.O. Joe and Mike Dean. In addition, an entirely separate style centered around the slowed-down mixes of DJ Screw began to expand outside of the South Side with the debut release by Screwed Up Click member E.S.G.\n\nThere were also notable debut albums by artists and groups from Cleveland (Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Creepin on ah Come Up), Oakland (Saafir and Casual), and of course Atlanta — more about that last one later.\n\n1994 Saw The Pinnacle Of Boom-Bap\n\nPopularized by KRS-One’s 1993 album Return of the Boom Bap, the term \"boom bap\" started as an onomatopoeic way of referring to the sound of a standard rap drum pattern — the \"boom\" of a kick drum on the downbeat, followed by the \"bap\" of a snare on the backbeat.\n\nThe style that would grow to be associated with that name (though it was not much-used at the time) was at its apex in 1994. A handful of primarily East Coast producers and groups were beginning a new sonic conversation, using innovations like filtered bass lines while competing to see who could flip the now standard sample sources in ever-more creative ways.\n\nMost of the producers at the height of this style — DJ Premier, Buckwild, RZA, Large Professor, Pete Rock and the Beatnuts, to name a few — worked on notable debuts that year. Premier produced all of Jeru the Damaja’s The Sun Rises in the East. Buckwild helmed nearly the entirety of O.C.’s debut Word…Life. RZA was responsible for Method Man’s Tical. The Beatnuts took care of their own full-length Street Level. Easy Mo Bee and Premier both played a part in Biggie’s Ready to Die. And then there was Illmatic, which featured a veritable who’s who of production elites: Premier, L.E.S., Large Professor, Pete Rock, and Q-Tip.\n\nThe work the producers did on these records was some of the best of their respective careers. Even now, putting on tracks like O.C.’s \"Time’s Up\" (Buckwild), Jeru’s \"Come Clean\" (Premier), Meth’s \"Bring the Pain\" (RZA), Biggie’s \"The What\" (Easy Mo Bee), or Nas’ \"The World Is Yours\" (Pete Rock) will get heads nodding.\n\nMajor Releases Balanced Street Sounds & Commercial Appeal\n\n\"Rap is not pop/If you call it that, then stop,\" spit Q-Tip on 1991’s \"Check the Rhime.\" Two years later, De La Soul were adamant that \"It might blow up, but it won’t go pop.\" In 1994, the division between rap and pop — under attack at least since Biz Markie made something for the radio back in the ‘80s — began to collapse entirely thanks to the team of the Notorious B.I.G. and his label head and producer Sean \"Puffy\" Combs.\n\nBiggie was the hardcore rhymer who wanted to impress his peers while spitting about \"Party & Bulls—.\" Puff was the businessman who wanted his artist to sell millions and be on the radio. The result of their yin-and-yang was Ready to Die, an album that perfectly balanced these ambitions.\n\nThis template — hardcore songs like \"Machine Gun Funk\" for the die-hards, sing-a-longs like \"Juicy\" for the newly curious — is one that Big’s good friend Jay-Z would employ while climbing to his current iconic status.\n\nSolo Stars Broke Out Of Crews\n\nOne major thing that happened in 1994 is that new artists were created not out of whole cloth, but out of existing rap crews. Warren G exploded into stardom with his debut Regulate… G Funk Era. He came out of the Death Row Records axis — he was Dre’s stepbrother, and had been in a group with a pre-fame Snoop Dogg. Across the country, Method Man sprang out of the Wu-Tang collective and within a year had his own hit single with \"I’ll Be There For You/You’re All I Need To Get By.\"\n\nAnyone who listened to the Odd Squad’s album could tell that there was a group member bound for solo success: Devin the Dude. Keith Murray popped out of the Def Squad. Casual came out of the Bay Area’s Hieroglyphics.\n\nRead more: A Guide To Bay Area Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From Northern California\n\nThis would be the model for years to come: Create a group of artists and attempt, one by one, to break them out as stars. You could see it in Roc-a-fella, Ruff Ryders, and countless other crews towards the end of the ‘90s and the beginning of the new millennium.\n\nMulti-Producer Albums Began To Dominate\n\nIllmatic was not the first rap album to feature multiple prominent producers. However, it quickly became the most influential. The album’s near-universal critical acclaim — it earned a perfect five-mic score in The Source — meant that its strategy of gathering all of the top production talent together for one album would quickly become the standard.\n\nWithin less than a decade, the production credits on major rap albums would begin to look nearly identical: names like the Neptunes, Timbaland, Premier, Kanye West, and the Trackmasters would pop up on album after album. By the time Jay-Z said he’d get you \"bling like the Neptunes sound,\" it became de rigueur to have a Neptunes beat on your album, and to fill out the rest of the tracklist with other big names (and perhaps a few lesser-known ones to save money).\n\nThe South Got Something To Say\n\nIf there’s one city that can safely be said to be the center of rap music for the past decade or so, it’s Atlanta. While the ATL has had rappers of note since Shy-D and Raheem the Dream, it was a group that debuted in 1994 that really set the stage for the city’s takeover.\n\nOutkast’s Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was the work of two young, ambitious teenagers, along with the production collective Organized Noize. The group’s first video was directed by none other than Puffy. Biggie fell so in love with the city that he toyed with moving there.\n\nOutkast's debut album won Best New Artist and Best New Rap of the Year at the 1995 Source Awards, though the duo of André 3000 and Big Boi walked on stage to accept their award to a chorus of boos. The disrespect only pushed André to affirm the South's place on the rap map, famously telling the audience, \"The South got something to say.\"\n\nRead more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nOutkast’s success meant that they kept on making innovative albums for several more years, as did other members of their Dungeon Family crew. This brought energy and attention to the city, as did the success of Jermain Dupri’s So So Def label. Then came the \"snap\" movement of the 2000s, and of course trap music, which had its roots in aughts-era Atlanta artists like T.I. and producers like Shawty Redd and DJ Toomp.\n\nBut in the 2010s a new artist would make Atlanta explode, and he traced his lineage straight back to the Dungeon. Future is the first cousin of Organized Noize member Rico Wade, and was part of the so-called \"second generation\" of the Dungeon Family back when he went by \"Meathead.\" His world-beating success over the past decade-plus has been a cornerstone in Atlanta’s rise to the top of the rap world. Young Thug, who has cited Future as an influence, has sparked a veritable ecosystem of sound-alikes and proteges, some of whom have themselves gone on to be major artists.\n\nAtlanta’s reign at the top of the rap world, some theorize, may finally be coming to an end, at least in part because of police pressure. But the city has had a decade-plus run as the de facto capital of rap, and that’s thanks in no small part to Outkast.\n\nWhy 1998 Was Hip-Hop's Most Mature Year: From The Rise Of The Underground To Artist Masterworks"
