Score available from Amazon and iTunes.

“It’s about what children can teach you, if you let them.” This is what director Peter Hedges said to me when we met to discuss his movie. That was all I needed to start writing music.

I began by writing a piece called “Quirkington” right after I read the script but before I saw any footage. The idea was to capture the quirkiness of the film, coupled with Timothy’s innocent-but-wise persona. You can hear this piece, virtually unchanged from it’s original form as the main title for the film, retitled “You’re Gonna Find It Hard To Believe.”

From there, I explored thematic material for Jim and Cindy, who long for a child and, through sheer desire and a bit of magic, are able to wish one into existence. Jim and Cindy are hard working, salt of the earth people and I knew their music needed to be rooted in acoustic, organic and folky instrumentation like the piece “Life Goes On.”

And the third major element of the score is Joni’s music, embodied in “Love And Be Loved.” Here we have a very real, genuine relationship developing between two young people, both of whom are just a little bit odd.

Whenever I’ve finished a score, I’ve felt a sense of accomplishment for having left the movie in a better place than it was before I began. When I finished the score for The Odd Life of Timothy Green, I felt that this time the film left me a better person than I was before I began.

Bravo, and thank you to Peter Hedges, Mitchell Lieb, Andy Mondshein, Monica Zierhut, Dana Sano and Hans Zimmer for supporting me as I wrote this deeply personal score.

“Propelled by Geoff Zanelli’s stirring score, which blends folk instruments and human voices and natural sounds, Hedges’ treatment of the supernatural is easy to accept, and these interruptions help to put the pic’s magical realism in perspective.”

“Somehow though it feels like something clicked with The Odd Life Of Timothy Green. This thematically sound score reaches deep, and I mean deep. The music flows with heart and the central motif anchors it to make it memorable. The characters and emotions come through as clear as they can for a score that resonates with the listener. The music feels personal and you can feel Geoff’s voice in every note.”

“The homegrown, organic, rich, earthy feel of the movie is fostered by the sometimes Celtic-sounding, sometimes folk-ish, but definitely thought-provoking music.”

“By the time you get to that climax – beautifully shot by cinematographer John Toll and wonderfully scored by film composer Geoff Zanelli – you’ll end up like me: a tearful mess of a viewer, especially odd considering I never weep for anything at the movies.”

– Joseph Braverman, Awards Circuit

“It is the film’s earnestness that makes it so winning. In an era when irony seems to pervade our popular culture, Timothy Green’s unabashed innocence seems like something out of another time. It embraces its simplicity wholeheartedly, and emerges as something both deeply beautiful and completely charming. Shot in gorgeous, warm tones by John Toll (Braveheart, The Thin Red Line) and scored with disarming tenderness by Geoff Zanelli (The Pacific), The Odd Life of Timothy Green is anchored by a strong performance by newcomer CJ Adams in the title role.”

– From The Front Row
