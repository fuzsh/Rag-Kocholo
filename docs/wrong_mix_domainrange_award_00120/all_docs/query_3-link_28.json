His blockfront desks, secretaries, and cabinets usually have readily identifiable ogee bracket feet (also…\n\nblocking (clothing manufacturing)\n\nclothing and footwear industry: Blocking: Blocking consists of encompassing a form, block, or die with the garment with skintight precision. The item is blocked or pressed by superposing a complementary pressing form that sandwiches the shaped garment or section between the interlocked blocks. This process is used for such…\n\nblocking (wood processing)\n\nfurniture: Wood: …axially, radially, or tangentially; by blocking the wood—i.e., glueing pieces of wood together in different directions—such differences are eliminated and equal strength is obtained both longitudinally and laterally. The characteristic feature of laminated board is that the veneer on both sides encloses a wooden board composed of narrow strips of…\n\nblocking (sports)\n\nbasketball: Blocking: …in basketball include the following: Any illegal personal contact that impedes the progress of an opponent who does not have the ball.\n\nblocking (performance)\n\nstepping, a complex synchronized dancelike performance that blends African folk traditions with popular culture.

Desensitization can also be required when a penicillin-sensitive person, who may experience anaphylaxis after…\n\nblocking anticyclone (meteorology)\n\nSuperstorm Sandy: Origin and development of the superstorm: …strong high-pressure cell, called a blocking high, that stagnates over Greenland, and any eastward movement of storms behind the blocking high slows substantially.\n\nblocking high (meteorology)\n\nSuperstorm Sandy: Origin and development of the superstorm: …strong high-pressure cell, called a blocking high, that stagnates over Greenland, and any eastward movement of storms behind the blocking high slows substantially.\n\nblocking temperature\n\ndating: Multiple ages for a single rock: the thermal effect: …the mineral cools below the blocking temperature. (This is the temperature below which a mineral becomes a closed chemical system for a specific radioactive decay series. Accordingly, the parent-daughter isotope ratio indicates the time elapsed since that critical threshold was reached.) In this case, the host mineral could have an…\n\nblockout-stencil method (art)\n\nstenciling: In one method, called the blockout-, or glue-cutout-, stencil method, those parts of the screen that are to be stopped are filled with water-soluble glue.
