        "text": "A Selected Chronological Bibliography of Biology and Medicine\n\nPart 4A\n\n1925  1936\n\nCompiled by James Southworth Steen, Ph.D.\n\nDelta State University\n\nDedicated to my loving family\n\nThis document celebrates those secondary authors and laboratory technicians without whom most of this great labor of discovery would have proved impossible.\n\nPlease forward any editorial comments to: James S. Steen, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, jsteen08@bellsouth.net\n\n1925\n\n\"The key to every biological problem must finally be sought in the cell.\" Edmund Beecher Wilson {Wilson, 1925 #8391}.\n\nWhen we consider what religion is for mankind, and what science is, it is no exaggeration to say that the future course of history depends upon the decision of this generation as to the relations between them. Alfred North Whitehead {Whitehead, 1925 #14608}.\n\nAlmost all new ideas have a certain aspect of foolishness when they are first proposed. Alfred North Whitehead {Whitehead, 1925 #14608}.\n\nRichard Adolf Zsigmondy (AT-DE) received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his demonstration of the heterogeneous nature of colloid solutions and for the methods he used, which have since become fundamental in modern colloid chemistry. He developed a dark field ultra-microscope that could detect particles with diameters below the wavelengths of visible light.\n\nRonald Aylmer Fisher (GB-AU) invented the statistical method known as analysis of variance {Fisher, 1925 #8532}.\n\nWalter S. Abbott (US) developed a method for computing the effectiveness of insecticides {Abbott, 1925 #9320}.\n\nWilliam S. Hoffman (US) isolated adenine nucleotide in crystalline form from pig blood {Hoffman, 1925 #17088}.\n\nJohn Mason Gulland (GB) and Robert Robinson (GB) worked out the structure of morphine {Gulland, 1925 #12109}.\n\nTreat Baldwin Johnson (US) and Robert D. Cogshill (US) discovered the occurrence of 5-methylcytosine in nature (tubercle bacteria) {Johnson, 1925 #12112}.\n\nRollin Douglas Hotchkiss (US) and Gerard R. Wyatt (CA) discovered 5-methylcytosine in plant and animal tissues {Hotchkiss, 1948 #12113;Wyatt, 1951 #12114}.\n\nGottfried Koller (DE), Earle Bryant Perkins (US), Theodore Snook (US), and Benjamin Kropp (US) found that there is produced in the eyestalks of crustaceans a hormone which, when carried in the blood stream, is effective in inducing chromatophore changes. Koller named this hormone contractin {Koller, 1925 #16847;Koller, 1927 #17563;Koller, 1928 #19445;Perkins, 1928 #14588;Perkins, 1931 #19448;Perkins, 1932 #19449}.\n\nBernhard Zondek (DE-IL) and Benno Brahn (DE) isolated an estrogenic hormone from the ovarian follicle {Zondek, 1926 #3384;Zondek, 1925 #3383}.\n\nEdouard Chatton (FR) first used the terms prokaryote and eukaryote in his 1925 paper when he suggested that the most significant taxonomic distinction among life forms today is not between plants and animals but between cells with nuclei, eukaryotes, and cells without them, prokaryotes. Pro means before and eu means true, karyote refers to a nut or kernel {Chatton, 1925 #1958;Chatton, 1938 #6321}.Protozoologists agree today in considering the flagellated autotrophs the most primitive of the Protozoa possessing a true nucleus, Eukaryotes (a group which also includes the plants and the Metazoans), because they alone have the power to completely synthesize their protoplasm from a mineral milieu. Heterotrophic organisms are therefore dependent on them for their existence as well as on chemotrophic Prokaryotes and autotrophs (nitrifying and sulphurous bacteria, Cyanophyceae. This is a translation by Jan Sapp (CA) from the 1938 reference {Sapp, 2005 #19875}.\n\nEukaryotes are now placed in the domain Eucarya while prokaryotes are placed in either the domain Bacteria or Archaea.\n\nAndré Michel Lwoff (FR) used the word eukaryote {Lwoff, 1938 #16381}.\n\nEllsworth C. Dougherty (US) proposed the prokaryotic-eukaryotic dichotomy. He used the words eukaryon (Greek: true kernel) for the nucleus of higher organisms and prokaryon (Greek: before kernel) for the moneran nucleus. {Dougherty, 1957 #19872}.\n\nRoger Yate Stanier (CA) and Cornelis Bernardus Kees van Niel (NL-US) later defined bacteria by conceptualizing two new biological entities, \"prokaryotes\" and \"eukaryotes.\" They argued that the cells of all living things were either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, depending on their pattern of cellular organization. They defined eukaryotes as cells containing membrane-bound structures called organelles, the most important of which was the nucleus. By this definition, all cells of multi-cellular plants and animals were eukaryotes. Cells that lacked membrane-bound cell nuclei, like bacteria and blue-green algae, were designated prokaryotes. The term prokaryote implicitly elevated bacteria to equivalent biological status with all other organisms, to be known as eukaryotes {Stanier, 1962 #12332}. This represents the resurrection and embellishment of an idea first conceived by Edouard Chatton (FR).\n\nRobert George Everitt Murray (CA) proposed Procaryotae as a taxon at the highest level and described it as a kingdom of microbes characterized by the possession of nucleoplasm devoid of basic protein and not bounded from cytoplasm by a nuclear membrane. He suggested Eucaryotae as a possible taxon at the same level to include other protists, plants, and animals {Murray, 1968 #19874}.\n\nErwin Broun Fred (US), Ira Lawrence Baldwin (US) and Elizabeth McCoy (US) published the definitive text on nitrogen fixation {Fred, 1932 #19855}.\n\nAgnes Robertson Arber (GB) authored Monocotyledons; a Morphological Study, which developed the thesis, first suggested by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle (CH), that the monocot leaf is derived from a dicot petiole (phyllode theory) {Arber, 1925 #7465}.\n\nThurlow Nelson (US) implicated the ctenophore Mnemiopsis as a predator on oyster larvae in inland coastal waterways along the New Jersey coast {Nelson, 1925 #26750}.\n\nEmil-Karl Frey (DE) observed in 1925 a considerable reduction in arterial blood pressure when he injected human urine into dogs. Unlike many other contemporary scientists, he did not attribute this effect to a toxic action of urine, but rather as the specific activity of an unknown substance with potential biological functions {Frey, 1926a #19806;Frey, 1926b #19807}.\n\nHeinrich Kraut (DE), Emil-Karl Frey (DE) and Eugen Werle (DE) reasoned that, It is a substance that probably originates from several organs, is eliminated by the kidneys and has a pronounced cardioactive and vasoactive effect: a substance that is assigned the role of a hormone in the organism. This F-substance was then called kallikrein, since it was considered to have originated in the pancreas (Greek synonym: kallikreas) {Kraut, 1930 #19808}.\n\nEugen Werle (DE), W. Götze (DE), A. Keppler (DE), and M. Grunz (DE) identified kallikrein as a proteolytic enzyme (ferment) that liberates the biologically highly active, basic polypeptide DK or kallidin (i.e lys-bradykinin) from a blood plasma protein called kallidinogen or kininogen (H- and L-kininogen) {Werle, 1937 #2080;Werle, 1939 #2081}. Its name was later changed to kallidin and that of the precursor to kallidinogen. This work laid the foundation for understanding the system that we refer to today as the kallikrein-kinin system (cascade).\n\nGeorge Edward Briggs (GB) and John Burdon Sanderson Haldane (GB-IN) made important refinements in the theory of enzyme kinetics with their steady-state derivation of the single-substrate enzyme saturation curve {Briggs, 1925 #5527}.\n\nEarl Perry Cark (US) and James Bertram Collip (CA) reported an important improvement in the methodology for the determination of blood serum calcium {Clark, 1925 #9321}.\n\nCyrus Hartwell Fiske (US) and Yellapragada Subbarow (IN-US) developed a colorimetric method useful for the detection of phosphorus in organic material {Fiske, 1925 #9322}.\n\nEvert Gorter (NL) and Francois Grendel (NL) determined that the area of the monomolecular film formed on a Langmuir trough by the membrane lipids was double the surface area of the erythrocytes from which the lipids had been extracted, suggesting that the cell membrane is bimolecular {Gorter, 1925 #11048}. This was the first evidence that cell membranes are bi-layered.\n\nHans Molisch (CZ), in 1925, obtained the evolution of oxygen by illuminating preparations of dried leaves {Molisch, 1938 #6485}.\n\nGottfried Samuel Fraenkel (DE-US) discovered that statocysts on jellyfish medussa respond to gravity {Fraenkel, 1925 #26681}.\n\nWilliam Rowan (CH-GB-CA) tested the effect of photoperiodism on migratory drive and reproductive histology in birds. He proved that the annual cycle of changing day-length is the major stimulus for bird migration and is associated with profound physiological change within birds {Rowan, 1925 #12152;Rowan, 1926 #8935;Rowan, 1929 #26646;Rowan, 1931 #5184;Rowan, 1932 #26648}. Note: Before Rowan, it was unknown what environmental cues animals used to time the seasonal changes in their biology. See, Piersma, 1998.\n\nRobert Kyle Burns, Jr. (US) established the adequacy of the hormonal theory of sex determination as a general mechanism for vertebrates {Burns, 1925 #10572;Burns, 1939a #10573;Burns, 1939b #10574;Burns, 1939c #10575;Burns, 1942 #10576;Burns, 1955 #10577}. See Frank Rattray Lillie, 1916.\n\nCarl Ferdinand Cori (CZ-US) described the rapid absorption of galactose in the intestine, galactose being the most active sugar in this respect {Cori, 1925a #23141}.\n\nJosef von Halban (AT) and Robert Koehler (AT) proved that cessation of internal secretion of the corpus luteum is responsible for the menstrual bleeding in humans {von Halban, 1925 #23289}.\n\nErnest Henry Starling (GB) and Ernest Basil Verney (GB) isolated dog kidneys, which they supplied with oxygenated blood at controlled flow rates, temperature, and pressure. They found they could produce regular flow rates of normal urine. From their analysis of the urine they determined that the glomeruli generate a protein-free filtrate. They artificially blocked tubular metabolic activity with hydrocyanic acid, collected ureter filtrate, and found that water, chloride, bicarbonate, and glucose are normally reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate by the tubular cells. They also found that pituitrin (a proprietary preparation of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland) influenced the re-absorption mechanisms for water and chloride and that without it the mammalian kidney reverted to a urine characteristic of fish and amphibian classes {Starling, 1925 #3364}. Note: Vasopressin would later be isolated as the active ingredient in pituitrin.\n\nEdwin B. Hart (US), Harry Steenbock (US), Conrad Arnold Elvehjem (US), and James Waddell (US) demonstrated that when rabbits were induced into a state of anemia by milk diet, the addition of ferric salts alone was insufficient to bring about recovery. They discovered that the additional presence of copper is necessary for the animals to synthesize the pyrrol nucleus of hemoglobin {Hart, 1925 #3063;Hart, 1928 #3064}.\n\nLouis Sigurd Fridericia (DK) and Eiler Holm (DK) demonstrated that vitamin A (retinol) is necessary for normal night vision in rats. They also found that both the retinas of A-deficient rats and of rats whose eyes had been strongly illuminated were depleted of visual purple {Fridericia, 1925 #2934}.\n\nGaston Ramon (FR) and Pierre A. Descombey (FR) produced a tetanus vaccine from formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin {Ramon, 1925b #8239}.\n\nSimeon Burt Wolbach (US), Otto A. Bessey (US), and Percy R. Howe (US) concluded that vitamin A (retinol) deficiency in diets led to improper development of teeth and retardation of the growth of the skeleton and that vitamin C deficiency led to a deficiency of formation of intercellular cement substance leading to fragility of blood capillaries {Wolbach, 1925 #2944;Wolbach, 1926 #2980;Wolbach, 1928 #2945;Wolbach, 1933a #2946;Wolbach, 1933b #2947;Wolbach, 1941 #2943}.\n\nJ.H.C. Ruyter (NL) was the first to call attention to the structural peculiarities of unique cells lining the afferent arteriole as it approaches the glomerulus in mice and rats. He suggested that by swelling these cells could occlude the lumen of the afferent arterioles and thereby regulate blood flow to the glomerular capillaries {Ruyter, 1925 #6213}.\n\nCharles Oberling (FR) also reported a distinct group of cells at the same site, this time in the human kidney {Oberling, 1927 #25170}.\n\nNorbert Oscar Jean Goormaghtigh (BE) named the juxtaglomerular apparatus and suggested that it might have an endocrine function {Goormaghtigh, 1932 #6214}.\n\nNorbert Oscar Jean Goormaghtigh (BE) and Keith S. Grimson (US) confirmed that the modified cells in the afferent arteriolar wall of the juxtaglomerular apparatus are endocrine in nature {Goormaghtigh, 1937 #19785;Goormaghtigh, 1939a #16849;Goormaghtigh, 1939b #19787;Goormaghtigh, 1940a #16850;Goormaghtigh, 1940b #19786;Goormaghtigh, 1944 #16851;Goormaghtigh, 1945 #6215;Goormaghtigh, 1951 #19788}.\n\nGeorge White Pickering (US), Myron Prinzmetal (US), Juan Carlos Fasciolo (AR), Bernardo Alberto Houssay (AR), and Alberto C. Taquini (AR) rediscovered renin from the kidney as an inducer of hypertension {Pickering, 1938 #6209;Fasciolo, 1938 #7801}. See Tigerstedt, 1898.\n\nEduardo Braun-Menéndez (AR), Juan Carlos Fasciolo (AR), Luis Federico Leloir (AR), Juan M. Muñoz (AR), and Irvine Heinly Page (US) determined that renin is an enzyme which acts on a substrate (hypertensinogen) in the plasma converting it to a decapeptide (angiotensin I) {Braun-Menéndez, 1939 #6210;Page, 1939 #6211}.\n\nLeonard T. Skeggs, Jr. (US), Kenneth E. Lentz (US), Joseph R. Kahn (US), Norman P. Shumway (US), and Kenneth R. Woods (US) determined that a serum enzyme (angiotensinase) converts the inactive decapeptide (angiotensin I) to the active octapeptide (angiotensin II) {Skeggs, 1956 #6212}. This activity occurs primarily in the lungs.\n\nWilliam Stanley Peart (GB) demonstrated that the juxtaglomerular apparatus cells produce renin within the kidney {Peart, 1977 #16567}.\n\nHugo Fricke (US) measured the electrical capacitance of the surface membrane of erythrocytes, using a high-frequency alternating current bridge {Fricke, 1925a #11049;Fricke, 1925b #11050}.\n\nEdward M. East (US) and Albert J. Mangelsdorf (US), using Nicotiana tabacum as their research material, laid the foundation for understanding gametophytic self-incompatibility {East, 1925 #1985}.\n\nThomas Hunt Morgan (US), Calvin Blackman Bridges (US) and Alfred Henry Sturtevant (US) showed that chromosome imbalance could produce intersex types in Drosophila.\n\nThey also observed that occasionally crosses produced female-biased sex ratios, a clear violation of Mendels first law. Daughters from the distorted brood produced an equal number of males and females, but half of their sons produced female-biased sex ratios, whatever the origin of their mates. The remaining grandsons produced normal sex ratios and were shown to have lost the trait {Morgan, 1925 #1213}.\n\nDavid Policansky (US) and John Ellison (US) showed that in the Drosophila males producing biased sex ratio offspring there is a high mortality among sperm bearing the Y chromosome. They concluded that in some way a gene on the X chromosome kills sperm bearing a Y chromosome {Policansky, 1970 #6084}.\n\nFelix Bernstein (DE) proposed that the human ABO blood group is inherited in a multiple allele pattern {Bernstein, 1925 #14662}.\n\nHermann Joseph Muller, Jr. (US) reported on the mental traits and heredity as studied in a case of identical twins reared apart {Muller, 1925 #12347}.\n\nHoratio H. Newman (US), Frank N. Freeman (US), and Karl J. Holzinger (US) presented a large study of heredity and environment in the development of 100 pairs of twins {Newman, 1937 #12348}.\n\nSears P. Doolittle (US) and Lewis Ralph Jones (US) demonstrated that Macrosiphum pisi Harris (pea aphid) acts as a vector for pea mosaic virus {Doolittle, 1925 #1616}.\n\nHenri Vallée (FR), Henri Carré (FR), Paul Rinjard (FR), Otto Waldmann (DE), K. Kobe (DE), Gottfried Pyl (DE), Karl Otto Hobohm (DE), Hubert Moehlmann (DE), and H.S. Frenkel (NL) produced vaccines for foot-and-mouth disease {Frenkel, 1947 #25969;Frenkel, 1951 #25970;Vallée, 1925 #25967;Vallée, 1926 #26999;Waldmann, 1937 #25968;Waldmann, 1941 #25971}.\n\nCarl Hamilton Browning (GB) defined substances that incite the formation of antibodies and react with them as antigens {Browning, 1925 #97}.\n\nA smallpox epidemic emerged in Milwaukee, Wisconsin resulting in 386 cases, of whom 87 people died (about 23%). Of the 386 cases, 327 had never been vaccinated, 46 had been vaccinated 10 or more years previously, 11 had been vaccinated more than 5 and less than 10 years previously, 2 had an uncertain vaccination history, and none had been vaccinated within the previous 5 years. Health workers performed about 400,000 vaccinations during the epidemic, and officials enforced quarantine measures and isolation of those infected {Members, #26005}.\n\nJohn Cunningham (GB), working in India, found that the organism, Borrelia carteri, occurs in two antigenic varieties in human infections of relapsing fever {Cunningham, 1925 #98}. John Cunningham (GB), J.H. Theodore (GB), and A.G.L. Fraser (GB) extended the number of antigenic varieties to nine {Cunningham, 1934 #19791}.\n\nWilliam George Savage (GB) and Philip Bruce White (GB) laid the groundwork for antigenic analysis of the Salmonella group {Savage, 1925 #9086}.\n\nFritz Kaufmann (DK) greatly extended and refined Savage and Whites work {Kaufmann, 1954 #17828}.\n\nGaston Ramon (FR) demonstrated that it was possible to augment the antitoxin response to diphtheria and tetanus by administering vaccines with pyogenic bacteria or with various additional compounds (his favorite substance was tapioca). This represents the first occasion on which immunological adjuvants were used. Ramon called them adjuvantes et stimulantes de limmunite {Ramon, 1925a #2187}. Note: This discovery indicated a need to involve an inflammatory reaction at the antigen‐injection site to enhance the immune response.\n\nJules T. Freund (AT-HU-US), Jordi Casals-Ariet (ES-US), and Elizabeth Page Hosmer (US) proposed to add inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis to an oil-water emulsion, leading to the popular Freunds adjuvant {Freund, 1937 #23052}.\n\nJules T. Freund (AT-HU-US) and Katherine McDermott (US) made a variation in oil adjuvants, which allowed them to be used with any antigen. They emulsified water in oil with the assistance of a water-miscible lanolin-like material to incorporate both dried inactivated tubercle bacilli and the target antigen in a single aggregate preparation. This was the original Freunds complete adjuvant that provided a method for inducing antibody formation and cellular responses to substances that are weakly antigenic {Freund, 1942 #7307}.\n\nPorter Warren Anderson, Jr. (US) and David Hamilton Smith (US), Richard B. Johnston, Jr. (US), Michael E. Pichichero (US), Richard A. Insel (US), Robert Frank Betts (US), and Ronald J. Eby (US) made the first polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae to be tested in adults and infants {Anderson, 1972 #9669;Anderson, 1986 #9668}. They went on to develop a vaccine, which was a commercial success.\n\nLouis P. Rodriques (US), John B. Robbins (US) Rachel Schneerson (US), James C. Parke, Jr. (US), Clara Bell (US), James J. Schlesselman (US), Ann Sutton (US), Zhen Wang (US), Gerald Schiffman (US), Arthur Karpas (US), and Joseph Shiloach (US) studied the antigenicity of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polysaccharide then developed a clinically acceptable method of binding this polysaccharide to a medically useful protein, tetanus toxoid to form a conjugate vaccine. In sequential studies, their Hib-tetanus conjugate elicited protective levels in mice, rabbits, young rhesus monkeys, and then in human adults, children, and infants. Their achievement opened the door to their and others' development of conjugate vaccines for other bacterial pathogens whose surface polysaccharide could serve as a protective antigen {Rodrigues, 1971 #9670;Schneerson, 1971 #9671;Schneerson, 1986 #9672}.\n\nFrancoise Audibert (FR), Louis A. Chedid (FR), Pierre Lefrancier (FR), Jean Choay (FR), and Edgar Lederer (FR) revealed the smallest active adjuvant structure derived from the bacterial peptidoglycan, namely, the muramyl dipeptide {Audibert, 1977 #23053}.\n\nCharles A. Janeway, Jr. (US), in light of the function of adjuvants, redefined the immune response. What used to be defined as nonspecific immunity was renamed innate immunity. Innate immunity and inflammation are more or less two names for a similar mechanism, namely, the defense of the host against infectious or sterile insults {Janeway, 1989 #23051}.\n\nWilliam C. Boeck (US) and Jaroslav Drbohlav (US) were the first to develop in vitro cultures of Endamoeba histolytica. They grew it in a diphasic egg slant medium they developed for isolation of intestinal flagellates {Boeck, 1925 #2303}.\n\nHarold Robert Dew (AU) reported the histogenesis of the hydatid parasite (Taenia echinococcus) in the pig. He gave a very complete account of the earliest stages of development of the hydatid and of the tissue changes set up in the liver {Dew, 1925 #25140}.\n\nAlfred Stock (DE) wrote about the danger of mercury vapor and concluded that mercury is a poison, which can accumulate in the tissues over a considerable period of time {Stock, 1926 #14585}.\n\nMartha Schmidtmann (DE) by following the spread of dye in cardiac cells presented the first evidence for a direct intercellular pathway permeable to molecules {Schmidtmann, 1925 #10339}.\n\nWalther Vogt (DE) prepared a fate map that showed where the cells on the surface of an early gastrula would be in the later embryo. That is, he determined the destiny, or fate, of the gastrula cells {Vogt, 1925 #1103;Vogt, 1929 #16479}.\n\nNicole Le Douarin (FR), Claude Le Lièvre (FR), and Marie-Aimée Teillet (FR) used chick-quail chimeras to track the fate of neural crest cells and found that many of them migrate to form a variety of structures {Le Douarin, 1969 #15486;Le Douarin, 1970 #15487;Le Douarin, 1973 #15485}.\n\nCarl Ferdinand Cori (CZ -US) and Gerty Theresa Cori, née Radnitz (CZ -US) were the first to discover that tumors in the living animal show an abnormally high formation of lactic acid from glucose {Cori, 1925b #23142;Cori, 1925d #23143;Cori, 1925c #23144}. Note: Otto Heinrich Warburg (DE) had previously established that high aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis occurs in tumors in an in vitro environment.\n\nJohn Thomas Scopes (US) was the defendant in Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes, the so-called monkey trial held in Dayton, Tennessee in July 1925, in which a science teacher was arrested for teaching evolution in violation of the state laws at that time. Two-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan led the prosecution. Labor lawyer Clarence Darrow led the defense and goaded Bryan into declaring that humans are not mammals {Tompkins, 1965 #6488}.\n\nGeorge Hoyt Whipple (US), Frieda Saur Robscheit-Robbins (US), C. Arthur Elden (US), Warren M. Sperry (US), and George B. Walden (US) found that liver, heart, skeletal muscle, ash of liver, ash of kidney, and ash of pineapple promotes regeneration of hemoglobin following severe anemia {Whipple, 1925 #10566;Robscheit-Robbins, 1925 #10567;Robscheit-Robbins, 1927 #3060;Robscheit-Robbins, 1928 #10568;Robscheit-Robbins, 1929 #3061;Whipple, 1930 #10569}. These results suggested that iron in the diet is important for hemoglobin formation.\n\nThomas Benton Cooley (US) and Pearl Lee (US) reported on two Italian children with symptoms of severe anemia, enlarged spleens and livers, discolored skin and bone alterations {Cooley, 1925 #12164}. Thalassaemia or thalassemia\n\nGeorge Hoyt Whipple (US) and William Leslie Bradford (US) coined the word thalassaemia deriving it from two Greek words - Thalassa meaning the sea and haima meaning blood, literally \"sea water in the blood\" {Whipple, 1936 #12165}.\n\nGustav Riehl (DE) described a therapy for deep burn wounds {Riehl, 1925 #11765}.\n\nArnold Rice Rich (US) concluded that hemoglobin, derived from destroyed erythrocytes, is the sole source of bile pigment; its normal site of origin being in reticuloendothelial cells alone, especially the Kupffer cells, and the epithelial liver cells having no role in the formation, but only in the excretion of the bile pigment {Rich, 1925 #10103}.\n\nSanford M. Rosenthal (CA) and Edwin C. White (CA) introduced the bromsulphalein test for hepatic function with its attendant superiority over other tests for liver function {Rosenthal, 1925 #26577}.\n\nPercival Bailey (US) and Harvey Williams Cushing (US) postulated that medulloblastomas (Bailey coined this name) are derived from embryonic undifferentiated cells in the ependymal lining of the fourth ventricle. They described the characteristic gross and microscopic structure of this tumor, its reddish-gray color, extremely cellular nature, numerous mitotic figures, and the formation of pseudo rosettes. The tendency of this tumor to spread to the leptomeninges, which proved valuable in terms of treatment considerations, was noted. They recommended radiotherapy in the post-operative care of patients with medulloblastomas {Bailey, 1925 #16880;Bailey, 1948 #16881}.\n\nWalter Edward Dandy (US) reported a case in which he totally removed an acoustic neuroma. He used a unilateral sub-occipital approach during which, following gutting of the tumor, he gently drew the capsule away from the brainstem {Dandy, 1925 #12215}. Dandy's success was due in part to his innovation called ventriculography, which involved x-rays and injecting a gas into the brain's cerebral ventricles for visualizing the tumor. See, Dandy 1918.\n\nPercy Sargent (GB) was the first to remove a suprarenal tumor thus reversing virilism in the patient. Gordon Morgan Holmes (GB) described the operation {Holmes, 1925 #13321}.\n\nHenry Sessions Souttar (GB) performed a \"digital\" mitral commissurotomy (closed mitral valvulotomy) {Souttar, 1925 #7905}.\n\nGeoffrey Jefferson (GB) performed the first successful embolectomy in Britain {Jefferson, 1925 #14311}.\n\nKonstantine Michaelovich Bykov (RU) and Alexei Dmitriev Speranski (RU) were the first to demonstrate experimentally that the bilateral synergic activity of the hemispheres of the brain may be dependent on the corpus callosum and indicated the part the corpus callosum plays in the development of symmetrical reproduction of function in the hemispheres. He severed the corpus callosum in dogs and then used Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning methods to assess the effects of his surgeries. His experiments showed the importance of the corpus callosum for interhemispheric communication {Bykov, 1924-1925 #6613;Bykov, 1924 #6614}.\n\nHoward J. Curtis (US) and Archibald Philip Bard (US) used electrical stimulation to prove the point-to-point connection of one side of the cortex to the other by way of the corpus callosum {Curtis, 1939 #6615}.\n\nAndreas Vesalius (Flemish) gave the corpus callosum its name {Vesalius, 1543 #1044}.\n\nHoward Christian Naffziger (US) described the phenomenon of the pineal shift on skull x-rays, an important sign for brain tumor localization {Naffziger, 1925 #18232}.\n\nJohn Silas Lundy (US), in 1925, developed the concept of balanced anesthesia. He introduced the idea of combining more than one anesthetic techniquefor example, using morphine preoperatively, a regional block to the surgical site, alongside an inhalational anesthetic of ethylene {Lundy, 1926 #16853}.\n\nHermann Ludwig Blumgart (US) and Otto Christian Yens (US), in 1925, performed one of the most famous of all radiotracer experiments on humans, the well-known study of arm-to-arm circulation time {Blumgart, 1927 #20340}. This ushered in the field of nuclear medicine.\n\nMarius Nygaard Smith-Petersen (NO-US) introduced the three-flanged steel nail for insertion across the fracture site in hip fractures, an innovation that considerably improved recovery and mortality rates from hip fractures {Smith-Petersen, 1936 #25317}.\n\nWolfgang Köhler (DE) showed that instead of learning simply by trial and error chimpanzees can solve problems by grasping the relations between means and ends, i.e., they displayed insight {Köhler, 1925 #16568}.\n\nMerritt Lyndon Fernald (US) proved that in the northeastern United States some species of plants and animals persisted in areas that escaped glaciation during the Pleistocene {Fernald, 1925 #20630}.\n\nFritz Berckhemer (DE) found a fossil skull of a young female in the Sigrist gravel pit north of Stuttgart, Germany and gave it to Karl Sigrist {Berckhemer, 1925 #17130;Berckhemer, 1933 #17131}. This, so called, Steinheim skull can be considered a Homo erectus/Homo sapiens transitional form from the Middle Pleistocene, c. 1.3 M BP.\n\nRaymond Arthur Dart (AU-ZA) found in material from a limestone quarry at Taung (place of the lion), South Africa a fossil cast of the inside of a primate skull, which fitted into another lump of stone which possibly contained a face. It took Dart about a month to remove enough stone to reveal the face and jaw of a young fossil primate, which would be nicknamed the Taung baby. Dart considered the fossil an extinct race of apes intermediate between living anthropoids and man. He described it and named it Australopithecus africanus (Southern ape from Africa) and dated it to between 3 and 2.3 M {Dart, 1925 #6487}. Note: It was placed in the early Pleistocene or late Pliocene.This finding revolutionized ideas about early human evolution after human ancestors and apes split on the evolutionary tree.\n\nAustralopithecus africanus existed between 3 and 2 million years ago. It is like A. afarensis, and was also bipedal, but body size was slightly greater. Brain size may also have been slightly larger, ranging between 420 and 500 cc. This is a little larger than chimp brains (despite a similar body size), but still not advanced in the areas necessary for speech. The back teeth were a little bigger than in A. afarensis. Although the teeth and jaws of A. africanus are much larger than those of humans, they are far more like human teeth than to those of apes. The shape of the jaw is now fully parabolic, like that of humans, and the size of the canine teeth is further reduced compared to A. afarensis {Johanson, 1981 #7990;Coffing, 1994 #8748}.\n\nThe American Type Culture Collection was founded. It is a repository and source of known strains of viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae, and eukaryotic cells.\n\nArchivos de Neurobiologia, Psichologia, Fisiologia, Histologia, Neurologia y Psiquiatria, now titled Archivos de Neurobiologia was founded.\n\n1926\n\nMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earthmore than death. Thought is subversive, and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless to the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man. Bertrand Russell {Russell, 1926 #6727}.\n\nLife is bottled sunshine William Winwood Reade {Reade, 1926 #18984}.\n\nThe striking similarity established by Meyerhof between the changes of carbohydrates in muscle and in the yeast cell is seen to be much closer than has been believed. The remarkable phenomena accompanying alcoholic fermentation are now duplicated in the case of lactic acid production, and it may reasonably be expected that most of the fermentative decompositions of sugars will be found to be initiated in a similar manner. Arthur Harden {Harden, 1926 #9136}.\n\nThe characters of the individual are referable to paired elements (genes) in the germinal matter that are held together in a definite number of linkage groups . The members of each pair of genes separate when germ cells mature . Each germ-cell comes to contain only one set . These principles enable us to handle problems of genetics in a strictly numerical basis and allow us to predict what will occur . In these respects, the theory [of the gene] fulfills the requirements of a scientific theory in the fullest sense. It is difficult to resist the fascinating assumption that the gene is constant because it represents an organic chemical entity. This is the simplest assumption that one can make at present, and since this view is consistent with all that is known about the stability of the gene it seems, at least, a good working hypothesis. Thomas Hunt Morgan {Morgan, 1926 #612}.\n\nHarland W. Mossman (US) defined the placenta as \"apposition or fusion of the fetal membranes to the uterine mucosa for physiological exchange.\" {Mossman, 1926 #26860}\n\nTheodor Svedberg (SE) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on disperse systems.\n\nJohannes Andreas Grib Fibiger (DK) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research indicating that a nematode, Spiroptera carcinoma, caused gastric cancer in rats {Fibiger, 1914 #16373}. The hypothesis was later rejected but, nonetheless, had an important role in the development of experimental research on cancer.\n\nGilbert Newton Lewis (US) coined the term photon for the smallest unit of radiant energy {Lewis, 1926 #16842}.\n\nThe Commission on Units and Measurements defined the röntgen at the Second International Congress of Radiology in Stockholm, Sweden. It was based on ionization of air.\n\nWalter Norman Haworth (GB), William Charlton (GB), Stanley Peat (GB), John Vaughan Loach (GB), John Herbert Geoffrey Plant (GB), and Charles William Long (GB) had, by 1928, evolved and confirmed, among others, the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose and the glucoside ring structure of normal sugars {Charlton, 1926 #12207;Haworth, 1927a #12206;Haworth, 1927b #12208}.\n\nLeopold Stefan Ruzicka (HR-CH) analyzed civetone and muscone, two active compounds in natural musk perfumes and found that they consist of very large rings of atoms. He showed that civetone is composed of a 17-membered, and muscone a 15-membered carbon ring. At this time, it was thought that rings with over 6 members were too unstable to exist for long {Ruzicka, 1926 #9144}. This paper was submitted in 1924.\n\nKarl Lohmann (DE) and Lorand Jendrassik (HU) developed a colorimetric determination of phosphoric acid in muscle extracts {Lohmann, 1926 #9324}.\n\nFrancis Howard Carr (GB) and Ernest Arthur Price (GB) devised a test whereby color observed in samples of oils is a direct measure of vitamin A activity {Carr, 1926 #23364}.\n\nHans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin (DE-SE), Christian Barthel (LU), and Karl David Reinhold Myrbäck (SE) found that dried yeast possesses practically the same power of fermentation as fresh yeast although they retain only 1% of the reproductive power {Barthel, 1929 #9134;von Euler-Chelpin, 1926 #9133}.\n\nJulio Caesar Tello (PE) was inspired by the discovery in 1910 of the Paracas Textile (c. 100 BCE) at the site of Cabeza Larga on the Paracas Peninsula on the South coast of Peru. In his 1925 excavations Tello found coca leaves placed in an urn, which accompanied the burial of a Peruvian priest, noble, or king from the Nazca period. This is the earliest record of the use of cocoa leaves {Tello, 1926 #12549}.\n\nAlbert Jan Kluyver (NL) and Hendrick Jean Louis Donker (NL) wrote their treatise on the unity of biochemistry in which they stressed that biochemical mechanisms can be investigated using mutant strains of microorganisms and that hydrogen transfer is a basic feature of all metabolic processes {Kluyver, 1926 #99}.\n\nJuda Hirsch Quastel (GB-CA) and Barnet Woolf (GB) published the first reported measurementof the equilibrium constant of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. It was on the aspartateammonia-lyase reaction {Quastel, 1926b #16112}.\n\nJames Batcheller Sumner (US) was the first to obtain an enzyme in pure crystalline form. This was the enzyme urease, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield carbon dioxide and ammonia. Sumner had used a 32% solution of acetone in water to precipitate much of the organic material in a jack-bean extract rich in urease activity, while leaving most of the urease activity in solution. After filtering off this precipitate and letting the filtrate stand overnight in the cold, he found that crystals of protein had formed in the filtrate. Study of these protein crystals revealed that they are pure urease enzyme endowed with a specific enzymatic activity enormously greater than that of the original jack-bean extract. It was thus proven that the enzyme urease is a protein and that a polypeptide chain can act as a catalyst in the facilitation of a chemical reaction.\n\nSumners proof was an important milestone along the road to understanding the chemical basis of cell function {Sumner, 1926 #24263}.\n\nJohn Jacob Abel (US) crystallized insulin {Abel, 1926 #12171}.\n\nAnna L. Sommer (US) and Charles B. Lipman (US) experimentally demonstrated the essential nature of zinc, copper, and boron for plant growth {Sommer, 1926 #18503;Sommer, 1931 #18504}.\n\nAlfred Henry Sturtevant (US) found that inversion of a section of the third chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster reduces crossover frequency {Sturtevant, 1926 #12353}.\n\nHugo W. Alberts (US) devised a method for calculating genetic linkage values {Alberts, 1926 #22108}.\n\nCalvin Blackman Bridges (US) and Tomasz M. Olbrycht (PL) noted that to accurately construct genetic maps it is necessary to know the full number of crossovers (doubles counting as two crossovers, triples as three crossovers) that occur between the loci that are to be mapped. In constructing such maps, it is first necessary to determine experimentally the amounts by which the various crossing over values exceed the directly observed recombination percents. The experimental determination of the amount by which crossing over exceeds recombination is made through use of loci lying between the two loci in question. Bridges created the sc ec ct v g fmultiple recessive and called it \"Xple\" (X-chromosome multiple). This organism was used to test many aspects of linkage mapping {Bridges, 1926 #22118}.\n\nEdgar Altenburg (US) and Hermann J. Muller (US) demonstrated the nature of the mechanism of inheritance of the truncate character in Drosophila. They showed that it conformed regularly to the principles of chromosome heredity, factor constancy, etc., and disclosed the causes of the inconstancy of the inbred stock, and of the indefiniteness and variability of the ratios thrown in crosses.The truncate character, when it was analyzed, was found to depend on so many factors. 1) Two successive mutations were practically necessary, in the first place, before truncate became visible at all. 2)Since truncate depended on a lethal, and was, in addition, inconstant in somatic expression, it was subjected to selection, which perpetuated any new factors (balancing lethals and intensifiers) that still further differentiated truncate from normal. 3) Since the truncate character depended on an unstable developmental reaction, the initial appearance of such intensifiers was made more likely {Altenburg, 1920 #22109}.\n\nEdgar Douglas Adrian (GB) and Yngve Zotterman (SE), using the afferent nerve of a stretch receptor in a frog muscle, showed that it is possible by amplification to record the impulses in single nerve cells to a natural stimulus (tension). They postulated the concept of adaptation of receptors to stimuli and predicted that other units of the nervous system would also exhibit adaptation {Adrian, 1926 #3286}.\n\nEdgar Douglas Adrian (GB) and Yngve Zotterman (SE), established beyond doubt that the nerve impulse is invariant, that the intensity of sensation is conveyed by the frequency of impulses and the quality by the type of nerve fiber in action {Adrian, 1926 #3286}.\n\nEugene Markley Landis (US), Schack August Steenberg Krogh (DK), and Abbey H. Turner (US), in an elegant series of experiments, determined that the rate of net fluid movement across the capillary wall is proportional to the difference between capillary hydrostatic pressure and the osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins, thus providing the first experimental proof of Ernest Starlings hypothesis of fluid exchange. Landiss constant of proportionality was the first quantitative measurement of the hydrodynamic conductance of the capillary wall (cubic microns of fluid per second per centimeter water pressure difference per square micrometer of capillary wall). These papers included the first measurements of the pressure drops along the vascular tree and localization of the separate components of the peripheral resistance to blood flow, in mammals as well as frogs {Landis, 1926a #3233;Landis, 1926b #10615;Landis, 1927a #10617;Landis, 1927b #10618;Landis, 1927c #10620;Landis, 1928 #10621;Landis, 1930a #10622;Landis, 1930b #10623;Landis, 1930c #10624;Landis, 1931 #10625;Krogh, 1932 #10626;Landis, 1933a #10627;Landis, 1933b #10628;Landis, 1934 #10629}. See, Starling 1896.\n\nJohn Belling (GB-US) perfected the aceto-carmine staining method by adding iron. This technique was especially important because it allowed a clear differentiation between chromosomes and cytoplasm {Belling, 1926 #1204}.\n\nWalter Bradford Cannon (US) coined the word homeostasis: the maintenance of balance in the bodys state via chemical feedback mechanisms {Cannon, 1926 #3343;Cannon, 1932 #1435}. See, Claude Bernard (FR) for his concept called milieu intérieur, 1865. See, Alcmaèon (GR) for his concept called isonomy, 520 BCE\n\nGaston Ramon (FR) and Pierre A. Descombey (FR) described the flocculation reaction and observed that flocculation may occur in zones that do not correspond to the point at which the toxin and antitoxin neutralize each other {Ramon, 1926a #7078}.\n\nKenjiró Fujii (JP) observed the coiled structure of the chromosome for the first time noting that in certain stages of the cell cycle, two filaments appeared to be coiled around one another {Fujii, 1926 #19062}.\n\nFrantisek Vejdovsky (CZ) showed that nuclear fission in an ovule is preceded by the splitting of the centrosome (which he called the periplast); he was apparently the first to observe the centriole in 1866 {Vejdovsky, 1926-1927 #7389}.\n\nFélix Hubert dHerelle (CA) described the three-step process for the life history of the bacteriophage virus: (1) attachment to the susceptible bacterium, (2) multiplication in the cell, and (3) disintegration of the cell to set free the progeny virus particles and attachment of the progeny to other susceptible bacteria, if such are present. These conclusions were based on the plaque-count, and dilution methods of assay that he had invented {d'Herelle, 1926 #101}.\n\nLouis Otto Kunkel (US) demonstrated that Cicadula sexnotata (a leafhopper) could act as a vector of aster yellows virus {Kunkel, 1926 #1612}.\n\nThomas Clifford Vanterpool (CA) was the first to discover that mixed infections, the simultaneous occurrence of two viruses within a host plant acting together, could produce a distinct severe disease. He showed that tomato mosaic virus and potato mosaic virus acting together caused the severe disease of tomatoes called streak or winter blight while either virus acting alone was shown to cause mild symptoms {Vanterpool, 1926 #5718}.\n\nAndre Paillot (FR) discovered granulosis virus (GV) infection in an insect, Pieris brassicae (cabbage butterfly). He was the first to describe a new group of diseases, the granuloses, which are characterized by the formation of virus inclusion bodies called granules within tissues of infected insects {Paillot, 1926 #5719}. These are now considered Baculovirus.\n\nFrederik Kraneveld (NL) and Thomas M. Doyle (GB) discovered Newcastle disease virus {Doyle, 1927 #25963;Kraneveld, 1926 #25964}. Note: first paramyxovirus\n\nWilliam Edwin Cotton (US), Peter K. Olitsky (US), Jacob Traum (US), and Harry W. Schoening (US) discovered vesicular stomatitis viruses {Olitsky, 1926 #25965;Cotton, 1926 #25966}.\n\nPatrick Playfair Laidlaw (GB) and George William Dunkin (GB) established the viral etiology of canine distemper {Laidlaw, 1926 #25988}.\n\nEdson Sunderland Bastin (US) succeeded in culturing sulfate-reducing bacteria from groundwater samples extracted from an oil deposit that was hundreds of meters below the surface. Since this discovery over 9,000 strains of bacteria and fungi have been isolated from diverse subsurface environments {Bastin, 1926 #12172;Fredrickson, 1996 #681}.\n\nHeinrich Bernward Prell (DE) reported an amoebic infection of an insect, Apis mellifera Linn. (honeybee). The etiological agent he described and named Malpighamoeba mellificae attacks the Malpighian tubules causing a dysentery {Prell, 1926a #16843;Prell, 1926b #7150}.\n\nWalter H. Burkholder (US) observed that halo blight of beans is caused by Pseudomonas phaseolicola {Burkholder, 1926 #102}.\n\nEveritt George Dunne Murray (CA), Robert Alexander Webb (GB), and Meredith Blake Robson Swann (GB) isolated and characterized Listeria monocytogenes as the etiological agent of an epizootic among laboratory rabbits and guinea pigs, which was characterized in part by monocytosis {Murray, 1926 #2248}.\n\nWalter F. Schlech III (US), Pierre M. Lavigne (US), Robert A. Bortolussi (US), Alexander C. Allen (US), E. Vanora Haldane (US), A. John Wort (US), Allen W. Hightower (US), Scott E. Johnson (US), Stanley H. King (US), Eric S. Nicholls (US), and Clare V. Broome (US) established that human consumption of Listeria-contaminated foodstuffs causes a disease called listeriosis {Schlech, 1983 #8238}.\n\nLouis Edmond den Dooren de Jong (NL) demonstrated that a strain of Pseudomonas putida can proliferate on a mineral medium to which any one of some eighty compounds was added as the sole organic substance available {de Jong, 1926 #12174}.\n\nMaurice Lemoigne (FR) originally discovered poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) as a major component of the cells of the bacterium Bacillus megaterium {Lemoigne, 1926 #12178}.\n\nFrederick P. Delafield (US), Michael Doudoroff (US), Norberto J. Palleroni (US), Carol Jean Lusty (US) and Rebecca Contopoulos (US) later honored Lemoigne by naming Pseudomonas lemoigne, an active oxidizer of extracellular PHB, for him {Delafield, 1965 #12179}.\n\nFrank W. Tilley (US) and Jacob M. Schaffer (US) determined that the germicidal activity of the aliphatic alcohols increases regularly from methyl through octyl alcohol for each additional methyl group in the straight chain {Tilley, 1926 #8015;Schaffer, 1927 #12173}.\n\nSamuel Ottmar Mast (US) proposed the tail contraction model to explain sol-gel amoeboid movement {Mast, 1926 #12166}.\n\nJohn Nathaniel Couch (US) described for the first time the existence of physiologically distinct and separate male and female strains in an oomycete (Dictyuchus) {Couch, 1926 #10677}.\n\nFriedrich Seidel (DE), using eggs of the dragonfly, Platycnemis pennipes, determined that embryonic development in insects is typified by the presence of a special kind of germ-band formation. Because of the distribution of cytoplasm and yolk in the egg the germ band is limited to a particular region. The ventral portion of the developing embryo is special because it is the carrier of the main system of organs. The ventral part of the embryo precedes the dorsal side in development {Seidel, 1926 #7228;Seidel, 1928 #7229;Seidel, 1971a #7227}.\n\nAlden B. Dawson (US) carried out the first successful skeletal staining when he used alizarin red S {Dawson, 1926 #9323}.\n\nHenry Allan Gleason (US) argued that every plant association is the unique product of the fluctuating environmental conditions of a particular time and place {Gleason, 1926 #8306}.\n\nGavin Rylands de Beer (GB) observed that certain cartilage and bone cells are derived from the outer ectodermal layer of the embryo; calling into question the germ-layer theory {de Beer, 1926 #8970}.\n\nLloyd R. Watson (US) devised instrumental methods to artificially inseminate the honeybee {Cale, 1926 #1890;Watson, 1927 #1891;Watson, 1928 #1892}. This instrument greatly improved genetics of the honeybee.\n\nSergei Sergeevich Chetverikov (RU) concluded that populations in nature maintain within themselves the variants, which arise within them by mutation. This would provide them with a supply of potential but hidden variability out of which the adaptiveness of the population to a changing environment could arise {Chetverikov, 1926 #5044;Chetverikov, 1961 #12175}. Note: Together with Ronald Aylmer Fisher, John Burdon Sanderson Haldane, and Sewall Green Wright, Chetverikov is now regarded as one of the founders of population genetics and modern evolutionary theory.\n\nWilliam Bloom (US) worked out the early stages of the embryogenesis of human bile capillaries {Bloom, 1926a #10667}.\n\nWilliam Bloom (US) described the transformation of small lymphocytes into myelocytes in germinal centers {Bloom, 1926b #10668}.\n\nGeorge Ellett Coghill (US), in his studies of the amphibian Amblystoma punctatum, established that innervation develops in a cephalo-caudal (head-tail) direction, and that limb movements emerge from a more general pattern of trunk movement. He then theorized that behavior develops as the expansion of a \"total pattern,\" rather than simply as the combination or coordination of reflexes and suggested strongly that this might well be true for higher vertebrates, including man {Coghill, 1926 #12189;Coghill, 1929 #12188;Coghill, 1930 #12190;Coghill, 1931 #12191}.\n\nSerguei Metalnikov (RU-FR) and Victor Chorine (FR) provided an important paper in psychoneuroimmunology when they adapted Pavlovs procedures of stimulant conditioning to activate and enhance cellular and antibody immune responses to foreign substances, particularly to otherwise lethal doses of cholera and anthrax bacteria {Metalnikov, 1926 #7313}.\n\nRalph Milton Waters (US) authored a landmark article on carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption in anesthesiology {Waters, 1926 #12303}.\n\nKarl Ernest Mason (US), working with the rat, was the first to associate testicular degeneration and hence male infertility with vitamin E deficiency {Mason, 1926 #23428}.\n\nHarold S. Olcott (US) and Henry A. Mattill (US) fractionated the oil of lettuce and found that one fraction had high antioxidant power and high potency as a source of vitamin E {Olcott, 1931 #3069}.\n\nHerbert McLean Evans (US), Oliver H. Emerson (US), and Gladys A. Emerson (US) isolated alpha-tocopherol from wheat germ oil and discovered that it is synonymous with vitamin E {Evans, 1936 #3068}.\n\nErhard Robert Fernholz (US) determined the structure of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) {Fernholz, 1938 #13690}.\n\nPaul Karrer (RU-CH), Hans Heinrich Fritzsche (CH), Beat Heinrich Ringier (CH), and H. Salomon (CH) synthesized alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and proved its biological role as a vitamin {Karrer, 1938 #3070}.\n\nWells Phillips Eagleton (US) described cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis in relation to septicemia {Eagleton, 1926 #22634}.\n\nGiovanni Di Guglielmo (IT) described a syndrome of unknown origin characterized by enormous numbers of nucleated erythrocytes appearing in the bone marrow and blood (acute erythroblastosis) {Di Guglielmo, 1926 #13294}.\n\nErik Adolf Willebrand (FI) described a previously unknown form of hemophilia with a prolonged bleeding time course as its most prominent sign. He named it pseudo-hemophilia {Willebrand, 1926 #13571;von Willebrand, 1931 #13572;Willebrand, 1939 #13573}. Note: Later called Willebrands disease I\n\nNikolai Mikhailovich Itsenko (RU) described glucocorticoid excess syndrome in which the hypersecretion of glucocorticoids is secondary to hypersecretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone from the pituitary. It may also be caused by a basophilic adenoma of the pituitary {Itsenko, 1926 #13338}.\n\nHarvey Williams Cushing (US) described this syndrome six years later {Cushing, 1932b #11778}. It is often called Cushings syndrome I but should be called Itsenko-Cushing syndrome.\n\nFelix Mandl (AT) was the first to undertake parathyroid surgery, successfully removing a parathyroid adenoma in a patient with osteitis fibrosa cystica {Mandl, 1926 #12751}.\n\nHenry Head (GB) presented his theory of aphasia as a condition with, a disorder of symbolic formulation and expression {Head, 1926 #13306}.\n\nCésar Roux (CH) performed the first surgical resection of a pheochromocytoma, in 1926 {Manger, 1977 #13827}. Later the same year, Charles Horace Mayo (US) performed the first surgical resection in the United States and described medical and surgical management of pheochromocytoma {Mayo, 1927 #11548}.\n\nPercival Bailey (US) and Harvey Williams Cushing (US) wrote a book, which formed the basis of modern day neurooncology. It completely revolutionized the understanding of neurooncology, and for first time the neurosurgical community was presented with an orderly classification of gliomas based on the tumor's natural history and clinical course. This work changed antiquated thinking by showing that the microscopic structure of a tumor is important for prognosis. It completely revamped the understanding of these tumors. In fact, the histopathological basis of brain tumors in relation to patient survival rate and outcome still influences present-day neurosurgical thought {Bailey, 1926 #16877}.\n\nPercival Bailey (US) simplified, refined, and made the concepts presented in the 1926 book more practical {Bailey, 1927a #16878;Bailey, 1927b #16879}.\n\nHarvey Williams Cushing (US) and William T. Bovie (US) conceived and introduced electrosurgery, which allowed the cutting of tissue with almost no bleeding. During 1927, Cushing removed a number of brain tumors previously considered inoperable {Cushing, 1928a #12094;Riedman, 1962 #7656}.\n\nMaximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (DE), in 1896, developed an operating cystoscope fitted with an electric cautery {Nitze, 1907 #16845}.\n\nFrancis Bertody Sumner (US) made a thorough study of coat color among the mainland and Santa Rosa Island mice and concluded that both isolation and natural selection probably operated in the origin of species, but that environmental mechanisms could not be ruled out. Though still not conclusive, Sumners reading of natures experiments on Santa Rosa came closer than any other study at the time  field or lab  to providing empirical evidence of the mechanism of evolution. Santa Rosa is an island off the Florida panhandle {Sumner, 1926 #24263}.\n\nKnud Haraldsen Krabbe (DK) founded the journal Acta Psychiatrica et Neurologica Scandinavica.\n\n1927\n\nHeinrich Otto Wieland (DE) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his investigations of the constitution of the bile acids and related substances.\n\nJulius Wagner-Jauregg (AT) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of fever therapy for paresis (dementia paralytica). He shared the honor with the pathologist Johannes Andreas Grib Fibiger (DK), who was awarded the prize \"for his discovery of the Spiroptery carcinoma.\"\n\nGeorges Henri Joseph Édouard Lemaitre (BE) proposed the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. He visualized a primal atom, an incredibly dense egg containing all the material for the universe within a sphere about 30 times larger than the Sun. This primal atom exploded some 20-60 Ga scattering matter and energy in all direction {Lemaitre , 1927 #23561;Lemaitre, 1946 #8990}. This theory is now known popularly as the Big Bang Theory, a phrase coined by Fred Hoyle (GB) in a moment of facetiousness, during a radio broadcast {Hoyle, 1950 #16385}. Note: Alexander Friedmann (RU) proposed an expanding universe as early as 1922 {Belenkiy, 2012 #23562}. Note: Today, most physicists and cosmologists conceive of the primal atom as having been smaller than Lemaitre's!\n\nAlexander Logie du Toit (ZA) compared the geology of South America and South Africa and found them to be similar in many ways {du Toit, 1927 #7390}.\n\nHans Busch (DE) theorized that magnetic fields could act as lenses by focusing electron beams to a point {Busch, 1927 #12168}. This was vital to the invention of the electron microscope.\n\nHermann Joseph Muller, Jr. (US) and Lewis John Stadler (US) discovered that x-rays induce mutations in animals and plants respectively. They found that the dose-frequency curve is linear {Muller, 1927 #539;Stadler, 1928a #540;Stadler, 1928b #14665}. Note: here there is emplied that somatic mutations initiate cancer\n\nAlbert Charles Chibnall (GB) and Harold John Channon (GB) discovered the exact structure of phosphatidic acid; described for the first time in living materials {Chibnall, 1927 #12110}.\n\nOtto Knut Olof Folin (SE-US) and Vintila Ciocalteu (RO) designed the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent to detect phenolic and antioxidant polyphenols {Folin, 1927 #9325}. Note: This work used the now famous Folin-Ciocalteu reagent.\n\nRudolph John Anderson (SE-US) isolated the various lipoid and carbohydrate fractions from the tubercle bacillus. He was able to separate the lipoid constituents of tubercle bacilli into three groups consisting of wax, glycerides, and phosphatides {Anderson, 1927 #21462}.\n\nRudolph John Anderson (SE-US) described the constitution of phthiocol, a fat-soluble pigment he isolated from human tubercle bacillus. He determined that this previously unknown substance was in fact 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-1, 4-naphthaquinone {Anderson, 1933 #21463}.\n\nOtto Fritz Meyerhof (DE-US) discovered that the first step in the fermentation of glucose (glucose → glucose-6-phosphate), catalyzed by an enzyme he called hexokinase, does not require inorganic phosphate but rather organic phosphate transferred from its terminal, or g position on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) {Meyerhof, 1927 #8347}.\n\nOtto Fritz Meyerhof (DE-US) and Fritz Albert Lipmann (DE-US) discovered that sodium fluoride strongly inhibits the fermentation and phosphorylation of hexoses {Meyerhof, 1927 #8347;Lipmann, 1928 #8346}.\n\nHans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin (DE-SE), Erich Adler (), Otto Fritz Meyerhof (DE-US), Sidney P. Colowick (US), and Herman Moritz Kalckar (DK-US) partially purified hexokinase then established the reaction which it catalyzes as: glucose + adenosine triphosphate (ATP) à glucose 6-phosphate + adenosine diphosphate (ADP) {Colowick, 1943 #11012;Meyerhof, 1935e #20835;von Euler-Chelpin, 1935d #20836}\n\nHans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin (DE-SE) ws the first to show that the combination between an enzyme and a substrate can be traced back to a certain atomic group. He was experimenting with dipeptidases in which a carbonyl group is the site of combination {von Euler-Chelpin, 1927a #9132;von Euler-Chelpin, 1927b #23232}.\n\nJuda Hirsch Quastel (GB-CA) and Walter Reginald Wooldridge (GB) studied dehydrogenases from Escherichia coli and further developed the concept of the active center, or site of activation, a term earlier coined by Quastel (1926). This work stressed the importance of using in vitro results to understand in vivo activities of enzymes {Quastel, 1927 #5547}. They also discovered that malonic acid is a powerful inhibitor of succinic dehydrogenase {Quastel, 1928 #5548}.\n\nPhilip Eggleton (GB) and Marion Grace Palmer Eggleton (GB) found an organic acid-labile phosphate in muscle tissue. They named it phosphagen (phosphocreatine) and established the fact that muscular contraction is accompanied by removal of phosphagen, and subsequent recovery in oxygen is characterized by a rapid restitution of the phosphagena phase of recovery apparently independent of the relatively slow oxidative removal of lactic acid {Eggleton, 1927 #3045}.\n\nCyrus Hartwell Fiske (US) and Yellapragada SubbaRow (IN-US) discovered the chemical nature of the phosphagen (phosphocreatine) present in muscles. They announced that voluntary muscle contains an unstable compound of creatine and phosphoric acid, which is hydrolyzed by stimulation, and resynthesized when the muscle is permitted to recover. They proposed a structure and pointed out some of the physiological properties of phosphocreatine (later changed to creatine phosphate) {Fiske, 1927 #1729;Fiske, 1928 #1730;Fiske, 1929b #1731}. Note: Michel-Eugène Chevreul (FR), in 1832, determined that muscle contains creatine {Chevreul, 1835 #19064}.\n\nBernhard Zondek (DE-IL) and Selmar Aschheim (DE) isolated estrogenic hormone from the urine of pregnant women in amounts averaging 12,000 mouse units per liter {Zondek, 1927 #3385}. They found that the urine of pregnant women, when injected into female animals, caused hyperemia of the ovaries, growth of the follicles, and, in some species ovulation {Aschheim, 1928b #13064}. This became the basis of the Ascheim-Zondek and Friedman-Lapham Tests for pregnancy.\n\nMaurice Harold Friedman (US) and Maxwell Edward Lapham (US) developed the \"Rabbit test\" for early diagnosis of pregnancy. Two morning samples of urine were injected into the marginal ear vein of a virginal female rabbit that had been isolated from male rabbits. The result was available 48 hours after the first injection. Of all the biologic tests, Friedman's was the most accurate. This procedure tested for the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; a hormone released from the implantation site of a blastocyst that prevents menstruation) in the urine of women. If hCG were present in the urine, the rabbit's ovaries would form corpora lutea (ovarian endocrine structures formed following ovulation) within 48 hours {Friedman, 1929 #19066;Friedman, 1931 #19065}.\n\nJulius Moses Rogoff (US) and George Neil Stewart (US) demonstrated that a chemical extract of the adrenal glands of dogs greatly prolongs the lifespan of adrenalectomized dogs. They found that the active ingredient was not epinephrine (adrenaline) {Rogoff, 1927 #3402}. They experienced some success in using adrenal extract to treat human patients suffering from Addisons disease {Rogoff, 1929 #3403}. Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard (FR) had proved that removal of both suprarenal (adrenal) glands invariably proved fatal. See, Brown-Séquard, 1856.\n\nWalter Bradford Cannon (US), Andries Querido (NL), Sydney W. Britton (US), and Elizabeth M. Bright (US) demonstrated that the adrenal glands produce more adrenaline (epinephrine) in animals exposed to the cold. The adrenaline (epinephrine) causes an increase in heat production {Cannon, 1927 #3349}.\n\nJoseph Barcroft (GB) and John G. Stephens (GB) demonstrated the spleen's role as a blood reservoir in the dog {Barcroft, 1927 #12153}.\n\nThomas Milton Rivers (US) clearly distinguished between bacteria and viruses, thereby, giving rise to the field of virology {Rivers, 1927 #8809}.\n\nNicolaas Louis Söhngen (NL) was probably the first to report bacteria that lyse other bacteria, in some cases with a high degree of parasite-host specificity. Bacterium bacteriovorus, which lyses Bacillus danicus, he found to grow only in the presence of its host {Söhngen, 1927 #8653}.\n\nRonald Aylmer Fisher (GB-AU) explained the evolution of Batesian mimicry by a series of small evolutionary steps. He proposed that the phenotypic expression of genes could be modified by the action of other genes. Rare imperfect mimetic forms when they appeared in a population would vary due to the action of modifier genes. Selection would favor those modifier genes that produced an increase in the accuracy of the mimicry {Fisher, 1927 #6071}.\n\nCyril Astley Clarke (GB), Philip Macdonald Sheppard (GB), and Lawrence M. Cook (GB) provided experimental evidence to support Fishers explanation {Clarke, 1959a #6073;Clarke, 1959b #6074;Clarke, 1960a #6075;Clarke, 1960b #6076;Clarke, 1962 #6077;Clarke, 1963a #6072;Sheppard, 1962 #6078}.\n\nJohn Charles Walker (US) pioneered research on genetic resistance in yellows disease of cabbage. He showed the scientific community that disease control through genetic resistance could be an effective and relatively inexpensive approach to solving plant disease problems {Walker, 1927 #11185;Walker, 1930 #11186}.\n\nBernard Ogilvie Dodge (US) worked out the life cycle of the pink bread mold, Neorospora crassa, an ascomycete {Dodge, 1927 #5031}. Cornelius Lott Shear (US) and Bernard Ogilvie Dodge (US) named the fungal genus Neurospora {Shear, 1927 #1687}.\n\nEmil Bozler (DE-US) demonstrated that the nerve net of cnidarians is made up of separate cells connected by synaptic junctions. He also studied electrical aspects of muscle contraction and the role of calcium and magnesium in contraction and relaxation {Bozler, 1927 #12187}.\n\nNadine Dobrovolskaia-Zavadskaia (FR) and Nicolas Kobozieff (BE) identified t-haplotypes in mice because they contain the gene tct (t-complex tail interaction factor) that interacts with a spontaneous dominant mutation Brachyury (T). Brachyury produces short tails in T/+ mice but interacts with tct to produce a tailless phenotype in T/t mice {Dobrovolskaia-Zavadskaia, 1927 #16303;Dobrovolskaia-Zavadskaia, 1932 #16304}.\n\nJames R. Archer (GB), Steven J. Self (GB), and Bryan G. Winchester (GB) explained the t-complex in mice as a genetic entity which alters meiosis is such a way that its transmission into gametes is favored {Archer, 1978 #16302}. The t-complex is located on the proximal third of chromosome 17 in the house mouse. Naturally occurring variant forms of the t-complex, known as complete t-haplotypes, are found in wild mouse populations. The t-haplotypes contain at least four nonoverlapping inversions that suppress recombination with the wild-type chromosome, and lock into strong linkage disequilibrium.\n\nBarbara C. Turner (US) and David D. Perkins (US), working with Neurospora, discovered spore killer, a chromosomal factor that kills meiotic products in which it is not contained {Turner, 1979 #16300}.\n\nLarry Sandler (US) and Kent G. Golic (US) discovered segregation distorter (Sd), a meiotic drive system that operates in males of Drosophila melanogaster. Males heterozygous for Sd, a dominant neomorphic (gain-of-function) mutation on chromosome 2, can transmit their progeny in greater frequencies than expected on a Mendelian basis {Sandler, 1985 #16301}.\n\nEvgenii Nikanorovich Pavlovsky (RU) outlined his theory of landscape epidemiology and initiated modern concepts of parasite epidemiology {Pavlovsky, 1966 #6564}.\n\nJesse Amos (GB), Ronald George Hatton (GB), R.C. Knight (GB), and Arthur Morel Massee (GB) suggested that eriophyid mites (gall mites) could have some connection with plant virus transmission {Amos, 1927 #8693}.\n\nArthur M. Massee (GB) was the first to demonstrate this to be the case {Massee, 1952 #8694}.\n\nErwin Stresemann (DE) wrote an important volume on bird biology as part of Kükenthal and Krumbacks Handbuch der Zoologie. It contains thorough discussions of avian physiology, anatomy, and other phases of avian biology {Stresemann, 1927-1934 #5198}.\n\nTheophilus Shickel Painter (US) studied the Japanese Waltzer mouse and concluded that its phenotype results from a chromosomal deletion {Painter, 1927 #10776} This was the first cytological identification of a deletion producing a specific genetic effect and the first case in mammals of locating a definite gene on a definite chromosome.\n\nThomas Lewis (GB) originally described the wheal and flare reaction. He described how he believed histamine to be crucially involved in the central area of the weal, where it then stimulates an axon reflex or antidromic reflex, which transmits the signal to more distant parts, i.e., the flare {Lewis, 1927 #12192}.\n\nKarl Landsteiner (AT-US) and Philip Levine (RU-US) characterized the M, N, P and Jay blood antigens {Landsteiner, 1927a #14664;Landsteiner, 1927b #7095;Landsteiner, 1928 #1679;Landsteiner, 1931 #1622}.\n\nFlorence R. Sabin (US) and Charles A. Doan (US) showed that bovine tubercle bacilli were able to stimulate the maturation of monocytes and were destroyed by clasmatocytes (histiocytes of the connective tissues) {Sabin, 1927 #23054}.\n\nMatthew Walzer (US) and Sampson J. Wilson (US) demonstrated that the ingestion of foods would allow food antigens to penetrate the gastrointestinal barrier, which are then transported in the circulation to IgE-bearing mast cells in the skin {Walzer, 1927 #12226;Wilson, 1935 #12227}. The IgE class of immunoglobulin was not discovered until 1967.\n\nWillem Storm van Leeuwen (NL) and Hermann Dekker (DE) suggested the possible significance of mites in house dust allergy {Dekker, 1928 #21047;van Leeuwen, 1927 #21052;van Leeuwen, 1929 #21053}.\n\nReindert Voorhorst (NL), Frederik Theodorus Maria Spieksma (NL), Marise I.M. Spieksma-Boezeman (NL), Hendrik Varekamp (NL), Maarten J. Leupen (NL), and Ankie W. Lyklema (NL) reported that house dust contains mites of the genus Dermatophagoides and suggested that these were the major source of allergens in house dust {Spieksma, 1967a #21051;Spieksma, 1967b #21050;Voorhorst, 1964 #21048;Voorhorst, 1967 #21049}.\n\nDavid Marine (US) and Emil J. Baumann (US) found that administration of Ringers solution and isotonic solutions of sodium chloride and sodium acetate increased the life span of suprarenalectomized cats about three-fold {Marine, 1927 #16238}.\n\nSoma Weiss (HU-US) developed the first practical method of measuring circulation in time {Weiss, 1927 #13556}.\n\nWallace Osgood Fenn (US) was the first to measure the quantity of oxygen required by a nerve to conduct an impulse {Fenn, 1927 #10867}.\n\nOtto Heinrich Warburg (DE), Harry Goldblatt (US), Gladys Cameron (US), Fritz Kubowitz (DE), Karlfried Gawehn (DE), August-Wilhelm Geissler (DE), Detlev Kayser (DE) and Siegfried Lorenz (DE) provided the very unexpected and fundamental fact, that tissue culture is carcinogenic and that a too low oxygen pressure is the intrinsic cause. Anaerobiosis of cancer cells was an established fact by 1960 when methods were developed to measure the oxygen pressure inside of tumors in the living body {Goldblatt, 1953 #14829;Warburg, 1927b #14828;Warburg, 1956 #14825;Warburg, 1965 #14831;Warburg, 1966 #14830}.\n\nMark W. Woods (US), Katherine K. Sanford (US), Dean Burk (US), and Wilton R. Earle (US) found that cancer cells, descended in vitro from one single normal cell, were in vivo the more malignant, the higher their fermentation rate {Woods, 1959 #14826}.\n\nDean Burk (US), Mark W. Woods (US), and Jehu Hunter (US) found that when different carcinogens were used to induce in vivo hepatomas there was a direct correlation between malignancy and fermentation rate {Burk, 1967 #14827}.\n\nThomas Benton Cooley (US), E.R. Witwer (US), and O. Pearl Lee (US) described a disease, later known as Cooley erythroblastic anemia {Cooley, 1927 #11776}.\n\nGuido Fanconi (CH) reported a family in which three brothers had died in childhood from a condition, which resembled pernicious anemia. He observed that these children had slight stature, hypogonadism and skin pigmentation. In subsequent reports defects of the thumb and radius were recognized as additional but variable syndromic components {Fanconi, 1927 #19309}. This became known as Fanconis anemia.\n\nLeo Loeb (US) and Sewall Green Wright (US) demonstrated genetics of transplant specificity in mammals {Loeb, 1927 #14663}.\n\nAlbert Kuntz (US) described the gray ramus running from the second thoracic ganglion to the first thoracic nerve {Kuntz, 1927 #22781}.\n\nArthur Cecil Alport (ZA-GB) first published his description of a triad of symptoms in a family with hereditary familial congenital haemorrhagic nephritis, deafness and ocular changes (Alports syndrome) {Alport, 1927 #22884}.\n\nDavid F. Barker (US), Sirkka Liisa Hostikka (US), Jing Zhou (US), Louise T. Chow (US), Arnold R. Oliphant (US), Steven C. Gerken (US), Martin C. Gregory (US), Mark H. Skolnick (US), Curtis L. Atkin (US), and Karl Tryggvason (US) reported that X-linked Alport syndrome is caused by mutations of the COL4A5 gene coding for a collagen chain normally found in the mature glomerular basement membrane {Barker, 1990 #25634}.\n\nPhilip Edward Smith (US) perfected the surgical production of hypophysectomized rats and described the symptoms resulting as inhibition of growth in the young animal, weight loss, atrophy of the genital system with loss of libido sexualis, cessation of the female sex cycle, atrophy of the thyroid, parathyroids and suprarenal (adrenal) cortex, lowered resistance to injury, loss of appetite, weakness, and flabbiness. Smith found that he could reverse the atrophied functions in these animals only by injection of fresh hypophyseal tissue from adults. These animals have been widely used in studies of the endocrine system {Smith, 1927 #3379}.\n\nAlfred Washington Adson (US) and Jay R. Coffey (US) recommended the division of the scalenus anticus muscle for relief from symptoms of cervical rib syndrome {Adson, 1927 #22581;Adson, 1947 #22582;Adson, 1951 #22583}.\n\nManfred Joshua Sakel (PL-AT-US), in 1927, introduced hypoglycemic coma (insulin shock) produced by muscular injections of insulin as a treatment for psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) and drug addiction {Sakel, 1938 #12447;Sakel, 1994 #12449}. Note: In Berlin, between 1928 and 1931, Dr. Manfred Sakel used insulin to reduce the anxiety, nervousness, tremors, vomiting, weight loss, and agitation of patients undergoing opiate withdrawal. With insulin, they became calm, gained weight, and were much more cooperative. At times, when the dose of insulin was high, the patient went into stupor. After such events, the patients were less argumentative, less hostile, and less aggressive.\n\nLadislaus Joseph Meduna (HU) started seizure therapy by intravenous injection of cardiazol (in depressive states), a therapy that was abandoned in 1938 {Meduna, 1937 #12448;Meduna, 1938 #12453}.\n\nUgo Cerletti (IT) and Lucio Bini (IT) introduced electric convulsive therapy (E.C.T.) for severe mental states. This treatment was first used in schizophrenia, but severe depressive states very soon proved to be the main indication {Cerletti, 1938 #12452;Cerletti, 1940 #12450}. Note: people used electric eels and electric fish in ancient times to treat headaches and mental illness.\n\nJean Delay (FR) and Pierre Deniker (FR) demonstrated success with the first neurolepticcoined by Delay drug, the phenothiazine derivative chlorpromazine (Thorazine). Chlorpromazine has a remarkable effect on patients with schizophrenia, in particular highly agitated, anxious, and psychotic patients. It softens the effects of hallucinations and voices. Patients became quiet and much more manageable. It has effects on all types of patients {Delay, 1952a #12451}.\n\nOtto Wuth (US) described the preparation of a stable colloidal gold solution for use in the Lange protein spinal fluid test. With the bromide assay, Wuth found that 21% of 238 admissions to the psychiatric unit at Johns Hopkins in a six-month period had detectable levels of this drug in their serum.\n\nWuth described the therapeutic and toxic serum levels found in patients on bromide therapy for epilepsy. Based on clinical information he established 15 mmol/L (1 200 mg/L) as the upper limit of therapeutic and results over 19 mmol/L (1 500 mg/L) as toxic. He further recommended that patients on bromide therapy for the control of epilepsy be routinely monitored for serum levels. Wuth demonstrated with his case studies that the blood levels of bromide correlate with therapeutic efficacy and not with the dose administered {Wuth, 1927 #23457}. Note: This fundamental principal in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was advocated by Wuth almost 50 years before it became standard practice in clinical medicine.\n\nFritz Eichholtz (DE) and Otto Butzengeiger (DE) carried out the first experimental use of avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol) as an anesthetic in animals {Eichholtz, 1927 #17814}.\n\nOtto Butzengeiger (DE) introduced avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol) as a rectal anesthetic in the clinic {Butzengeiger, 1927 #14592}.\n\nMajor Greenwood (GB) and Janet Elizabeth Lane-Claypon (GB) developed a key type of epidemiological investigation, the so-called \"case-control study\". They tracked down 500 women with a history of breast cancer- the cases - and compared them with 500 women who were free of the disease but otherwise broadly similar, known as controls. The detailed survey that emerged constituted, as far as is known, the first published epidemiological questionnaire. This yielded results that enabled them to identify many of the risk factors for breast cancer that are still considered valid today. Their conclusions (or their data reworked by later researchers) agreed with those of modern reviewers: breast cancer was associated with age at menopause, artificial menopause, age at first pregnancy (age at marriage used as a proxy), number of children, and lactation.\n\nThey published what is now considered the first end results study. It followed a large sample of women with pathologically confirmed breast cancer for up to 10 years after their surgery. The study confirmed that women who were surgically treated at an early stage of the disease had a much better chance of surviving three, five, or 10 years longer than those operated on at any later stage. They showed that breast cancer risk increased for childless women, women who married later than average, and women who did not breast feed. The overall breast cancer risk decreased according to the number of children. For all cases, rapid treatment held the key to survival among women with breast cancer. In reviewing the family histories of their cases, they anticipated the role that genes might play in the development of breast cancer. There appear to be some families, they wrote, in which for reasons not certain at present, cancer plays havoc with the members, and there is (some) slight evidence in some instances that it attacks the same organs {Greenwood, 1927 #20221}.\n\nCharles Sutherland Elton (GB) redefined the species niche by emphasizing its functional role in the community: the niche is the status of an animal in its community. His concept idealized what the species does rather than where it livesthe functional niche concept {Elton, 1927 #8307}.\n\nErik Anderson Stensiö (SE) reconstructed a fossil Cephalaspis (an ostracoderm) and suggested its status as a vertebrate prototype replacing amphioxus {Stensiö, 1927 #14167}. Note: it is generally believed that living Agnatha (hagfishes and lampreys) and the ostracoderms are descended from a common ancestor.\n\nVladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev (RU), in 1927, diagnosed Joseph Stalin with grave paranoia. Later that day, Bekhterev suddenly died causing speculation that Stalin had his revenge for the diagnosis. After Bekhterevs death, Stalin had Bekhterevs name and all his works removed from textbooks.\n\nArthur Keith (GB) discovered a human upper jaw in Southern England and initially diagnosed it as Upper Paleolithic modern human {Keith, 1927 #20359}.\n\nThomas F.G. Higham (GB), Tim Compton (GB), Chris Stringer (GB), Roger Jacobi (GB), Beth Shapiro (US), Erik Trinkaus (US), Barry Chandler (GB), Flora Gröning (GB), Chris Collins (GB), Simon Hillison (UK), Paul O'Higgins (GB), Charles FitzGerald (UK), and Michael Fagan (UK) tested the jaw Keith found using a Bayesian analysis of new ultra-filtered bone collagen. It was dated in an ordered stratigraphic sequence at the site to 44.241.5 K BP. This makes it older than any other equivalently dated modern human specimen and directly contemporary with the latest European Neanderthals {Higham, 2011 #20360}.\n\nArturo Palma di Cesnola (IT) and Borzatti von Löwenstern (IT), in 1964, found two deciduous molars in the so-called Uluzzian archaeological layers unearthed from the Grotta del Cavallo (Southern Italy). Classified as Neanderthal and dated to 45,000 years ago these fossils are the oldest known human remains on the continent {di Cesnola, 1964 #22452}.\n\nStefano Benazzi (AT), Katerina Douka (GB), Cinzia Fornai (AT), Catherine C. Bauer (DE), Ottmar Kullmer (DE), Jiří Svoboda (CZ), Ildikó Pap (HU), Francesco Mallegni (IT), Priscilla Bayle (FR), Michael Coquerelle (ES), Silvana Condemi (FR), Annamaria Ronchitelli (IT), Katerina Harvati (DE) and Gerhard W. Weber (AT) reanalyzed the deciduous molars from the Grotta del Cavallo (Southern Italy), associated with the Uluzzian and originally classified as Neanderthal. Their new chronometric data for the Uluzzian layers of Grotta del Cavallo obtained from associated shell beads and included within a Bayesian age model show that the teeth must date to ~4543 K BP. The Cavallo human remains are therefore the oldest known European anatomically modern humans, confirming a rapid dispersal of modern humans across the continent before the Aurignacian and the disappearance of Neanderthals {Benazzi, 2011 #20361}.\n\n1928\n\nError is modern while truth is ancient. Ramón y Cajal {Ramón y Cajal, 1928 #5587}.\n\n\"Only when some important function... lends itself to ready observation or quantitative measurement are the conditions suitable for making progress...\" Edwin B. Hart, et al., {Hart, 1928 #3064}.\n\nAs I view my contribution to the writing of our time, it seems to me to consist of a double affirmative, saying first that an awareness and experience of Nature is necessary to Man if he is to have his humanity, and saying in the second place that that same awareness must have something of a religious quality, the Italian pieta, if you will.\n\nNature is a part of our humanity, and without some awareness and experience of that divine mystery man ceases to be man. When the Pleiades and the wind in the grass are no longer a part of the human spirit, a part of the very flesh and bone, man becomes, as it were, a kind of cosmic outlaw, having neither the completeness and the integrity of the animal nor the birthright of a true humanity. Henry Beston {Beston, 1928 #10805}.\n\nAdolf Otto Rheinhold Windaus (DE) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for research into the constitution of the sterols and their connection with the vitamins.\n\nCharles Jules Henri Nicolle (FR) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on typhus.\n\nKurt Heinrich Meyer (DE) and Herman Francis Mark (DE) proved the existence of polymeric chain molecules by examining the crystalline structure of polymers with x-rays {Mark, 1928a #12198;Mark, 1928b #12199;Mark, 1928c #12200}.\n\nOtto Fritz Meyerhof (DE-US) and Karl Lohmann (DE) isolated argininephosphoric acid from arthropod (crustacean) muscle. It was found to be the invertebrate analogue of the vertebrate phosphagen (creatine phosphate) {Meyerhof, 1928a #8625;Meyerhof, 1928b #8626;Meyerhof, 1928c #8627}.\n\nKarl Lohmann (DE) and Hermann Lehmann (DE-GB) demonstrated that phosphagen (creatine phosphate) reacts with ADP in minced crustacean muscle {Lohmann, 1935a #8628;Lehmann, 1936 #8629}. This provided, for the first time, a mechanism for utilization of phosphate energy. This became known as the Lohmann reaction.\n\nMarjory Stephenson (GB) obtained the first cell-free preparation of non-NAD dependent lactic dehydrogenase, which oxidized lactate to pyruvate in the presence of methylene blue {Stephenson, 1928 #19715}.\n\nBengt Andersson (SE) provided evidence for identifying the coenzyme necessary for reducing pyruvate with NAD {Andersson, 1933 #19713;Andersson, 1934 #19714}.\n\nOliver Kamm (US), Thomas B. Aldrich (US), Irvine W. Grote (US), Louis W. Rowe (US), Edwin P. Bugbee (US) started the isolation and purification of vasopressin and oxytocin from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland {Kamm, 1928 #5453}. Note: Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in the supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and transported within axons to the posterior lobe of the pituitary for storage. The gene encoding AVP is arginine vasopressinneurophysin II (AVPNPII), located on chromosome 20p13.\n\nGeorge William Marshall Findley (GB) demonstrated the association of skin cancer with exposure to ultraviolet light {Findlay, 1928 #23764}.\n\nLeslie Julius Harris (GB) and Thomas Moore (GB) confirmed the toxic action of irradiated ergosterol in excess and concluded that \"a weight of evidence pointed to the toxic action of excess of vitamin D {Harris, 1928 #23387}.\n\nDonald Dexter van Slyke (US) and James A.

Gottwalt Fischer (DE) and Kurt Löwenberg (DE) synthesized phytol from pseudoionone {Fischer, 1929 #12255}.\n\nJames Waddell (US), Conrad Arnold Elvehjem (US), Harry Steenbock (US), Edwin Bret Hart (US), Evelyn Van Donk (US), and Blanche M. Riising (US) discovered that inorganic iron salts are ineffective at increasing the hemoglobin levels of anemic rats, but that ashed residues from dried beef liver, dried lettuce, and yellow corn were very effective in curing anemia. From these results they inferred that the extracts contained some other inorganic substance that was necessary to produce hemoglobin. They later discovered that this necessary substance is copper {Waddell, 1928 #21464}.\n\nJames Waddell (US), Harry Steenbock (US), Conrad Arnold Elvehjem (US), Edwin Bret Hart (US), and Evelyn Van Donk (US) found that copper-containing liver extracts and a copper sulfate solution both served equally well in curing anemia in rats. This led them to the conclusion that, the deficiency (in this anemia) is inorganic in nature and that this inorganic deficiency is copper only {Waddell, 1929 #21465}.\n\nHubert Bradford Vickery (CA-US) and Charles S. Leavenworth (US) carried out an analysis of the basic amino acids in horse hemoglobin and concluded that the protein contains 7.64% histidine, 3.32% arginine, and 8.10% lysine. These results agreed with the assumption that hemoglobin has 33 molecules of histidine, 13 molecules of arginine, and 37 molecules of lysine {Vickery, 1928 #21450}.\n\nBertil Hanstöm (SE) discovered that the X-organ, located in the eyestalk of crustaceans, secretes neurohormones {Hanström, 1928 #15543;Hanström, 1931 #19447;Hanström, 1933 #19446}. Neurosecretory cells in the X-organ (part of the brain) produce a molt-inhibiting hormone that is stored in the sinus gland of the eyestalk, while a molting hormone is produced in the Y-organ. Interactions of these two hormones control the molting process.\n\nBernhard Zondek (DE-IL) and Selmar Aschheim (DE) isolated from the anterior pituitary gland a gonadotropic hormone they named prolan (it was luteinizing hormone-LH-and/or follicle stimulating hormone-FSH) {Zondek, 1928 #14593}. Prolan is a term no longer in use.\n\nFritz Albert Lipmann (DE-US), Vladimir Aleksandrovich Engelhardt (RU), and A.P. Barkash (RU) presented evidence for the metabolic pathway from glucose-6-phosphate to triose phosphate by way of ribose-5-phosphate. They called it the hexose monophosphate shunt {Lipmann, 1928 #8346;Engelhardt, 1938 #9269}.\n\nHans Sachs (DE) and Ernst Witebsky (DE-US) developed a precipitation reaction for serological diagnostics of syphilis {Sachs, 1928 #13576}.\n\nFrederick Griffith (GB) discovered the transforming factor while working with Diplococcus pneumoniae (Streptococcus pneumoniae). He demonstrated that this factor, which he isolated from smooth colonies, is a chemical that is present in the extract of dead smooth colonies but missing from live rough colonies. When mixed with living rough colonies the transforming factor converted many of them to living smooth colonies {Griffith, 1928 #621}.\n\nJames Lionel Alloway (US), working in the laboratory of Oswald Theodore Avery (CA-US), broke open cells of the smooth form of Pneumococcus and collected the cell contents, which were passed through a filter that would remove all wall material. When this extract was added to a culture of growing rough cells some of them were transformed into smooth cells. When the transforming extract was treated with alcohol a thick syrupy precipitate formed {Alloway, 1932 #708}.\n\nOswald Theodore Avery (CA-US) would later show that the transforming factor is DNA. See, Sanfelice, 1893 and Avery, 1944.\n\nAndrew C. Ivy (US) and Eric Oldberg (US) discovered and named the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) which controls gall bladder function {Ivy, 1928 #3164}.\n\nViktor Mutt (EE) and J. Erik Jorpes (SE) determined the structure of cholecystokinin (CCK) {Mutt, 1968 #12233}.\n\nJulian Walawski (PL) and Jerzy Kaulbersz (PL) discovered enterogastrons produced in the large intestine, which inhibit the stomach secretion {Walawski, 1928a #17345;Walawski, 1928b #17346}.\n\nAlbert Imre Szent-Györgyi (HU-US) using the adrenal cortex, cabbage, and orange as raw material isolated and crystallized a factor which he knew was in some way involved in the mechanism of biological oxidation. He named this acidic carbohydrate hexuronic acid {Szent-Györgyi, 1928 #2524}.\n\nCharles Glen King (US) and William A. Waugh (US) succeeded in obtaining Szent-Györgyis hexuronic acid in crystalline form then equated it with vitamin C {King, 1932 #2975;Waugh, 1932 #2976}. Today it is known as ascorbic acid (ascorbic meaning, no scurvy) or vitamin C.\n\nSzent-Györgyi (HU-US) and Walter Norman Haworth (GB) suggested that vitamin C be renamed ascorbic acid {Szent-Györgyi, 1933 #2971}.\n\nWalter Norman Haworth (GB), Luszló Vargha (HU), Ernest G. Cox (GB), Edmund Langley Hirst (GB), and Reginald John William Reynolds (GB) would contribute to the determination of its chemical structure {Haworth, 1933 #2977;Vargha, 1932 #2978;Cox, 1932 #2979}.\n\nWalter Norman Haworth (GB) and Edmund Langley Hirst (GB) synthesized ascorbic acid {Haworth, 1933 #2977}.\n\nCornelis Bernardus Kees van Niel (NL-US), working with propionic acid bacteria, provided the first quantitative picture of the products derived by these bacteria from lactate, glycerol, glucose, and starch. His taxonomic treatment determined the veracity of the genus Propionibacterium. During these studies he identified diacetyl as the compound responsible for the characteristic aroma of high quality butter {van Niel, 1928 #10778}.\n\nPierre Stricker (FR) and Fritz Grüeter (FR) induced mammary gland development and the secretion of milk by injecting anterior pituitary extract into castrated virgin rabbits {Stricker, 1928 #12241;Stricker, 1929 #19792}. This strongly suggested the presence of a lactation hormone (prolactin).\n\nHerbert McLean Evans (US) and Miriam E. Simpson (US) found that extracts from the anterior pituitary cause hypertrophy of the mammary glands in virgin rats {Evans, 1929 #10429}.\n\nOscar Riddle (US) and Pela Fay Braucher (US) showed that extracts of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland could cause the enlargement and functioning of the crop-glands in pigeons {Riddle, 1931 #12242}.\n\nOscar Riddle (US), Robert Wesley Bates (US), and Simon William Dykshorn (US) reported their discovery of a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland, which stimulates the crop-gland in pigeons and is lactogenic in guinea pigs; they named it prolactin {Riddle, 1932 #4845;Riddle, 1933 #3382}.\n\nAbraham White (US), Hubert Ralph Catchpole (GB-US), and Cyril Norman Hugh Long (GB-US) crystallized the lactogenic hormone prolactin {White, 1937 #6709}.\n\nChoh Hao Li (CN-US), Jonathan S. Dixon (US), Tung-bin Lo (TW), Knud D. Schmidt (DK), and Yuri A. Pankov (RU) determined the primary amino acid sequence of the sheep lactogenic hormone prolactin {Li, 1969b #15410;Li, 1970b #10176}.\n\nHenry George Friesen (CA), Harvey J. Guyda (CA), and Jules Hardy (CA) discovered prolactin in humans {Friesen, 1965 #9823;Friesen, 1970 #9824}.\n\nG. Michael Besser (US), Lynne Parke (GB), Christopher R.W. Edwards (GB), Isabel A. Forsyth (GB), and Alan S. McNeilly (US) found that they could successfully treat galactorrhoea by reducing plasma prolactin levels using brom-ergocryptine {Besser, 1972 #9351}.\n\nEva Nagy (HU-CA) and Istvan Berczi (HU-CA) reported that regulation of the immune response by the neuroendocrine hormone prolactin (PRL) occurs via its interaction with the prolactin receptor. Interference with this ligand-receptor interaction inhibits both in vitro and in vivo immune responses {Nagy, 1978 #14597}.\n\nCharles V. Clevenger (US), Amy L. Sillman (US), Michael B. Prystowsky (US), Yi-Ping Rao (US), Donna J. Buckley (US), Mark D. Olson (US) and Arthur R. Buckley (US) showed that prolactin is able to physically enter the cell, travel straight to the cells DNA, and directly activate the process that turns on genes and triggers the growth of breast cancer cells. It does this by binding to a protein called cyclophilin B, or CYPB for short {Clevenger, 1990 #14599;Rao, 1995 #14600}.\n\nCharles V. Clevenger (US), Tracey L. Plank (US), Susan E. Hankinson (US), Walter C. Willett (US), Dominique S. Michaud (US), JoAnn E. Manson (US), Graham A. Colditz (US), Christopher Langcope (US), Bernard Rosner (US), Frank E. Speizer (US), Marcela V. Maus (US), and Sean C. Reilly (US) presented evidence that the somatolactogenic hormone prolactin, a naturally occurring peptide hormone needed for milk production following pregnancy, stimulates the movement, or motility of breast cancer cells causing the cells to essentially pick up and move, and actually trigger invasive potential of these cells {Clevenger, 1997 #14596;Hankinson, 1999 #14595;Maus, 1999 #14594}.\n\nGeorg von Békésy (HU-US) elucidated all the physical events at every strategically important point in the transmission system of the ear by recording events in this fragile biological miniature system, micro dissection, advanced teletechniques for stimulation and recording, and high magnification stroboscopic microscopy. He elucidated the vibration patterns of the eardrum and the interplay of the ossicle movements, provided experimental and clinical data confirming Helmholtzs assumption that the frequency of the sound waves determines the location along the basilar membrane at which stimulation occurs. He found that movements of the stirrup footplate evokes a wave complex in the basilar membrane, which travels from the stiffer basal part to the more flexible part in the apex of the cochlea. The crest of the largest wave first increases, thereafter quickly decreases. The position of the maximal amplitude was found to be dependent on the frequency of the stimulating sound waves in such a way that the highest crest of the travelling wave appears near the apex of the cochlea at low-frequency tones and near its base at high frequencies {von Békésy, 1928 #14150;von Békésy, 1930 #17668;von Békésy, 1960 #9178;von Békésy, 1967 #6599;von Helmholtz, 1863 #12831}.\n\nDonald Dexter van Slyke (US) and Julius Sendroy, Jr. (US) reported studies of gas and electrolyte equilibria in blood in which they present line charts for graphic calculations by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and for calculating plasma carbon dioxide content from whole blood content {van Slyke, 1928a #9326}. Van Slyke continued to improve this method through eleven more papers.\n\nThomas Hunt Morgan (US) presented the theory of the gene when he said, The theory states that the characters of the individual are referable to paired elements (genes) in the germinal material that are held together in a definite number of linkage groups; it states that the members of each pair of genes separate when the germ-cells mature in accordance with Johann Gregor Mendels first law, and in consequence each germ-cell comes to contain one set only; it states that the members belonging to different linkage groups assort independently in accordance with Johann Gregor Mendels second law; it states that an orderly interchangecrossing over also takes place, at times, between elements in corresponding linkage groups; and it states that the frequency of crossing over furnishes evidence of the linear order of the elements in each linkage group and of the relative position of the elements with respect to each other {Morgan, 1928 #2473}.\n\nHermann Joseph Muller, Jr. (US) and Theophilus Shickel Painter (US), using Drosophila, carried out parallel investigations in which phenotypic variations brought about by x-rays were related to physical changes in the chromosomes, e.g., deletions and translocations {Muller, 1928 #12182;Painter, 1929 #10777}.\n\nJohann Heinrich Emil Heitz (DE) coined the terms euchromatin and heterochromatin {Heitz, 1928 #12384}.\n\nKarl Heinrich Bauer (DE) proposed the theory that cancers arise because of mutations {Bauer, 1928 #23771}. Ernest Edward Tyzzer (US) coined the phrase somatic mutation {Tyzzer, 1916 #23772}.\n\nEggert Hugo Heiberg Møller (US), John F. McIntosh (US), and Donald Dexter van Slyke (US) determined that a constant volume of blood is being cleared of urea in each minutes time course. This came to be referred to as standard blood urea clearances {Møller, 1928 #3366}.\n\nAdrian Stokes (GB), Johannes H. Bauer (US), N. Paul Hudson (US), Constant Mathis (FR), Andrew Watson Sellards (US), and Jean Laigret (FR), working in West Africa, proved that yellow fever is caused by a virus and transferable to monkeys {Mathis, 1928 #6977;Stokes, 1928a #6978;Stokes, 1928b #9120}. Note: Stokes died of a yellow fever infection.\n\nRenjiro Kaneko (JP) and Yoshio Aoki (JP) determined that the etiological agent of Japanese B encephalitis was probably a virus {Kaneko, 1928 #6974}.\n\nMichitomo Hayashi (JP) transmitted Japanese encephalitis one of the leading causes of acute encephalopathy from an infected human to monkeys by way of an intracerebral injection to prove the viral etiology of the disease {Hayashi, 1934 #15528}.\n\nItsuma Takaki (JP), Tenji Taniguchi (JP), M. Hosokawa (JP), and S. Kuga (JP) isolated the viral etiological agent of Japanese B encephalitis {Takaki, 1926 #6975;Taniguchi, 1936 #6976}.\n\nStefan Nicolau (GB) and Ian Galloway (GB) discovered the virus of Borna disease and enzootic encephalo-myelitis of sheep and cattle {Nicolau, 1928 #25960}. Note: the only bornavirus\n\nJean-Louis Verge (FR) and N. Christoforoni (FR) were the first to associate a virus with feline panleukopenia {Verge, 1928 #25961}. Note: the first parvovirus\n\nThomas Milton Rivers (US) edited the first major virology book, Filterable Viruses. Harold L. Amoss, Jacques J.

Burdon (US) described Bacteroides melaninogenicus in the stools of patients suffering from chronic amebic dysentery, and in puerperal sepsis. This bacterium is often associated with the mouth, tonsils, infected abdominal wounds, and focal infections of the kidneys {Burdon, 1928 #2247}.\n\nHenry E. Meleney (US) presented clear evidence of the development of six immunologically distinct strains of Borrelia recurrentis {Meleney, 1928 #106}.\n\nKarl Johannes (Hans) Kniep (DE) and Arthur Henry Reginald Buller (CA) had previously presented the broad picture of the genetic control system and the developmental sequence from spore to spore in the basidiomycetes {Kniep, 1928 #10011;Buller, 1909 #10010}. Buller was also a poet. One of his most recognized works is this limerick, first published in the Dec. 19, 1923 issue of Punch:\n\nThere was a young lady named Bright\n\nWhose speed was far faster than light;\n\nShe set out one day,\n\nIn a relative way\n\nAnd returned on the previous night.\n\nÉmile Eugène Aldric Topsen"
