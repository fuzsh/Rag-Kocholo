        "text": "Alchemy, an ancient branch of natural philosophy, studied substance properties and reactions since the 1st/2nd century. It was a proto-scientific tradition in China, India, the Muslim world, and Europe. Modern chemistry and pharmacology replaced it during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n1600\n\nDuring the Renaissance and 17th century, the scientific method—emphasizing the importance of observation and experimentation in gaining knowledge about the world—was developed and refined, leading to the foundation of modern chemistry and other scientific disciplines. Discoveries of gases, improvements in alchemy, advancements in metal production, and developments in chemistry’s role in medicine were also made during this period.\n\n1604 – 1670 Johann Rudolph Glauber\n\nDiscovered sodium sulfate, also known as Glauber’s salt 1623 – 1662 Blaise Pascal\n\nMade important contributions to probability theory and the understanding of the equilibrium of fluids 1627 – 1691 Robert Boyle\n\nDiscovered Boyle’s law, which describes the relationship between pressure and volume of a gas 1673 – 1734 Johann Konrad Dippel\n\nAlchemist, who was well-known for selling his animal oil as “Elixir vitae” and co-developed a process for the production of Prussian blue\n\n1700\n\nIn the 18th century, new gases such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen were discovered, and the phlogiston theory was widely accepted but later proven incorrect. New elements were discovered, and Antoine Lavoisier introduced a new system of chemical nomenclature. Additionally, chemical instrumentation such as the balance, calorimeter, and spectroscope were developed for analysis and measurement.\n\n1716 – 1795 Antonio de Ulloa\n\nIs credited with the first scientific description of platinum 1722 – 1765 Axel Fredrik Cronstedt\n\nSwedish researcher discovered nickel and is considered a founder of modern mineralogy 1743 – 1794 Antoine Lavoisier\n\nDisproved the phlogiston theory and he is often considered the father of modern chemistry 1748 – 1822 Claude Louis Berthollet\n\nFrench chemist well-known for work on modern nomenclature in chemistry, equilibria, dyes, and bleaches 1760 – 1852 Johan Gadolin\n\nDiscovered the first rare-earth compounds 1763 – 1829 Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin\n\nDiscovered chromium and beryllium 1766 – 1844 John Dalton\n\nIntroduced modern atomic theory 1767 – 1845 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure\n\nOne of the major pioneers in the study of photosynthesis 1767 – 1813 Anders Gustav Ekeberg\n\nDiscovered the transition metal tantalum 1786 – 1889 Michel Eugène Chevreul\n\nStudied fatty acids and improved soap and candle production 1792 – 1841 Johan August Arfwedson\n\nDiscovered lithium 1799 – 1868 Christian Friedrich Schönbein\n\nDiscovered ozone and guncotton\n\n1800\n\nIn the 19th century, John Dalton proposed his atomic theory, which laid the foundation for understanding atoms and chemical reactions. Organic chemistry was born, with Friedrich Wöhler’s synthesis of urea challenging the theory of vitalism. Dmitri Mendeleev’s periodic table organized elements by their properties, while electrochemistry made progress with the discovery of electrolysis and batteries.
