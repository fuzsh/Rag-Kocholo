        "text": "Dugongs are primarily herbivorous, grazing on up to 30kg of seagrass a day. They eat both day and night, locating their food with the help of coarse, sensitive bristles on their upper lip.\n\nThese large creatures are found in warm water around coastlines, both north and south of the equator. They inhabit both freshwater and brackish water, where seagrass beds can be found. Australia hosts the largest number of Dugongs, with the Reef providing an important feeding ground.\n\nThough they do travel long distances, Dugongs are not a migratory species. They are solitary creatures, though can be found in pairs. Despite their solitary nature, Dugongs constantly communicate with one another through a series of echoing chirps, whistles, and barks.\n\nFemale Dugongs can give birth to one calf per pregnancy and birth every 3 to 7 years over their 70-year lifespan. Young Dugongs stay with their mothers for the first few months of life. Baby dugongs are also famously cute!\n\nSince Dugong populations increase slowly, at greatest by 5% annually, their population is vulnerable. Changes in water quality and coastal development can lead to habitat degradation, ruining vital seabeds. Fishing practices, such as commercial netting, can also lead to accidental drownings. These stresses can cause female Dugongs to produce fewer offspring, lowering the population growth further."
