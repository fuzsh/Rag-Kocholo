        "text": "Did you know? There are more than 6400 species of flora and fauna living under the sea in the Bay of Bengal. Andaman and Nicobar Island, their habitat and home, attract tourists from all over the world to experience the spectacular marine biodiversity.\n\nBut among all the animals the dugong sea cow is the state animal of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and is also known as the ‘lady of the sea’.\n\nIn this blog, we will discuss in detail this exotic marine organism and its stunning features.\n\nHabitat and Distribution\n\nThroughout the warmer latitudes of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, dugongs are found in plenty. This endangered species of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, are found in certain creeks.\n\nHere are the details of their natural habitat in the archipelago.\n\nRitchie’s Archipelago\n\nRitchie's archipelago in South Andaman forms one of the critical dugong habitats in the islands. Situated 20 KM east of the mainland or Great Andaman, Ritchie’s Archipelago is a cluster of small islands.\n\nDugongs have been sighted on Inglis Island, Henry Lawrence Island, John Lawrence Island, and Outram Island among many others.\n\nNorth and Middle Andaman\n\nAccording to a report by G.C. Rao in the 1990s, Dugong colonization was found in Baratang Beach, Long Island, Parkinson Island, and Purlob Island.\n\nRecent reports claim otherwise. A recent study by C. Raghunathan, K. Venkataraman, and P. T. Rajan suggests that the dugong population has hit a steep downfall and can be found in only a few places in lesser numbers.\n\nSome of them are- Ross Island, Smith Island, Lamia Bay, Ariel Bay, and North Reef Island.\n\nSouth Andaman\n\nIn South Andaman, the dugong population is very scattered and hard to locate, though there have been occasional sightings by tourists or local fishermen.\n\nOne adult dugong about 3m long was observed at a depth of 5m in the seagrass bed of Kodiaghat near Chidyatapu.\n\nLittle Andaman\n\nIn little Andaman, Dugong Creek is a popular tourist spot to observe dugongs. They still live in that area and if lucky, you can see them jumping out of the water surface at times.\n\nFrom Port Blair, you can book a ferry and reach the Dugong Creek Village within 6 hours.\n\nFeatures and Characteristics of Dugongs\n\nDugongs belong to the Dugongidae family. They are also the only species left of this family.\n\nThey have a lifespan of 70 years but their survival is in danger due to the increasing risk of poaching and habitat destruction. Here are 7 primary features of the dugong fish\n\nSize\n\nDugongs are very heavy and have a large body. They can reach body lengths of more than 13 feet (4 m). They weigh more than one metric tonne.\n\nFood\n\nDugongs are herbivorous mammals. Dugongs are also known as sea cows because their diet consists mainly of seabed grasses.\n\nThey consume the whole plant while eating, including the roots.\n\nThey are primarily calm and passive animals, living deep inside the sea, upon the sea bed due to their food preferences.\n\nThey are the only herbivorous mammals in the sea with the characteristics of that of a cow.\n\nThawte\n\nDugongs, also the state animal of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, are known as sea-pigs or pani-suwar (thawtee).\n\nDue to the heavy structure of their body, their huge size, and their eating habits they have been named as that by the locales.\n\nBack Defense\n\nMost of the blubber or fat is settled on the back of the dugong’s body and they use it as their defense mechanism.\n\nThey aren't fierce or aggressive animals. They do not strike small fishes or other smaller organisms.\n\nThey respond timidly only when chased or attacked. Dugongs escape their predators by showing their back which can’t be targeted easily. They also move swiftly across the water.\n\nBrain\n\nDugongs have very wee-sized brains. They do not develop much internally, either. This happens because they do not have to engage in hunts and are very peace-loving creatures.\n\nThat is also why they are endangered species, as dugongs can be hunted very easily.\n\nThey also occasionally crash with boats or ferries which causes a decrease in the already depreciating number.\n\nLekking\n\nMale dugongs can be seen impressing their female counterparts during appropriate seasons (there is no fixed season, they do it as they please!).\n\nThis process of impressing the other dugongs is called lekking. Eight years to eighteen years is the age in which they develop a sexual urge and become ready to reproduce.\n\nA protrusion of tusks is visible in the male dugong due to an increasing level of testosterone.\n\nReproduction\n\nDugongs reproduce via internal fertilization and give birth to large young, which they nurse for as long as a year and a half.\n\nAdult dugongs do not have any natural predators, but juveniles may be eaten by saltwater crocodiles, killer whales, and large, coastal sharks.\n\nWith the help of internal fertilization, dugongs produce a large young one. They are then nursed by the mother for a year and a half.\n\nThey run the risk of being attacked by whales, crocodiles, and coastal sharks. So, they need protection until they grow into large size and develop their defence mechanism.\n\nReasons for Endangerment\n\nHere are 3 main reasons why dugongs are moving toward extinction at a fast pace-\n\nFood\n\nDugongs have been hunted by humans for more than 30 years now. Dugong meat is believed to be a great source of protein and has been categorized as an aphrodisiac food (food that enhances your sexual health).\n\nOil\n\nThe oil that is made from the body fat of dugong is believed to be a great source of nutrients. This is causing illegal poaching activities even today as the number of dugongs decreases steadily not only in India but all over the world.\n\nDestruction of Natural Habitat\n\nLoss of seagrass habitat or its degradation due to the water pollution caused by the development of industrial areas near the coast are the main reasons for the decreasing number of dugongs.\n\nIf there is not enough sea grass to eat then the dugong does not breed normally.\n\nThey need enough grass to survive and breed naturally. We must make efforts to conserve the seagrass habitat.\n\nThey also often become victims of bycatch, the accidental entanglement in fishing nets.\n\nConclusion\n\nDugongs, the sea cows of Andaman, and the state animal of Andaman and Nicobar Islands remain one of the most popular attractions for tourists.\n\nMost Andaman tour packages consist of a trip to Dugong Creek.\n\nThe Indian government has taken certain measures to conserve the natural habitat of the dugongs and we as responsible citizens of the country should also try and make an effort to conserve their home.\n\nFAQs\n\n1. When was the dugong sea cow first discovered?\n\nIt was first classified by Müller in 1776 as Trichechus dugon, a member of the manatee genus previously defined by Linnaeus.\n\n2. When was the dugong sea cow considered endangered?\n\nDugongs are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and have been considered so since 1982. They are being endangered by persistent loss of seagrass habitat and pollution of coastal areas.\n\n3. What are the other endangered species of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands?\n\nAn overall number of 46 different terrestrial mammal organisms have been discovered in the archipelago. 3 critically endangered species among them are the Andaman shrew, Jenkin's shrew, and Nicobar shrew.\n\n4. Which country has the largest population of dugong fish?\n\nIn the whole world, Australia has the largest number of dugongs living in natural habitats. Shark Bay, Western Australia is home to over 10,000 dugongs."
