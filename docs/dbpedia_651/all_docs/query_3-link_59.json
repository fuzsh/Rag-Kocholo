        "text": "Dugongs have a distinctive body shape, with a large, broad, rounded body and a relatively small head. They have a paddle-like tail and flippers for forelimbs, and their skin is thick and wrinkled, typically gray or brown in color.\n\nThey have a small amount of hair on their body, but it is not visible due to the thickness of their skin. Their upper lip is split into two, which they use to dig up seagrass to eat. They have small, peg-like teeth that are continually replaced throughout their lifetime.\n\nThey are large animals, fully grown dugongs typically range from 2.5 – 3.4 meters (8.2 – 11.15 ft) in length and weight around 250 – 400 kg (551 – 882 lbs)\n\nDugongs are typically solitary animals, they can also be found in small groups. They are slow-moving and spend most of their time grazing on seagrass.\n\nThey can remain underwater for up to six minutes, but typically resurface for air every 3-5 minutes. They are known to be curious and will often approach boats and divers in the wild.\n\nThere is only one extant species of dugong, known as Dugong dugon, belonging to the family Dugongidae, which contains just one other species, the Steller’s sea cow which is extinct.\n\nThe dugong is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to loss of habitat and hunting."
