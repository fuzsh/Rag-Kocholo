        "meta_description": "The dugong (/ˈdjuːɡɒŋ/; Dugong dugon) is a medium-sized marine mammal. It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes three species of manatees. It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern relative, Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century. The dugong is the only strictly herbivorous marine mammal. (Source: Wikipedia, 'Dugong', https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugong, CC BY-SA 3.0 . Photo: (c) Luis P.
