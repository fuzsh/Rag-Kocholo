        "text": "Description Body streamlined with a blunt, whiskered head and a thick layer of blubber. Body colour is usually greyisy-brown. Length ranges from 2.2m to 3.4m. Ecological Notes In coastal seas, usually at the mouth of rivers. This exclusively aquatic mammal travels alone, in pairs, or in small groups, and feeds on seagrass. Apparently, it feeds during the night and rests in deeper water during the day. Distribution In Singapore, dugongs are recorded mainly from the north-eastern Johor Straits, around the Sungai Johor estuary. Strandings have occurred on Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong, Changi, and the beaches along the East Coast Parkway. Individuals have been sighted off the Changi coast, around Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong, and off Labrador Beach. The dugong is widely distributed throughout tropical Indo-West Pacific. Trends & Threats Dugongs in Singapore waters have been injured by propellers of motor boats and entangled (and drowned) in fishing nets. Extensive land reclamation destroys beds of sea grasses that are their main diet."
