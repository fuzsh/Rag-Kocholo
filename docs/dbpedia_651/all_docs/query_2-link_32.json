        "text": "There is one school of thought that says sailors and fishermen might have seen the dugong’s human-like, smiling faces rise above the water to breathe from afar, their heads turning, and their notched tails as they dived back in. They could have thought they were the magical sea nymphs they heard about in stories. In fact, the word ‘dugong’ is derived from the Malay for ‘lady of the sea’.\n\nDugongs are marine mammals under the order Sirenia – and do you know that Sirenia comes from the Greek word for mermaid: seirēn? In some other languages, siren or variants of it (e.g., sirena, sirène, sereia) translate to mermaid.\n\nIsn’t that fascinating? Let’s not stop here but learn more about these gentle giants of the sea. What is a dugong? Is a dugong a whale, or are dugongs just manatees? They can look like they’re smiling, but are dugongs friendly? Join us in our journey of discovery, and learn the answers to these questions and more.\n\nDugongs are marine animals, and they live only in saltwater. You’ll find them in protected and sheltered coastal bays, mangrove channels, and inshore islands.\n\nDugongs thrive in shallow waters. While they may dive into deeper waters (waters as deep as 39 meters), they spend most of their time in waters 10 meters deep.\n\nThe Arabian Gulf – particularly around the United Arab Emirates – is home to one of the largest concentrations of dugongs in the world - the second largest in fact. The largest population is in the northern coast of Australia, between Shark Bay and Moreton Bay.\n\nThe rest of the world’s dugongs are scattered around 140,000 km of coastline spanning at least 48 countries north and south of the equator. Their habitats include the Coral Triangle and the coast of East Africa. The Coral Triangle is in the Western Pacific, defined by the marine waters of Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste, Solomon Islands, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The coast of East Africa is a 4600-kilometer stretch from Somalia in the north to South Africa in the south.\n\nThe dugong is not considered to be under threat in the UAE and Australia, thanks to the dugong-protective stances of both countries’ governments. That said, the species remains vulnerable and requires active protection, especially since the dugong population continues to decline in the urban coast of Queensland.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species says the dugong is vulnerable to extinction. The dugong has been declared functionally extinct in China and can no longer be found in Taiwan, Mauritius, and the Maldives. It has also disappeared from the Sakishima Shoto Islands of Japan, Western Sri Lanka, the Pearl River estuary in Hong Kong, some parts of Cambodia and Vietnam, and multiple islands in the Philippines.\n\nWhat eats dugongs? Fully grown dugongs do not have many true natural predators. Larger aquatic animals (e.g., killer whales, sharks, saltwater crocodiles) are mainly a threat to smaller and younger dugongs, but they have been known to prey on adults as well.\n\nHowever, they are vulnerable to extinction because of us humans. Human activities lead to chemical run-offs from industrial and agricultural activities, coastal infrastructure development, and dredging. These damage seagrass habitats and reduce water clarity. As seagrass cover dwindles, so does the dugong population. Human activities also lead to pollution, which threatens dugongs because they have been known to mistake plastic for seagrass.\n\nSome indigenous people also continue to hunt dugongs for their meat, skin, bones, oil, and teeth. There even used to be one other species in the same family as the dugong – the Hydrodamalis gigasto or Steller’s sea cow – that humans hunted down to extinction.\n\nIn 2019, the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) found an abandoned male dugong calf at the Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve. Separated from his mother, the barely one-month-old dugong was underweight, malnourished, and dehydrated. It looked like he was a lost cause, as dugongs depend on their mothers for at least 18 months.\n\nEAD’s team did not let the dugong’s bleak prospects prevent them from saving the calf. EAD took him to a specialized facility, managed by Worldwide Zoo Consultants, where veterinarians and zoologists monitored his condition round-the-clock alongside EAD. They cared for him, trained him to eat seagrass, and nursed him back to good health.\n\nThe dugong rescue’s name is Malquot - Arabic for “saved” and “one whose owner is not known.” He is now several years old. He was relocated to the animal rescue and rehabilitation facility at the Yas SeaWorld Research & Rescue Center in 2023, and his current new home is in the Abu Dhabi Ocean realm at SeaWorld Yas Island, Abu Dhabi.\n\nIs the dugong a whale? No, it’s not, but like a whale, it has a fluked or a notched, horizontally aligned tail. It is also a sea mammal. Thus, female dugongs have mammary glands that produce milk, and baby dugongs rely on that milk for sustenance. Like most mammals, moreover, they give birth to offspring.\n\nThe dugong is one of the only remaining species under the Dugongidae family of the order Sirenia. Here is the dugong’s detailed scientific classification:\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nSubphylum: Vertebrata\n\nClass: Mammalia\n\nSubclass: Theria\n\nInfraclass: Eutheria\n\nOrder: Sirenia\n\nFamily: Dugongidae\n\nSubfamily: Dugonginae\n\nGenus: Dugong\n\nSpecies: Dugong dugon\n\nWhat is the English name for a dugong?\n\nDugongs are usually referred to as sea cows. Note, however, that manatees are also called sea cows.\n\nAre dugongs just manatees? No, they’re not. While dugongs and manatees are collectively called sea cows, they are different species. They do not even belong to the same family since the dugong belongs to the Dugongidae family, while manatees are of the Trichechidae family.\n\nThat said, Dugongidae and Trichechidae belong to the same order – Sirenia – so they’re close cousins. There are only four Sirenian species left: one is the dugong, while the three are these species of manatees:\n\nTrichechus inunguis, also known as the Amazonian manatee\n\nTrichechus senegalensis, the West African manatee\n\nTrichechus manatus, the West Indian manatee\n\nSimilarities between dugongs and manatees\n\nThe dugong and manatees share many similarities. The following are some of these:\n\nThey are both gentle aquatic mammals with a plump, heavy body.\n\nThey have horizontally aligned tails and paddle-like flippers.\n\nThey both feed primarily on seagrass.\n\nThey move slowly across seagrass meadows, grazing as they go, thus, their sea cow nickname.\n\nDifferences between dugongs and manatees\n\nDugongs and manatees have many differences, too. The following are some of them:\n\nWater habitat: The dugong does not ever venture into freshwater areas. Manatees live both in freshwater and saltwater.\n\nFeeding habit: The dugong often feeds on the bottom, pulling seagrass out of the seabed with their mouths. Manatees graze on seagrass from the top or near the surface.\n\nMouth: The dugong has a broad, slit-like mouth. The muzzle on top makes the mouth look and function like a short trunk, and the upward-turning slit on the side makes the dugong look like it’s permanently smiling. Manatees have a shorter snout and an upper lip that is divided so the left and right sides can move somewhat independently.\n\nSkin: The dugong has smooth skin. Manatees have rough skin.\n\nTail: The dugong has a fluked tail like that of a dolphin. Its tail looks like two lobes separated by a deep central notch. Manatees have beaver-like tails, rounded and shaped like paddles.\n\nTusks: The dugong has a pair of tusk-like, overgrown incisors at the front of their mouth. This is especially obvious among adult male dugongs. Manatees don’t grow tusk-like incisors.\n\nShape: The dugong has a longer and slimmer body than manatees. Its body, flippers and tail can even make it look like a dolphin from afar. Manatees have a plumper and rounder body.\n\nLifespan: The dugong typically lives longer than manatees.\n\nSize: The adult dugong is typically shorter and lighter than adult manatees.\n\n“The dugong is not a whale or a manatee, although it’s the latter’s close cousin. It moves and grazes like a cow and looks like it’s perennially smiling.”"
