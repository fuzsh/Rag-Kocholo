        "text": "The dugong, a gentle giant of the ocean, is now \"functionally extinct\" in China, a new study said Wednesday.\n\nThere have been no records of dugongs in China's waters since 2008, researchers from the Zoological Society of London and the Chinese Academy of Sciences noted in their peer-reviewed study published in Royal Society Open Science.\n\nThe findings mark \"the first reported functional extinction of a large vertebrate in Chinese marine waters,\" the researchers write.\n\nHuman activities – such as fishing, habitat loss and ship strikes – have threatened dugongs around the world, the study said. The marine animal is also dependent on seagrass, which continues to be degraded by human impacts, despite recovery efforts working to towards restoration.\n\nThe dugong was previously known to frequent China's southern waters for centuries, but the country's dugong population began to \"decrease rapidly from 1975 onwards.\"\n\nWatch: In Madagascar, the dugong is also facing extinction\n\nStudy: Climate change could cause mass extinction of marine life in Earth's oceans\n\n“The likely disappearance of the dugong in China is a devastating loss. Their absence will not only have a knock-on effect on ecosystem function, but also serves as a wake-up call – a sobering reminder that extinctions can occur before effective conservation actions are developed,\" Samuel Turvey, a professor at ZSL’s Institute of Zoology and co-author of the study, stated in a ZSL press release.\n\nThe authors would \"welcome any possible future evidence\" that dugongs might still persist in China, the study says. But, through the extensive surveys conducted in their study, they found no recent evidence of the dugong's survival in the country.\n\nThe dugong's regional status should be reassessed as critically endangered (possibly extinct), the researchers note.\n\nWorldwide, the dugong is currently listed as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Animals.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Both \"sea cows\" are two species that belong to the Sirena order – \"a name reminiscent of mythical mermaids,\" the Smithsonian notes."
