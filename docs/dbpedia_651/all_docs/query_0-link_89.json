        "text": "Comparing Dugongs to Manatees:\n\n1. Size\n\nWhen comparing dugongs to manatees the most striking difference is in their sizes. In general, manatees grow much heavier, broader, and longer than dugongs. Dugongs average a length of around 9.8 feet/3 meters whereas manatees have an average length of 11 feet/3.35 meters. The average weight of a dugong is between 551 and 1,984 pounds whereas manatees weigh between 880 to 1,210 pounds. The large bracket given for average weight is due to the significant differences between males and females. In both dugong and manatee species, the female species tends to weigh substantially more than her male counterparts.\n\n2. Habitat and Geographical Distribution\n\nAlthough both from the Sirenian Order, Dugongs, from the Dugongidae family, and Manatees from the Trichechidae family occupy very different parts of the planet. Dugongs are found in the Indo-West Pacific (including North Sulawesi) from the coasts of East Africa to the waters of Northern Australia. To see manatees, however, you’ll need to visit the Amazon Basin, the Caribbean, or the Gulf of Mexico!\n\nIt’s not just their global distribution that marks dugongs apart from manatees. They also occupy different habitats. While dugongs spend their lives entirely in salt water, manatees can be found in both salt and fresh water. Both species however are largely found in coastal regions which tend to be a good source of food – mangroves for the salt-dwelling dugong and sea grasses or river beds for manatees.\n\n3. Snouts\n\nIn all Sirenians, the snout is one of the creatures most distinguishing characteristics, however, the finer details of the snout vary between manatees and dugongs. A manatee has a much shorter (and squashed-looking) snout than a dugong and manatee snouts also possess divided, prehensile lips.\n\nConversely, a dugong’s snout is longer than a manatees, resembling the trunk-like nose of an Aardvark. This long nose is not without purpose. It enables them to efficiently feed on seagrass growing on the sea floor.\n\n4. Tails\n\nWhile a dugong has a distinct fluked tail, similar to that of dolphins, manatees have a more rounded, paddle-shaped tail more like a beaver.\n\nThe differing tail shapes affect the way they move in the water. Dugongs, like dolphins, propel themselves by powerfully finning with their tail in an up and down motion, they are also lythe enough to be able to twist and quickly change direction. Manatees can only flap their tail up and down, making them slower and less agile.\n\n5. Diet and Feeding\n\nBoth manatees and dugongs primarily feed on seagrass which they forage from the sea beds of their coastal habitats.\n\nWhile dugongs are mainly herbivores, they will also feed on squid and octopus that they find while foraging. Manatees will feed on small fish in times when seagrass availability is low. While dugongs use their long noses to find and feed on seagrass because manatees have shorter snouts they also use their front ‘flippers’ to dig up seagrass from the roots.\n\n6. Mating and Reproduction\n\nEveryone loves a good love story and that’s what you get with dugongs! Dugongs are monogamous and mate for life. Only if one of the partners passes away will a dugong consider finding a new mate. Female dugongs reach sexual maturity at around 10 years old whereas female manatees reach maturity much younger, at just 3 years old. Manatees are polygamous and some males will have multiple female mates at the same time."
