        "meta_description": "Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are found in coastal waters across the Indo-Pacific. They are members of the order Sirenia, whose closest relatives are elephants, and are the only surviving species of the family Dugongidae. The dugong’s range includes over 40 countries from East Africa to Vanuatu in the Pacific, with Australia being home to the largest […]",

        "text": "Females produce their first calf between 6-18 years old and have a 14-month gestation. A newborn calf will suckle milk for up to 18 months and starts transitioning to seagrass as its main nutritional source, from only a couple of weeks after birth. Under ideal conditions, females will reproduce every 3-7 years. While they do suckle for up to 18 months, they start eating seagrass (including the rhizomes) from only a couple of weeks after birth.\n\nThe biological characteristics of dugongs and their lifestyle make them highly vulnerable to threats. They take a long time to reach sexual maturity and produce few calves in their lifetime, making it hard for dugong populations to recover from impacts that deplete their numbers, particularly adults. Human activities are a major threat to dugongs: they are affected by seagrass habitat loss, collision with boats, poaching, by-catch in fishing gear and pollution."
