        "text": "Dugong dugon, known as dugong or sea cow is the only herbivorous sea mammals. The dugong is the only species in the family Dugongidae and one of four living species of the order Sirenia. It is most closely related to the giant Stellerâ€™s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), which was hunted to extinction around 1768 by Russian fur traders (Phillipps, 2014). Their diet consists mainly of seagrass. Dugongs can be found in warm coastal waters from East Africa to Australia, including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Pacific. The major threats for dugongs are the hunting pressure, incidental capture, pollution, habitat loss and climate change. The decline of dugongs makes them to be assigned as Vulnerable under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species."
