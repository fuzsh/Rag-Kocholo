        "text": "Dugongs and sea cows\n\n(Dugongidae)\n\nClass Mammalia\n\nOrder Sirenia\n\nFamily Dugongidae\n\nThumbnail description\n\nLarge, fully aquatic marine herbivorous mammals\n\nSize\n\n9.8–32.8 ft (3–10 m); 881–13,000 lb (400–5,900 kg)\n\nNumber of genera, species\n\n2 genera; 2 species\n\nHabitat\n\nSteller's sea cow: coastal around Bering and Medney Islands; dugong: Indo-Pacific tropical and subtropical coastal waters where seagrasses occur\n\nConservation status\n\nExtinct: 1 species; Vulnerable: 1 species\n\nDistribution\n\nSteller's sea cow: western North Pacific around the Bering and Medney Islands; dugong: tropical and subtropical, coastal, Indo-Pacific\n\nEvolution and systematics\n\nThe oldest sirenians are from the early Eocene and are related to elephants, hyraces, and the extinct desmostylids. The Dugongidae appeared at the end of the Eocene. The subfamily Dugoninae probably appeared in the early to middle Oligocene, but the subfamily Hydrodamalinae did not appear until the early Miocene and was endemic to the North Pacific.\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nThe dugongids have a streamlined, nearly hairless body reaching a length of 9.8 ft (3 m) for the dugong (Dugong dugon) and 23–33 ft (7–10 m) for Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). They lack hind limbs, but do have vestigial pelvic bones embedded in the pelvic musculature. The tail is forked, similar to that of a cetacean's flukes. Forelimbs are shortened and flexible without nails. Body color is variable gray-brown; color is unknown for the sea cow. The dugong may weigh more than 881 lb (400 kg) and the Steller's sea cow is estimated to have weighed in excess of 9,920 lb (4,500 kg).\n\nDistribution\n\nThe recent dugongids are distributed disjunctively in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific (dugong) and western North Pacific (Steller's sea cow).\n\nHabitat\n\nThe dugongids occupy a coastal marine habitat dictated by the presence of sea grasses and macroalgae (sea cow only).\n\nBehavior\n\nIn general, the dugongids may be described as \"semi-social,\" with the primary social unit being the female and her calf. Little is known about the behavior of Steller's sea cow. The dugong may occur in herds numbering in the tens or hundreds in areas of abundant sea grass. Satellite-tracked dugongs have been shown to make regular, short distance (9–25 mi [15–40 km]) round-trip movements between feeding areas and warmer coastal areas. In tropical Australia, trips of 62–373 mi (100–600 km) have been documented over the course of a few days. Dugongs form mating herds with several males attempting to mate with a single female; males in a part of Western Australia establish and defend territories and display behaviors to attract females, a behavior known as lekking.\n\nFeeding ecology and diet\n\nThe dugongids are marine herbivores feeding almost exclusively on sea grasses (the dugong) and on macroalgae (Steller's sea cow). Steller's sea cows apparently fed on the surface and were not known to dive. Being toothless and the kelp being avascular, the sea cows crushed the kelp fronds between horny, keratinized plates at the front of their upper and lower jaws. If their digestive process were similar to those of living sirenians, they had a simple stomach, long intestines, and digestion occurred in the large intestine (hindgut) with the aid of anerobic microorganisms. The dugong is strictly a bottom feeder and, in some parts of its range, they ingest numbers of bottom-dwelling inverte-brates.\n\nIn some areas, at low tide, dugong-feeding trails are observed in the exposed sea grass beds. As with other living sirenians, the dugong is a hindgut digestor with long intestines and likely uses anerobic microorganisms to digest cellulose. Details are lacking.\n\nReproductive biology\n\nLittle is known about sirenian reproductive biology in general, and the dugongids are no exception. Typically, single calves are born after a gestation period of about a year and remain with the cow for more than a year. Male dugongs are not known to provide any parental care. Steller's sea cow reproductive biology is speculative. Steller wrote of family groups and suggested male-female pair bonding, which contrasts with the reproductive behavior of other living sirenians. Calves appear to have been seen at all times of the year, but may have been more common in autumn. This would suggest that mating occurred at most times of the year. Gestation period seems to have been at least one year, but may have been longer. Apparently only single calves were born. There are no data on age/size at sexual maturity or the degree of parental care. Steller's sea cows are thought to have been monogamous but dugongs exhibit a variety of reproductive behavior, from scramble competition polygamy to lekking.\n\nConservation status\n\nSteller's sea cow is Extinct, while the dugong is Vulnerable to extinction under IUCN criteria. CITES Appendix I lists the dugong as Endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act. Increasing human activity (boating, fishing, inland habitat destruction) in coastal dugong habitats has the potential for directly injuring dugongs (boat collisions, fishing gear entanglement) or for sea grass destruction from silt in river outflows. The largest dugong population is in Australia where incomplete population estimates have been 80,000 or more animals.\n\nSignificance to humans\n\nThe dugong has been hunted for meat, hides, and bone, and is of cultural significance to some indigenous peoples in the Indo-Pacific region. The Steller's sea cow was hunted to extinction. This event, in the mid-sixteenth century, shows how much pressure humans can exert on the environment.\n\nSpecies accounts\n\nList of Species\n\nSteller's sea cow\n\nDugong\n\nSteller's sea cow\n\nHydrodamalis gigas\n\nsubfamily\n\nHydrodamalinae\n\ntaxonomy\n\nHydrodamalis gigas (Zimmerman, 1780), Bering Island, Bering Sea.\n\nother common names\n\nEnglish: Great northern sea cow, rhytina.\n\nphysical characteristics\n\nExtremely large (23–33 ft [7–10 m] body length; 9,920–13,000 lb [4,500–5,900 kg] body mass), fully aquatic mammal; tail fluke-like; hind limbs absent; forelimbs lacking phalanges (finger bones); head relatively small; teeth absent.\n\ndistribution\n\nThe Steller's sea cow is unique among sirenians in that it inhabited the extremely cold waters around Medney and Bering Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.\n\nhabitat\n\nCoastal areas where macroalgae (kelp) grew.\n\nbehavior\n\nSeemed to be strictly coastal where the kelp grew and were reported as having some preference for the mouths of freshwater creeks. Apparently, they remained near the islands year-round and did not migrate.\n\nfeeding ecology and diet\n\nThe Steller's sea cow fed exclusively on several species of macroalgae (kelp) growing in the intertidal and subtidal areas around Bering and Medney Islands.\n\nreproductive biology\n\nVirtually nothing is known about the sea cow's reproductive biology, and the published information is speculative at best.\n\nconservation status\n\nDiscovered 1741 and hunted to extinction by 1767.\n\nsignificance to humans\n\nProvided a ready source of meat for the stranded sailors who discovered the species and for subsequent explorers who visited the islands. This is the only recent sirenian that has been sent to extinction by human activities.\n\nDugong\n\nDugong dugon\n\nsubfamily\n\nDugonginae\n\ntaxonomy\n\nDugong dugon (Müller, 1776), Cape of Good Hope to the Philippines.\n\nother common names\n\nEnglish: Seacow; French: Dugong: Spanish: Dugong, dugon.\n\nphysical characteristics\n\nHas gray-colored, nearly hairless skin; reaches a body length of about 9.8 ft (3 m) and a body mass of about 880 lb (400 kg); body streamlined and laterally compressed to some extent; tail fluke-like; hind limbs absent; forelimbs shortened and flexible; both sexes possess tusks, but they rarely erupt in the females.\n\ndistribution\n\nTropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific margin from eastern Africa to the Philippines and the South China and East China Seas where sea grasses may occur.\n\nhabitat\n\nCoastal, strictly saltwater, and relatively shallow depths (up to about 98 ft [30 m]) as determined by the presence of sea grass beds.\n\nbehavior\n\nThe primary social unit is the female and her calf. May form large (tens to hundreds of individuals) foraging herds.\n\nfeeding ecology and diet\n\nA bottom feeder that eats the leaves and roots of a number of species of sea grasses.\n\nreproductive biology\n\nFemale dugongs typically give birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about one year. Males compete for mating rights. Animals of both sexes mature at over 10 years of age. Calves nurse for about 18 months, but start eating sea grass within weeks of birth. Calving interval estimates range from three to seven years. Maximum longevity is 50–70 years.\n\nconservation status\n\nListed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Protected by various international and national regulations, but hunted by some indigenous peoples. There is no range-wide population estimate.\n\nsignificance to humans\n\nDugongs have been hunted for meat, fat, hides, and bones, and are of cultural significance to many indigenous peoples in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nResources\n\nBooks\n\nAnderson, P.
