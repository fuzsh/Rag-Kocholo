        "text": "Dugongs in Qatar: Then and Now\n\nPalaeontologists have discovered dugong fossils in Qatar. These fossils confirm that dugongs have lived here for millions of years. Today, dugongs live around Qatar. In the winter they can be found in two hot spots: in the southeast between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, and in the northwest between Qatar and Bahrain.\n\nDugongs can migrate long distances – even from one country to another!\n\nThey can be found alone or in pairs (a mother and a calf), but have been spotted in larger herds in north-west Qatar. Around this area, scientists have recorded the largest groups of dugongs (more than 600) swimming in the sea. Scientists from Qatar University, Texas A&M University at Galveston, and EMRQ (funded by the Qatar National Research Fund) are currently studying this unusual phenomenon.\n\nObserving Dugongs' Behaviour\n\nLike many other animals, dugongs have their own unique habits and behaviours. Dugongs live a semi-nomadic life: as calves with their mother and as grown-ups alone. Throughout their lives, they spend their time eating seagrass.\n\nScientists study their behaviour through observation. Still, we have limited information, as they can be very shy.\n\nRaising Calves\n\nDugongs and their calves share an intimate bond. Mothers usually give birth to one calf every three to six years. Calves grow up with their mother until they are about two years old, when they are mature enough to be on their own.\n\nMothers and calves communicate through touch. They touch each other’s flippers or rub their noses for reassurance. Calves climb on their mother’s back or swim underneath her for protection.\n\nEating Day and Night\n\nEating is the dugongs’ main activity! Dugongs eat seagrass found in shallow, clear, warm waters. Once they reach for their food, they use their muscular snouts and bristles to dig up the roots and pull the seagrass from the sea floor.\n\nThe fact that dugongs feed on seagrass is part of the seagrass meadow’s lifecycle.\n\nIn the short run, intense eating allows the seagrass to grow, which creates new habitat and nurseries for other inhabitants. In the long run, stirring up the sand and removing plants recycles nutrients and lets energy flow. This helps meadows develop and host more fish.\n\nDugongs eat around 40kg of seagrass per day.\n\nHow much food is 40kg? That's around 800 eggs or 180 burgers in weight! Although these numbers are mind-blowing, remember, seagrass is not as nutritious as our food. Dugongs have to eat this much to sustain themselves.\n\nHowever, they prefer seagrass, which is more nutritious and is easy to digest. This means that they give priority to quality and not to quantity.\n\nThe Dugongs’ Habitat\n\nSeagrass Meadow\n\nThe seagrass habitat is the dugong’s only source of nutrition and home to many different species of marine life. Seagrass meadows and their inhabitants support a life cycle that maintains biodiversity. However, fishing nets, boats and pollution disturb the balance of the ecosystem and threaten the dugong with extinction.\n\nSeagrass grows on the seabed, forming underwater meadows. These habitats play a vital role in supporting the Arabian Gulf’s ecosystems. They are a nursery and a shelter for species such as young fish, shrimps, and oysters. They are also an important source of food for many sea creatures, such as green sea turtles. In the Arabian Gulf, only three species of seagrass can be found due to high salt levels and extreme temperatures.\n\nSaving Dugongs' Habitat\n\nPlastic Pollution and Recycling\n\nPlastic is in great demand around the world. Because the material is durable, easy to shape, and inexpensive to produce, it is used in a great variety and number of products. But its popularity and durability have led to an increase in plastic pollution in the environment.\n\nRecycling can help reduce pollution. Recycled plastic can be repurposed into new products such as clothes and shoes, building materials, furniture, toys and different kinds of equipment. It can even be used to make new bottles that can be recycled once again.\n\nRecycling, however, can take time and energy, and at times it’s not even possible. What’s more, the same plastic can be recycled only two or three times. This is why recycling is only one part of the solution; reducing the use of plastic is another.\n\nIn Qatar, there are a few companies that offer recycling solutions.\n\nHow Can I Help?\n\nSaving the environment is an enormous challenge, but also very easy. We just need to change some of our habits.\n\nPlastic is the number one threat for underwater habitats. It does not decompose, it is toxic for the water, and a danger to animals. Scientists warn that if we do not change our lifestyle by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean.\n\nIn the north of Qatar, where dugongs have been spotted, plastic bottles and packages get washed up on the shore every day. It is in our hands to protect the sea and dugongs by simply following some of the tips offered here.\n\nAvoid Single-Use Plastic Products\n\nInvest in reusable water bottles and straws that you can wash and use again and again.\n\nRecycle\n\nIf you have to use single-use products, recycle them afterwards.\n\nEat Seafood Sustainably\n\nProtect the sea life by eating local fish and asking how your fish is caught and farmed.\n\nSave Water\n\nYou do not need to leave the tap running. Be mindful of the water you use!\n\nDispose of Waste Thoughtfully\n\nDo not throw your waste in the sea. Use the recycle bins when possible."
