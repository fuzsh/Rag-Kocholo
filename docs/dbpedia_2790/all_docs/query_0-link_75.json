        "text": "Can you believe that 1970 was fifty years ago this year? It’s unbelievable. Just think about how current so much of it feels. The electronic music that never left and only got stronger. The concept of the idiosyncratic celebrity like David Bowie or Cher. Okay, so the fashion and shaggy carpets never really came back, but there is a lot of influence from this time that never went away. A good portion of that influence is in cinematic form. Think about it: most of the films in the mainstream now, especially in Hollywood, are directly inspired by the waves of works from the seventies (thank you, New Hollywood). Then, there’s the French New Wave works that broke apart what films could be; the wave started earlier, but a lot of headway was made here by a number of filmmakers (excluding Jean-Luc Godard; his time will shine in the ‘60s list).\n\nThe seventies definitely makes its claim as one of the strongest time periods in all of cinema for a few reasons. Cross cultural influences were growing stronger than ever. Marginalized voices were being listened to at least a tiny bit more now than before; the rise of race related works, LGBTQ+ films, and feminist experiments was growing stronger. Things felt a little more grim with musicals slowing down (or at least changing into more serious fare), even though colour has completely taken over black and white as the predominant visual scheme now (ironically enough: Technicolor dies in this decade, too). A lot of movement was happening, yet there is a very distinctive feel here with the majority of films released. Filmmakers were foaming at the mouth to be more daring.\n\nSo, in return, we have many experimental works; this list of one hundred is, naturally, the weirdest and full of the most polarizing picks I have made yet. We have an influx of revisionist genre flicks, as well as the tail ends of styles that were well on their way out by now. The seventies called for change, and by golly that demand can still be felt today even just by skimming through these one hundred selections. So far, this has been the hardest list to compile by a large margin, and I figure this and the sixties will hurt the most (all of the great films I’ve had to cut; it’s killing me!). Nonetheless, I tried my best, and I’m happy with what I have here. Here are the best one hundred films of the 1970’s.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven’t included documentaries, or any film that is considerably enough of a documentary (mockumentaries don’t count). I haven’t forgotten about films like F for Fake or Grey Gardens. I’m keeping them in mind for later (wink wink).\n\nBe sure to check out my other Best 100 lists of every decade here.\n\n2. World on a Wire\n\nJust once in 1973, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s only science fiction project World on a Wire was shown. Its blending of futuristic imagery and early ‘70s German fashion and interior design just worked so well, and this unique prophecy already had viewers hooked. Then, the philosophical take on perception kept everyone glued. After that, that was it. World on a Wire was a television film in two parts that just vanished, outside of the reported occasional airing. It was either a memory for inspired storytellers, or a product of hearsay for others. It wasn’t until quite recently (2010) that the entire world could see World on a Wire again, and it has become an anomaly in cinema. For a film as influential as it was, nothing feels like World on a Wire, because the instruction booklet got lost over time, and filmmakers were left to their own devices. Even if it wasn’t so individualistic in style, World on a Wire is an exhilarating take on futuristic singularity, creating a tormenting second act where an entire world flips on you. World on a Wire was a vision of the future that became the cinematic future, and it has still yet to be caught up to.\n\n1. Chinatown\n\nRight from the very first scene, the film noir of old is destroyed. J. J. Gittes asks a client to stop ruining his Venetian blinds: a common noir trope. It was no secret that film noir was in need of a comeback, but how could you top Sunset Boulevard, In a Lonely Place, and other works that perfected the style? Besides, films were becoming colourful now, and black and white was finally getting abandoned for the most part in the ‘70s. Films noir couldn’t really come back. They had to be reborn. The scrunching of those Venetian blinds in sepia tinged colour is how Chinatown let us know that this was the reincarnation the world needed. Chinatown wasn’t the first neo-noir, if you want to split hairs, but it was the definitive neo-noir, particularly because of how close to home it stayed. Most newer films of this style veer off course as much as possible. Chinatown worked with all of the old ways, but tried to use them in a New Hollywood setting. Films could finally be risky in Hollywood. We had to see how much darker films noir could be.\n\nCrafted by the greatest screenplay of all time by Robert Towne (with Roman Polanski’s version of the conclusion that’s much more affective, let’s be honest), Chinatown is as literary as a film can get. You can almost feel the descriptions and dialogue from a novel ooze off the screen. Our protagonist is investigator Gittes, who carries a permanent resentment on his shoulders. He has ghosts that follow him, just like he is hired to tail others. His time in the titular Chinatown didn’t go so well, and he has tried to start a new life elsewhere to no avail. We are mostly caught up in his Mulwray case that obviously goes off the rails, but nobody can predict just how far the film is willing to go. Even after the twist, there are still many more, and Chinatown refuses to ease off. It gets as lifeless as possible, right down to the chilling end that ended films noir once and for all, with neo-noir to stay. “As little as possible” just couldn’t cut it, and it took the sacrifice of a token noir detective to face the worst side of humanity for neo-noir to flourish.\n\nIn a decade dominated by cynical films, the rise of dangerous American works, and the reinvention of old ways, Chinatown reigns supreme. It is unforgiving with how ugly all of its characters get, because there is no time to justify the flaws of everyone in a film where true evils are unimaginable. On first watch, Chinatown is a guessing game that most people lose. Every watch after, Chinatown is us trying to shoo away the inevitable, only to see it all happen again. We are Gittes, reliving these nightmares. Chinatown is everywhere, now; it’s not a location, but a past. Gittes is forever doomed in his cinematic prison, and we cannot help him any time we try. Never has a shift from the ways of old to the new been so blatant in cinema, particularly within a genre or style either. Chinatown may have been made to recreate a story of yesteryear, but it ended up claiming New Hollywood, the ‘70s, and essentially American cinema entirely. It embodies American filmmaking’s past and present with a sign of what was to come. It is suspended in time, furthering the limbo-nature of the narrative even more. Chinatown is the greatest film of the 1970’s, despite not feeling like it belongs in any era, to tell you the truth."
