        "text": "Now and then, I do something really stupid. Usually whatever it is involves electricity, fire, or a sharp object, but this time my muse of stupidity is a movie. I am going to try to make sense out of \"El Topo.\" It is a creative film, filled with memorable symbolism, scenes that confound the viewer, and characters who belong in separate asylums (to prevent them from ganging up on reality). I love it. I cannot, however, explain it. The story contains threads of Christianity, but it pulls heavily from Buddhism. If you started slapping me with a fish, saying, \"This is Buddhism.\" I could not tell if you were serious or using it as an excuse to assault me.\n\nI would, however, tell you to stop hitting me with the fish.\n\nWe are introduced to El Topo and Hijo as the pair rides through the empty desert. Dismounting, the father instructs his son to bury his first toy and a picture of his mother in the sand. He is now a man and must start his journey. What is really strange about the scene is that the young boy is completely naked. This probably represents his inexperience and innocence; it's still weird.\n\nContinuing on, El Topo discovers a devastated town. The streets are awash in blood, while corpses are strewn about. Adorning his fingers with jeweled rings, the gunfighter rides into the desert and is quickly accosted by three bandits. Those are dispatched, but not before one of them is tortured (yes, shooting someone in the kneecaps is torture) and forced to reveal that the slaughter at the village is the work of a man called the Colonel.\n\nThe Colonel and the rest of his loyal bandidos are busy terrorizing yet another town. Actually, the villagers have it pretty bad, but the outlaws spend a lot of time abusing a quartet of Spanish monks. The Colonel spends his time being with a demure woman; eventually he casts her to his pack of loyal dogs as a reward for being so freaking nasty to the monks. Before you can say \"gang-raped by a crowd of bearded men,\" El Topo busts in and catches the Colonel with his pants down. The first thing that the bandit king should ask his adversary is, \"Why is your kid naked?\" but the subject is never broached. The two men just face off for a duel, with the expected results.\n\nMaybe you did not expect El Topo to shoot the Colonel's toupee off his head, then see the Colonel stripped naked, castrated, and stumble off, only to place his own pistol in his mouth and commit suicide. However, you did anticipate the evil leader of the bandidos would lose.\n\nUnfortunately, El Topo does not recognize the greatest danger in the dusty village. That would be Mara. The woman comes between the gunfighter and his son. As the protagonist rides off into the desert, it is Mara, not Hijo, accompanying him. El Topo attempts to teach Mara how to survive in the lifeless wasteland, including digging turtle eggs out of the shifting ground and shooting rocks to bring forth water. No good, she cannot get the hang of it. To make the woman believe in him, the gun-wielding pilgrim rapes her on the burning sand. It must be difficult to not believe in someone who has done that to you, because Mara turns into an egg-finding and water-dowsing fool. The wonders are not enough. Unlike the unconditional love of the cast off progeny, the woman demands that El Topo become the greatest gunfighter in the world to earn her love. He must defeat the four Master Gunfighters.\n\nThe First Master lives in a simple tower, attended by a pair of servants who made me think of The Crippled Masters. The serene Master does not seek to be the best; he seeks personal clarity. El Topo realizes that the Master Gunfighter is superior, but Mara insists that he find a way to win, even if it requires devious methods. As it happens, a dirty trick lays low the First Master.\n\nDesconcida appears around now and trails after El Topo, vicariously enjoying the pilgrim's victories and unsuccessfully trying to lure Mara away. The one thing she does that tempts Mara is to give the woman a mirror. Mara spends all of her time gazing at her own reflection, even when El Topo makes love to her. That finally gets on the gunfighter's nerves and he shoots the mirror.\n\nSeven years bad luck? Not good for someone on a spiritual journey in the desert. Bad luck could mean getting lost, or worse (I wonder if the Israelites' problem was that they kept breaking mirrors).\n\nThe Second Master Gunfighter is less troublesome than the first. He is a pillar of strength (yet loves fragile objects), but also hopelessly devoted to his mother. El Topo spreads the shards of Mara's mirror on the ground and gets the drop on the Master after the mother carelessly steps on them. It never pays to be a mamma's boy.\n\nThe Third Master is my favorite. He lives in a large corral with hundreds of rabbits hopping about inside. After El Topo arrives, the rabbits begin to die. Out of the four Master Gunfighters and their themes, I like this strange litmus test of El Topo's tarnished intent the best. Could it be that the stress of having an unknown person among them is too much for the nervous little bunnies and causes their hearts to burst? I am not so sure. Growing up, we had rabbits. If a rabbit was ever going to die from hypertension, it would have been my nephew's pet bunny. Do not get me wrong, the animal did pass away, but I would blame that on Nick feeding it things like cookies, any number of noxious-appearing plants (I think he might have fed it poison oak at one point), and even hot dogs.\n\nMy rabbit was named Roger, but it turned out that Roger was, actually, a female. It was hard enough for a young boy to put up with owning a pet rabbit; having one that was also a girl was too much. Rogeretta had to go.\n\nAgain, the Gun Master is overcome through cheating, leaving El Topo in command of a corral filled with rabbit carcasses and one dead human. He piles the rotting bunnies on top of their master, effectively creating a cairn out of dead rabbits. I'm uncertain if this was a gesture of respect or an insult. If anyone buries me under a thick layer of lifeless rabbits, I will come back from the dead and be mighty riled.\n\nThe fourth Master is an old man who possesses nothing and covets nothing. He is happy having nothing. Defeating him is an insurmountable task. The venerable gunfighter easily avoids El Topo's wild punches, and when the questing protagonist fires at him, the Fourth Gun Master catches the bullet with a butterfly net. Even worse, once the old man realizes that El Topo wants to take his life, he simply picks up El Topo's gun and shoots himself.\n\nIf you ever want to have some fun, try telling a rabid capitalist, \"I have nothing that you can take. That which you would take, you are unable, but it is nothing to me.\" They actually foam at the mouth.\n\nDeprived of his ultimate victory, El Topo staggers through the desert. At the grave of each Master Gunfighter, he finds that his vanquished opponents, even in death, are still more than he. The rotting rabbit cairn bursts into flame, which is about the same thing that my vengeful spirit would do (again - do not pile dead bunnies on me after I die). Worse yet, El Topo is betrayed by Mara and Desconcida and left for dead, but rescued by a group of the forsaken and deformed.\n\nThe film often goes five or ten minutes without anyone speaking, the story continuing by the visual narrative. Now, this might sound irritating, but it is not. There is plenty going on to occupy the audience and the lack of dialog allows you to absorb everything. A complicated story like this would probably be an incomprehensible mess if a lot of spoken lines were included. The music is also amazingly well-tuned. Simple, but effective, and it feels like what we are seeing.\n\nBest that I can tell, El Topo spends about three decades comatose, worshipped by the unique group which rescued him. Awaking, the man who was once a master gunfighter has changed. He is born again as a pious monk and partnered with the dwarf woman who has spent her entire life caring for his inert form. El Topo's only goal is to improve the life of the misshapen villagers. To do that, he will dig a tunnel between the cave and a nearby town.\n\nThe town that the misshapen want to reach seems to be America. Triangles decorated with the all-seeing eye are prominently displayed everywhere. Law is a fat sheriff. Men pretend to operate cozy saloons, but the real action takes place in secret speakeasy rooms that are filled with bimbos and moonshine. Meanwhile, the women are all hideous brutes that speak about decency, though they are little more than wrinkled old cesspools filled with sludge and lust. Last, but not least, African-Americans are slaves who probably wish that the American brand was just a simple triangle, without the all-seeing eye (I imagine that anyone being branded would pick a simple design over something elaborate).\n\nThat is a pretty whacked view of the United States, is it not? Before you get all up in arms, remember that everything in this film is portrayed in an extreme manner. Taken literally, Desconcida's character indicates that lesbians are all wicked girlfriend-stealers who can lick a cactus apart with their tongue. Oh, and pilgrims spend most of their search for spiritual enlightenment either contributing to the extinction of endangered species or shooting at random objects (people, rocks, birds) to discover if doing so brings them any closer to God.\n\nWith a combination of back-breaking labor and comedy skits to beg for money, El Topo and Mujercita work on the tunnel. What threatens to keep El Topo from realizing his goal is the sudden appearance of Hijo. El Topo's son is now the spitting image of what his old man was when the film began: a black-clad death-dealer. He is also angry at his father for abandoning him. Fortunately, a compromise is worked out. Hijo will kill his father after the tunnel is completed.\n\nUnfortunately, finishing the tunnel results in the Americans shooting the onrushing tide of forsaken dwarfs and deformed villagers. El Topo goes nuts! Want to know what is more terrifying than a god-like being? A crazy god-like being. Just look at all of Lovecraft's stories. If Nyarlathotep wore Bermuda shorts and baked cookies, most people wouldn't be afraid of him. However, a huge thing with a tentacle instead of a head, howling its madness into the dark of night in a forsaken wood, is pretty freaking scary. Those Americans who survive El Topo's wrath flee into the desert as quickly as possible. The grieving protagonist reserves a special fate for himself.\n\nHaving written all of this, I feel like Don Quixote, except my windmill looks like a huge, multi-limbed Jesus (which would make more sense if the religious mix was Hinduism and Christianity). The next time you want to watch a mind bending film, see this movie. Whether you like it or not, \"El Topo\" is a memorable experience."
