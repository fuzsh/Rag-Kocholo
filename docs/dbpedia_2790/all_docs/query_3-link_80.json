I'm about to watch El Topo for the first time and I think it would be cool to get a discussion going regarding the sound to such a strange movie. If anybody wants to contribute, that would be cool.\n\nSo I watched the movie. Great movie, very artsy, I loved the whole idea of it. The sound was overdone in a way to add to the exaggeration that is El Topo. Mostly, the fx were mixed more loudly than expected which perhaps was an intentional effect. Some strange sync issues did occur with footsteps once. The music was great.\n\nanswered Aug 26, 2011 at 1:17\n\nChrisSoundChrisSound\n\n1,01022 gold badges88 silver badges1414 bronze badges"
