Just listing some of Jodorowsky's other activities in addition to his filmmaking may give some indication of both of the characteristics listed above, at least in terms of how the combination of them all being done by one person might be perceived by outsiders as indicating both visionary and mad aspects. Jodorowsky at various points in his long life (as of the writing of this review, he's still with us at the venerable age of 91) has been a puppeteer, a composer, a mime, a writer of comics, a therapist and a self- described mystic with a penchant for magical realist and/or surrealist thinking. Jodorowky first came to at least some prominence on the global cinema scene with El Topo in 1970, though Fando y Lis, also included in this set, preceded it by two years, causing more than a bit of a scandal upon its release, including being rather quickly banned in Mexico after its debut, something that probably kept it from greater renown at the time. El Topo at least managed to screen internationally, including in New York City, where it caught the attention of none other than John Lennon, who convinced Apple executive Allen Klein to fund further Jodorowsky efforts. This set also aggregates two other films from Jodorowsky, including 1973's The Holy Mountain (one result of Klein's financing efforts), which, like El Topo, has had a previous release on Blu-ray (more about the previous releases in the appropriate individual reviews of those titles). Bookending the never before released on Blu-ray Fando y Lis, the first feature length film from Jodorowsky, is Psychomagic, A Healing Art, Jodorowsky's most recent effort from 2019.\n\nNote: Those who pay attention to things like menu designs and fonts utilized, or even to the look of the copyright warnings at disc boot up may instantly recognize how these discs look like Arrow releases, with an identical boot up that is only different from an Arrow release in that it's missing the Arrow masthead. That said, in fact Arrow's own masthead does show up here on occasion with regard to some of the supplemental material. Arrow's UK division has their own The Alejandro Jodorowsky Collection Blu-ray release which came out about a month or so ago. That release looks like it has Region B locked discs (I haven't received any screeners yet, and so can't confirm), but otherwise the releases seem to be identical.\n\nEl Topo is one of two films in this set that has had a previous release on Blu-ray, and for those interested in a plot recap I recommend reading Martin Liebman's El Topo Blu-ray review of the release put out by Starz / Anchor Bay in 2011. Marty's review is also a good resource for screenshot comparisons and differences between the slate of supplements.\n\nEl Topo Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nEl Topo is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of abkco with AVC encoded 1080p transfers in 1.37 and 1.85. The insert booklet contains the following information on the transfer:\n\nEl Topo was restored in 4K resolution and both Spanish and English versions are presented in 1.85:1 and 1.33:1 [sic] aspect ratios with 5.1, stereo and mono Spanish audio, and English mono audio*. The original 35mm camera negative and intermediary elements were scanned in 4K resolution at OCN Digital Labs, CT. The film was graded and restored at Silver Salt Restoration, London. The audio mixes were remastered from the optical negatives at Deluxe Audio Services, Hollywood. Review screenings for approval were carried out at Eclair Labs, Paris.\n\nMarty gave very decent if not overwhelming marks to the previous release on Blu-ray, but my hunch is even those who liked the Starz / Anchor Bay release are going to find this version an improvement on any number of levels. First of all, there's a noticeable grain field, one that is rather fine at times and can ebb and flow on occasion (especially against some of the brighter backgrounds), but something that generally gives an appealing depth and texture to the visuals. The Arrow release looks a bit darker to me, something that helps improve the perception of saturation in many of the outdoor sequences, where the bright blue skies or deep red rivers of blood pop with a good deal of authenticity. Detail levels are excellent across the board, especially in the ubiquitous close-ups. A few midrange shots can look a bit fuzzy, and there are a couple of noticeable downturns in quality where the color skews slightly towards blues and purples and the grain field becomes rather gritty, which I'm assuming may stem at least in part from the \"intermediary elements\" alluded to above.\n\nThis new release offers a \"director's aspect ratio\" of 1.85:1, which was evidently done by Jodorowsky as an homage to the films of Sergio Leone. I've attempted to do a couple of things with the screenshots accompanying this review. First of all, screenshots 1 through 10 are in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio, and screenshots 11 through 19 are in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. I've tried to offer similar screenshots between the two aspect ratios, while at the same time offering close comparisons to some of the screenshots Marty included with his review, so that those interested can go back and forth and see what they think. I will say that my hunch is some may think the 1.85:1 framing looks pretty tight on occasion, especially with regard to some of those aforementioned close-ups, where there simply isn't a ton of \"wiggle room\" and things like the tops or bottoms of heads and/or faces can get lopped off (though to be fair, Jodorowsky frames things quite often in 1.37:1 with some of the same results in terms of parts of heads or faces not being in the frame).\n\n*I found no way to play the English dub in 1.85:1. The English dub is included as an extra (so that even trying to access an audio setup via a Pop Up Menu doesn't work) and is in 1.37:1. Also, there is no stereo track of any kind on this disc.\n\nEl Topo Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nEl Topo features the original Spanish language version in either DTS-HD Master Audio Mono or DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Marty wasn't especially impressed by the audio on the first Blu-ray, but I have to say I'm probably somewhat more generally pleased with both that version and this new version. Yes, the audio is a product of its time and Jodorowsky's less than fulsome budget, and as such there can be a pretty boxy ambience to a lot of the sonics, but sound effects like the ubiquitous whistling winds and especially some of the rather remarkable score sound surprisingly robust and full bodied. The surround track does a good job of opening up those elements in particular, but as Marty noted, this is not a \"showy\" surround track featuring nonstop immersion. Dialogue is rendered cleanly and clearly throughout, and I noticed no issues with regard to any major age related signs of wear and tear.\n\nEl Topo Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nEnglish Dub Version (1080p; 2:04:58) is in DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (and the 1.37:1 aspect ratio).\n\nAudio Commentary by Alejandro Jodorowsky\n\nJodorowsky Remembers El Topo (1080p; 12:56) features a 2019 interview with Jodorowsky. This is in English, but comes with optional subtitles.\n\nAn Introduction to El Topo by Richard Peña (1080p; 9:31) features the Professor of Film Studies from Columbia university in a good overview, including how El Topo helped to put Jodorowsky on the map for such people as John Lennon.\n\nA Conversation with the Son of El Topo (1080p; 19:26) is an interview with Jodorowsky's son Brontis, who was the (naked) little boy in the film.\n\nThe Father of Midnight Movies (1080p; 6:58) is an archival interview with Jodorowsky from 2007.\n\nOriginal Trailer (1080p; 4:16)\n\nImage Galleries\n\nProduction Stills (1080p)\n\nPosters (1080p)\n\nPress Materials and Review (1080p)\n\nOriginal Script (1080p)\n\nSoundtrack CD\n\nEl Topo Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\nI guess if we were going to define a genre with a regionally known food, a la legendary \"spaghetti westerns\", it might be jokingly appropriate to think of El Topo as a \"burrito western\" (or whatever your favorite south of the border Chilean munchable might be), but that would hardly come close to capturing this film's unique spirit and especially its visceral presentational style. This is full of Jodorowsky's patently odd approaches, including featuring his then young son completely naked for the duration of the film. Technical merits are generally solid, and the supplemental package outstanding.
