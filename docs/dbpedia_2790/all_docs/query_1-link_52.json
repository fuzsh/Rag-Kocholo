        "text": "After coming upon the scene of a horrifying massacre, roaming gunslinger El Topo demands justice. He learns that the atrocity was committed by someone named The Colonel, and after tracking down the villain and his equally vile men, the mystery man murders them all. A young woman is so grateful to be released from the Colonel's bondage that she agrees to ride with El Topo. But she does not love him and will only pledge her devotion if he kills the four greatest guns in the desert. One by one, El Topo finds the fiends and destroys them. But he is eventually double-crossed, finding himself left for dead among an underground collective of deformed freaks. Vowing to change his ways, he commits to building a tunnel between the cave and the local town. Little does he know that the people in the surrounding village purposefully shunned these lost souls and will do anything--including murder--to keep them away."
