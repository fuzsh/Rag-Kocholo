BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)  Adrian Paunescu, Romania’s most famous poet, who remained popular among his countrymen despite his praise for the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, died here on Friday. He was 67.

The cause was multiple organ failure, the Floreasca Emergency Hospital said. His last poem was written last Sunday from his hospital bed.

Mr. Paunescu, a prolific writer who was both physically huge and a larger-than-life character, appeared on television several times a week.

During the Communist era, he wrote flattering poems about Ceausescu that critics said contributed to the dictator’s personality cult. Still, Mr. Paunescu’s verse, often sentimental and melancholy, struck a chord with many Romanians.

In a message of condolence, President Traian Basescu of Romania thanked Mr. Paunescu for helping a generation of young artists but did not mention the poet’s involvement in politics.

Mr. Paunescu was born in the Soviet Union, in what is now Moldova, and moved to Romania as a child. He is survived by his wife and three children.
