        "text": "\"ROMANIAS FUTURE (VIITORUL ROMANIEI)\" ..................................................................................................................................\n\nTranslated from Romanian by:\n\nConstantin Roman 2000.\n\nNote:\n\nAdrian Paunescu, (b. 1943) - Ceausescu's Official Poet, Nationalist Party Leader, Senator - \"Viitorul Romaniei\" publ. 1983\n\n..................................................................................................................................\n\n\"We now live a new life, which was dreamt of and fought for\n\nBy our forbears, our national revolutionaries Tudor, Balcescu\n\nHoria and Iancu, who were once upon a time\n\nThe martyrs of our sufferings and of Romanias fate\n\nToday their heir is this wise old man, brought to us in Spring time\n\nTo be a hero amongst heroes. As Communist Party Leader,\n\nIt stands to reason that he is also the countrys President.\n\nAnd that is why, through the very person of Ceausescu we found our own newborn ethos.\n\nWe too are bearing the burden of past wars through our dead\n\nAs we paid the price of life to enjoy our earthly goods\n\nTherefor it follows that the source of sunshine does not come from Abroad, but that we have our very own Sun emerging from our capital city Bucharest.\n\nIt is Ceausescu himself that introduced honour within the Communist Party and the Country\n\nHe rediscovered our history unadulterated\n\nTo make us reach for the future in our dreams, as well as\n\nIn our daily deeds, full of new meanings.\n\nThat is why we always said and are still saying and will always say\n\nEvery minute of our lives, be it good or bad\n\nThat the Communist Party is strong, as it is nurtured by the whole Nation\n\nAs the Party represents the People at atomic level.\n\nAnd for this very reason as Leader who embodies the whole People\n\nHe will, of course feel their desires and all their wishes\n\nAnd that is why the Communist Party opens new vistas,\n\nA future made of enthusiasm and difficulties which are overcome.\n\nWe cant accept that our life should be broken\n\nAs we make history day in, day out, the way it was prescribed\n\nBy the 9th Congress of the Communist Party\n\nWhose philosophy is to believe in the People as the ultimate solution\n\nWe were disinherited of our history to forget our forbears\n\nBut he inspired us with a new sense of History\n\nAs he explained to us that our Homeland cannot be reduced\n\nJust to red flags, but above all flies our national three-coloured flag\n\nThat allowed our heroes to come home from their legendary Existence, to enjoin the\n\nHistory this very day of the Party Congress\n\nFrom old deeds to contemporary deeds\n\nInspired by the strength of Prince Michael the Brave.\n\nBut the future is ours, let it be known by all\n\nOur future will get better and better, by the day.\n\nO, eternal Romania, you will shine under the sun,\n\nAlways open as a hand, united as a fist.\n\nNew cities will be built and villages will be born\n\nTomorrow the Carpathians will be our foundations\n\nOf ever new epochs and new civilizations\n\nAnd the folk who live here will be proud as these mountains\n\nBut the most important and most beautiful aims\n\nFor which we struggled so much\n\nIs the very man who is at home in his own country\n\nAnd who is never lonely where ever he may be,\n\nBecause this intimacy he experiences with the greater Romania\n\nIs no other than the expression of Communism which we are building\n\nA system which does not gage us according to our possessions\n\nBut for what we are and we had achieved\n\nThis difficult tasks exacts great sacrifices\n\nAs we build our country from the foundation to the roof\n\nBecause no solution is ever found with a simple veni, vidi vici\n\nAnd as imported solutions dont exist\n\nAnd just as no dogma will keep us warm in winter\n\nWe shall bring to reality the great ideals\n\nAs we build the future together, during our best years\n\nWhich are equally difficult years.\n\nNotwithstanding all that the centre of our struggle remains\n\nThe Communist Party who knows the problem and has the solution\n\nThe Party is the architect of all our future\n\nThe perfect judge of our past and present\n\nThat is the stuff of which Romanias hero is made\n\nA true heroes through every fibre\n\nThe first recipient of the Truth\n\nWho knows how to confront all Evil\n\nAbove all our heroes can separate the grain from the chaff\n\nAnd is sensitive to the pains of the lowly\n\nConscious of the responsibility that is bestowed upon him\n\nHe knows how to act in the best interests of the country\n\nHow many fashionable ideas remain now moth eaten\n\nHaving lived a short glory, soon to be extinguished\n\nAs the People paid the price of the absurd egos\n\nExacted in blood and tears for an absurd whim\n\nAs we follow our Hero, we overcome disasters\n\nAs we follow our Hero we shall be able to\n\nMake everything to the measure of our enthusiasm\n\nYou People with a noble spirit, People with a pure soul. \"\n\n\"Adrian Paunescu Eulogising Nicolae Ceausescu\"\n\n..................................................................................................................................\n\nTranslated from Romanian by:\n\nConstantin Roman 2000.\n\nNote:\n\nAdrian Paunescu, (b. 1943) - Ceausescu's Official Poet, Nationalist Party Leader, Senator.\n\n..................................................................................................................................\n\nHis thoughts are all embracing, which makes one realise\n\nThat he belongs to this Country, that he is a real man\n\nWho was orphaned of his father and mother\n\nTo be adopted by the Nation as His dad and by the Country as His mum\n\nSuddenly one feels so close to ones contemporaries\n\nAnd ones soul has the urge to shower him with eulogies\n\nTo wish him many happy and safe years ahead\n\nShowered by the apple blossoms from the nations orchards\n\nYou, sons of Romania, if anybody asks you\n\nWhy have you gathered here and whom you celebrate?\n\nWhy do you hold in your hearts, in your thoughts and your speak\n\nThis man why do you love Him so dearly, may I ask?\n\nTo this we may answer singly and severally\n\nTo those who would hasten to ask such questions\n\nThis is no flattery as we portray Him\n\nWe love him for his struggle and His humanity.\n\nWe love Him because this Country is free under the sun\n\nThe People of this country are free and the real leader\n\nWe love him because He embodies the conscience of the Working people\n\nAnd that he makes us proud that as a man He is Romanian\n\nWe love Him, as he does not wish the world divided\n\nIn spheres of influence, downtrodden by tyrants,\n\nSo that every country should live within fair boundaries\n\nAnd that (the nations) should not be sold for cannon fodder\n\nWe love Him, because he holds in his heart the pining\n\nTo toil for his countrys prosperity\n\nAll our former ruling Princes hold his arm\n\nAnd our ancestors whisper words of wisdom in his ear\n\nFriends should you wish to ponder more deeply\n\nAs to what He had achieved since he took the helm of His country?\n\nWell, He preserved his kindness, His compassion and His humane demeanour\n\nAnd his feats of arms, make Him our foremost soldier\n\nAs there were no disasters or any sorrows\n\nWhich he did not confront abreast\n\nThat is why by naming Him our National Hero\n\nHe remains indeed our National Hero of Right\""
