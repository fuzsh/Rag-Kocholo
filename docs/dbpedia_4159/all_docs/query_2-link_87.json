        "text": "The purpose of the research was to reveal the hidden ingredients that can make migration successful in a European society prone, to immigrant phobia. The case of the Chinese migration to Romania was studied as an apparently paradoxical one: with all the factors that normally trigger immigrant phobia in place, the coexistence of the dominant and migrant group is peaceful. The study was conducted as a quantitative research meant to test the hypothesis that the positive attitude of Romanians towards Chinese migrants is influenced by their early and exclusive contact with the Chinese imported goods, during the Communist dictatorship of Ceausescu. In turn, the hypothesis was derived by using theories, secondary data and the author’s previous knowledge. Data on both independent and dependent variables were collected by a poll financed with the author’s own funds and done by a specialized institute, and then analyzed using SPSS to test the degree of correlation and signification. The resul...\n\nIn the columns published by Ioan Petru Culianu in the foreign media he proved to be concerned with the threat of illicit dominance, totalitarianism, intolerance and racism. The major part of his political and cultural articles were published in the Romanian language magazines Free World, Agora, Limits, Meridian, Ethos and in the foreign languages magazines Panorama, Mondoperaio and Nouvelle Acropole and the scientific studies were published in international journals such as Aevum, Dialogue, Neophilologus. In the political articles, Culianu tried to analyze the concepts of totalitarianism, communism, and racism and its origins as well as the individual’s right to resources and power and where that claim could become illegal and dangerous for the others. In this regard, the column The Racist Offence, original title L’offense raciste is an historical argumentative discourse within which Culianu analyzes the racism origins in the international context. The article was published in January 1985 in the French magazine Nouvelle Acropole. Culianu absolutely acknowledges himself as a “convinced anti-racist” right from the beginning and claims he is a total supporter of the democratic system as the ideal option for the most functional modern society. Culture, religion and politics are subtly connected in nowadays society as racist attitude is generated by wrong beliefs, ethereal ideas and massive intolerance. Racism is a phenomenon explained as having its origins in prejudices and preconceptions, it stems from inability to accept equal rights and mutual understanding, arrogance, perfidy and lack of respect for the human being."
