        "text": "I found myself wrapped up in nostalgia. I don’t know if it is because The Romanian National Day has came and gone and my family showered me with pictures of the parade, or maybe because it is nearly Christmas. We are celebrating birthdays this month as well. God help 2 Sagetarians in one household 🙂 So that could also be it.\n\nSo I reached for my little home from home that’s always by my bed side, the best of the best of Romanian poets. OK, I wasn’t the most studious pupil at school, so I may have missed a few of the earlier ones. But Adrian Paunescu is by far my bestest.\n\nSince I really have lived here and there, I thought it would be fun to get into the battle of the words.\n\nThen I thought it would be fun to try and translate some of the poems, I thought that some of my English speaking friends would love reading them, but I realized there is no way that would be possible. How do you translate the beauty of your mother’s tongue? The words that only come to life if you know them from the inside of your soul? Some of our best Romanian words can not be translated. And would we really want to?\n\nLet me give you an example.\n\nDalbe flori si leru-i ler. I can not even imagine translating the whole poem when I don’t have English words for “ Dalbe” and “Ler” It crashes the whole essence, these words somehow tell you more than you think. The best I can think is that “dalbe” means pure or clean or untouched. And then, they went and put this to music. Oh, you will just have to listen, you don’t even have to speak Romanian.\n\nTry this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4aT5kt7AH\n\nYou will have a giggle with the video if nothing else. Very communist, almost like an advert to a wedding venue. I wonder what our Eddy S would of come up with!\n\nSo the poem goes something like this:\n\n“Eu vin la nunta ta iubito I come to your wedding my love\n\nSi nu doresc nimic sa-ti cer And I don’t wish to ask you for anything\n\nDoar roaga nasii sa ma lase Just ask the godparents to allow me\n\nSa-ti cant la nunta leru-i ler To sing at your wedding ….. (Here is where “Leru-i ler” comes in, you see my problem?)\n\nLet’s carry on\n\nDreptul sa-ti colind il cer My right to sing to you (Christmas Carols) I demand\n\nDalbe flori si leru-i ler (Translation missing*)\n\nPentru ea, doar pentru ea For her and only for her\n\nMaritata mea. My married one.\n\n* and again.. Dalbe flowers and the ler is ler) – I can only ever remember “ler” being used around winter holidays which, in Romania it’s Christmas.\n\nWhat a mess! Sorry Adrian Paunescu.\n\nI have one that is so much fun.\n\nIf I had so say to my brother: “ Pai mai Ioane”. Nothing aggressive, I call my bro Ioane sometimes, that’s all OK. I can’t translate the “Pai” and “Mai” though. That gives it the essence. Even though my brother would have to guess the way the conversation will go – but that’s just because it’s me – he would precisely know this is not to be taken lightly and treat it accordingly. The best translation that I can think of is: “ Now, you Ioane”. Again, what a mess. Nope, skip that!\n\nNot to be morbid but “doliu” came up, and in Romanian language it means when somebody dies and you are in mourning. But it doesn’t at all refer to your crying or the burring or any rituals. In my family that meant that someone passed away and that you were not allowed to attend any fun functions (this including weddings), you wore black from head to toe and you were respecting the one that passed with a somber attitude. Especially outside your home. It also meant that you kept this up for a year (I think only old ladies carried this on for a year.) And again, “doliu” is only for women. How very convenient, now that I think of it! Now you will ask why on earth would somebody associate that with love and love poems. I hear you. But the “doliu” is the description of how your heart feels when you lost your love. How insanely paradoxical and beautiful is the pain of the heart described in the Romanian language?\n\nThat brings me to this question. If the words don’t even translate well from one language to another, how do you possibly – as someone that doesn’t get to speak their mother’s tongue all that often – translate ones heart and inner thoughts without the danger of being misunderstood?\n\n‘Till then, then!"
