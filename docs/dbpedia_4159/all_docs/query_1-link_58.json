        "text": "Born out of the artist's need and desire to share his favorite poems with his public, in his original interpretation, the show will add new layers of meaning to well-known Romanian texts from Nichita Stanescu, Emil Brumaru, George Toparceanu, Marin Sorescu, Spiridon Popescu or Adrian Paunescu. Alongside poetry, the artist will sprinkle his performance with music, theater and lots of improvisation.We invite you to experience a powerful performance full of subtleties, love, humor, contradictory feelings, hope and laughter. It is a show that, as the artist confesses, \"is not only about me, but it's about you, too.\" This performance will be in Romanian."
