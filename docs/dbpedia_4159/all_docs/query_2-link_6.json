How can we pave new pathways for success beyond current/antiquated worldviews and logics? More than 50 of you from across the African continent and beyond joined in on our eLearning Africa 2024 pre-conference futures dive, a collaborative initiative of ITCILO and International Labour Organization with the support of PANTOPICON. After a solid kick-off by Mr. Yves N. Iradukunda, PMP - Permanent Secretary at the government of Rwanda‚Äôs Ministry of ICT and Innovation - four future worlds were opened up to be explored throughout the day: from the nature-centric bioregional world of Alkebulan and the world of Digitabeher where digital tribes shape resilience in a fractured world, across Oklo in which African corporations fuel the continent‚Äôs net-energy exporting & brain-gaining activities, to Umugabekazi, a female-led, inclusive, community driven and long term oriented Africa. It was a marvel to witness how Africa-centric narratives were embraced and catalyzed energy-levels and entrepreneurial eagerness throughout the room. Several seeds for future-inspired strategic perspectives and instruments were brought to the fore. Thank you so much to all participants for the wonderful conversations we had and thought provoking ideas exchanged! #Rwanda, you were a blast! Special thanks also to Tom Wambeke, Delphine Dall'Agata, Alice Vozza, Fatima Elsanousi Sirelkhatim, Lisa Vandevoorde.\n\nJoin The Learning Battle with Tom Wambeke and Aline Gahongayire!

In late 2021 Laura Eigbrecht and me started to think about how cool it would be to bring together the best projects and most visionary minds working on #FutureSkills around the globe. People like Andreas Schleicher, Tom Wambeke, Angela Duckworth and many many more (just see the list below and in comments). Our ambition back then was to find 3 - 5 visionary future skills minds or projects from all continents around the globe and bring them together in a network and a collection of stories. The file carried the internal label \"The Global Future Skills Project\" and its ambition was to find exemplary programs in the field of Future Skills in higher education. We wanted to cover approaches from all six continents and elicit ground-breaking and visionary future education programs. Now - as of today - and after a long and rich journey involving wonderfull connections to people all around the globe, lots of hard work and rewarding encounters we can today say: Thank you! It is accomplished. Today we are ready to share with you the final publication. Open Access for all to read. What you will discover in there - have a look! Within the next days and weeks we will share some insights and highlights of the collection, all special pieces of this gallery of inspiration. For today let us share the first and most profound insight: It is about finding a suitable title for the book. After reading through all contributions it became clear to us... There can only be one titel: \"Creating the University of the Future!\" And that is how it is called... fresh off the press (as they used to say when they still printed books...) https://lnkd.in/ecMvQ9M9 Next Education. Creating tomorrow. www.next-education.org Thank you to...
