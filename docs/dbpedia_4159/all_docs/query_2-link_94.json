        "text": "Independent show hosted by the National Theatre in Bucharest. The responsibility for the quality and content of this event lies solely with the organizer!\n\nȘtefan Hrușcă features a national Christmas carols tour after 3 years of absence\n\nAfter a 3-year break, Romanian winter songs and traditional Christmas carols will once again reach the heart of the audience through the unmistakable voice of Ștefan Hrușcă. With his warm style and enveloping vocal timbre, the singer-songwriter who was born in Maramureș will perform „Florile dalbe”, „Steaua”, „Trei păstori”, „Afară ninge liniștit”, „Linu-i lin” and many other songs without which the winter holidays would not be complete. There will also be songs from the Cenaclul Flacăra, including the incredible „Rugă pentru părinți” with lyrics by Adrian Păunescu.\n\nAlways sung with the same sensitivity, the Christmas carols collected and brought to us as a gift by Ștefan Hrușcă retain their authenticity. So, welcome these carols and enjoy a concert that honors this Romanian tradition in its most sincere and pure form.\n\nȘtefan Hrușcă was born on December 8, 1957 in Ieud, Maramureș, and is one of the most appreciated Romanian folk singers. He made his debut in 1981 at Cenaclul Flacăra, where he appeared in over 1000 performances, but he has definitely conquered the public with his superb Christmas carols that he interprets like no other. Since 1991 he has been based in Toronto, Canada, but year after year he carries on the tradition, returning to Romania for a series of Christmas concerts."
