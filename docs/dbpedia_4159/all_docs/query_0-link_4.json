Iliescu conceded defeat soon after the polls closed.[3] Constantinescu took office on 29 November, marking the first peaceful transfer of power since the fall of communism. To date, it is the only time since the introduction of direct presidential elections that an incumbent Romanian president has been defeated when running for re-election. The 1996 Romanian presidential election was the third of its kind held in post-1989 Romania.\n\nThe CDR, a broad coalition of parties opposing the governing centre-left PDSR, also emerged as the largest bloc in Parliament, winning 122 of the 343 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 53 of the 143 seats in the Senate.\n\nName Lifespan Public Administration Experience Affiliation and endorsements Alma mater and profession Candidacy\n\nAnnouncement dates\n\nEmil Constantinescu Born: 19 November 1939\n\n(age 56)\n\nTighina (de jure, Republic of Moldova;
