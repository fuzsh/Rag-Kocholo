        "text": "Discussion\n\nPosttranslational histone modifications, DNA methylation patterns, and populations of small noncoding RNAs in sperm have been implicated in the transgenerational transmission of paternal experience, with changes in these epigenetic marks observed following male exposure to such diverse stimuli as stress, malnutrition, and drugs of abuse (11 –21). In particular, the role of sperm RNA as a mechanistic link between paternal experience and its consequences on offspring behavior and physiology has been emphasized by recent studies that characterize offspring phenotypes following in vitro fertilization and/or the experimental manipulation of total sperm RNA content (12, 20). In our model of paternal stress, a reduced HPA axis response in offspring was associated with the increased expression of nine miRs (miR-29c, miR-30a, miR-30c, miR-32, miR-193-5p, miR-204, miR-375, miR-5323p, and miR-698) in paternal sperm following chronic stress exposure (11). In the current study, to confirm causality of these miR changes in offspring neurodevelopmental programming, the nine miRs (multi-miR injection) were microinjected into single-cell zygotes. Two components were critical to control for in these experiments to ensure outcomes were clearly interpreted: (i) the injection process itself, and (ii) the increased overall miR concentration, which could overwhelm and inhibit the endogenous activity of the zygote RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (33). Therefore, control injection conditions included a PBS injection to control for the zygote injection process itself, and a single-miR injection (randomly selected from one of the nine used in the composite) at the same overall concentration to control for miR concentration effects.\n\nRemarkably, and important for our understanding of paternal RNA involvement in postfertilization development, the multi-miR injection produced a phenotype nearly identical to that of our paternal stress model, where both male and female mice from the multi-miR injections mounted a significantly blunted corticosterone response to an acute restraint stress as adults. A striking overlap was observed in the magnitude of effect on corticosterone production and its rate of rise and of recovery between multi-miR–injected animals and our previously reported paternal stress offspring (as shown in the schematic in ). The corticosterone response curve elicited by an acute stressor is multifaceted, with aspects of the curve (e.g., baseline, maximal rise, and rates of rise and recovery) regulated by specific brain regions, including the PVN, thalamus, and hippocampus (34). Thus, parallels in the shape of the corticosterone curves between this study and our paternal stress model emphasize similarities in programming mechanisms elicited by paternal sperm miRs. The single-miR injection did not affect the HPA axis corticosterone levels, suggesting that the specific and combinatorial activity of these sperm miRs alters stress axis responsivity. Certainly, as we did not examine each miR independently or in all possible combinations to determine the minimal complement necessary to produce the effect, future studies will need to examine the contribution of each of the nine miRs. Additionally, although expected sex differences in corticosterone levels were observed, sex did not interact to impact miR programming of stress responsivity. Further, similar to what we reported following paternal stress exposure, the expression of offspring stress-regulatory genes in the pituitary (CRF receptor-1 and proopiomelanocortin) and adrenal glands (melanocortin receptor-2 and 11βHSD-1) were unaffected in the zygote multi-miR–injected mice as adults. However, the interaction of zygote miR injection with sex on adrenal Mc2r expression suggests that miR reprogramming of the HPA axis may involve a convergent sex difference, whereas the endpoint effect on the HPA is ultimately the same (35).\n\nIn examination of the long-term changes in neurodevelopmental programming in the multi-miR–injected mice, we completed RNA-seq analysis on micropunches from the adult PVN, the hypothalamic regulator of the HPA stress axis. GSEA of the PVN transcriptome revealed a robust enrichment of extracellular matrix and collagen formation gene sets in control animals, reflecting a decreased expression of these genes in the PVN of the multi-miR–injected group. Functional annotation clustering of differentially expressed genes using DAVID tools confirmed this outcome, where affected genes primarily associated with GO terms for the extracellular matrix and collagen organization. In fact, 17 unique collagen genes were down-regulated in the multi-miR–injected group PVN compared with controls. These findings may reflect deficits in cerebral circulation and/or blood–brain barrier permeability in the PVN, effects that would have significant impact on neuroendocrine function (36, 37). Furthermore, the PVN is one of the most highly vascularized regions in the brain, suggesting that it may be particularly susceptible to developmental changes in circulation or permeability (38). This heightened plasticity of stress homeostatic mechanisms to transgenerational reprogramming could confer a selective advantage or disadvantage depending on environmental conditions.\n\nAdditionally, in examination of RNA-seq results, we noted that the majority of differentially expressed genes (288 of 298) in the PVN exhibited a dramatic decrease in expression, similar to what we reported previously in our paternal stress model and supporting the idea that an increase of these specific nine miRs in the zygote in either model (delivered through sperm in response to stress or experimentally by microinjection) can elicit long-term genetic reprogramming (11). As the overall focus of these repressed genes is in the extracellular matrix and collagen organization, this mouse model suggests that hypothalamic reprogramming governs neuroendocrine function in control of the HPA axis. Gross PVN development was not impacted by the zygote injection, as markers of the primary and dominant cell populations within the PVN were examined and did not differ between control and multi-miR–injected groups. Instead, this robust suppression of the transcriptome may suggest regulation by an upstream epigenetic mechanism, such as a histone repressive mark. The programming of such a change at the level of the brain is likely a complex and multifaceted process, whereby miRs initiate a cascade of molecular events at fertilization that, through many steps, impact regulatory mechanisms such as chromatin modifications or DNA methylation to eventually alter neurodevelopment and related behaviors or physiology (9). As we would predict, we found that the expression of the nine specific sperm miRs was unchanged in the adult PVN. Ultimately, stepwise investigation of the complex cascade by which a germ cell mark, such as sperm miRs, can impart changes in the developing offspring is critical to our understanding of the transgenerational transmission of paternal experiences, and must begin with an investigation of its activity immediately following fertilization in the single-cell zygote.\n\nDuring normal embryogenesis, stores of maternal mRNA initially present in the zygote are selectively degraded postfertilization, and miR function within the zygote RISC complex is essential to this developmental process (39, 40). As this regulatory role has previously only been attributed to maternally derived miRs present in the oocyte, and as a postfertilization function of paternally derived miRs has not been established, we examined the ability of these nine paternally derived sperm miRs to impact stores of maternal mRNA. To do so, injected zygotes were cultured to the one- to two-cell stage, and the mRNA within each individual zygote was then amplified to examine differences in expression. The specific mRNAs examined were selected as being both present in published lists of the transcriptome in mouse late-stage oocytes and/or single-cell zygotes and predicted targets of one or more of the nine sperm miRs in the miRWalk database (30 –32). Impressively, the pattern of candidate maternal mRNAs expression in single-cell zygotes was overall reduced in the multi-miR–injected group, supporting our hypothesized function that sperm miRs selectively target maternal mRNA leading to the posttranscriptional silencing of expression. Further, eight of the candidate mRNA—Sirt1, Ube3a, Srsf2, IL6st, Ncl, Aars, Agfg1, and Ralbp1—were dramatically affected by the multi-miR zygote injection, with expression levels reduced to between a half and a quarter of control levels. Importantly, the known developmental functions of the targeted genes, including the notable involvement of Ube3a and Sirt1 in chromatin remodeling and neurodevelopmental disorders (41, 42), support the hypothesis that sperm miRs may initiate lasting, programmatic changes that ultimately impact neurodevelopment and stress reactivity of the developing embryo. Again, as the single-miR injection did not affect the expression of stored maternal mRNA, the reduction in mRNA levels appears related to the specific composite activity of the nine miRs and not simply to changes in overall miR concentration. Future studies will need to determine how the targeted reduction in stored maternal mRNAs by paternal sperm miRs can induce reprogramming of the hypothalamus, but these findings certainly suggest an important influence of the paternal epigenome on early zygote development, a process previously considered maternally driven."
