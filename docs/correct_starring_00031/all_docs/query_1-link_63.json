        "text": "\"Camp Rock\" Takes Kids' Music to New Heights\n\nBy Ed Martin TV / Video Download Archives\n\nJackMyers teen correspondent Maya Motavalli attended last week’s gala premiere of the Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock at the world-famous Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City.\n\n“The event was amazing, as every Disney event is,” Maya exclaims. “But the movie was even better!” This is her review:\n\nTake one part Jonas Brothers and one part Demi Lovato, add a pinch of favorite Disney Channel stars (Alyson Stoner, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody; Maria Canals-Barrera, Wizards of Waverly Place; Jasmine Richards, Naturally Sadie), stir them all together with a gallon of great music and you’ve got Camp Rock, a hit for Disney Channel even before it premieres.\n\nCamp Rock proves once again that the thing Disney does best is make musicals. It has a much different sound than the High School Musical movies and it takes kids’ music to new heights. The best song is Gotta Find You, which Joe Jonas sings solo after his character hears Demi’s character singing but does not see her. I love the lyrics, the beat is great, and as with all Jonas Brothers songs, I always see Joe singing the song just to me. He’s totally hot. What else could a girl want?\n\nI also love Demi Lovato’s song, This is Me, which she performs with Joe. It’s a great song about coming out, telling the world, ‘This is who I am, and I’m not afraid to be me!’ Demi’s got a great voice, and after she opens for the Jo Bros on their next tour there’s no doubt she’s going to go far. Other songs such as the upbeat movie theme song We Rock, as well as Too Cool and Start the Party, are also great listens and really make this movie a lot of fun.\n\nThe actual story of Camp Rock isn’t really that special. We’ve all seen it a thousand times before: A girl finds herself, finds a guy and they live happily ever after. Well, I may have heard it before, but I never get tired of it, especially when it’s told with my favorite band.\n\nThis is another Disney movie with a really strong message: In this case it’s “Don’t fit in. Stand out!” Most kids only focus on doing whatever it takes to be popular. It’s a great message for all kids to follow – including me.\n\nStaring into my crystal ball, I see that Camp Rock is going to be a huge hit. A rock-out-loud CD of amazing songs, dancing that kicks butt, a dream team cast and lots of love will make it a winner. Girls will definitely want to watch it over and over again."
