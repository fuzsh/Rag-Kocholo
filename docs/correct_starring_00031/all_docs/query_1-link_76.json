Mitchie wants to go to a music camp named \"Camp Rock\". Since the family can't afford the tuition, Mitchie's mother arranges to cater food for the camp, thus allowing Mitchie to attend. Mitchie tries to conceal this from her friends at camp. She is shy to sing in front of people.\n\nSpoiled brat/pop star Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) has been assigned to be in charge of dance classes for one month at Camp Rock by his bandmates Jason (Kevin Jonas) and Nate (Nick Jonas). Shane hears Mitchie singing and falls in love with the voice, but does not know the identity of the singer. Shane spends much of the film searching for the girl with the voice. Shane and Mitchie have various interactions, and, when Shane learns her identity, a romance between the two blossoms.\n\nCharacters and cast\n\n* Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) is a girl who hopes to be a singer some day. Her dream is to go to Camp Rock, but her family cannot afford the expensive camp. The only way she could go was if her mother would be the cook, and she tries to hide that fact in fear of rejection.\n\n* Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) is the famous lead singer of the band \"Connect 3\". He is sent to Camp Rock, in hopes that it would help him, and get rid of his cocky and arrogant attitude. At the camp, he hears a terrific voice, and spends most of his time trying to find the girl who sang (who is really Mitchie.) Later, he meets Mitchie and they become friends, yet he doesn't know it is the girl with the voice. He eventually finds out she is the girl with the voice towards the end of the film.\n\n* Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin) is the daughter of the famous T.J. Tyler, and one day wishes to be a singer, like her mother. She is a diva and often gets her way, even if she has to hurt people. She craves attention and is always hoping to impress Shane; the reason for her behavior is because her mother was often too busy with her career to care for or even pay attention to her. Upon meeting Mitchie, Tess immediately sees her as competition and makes several plots to get her out of the way, ranging from casting Mitchie as a backup singer in her group to framing her for the theft of Tess's charm bracelet. However, during the Final Jam, Tess receives poetic justice when she trips upon seeing her mother distracted by a cell phone call; thinking about what she has done, Tess subsequently congratulates Peggy for winning the Final Jam and personally apologizes to Mitchie for her actions.\n\n* Caitlyn Gellar (Alyson Stoner) is Mitchie's best friend at camp, and is one of the few people who stick by her side when Tess reveals Mitchie's secret. She wants to be a music producer, and is often seen composing music on her laptop.\n\n* Ella Pador (Anna Maria Perez de Tagl√©) is Tess' so-called friend and is a little air-headed. Ella abandons Tess when she pushes her too far and instead sings with Barron and Sander at Final Jam, revealing herself to be a good singer.\n\n* Peggy Warburton (Margaret Dupree) (Jasmine Richards) is Tess' other \"friend\", and often follows Tess, even when her own opinion is different. In the end, she finally rebels, and sings on her own at Final Jam, winning the contest, and surprising everyone with her voice.\n\n* Connie Torres (Maria Canals Barrera) is Mitchie's mom, and also runs a family catering service called \"Connie's Catering.\" Mitchie was, at first, embarrassed that her mother was the Camp Cook.\n\n* Barron James (Jordan Francis) and Sander Lawer (Roshon Fegan) are break-dancers, and are best friends. They also rap, and sang at Final Jam with Ella. They are of the few that stayed on Mitchie's side.\n\n* Lola Scott (Aaryn Doyle) is a singer, and sometimes raps.
