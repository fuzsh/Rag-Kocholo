        "text": "Secrets of Valhalla by Jasmine Richards.\n\nHarper, HarperCollins, New York, 2016.\n\nMG fantasy, 312 pages + excerpt.\n\nLexile: 690L .\n\nAR Level: 4.9 (worth 10.0 points) .\n\nIt’s yet another unpleasant Friday the 13th for Buzz, getting bullied by Theo, trying to hang out with his best friend Sam, and meeting a new kid, American Mary, thanks to his sister. But when Buzz and Mary find a famous missing weatherwoman magically tied to a tree in the woods, they tumble in to a Norse god adventure with portals and time loops, talking squirrels and ancient runes. Oh, and the end of their world as they know it, of course.\n\nThere are some diverse MG fantasy books that have been on my radar for a while, but are just too new or old, either too far out of print for me to easily get, or so recently released that they are only available in hardcover and have a long list of library holds. If there’s one I haven’t even heard of, usually it’s not a good fit because neither the main characters nor the author are diverse or if they are, the book isn’t that great and I don’t feel comfortable recommending it.\n\nSo, when I discover a new-to-me series by a Black British author of diverse MG fantasy and get the first book and it’s perfectly written, I am beyond excited! Not only do I get to recommend Jasmine Richards to all of you, I also have two more books by her to read (and hopefully more if she continues to write).\n\nWhen I was trying to find information on Secrets of Valhalla, it was frequently compared to Percy Jackson, but this didn’t feel as Riordan-ish as some of the books from the Riordan Presents series. The action in this was more regulated, and the plot felt much less predictable and formulaic. It was often hard to guess what might possibly happen next, although it did eventually all make sense in the end. Buzz’s best friend is British Indian and new girl Mary (short for Amaryllis) is Black, but the clues on that are fairly subtly woven in.\n\nMost every MG fantasy novel will try to say each protagonist is not the typical hero, but Buzz truly isn’t. In some fantasy novels magic is either a normal part of the world or an established part of the protagonist’s family history – this is one where the magic comes as a surprise, and Buzz doesn’t take it well.\n\nSome magical kids are like Aru Shah, nerds who have been dreaming that fantasy was real all their lives. Buzz is a soccer nerd, mythology hater, and practical person. He tries to call 911 on the magical villain, is so insistent that adults get involved that they check him for brain damage, and reluctantly joins the quest to save the world only after it’s made abundantly clear that there aren’t any other choices.\n\nAll of that makes this a great choice for boys who think mythology is kind of stupid, would rather be playing sports, and have to read a fantasy book for their genre assignment in school.\n\nThe story breaks down into three major sections: the world tree, the runes, and the sleepers (who have a norse god hidden within them). Besides the magical plotlines, there are also some domestic issues – Buzz’s botanist mother has been lost in South America for some time, and he doesn’t get along with his father, who he feels emotionally abandoned the family for his obsession with mythology. At school a notorious bully loves to pick on Buzz, and his older sister’s overprotectiveness is actually making things worse. Given that his father is a famous professor, teachers are understandably frustrated when Buzz doesn’t know the most basic mythology and refuses to do assignments on the topic.\n\nI have to admit the title didn’t do a great job conveying the story, but also I imagine there are so many books on Norse mythology that it was probably difficult to come up with one that wasn’t already being used. Oh, and this doesn’t just cover Norse mythology; it also touches on a few of the Roman gods and even mentions their Greek origins.\n\nParents and teachers should be aware that this book includes bullying, neglectful parenting, family separation, loss of a parent, loss of a sibling, mention of involuntary hospitalization and other forms of forceful detention, kidnapping, depression and other mental illness, digestion by a giant worm and probably a few other things I’ve forgotten. There was some peril and several hero-threatening situations, but it always stayed MG-appropriate in my opinion, and most of the more dire situations were either quick or occurred offscreen.\n\nI am thrilled to be able to recommend this book, and look forward to getting and reading the sequel and Richards’ other standalone fantasy!"
