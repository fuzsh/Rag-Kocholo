        "text": "The basic summer camp wardrobe of shorts and T-shirts hasn’t changed much over the years. But this summer, campers might need to leave a little room in their trunks for moccasin boots, skinny jeans (for girls and boys) and chunky jewelry.\n\nConsider it the “Camp Rock” effect.\n\n“Camp Rock” is Disney Channel’s TV movie released in June starring the in-demand Jonas Brothers. It’s now playing on the Disney channel and Family channel. (See listings for air time.)\n\nIt could be this year’s “High School Musical,” and any parent of a “tween” – or toddler – knows how much that movie influenced fashion over the past few years.\n\nThe cabins, lake and woodsy setting of Camp Rock is like many real-life summer getaways, but the campers are all aspiring rock stars and they travel with a flashier wardrobe.\n\nThe exception is Demi Lovato’s character Mitchie Torres, a talented musician with humble roots and wardrobe to match. Alyson Stoner is her pal Caitlyn Geller, whose style is best described as ” ’80s wannabe.”\n\nIn real life, 15-year-old Demi is a little more high-maintenance. She cringes when she thinks of the clothes she took to camp back in the sixth grade: seven pairs of shorts and seven T-shirts.\n\n“Now I’d pack 30 shirts and 30 shoes,” she says. “I’d need a separate suitcase for shoes and leggings.”\n\nShe’s a fan of hats, Ray-Ban sunglasses and “crazy-color jeans, especially high-waisted ones.” She adds: “I’m not a basic black girl, and you’ll never catch me in sweats.”\n\nMeanwhile, Alyson, 14, would tone down Caitlyn’s extreme clothes, a style she describes as “Madonna meets Hot Topic.” But she did enjoy wearing the bold styles, such as brightly colored leg warmers and graphic wristbands, on the set.\n\n“Once I got it on, I thought I wanted to steal it all from Caitlyn, but then I’d get home and do a reality check.”\n\nIf you’re worried about sending kids to camp with leg-warmers and fedoras, at least you can relax about the beauty routine.\n\n“Sometimes it didn’t look like we were wearing makeup at all – I liked that,” Demi says. “It looked natural. I didn’t want people to think, ‘Well, she goes to camp wearing a full face of makeup, so I will too.’ “"
