Peel is not known to have played Tommy Boy's landmark breakthrough record, 'Planet Rock' by Afrika Bambaataa & The Soul Sonic Force, which was released in 1982, but he did give airtime to numerous other releases on the label, particularly those of De La Soul, Queen Latifah, Paris and Stetsasonic, reflecting his continuing interest in Hip Hop into the 1990s.

Before playing the Tommy Boy release 'The Payoff Mix' by Double Dee & Steinski in the 1987 Peeling Back The Years series, he described what he enjoyed about it:

"With hip-hop, there are so many elements brought into play and brought in from such random points - I mean, like just sampled speech and sampled rhythms and sampled bits of guitar and so on. I mean, there’s just so much going on there’s almost too much happening in a lot of the records, where you have to listen to them quite carefully, quite a lot, in order to identify everything that’s going on."[1]

The first Tommy Boy release known to have been played by Peel was 'No Sell Out', credited to black activist Malcolm X, which marked one of the first uses of sample-based composition in popular music. The record was put together by drummer Keith LeBlanc, who subsequently featured regularly on the DJ's shows as part of Tackhead and other projects of UK dub producer Adrian Sherwood.
