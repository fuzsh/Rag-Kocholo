        "text": "Melbourne on the Mississippi Festival w/ Lothario, Alien Nosejob, Felchers, Citric Dummies, Science Man, Cruelster, the Haddonfields, DJ Martin Meyer\n\n5 p.m. Friday, October 6. South Broadway Athletic Club, 2301 South Seventh Street. $25. 314-776-4833.\n\nIf a critic were tasked with describing what the music of Citric Dummies sounds like, they might be tempted to say something like, \"The band takes the reverb-drenched approach of the Spits, all blazing-fast 16th-note beats and tight musicianship, and combines it with the impossibly catchy melodies and irreverent approach of the Dickies, while throwing in some Devo-style weirdness just for good measure.\" But in so doing, said critic would have revealed himself to be a stupid fat moron, as the Minneapolis three-piece made abundantly clear on opening track \"We Don't Care Who We Sound Like\" from 2018's The Kids Are Alt-Right. To wit: \"People tell us that we sound like the Spits / We don't care / People tell us that we sound like the Dickies / We don't care / People tell us that we sound like Devo / We don't care / People tell us that we sound like shit / We don't care.\" So rather than make that kind of blunder, we'll just note that since its first release in 2016 the group has been a fount of hysterically entertaining, razor-sharp and precisely executed punk delivered with a no-fucks-to-give attitude and a level of infectiousness that would make a global pandemic jealous. The band's newest offering, Zen and the Arcade of Beating Your Ass, is set for release November 3, and sees the Dummies taking the sound it's long since perfected and claiming it wholly as their own. Meaning that in the future, hack music writers won't need to resort to name-checking other groups — they can just say, \"It sounds like Citric Dummies.\"\n\nIt's an Invasion: Citric Dummies is just one of many excellent out-of-town acts performing as part of the Melbourne on the Mississippi Festival — Australian groups Alien Nosejob and Lothario, Kentucky's Felchers, New York's Science Man and Ohio's Cruelster will also be gracing our fine town with their presence. Fans of punk that is more egg than chain will find plenty to enjoy.\n\nSZA\n\n8 p.m. Wednesday, October 11. Enterprise Center, 1401 Clark Avenue. $36.50 to $196.50. 314-621-8811.\n\nIt's been years since St. Louis native SZA performed in the town of her birth, and a lot has changed. Most notably, unlike her last appearance in 2017, there is no chance in hell you can expect to see her performing in a venue the size of the Ready Room ever again — she is now a talent that can only be contained within an arena. The Top Dawg Records-affiliated artist is so unparalleled, in fact, that even a relatively long period of silence and record delays — reportedly the result of disagreements with her label — could do nothing to slow her ascent. When SOS finally dropped in December 2022, some five years after her previous album, ctrl, it landed with a massive thud, earning widespread critical acclaim and debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, where it stayed for seven weeks — a feat that hadn't been achieved by an R&B album since Whitney Houston's Whitney in 1987. SZA reportedly wrote more than 100 songs leading up to the album's release, and its wide variety of sounds and spliced genres assure that it will have considerable staying power and replayability in the years to come. It also proved decisively that some things are simply worth the wait.\n\nSpeaking of Waiting: Though SOS sees its star clad in a Blues jersey on its cover, St. Louis initially was not one of the cities that was included when news of this latest tour was announced in February. That was rectified with an additional set of dates that were added in April, much to local fans' delight. THURSDAY 5\n\nAndy Coco's NOLA Funk and R&B Revue: 9 p.m., $12. Broadway Oyster Bar, 736 S.
