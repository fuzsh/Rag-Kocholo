        "meta_description": "Renegades Of Jazz Remixes by Brownout | Jungle Fire, released 04 February 2021\n\n1. Brownout - Flaximus (Renegades Of Jazz Bboy Edit)\n2. Jungle Fire - Comencemos (Renegades Of Jazz Remix)\n\nThis record features two remixes by German DJ and producer &quot;David Hanke&quot; aka &quot;Renegades Of Jazz&quot;, for Afro-latin Funk bands &quot;Brownout&quot; and &quot;Jungle Fire&quot;. Brownout&#39;s remix was first released in 2013 via Paris DJs on a very limited run of 45s and quickly became very sought after. By painstakingly cutting every instrument&#39;s individual notes, increasing the tempo and adding in a punchy breakbeat at the end, David turned &quot;Flaximus&quot; into an up-tempo dancefloor hit. \r\n\r\nJungle Fire&#39;s song &quot;Comencemos&quot; that appears on the B side is a cover version of Fela Ransome-Kuti&#39;s song &quot;Let&#39;s Start&quot;.David added some more Afrofunk elements to the Jungle Fire version and builds a bridge to the original Fela version with the additional elements. The Jungle Fire remix is previously unreleased and available for the first time. \r\n\r\nNine-piece band &quot;Brownout&quot; from Austin/Texas, was formed in 2005 by members of the Grammy Award-winning Latin orchestra &quot;Grupo Fantasma&quot; and have since become a musical force of their own. In addition to three Austin Music Awards, the band has performed at countless events and festivals and has regularly toured the U.S. also as highly sought-after backing band for artists like Prince, GZA and many more. Their albums and singles have been released on labels like &quot;Freestyle Records&quot;, &quot;Ubiquity&quot; or &quot;Fat Beats&quot;. \r\n\r\n&quot;Jungle Fire&quot; is an Afrolatin Funk band from Los Angeles known for their authentic and highly explosive sound. They quickly gained attention of the local Los Angeles scene and beyond, which led to their first release on the Funk and Soul label &quot;Colemine&quot;. Other releases have been released on &quot;Nacional Records&quot;, &quot;Paris DJs&quot; and &quot;Razor N Tape&quot;. Their second album &quot;Jambú&quot; debuted at #4 on the Billboard Latin charts in February 2017 which led to numerous features in several movies, commercials and TV shows. They create a unique Afro-Tropical sound by combining West African rhythms with heavy funk elements.",
