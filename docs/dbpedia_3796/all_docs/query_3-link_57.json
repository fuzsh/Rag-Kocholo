        "text": "From American funk to Hungarian post-punk to labels like Sound Way and Sublime Frequencies, we live in a golden age for the unearthing of great, unheard music. Here's a roundup of some of the best recently released but rarely talked-about compilations.\n\nVarious Artists:\n\nFunkytown Budapest\n\n[Blek]\n\nThis looks like a trap, and I bought it expecting to be sorely let down. I mean, consider the subtitle: \"First Hungarian Funk Compilation from the 70s.\" It sounds like the kind of thing someone would make up to poke fun at people like me who buy this stuff without having any idea what we're getting into. But anyway, it's fucking great-- even it doesn't have any liner notes.\n\nWhile communism made for a largely dreary existence in Hungary and the rest of the Warsaw Pact bloc, there was still apparently room for some seriously funky shit behind the Iron Curtain. Hungarian folk music is extremely rhythmic and frequently works in odd meters (7/4 in particular) and you can hear a bit of that as bands like Locomotiv GT and Skorpio throw down one sick groove after another. Bergendy's \"Turning Off My Nervous\" morphs from what sounds almost like a field recording into a deep funk 'n' soul workout spiked with hot horns and frenetic Rhodes, Deseo Csaba's \"Funky Violin\" lives up to its title, and General's \"Pull out a Disc!\" is five minutes of some of the sickest funk you've never heard in your life.\n\nMahmoud Ahmed:\n\nEthiopiques 19: Alemye\n\n[Buda Musique]\n\nFor a series that was originally supposed to be about 10 volumes, Francis Falceto's Ethiopiques has grown awfully large, but nearly every minute of music he's unearthed has been worth it. Towering over the set with three dedicated volumes (a fourth is in the offing down the road) is Mahmoud Ahmed, the biggest star of Swinging Addis and a man with a voice powerful enough to strip paint.\n\nAlemye is a collection of his 1974 recordings for Addis-based Ahma Records and the sound is nearly impossible to describe-- suffice to say that the traditional Ethiopian pentatonic scale and American soul & funk make for one of the greatest musical combinations of the 20th century. The Ibex Band creates a swirling, psychedelic backdrop built around cycling, hypnotic bass lines and topped with a unique sax/flute tandem, sometimes replaced by stabbing dual saxes. Ahmed's masterpiece is \"Ere Mela Mela\" (available on Ethiopiques 7), but Alemye is worth owning for any fan of Ethiopian pop's Golden Era-- the 12-minute version of \"Tezeta\" alone practically demands it.\n\nCymande:\n\nRenegades of Funk\n\n[NHR1]\n\nOsibisa:\n\nOsibisa/Woyaya\n\n[BGO]\n\nI'm pairing these two up because the bands have such similar backgrounds-- both were comprised of British immigrants. Cymande were from the West Indies, Osibisa were from the West Indies and Ghana-- and both were funky bands who stressed a positive message. Heck, Osibisa even translates to \"criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness.\" Osibisa's Roger Dean cover art betrayed them as the trippier of the two bands, though they could settle into a serious Afrobeat groove at will, as they do on \"Music for Gong Gong\" on their self-titled record.\n\nWhile they were given to jamming and the occasional fluffy hippie passage, Cymande were all about the streamlined, super-sleek funk. Renegades of Funk pulls together cuts from all three of their albums, and fronts the monster floor tracks \"Bra\", \"Brothers on the Slide\", and \"The Message\", all of which positively kill. Cymande are one of those bands who have seemed due for a resurrection for years, but aside from the occasional sample, their albums remain out of print, leaving this nicely remastered comp as the only place to hear them on CD.\n\nT.P. Orchestre Poly-Rhythmo:\n\nKings of Benin Urban Groove 1972-80\n\n[Sound Way]\n\nT.P. Orchestre Poly-Rhythmo played just about everything over the course of their insanely prolific recording career, cutting everything from traditional guitar highlife to hard funk. The common thread in all of their music, though, is groove-- everything they did rides a rhythm. Yehoussi Leopold is a nasty drummer and the band wraps around him tightly, horns stabbing at bobbing bass while guitars snake through the mix in a tangled interplay. Sound Way sampled these 13 tracks from across the band's sprawling discography, focusing on the band's best Afrobeat and funk tracks for a rock-solid collection of one of Africa's best and most overlooked bands.\n\nEgg:\n\nThe Polite Force\n\n[Eclectic Discs]\n\nCanterbury prog is sort of a love-it-or-hate-it proposition, but if you love it, you need this 1971 record by one of the scene's seminal bands. Tons of long, winding passages of psychedelic guitar and bombastic, spacey organ mingle with surprisingly concise vocal passages to keep it accessible for people who don't totally geek out to complex meters and dissonant horns. Egg also had a way of understating the interplay and virtuosity that too many prog bands put front and center, focusing instead on developing a sort of chilled psych vibe that wears time a little better than many of their counterparts.\n\nArchie Bell & the Drells:\n\nTighten Up / I Can't Stop Dancing\n\n[Rhino]\n\nArchie Bell & the Drells are typically remembered as one-hit wonders for their fantastic 1968 slice of breezy funk \"Tighten Up\", but this two-fer reissue of their debut and sophomore albums indicates that they had a wealth of quality material. The title track from I Can't Stop Dancing is actually a slightly superior reconsideration of \"Tighten Up\", but it's not just the singles that stand out. Album cuts like the sweet Philly soul track \"I Don't Wanna Be a Playboy\", the draftee's lament \"A Soldier's Prayer, 1967\", and even the questionably named \"Monkey Time\" all point to a band with more than enough smooth sophistication and funky grit to have been huge. Unfortunately, Bell was overseas with the Army when the band hit the charts, leaving them unable to capitalize on their success.\n\nThe Propositions:\n\nFunky Disposition: the Complete Propositions Collection\n\n[Luv 'n' Haight/Ubiquity]\n\nThe Propositions were a Detroit funk band that released three singles and only ever achieved marginal, regional popularity, but there's a good story and even more good music here. For one thing, the band were known for most of their existence as the Prepositions, somewhat ironic when you consider that a band named for a part of speech accidentally had their name changed by a typo in a record pressing of their third and final single, \"Africana\". This mostly instrumental set is full of sweaty horn lines and thumping grooves and about the only complaint you could make is that it occasionally falls into a passage that sounds more like a backing track than the main event. Still, it's two discs of heavy funk for the price of one and an interesting glimpse at the Motor City scene that operated in Motown's shadow.\n\nVarious Artists:\n\nGolden Afrique, Vol. 1\n\n[Network]\n\nI tend to gravitate to Afropop compilaitons that hew toward the Afrobeat, funk, and rock end of the spectrum, but every now and then I come across a compilation of generally more traditional stuff that illuminates just how diverse the other local styles like highlife and mbalax were. These two discs draw tracks from across West Africa with a focus on those and other Cuban-influenced West African sounds, like those of the Malian hotel bands. Several big names appear, such as Mali's seminal Rail Band, Gambia's Super Eagles, here in their Afro-Cuban ndangga guise, Miriam Makeba, during her exile from South Africa spent in Guinea, and the dual giants of Senegal, Orchestra Baobab and Etoile de Dakar, the band that launched the career of Youssou N'Dour.\n\nThe best track for my money, though, is also one of the most obscure, by a Gambian band called Guelewar Band of Banjul. \"Warteef Jigeen\" grinds it Cuban rhythm in the dirt and busts out with a totally unexpected monophonic synthesizer solo almost five minutes in-- not that the rough horn arrangement wouldn't have been enough on its own. It's not the first thing I'd recommend to an American rock or soul fan looking to get into African popular music, but it's certainly one of the best Afro-Cuban-focused afropop compilations I've heard.\n\nVarious Artists:\n\nBrazilian Beats 6\n\n[Mr. Bongo]\n\nAs the title makes clear, this is the sixth in an increasingly vital series of compilations highlighting the diversity of Brazilian music. This volume swerves all over the road, from the neo-Sergio Mendes samba-pop of Golden Boys to the strange collage of motorcycles, car horns, found sound and trumpets that makes up Siri's \"No Tranco\". In between, you get a slew of great club tracks, most notably Arakatuba's \"Riva\" and the Buzzina remix of Macrelinha da Lua & Seu Jorge's \"Cotidiano\"-- as well as the bluesy soul of Som Tres, the old-time rock 'n' roll/samba hybrid of Oliviera e sus Black Boys, and Black Alien's \"Babylon by Gus\", a slinky hip-hop track that rides a classical piano sample. It's all over the map, and as a result it's also all over my stereo.\n\nVarious:\n\nRadio Sumatra\n\n[Sublime Frequencies]\n\nSpeaking of all over the map, the awesome folks at Sublime Frequencies have gone back to Sumatra and produced this strange \"field recording,\" culled entirely from Sumatran FM radio broadcasts. As such, it's not a collection of killer tracks or an overview of Sumatran & Indonesian pop-- in fact, it doesn't even specify artists or styles, instead dividing the recordings into 11 tracks and preserving as faithfully as possible the tone of modern Indonesian FM, right down to the cuts from rough pseudo-metal straight into a sugary ballad fronted by a chirpy female singer. Even better are some of the English-language stations IDs, claiming slogans like \"the most radio.\" American radio could learn a few things from the free-form madness of it all, but if there's only one thing we take away from it, I hope they're karaoke call-in shows, because it's hard to think of anything more awesome.\n\nFern Jones:\n\nThe Glory Road\n\n[Numero Group]\n\nFern Jones was a preacher's wife with rock'n'roll dreams whose one true shot at fame was spoiled by label problems and the fact that she was caught between two worlds. On the one hand, her background playing in honky-tonks as a teenager had given her music a forceful physicality, while on the other she sang an exclusively religious repertoire. In the 50s, rock'n'roll was still anathema to many conservative Christians, while most rock fans had no interest in being preached to about the gospels, leaving her essentially without an audience.\n\nOf course, what once sounded threateningly raunchy now strikes us as pretty tame, but Jones' voice, supported by crack session men fresh off backing Elvis Presley, holds up as well as any classic country singer's, sounding somewhat similar to Patsy Cline. It's an interesting recording that takes a unique look at a juncture in American popular song that's seldom explored in any depth.\n\nWarsaw Village Band:\n\nUprooting\n\n[World Village]\n\nPolish prog-folk is perhaps not the most accurate way to describe the music of the Warsaw Village Band, but it works well enough as a shorthand descriptor. Relying on traditional Eastern European folk textures, the band builds the album off of four specified \"roots\" tracks, crafting a modern sound with old war drums, hurdy gurdy, violin, xylophone, and dulcimer. The strings are tensely layered, echoing the drone of the dulcimer and hurdy gurdy while the vocalists sing in what, to our ears, could be best described as dissonant harmony, a style of harmony I've found to be unique to Eastern Europe. Uprooting is above all an intensely rhythmic album, challenging but accessible and instantly memorable.\n\nLinton Kwesi Johnson:\n\nLive in Paris With the Dennis Bovell Dub Band\n\n[Wrasse]\n\nAn ex-pat living in London, Linton Kwesi Johnson isn't your typical reggae star; he's a poet and not a singer, sort of a Jamaican Gil-Scott Heron. Nevertheless, he's been at it for a quarter-century, and this record (also available as a DVD) catches a 2003 performance at the Zenith in Paris before a very enthusiastic crowd. Johnson's delivery follows the band's sinewy reggae groove, his voice low-key but forceful enough to put his hard-hitting accounts of police brutality, street violence and anti-fascist rioting across. \"You've got to smash their brains in/ Because they ain't got nothing in them,\" he sings of fascists on \"Fite Dem Back\", a song he introduces by relating it to the War on Terror. Dennis Bovell and the other backing musicians churn out wicked, funked-up reggae and ska that makes the most of some bizarre synth settings and, naturally, a ton of delay and reverb to drive Johnson's lines home."
