        "text": "Retro Funk takes inspiration from the legends who created and pushed the music to higher grounds.\n\nThe sounds of Bootsy & P-Funk, The O’Jays, Shaft’s orchestral stylings, JB Funk grooves, Stevie Wonder, Gap Band & Tom Tom Club. Combined with the influences and grooves from classic early hip-hop breaks, opening up the vibes to a wide array of genres - it's all in here...\n\nThis pack is full of funky drumming, heaps of percussion, lush analogue synths, wah-wah guitar and basslines, phaser-shifting electric keys and layered combos, all ready to drop into your music for that added pinch of hot sauce groove.\n\nWhat makes this collection stand apart from other packs - there are loops recorded in the ‘70s, originating from 40-year-old 2\" tapes crafted by Bill King (pianist, composer, and arranger who studied with Oscar Peterson, worked with Janis Joplin, Pointer Sisters, Martha Reeves, Chaka Khan).\n\nThese vintage sounds include drums, electric keyboard, clavinet, ‘70s analogue synths, horns, and percussion. There are even recording sessions conducted in Atlanta, Georgia, at Axis Sounds in the late ‘70s. We chose several old reels of 2\" tape and baked them at 130 degrees - digitised after a single pass and transferred them to Pro Tools. From there, we cut up and picked the finest, most relevant sounds from the sessions.\n\nWe constructed the additional loops using vintage gear emulations such as EMT Plate, Capital Records Chambers, Eventide Harmonizer, phase shifters, echos, and more. We aim the bulk of the drum loops towards a funk hip-hop groove that blends into different musical styles, including reggae, dub, house, trip-hop, and many more."
