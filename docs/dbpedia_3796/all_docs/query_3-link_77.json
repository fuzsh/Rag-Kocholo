        "text": "This year promised some heavy sounds, as Judas Priest, Ace Frehley, Bruce Dickinson and Mick Mars issuing new albums.\n\nJudas Priest topped the early release schedule with Invincible Shield. There had actually been talk of leaving 2018's Firepower as the band's final album, but Rob Halford said excitement around the release ended up sparking new material. Meanwhile, The Mandrake Project finds Iron Maiden's frontman returning to solo work after previously issuing Tyranny of Souls in 2005.\n\nFrehley's 10,000 Volts is his first album of original material since 2018's Spaceman. The former Kiss star released the covers collection Origins Vol. 2 in 2020. Mars, the retired Motley Crue guitarist, will finally unveil his long-awaited debut album. He'd spent more than a decade working on Another Side of Mars.\n\nElsewhere, 2024 was set to bring new projects from Blackberry Smoke, Sheryl Crow, Green Day and Lenny Kravitz, among others. The Smile, a Radiohead offshoot band featuring Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, will also issue Wall of Eyes. This is their second LP, following 2022's A Light for Attracting Attention.\n\nAlso scheduled to arrive were key reissues from Paul McCartney and Wings, Peter Frampton and the Average White Band, with intriguing live stuff on the way from the Allman Brothers Band, Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, Rick Wakeman and the Babys.\n\nMore information on these and other pending rock albums can be found below.
