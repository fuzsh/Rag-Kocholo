Right out of the gate, the infant record label launched their first full length album, Renegades Worldwide, Global Domination, in early March, a powerful hip hop collective addressing everything from break ups, to the pandemic, to the War on Ukraine, and get this, there are 12 emcees on this album and no swearing, cussing, or potty talk, whatever you want to call it. Something truly unique in Hip Hop.\n\nFrom there, we saw the Five1Hero come onto the scene with his breakout debut single âSummer in SoCalâ, a laid-back boom bap track with a myriad of up-and-coming female vocalists. After the release of âSummer in SoCalâ we saw Fresh Cut Wax LLC., release a handful of singles from both brands, The Five1Hero and Renegades Worldwide, including the single for âOn the Runâ from Renegades and âThe Hitâ and 'A Mi Lado', a surprise down tempo song featuring the Jazzy Argentinian bombshell, Mica Franco with lyrics completely in Spanish.\n\nThen in the Fall, Fresh Cut Wax came out with a huge announcement that NorCal rock band, Young Beard, was signing up and releasing some of their music with the label and creating a new album. With that came the final release of the year, Young Beards' track The Big September remixed by the Five1Hero with a cameo from Renegade Worldwide rapper King Marino.\n\nToday, The Five1Hero, President, CEO, and Executive Producer, of the label announced that each brand is releasing a full-length album on New Yearâs Day 2023.\n\nâI am very excited for New Years Day 2023. I feel like after that day I can really focus on blowing up the label and out brands of talent. I have been in producer mode for a couple years now and really need to get our products out there. I may be biased but I truly believe the people want and need our music.â\n\nThe first album is Young Beardâs full release of The Big September, including every track they have recorded, including the remix.\n\nThe second album is Renegades Worldwideâ Global Remixes, a remix album with a lot of EDM, Dub, & Dancehall influence. âGlobal Remixes is basically a brand-new album even though it is remixes from Global Domination. They are so different and unique, and the album flows together so well, I am really excited to see what people think.â Explains âHero.\n\nThe third album is Five1Heroâs official 1st full length album entitled Sunday Brunch Playlist Volume 1 â The Blue Moon CafÃ©. âThis album is a lot of my life in my later teens and 20âs when I was in the club and rave scenes quite a bit. I am very proud of this album. I think it pays tribute to my years in San Francisco and the music I love. I wanted it to have some hip hop but not e a hip hop album, but really show a lot more musical diversity. I think we hit the nail on the head.â\n\nAll 3 albums will be for sale digitally on all major platforms for just $5.99 each. âWe really appreciate anyone who buys these albums. The way streaming services work it is almost impossible for an artist to make money these days, so we definitely appreciate the purchases!â says âHero.\n\nYou can Save and Preorder the tracks albums here:\n\nhttps://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/youngbeard/the-big-sepytember\n\nhttps://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/renegadesworldwide/global-remixes\n\nhttps://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/thefive1hero/sunday-brunch-playlist-vol-1-the-blue-moon-cafe\n\nFor more information on Fresh Cut Wax please visit: www.FreshCutWax.com\n\nBuy Swag at: https://www.bonfire.com/store/fresh-cut-wax-dope-gear-spot/\n\nFor more music check out:\n\nGlobal Domination - The Album\n\nhttps://songwhip.com/renegadesworldwide/global-domination\n\nThe Big September â Maxi Single\n\nhttps://songwhip.com/youngbeard/big-september-remix\n\nMuzik for Wendi\n\nhttps://songwhip.com/thefive1hero/muzik-for-wendi\n\nSummer in SoCal\n\nhttps://songwhip.com/thefive1hero/summer-in-socal-oc-to-sd\n\nOn the Run Maxi Single\n\nhttps://songwhip.com/renegadesworldwide/on-the-run\n\nBurning\n\nhttps://songwhip.com/youngbeard/burning\n\n#hiphop #hiphopmusic #hiphopculture #femalerapper #rapmusic #rnb #dj #bayarearap #oakland #trap #beats #newmusic #unsignedrapper #femalerapper #rapper #hiphop #rap #music #rappers #femalerappers #explorepage #femaleartist #nickiminaj #upcomingrapper #unsignedrapper #newmusic #femalerap #unsignedartist #soundcloudrapper #explore #femcee #artist #cardib #newrapper #songwriter #indierapper #rapperlife #ukrapper #queen #rapperswanted #freestyle #therapper #queenofrap#lofi #downtempo #electronicmusic #music #ambient #electronica #chillout #triphop #deephouse #techno #electronic #hiphop #house #downtempomusic #newmusic #dj #housemusic #ambientmusic #lofi #chilloutmusic #psychedelic #beats #producer #idm #chill #spotify #musicproducer #psychill #instrumental #dub #experimentalmusic #reggaemusic #reggae #jamaica #dancehall #music #dancehallmusic #bobmarley #rootsreggae #reggaeroots #rasta #rastafari #reggaevibes #roots #onelove #reggaelovers #reggaeartist #dub #vybzkartel #bujubanton #caribbean #ska #hiphop #love #reggaedancehall #reggaeton #dj #rootsrockreggae #popcaan #jamaicanmusic #jamaican #edm #music #dj #housemusic #rave #dance #electronicmusic #techno #dubstep #producer #house #edmlifestyle #hiphop #party #edmfamily #trap #edmmusic #festival #trance #dancemusic #djlife #tomorrowland #deephouse #love #edmlife #edc #newmusic #plur #bass #djs\n\n3 Albums in One Day!"
