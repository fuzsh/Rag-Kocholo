The song \"Planet Rock\" was one of the earliest hits of the hip hop music genre and remains one of its pioneering recordings. The single's liner notes include members of Kraftwerk with the songwriting credits. In creating the track, portions of Kraftwerk's \"Numbers\" and \"Trans-Europe Express\" were interpolated (re-recorded in the studio, rather than through the use of a digital sampler), along with portions of songs by Captain Sky and Ennio Morricone.\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song \"Planet Rock\" was ranked by Rolling Stone magazine at #240 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,[3] and went on to become the first gold-certified vinyl 12-inch single. Slant Magazine listed the album at #84 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\".[4] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[5] \"Renegades of Funk\", the third track, was covered by Rage Against the Machine on their 2000 album Renegades.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nArthur Baker – producer, mixing\n\nKeith LeBlanc – producer\n\nHerb Powers Jr. – mastering\n\nLatin Rascals – remixing\n\nAfrika Bambaataa – producer, mixing\n\nJohn Aquilino – illustrations, hand lettering\n\nJay Burnett – mixing\n\nAlbert Cabrera – remixing\n\nSkip McDonald – producer\n\nTony Moran – remixing\n\nJohn Robie – producer, mixing\n\nLeRoi Evans – producer, mixing\n\nRae Serrano – producer\n\nAdrian Sherwood – mixing\n\nAndy Wallace – mixing\n\nDoug Wimbish – producer\n\nMonica Lynch – art direction\n\nSteven Miglio – artwork, design\n\nFats Comet – producer, mixing\n\nM.C.
