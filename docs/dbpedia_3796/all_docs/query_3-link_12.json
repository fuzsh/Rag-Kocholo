        "text": "NPR Tiny Desk Concert\n\nArtists, of every sound and station, gather in the NPR Music offices to perform for staffers — and have their songs broadcast to their world. New talents can become legends, and icons get to show a different side.\n\nIn 2014, Tiny Desk mastermind Bob Boilen mused on the best of what he had seen and heard.\n\nwrote Moon Hooch\n\nTaken at face value, Boilen’s commendation is perplexing. The New York trio isn’t a household name or taste-maker like some of the other superlative acts he mentioned: Adele, Gogol Bordello, Phoenix.\n\nAnd pressing play on their performance reveals three guys who look more like fraternity brothers than musical trailblazers.\n\nBut it takes less than 30 seconds to get what Boilen is saying, and to make listeners never doubt him again.\n\nTwo saxophonists and a drummer bob and weave around each other, both physically and musically.\n\nInitially, one plays with a traffic cone lodged in the bell of his horn; it is held in place by yellow police tape. They rock and squawk their way through 12 minutes of music.\n\nSkittering beats, full-throated peals and silkier tones merge in a sound that is something like jazz; something like funk; something like hip-hop; something like electronic music — yet none of those things.\n\nThat performance makes it clear why Moon Hooch is a band of unlikely, unsung musical heroes.\n\n“Their music is a mix of the best jazz, EDM and rock have to offer,” Boilen concluded. “It’s out there, it’s danceable and you may find yourself feeling a sense of reckless abandon!”\n\nTAKING IT TO THE STREETS\n\nThe members of Moon Hooch got off to an inauspicious start.\n\nSaxophonist Mike Wilbur and drummer James Muschler, classmates at The New School in New York City, took their music to the streets as buskers.\n\nWilbur described the initial sound as “intense” and improvisatory, the pair imposing a somewhat antagonistic attitude on passersby.\n\nThe two folded horn player Wenzl McGowen into the mix, playing street corners and subway tunnels. Wilbur and McGowen stumbled onto a dyadic form of music, creating a sort of two-part harmony.\n\nWilbur can clearly identify the moment Moon Hooch went from a sound experiment to a full-time gig.\n\nIt was 2010, the setting Washington Square Park. The trio, which wasn’t called Moon Hooch at the time, gathered to play on a weekday afternoon.\n\nMuschler pounded out a house beat; McGowen played a bass line, to which Wilbur added melody.\n\nIn little time, there was an “eruption of dance,” Wilbur said, with scores of people stepping into the scene, like something out of a musical.\n\n“None of us had ever experienced anything like that, so it was kind of obvious that we had to do it again,” Wilbur said.\n\nAnd so the band has, taking its act to increasingly bigger stages and playing with established artists such as They Might Be Giants and Lotus.\n\nRUNAWAY TRAIN\n\nThe Moon Hooch sound is both intricate and raucous; it always sounds as though the collective wheels are about to fall off, yet they never do.\n\nWilbur’s response to that description was to address the letter of it and affirm the spirit.\n\nOn one hand, much of the band’s catalog is through-composed, a term which means each section has its own musical identity, which isn’t repeated.\n\nAt the same time, Wilbur acknowledged the fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants attitude he and his bandmates possess.\n\n“We’re all kind of on the edge of falling off, in life,” he said. “ … Just trying to keep it together.”\n\nNO LABEL\n\nIt is somewhat reassuring to hear that Wilbur has as hard a time as anyone neatly describing the music Moon Hooch makes.\n\nIn the course of a brief conversation, he refers to metal, punk, house and jazz to illustrate pieces of the puzzle.\n\n“I don’t even know what it is really,” Wilbur said. “… It’s getting closer and closer to just expressions, which is the goal I think.”\n\nThe band’s early songs were written on computer software and, in a very real sense, he and McGowen think of their woodwind instruments like synthesizers, he said.\n\nTo date, the band’s ambitious vision is best realized on “Red Sky,” an album released in June via Hornblow, a small label that also serves artists such as Mike Doughty and Ozomatli.\n\nThe record is funky, spaced-out, strident and sexy, depending on the song and the moment within the song. It also features Wilbur’s vocals on several tracks.\n\nThe band’s aims for the album were relatively simple, Wilbur said; it wanted to make something more danceable and energetic than past recordings, something “closer to our incarnation,” he said.\n\n“Red Sky” is a fascinating document; it is formally creative and, at times, very physical, almost chest-rattling.\n\nwrote\n\nYet for all that is praiseworthy about the album, it already feels a bit stale to Wilbur — “I’m like three albums past that,” he said, pitting the band’s ongoing evolution against the slowness inherent to the business of making records.\n\n“We’re definitely always beyond where our releases are as a live band, which is cool I think for the listener because they hear the album and it’s one thing,” Wilbur said.\n\n“Then they see the show” and think “… ‘That is nothing like what I expected it to be.’ That’s kind of what we’re going for because an album is an album and it’s always going to be the same. But live music is always changing.”"
