        "text": "Review\n\nIf you want classic heavy rock... you've got it. The 2024 Foreigner and Styx tour was a juggernaut in the truest sense, Stateside at least. The two stadium guitar outfits have done a lot together over the years, and their joint US tour was the last in a long history of collaborative efforts, with Foreigner using this as the final chapter in their mammoth farewell tour, bringing a 50 year on-stage career to an end. Styx apparently have no intention of following suit, with frontman Tommy Shaw quoted in at least one interview saying the group will bow out \"when they drag me to the funeral home\" - fitting given the outfit are named after the mythical Greek river that would transport the dead from this life to the next. All that aside, if you know either troupe you'll know what this historic package sounds like - big, emotional, packed with power chords and soaring solos. If you don't, we just told you."
