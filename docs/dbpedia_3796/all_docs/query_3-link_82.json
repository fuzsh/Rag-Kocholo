        "text": "The Collectibles comp, which I discovered a few months ago, was my first experience with this band. Now it one of my favorite discs. I see that there is a remastered comp called Renegades of Funk and a 2CD comp of all their work called The Message. Both were recently released. I wondered if anyone here had heard either of the newer discs and had anything to say about their quality compared to the Collectibles disc. While I am at it, I have heard some Lonnie Liston Smith, but would be interested in some recommendations of his work, especially work in the same groove as Cymande. Thanks.\n\nI don't know much about Cymande, but you can't go wrong with Lonnie Liston Smith's Flying Dutchman albums from the mid 70s. Smooth and groovy jazz-funk, but somehow he magically escapes the many pitfalls those genres present. It may be too smoth for some, but I can't help but love it...\n\nThe best CD issues AFAIK are the ones on French RCA, called RCA Victor Gold Series. To my ears they sound excellent, 24bit remastered in digipaks and sometimes with bonus tracks. Issued around 2000-2002, I believe.\n\nAstral Travelling - the most jazzy of the bunch, kind of a serene version of Pharoah Sanders' more reflective moments\n\nCosmic Funk - where the classic sound starts to take shape. Highly recommended.\n\nExpansions - the classic. Indispensable.\n\nVisions of a New World - more of the same\n\nReflections of a Golden Dream - here it sounds like they are slowly aiming for the dancefloor. I still like it, but this may be a little too much for some people...\n\nAfter this I don't have any albums, so someone else will have to comment."
