Louis Bonaparte

Louis Bonaparte: (1778-1846) Napoleon's brother Louis was king of Holland (1806-10). He reluctantly married (1802) Hortense de Beauharnais. Napoleon forced him to abdicate because Louis, more concerned for the interests of the Dutch people than for those of France, defied the ruinous Continental System. He died in Italy. He was also the father of Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III), who was elected leader of France following the 1848 Revolution.
