        "text": "Louis Bonaparte (born September 2, 1778, Ajaccio, Corsica—died July 25, 1846, Livorno, Italy) was a French soldier and Napoleon I’s third surviving brother. As king of Holland (1806–10), he guarded the welfare of his subjects. His unwillingness to join the Continental System brought him into conflict with the emperor.\n\nAfter attending military school at Châlons, France, Louis accompanied Napoleon on the Italian campaign of 1796–97 and acted as his aide-de-camp in Egypt in 1798–99. In 1802 Napoleon as first consul married him to Joséphine’s daughter Hortense de Beauharnais; the forced union led to deplorable results springing from Louis’s violent jealousy of his wife and his growing resentment toward Napoleon for not allowing the couple to divorce. (Their youngest child, Charles-Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, survived to become Napoleon III.) In 1804 Louis was raised to the rank of general and the following year became governor of Paris.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nNapoleon proclaimed Louis king of Holland on July 5, 1806. From the first, the emperor reproached him for being too easy on his subjects. By 1809 Napoleon was considering annexing Holland in order to arrest the trade the Dutch secretly conducted with England. In 1810, failing to negotiate successfully with either England or Louis, the emperor dispatched French troops against the Dutch capital. Louis abdicated and fled his kingdom, which on July 9 Napoleon annexed to France."
