        "text": "Hortense (born April 10, 1783, Paris, France—died October 5, 1837, Arenenberg, Switzerland) was the queen of Holland, stepdaughter of Napoleon I, and mother of Napoleon III.\n\nThe daughter of the future empress Joséphine and of her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais, Hortense became one of the attractions of the court after Napoleon became first consul of the French in 1799. To strengthen her position, Joséphine encouraged a marriage between Hortense and Louis Bonaparte, Napoleon’s brother (1802). The marriage, although an unhappy one, produced three children, the third of whom, Charles-Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, survived to become Napoleon III. In 1806, when Louis became king of Holland, Hortense accompanied him to The Hague. Although Napoleon divorced Joséphine in 1809, he refused to allow Hortense and Louis a divorce but countenanced their separation in 1810, when Holland was annexed to France. Returning to Paris, Hortense in 1811 gave birth to a son by her lover, the comte de Flahaut; this son, who was adopted by a relative, was the future duc de Mornay."
