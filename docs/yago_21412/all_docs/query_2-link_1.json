        "text": "/\n\nNapoleon’s meddling in his siblings’ lives was the source of considerable angst for several of them. Napoleon had high expectations for his younger brother Louis, but Louis chafed at his brother’s authority. Still, he ultimately agreed to marry Napoleon’s step-daughter with Josephine, Hortense de Beauharnais, a marriage that would become notable most for the profound unhappiness of its spouses.\n\nFour years into their terrible marriage, Napoleon decided that the territory of the modern Netherlands was a bit too independent, and installed Louis as its new king. The French Emperor expected his brother to serve merely as a titled governor of the region, but Louis really stepped up in the position. He began learning Dutch, renounced his French citizenship and declared himself Dutch, and demanded that his mostly-French ministers do the same. He also demanded it of his wife, who had only reluctantly accompanied her husband to Holland.\n\nBut Hortense also thrived in her role as Queen, and her popularity among her Dutch subjects irritated her jealous husband – who was also popular and effective, to be clear – irrationally. And the couples’ success as monarchs there – Louis was known as ‘Louis the Good’ in Holland – irritated Napoleon irrationally. In 1810, their four year reign ended when Napoleon took it away from them by annexing it into France.\n\nThis effectively ended the sham of their marriage and the couple would spend the remainder of their lives apart. Neither lived long enough to see their youngest son become France’s last monarch, Napoleon III.\n\nListen ad-free at patreon.com/trashyroyalspodcast.\n\nSources\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte: A Life, by Alan Schom (Amazon)\n\nNapoleon: His Wives and Women, by Christopher Hibbert (Amazon.com)\n\nHortense de Beauharnais (en.wikipedia.org)\n\nLouis Bonaparte (en.wikipedia.org)\n\nNapoleon III (en.wikipedia.org)\n\nHortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland (theroyalarticles.com)\n\nLouis Bonaparte, Napoleon’s Defiant Puppet (shannonselin.com)"
