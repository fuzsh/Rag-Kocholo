        "text": "François Gérard\n\nThe French musician and noblewoman Hortense de Beauharnais (1783-1837) wrote 124 romances for voice and piano. These pieces were published in their entirety by Vialon and exhibited by Napoleon III at Malmaison in 1867. Her most famous piece, Partant pour la Syrie became a national anthem under the Second Empire and was the subject for piano variations by Johann Hummel and Franz Schubert. The texts for most of Hortense’s romances were written by Count Laborde, and professional court musicians assisted with the melodic development of each piece.\n\nHortense was the stepdaughter of Napoleon Bonaparte, and she was briefly married to his brother, Louis Bonaparte. During this marriage, she was the Queen of Holland. After separating from her husband and returning to France, she acquired the title Duchess of Saint-Leu.\n\nWorks:\n\n124 Romances for voice and piano\n\nc. 1817 12 Romances\n\nc. 1818 12 Romances dedicated to Eugène de Beauharnais\n\nafter 1827 12 Romances dedicated to Stéphanie de Beauharnais\n\nc.1857 12 Romances ‘Album Artistique’\n\n1867 Vialon published all 124 romances\n\nResources:\n\nPublic Domain Scores\n\nMemoirs\n\nSources:\n\nQuetin, Laurine. “Hortense.” Grove Music Online. 2001.\n\nWorks Featured on Expanding the Music Theory Canon\n\nJe L’Ai Reçu\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Scales, V, V7+ Inversions\n\nRegrets d’absence\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Intervals, Suspensions\n\nLes Jeunes Rêves D’Amour\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Intervals, Seventh Chords, vii°6, vii°7+Inversions, Secondary Function\n\nLe Prisonnier\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Intervals, Simple Meters, Passing Tone, V, V7+ Inversions, Secondary Function\n\nNe m’oubliez pas!\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Triads, Passing Tone, V, V7+ Inversions\n\nL’attente\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Triads, Cadences, V, V7+ Inversions, Predominant,\n\nPlus N’aimerai\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Triads, Predominant, Extended Tonicization\n\nFrancis\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Triads\n\nL’Aveu\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Triads, Passing Tone, Neighbor Tone\n\nLe Chant du Berceau\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Seventh Chords, V, V7+ Inversions\n\nM’entends-tu\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Seventh Chords, Predominant, Mediant\n\nQuand je vous vois\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Neighbor Tone\n\nLe Beau Dunois\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Cadences\n\nLa Sentinelle\n\nExcerpt\n\nPages: Cadences, Predominant, 6/4 Chords, Modulation\n\nLay de L’Exil.\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Predominant\n\nLe bon Chevalier\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Predominant\n\nDevine-moi\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: 6/4 Chords\n\nPenser À Toi\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: 6/4 Chords\n\nAutre ne sers\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Submediant\n\nJeanne d’Arc\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Submediant\n\nNous\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Secondary Function\n\nDis-moi Nanette\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Augmented 6th\n\nPartant pour La Syrie\n\nExcerpt\n\nPage: Extended Tonicization"
