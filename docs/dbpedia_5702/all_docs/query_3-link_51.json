        "text": "Yes. Children (we call them Unaccompanied Minors) of certain ages can travel alone on direct domestic flights (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). The itinerary must include only direct or through flights with no change of aircraft required. International locations are not included in unaccompanied minor travel. We’ll make sure your young flier is taken care of onboard and offered a snack and drink. View our current Unaccompanied Minor charge here.\n\nSpirit reserves the right to request documented proof of age to ensure Unaccompanied Minors are at least 5 years of age. Please be prepared to provide documentation (birth certificate, passport, etc.) upon request.\n\nIMPORTANT: Unaccompanied Minors are not allowed to travel on international flights.\n\nMINORS TRAVELING DOMESTICALLY\n\n(Includes Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands)\n\nAge of MinorUnaccompanied Minors4 Years and YoungerChildren 4 years old and younger may not travel alone. Another guest at least 15 years of age must accompany them.5-14 YearsChildren 5-14 years old must travel as an Unaccompanied Minor when not traveling with an adult at least 15 years old. Unaccompanied Minors are accepted only on direct flights which do not require a change of aircraft or flight number.15 Years and OlderGuests 15 years old and older are not required to have Unaccompanied Minor service, but they may be asked to present a picture ID or birth certificate to verify their age. The Unaccompanied Minor service charge will be collected for Guests 15 and older if the service is requested.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe following are guidelines that must be followed when a child is flying as an Unaccompanied Minor:\n\nWhen making a reservation, please advise us that the booking is for an Unaccompanied Minor.\n\nPlease check in at the ticket counter at least 60 minutes prior to departure.\n\nAt check-in, an Unaccompanied Minor form must be completed at the airport by drop-off parent/guardian with photo identification before we can accept the child for travel. This form will be inserted into the lanyard we provide that the Unaccompanied Minor must wear throughout the entire flight, and is needed for Spirit Airlines employees to identify Unaccompanied Minors.\n\nThe person dropping off the child at the airport should request a gate pass at the ticket counter, escort the child to the gate, and remain in the gate area with the Unaccompanied Minor until after the flight takes off. Gate passes will only be issued to non-traveling individuals who present a Government-issued photo ID.\n\nThe person dropping off the child must remain at the gate for 15 minutes after the flight takes off.\n\nThe child will be pre-boarded and identified to the Flight Attendant as an Unaccompanied Minor. Unaccompanied Minors arriving too late to be pre-boarded may be boarded last to ensure the introduction to the Flight Attendant.\n\nThe pick-up parent/guardian designated on the Unaccompanied Minor Form must arrive at the destination airport early to get a Gate Pass from the ticket counter and be at the gate for aircraft arrival. The child will be escorted off the aircraft by a Flight Attendant and released to the pick-up parent/guardian on the Unaccompanied Minor form."
