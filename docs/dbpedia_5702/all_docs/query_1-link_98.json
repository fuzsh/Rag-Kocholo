        "text": "Keely. Mondo. Noah. Tom Pidcock. The Fox Family. Simone.\n\nWe all knew Simone two weeks ago but what a joy to welcome the others into our lives since then. They’re patronuses warding off the darkness of Britain’s sordid riots – showing that to stand proudly beneath a flag can be something pure and vital, and a gesture full of friendship.\n\nWith the diversity of sports at these Games – from the waterborne pinball of kayak cross to the perfect ten seconds of the 100metres – it is impossible, my friends, not to find something to love.\n\nAnd, even better, because this moment is rare – these athletes don’t only want to win, they want to tell you why their sport is special and what it all means to them and their own.\n\nOlympians – except in a few obvious cases – aren’t actually jocks. What they are is nerds. They’re obsessed with something quite unusual. And now they are being celebrated, perhaps only briefly, for having found something unlikely they love to do.\n\nIn the wake of Mondo Duplantis’ world-record vault at a stunned Stade de France, people kept asking: just how do you find out you’re good at THAT? In his case, he was leaping bars at four – pole vault is a family trade.\n\nBut so much of it comes down to luck, useful genes, trying hard, getting up again and again, having the right people around you and really, really liking what it is you’re doing. This is not football, the rewards are not weekly and trimmed in gold. The attention will fade.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of talking with champions, medallists and would-be medallists for Eurosport nearly non-stop since the opening ceremony. And that’s where I’ve seen how much Olympians want to commute what they’re doing into something even more important.\n\nAfter interviewing British kayak cross silver medallist Joe Clarke I made a throwaway remark about how incredible his sport looked from the sidelines and how excited I was to get back to the UK and try it.\n\nHe immediately started helping me make plans – explaining where to go and how easy it is to get started; he wanted me to make a commitment to get on the water. He was proud others might love it as he did.\n\nThat’s not all that speaking with Olympians seconds after the greatest moment of their life – or their most crushing disappointment – has shown me. What’s more, what I’ve learned relates to us all.\n\nFirstly, one person’s silver medal is not another’s. When you step up to talk to anyone, you have to know their context, and you have to try to read their emotion. That’s what everyone else wants to share in and empathise with at the Olympics, and it’s what TV is so uniquely set up to express.\n\nSecondly, that everyone wants to share their joy with their family, their friends, their teachers, their dogs (see: T. Pidcock) when they have got the gold.\n\nBut almost always they hit out at themselves when they’ve missed. Great support will reflect joy at you, and it’s something magnified by being shared, but it goes the other way too. ‘It’s my fault, I made a mistake,’ said rower Ollie Wynne-Griffith, devastated after missing out on men’s pair gold despite leading throughout. Like Ollie, we need our people to cushion the self-criticism when life is tough.\n\nFinally, that most people don’t ‘feel’ at the moment of their greatest triumph. They can understand it logically but it’s about as real to them as it is to us watching.\n\nSo when you’re speaking to them just afterwards, they are pure emotion. Their adrenaline is crashing and they are intoxicated basically, riding waves of what’s just happened for the first time.\n\nBritish gold medallist Emily Craig put it the most beautifully of all after she became Olympic champion with her partner Imogen Grant three years after missing out on a rowing medal by 0.1 seconds: ‘You’re talking to two people who are standing here with everything we’ve ever wanted in our entire lives and we don’t know what to do.’\n\nWe all need the help of others to make sense of that, gold medallists or not.\n\nKate is with Eurosport throughout the Games – watch live via the discovery+ app\n\nMORE : Crazy melee of styles, shapes and moods has an obsession for us all\n\nMORE : Team GB gold medal winner shares inspirational note she received from her dad before he died"
