        "text": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nFROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS SERVICES\n\nProvidenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands – The Department of Special Education Needs Services of the Ministry of Education, Youth, Sports, and Culture is pleased to announce a call for registration for all children with neurodevelopmental disorders in the Turks and Caicos Islands. This initiative aims to identify and support children between the ages of 2 and 21 who are either formally or informally diagnosed with conditions such as language disorder, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, Down Syndrome, and more.\n\nThis registration is also open to children who are residents of Turks and Caicos but currently residing abroad. As we continue to develop our services, this initiative is critical for accounting for the number of children registered as having special needs, determining the number requiring special education, and identifying those in need of therapy services.\n\nDirector of Special Education Needs Services, Dr. Anya Malcolm-Gibbs, emphasized the importance of this registration drive, stating, “our goal is to ensure that every child with neurodevelopmental disorders receives the necessary support and services. By registering, we can better understand the needs of our community and allocate resources effectively to support our children and their families.” The Minister of Education, Hon. Rachel M. Taylor, commended the department, stating, “The Department of Special Education Needs Services continues to exemplify dedication to our children’s future. This registration initiative is a testament to their commitment to enhancing the lives of our neurodiverse children.”\n\nKey Details:\n\nWho should register: Children with neurodevelopmental disorders aged 2 to 21, either formally or informally diagnosed, including those residing abroad.\n\nConditions Included: Language Disorders, ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down Syndrome, Physical Impairments, Intellectual Disabilities, amongst others.\n\nConditions Excluded: Disruptive Disorders such as Conduct Disorder, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, as well as Mood Disorders and Anxiety Disorders.\n\nWe encourage all parents and guardians to complete the attached online registration form, which has also been translated to French and Spanish. This information is vital for us to provide the best possible services and support for our children. The registration will run for the months of August and September, and our database will continuously be updated.\n\nPlease follow this link to the registration page:\n\nhttps://forms.office.com/r/KAGYa3rc0W\n\nFor further information or assistance with the registration process, please contact the Department of Special Education Needs Services at sens@gov.tc. Together, we can create a brighter future for our children.\n\n**MEDIA RELEASE***\n\nTurks and Caicos, 27th August 2024 – At approximately 1:50 PM today (27th August 2024), the 911 Control Room received a report of a male who appeared to be floating off Grace Bay Beach, Providenciales.\n\nThe Marine Unit of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force immediately responded to the location and retrieved an unresponsive Caucasian male. The individual, who appeared to be in his mid to late forties, was transported to South Bank Marina for further assistance.\n\nUpon arrival at the Marina, the male was examined by a Medical Doctor, who later pronounced him deceased.\n\nThe identity of the deceased remains unknown, and at this stage there is nothing to suggest any criminality but various lines of enquiry to establish the full circumstances are being expedited.\n\nWe are asking anyone with information that may help in this investigation to contact the closest police station, 911, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-8477 to provide any information anonymously.\n\nAdditionally, individuals are encouraged to download the Crime Stoppers P3 app to share information.\n\nThe Bahamas Information Systems for Health (Bahamas)\n\nMinistry of Health and Wellness\n\nIS4H@BAHAMAS.GOV.BS\n\nThe Bahamas has moved one significant step closer to a seamless digital health information exchange system, as Information Systems for Health (IS4H) Bahamas has launched pilot programmes designed to stress-test a suite of new health information exchange applications including a new patient portal, an appointment scheduling app and more. The first phase of piloting these apps will last three months and will lead to improved efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare decision-making, paving the way toward a healthier, more secure Bahamas.\n\nThe IS4h Bahamas development tempo has increased dramatically over the past months. Now, as the digital architecture nears completion, the team is anticipating that the stress-testing will yield actionable results. Indeed, some segments of the Bahamian public are presently interacting with the initial stages of a successfully digitalized health information system.\n\nThe following applications are currently in Phase One of testing with Mental Health Counseling Services, Nutrition Counseling Services, the CNCD (Chronic, Non-Communicable Diseases) Screening Unit, and a health learning management system:\n\nBahamas National Patient Portal (BNPP), through which participants will be able in the first instance to view results online (CNCD Unit & Nutrition Counseling Services), and through which participants will soon be able to request a service online.\n\nPatientPay, a point of sale (POS) application which allows users and administrators access and flexibility in a secure environment to manage financial obligations from anywhere in the country.\n\nSupporting these public-facing apps are PatientLink Bahamas (Appointment Scheduler), through which patients will be able to view appointments and through which providers (Mental Health Counseling Services in the first phase) will be able to set and manage patient appointments online.; a one-time password (OTP) app which facilitates multi-factor authentication for increased data and information security; a Master Patient Index (MPI) which is the building block of the eventual electronic health record (EHR), and a business intelligence tool (BIT) which pools all the data from across the applications to allow for improved reporting, more detailed and customizable analysis and more data-driven public policy making.\n\nProfessional Development\n\nIn addition, the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) is also in the first phase of testing. Through Moodle, public health personnel will have online access to dynamic courses that will support training and continuous learning. The implementation of the LMS will facilitate more effective and efficient delivery of training. Moodle will also enable training and continuous learning to be accessible to the Family Islands.\n\nIn The Pipeline\n\nIS4H Bahamas technical experts will use the data and lessons learned in Phase One of piloting to refine the apps and the environment in which they operate before widespread adoption.\n\nIn the coming weeks, training of public health staff and providers will ramp up to ensure that the new digital health information exchange systems are fully utilized to improve health outcomes for everyone in the Bahamian public health system.\n\nAbout IS4H\n\nIS4H Bahamas is an initiative of the Government of The Bahamas through the Ministry of Health and Wellness, led by the Department of Public Health (DPH) and supported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). It aims to create a new digital health superhighway composed of new and existing health information systems woven together into a seamless, intuitive and user-friendly whole with the goal of “One patient, one record” in The Bahamas’ healthcare system. This will lead to better health policy and better health outcomes.\n\nContact:\n\nEmail: is4h@bahamas.gov.bs\n\nLike and Follow on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn & Twitter (X): @is4hbahamas"
