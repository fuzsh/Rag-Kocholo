If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic abuse of any kind, Refuge is here to support you — and we’re glad you’ve found us.\n\nSupport someone I know who is being abused\n\nIf you’re worried about someone you care about, learn more about how you can support them.\n\nWhat is domestic abuse?\n\nDomestic abuse (sometimes called ‘domestic violence’ or ‘intimate partner violence’) is an incident or a pattern of behaviour that is used by someone to control or obtain power over their partner or ex-partner. It is never the fault of the person who is experiencing it, and it is a crime.\n\n£25\n\na month could provide essentials for a woman arriving at a refuge. Every day, women escaping life-threatening situations seek safety in our refuges. Many arrive with little more than the clothes they are wearing. Your gift could go towards providing toiletries, food and clothing to help a woman through her first night this winter.\n\nIndependent advocacy\n\nIf you are looking for advocacy and support to understand your rights, options and empower you to use your voice. This can be through support with a wide range of agencies including civil and criminal courts, housing, health and education.\n\nEconomic abuse\n\nAbusers may seek to control your access to money or resources. We can support you to take back control.\n\nSupport for children\n\nIf someone at home is hurting you or another member of your family, that is not okay.\n\nSupport in the community\n\nYou may not need, or want, to access refuge accommodation. Our outreach workers support survivors in their homes or in a safe place within the community."
