The LIHEAP Toolkit provides outreach materials to help partners, stakeholders, and grant recipients reach eligible households. The LIHEAP Extreme Heat dashboard provides information on how LIHEAP is helping people stay safe, healthy, and prepared to combat heat stress.\n\nDisaster Flexibilities Hub\n\nOCS recently released the Disaster Flexibilities Hub, an information management tool that visually tracks and displays key data, guidance, and resources on declared disasters, disaster preparedness efforts, and the flexibilities built into OCSâ€™ block grant programs, including LIHEAP. The OCS Disaster Flexibilities Hub provides a one-stop shop for all the information you need to help you and your organization start to prepare for or respond to a disaster using OCS funding.\n\nNeed Help Finding Assistance?\n\nFor information on how to apply for energy assistance, please visit Energyhelp.us.\n\nThis site is available in English, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese. Video information and spotlights are available in English, Spanish, and Mandarin.\n\nFor information about the variation that exists among the LIHEAP Grant Recipients in the operation of their programs, please visit the LIHEAP Clearinghouse site.\n\nNotice: The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) does not provide direct grants to individuals; LIHEAP does not charge a fee for receiving a benefit. If you receive a message offering you a LIHEAP grant or requesting a fee, please contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Fraud Hotline at 1-800-447-8477.
