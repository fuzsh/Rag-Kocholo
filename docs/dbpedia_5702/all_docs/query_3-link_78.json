        "text": "Fear\n\nA person will likely be afraid of the consequences if they decide to leave their relationship. This could be fear of their partner’s actions or concern over their own ability to be independent.\n\nNormalized abuse\n\nIf someone grew up in an environment where abuse was common, they may not know what healthy relationships look like. As a result, they may not recognize that their partner’s behaviors are unhealthy or abusive.\n\nShame\n\nIt can be difficult for someone to admit that they’ve been or are being abused. They may feel that they’ve done something wrong, that they deserve the abuse, or that experiencing abuse is a sign of weakness. Remember that blame-shifting is a common tactic that their partner may use and can reinforce a sense of responsibility for their partner’s abusive behaviors.\n\nIntimidation\n\nA survivor may be intimidated into staying in a relationship by threats. They can be verbal or physical or threats to spread information, including secrets or confidential details (i.e. revenge porn, etc.). For LGBTQ+ people who haven’t come out yet, threats to out someone may be an opportunity for abusive partners to exert control.\n\nLow self-esteem\n\nAfter experiencing verbal abuse or blame for physical abuse, it can be easy for survivors to believe those sentiments. They may believe that they’re at fault for their partner’s abusive behaviors.\n\nLack of resources\n\nSurvivors may be financially dependent on their abusive partner or have previously been denied opportunities to work, a place to sleep on their own, language assistance, or a network to turn to during moments of crisis. These factors can make it seem impossible for someone to leave an abusive situation.\n\nDisability\n\nIf someone depends on other people for physical support, they may feel that their well-being is directly tied to their relationship. A lack of visible alternatives for support can heavily influence someone’s decision to stay in an abusive relationship if they have a disability.\n\nImmigration status\n\nPeople who are undocumented may fear that reporting abuse will affect their immigration status. If they have limited English proficiency, these concerns can be amplified by a confusing and convoluted legal system and an inability to express their circumstances to others.\n\nCultural context\n\nTraditional customs or beliefs may influence someone’s decision to stay in an abusive situation, whether held by the survivor or by their family and community. Learn more about abuse in different cultural contexts.\n\nChildren\n\nMany survivors may feel guilty or responsible for disrupting their familial unit. Keeping the family together may not only be something that a survivor may value but may also be used as a tactic by their partner to guilt a survivor into staying.\n\nLove\n\nExperiencing abuse and feeling genuine care for a partner who is causing harm are not mutually exclusive. Survivors often still have strong, intimate feelings for their abusive partner. They may have children together, want to maintain their family, or the person abusing them may simply be charming (especially at the beginning of a relationship) and the survivor may hope that their partner will return to being that person."
