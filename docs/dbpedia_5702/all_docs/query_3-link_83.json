        "text": "Trauma can have a serious effect on babies and toddlers. Many people wrongly believe that babies do not notice or remember traumatic events. In fact, anything that affects older children and adults in a family can also affect a baby, but they may not be able to show their reactions directly, as older children can.\n\nTraumatic and life-threatening events may include incidents such as car accidents, bushfires, sudden illness, traumatic death in the family, crime, abuse or violence in the community.\n\nTrauma can seriously disrupt important aspects of child development that occur before the age of three years. These may include relationship and bonding with parents, as well as foundational development in the areas of language, mobility, physical and social skills and managing emotions. Providing support to help the family rebuild a safe, secure and nurturing home will help the baby or toddler recover.\n\nHow trauma affects babies and toddlers\n\nBabies and toddlers are very helpless and depend on their family and parents for a sense of safety and security. They need emotional nurturing, through loving and reassuring interactions, and help with coping in an ongoing and consistent way. This is how babies and toddlers develop and grow.\n\nDuring their early months and years, children are very sensitive to:\n\nproblems affecting their parents or main caregivers, which may include fear, sadness or being overwhelmed\n\nseparation from their parent or primary carer – for instance, absence due to injury or other factors related to the trauma. This can have a double impact: distress of the separation itself and insecurity of having to manage without the safety, understanding and nurturing their carer provides. Both can slow recovery and increase the impact of the trauma\n\nwhat is happening in the household – babies and toddlers are affected by noise, distress or a very mixed-up routine where they are not sure what is happening next\n\ndisruption to the development of a bond or close relationship with their parent or lack of parental understanding – trauma can sometimes get in the way and make the formation of this bond more difficult.\n\nIf any of these things are happening, it is important to think about the effect on the baby. If the family or primary carer is affected, the baby is probably also affected.\n\nCommon reactions to trauma in babies and toddlers\n\nWhen babies or toddlers are exposed to life-threatening or traumatic events, they become very scared – just like anybody else. Some common reactions may include:\n\nunusually high levels of distress when separated from their parent or primary carer\n\na kind of ‘frozen watchfulness’ – the child may have a ‘shocked’ look\n\ngiving the appearance of being numb and not showing their feelings or seeming a bit ‘cut off’ from what is happening around them\n\nloss of playful and engaging smiling and ‘coo-ing’ behaviour\n\nloss of eating skills\n\navoiding eye contact\n\nbeing more unsettled and much more difficult to soothe\n\nslipping back in their physical skills such as sitting, crawling or walking and appearing more clumsy.\n\nWhat parents and carers can do to help babies and toddlers cope with trauma\n\nStructure, predictability and nurturing are key to helping a baby or toddler who has been traumatised. There are a number of things parents and carers can do to help their baby or toddler cope with and recover from trauma:\n\nSeek, accept and increase any support you need to help you manage your own shock and emotional response.\n\nGet information and advice on how the baby or toddler is going.\n\nLearn to recognise and manage the child’s signs of stress and understand cues for what is going on for them.\n\nReduce the intensity and length of the initial stress reaction by helping the child settle and to feel safe and cared for as quickly as possible.\n\nMaintain the child’s routines around being held, sleeping and feeding.\n\nOffer a calm atmosphere and soothing activities.\n\nSpend time just being with the child, giving them your full attention and letting communication flow.\n\nAvoid any unnecessary separations from important caregivers.\n\nAvoid exposing the child to reminders of the trauma, where possible.\n\nExpect that the child may temporarily regress (go backwards) in their behaviour or become ‘clingy’ and dependent. This is a normal adjustment to stress – it is one of the child’s ways of trying to cope with what they have been through.\n\nTake time out to recharge yourself.\n\nWhen to seek help for babies and toddlers after a traumatic event\n\nThe first and second year of a child’s life has lots of ups and downs. Development may slow down for a while and then move forward again. It can sometimes be difficult to work out if this is just one of those times or whether something more serious is happening.\n\nIt may help to seek professional advice if:\n\nthe baby or toddler is slipping backwards in development\n\ndevelopment slows down, especially if this occurs following a traumatic event or major disruption in the family and household\n\nyou feel that the trauma has got in the way of knowing your baby, developing close, loving feelings and feeling connected to them – it is important to seek help to get this bonding process back on track\n\nyou have been separated from the baby or toddler at the time of danger or during its aftermath\n\nyou or other carers are emotionally unwell with stress, grief, anxiety, exhaustion or depression – this can have a serious effect on the baby or toddler\n\nyour family has lost their home and community.\n\nThere is increasing evidence to suggest that the younger a child, the more serious the post-traumatic problems. Actively seeking help and advice early on to support recovery is important.\n\nIf at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.\n\nInformation in your language\n\nTrauma dhe fëmijët - të porsalindurit deri në dy vjet (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Albanian)\n\nالصدمات والأطفال - حديثي الولادة حتى عامين (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Arabic)\n\n创伤和儿童——新生儿至两岁儿童 (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Chinese Simplified)\n\n創傷事件與兒童：新生嬰兒至兩歲幼童 (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Chinese Traditional)\n\nصدمه و اطفال – نوزاد تا دو ساله (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Dari)\n\nΤραύμα και παιδιά - νεογέννητα έως δύο ετών (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Greek)\n\nअभिघात और बच्चे - नवजात शिशुओं से दो वर्ष तक (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Hindi)\n\nTrauma e bambini da 0 a 2 anni (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Italian)\n\nਸਦਮਾ ਅਤੇ ਬੱਚੇ - ਨਵਜੰਮੇ ਬੱਚੇ ਤੋਂ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਦੋ ਸਾਲ ਤੱਕ ਦੇ (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Punjabi)\n\nKiwewe na watoto - watoto wachanga hadi wenye umri wa miaka miwili (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Swahili)\n\nChấn thương và trẻ em - trẻ sơ sinh đến hai tuổi (Trauma and children 0 to 2 years - Vietnamese)\n\nWhere to get help\n\nYour GP (doctor)\n\nYour maternal and child health nurse\n\nYour local community health centre\n\nPaediatrician or Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist – your doctor can refer you\n\nPhoenix Australia Centre for Post-traumatic Mental HealthExternal Link Tel.
