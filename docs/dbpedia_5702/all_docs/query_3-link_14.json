        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nAirlines have specific age requirements and fees for unaccompanied minors, typically ranging from 5 to 14 years old.\n\nSome carriers offer escort services, in-flight monitoring, and hand-off procedures to ensure the child is safe and accounted for throughout the journey.\n\nBooking requirements often include advanced reservations and completed forms, with specific drop-off and pick-up protocols at airports.\n\nSending your child on a flight alone can be an exciting (and nerve-wracking) experience. Whether theyâve been flying with you since babyhood or are just getting their travel legs now, you and your child need to be prepared for travel as an unaccompanied minor.\n\nIn the U.S., airlines have a wide array of rules and costs when it comes to young flyers traveling alone. Letâs look at each airlineâs policy for exactly what you need to know before your big kid takes to the skies on their own.\n\nUnaccompanied Minor Basics\n\nFor countless reasons, you may find that sending your child on a flight alone makes sense for you and your family.\n\nWhether they are going to meet up with their other parent, grandparents, friends, family, school, or summer camp, being prepared will help ensure a safe and comfortable trip.\n\nAlthough rules vary by airline, in most cases, an unaccompanied minor can be a child between the ages of 5 and 14. You can expect to pay up to $150 for an unaccompanied service from the airline to help with the travel logistics.Â\n\nBelow is a chart to take a quick view of policies, followed by a more in-depth breakdown of each airline.\n\nUnaccompanied Minor Policies\n\n*Prices shown are for one-way flights and are in addition to the price of the ticket\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAlaska Airlines has Junior Jetsetters, an unaccompanied minor service for kids 5 to 17 on domestic and international flights.\n\nWhen flying with Alaska, Junior Jetsetters receive a lanyard and a wristband so staff and crew can easily identify them. Kids will receive early boarding and a special safety briefing to make sure they are familiar with the emergency protocols.\n\nYour child will be supervised for their entire journey for $50 on nonstop flights. Kids ages 8 to 17 can fly a more complex itinerary with connections for $75.Â\n\nJunior Jetsetters who have attained MVP, MVP Gold, Gold 75K, or Gold 100K Mileage Plan status have these fees waived.\n\nParents or guardians can escort the child all the way to the gate as long as they have obtained an escort pass at the ticket counter.\n\nTo book a ticket for an unaccompanied minor on Alaska Airlines, call 800-252-7522.\n\nHot Tip: Some Alaska Airlines routes may not allow unaccompanied minors, including for seasonal severe weather.\n\nAllegiant Air\n\nAllegiant Air does not allow unaccompanied minors.\n\nThe airline considers anyone 15 and older an adult.

Your child probably is, too. Making sure that they are emotionally and mentally prepared will be extremely important.\n\nGoing over exactly what the trip will entail, what is expected of them, who they can rely on, and what to do in an emergency can be calming and helpful.\n\nRemind them that the flight crew is there to help them and that someone will be waiting for them at the other end of the flight.\n\nCharge the Gadgets\n\nFor kids, nothing is worse than their favorite piece of technology running out of battery.\n\nLet them indulge in screen time and ensure their phones, tablets, and other devices are all charged up for the trip. And donât forget the chargers!\n\nThis will also ensure they can stay in touch with you if needed.\n\nUse an AirTag\n\nApple AirTags have exploded in popularity to keep track of checked luggage.\n\nWell, there is no more precious cargo than your child. Toss an AirTag in their backpack (Apple sells aÂ single AirTag for $29, or a pack ofÂ 4 AirTags for $99), or, better yet, use an AirTag bracelet.\n\nWith an AirTag, you can see almost exactly where they are, which can be handy during pick-up.\n\nYes, there will be cell phones and proper documentation from the airline, but you never know.\n\nIt canât hurt to have a list of emergency contacts and phone numbers on a piece of paper, if needed.\n\nPack Snacks\n\nWe all function better when we arenât hungry, right?\n\nEven though some unaccompanied minor services offer snacks, itâs a good idea to make sure your kid is well-fed before their flight and has a bag full of snacks to munch on during their journey.\n\nSend Money\n\nYouâve packed snacks, and the airline will likely provide some as well, but itâs a good idea to give your kid some spending money just in case of a long delay.\n\nWhether theyâre waiting to board or on the plane for longer than planned, having a little cash or a credit card can come in handy if they need to buy something.\n\nMinimize Carry-Ons\n\nThis goes for all travelers, but the less you board with, the less likely it will get left behind.\n\nA backpack is probably the easiest for smaller travelers, so they donât have to deal with reaching into overhead bins.\n\nTrack the Flight\n\nBeing able to track the flight will help calm a parent or guardianâs nerves and keep the person picking up the unaccompanied minor informed if there are any delays.\n\nWhether using the airlineâs app or a third-party app such as FlightAware, a little bit of technology in your pocket is nice.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSending your little one on a flight by themselves is a huge moment filled with a plethora of feelings with everything from excitement to fear. But with the right preparation, your unaccompanied minor could make their first successful trip of many to come.\n\nMany airlines will make sure that your child has a safe and enjoyable flight, and if they are flying Alaska Airlines and have elite status, they wonât even charge you!\n\nMany factors go into whether or not you and your family are comfortable enough with this type of travel. Hopefully, the information you found here will help with your decision.\n\nSafe travels!"
