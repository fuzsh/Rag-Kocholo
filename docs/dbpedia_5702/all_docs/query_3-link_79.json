        "text": "A. Statutory Authority\n\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(16), the court may provide that the defendant “permit a probation officer to visit him at his home or elsewhere as specified by the court.”\n\nB. Standard Condition Language\n\nYou must allow the probation officer to visit you at any time at your home or elsewhere, and you must permit the probation officer to take any items prohibited by the conditions of your supervision that he or she observes in plain view.\n\nC. Purpose\n\nThis condition serves the statutory sentencing purposes of public protection and rehabilitation. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(C) and (D).\n\nThis condition enables the probation officer to satisfy the statutory requirements to keep informed of the conduct and condition of the defendant, report the defendant’s conduct and condition to the sentencing court, and aid the defendant and bring about improvements in his or her conduct and condition. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3603(2)-(3).\n\nThis condition allows the probation officer to implement effective supervision strategies by making the probation officer aware of the defendant’s living environment, standard of living, and ability to pay criminal debt; by facilitating the development of rapport with the defendant’s family members, friends, and other members of the defendant’s support network; and by providing an environment that may in some cases be more conducive to open and honest communication than the probation office.\n\nThis condition allows the probation officer to implement supervision methods demonstrated by social science to be effective at achieving positive outcomes.\n\nResearch suggests that correctional interventions that follow the principles of evidence-based practices (e.g., the risk principle, the need principle, and the responsivity principle) promote positive change in the defendant and reduce the probability of recidivism. Allowing officers to visit the home, work, and the community permits them to be aware of the defendant’s risk level and criminogenic needs throughout the period of supervision and to implement supervision practices that are responsive to the learning style and abilities of the individual defendant and are demonstrated to alter thinking patterns (see: Chapter 1, Section III(A)(1)).\n\nResearch suggests that the probability of recidivism is reduced when defendants develop and maintain prosocial bonds to family, school, and work. Allowing the probation officer to be aware of the defendant’s home, family, and work environment through home and community visits helps the probation officer become aware of the defendant’s social environment and assists with the creation of a prosocial environment (see: Chapter 1, Section III(A)(2)).\n\nResearch suggests that exposure to antisocial associates increases the probability of recidivism. Home and community visits permit the probation officer to remain aware of the defendant’s associates (see: Chapter 1, Section III(A)(3)).\n\nResearch suggests that for a criminal event to occur there must be an opportunity to commit a crime. Probation officers may work with defendants on supervision, family members, neighbors, other community members, and law enforcement agencies to structure and monitor the defendant’s routine activities and reduce the extent to which defendants come into contact with criminal opportunities. Probation officers may also monitor defendants through contacts with the defendant and his or her social network, verifying employment, restricting travel, and providing positive reinforcement for prosocial routine activities. Allowing the probation officer to visit the home, work, or elsewhere in the community permits the probation officer to be aware of the defendant’s living environment and social network in order to implement supervision strategies to reduce criminal opportunities (see: Chapter 1, Section III(A)(4)).\n\nD. Method of Implementation"
