We are here to help you understand and navigate this process.\n\nBelow are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions by category:\n\nFormer Assistance Arrears Pass Through\n\n2022 Pass Through Increase\n\nPaperless Transition\n\nGeneral Information\n\nLegal and Family Law\n\nProperty Liens and Child Support\n\nMaking Child Support Payments\n\nReceiving Child Support Payments\n\nElectronic Payment Card\n\nHow to Access Your Customer Connect Account\n\nParentage Opportunity Program\n\nCases Managed by a Local Child Support Agency\n\nPrivate (Non IV-D) Cases\n\nMilitary and Veterans\n\nTribal Relations\n\nCustomer Relations\n\nFormer Assistance Arrears Pass Through\n\n1. When will Former Assistance Arrears Pass Through begin/become effective?\n\nEffective Summer of 2024, payments received toward government-owed debt will be distributed (pass through) to parents who previously received cash assistance instead of reimbursing the state general fund for assistance services provided to the parents.\n\n2022 Pass Through Increase\n\n1. Why did I suddenly get more money?\n\nStarting January 1, 2022, if you receive cash assistance for your child or children through the CalWORKs program, the amount of the current month’s child support payment that is “passed through” to you may change from $50 up to $100 if you have one child, and up to $200 if you have two or more children living in the home. This is because the law that covers this “pass through” has permanently changed.\n\nLearn more in our Quick Tip video below:\n\nEnglish\n\nSpanish\n\n2. What does the Pass Through increase mean for me or the other parent?\n\nDOES NOT mean that the parent ordered to pay support is paying more. The law changed to let families have more money while the government keeps less for reimbursement benefits.\n\nDOES NOT mean that you will receive less cash assistance through the CalWORKs program.\n\nIS NOT a mistake, and you do not have to return any of the increased amount you may receive.\n\n3. What if my child support payment is less than the “Pass Through” amount?\n\nIf the current child support collected is less than $100 for 1 child, or less than $200 for 2 or more children, you will only receive the amount collected, NOT the increased amount.\n\n4. How do I get the payment increase?\n\nThere is no action required and the increase will automatically start for child support collected on or after January 1, 2022. For more information, please view the infographic available in English, Spanish, and an accessible version below:\n\n2022 Pass Through Increase Infographic (English)\n\n2022 Pass Through Increase Infographic (Spanish)\n\n2022 Pass Through Increase Infographic (English and Spanish Accessible)\n\nPaperless Transition\n\n1.

If I already enrolled in Direct Deposit, why did I receive an Electronic Payment Card?\n\nIt may be based on a system delay.

What if I want to cancel my Direct Deposit?\n\nYou will need to enroll in the Electronic Payment Card program before you cancel your Direct Deposit.\n\n19. What if I want to cancel my Electronic Payment Card?\n\nYou will need to enroll in Direct Deposit before canceling your Electronic Payment Card.\n\n20.

How do I download the GoProgram mobile app?\n\nThe mobile app is available for iOS and Android and can be downloaded from the app store on your mobile device. The app is called Go Program Way2Go Card.\n\nGeneral Information\n\n1. What is child support?\n\nChild support is the ongoing contribution of money to help pay for the living and medical expenses of a child or children until they are adults. The amount that must be paid is called the child support order.\n\nUnder federal and state law, BOTH parents have a legal duty to provide financial support for their children.\n\nThe goal is to have children share in the standard of living of both parents, so the court may order either or both parents to pay child support.\n\n2. What can Child Support Services do to help me?\n\nThe child support office in your county or region can provide the following services:\n\nEstablishing parentage\n\nLocating parents\n\nRequesting child support orders from the court\n\nRequesting medical support orders from the court\n\nEnforcing child and spousal support orders\n\nModifying child support orders\n\nCollecting and sending child support\n\nLearn more in our Quick Tip video below:\n\n3. What CAN'T Child Support Services do for me?\n\nChild support offices do not:\n\nHandle custody or visitation matters\n\nHandle divorces\n\nObtain or enforce restraining orders\n\nEstablish spousal support orders\n\nLearn more in our Quick Tip video below:\n\n4. How is the amount of child support payments decided?\n\nChild support amounts are based on a review of both parent’s monthly income and the amount of time the child spends with each parent.\n\nThe Child Support Commissioner or Family Law Judge sets the amount of a child support order.\n\nAll income is taken into consideration and can be money, property or services, including:\n\nWages from a job\n\nTip Income\n\nCommissions\n\nBonuses\n\nIndependent contractor income\n\nUnemployment benefits\n\nDisability and worker’s compensation payments\n\nDepartment of Veteran Affairs disability payments\n\nInterest Income\n\nDividend Income\n\nRental Income\n\nSocial Security or pensions\n\nAny payments that become due such as lottery winnings and insurance payouts\n\nWatch our Instructional video below to learn more:\n\n5. Do parents have to provide health insurance for children?\n\nYes, health insurance must be included in any child support order for all cases. If health insurance is not immediately available, the court will order both parents to provide insurance when it does become available.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video to learn more:\n\n6. How long do I have to pay child support?\n\nUnder California law, you pay child support until the child turns 18, or 19 if the child is unmarried and still attending high school full time. Under special circumstances, the court may order child support to continue after the child is an adult.\n\nIf past-due support (called arrears) is still owed, the local child support agency may continue to enforce collection until the balance including interest is paid in full.\n\n7. Is my child support case information open to the public?\n\nChild support case information is confidential and not open to the public. However, all documents in court files or county recorder files are public records and can be viewed by the general public.\n\n8. How do I open a child support case?\n\nEither parent can enroll in services or open a child support services case, as can a child’s legal guardian. If you already have a court order, Child Support Services offers neutral assistance with every part of the process, keeps records, and helps both parties stay on track. If you do not have an order, enrolling in services means your local child support agency will help you locate the other parent, establish legal paternity/parentage if required, get a court order and see that it is enforced in every state and many foreign countries.\n\nOur new simplified enrollment form makes it quick and easy to enroll for child support services.\n\n9. I’m afraid my ex will hurt me or the kids if I ask for your help. What should I do?\n\nYou are protected by law – California Child Support Services will never release your personal information to the other parent in your case without a court order. However, some documents that contain your personal information may be filed with the court. If you have domestic violence concerns, be sure to tell your caseworker. Please email DCSSOCPA@dcss.ca.gov for a list of domestic violence shelters and resources in your area.\n\nCalifornia Child Support Services is required by law to send child support case information to the federal government. In an interstate case, that information will be released to child support agencies in other states. However, if you are a victim of family violence a “non-disclosure order” can prevent the sharing of your personal information to the other parties involved. To protect this information you must fill out the Family Violence Questionnaire and send it to the child support agency handling your case – but you must have been granted a restraining order or “good cause exception” from cooperation.\n\nIf you don’t have a restraining order or good cause exception and are still concerned for your safety and the safety of your children, you can get your own non-disclosure order through the courts. Contact your attorney of the Family Law Facilitator in your county for help.\n\n10. What does “private child support case” mean?\n\nIf you have a child support order that was set by a court but have not asked a local child support agency for help enforcing the order, that case is called “private”. Please note that private cases do not automatically go to Child Support Services once a court order is filed.\n\nIn private cases, the State still processes the payments made by withholding wages through the employer of the parent paying support.\n\nIf you have a private case and want help, either with enforcement or with keeping track of your payments to prove your compliance, you have the right to open a case with Child Support Services.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video below to learn more:\n\n11. If I have a private case and need help, can I use Child Support Services?\n\nYes. It is a good idea to open a case, whether you are the parent paying or receiving child support. Your caseworker will keep records, direct you to other resources that might benefit you, and be able to assist you if your situation changes. Child support can be complicated, and your local agency is there to help you navigate the system.\n\nIf you do not receive public cash assistance, there is an annual fee to cover costs.\n\n12. If I have a private case and need to set up payments, what should I do?\n\nWhen you enter into a court order with payments for child and/or spousal support – you must complete a “Child Support Case Registry” form and an “Income Withholding for Support” form. Your attorney or a Family Law Facilitator can help you with this.\n\nThe Income Withholding Form must be given to your employer, and a copy needs to be mailed to the California State Disbursement Unit at:\n\nCalifornia State Disbursement Unit (SDU)\n\nP.O. Box 980218\n\nWest Sacramento, CA 95798-0218\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video to learn more:\n\n13. What if one of the parents moves out of state, or lives in another country?\n\nChild support orders can be enforced anywhere in the United States, and in many foreign countries. Contact your local child support agency if you or the other parent moves after a child support order is filed, or if you need to file an interstate case.\n\nTwo laws, called the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act and the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, prevent a state from changing another state’s court order.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video below to learn more:\n\n14. If I live in another country, how can I contact California Child Support?\n\nFor international participants in a child support case, the contact number is 1-408-273-0073.\n\n15. Why am I being charged an annual fee?\n\nUnder federal law, the California Department of Child Support Services is required to charge a yearly service fee for certain, non-assisted cases. If the fee applies to you, you will receive an annual service fee assessment notice in October for each case to which the fee applies. This annual fee changes from $25 to $35 on cases that received payments equal to or more than $550 when assessed on 10/1/2020, and annually thereafter.\n\nLegal & Family Law\n\n1. What do I do if I get a Summons and Complaint?\n\nContact your local child support agency. You have only 30 days to respond, and your local agency can help you fill out the “Answer” form and file it with your county’s Superior Court. A Family Law Facilitator can also help you with this.\n\nWatch our Instructional video below to learn more:\n\n2. What happens if I forget about or ignore the Summons and Complaint?\n\nThe child support case will proceed, and the court will set the order at the amount proposed in the Summons and Complaint. After the order is set, you will have to ask the court for permission to change it. If you want your facts and financial situation taken into consideration before the amount is set, you must respond.\n\n3. If I file the “Answer” will I get to talk to the Judge or Child Support Commissioner?\n\nYes. If you respond to the Summons and Complaint with an Answer and disagree that you are legally responsible for the child or children named, or disagree with the amount of child support requested, you will be given a court date.\n\n4. Is there a way to avoid going to court?\n\nYes. If both parents agree on a child support amount, you can sign a legal agreement called a “Stipulation.” This document establishes legal responsibility for the children and becomes the official child support order.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video below to learn more:\n\n5. What is in a Stipulation?\n\nStipulations vary with circumstances, but basically say that the parent being asked to pay support agrees that he or she is the child’s parent, is willing to pay child support (and health insurance when available) and is willing to let the court file the order without appearing in court.\n\n6. What is “Allocation”?\n\nIf you have multiple child support cases, there are limits to the amount of money that can be taken from your paycheck. In these cases, the money that can be taken is “allocated” among your cases based on a priority system. This allocated amount may not be the entire amount due, and in that case the balance due becomes “arrears” and interest will be charged until the total is paid off.\n\n7. If either parent loses a job, or starts making more money, will the child support payment automatically change?\n\nNo. A child support order can only be changed by a new order or a stipulation approved by the court. Either parent has the right to ask for a review of the child support case if there is a change in circumstances of either person.\n\nChanges that can result in a new support order include a substantial increase or decrease in either parent’s income, a change in custody, or a change in the amount of time the child or children spend with each parent.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video below to learn more:\n\n8. What happens if the parent ordered to pay child support has the money but still won’t pay?\n\nThe State of California takes refusal to pay child support very seriously. Enforcement actions on those not paying support can include:\n\nSuspension of driving license\n\nSuspension of passport\n\nSuspension of professional licenses\n\nIntercepting tax refunds\n\nIntercepting insurance payments\n\nIn extreme cases, the court may find the parent “in contempt of court” which can result in arrest and imprisonment, but this is used only when all other enforcement tools have failed.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video to learn more:\n\n9. If I receive CalWORKS or KinGAP (government cash assistance/welfare), does this affect how much child support I can receive?\n\nYes. By law, you can EITHER receive the court ordered child support OR the cash assistance, but not both. Starting January 1, 2022, if you receive cash assistance for your child or children through the CalWORKs program, the amount of the current month’s child support payment that is “passed through” to you may change from $50 up to $100 if you have one child, and up to $200 if you have two or more children living in the home. This is because the law that covers this “passthrough” has permanently changed.\n\n10. Does California Child Support Services enforce spousal support orders?\n\nUnder Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), section 302.31(a)(2), states must enforce spousal support for a spouse or former spouse who is living with the children provided two conditions are met. First, enforcement shall occur only if a support obligation has been established for that spouse and second, only if the child support obligation is being enforced under the state plan (as opposed to a “private” case). Under this rule, California Child Support Services can only collect spousal support while collecting current support for a minor child. Once all the children have legally emancipated, California Child Support Services can no longer collect or enforce a spousal support order.\n\nThis applies to current support only. Spousal support has nothing to do with the collection of past due child support, or “arrears”.\n\nProperty Liens & Child Support\n\n1. The title company says there is a lien on my house due to unpaid child support. What is this?\n\nTitle companies play a critical role in the collection of child support. Child support agencies are required by state regulations to file liens and abstracts of judgment in all cases where there is an active child support order. Because the abstracts do not reference a specific property, they do not appear on the initial title search of the property address. They will appear during the final title search of the paying parent’s name and/or social security number. Whenever that parent buys, sells, or refinances a piece of real estate, the title company is required to contact California Child Support Services to determine whether obligations exist. The parent’s support order takes precedence and their children may benefit in some manner from the transaction.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip to learn more:\n\n2. What happens when a title company discovers a lien?\n\nThe title company will request a “demand” from the creditor (Child Support Services will be the creditor that recorded the judgment lien or abstract lien). The child support agency will prepare a statement of how much is owed on the judgment. This is known as the “demand”. In the case of an on-going child support order if the debtor is behind in his or her payments the demand will be for the amount of the overdue support.\n\nIf there is a delay in settling the demand it is important to understand that the amount owed may change, and an updated demand may be needed. Failing to make additional payments toward child support obligations will cause the amount owed to increase.\n\n3. If a child support lien or abstract of judgment exists, who do I contact and what information is needed?\n\nThe title company should submit a “demand request” and a copy of the abstract or lien to the attention of the Demand Desk of the local child support agency. The written demand request must be submitted using company letterhead with telephone and fax numbers. The title company must include the following information:\n\nThe client’s full name\n\nSocial Security Number\n\nDate of Birth\n\nDriver’s License Number\n\nProperty Address\n\nA copy of the Abstract of Support Judgment or Lien\n\nA copy of the borrower’s Authorization to Release Information form\n\nThe agency will perform research using the information you provide to verify the facts of any abstract or lien and then report back to the title company. Incomplete information may result in the request being delayed.\n\n4. How can a title company avoid delay at the close of escrow when the client has a Child Support Judgment Lien?\n\nAbstracts and support liens do not attach to a particular piece of property, so it is important to perform name searches on the parties involved in the transaction. If the Title Company waits until the end of a transaction to do this, they may experience a delay. The following best practices may help avoid delays at the close of escrow:\n\nStart the research early\n\nTell the title company that you have a child support case, if you do there is a chance a demand will be needed\n\nCheck your credit report. California Child Support Services is required to report parents with arrears to the major credit reporting agencies.\n\nWe will need to verify the abstract or support lien and then determine how much support is owed before we can issue a “demand”. We understand the urgency and will work diligently to provide a response to your demand request.\n\n5. What happens after a demand for payment is received by a title company?\n\nWhen Selling or Refinancing Property\n\nIf you are selling or refinancing property and there is money coming to you, that money must be applied toward the child support demand until the arrears have been paid in full. Child Support Services will send a “matured installment” if current child support continues to be owed, or a “release of lien” if the arrears have been paid and current child support is no longer being charged. These documents will be recorded by the escrow company after payment on the demand is made.\n\nWhen Buying Property\n\nIf you are buying a piece of property and owe past due support, one of the following could happen:\n\nIf you are currently paying support through a wage assignment and your pay history is good, the child support agency may subordinate its lien in favor of the first deed of trust on the new purchase.\n\nIf you have a poor pay history and are not currently on a wage assignment, then the agency will demand that the debt be paid in full.\n\n6. Where should property lien payments be sent?\n\nPlease make all checks payable to the California Department of Child Support Services. For proper identification the title company should include your full name, child support case file number, and Social Security number on the face of the check.\n\nPayment Address\n\nState Disbursement Unit\n\nP.O. Box 989067\n\nWest Sacramento, CA 95798-9067\n\n7. If I have a property lien recorded and I am current on my child support and only owe future support, what process is followed?\n\nIf you have a property lien but are current with your child support payments and have no past due obligations, a matured installment is sent to the escrow company in response to the demand request. This document indicates that all support obligations are paid up to date.\n\n8. If I am just refinancing my property and not taking any money (equity) out, will Child Support Services subordinate their lien in favor of the new mortgage?\n\nThis is determined on a case by case basis. If you are paying regularly by wage assignment or show a steady pay history and the arrears are not excessive, we will consider subordination of the lien to the new first trust deed (mortgage). Otherwise, we will demand payment of the arrears before subordination or matured installment will be issued.\n\nIf there are insufficient funds to pay the entire debt owed, a partial payment may be accepted and the remainder of the debt subordinated to the first trust deed (mortgage). California Child Support Services legal staff will make this decision after a thorough review of the parent’s payment record and consultation with the person ordered to receive the support.\n\n9. Should the title company be concerned with prior quit claim deeds issued on the property?\n\nYes! California law provides that when a grantor quitclaims their interest to another party, they transfers their entire interest including all the defects and equities which could then have been asserted against them.\n\nThis means that when the debtor quit claimed the property interest the person who took title obtained took it subject to the recorded lien and Child Support Services can still assert a support lien on that property. This frequently happens in divorce cases, where the child support payer quitclaims the property in dissolution of marriage to the former spouse, who takes the property subject to the support liens. If the escrow involves a property where quitclaim deeds have been filed, a name search will need to be performed for the grantor of the quitclaim to avoid problems and future litigation.\n\n10. Does a child support lien or abstract ever expire?\n\nNo, as long as the child support debt is owed the lien or abstract remains active. The California Civil Code exempts support judgments from renewal requirements and the support order or judgment is enforceable until paid in full. Title companies should not limit the number of years they research since there is a possibility that the client could have a child support obligation on adult children.\n\nMaking Child Support Payments\n\n1. What is the State Disbursement Unit (SDU)?\n\n“SDU” stands for the California State Disbursement Unit, which collects and distributes child support payments.\n\nThe SDU is not Child Support Services, and they can’t answer any questions about your case.

How do I get it released?\n\nYou must contact the child support agency handling your case. They can assist you in getting a license hold released\n\n17. My passport has a hold on it. Why? And how can I get it released?\n\nFederal law requires that a parent who owes past-due child support over $2,500 shall not be issued a passport. In California, you must bring your past-due balance to zero ($0.00) by paying it all off or having the case closed before your passport will be released. Contact the child support agency handling your case for questions about passport holds.\n\nWatch our Quick Tip video to learn more:\n\n18. If I go to jail, do I still have to pay child support?\n\nIf you go to jail, child support is still due, and interest will be charged on the amounts not paid.

Prior to obtaining the Terminated Income Withholding Order (FL-195) from the family court, the child must have reached the age of 18 and either has graduated from high school or has reached the age of 19, whichever comes first. Regardless, the courts may require proof to verify, such as the child’s birth certificate and/or diploma.\n\n3. Can an Income Withholding Order (FL-195) be terminated over the telephone?\n\nNo, a Terminated Income Withholding Order (FL-195) must be completed in person.

Where can I find information about the Parentage Opportunity Program?\n\nVisit CalParentage.org to learn about the Parentage Opportunity Program.\n\nMilitary and Veteran\n\n1. How will my child support order affect my Veteran Administration (VA) benefits\n\nVeteran’s disability benefits are considered income for calculating support; however, the benefits are predominantly non-taxable and not subject to wage withholding, meaning the payor must remit payment on their own.\n\n2. What are the differences in the types of payments made to Veterans by the military?\n\nMilitary Retired Pay\n\nPaid to the servicemember if they have certain eligibility requirements such as years of service (usually 20 with 10 “active” years). A servicemember can also be medically retired if they have a disability rating of at least 30% and they do not need to meet the “time served” requirements.\n\nPayments come from the military branch and not the VA, are generally taxable, and subject to enforcement via wage withholding.\n\nVA Disability Compensation (service-connected)\n\nPaid to a servicemember when their disability was incurred or aggravated during service\n\nGenerally exempt from taxation and not subject to wage withholding before payment to veteran\n\nPayments may be enforceable after they have been paid out to the servicemember\n\nServicemembers may apply for apportionment of those benefits for their spouse or dependents\n\nVA Disability Pension (non-service connected)\n\nPaid to a servicemember who has served during a period of war and is either\n\nPermanently and totally disabled from a non-service-connected disability and meets certain income requirements OR\n\nAge 65 or older\n\nExempt from taxes and not considered as income as is a needs-based benefit\n\nNot enforceable before or after payment\n\n3. What if I waived my military retirement pay in exchange for an equal amount of service-connect disability benefits?\n\nAs a general practice, if a veteran is eligible to receive both military retired pay and service-connected disability, a veteran may elect to waive all or a portion of taxable military retired pay in exchange for an equal amount of non-taxable, service-connected disability compensation. The waived amount is subject to wage withholding but if there is additional disability compensation, it is not enforceable via levy, seizure, or wage withholding before or after payment.\n\n4. How does apportionment of a veteran’s disability award work?\n\nAll or part of a veteran’s disability award may be apportioned (paid) to the veteran’s spouse, child, or dependent parent. A surviving spouse’s award may also be apportioned for the veteran’s child or children. Apportionment happens via application by the veteran, spouse, or dependent parent. The apportioned benefits that are paid to the custodian on behalf of the child may be credited against child support obligations or arrears. Similarly, a servicemember’s child may also be eligible to receive derivative benefits from their parent’s benefit. Servicemembers should contact their local VA for further information.\n\n5. Who should I contact about my VA benefits?\n\nShould a servicemember have additional questions about their VA benefits or eligibility to receive VA benefits, they should contact their local VA office. However, if a servicemember has any questions about their benefit and enforcement of their child support case especially if they are experiencing hardships as a result of a child support obligation, that individual should contact their local child support agency and speak to a caseworker immediately.\n\n6. Can my child support order be adjusted because of my VA benefits?\n\nIn certain scenarios the local child support agency can review the child support order for modification, the servicemember may be eligible for compromise of arrears owed to the state, or the case may be reviewed for closure depending on the disability and income status of the servicemember.\n\nTribal Relations\n\n1. My child is (partially) Native American. Can California Child Support Services help me get and/or enforce a legal order for support?\n\nNative American tribes are sovereign nations and have sovereign authority over their people and their territory, which gives them the right to make and obey their own laws. Court rulings concerning access to tribal lands and child support matters are included. While California Child Support Services does have a relationship with certain tribes and is working to connect with others, there are other tribes that will not allow service of legal documents or enforcement of an order if the parent lives on tribal lands. However, California Child Support Services will engage with all parents who should be paying support and attempt to get an appropriate order and enforce on behalf of the person receiving support. For more information about tribal nations, visit the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) website.\n\n2. California Child Support Services helped me open a case against my child’s parent (who lives on tribal lands). Why are they having trouble serving the documents and/or enforcing on my child’s behalf?\n\nTribal sovereignty allows tribes to decide what can and cannot occur on tribal lands. Speak with your caseworker to determine if other options may be available.\n\n3. California Child Support Services helped me open a case against the other parent (who resides and works on tribal lands). Why are they having trouble enforcing the court order on my child’s behalf?\n\nSome tribes work together with California Child Support Services and allow wage withholding when the employer is tribal. Other tribes do not. However, tribes are within their legal and sovereign rights to choose to withhold against a tribal member. If the tribal member is not employed by the tribe, their employer is legally obligated to withhold based on the existing court order.\n\nCustomer Relations\n\n1.
