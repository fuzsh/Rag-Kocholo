        "text": "From Jubilee to Sunday Lunch, we take a look at the life and times of Toyah Willcox.\n\nToyah Willcox has been enjoying a resurgence in recent years, and not just because of her continued touring, recording comeback and TV appearances.\n\nHer eye-popping Sunday Lunch appearances kept us entertained through lockdown and beyond, and classic indie label Cherry Red has been releasing wonderful deluxe editions of her early albums to remind us why we fell in love with her way back when.\n\nToyah Willcox and Robert Fripp's 10 best Sunday Lunch performance videos\n\nToyah Willcox reveals key to 38-year marriage with Robert Fripp and why they had no children\n\nListen to the Gold 70s Live Playlist on Global Player, the official Gold app\n\nSo it's a great time to take a look back at all things Toyah, and celebrate a unique figure in popular culture.\n\nIs Toyah a person, or a band? Who is her famous husband? And why was her second memoir so very controversial?\n\nRead on for anything you might want to know about Toyah Willcox.\n\nWhen was Toyah Willcox born and where did she grow up?\n\nToyah Willcox was born on May 18, 1958, in Kings Heath, Birmingham. She celebrated her 66th birthday in 2024.\n\nHer dad Beric Willcox was a factory owner in the joinery business, and her mum Barbara Joy was a professional dancer.\n\nToyah was the first person awarded a star on the Kings Heath Walk of Fame in 2012.\n\nShe went to Edgbaston College but got just one O level... in music. Toyah later went to Birmingham's Old Rep Drama School.\n\nAsked by Paul Morley 1980 if she was a \"problem child\", she replied: \"I was a f**king bitch. I used to be so quiet and then I just lashed out at something and when I lashed out I physically hurt someone.\n\n\"I used to sit there and then explode and people could never make me out. One minute I'd be all demure and the next minute I'd be holding them up against a wall smashing their faces in.\n\n\"I had total lack of control. I couldn't control my temper. If I didn't want to go to school, I wouldn't go to school. I had to be physically locked in my mother's car in the morning and driven to school. To me school was just one long prison sentence. I really hated it.\"\n\nIt's a good job she found an outlet in acting and music, then.\n\nWhere did Toyah's unusual name come from?\n\nToyah is a great-sounding bandname, and when she later formed her new wave group, it was named after her.\n\nIt's also actually Toyah's real name.\n\nHer older siblings were called... Nicola and Kim. So how did Toyah end up with such an unusual name and where did it come from?\n\nWell, there is a place in Texas called Toyah, which itself takes its name from the Native American word for \"flowing water\" – though there's no evidence that's where she got her name from at all.\n\nHow did Toyah get into showbusiness?\n\nToyah's first showbiz-adjacent jobs were as a dresser in Birmingham theatres The Alexandra and Hippodrome.\n\nHer first real splash in the industry was playing Sue in the BBC Second City Firsts series play Glitter in 1976, where she starred opposite Noel Edmonds and Phil Daniels. Toyah apparently won the role by singing David Bowie's 'Life on Mars?' – \"dreadfully\" in her words.\n\nThat part led to her work at the National Theatre in London, playing Emma in Tales from the Vienna Woods, directed by Maximilian Schell.\n\nToyah was then introduced to director Derek Jarman, who cast her as Mad in punk landmark Jubilee. Two years later, she went on to play Monkey in Franc Roddam's 1979 adaptation of The Who's Quadrophenia.\n\nWhen and how did Toyah get into the music industry?\n\nToyah's parts in Jubilee and Quadrophenia were music adjacent, but it was actually back in her first major role in Glitter that the seeds of Willcox's musical future were sown.\n\nThe 30-minute TV play featured the songs 'Dream Maker' and 'Floating Free', both co-written by Toyah herself. The latter boasted Phil Daniels on acoustic guitar.\n\nThat experience led her to form the band Toyah. She sang, of course, and the band was rounded out by Joel Bogen on guitar, Mark Henry on bass, Steve Bray on drums and Peter Bush on keyboards.\n\n\"All my life I had wanted to sing,\" Toyah said of her experience on Glitter. \"This was my chance.\n\n\"In the play I had to sing with the band, Bilbo Baggins. inspired by the band, the equipment, the volume, the ambience... my mind was set. I had to put a band together myself, or get into one... quick!\"\n\nThat first Toyah lineup only lasted a couple of albums before it fell apart in recrimination, with only Joel Bogen sticking around for the next three records\n\nWillcox went solo, still billed mononymously as Toyah, in 1985.\n\nWhat are Toyah's biggest songs?\n\nBoth with her band and as a solo star, Toyah racked up the hits in the 1970s, '80s and beyond – first on the indie charts, then on the main top 40 too.\n\nToyah's biggest songs from across her career include:\n\nVictims of the Riddle\n\nBird in Flight\n\nIeya\n\nDanced\n\nI Want to Be Free\n\nThunder in the Mountains\n\nBrave New World\n\nBe Proud Be Loud (Be Heard)\n\nRebel Run\n\nThe Vow\n\nDon't Fall in Love (I Said)\n\nLatex Messiah (Viva la Rebel in You)\n\nLevitate\n\nWhat are Toyah's biggest acting roles?\n\nEven after she broke through in music, Toyah continued to act on stage, on the big screen and on the small screen.\n\nShe has RANGE, playing everything from the narrator on Teletubbies to the mum on Secret Diary of a Call Girl, and everything inbetween,\n\nThese are her biggest theatre, cinema and TV roles from across her career:\n\nJubilee\n\nThe Corn Is Green\n\nTales from the Vienna Woods\n\nThe Tempest\n\nQuadrophenia\n\nUrgh! A Music War\n\nMurder: Ultimate Grounds for Divorce\n\nThe Ebony Tower\n\nAnchoress\n\nThe Most Fertile Man in Ireland\n\nAaaaaaaah!\n\nInvasion Planet Earth\n\nGive Them Wings\n\nSecond City Firsts: Glitter\n\nThe Quatermass Conclusion as Sal\n\nShoestring\n\nMinder\n\nTales of the Unexpected\n\nThe Ink Thief\n\nTeletubbies\n\nSecret Diary of a Call Girl\n\nDoctors\n\nIs Toyah Willcox married and does she have any children?\n\nToyah has been married to fellow musician Robert Fripp since 1986.\n\nYou'll know Robert Fripp as the founder and guitarist of King Crimson, as well as for his work with new wave icons like Blondie, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads and David Sylvain.\n\nFripp is also famed for his work with David Bowie – especially on \"Heroes\".\n\nThe couple don't have any kids, but they have arranged to leave their estates to establish a musical educational trust for children.\n\nWhy was Toyah's second memoir so controversial?\n\nThroughout her career, Toyah has been known – and applauded – for her outspoken honesty.\n\nShe recounted her remarkable life in her autobiography Living Out Loud in 2000, but it was her second book, 2005's Diary of a Facelift, which really grabbed the headlines.\n\nStung by unkind comments about her appearance when she appeared on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, she decided to progress from what had been regular botox injections to a full on facelift.\n\nShe recounted both the grisly details of the surgery and her reasons for undergoing it in her book.\n\nToyah was criticised by some for her supposedly antifeminist decision to go under the knife, but the bestseller was also applauded for its rare honesty and insight.\n\nWhat is Toyah's Sunday Lunch series all about?\n\nAs well as her recent tours (The Posh Pop Tour in 2021-22, the Electric Ladies jaunt with Lene Lovich in 2022) and her 21st-century albums Velvet Lined Shell, In the Court of the Crimson Queen and Posh Pop, Toyah has been filling our weekends with her distinct musical style.\n\nTogether with her husband Robert Fripp, every Sunday Toyah presents her Sunday Lunch covers on her YouTube channel.\n\nAs well as Toyah's classic vocal stylings and Rob's guitar frippery, there's also the gang's fantabulous outfits that makes every single performance feel like an event.\n\nThe series started as something to get us through Lockdown 1, but has proved so popular that it's continued since and even spawned 2023's Sunday Lunch with Robert Fripp live tour."
