        "text": "Before filing for divorce here, make sure Washington has jurisdiction over your children. If not, you cannot ask for a parenting plan or custody order here. You may need to file in another state.\n\nJurisdiction is complicated. If you have questions about whether Washington has jurisdiction over your children, talk with a lawyer as soon as possible. If you have a low income and live outside King County, call CLEAR at 1-888-201-1014.\n\nYou must wait at least 90 days after filing and serving the petition before entering final orders. If you and your spouse have an agreement, you can enter final orders right after the 90-day period. Divorces can take longer than 90 days if you cannot agree. If you cannot come to an agreement, your case will go to trial.\n\n*In most counties, you ask for a trial date after your spouse has filed a response.\n\nHow long it takes to finalize also depends on your county and how complicated your case is. If are claims of domestic violence, child abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, or other things that could be dangerous to the children, or you have complicated property issues, your case could take much longer.\n\nIt is best to try to come to an agreement if possible. Trials can be complicated. You may need a lawyer.\n\nYou may want Temporary Family Law Orders. The court enters these quickly. They can last until trial or the end of your case.\n\nExample 1: You want a parenting plan before trial saying who has custody and how much visitation the other parent will have.\n\nExample 2: You want an order keeping your spouse from cleaning out the bank accounts or selling things before trial.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\nAre you happy with how things are right now without them?\n\nDo you need an order making your spouse do (or stop doing) something?\n\nTemporary orders can include:\n\nA parenting plan saying whom the children will live with until the divorce is final. Until you have an order, each parent has an equal right to custody. If your spouse will not let you see the children, a parenting plan can give you visitation.\n\nRestraining orders to keep one spouse from harassing or coming near the other.\n\nRestraining orders keeping a spouse from taking the children out of state.\n\nRestraining orders keeping a spouse from getting rid of property, taking out loans in both your names, or taking your name off insurance policies.\n\nOrders for temporary child support, maintenance (alimony), attorney’s fees, or use of your house or car.\n\nOrder that one spouse can live in the house and the other cannot.\n\nAppointment of a guardian ad litem (GAL) or parenting evaluator. Read Guardian ad Litems in Family Law Cases.\n\nIf there is an emergency, you may need an Immediate Restraining Order right away. The judge often enters this without giving the other spouse any notice, or very little notice. (The other spouse later can have a hearing. The judge decides there if the order will continue.)\n\nYou may need this order if you cannot wait one to three weeks for a hearing to get help from the court. Examples: Your spouse\n\nIs harassing or harming you.\n\nHas harmed the children OR poses a danger to them.\n\nHas threatened to take the children.\n\nIs taking a lot out of your accounts, or selling or hiding property.\n\nIf you file for Immediate Restraining Orders, you do not need to file for Temporary Orders.\n\nIf you are afraid that your spouse may hurt or threaten you or the children, the court can issue special orders to help protect you. If you have been a domestic violence victim, or your spouse has threatened you, you can ask for a Domestic Violence Protection Order anytime. You can also ask for a permanent protection order as part of the final divorce orders.\n\nA Domestic Violence Protection Order can:\n\nGive you custody.\n\nSet up visitation for your spouse, OR stop your spouse from seeing the children.\n\nKeep your spouse out of the home and away from your home, work, or school.\n\nOrder your spouse not to threaten, assault, harass, or stalk you.\n\nOrder your spouse to get domestic violence and/or alcohol or drug treatment.\n\nOrder your spouse to turn their gun in to law enforcement.\n\nFor more about Protection Orders, contact your court’s protection order advocates or local domestic violence program, or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline 1.800.799.7233. Protection order forms are available from the court clerk or your local domestic violence program. You can also use our do-it-yourself interview program, Washington Forms Online, to fill out the forms at WashingtonLawHelp.org.\n\nYou must tell the court about all your property and debts. Washington is a community property state. Generally, all property (house, other real estate, car) a spouse gets during the marriage is community property. It belongs to both of you, even if only one of you is on the title. Each spouse’s earnings during the marriage is community property.\n\nYour Divorce Petition proposes how the court should divide the property and debts. The court in the Final Divorce Order decides who gets what.\n\nSeparate property belongs to only one spouse. Generally, it is property you got before the marriage through inheritance or as a gift (before or during the marriage), or after separation.\n\n*If you lived together before your marriage, property and earnings you had while living together might also be community property. Talk to a lawyer.\n\nGenerally, all debts either spouse incurred during the marriage are community debts. Both spouses are equally responsible for them.\n\nYou incur separate debts before the marriage or after separation.\n\nThe law about division of property in divorces can be complicated. Talk to a lawyer.\n\nIt will depend. If you have children, the court looks at who gets custody. The court will probably let the parent with custody keep living in the family home, if possible. The court may award that parent more property and fewer debts, especially if the other spouse cannot pay much child support.\n\nThe court will also consider what condition property and debt division will leave you each in post-divorce. It generally does not want one spouse very wealthy and the other poor. It will consider your\n\nAge.\n\nHealth.\n\nEducation.\n\nWork prospects.\n\nExample 1: You had a long marriage. You have not worked much outside the home. The court may award you more community property (or long-term maintenance) so you do not end up much poorer than your spouse is.\n\nExample 2: You have a disability. You cannot work. The court may award you more community property.\n\nExample 3: The court can consider which spouse will be able to afford to pay the debts when deciding who must pay them.\n\nIn most cases, the court will award each spouse their separate property and order each to pay their separate debts. It rarely awards one spouse’s separate property or debts to the other.\n\nYou may have signed a written agreement before marrying stating how you would divide your property and debts if you divorced. We often call this a prenuptial agreement.\n\nYou may have signed an agreement during the marriage stating which of your property is community and separate. We call this a Community Property Agreement. Couples sometimes do these as part of an estate plan.\n\nYou might have signed an agreement after separation dividing property and debts. We call this a Property Settlement Agreement or Separation Contract.\n\nIf you think you have any written agreement about your property and debts, have a lawyer look at it. This might determine how the court will divide property and debts in your case.\n\nMaybe. The court might award you an interest in the house.\n\nThe house is your spouse’s separate property. They bought it before your marriage. It remains separate after you marry UNLESS your spouse gives it as a gift to the community. This could happen if, for example, you refinance it in both names.\n\nYou may be entitled to an interest in any increase in the house’s value from improvements you made to the house (such as a remodel or new deck) during the marriage, plus the community payments on the mortgage. The court would subtract the house’s reasonable rental value from your community interest because you benefited from living there during the marriage. It could rule you have no community interest in the house because of the value you got from living there.\n\n*This issue is complicated. Talk to a lawyer.\n\nLook at\n\nThe home’s value.\n\nWhat you still owe on it.\n\nYour post-divorce incomes.\n\nExample: can just one of you pay the mortgage? If not, awarding one of you the property may lead to foreclosure and damage your credit. It might be safer to sell it.\n\nDo not create a post-divorce situation where title is in one name, the debt in another. Example: The divorce court awards you title to the home. No one takes action to make this official. Your spouse’s name stays on the mortgage. Your spouse falls behind on payments. It will then be very hard to get the lender to give you a modification with your spouse’s name still on the mortgage. To avoid problems, you must refinance the property in one spouse’s name at/near the time of the divorce.\n\n*These are important, often complex, considerations. Talk to an experienced lawyer.\n\nMaybe. Maintenance (alimony) is a payment one spouse makes to the other for financial support. The court does not always award maintenance. It must look at things such as:\n\nHow long you have been married.\n\nBoth your financial situations, given the division of property and debts and your spouse’s ability to pay maintenance.\n\nTime it will take for you to get education or training.\n\nStandard of living during the marriage.\n\nYour age and health.\n\nIf you have been unemployed a long time (example: you stayed home to care for the children), you are more likely to get maintenance than if you have been laid off temporarily. On the other hand, you can get maintenance even if you are working, if the court decides you should enjoy the same standard of living you had during the marriage. You are more likely to get maintenance if both of these are true:\n\nYou were married many years.\n\n*Maintenance is complicated. Try to talk to a lawyer.\n\nYou have a disability and/or stayed home to care for the children while your spouse worked. You are less likely to get a good job now.\n\nMaintenance payments generally end when you remarry or die. The Final Divorce Order may say otherwise.\n\nA parenting plan signed by a judge or court commissioner is a court order. You both must follow it. If you do not, the court could hold you in contempt. You might face criminal charges.\n\nYou must have a good excuse not to follow a parenting plan. Example: following it would cause serious harm to you or the child. Even then, you cannot just stop following it. You must go back to court to ask to change it. Do this as soon as you can. Then the court can approve a new, more appropriate schedule. Read Change a Parenting Plan/Child Custody Order.\n\nIf you believe your child may be in danger, you can contact Child Protective Services (CPS).\n\n*If you do not want to follow part of a court-ordered parenting plan, get the other parent’s permission in writing OR contact a lawyer.\n\nIt must consider:\n\n1. Reasons to restrict one parent’s time with the children\n\nThe court must first decide if there is any reason under RCW 26.09.191 to limit a parent’s time/contact with the children. In most cases, the court must limit a parent’s time if that parent, or someone living with him/her, has engaged in any of these:\n\nLong-time willful abandonment of or refusal to care for the children.\n\nPhysical/sexual/emotional abuse of any child.\n\nA history of domestic violence or an assault or sexual assault that causes serious bodily harm or the fear it.\n\nHas a conviction as an adult of certain sex crimes with a child victim, or has been found to be a sexual predator.\n\nThe court may choose to limit a parent’s time with the child if it finds any of these:\n\nThe parent neglected or substantially failed to provide care for the children.\n\nThe parent has a long-term emotional/physical problem interfering with their ability to take care of the children.\n\nThe parent has a long-term drug, alcohol, or other substance abuse problem interfering with their ability to take care of the children.\n\nThere is no bond or a seriously damaged bond between parent/child.\n\nThat parent has engaged in the abusive use of conflict, creating a danger of serious damage to the child’s psychological development.\n\nThe parent has kept the child from the other parent for a long time for no good reason.\n\nThere is another reason unrestricted contact would be bad for the child.\n\n2. Limiting a parent’s time if there is a reason to under RCW 26.09.191\n\nIt depends. In most cases, the court will not let this parent have custody. In very serious cases, it must order no contact between parent/child.\n\n*The court must follow very detailed rules if a parent or someone living with them has a conviction for a sex crime against children or been found to have molested/harmed children in a civil case. Courts rarely allow that parent unsupervised contact with their child. If you or your spouse has a conviction for such a crime, talk to a lawyer.\n\nThe court may order any restriction reasonably calculated to protect the child OR a parent from abuse/harm that could come from contact with the other parent. Restrictions can include requiring a parent to:\n\nSee the children only when supervised.\n\nComplete domestic violence or substance abuse treatment.\n\nTake random drug/alcohol tests.\n\nComplete a parenting class.\n\nGo to counseling or take medication for a mental health condition.\n\nComplete a sexual deviancy evaluation.\n\nStop interfering with the other parent’s contact with the children.\n\nStop creating conflict with the other parent without good reason.\n\n3. None of RCW 26.09.191 applies. How will the court decide custody?\n\nThe court must encourage each parent’s relationship with the child, consistent with the family’s social/economic circumstances. The court must consider:\n\nThe relative strength/nature/stability of the child’s relationship with each parent.\n\nThe parents’ agreements, if you entered them knowingly and voluntarily.\n\nEach parent’s past/future potential for taking care of the children, including if one of you has taken more daily responsibility.\n\nThe child’s emotional needs and developmental level.\n\nThe child’s relationship with siblings and other important adults, and involvement with school/activities/community.\n\nYour wishes.\n\nThe child’s wishes, if mature enough to say. (This usually means a teenager.)\n\nEach parent’s work schedule.\n\nThe court should not give much weight to:\n\nWhich parent earns more, or is remarrying.\n\nWhen deciding a permanent parenting plan, what the temporary parenting plan says.\n\nRCW 26.09.187.\n\n4. Will the court order equal time with the children?\n\nOnly if it finds it is in the child’s best interests. How close the ex-spouses live to each other may matter.\n\nEither parent can make emergency OR day-to-day decisions (examples: what the child will eat; who will babysit the child) when the child is in that parent’s care. The court may let or both parents make non-emergency decisions, such as where the child will go to school, what health care providers the child will see, when the child gets medical care, and what religious institution the child attends.\n\nThe court must give only one parent the authority to make these decisions if there is a limiting factor under RCW 26.09.191 against the other parent OR the parents do not want to decide together. If one parent disagrees with joint decision-making, the court may order one parent sole decision-making if any of these is true:\n\nRCW 26.09.191 applies to the other parent.\n\nThe other parent has never taken part in decision-making about the children.\n\nThe parents cannot and do not want to cooperate.\n\nThe parents do not live close enough to each other.\n\nIn most cases, the court should treat decisions about the children’s religious upbringing differently from school and medical care decisions. The court should allow each parent to provide the child the religious instruction of the parent’s choice while in that parent’s care, unless the court decides that exposure to those religious views will harm the children.\n\nThe parenting plan has a section saying how you will solve future disagreements about it. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) refers to ways of solving disagreements besides going to court. You can choose counseling, mediation, or arbitration. The court should not order ADR if any of these is true:\n\nRCW 26.09.191 applies to one parent.\n\nThe parents cannot take part in ADR equally.\n\nOne parent cannot afford ADR.\n\nIn any of those cases, the parenting plan should just require you to go back to court over any disagreements about the parenting plan.\n\nIf you choose counseling, you typically meet with a mental health professional who uses counseling techniques to help you solve your disagreement. If you choose mediation, you meet with a neutral third party who may be a lawyer, retired judge, or mental health professional. That mediator tries to encourage you to come to agreement. If you choose an arbitrator, you meet with a neutral third party (often a lawyer or retired judge) who tries to help you reach agreement, but who makes a decision you both must follow if you cannot agree. You can file a motion asking for a review of the arbitrator’s decision if you do not agree with it.\n\nIn most cases, you must pay for ADR. It can cost a lot. However, ADR can also help you avoid the stress/expense/unpredictability of going to court. Some people find ADR helpful.\n\n*Mediation: Should I Use Ithas more info.\n\nIt is what one parent pays the other to help support the children. You usually must pay child support monthly. The court bases the amount on the Washington State Support Schedule. The court also considers\n\nThe children's needs.\n\nBoth parents' incomes.\n\nParents have a legal duty to help support their children. In most divorce cases, the non-custodial parent pays the other parent child support. Even if the parents split custody evenly, one may have to pay support if there is a big difference in their incomes.\n\n*A stepparent may have a legal duty to help support stepchildren until a divorce from the child’s parent is final or the court ends this obligation.\n\nThe court uses the Washington State Child Support Schedule. It works like an income tax table. The court figures out each parent’s income, adds it together, and finds the amount of support on the Schedule that applies to the number and ages of children.\n\nThe court’s main concern is making sure your children have enough to meet their needs. Support is for clothes and food, to give the children a place to live (rent, mortgage, utilities), and assure they have decent daycare and medical care.\n\nYou both may have to share costs for uninsured health care, daycare, school tuition, and long-distance visits. The court determines how much each parent pays in proportion to their incomes and by considering the number of children living with them. The court may award the federal income tax exemptions each spouse is entitled to claim.\n\n*How is Child Support Set has more info.\n\nYes!\n\nWe have printable packets with blank forms for you to print and fill out on your own, with how-to instructions for completing and filing.\n\nCheck the list below to see what is available. This list should help you decide which you need. You may need more than one. Get only what you need when you need them.\n\nFile for Divorce – Use this to start a divorce.\n\nAsk the Court to Waive Your Filing Fee – Use this to ask the court to waive (not ask for) the filing fee required to file court papers in a civil case because you cannot afford to pay it. Or use our do-it-yourself interview program, Washington Forms Online, to complete the forms at WashingtonLawHelp.org.\n\nMake a Parenting Plan –You have children together.\n\nChild Support Worksheets and Order –to ask for child support.\n\nAsk for Temporary Family Law Orders: Divorce Cases and Petition to Change Parenting Plan Cases –to ask for a court order covering any period between the date you file for divorce and the date it is final.\n\nAsk for Immediate Restraining Orders: Divorce Cases and Petition to Change Parenting Plan Cases – to ask for an emergency order to take effect immediately.\n\nRespond to Motions for Temporary Family Law Orders or Immediate Restraining Orders in a Family Law Case –Your spouse has filed for Temporary Family Law Orders or Immediate Restraining Order.\n\nFinalize a Divorce by Default– You are ready to finalize. Your spouse has not responded.\n\nFinalize a Divorce with Children by Agreement – when you and your spouse have an agreement (settlement).\n\nService by Certified Mail or Publication –You have tried to serve your spouse in person, but could not.

At least one of the children get welfare benefits such as TANF, food stamps, or medical benefits. You must serve a copy of your legal papers on the State of Washington, care of the prosecuting attorney’s office.\n\nDismiss a Divorce –You do not want to end your marriage after all.\n\nOther: Local Do-it-Yourself packets: Local court rules may require you to use their forms or packets. Ask the court clerk or facilitator in your county.\n\nHire a lawyer to represent you. If you can afford to, you should talk to one about your case and consider hiring them to file for you. If you cannot afford a lawyer, contact your local legal services office. Some legal services offices, county bar associations, and pro bono programs handle divorces. They usually can directly represent only a very few people. If you have a low income and live outside King County, call CLEAR for a referral at 1-888-201-1014. If you have a low income and live in King County, call the King County Bar Association at (206) 623-2551. Ask for a referral for low-income representation in family law.\n\nTake a “Self-Help” class. Some counties have classes on how to file your own divorce. It may cost more than this packet, but may give more help with forms and local procedures. If you can go to a class, you should. To find out if your county has a self-help class, contact your local family law facilitator, if there is one.\n\nWhere available, use the local family law facilitator’s Do-It-Yourself packets. Some counties have family law facilitators who can help you file your own divorce. They are not lawyers. They cannot give legal advice. They do often have do-it-yourself packets designed for that county."
