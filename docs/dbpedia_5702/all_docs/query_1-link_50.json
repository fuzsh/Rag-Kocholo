        "text": "“\n\nPop hits from the 80s, 90s, Noughties, and today.\n\n— GTA V Website\n\nNon-Stop-Pop is a radio station in Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online that plays modern pop and dance music.\n\nDescription[]\n\nThe station is hosted by British model Cara Delevingne. It functions similarly to Lips 106 from GTA III, serving as a contemporary pop mix station containing songs of various popular genres dating from the 1980s to the early 2010s. Cara presents an innocent and bubbly personality on-air, actively encouraging fun and positivity while mocking depressed and uptight people (who she calls \"wankers\"), asserting she knows they secretly love the music. As with most things, she doesn't seem to take her job very seriously, occasionally going on Bleeter or playing Righteous Slaughter 7 on air, though she does seem knowledgable of the music she plays, giving brief descriptions of the songs and their history. She also comments on the cynical state of society in Los Santos.\n\nThis is one of the preferred stations of Tracey De Santa, Josh Bernstein, and Tao Cheng.\n\nTracklist[]\n\nSong: Preview: Notes: \"Pure Shores\" by All Saints (2000) \"1 Thing\" by Amerie (2005) \"Gimme More\" by Britney Spears (2007) \"The Rhythm of the Night (Rapino Bros. 7\" Single)\" by Corona (1993) \"Glamorous\" by Fergie feat.

That version of the station reused the DJ lines from Radio Broker as a placeholder.[22][23] It is possible that the following songs were included in this iteration of the station:\n\nDuran Duran - Serious (1990)\n\nTears For Fears - Everybody Wants to Rule the World (1985)\n\nOlivia Newton-John - Physical (1981)\n\nRufus & Chaka Khan - Ain't Nobody (1983)\n\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay[]\n\nRadio station[]\n\nPonsonbys\n\nBob Mulét\n\nLTD Gasoline (Davis branch)\n\nS. Ho Korean Noodle House\n\nAl Dente's (Burton and Del Perro branches)\n\nThe Diamond Casino & Resort (GTA Online)\n\nHaute\n\nIndividual Tracks[]\n\nSongs from this station play inside the Vanilla Unicorn:\n\nAmerie - 1 Thing\n\nBritney Spears - Gimme More\n\nFergie feat. Ludacris - Glamorous\n\nKelly Rowland - Work (Freemasons Remix)\n\nMis-Teeq - Scandalous\n\nPet Shop Boys - West End Girls\n\nThe enhanced version adds more songs to the Vanilla Unicorn playlist, in addition to the ones already in the original version:\n\nLady Gaga - Applause\n\nM.I.A. - Bad Girls\n\nMike Posner - Cooler Than Me\n\n\"Work (Freemasons remix)\" by Kelly Rowland appears to be playing inside the Dignity during the mission Daddy's Little Girl. It also plays during Pack Man after Franklin Clinton escapes from the police.\n\n\"Let's Go All the Way\" by Sly Fox was featured in the Official PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Launch Trailer.\n\n\"Everything She Wants\" by Wham! was featured in the GTA Online: Executives and Other Criminals Trailer.\n\nThe extended version of \"Everything She Wants\" (running to 6:30 and featuring an extended bridge) is used in the trailer, whereas the version featured in game is the original album version (5:01).\n\n\"Anthem\" by N-Joi was featured in the Tiny Racers Trailer for GTA Online.\n\n\"Don't Wanna Fall In Love\" by Jane Child, \"Only Girl (In The World)\" by Rihanna and \"Music Sounds Better With You\" by Stardust are featured as promotional tracks for the station on the Grand Theft Auto V website.\n\nScandalous by Mis-Teeq plays in Vanilla Unicorn in the finale of The Humane Labs Raid in GTA Online. (PS3 and Xbox 360 only).\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\n\"Me & U\" by Cassie was removed from the final version of a GTA soundtrack twice, from The Vibe 98.8 in GTA IV and Non-Stop-Pop in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game. It was then added to the station in the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC versions of GTA V.\n\nDuring one of Cara's monologues, she utters the line \"Everything doesn't have to be so serious!\". This likely was a splice taken from the introduction line for Duran Duran's deleted 1990 track \"Serious\", its chorus of \"Does it have to be serious?\" likely being referred to. In addition, the waveform of the line's audio suggests a splice was made.\n\nAnother monologue might have taken a splice from one of the Duran Duran intros, in particular, the monologue where Cara says \"Non Stop Pop FM is less serious, and is actually about having fun!\". In between the line \"Non Stop Pop FM\" and \"is less serious, and is actually about having fun!\", Cara's voice instantly and crudely changes pitch, indicating it being a splice from a different audio file.\n\nFollowing the Heists update, \"Tape Loop\" by Morcheeba was changed to the \"Shortcheeba Mix\" version on the console versions of the game. The original version remained on the PC version until it was also replaced by the \"Shortcheeba Mix\" in The Diamond Casino & Resort update (Title Update 1.48).\n\nThe original version of the song can still be heard within The Diamond Casino & Resort.\n\nIn the in-game files, there are two intros with Cara introducing the song \"Circle in the Sand\" by Belinda Carlisle, showing that the song was meant to appear on this station, but instead appeared on Los Santos Rock Radio in the final version.\n\nA cover of Wham!'s \"Everything She Wants\" is featured in IFruit Radio, specifically one recorded by the Egyptian Lover.\n\nGorillaz, whose song \"Feel Good Inc.\" is featured on this station, released a music video for \"The Valley of the Pagans\" in 2020 that featured footage filmed in GTA V's Director Mode.\n\nSee Also[]\n\nHead Radio - a pop and rock radio in Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto 2, GTA III and GTA Liberty City Stories.\n\nRise FM - a house radio in GTA III and GTA Liberty City Stories that plays other songs by Moloko and Sneaker Pimps.\n\nLips 106 - a Top 40 pop radio in GTA III and GTA Liberty City Stories.\n\nFlashback FM - an '80s pop radio in GTA III and '70s pop in GTA Liberty City Stories.\n\nFlash FM - an '80s pop radio in GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories which plays other songs by Hall & Oates and INXS.\n\nEmotion 98.3 - an '80s soft pop radio in GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories.\n\nWave 103 - an '80s new wave and synthpop radio in GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories.\n\nCSR 103.9 - a new jack swing and pop radio in GTA San Andreas which plays a song by Bobby Brown.\n\nThe Vibe 98.8 - an R&B radio in GTA IV that originally was going to feature Cassie's \"Me & U\".\n\nVladivostok FM - a radio in GTA IV and Episodes from Liberty City that in the latter plays house and electronic dance, as well as other songs with Freemasons and Kelly Rowland.\n\nVice City FM - an '80s pop radio in Episodes from Liberty City which plays a song by Hall & Oates.\n\nRadio Mirror Park - a contemporary new wave and synthpop radio in GTA V, mainly from indie artists.\n\nWorldWide FM - a radio in GTA V which plays another song by Jamiroquai.\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]"
