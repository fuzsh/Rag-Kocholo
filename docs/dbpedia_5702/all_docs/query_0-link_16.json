        "text": "International parental child abduction is when a child is removed from or retained outside of their country of habitual residence, and the removal or retention violates another parent or guardian’s custody rights. The Department of State’s Office of Children’s Issues is a leader in U.S. government efforts to prevent international parental child abduction. This includes abductions both from the United States and to the United States. The Office of Children’s Issues helps children and families in abduction cases. It also promotes the goals of the Hague Abduction Convention."
