Please view our advertising policy and product review methodology for more information.\n\nEditor's note: This post has been updated with the latest information.\n\n\"Mom, I think I'll have an easier time walking into summer camp if I don't have you there to bail me out.\"\n\nAnd with those wise and insightful words, my 11-year-old signed herself up for a flight as an unaccompanied minor from Houston to Philadelphia for her first stint at a two-week-long summer camp.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons why you may find yourself in a situation where your child needs to fly as an unaccompanied minor while you stay behind on the ground. That could include your child traveling to their other parent's house, visiting their grandparents or, in our case, heading to summer camp.\n\nMy first unaccompanied minor flight was at 5 years old and my eldest daughter's first unaccompanied minor flight was at the age of 6. While we don't use the airlines' unaccompanied minor services often, we do have some experience in this area.\n\nFor more TPG news and travel tips delivered each morning to your inbox, sign up for our free daily newsletter.\n\nAs a parent, I'll say it can be scary to have your kid flying miles above the ground without an adult, but it's also one of those situations where the more you -- and your kid -- know, the less intimidating it becomes. Here's what you need to know before using an airline's unaccompanied minor service.\n\nWhat is an unaccompanied minor?\n\nStarting when kids turn 5, you can pay a fee to many airlines to have your child registered as an unaccompanied minor so they can fly without an adult. In return for that fee, the airline provides the child some additional supervision, assistance getting on and off the plane, escort to any connections and assistance in the event of irregular operations.\n\nTypically, a parent or guardian will complete the paperwork and obtain the boarding pass at the check-in desk, obtain a gate pass, escort the child through security and then wait at the child's gate until their plane is in the air. On the other end, at arrival, a designated adult will go through roughly the same process and be waiting at the gate when the plane arrives.\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\n\nEmail address\n\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\nShould my child fly as an unaccompanied minor?\n\nSome parents balk at the notion of a child flying without them because of safety or logistical concerns, and those can certainly be very valid concerns. On the other hand, I know that the risks of regularly riding a school bus without me are probably much higher than the occasional commercial flight.\n\nRelated: Children ages 2 and up need face masks to fly\n\nThat said, I wouldn't rush down the unaccompanied minor path until both you and your child are ready. That may be at 6, 9 or 11 years old. However, if your child is 12 years old before the need arises for a solo flight, you may be shocked to find that some airlines won't provide unaccompanied minor services to children once they turn 12, even if you're willing to pay.\n\nWhile all airlines are different, I've never seen an area of family travel that varies as dramatically as the rules for unaccompanied minors.\n\nEven within the United States, some airlines don't accept unaccompanied minors at all; others require the service until a child is 14; and others don't offer it at all once a child turns 12. It's not just the ages that differ; the fees range widely from $50 to $150. And at least one airline provides the service for free ... as long as your child has elite status.\n\nSome airlines let you connect on international itineraries to other airlines and some only permit nonstop domestic flights. The rules and fees for unaccompanied minors are truly all over the place.\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAlaska Airlines unaccompanied minor policies and fees\n\nAlaska Airlines calls its program Junior Jetsetters, but has limited meals, so asks that caregivers pack meals and entertainment.\n\nFees are currently $50 per direction per child for nonstop or direct flights and $75 per direction per child for connecting flights.\n\nChildren ages 5 to 7 are considered unaccompanied minors and may only travel on nonstop or direct flights. Travel may not begin between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.\n\nChildren ages 8 to 12 are considered unaccompanied minors and may travel on a flight that requires a connection, but not with a layover of more than two hours or on the last flight of the day unless there is no other option. As with the younger age group, travel may not begin between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.\n\nChildren ages 13 to 17 may request the unaccompanied minor service (it is optional) and are subject to the same rules as children 8 to 12.\n\nUnaccompanied minor service fees are waived for children who have attained MVP, MVP Gold or Gold 75K Mileage Plan status.\n\nUnaccompanied minors are not accepted if weather or other factors are likely to interrupt the routine operation of their destination or connecting-point flights.\n\nChildren may not travel alone to or from Sun Valley, Idaho (SUN), between Dec. 1 and April 1.\n\nRelated: Why Alaska Airlines miles are the most valuable\n\nAllegiant Air\n\nAllegiant does not accept unaccompanied minors under the age of 15. Passengers 15 years or older are considered adults. Passengers younger than 15 years old must be accompanied by an adult who is ticketed on the same reservation.\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nAmerican Airlines unaccompanied minor policies and fees\n\nThe unaccompanied minor service fee is $150 (plus tax) each way, though this fee also includes siblings on the same flight.\n\nTravel is not permitted if it includes a connection to or from another airline (including partners), requires ground transportation/co-terminal connections, is the last flight of the day from the final connection city (unless that is the only option) or involves overnight connecting flights.\n\nChildren ages 5 to 7 can only travel on nonstop or direct flights. Children over 8 can connect through Charlotte (CLT), Washington, D.C. (DCA), Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), New York City (JFK and LGA), Los Angeles (LAX), Miami (MIA), Chicago (ORD), Philadelphia (PHL) and Phoenix (PHX).\n\nChildren ages 15 to 17 can travel as an unaccompanied minor, but it is not required.\n\nChildren ages 2 to 14 can travel as an \"accompanied minor\" with someone 16 years or older.\n\nReservations must be made over the phone at 1-800-433-7300.\n\nRelated: American Airlines miles no longer expire for children\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nDelta Air Lines unaccompanied minor policies and fees\n\nDelta charges $150 for each direction of travel, which covers up to four children.\n\nThe Delta unaccompanied minor program is required for all children ages 5 to 14 not traveling in the same compartment with an adult who is at least 18 years old or the child's parent/legal guardian. The program is optional for children ages 15 to 17.\n\nChildren ages 5 to 7 can only travel on nonstop flights. Children age 8 and older may travel on nonstop and some connecting flights.\n\nDomestic and international travel is permitted.\n\nTravel is not permitted on the last connecting flight of the day.\n\nTravel is not permitted on red-eye flights between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. unless it is an international flight, a domestic short-haul flight of two hours or less, a flight to/from Alaska and Hawaii or in a market with only one connection per day.\n\nReservations must be made over the phone at 1-800-325-8847.\n\nAll children will receive features like a trackable wristband, access to a Sky Zone lounge for kids and a Delta personnel escort for your child throughout their travel day.\n\nRelated: How to save money with the Delta companion certificate\n\nFrontier\n\nFrontier suspended its unaccompanied minor program in 2018. Children younger than 15 years old must travel on the same itinerary with another passenger who is at least 15 years old.\n\nHawaiian Airlines\n\nHawaiian Airlines unaccompanied minor policies and fees\n\nThe unaccompanied minor fee is $35 per segment within Hawaii and $100 per segment for flights between North America and Hawaii. The fee covers up to two children from one family.\n\nChildren who are 5 to 11 years old and traveling without a companion 15 years of age or older on the same domestic flight and in the same compartment are considered unaccompanied minors; for international flights, the travel companion must be at least 18 years of age.\n\nPassengers 12 years old and above may travel alone on domestic flights without the use of the unaccompanied minor program.\n\nUnaccompanied minors are not permitted on international flights.\n\nFees must be paid by a parent or responsible adult upon check-in.\n\nUnaccompanied minors are not permitted on flights departing between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. unless the flight operates out of Honolulu and is the only flight of the day. Travel is not permitted on the last connecting flight of the day or on connecting flights where the connection time is longer than two hours.\n\nTravel is not permitted on flights that require an overnight stay to make a connection, on any codeshare flights or those connecting to/from another carrier.\n\nWhether in advance or at check-in, if there's a possibility an unaccompanied child's flight may be delayed or there may be a missed connection, Hawaiian Airlines may change the child's flight schedule, including the departure date.\n\nUnaccompanied minors may travel in economy or first class.\n\nContact reservations to book an unaccompanied minor's flight at 1-800-367-5320.\n\nRelated: Flying Hawaiian Airlines first class with a family\n\nJetBlue\n\nJetBlue unaccompanied minor policies and fees\n\nThere is a $150 fee per direction of travel per person.\n\nChildren between the ages of 5 and 14 are considered unaccompanied minors. You can request additional assistance for children over 14 by calling 1-800-JETBLUE.\n\nA child as young as 2 may fly with a child who is at least 14 without unaccompanied minor status.\n\nTravel is only permitted on nonstop flights. Travel is not permitted on connecting or direct flights or in Mint seats. Flights may be domestic or international.\n\nEvery country requires special documentation, such as a notarized letter, stating that the unaccompanied minor has permission to fly alone. JetBlue recommends contacting the nearest embassy/consulate for more information.\n\nAt this time, unaccompanied minors are not able to travel on JetBlue flights to and from London.\n\nThere is a maximum of three unaccompanied minors per flight — book far in advance to ensure there's availability.\n\nUnaccompanied minors are seated in seats A, B and C in the last row of the aircraft. They may not fly in Mint or Even More Space seats.\n\nUnaccompanied minors are always allowed to bring a carry-on bag on board with them, even when booked on a Blue Basic fare.\n\nReservations can be made online.\n\nRelated: What it's like to fly JetBlue from NYC to Florida\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nSouthwest Airlines unaccompanied minor policies and fees\n\nSouthwest charges a $50 fee per direction of travel per child.\n\nChildren ages 5 to 11 traveling without an accompanying passenger age 12 or older are considered unaccompanied minors. Children 12 and over can use the airline's Young Travelers service that has no fee, but does allow for gate passes for adults escorting and picking up the child or children.\n\nThe unaccompanied minor service is only valid for travel on domestic nonstop or direct flights.

In terms of seating, I feel best when my child is seated as close to a flight attendant as possible, preferably at the front of the plane and in an aisle seat for maximum visibility. I would also avoid overnight or late-night flights where visibility and supervision are decreased.\n\nThere are some things airlines will let you do that I personally wouldn't outside of an emergency. For example, JetBlue allows children as young as 2 to fly with a 14 year old outside of the unaccompanied minor program. Kids age out of the unaccompanied minor program at Southwest when they turn 12, which is probably great news for some, but perhaps not for others. I do love that Alaska Airlines provides free unaccompanied minor services to its elite flying children, and I appreciate that many airlines, even the low-cost carriers, provide a snack and drink to their young, unaccompanied flyers.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is up to the parents to decide what their child can handle, even if the airlines have rules that permit flights and connections beyond those limits.\n\nFeatured image by Getty Images\n\nEditorial disclaimer: Opinions expressed here are the author’s alone, not those of any bank, credit card issuer, airline or hotel chain, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities."
