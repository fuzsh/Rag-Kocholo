        "text": "There is no perfect parent standard\n\nWhat if the mother believes the father does not have her level of parenting skills? However, the father is otherwise capable of caring for the child without endangering the child. Is the mother's basis to stop a child from seeing the other parent unjustified? Yes, it is.\n\nThrough our extensive experience in child custody cases, we could probably give you over 50 examples of justified, protective gate-keeping and 50 more that were not.\n\nJustification however still does not give a parent a legal basis to stop the child from seeing the other parent. The concerned parent should immediately seek appropriate child custody and visitation orders and bring his or her concerns to the court's attention.\n\nThe parent whose contact is unreasonably prevented or limited should not stand idly by and do nothing. If he or she does nothing, the parent may establish a status quo. The status quo may make it more difficult for the court to change it in the short term.\n\nThat parent should also seek immediate child custody and visitation orders.\n\nWhat is a restrictive gate-keeper?\n\nA restrictive gate-keeper is a parent who without justification prevents the child from seeing the other parent. The parent is usually scorned about the breakup and seeks his or her revenge by using a child as leverage to hurt the other parent.\n\nThis type of restrictive parent may also make false allegations of abuse or neglect against the other parent.\n\nRestrictive gate-keepers are not necessarily terrible parents.\n\nDespite their parenting skills, they have little respect for the other parent's role in the child's life.\n\nSuch parents engage in disparagement of the other parent or the other parent's family or friends to the child.\n\nSometimes they do this directly to the child.\n\nSometimes they ensure the child sees or overhears communication intended to disparage.\n\nThey rarely co-parent without unreasonable conditions that satisfy their need for control.\n\nGrandparents will sometimes become co-conspirators in the restrictive gate-keeping\n\nWe commonly see such parents defer to their parents (the child's grandparents) for help with the gate-keeping. The grandmother or grandfather then becomes a gate-keeping vehicle that assists the alienating parent throughout the process.\n\nWhen a restrictive parent stops the child from seeing the other parent, court action becomes urgent. A gate-keeper is not a parent who reasonably believes they should limit contact. He or she is a parent who is often intent on destroying the other parent's relationship with the child.\n\nIf the other parent does not take immediate court action, that parent empowers the restrictive parent to continue.\n\nThe inaction often results in the bond between the other parent and the child to break.\n\nThis happens because the other parent spends limited or no time with his or her child.\n\nWhen confronted with the restrictive gate-keeper, seeking joint custody is sometimes a mistake\n\nSetting forth the restrictive gate-keeper's misconduct may justify asking the court for primary or even sole custody. Until the restrictive parent shows a willingness to co-parent and become reasonable, this may be the only reasonable option.\n\nIf the court does not grant your request, you will have at least set a precedent for it. Therefore, if you revisit it later, you may remind the court this was the concern you shared earlier, and it remains a concern.\n\nAll of this assumes you are the parent with the necessary parenting skills. It also assumes you have the time to dedicate to the child's care.\n\nHow can keeping a child from the other parent backfire if there are no court orders?\n\nJust because there are no court orders does not mean a parent can frustrate the other parent's time with the child. The parent whose time was unreasonably frustrated has several options:\n\nThe parent can ask the court for primary physical custody of the child or children. Frustration of parenting time is a factor the court takes into consideration when it makes custody orders. In extreme cases, especially those that involve abduction or concealing of the child, sole custody may be an appropriate request.\n\nThe parent can ask the court to order the other parent into parenting or co-parenting classes. Some parents who keep a child from the other parent do so due to their own immaturity or failure to understand how such behavior actually hurts the child. Parenting or co-parenting classes can help.\n\nCalifornia Family Code 271 is designed to punish bad behavior by ordering a spouse or parent to pay the victimized parent's attorney fees if the unreasonable parent engaged in litigation misconduct. Keeping a child from the other parent, taking unreasonable positions during a custody case and forcing litigation and court proceedings are all sanctionable under section 271.\n\nCan a parent stop a child from seeing the other parent by claiming it is the child's choice?\n\nThis part of the article is not about a situation where a child does not want to see the other parent for legitimate reasons. Such reasons include abuse or severe neglect. Instead, we write about those situations where a parent improperly influenced the child not to see the other parent.\n\nTo understand how and why this happens, a parent must understand parental alienation. Parental alienation is a common tactic by one parent who intends to significantly harm and even destroy the other parent's relationship with the child. From our article titled \"What is Parental Alienation and What Can You Do About it?\" (linked below), here is our definition.\n\n\"Alienation, by definition, means to isolate one thing from another. In the case of parental alienation, it means steps (often planned and malicious ones) a parent takes to isolate the child or children from the other parent through words and conduct and to create a division, estrangement and even hostility between the victimized parent and child.\"\n\nThere is little a parent can do to stop the alienation absent a court order. The way to stop it is for one of the following to occur.\n\nThe alienating parent voluntarily changes his or her behavior, which rarely happens, or\n\nThe victimized parent obtains a court order that takes custody away from the alienating parent.\n\nWe encourage you to read our articles on parental alienation as it will provide you with a proper strategy on how to document the misconduct. It will also teach you how to seek appropriate court orders to put an end to it.\n\nWe are skeptical of the \"child's choice\" claim some parents make. If the parent who is not seeing the child caused significant harm to the parent-child relationship, then a judge may see the child's choice as one that has evidentiary support.\n\nHowever, absent that, there has to be another explanation and it is often parental alienation and interference with the parent-child relationship.\n\nChildren just do not, without a specific explanation, stop caring for and desiring to spend time with a parent. That effect has causes.\n\nCan a parent stop a child from seeing the other parent by refusing to follow a court order?\n\nThe short answer is no; a parent cannot lawfully stop the child from seeing the other parent in such a circumstance.\n\nCourt orders are not suggestions.\n\nThey direct parents to comply with them.\n\nA parent who refuses to comply with a child custody order and stops a child from seeing the other parent violates the court order.\n\nAs I write this article, our law firm just won a contempt action, and the judge found the mother guilty of over 20 counts of contempt for her failure to abide by a child custody order.\n\nSuch action must be the measure of resolve by a parent who does not see his or her child as a result of the other parent's violations of an order.\n\nTo read more about contempt, check out our informative guide about family law contempt actions linked later in this article.\n\nAre there situations a parent, despite a court order, should stop a child from seeing the other parent?\n\nIf there is child abuse or other conduct by the other parent that endangers the child's health or safety, a parent may take lawful steps to prevent the visitation.\n\nHowever, absent extreme circumstances, a parent usually has the option of contacting the proper authorities including the police or child protective services. Also, if there is an immediate threat of harm to the child, a parent may seek emergency child custody relief.\n\nTo learn more about emergency court orders, read our article titled, Ex Parte Divorce and Ex Parte Custody Orders Are About Real Emergencies.\n\nHow can keeping a child from the other parent backfire if there are court orders?\n\nWe discussed contempt earlier and that is the most severe remedy against a parent who violates a court order. Contempt can carry fines, community service, and even jail.\n\nBut in addition to a contempt action, keeping a child from the other parent in violation of a court order can also backfire by losing custody of the child. This can happen even if the parents share near equal or equal parenting time, such as a 50/50 custody schedule.\n\nA parent who violates a custody order does not act in the best interests of a child. Such a parent is either reckless or dangerous to a child's needs. Courts can and do take custody away from such parents depending on the severity of the misconduct.\n\nContact us for an affordable strategy session\n\nOur attorneys do not have patience with a parent who unjustifiably interferes with the parent's parent-child relationship. Some of these malicious, interfering parents know they have no grounds to seek court orders to restrict or eliminate parenting time so they engage in self help. They count on the fact the victimized parent will not act.\n\nUnfortunately, many times, the malicious parent is right. Too many fathers and mothers do not take these issues seriously enough and lose out on quality time with their children.\n\nIt takes courage to take action.\n\nThrough that courage and action, you can stop a parent's unlawful or improper interference.\n\nWhen you have the courage, what do you do? You contact us.\n\nThere is no substitute for legal advice from and representation by an experienced California family law attorney.\n\nWe believe good men and women deserve great family law representation.
