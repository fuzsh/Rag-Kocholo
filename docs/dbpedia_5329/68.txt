I am always on the lookout for new books and new films that will expand my

mind and will enhance my personal development. I found a few sites that

were quite good but I found one The

New world Library founded by Marc Allen and Shakti Gawain (you might recognise

the name as the author of "˜Creative Visualization which is great.)

Steve Pavlina had an interview

with Marc Allen on becoming a millionaire, read

the article here . Marc has had his own success At age 30 Marc Allen

and Shakti Gawain launched New World Library with no capital, and today

the company is a major independent publisher with the motto: "Publishing

books and audio and video projects that change lives." A published

author himself, Marc has written several books, including The Millionaire Course: Living the Life of Your Dreams, Visionary Business: An Entrepreneur\'s Guide to Success, A Visionary Life: Conversations on Creating the Life That You Want, and The Ten-percent Solution: For Personal and Global Financial Problems.

Twenty-five years ago, in the kitchen of a small

apartment in Oakland, California, Marc Allen and Shakti Gawain started a

publishing firm known as Whatever Publishing to put out a few books and booklets

they had written. It was a shoestring operation, started with very little

capital. Total sales in 1977 were $800.

Today New World Library owns its own spacious building in Novato, California,

has eighteen employees, and had 2002 revenues in excess of $11 million. The

company's name changed in the mid-1980s to better reflect the quality

of its developing list. One of its first books, Gawain's Creative Visualization,

became an international bestseller and has sold more than 3 million copies

in English and been translated into more than thirty foreign editions.
