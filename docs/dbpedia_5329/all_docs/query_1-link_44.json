Composer, sculptor, painter, poet, prophet, sage, these are the makers of the afterworld, the architects of heaven. The world is beautiful because they have lived; without them, laboring humanity would perish. Those who cherish a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in their hearts, will one day realize\n\ncannot\n\nit.\n\nColumbus cherished\n\nworld, and he discovered\n\na vision of another it;\n\nCopernicus fos-\n\ntered the vision of a multiplicity of worlds and\n\n53\n\nCHAPTER\n\na\n\nSIX\n\nwider universe, and he revealed\n\nit;\n\nBuddha\n\nbeheld the vision of a spiritual world of stain-\n\nbeauty and perfect peace, and he entered\n\nless\n\ninto\n\nit.\n\nCherish your visions; cherish your cherish the music\n\nbeauty that forms that drapes your\n\nin\n\nthem\n\nwill\n\ngrow\n\nideals;\n\nyour heart, the your mind, the loveliness\n\nthat stirs in\n\nfinest thoughts, for out of\n\nall\n\ndelightful conditions,\n\nheavenly environment; of these, main true to them, your world will\n\nif\n\nall\n\nyou\n\nre-\n\nat last\n\nbe\n\nbuilt.\n\nTo desire\n\nis\n\nto\n\nobtain;\n\nto\n\naspire\n\nis\n\nto\n\nachieve. Shall our basest desires receive the\n\nand our purest aspirations starve for lack of sustenance? Such is not the law of the universe; such a condition of things can never obtain. \"Ask and you will fullest\n\nmeasure\n\nof gratification,\n\nreceive.''\n\nDream\n\nlofty dreams, and as you dream, so you become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil. The greatest achievement was at first and shall\n\n54\n\nVISIONS\n\nfor a time a dream.\n\nAND IDEALS\n\nThe oak\n\nsleeps in the\n\nacorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the\n\nhighest vision of the soul a w^aking angel\n\nDreams\n\nstirs.\n\nare the seedlings of realities.\n\nYour circumstances may be uncongenial, but they shall not long remain so if you but perceive an ideal and strive to reach it. You cannot travel within and stand still without. Here is a young woman, and here is a young man, both hard pressed by poverty and labor; confined long hours in an unhealthy workshop; uneducated, and lacking all the arts of refinement. But they both dream of better things; they think of intelligence, of refine-\n\nment, of grace and beauty. They conceive of, mentally build up, an ideal condition of life; the vision of a wider liberty and a larger scope takes possession of them; unrest urges them to action, and they utilize all their spare time\n\nand means, small though they are, to the development of their latent powers and resources. Very soon their minds have become so altered that the workshop can no longer hold them.\n\nIt\n\nhas become so out of\n\n55\n\nharmony\n\nCHAPTER\n\nSIX\n\nwith their mentaUty that lives as a\n\ngarment\n\nis\n\nit falls\n\nout of their\n\ncast aside, and,\n\nwith the\n\ngrowth of opportunities which fit the scope of their expanding powers, both of them pass out of\n\nit\n\nforever.\n\nYears later\n\nwe\n\nsee\n\nthem\n\nas\n\nfull-grown\n\nadults. We find them, each in their own unique way, masters of certain forces of the mind which they wield with worldwide influence and almost unequalled power. In their hands they hold the cords of gigantic responsibihties; they speak, and lives are changed; men and women hang upon their words and remold their characters, and, sunhke, they become the fixed and luminous center around which innumerable destinies revolve. They have realized the vision of their youth. They have become one with their ideals.\n\nAnd you the vision\n\nbe\n\nit\n\ntoo, youthful reader, will realize\n\n— not the\n\nidle\n\nwish\n\n—\n\nof\n\nyour heart,\n\nbase or beautiful, or a mixture of both,\n\nfor you will always gravitate toward that which you, secretly, most love. Into your hands will be placed the exact results of your own\n\n56\n\n— VISIONS\n\nAND IDEALS\n\nthoughts; you will receive that which you\n\nno more, no less. Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain, or rise with your thoughts, your vision, your ideal. You will become as small as your controlling desire; you will become as great as your dominant aspi-\n\nearn,\n\nration.\n\nIn the beautiful\n\nwords\n\nof Stanton\n\nKirkham\n\nDavis,\n\n\"You may be keeping accounts, and presently you shall walk out of the door that for so long has seemed to you the barrier of your ideals, and shall find yourself before an audience— the pen still behind your ear, the inkstains on your fingers and then and there shall pour out the torrent of your inspiration.\n\n\"You may be driving sheep, and you shall wander to the city— bucolic and open-mouthed; and you wander under the intrepid guidance of the spirit into the studio of the master, and after a time he shall say, 'I have nothing more to teach\n\n51\n\nCHAPTER\n\nSIX\n\nyou/ And now you have becon^e the master, who did so recently dream of great things while driving sheep.
