        "text": "Description\n\nThis 10-week course will use the multidisciplinary field of book history to explore how medieval and early modern people used different media-theological texts, maps, letters, travel narratives, reference works, literature, and more- to make sense of a changing world. Through lectures, discussions, and interactive workshops with faculty from CRS consortium institutions, participants will learn how book history can illuminate the ways in which premodern people used religion, science, art, and technology to grapple with new economic, intellectual, and cultural challenges in a rapidly-expanding global community."
