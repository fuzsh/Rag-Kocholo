Please call or email the department with requests for this material prior to planning your visit. Oversized items and some photographic materials remain onsite in Special Collections and Archives.\n\nHistorical Outline: World Publishing Company\n\n1898: Alfred Cahen arrived in London after walking across Europe from Poland, learning the printing business in Poland, Russia, Germany, and Holland. In London he worked for a company that did phamplets, library bindings, and repaired manuscripts for museums and private collectors.\n\n1902: Mr. Cahen left London and came to Ohio where he worked for the Saalfield Publishing Company in Akron.\n\n1905: Mr. Cahen opened his own bindery in Cleveland, the beginning of the Commercial Bookbinding Company.\n\n1912: Cylinder presses were added, giving the company printing as well as binding facilities.\n\n1916: The company built its own plant at West 110th street and Western Avenue.\n\n1920: Fire destroyed the whole plant.\n\n1921: The plant was again in production.\n\n1923: A second building was erected.\n\n1928: A third building was added. Automatic machinery, unique in the industry, was designed and built by Mr. Cahen and later adopted by most large book manufacturers as well as the Government Printing establishment. Mr. Cahen's two sons, Herman and Julius, both engineers and graduates of Case Institute of Technology, helped build the various machines. The World Syndicate Publishing Company was acquired along with their office in New York City. The company began publishing Bibles, dictionaries, and children's books.\n\n1929: The company went public with a stock issue. LINDBERG, THE LONE EAGLE, was written, printed and bound in only one week, becoming the first book on that historic flight and launching World into trade publishing.\n\n1930: The company set up an office in Chicago.\n\n1933: Lillian, daughter of Alfred Cahen, marries Ben D. Zevin. Lillian had worked in the company starting as a teenager in the mid-1920s. She eventually became editor-in-chief and helped to lead the company during its most successful years.\n\n1935: Ben D. Zevin joins the company.\n\n1936: Another building was put up to house the growing plant.\n\n1939: The Tower Books series, each title sold at $.49, was launched.\n\n1940: The company had become the largest publisher of Bibles and dictionaries in the United States.\n\n1941: Work was started on Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language.\n\n1942: Forum Books, a $1.00 reprint line, was started, and the children's book line was growing much larger. During World War II, 17 million government-issued Bibles were distributed to the armed forces, and four out of every ten were made by World.\n\n1945: Ben Zevin became president of the company.\n\n1949: The Bruce Rogers World Bible was published in an edition limited to 975 copies.\n\n1953: The College Edition of the New World Dictionary was published and quickly became the leading college dictionary in the country.\n\n1963: The company was sold to Times Mirror, who eventually sold it to William Collins Sons, Ltd. When that company was disbanded in 1980, the dictionary division was sold to Simon & Schuster, who still publish Webster's New World Dictionary. The Bibles, children's and trade books were sold to various other companies, and some of these are still in print.\n\nScope and Content: The records of the World Publishing Company include correspondence, financial records, photographs, slides, and various publications. Lillian Zevin's father was Alfred H. Cahen, the founder of the World Publishing Company as well as the Commercial Bookbinding Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The collection includes records from the time period of Commercial as well as World. But because this collection of records was a personal collection from an individual and not the company's official archive, there are some gaps in the record. However, this collection is still rich in documenting the history of the company and particularly significant are the financial records which are complete, as well as files on the high spots of World's publishing focus: Bibles and dictionaries.\n\nArrangement: The collection is organized into the following series and sub-series.\n\nSeries 1: Publications: Annual Reports\n\nSeries 2: Publications: Books\n\nSeries 3: Publications: Catalogs\n\nSeries 4: Publications: Dummy (Proof) Copies\n\nSeries 5: Publications: Bible Slipcases\n\nSeries 6: Publications: Our World\n\nSeries 7: Slides\n\nSeries 8: Record Books\n\nSeries 9: Oversized files\n\nSeries 10: Correspondence\n\nSeries 11: Commemorations\n\nSeries 12: Miscellaneous Historical Records\n\nSeries 13: Photographs\n\nSub-series 1: World Publishing Company Facilities and Plant Operations\n\nSub-series 2: World Publishing Company Events and Personnel\n\nSub-series 3: Photographs of World Authors\n\nSeries 14: License agreements, Book jacket requests\n\nSeries 15: Subject files\n\nSeries 16: Artwork\n\nSeries 17: Negative Microfilm\n\nRelated Materials: Books printed by World Publishing have been cataloged in KentLINK and can be found by performing a SUBJECT search on \"World Publishing Company Collection.\"\n\nAcquisition Information: Most of the materials are from the personal collection of the late Lillian Zevin, the ex-wife of Ben Zevin, former President of the World Publishing Company. They were given to the Department of Special Collections and Archives in 1986 along with a substantial collection of books printed by World Publishing.\n\nRestrictions on Use: Kent State University does not own copyright to World Publishing Company publications.
