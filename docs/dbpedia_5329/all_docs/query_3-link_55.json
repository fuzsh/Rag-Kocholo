One of the era's grandest innovations was the building of Australia’s first public library.\n\nThe Melbourne Public Library (as it was then known) was envisaged as a pantheon of the world’s knowledge, open to any citizen over the age of 14 – provided they had clean hands – and offering free access to self-education unmatched by any other public institution in the nation.\n\nThis colourful tale of a century of institutional and architectural reform provides a fascinating insight into the development of Melbourne as Australia’s cultural capital.\n\nHarriet Edquist is Professor of Architectural History and Director of the RMIT Design Archives at RMIT University, Melbourne."
