The following paragraphs define imagination as the \"creative energy of the universe\", and introduces the book as a means by which to use the so-defined imagination to \"create what you truly want — love, fulfillment, enjoyment, satisfying relationships, rewarding work, self-expression, health, beauty, prosperity, inner peace, and harmony.\"[6]\n\nThe book has been a bestseller for nearly 40 years.[7] Subsequent to the popularity of the book, the practice of creative visualization, remained a staple and stable feature within the New Age movement, self-help media, and popular psychology of the 1980s, 1990s, and first decade of the 21st century.[8]\n\nNew World Library\n\n[edit]\n\nGawain was the co-founder, with Marc Allen, of New World Library Publishing Company, and founder of Nataraj Publishing, a division of New World Library.[1]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nCreative Visualization: Use the Power of Your Imagination to Create What You Want in Your Life (1978)\n\nLiving in the Light: A Guide to Personal and Planetary Transformation (1985)\n\nDeveloping Intuition: Practical Guidance for Daily Life (1987)\n\nContacting Your Inner Guide: Step-By-Step Guided Meditations Designed to Help You Make Choices That Are Right for You (1989)\n\nReturn to the Garden (1989)\n\nAwakening: A Daily Guide to Conscious Living (1991)\n\nEvery Moment: A Journal with Affirmations (1992)\n\nMeditations: Creative Visualization and Meditation Exercises to Enrich Your Life (1992)\n\nThe Path of Transformation: How Healing Ourselves Can Change the World (1993)\n\nThe Four Levels of Healing: A Guide to Balancing the Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, and Physical Aspects of Life (1996)\n\nCreative Visualization Meditations (1996)\n\nCreating True Prosperity (1997)\n\nCreative Visualization and Transformation (1997)\n\nPartnering: A New Kind of Relationship (2000)\n\nReflections in the Light: Daily Thoughts and Affirmations (2003)\n\nCreate Your Own Affirmations: A Creative Visualization Kit (2003)\n\nThe Millionaire Course: A Visionary Plan for Creating the Life of Your Dreams (2003)\n\nLiving in the Light: Follow Your Inner Guidance to Create a New Life and a New World (2011)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
