        "text": "Bestselling author Shakti Gawain, a co-founder of New World Library in Novato and a pioneer in the Marin self-help movement of the 1970s, died Nov. 11 after complications from hip surgery. She was 70.\n\nMs. Gawain, whose 1978 landmark book “Creative Visualization” was the launching pad in consciousness and metaphysical studies for a whole generation, had suffered with Parkinson’s disease and later Lewy body dementia. Her condition, which gradually deteriorated over the years, worsened after a fall at her Mill Valley home on Sept. 30. She died at Marin General Hospital.\n\n“She walked her talk until the very end,” said New World Library publicist Kim Corbin, who first interviewed Ms. Gawain in 2012 and who worked closely with her for the next five years. “While the depth of my grief at her passing knows no bounds, I take heart in the fact that she’s free from all of that now.”\n\nCorbin noted that numerous friends and fans have posted tributes and condolences on Ms. Gawain’s Facebook page.\n\n“Shakti was a healer whose initial book, ‘Creative Visualization,’ changed my life,” Marin-based therapist and author Susan Pease Gadoua said in an email. “I learned that whatever I could imagine, I could manifest. My world immediately got bigger as a result.”\n\nMs. Gawain rose to fame after she appeared as a guest in one of the first episodes of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” after it was nationally syndicated in 1986. From there, Ms. Gawain went on to teach workshops on consciousness, and to write and publish 12 books that have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide in 38 languages.\n\n“She was always full of energy,” said New World Library co-founder Marc Allen, who met Carol Louise Gawain in Berkeley in 1974 and coined her nickname “Shakti,” the Sanskrit name for the divine feminine creative force.\n\n“Shakti was the perfect name for her. She was driven to keep sharing everything she was learning with all her friends,” Allen said in a post on his own Facebook page. “It led to her leading some small workshops and then writing ‘Creative Visualization.'”\n\nMs. Gawain and Allen initially started Whatever Publishing in a small Oakland apartment. After the worldwide popularity of “Creative Visualization,” they changed the business name to New World Library and moved it to Novato.\n\n“‘Creative Visualization’ has penetrated deeply into the mass consciousness of not only this country, but a great many other countries around the world,” Allen added. “It should be taught in every high school in the world. Her books will live on. Her legacy will live on.”\n\nMs. Gawain went on to write such titles as “Living in the Light,”\n\n“Return to the Garden,” “The Path of Transformation,” “The Four Levels of Healing,” “Creating True Prosperity” and “Developing Intuition.”\n\nShe left New World Library in 1992, establishing a new publishing company, Nataraj Publishing, with her husband Jim Burns, and founding a healing center, Shakti Center, in Marin City. After Shakti Center was closed, Nataraj became an imprint of New World Library.\n\n“The 2012 conversation with Shakti Gawain was one of the first author interviews I ever did,” Corbin said in an email. “It also ended up being her last video interview, due to the Lewy body dementia that eventually caused her to lose her train of thought very easily.”\n\n“Lewy body is the same disease that Robin Williams suffered from before he took his own life,” Corbin added. “The way Shakti implemented the wealth of tools in her spiritual toolbox to stay positive and in love with life, despite her diagnosis, was a true inspiration.”\n\nGadoua, who got to know Ms. Gawain personally, said her work “changed the direction of my life in big ways. Professionally, I went on to study Voice Dialogue and I use it often in my work. Personally, I credit my work with her for preparing me to meet my husband.\n\n“She was a natural healer who truly lived in the light,” Gadoua said. “I know she has helped thousands of other people as well and she will be missed by many.”\n\nMs. Gawain was born in Trenton, N.J., on Sept. 30, 1948, to the Theodore Gawain and Elizabeth Miller Gawain.\n\nShe attended Reed College in Portland, Ore., for several years before transferring to the University of California, Irvine, where she earned a bachelor of arts degree in dance in June 1971.\n\nHer first, and only, 9-to-5 job after graduation was as a receptionist at the South Vietnam Embassy in Washington, D.C., shortly before the end of the Vietnam War. After that, she spent two years living in Europe and traveling in a van to places like Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.\n\nWhen Ms. Gawain returned to the U.S., she settled in the Bay Area and began pursuing her passion for consciousness and metaphysical studies in earnest. That was when Allen and Ms. Gawain’s path first crossed in 1974. In 1988, Ms. Gawain met and fell in love with Burns, her husband of 28 years, on a beach in Big Sur. They were married in August 1990 at her then-home on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.\n\nBurns, who lives in Mill Valley, was at Ms. Gawain’s side when she died.\n\nServices will be planned at a later date. Memorial contributions can be made in Ms. Gawain’s name to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.\n\n“We are grateful that her legacy will live on through her books, audios and videos,” Corbin said. “And in the lives of so many people she not only touched emotionally, but genuinely helped to have better, more fulfilling lives.”"
