Much more than yet another book about a great saint who once was, it actually rekindles something of St. Teresa’s outrageous spiritual impulse for contemporary readers, particularly those who describe themselves as “spiritual, not religious.” Tessa Bielecki shows how Teresa’s vibrant natural life was the foundation of her mystical one, then sympathetically explores the captivating sensuousness of her mystical growth. She presents Teresa’s “bridal mysticism” — a powerful approach to experiencing God as spouse — in a way that inspires both men and women, and concludes with practical advice on how the contemplative life ripens into “the ultimate ecstasy” through service in the world. This new edition of Holy Daring — revised and updated — will be an abiding source of inspiration to all who want a fuller, deeper, more meaningful and balanced life. Tessa Bielecki is the author of several books on St. Teresa of Avila, as well as a former Abbess. “Tessa’s deep intimacy with Teresa of Avila…creates an invitational space for readers of any tradition (or none) to enter into their own transformational relationship with the ‘wild woman of Avila.'”–Mirabai Starr.\n\nThe Illustrated Walden: Thoreau Bicentennial Edition, by Henry David Thoreau (TarcherPerigee), 400 pages — To coincide with the bicentennial of Thoreau’s birth and TarcherPerigee’s publication of Expect Great Things: The Life of Henry David Thoreau, here is a sumptuous rediscovery edition of the first illustrated volume of Thoreau’s classic, as originally issued in 1897. In 1897, thirty-five years after Thoreau’s death, Houghton Mifflin issued a two-volume “Holiday Edition” of Walden illustrated with thirty remarkable engravings, daguerreotypes, and period photographs. In 1902 the publisher collected the work into a single volume. Now, to mark the bicentennial of Thoreau’s birth in 1817, this timeless landmark is reproduced with all of the original illustrations and the complete text of his mystical, practical, magisterial record of a life in the woods.\n\nThe Power of Kindness: The Unexpected Benefits of Leading a Compassionate Life (10th Anniversary Edition), by Piero Ferrucci (TarcherPerigee), 352 pages — “A book after my own heart!”– His Holiness The Dalai Lama. The Power of Kindness is a stirring examination of a simple but profound concept. Piero Ferrucci, one of the world’s most respected transpersonal psychologists, explores the many surprising facets of kindness and argues that it is this trait that will not only lead to our own individual happiness and the happiness of those around us, but will guide us in a world that has become cold, anxious, difficult and frightening. Piero Ferrucci warns against the dangers of “global cooling.” As the pace of living grows faster and the impact of new technologies more insistent, communications become hurried and impersonal. The drive for profit overrides the heart. Warmth and genuine presence fade. In eighteen interlocking chapters, Dr. Ferrucci reveals that the kindest people are the most likely to thrive, to enable others to thrive, and to slowly but steadily turn our world away from violence, self-centeredness, and narcissism- and toward love. Writing with a rare combination of sensitivity and intellectual depth, Dr. Ferrucci shows that, ultimately, kindness is not a luxury in our world but rather a necessity for us all.\n\nPsycho-Cybernetics Deluxe Edition: The Original Text of the Classic Guide to a New Life, by Maxwell Maltz (Penguin Publishing Group), 336 pages — A magnificent, deluxe edition of one of the greatest and top-selling self-help books ever written, suited to a lifetime of reading, rereading, note taking, and display.

Blavatsky (TarcherPerigree), 1,296 pages — Complete and unabridged, here is the unparalleled landmark of occult philosophy and lost history that reshaped the modern spiritual mindset and continues to fascinate readers today. There is perhaps no greater enigma in modern Western literature than The Secret Doctrine. The controversial Russian noblewoman Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky told the world that the book restored humanity’s lost history and destiny. Its insights, she said, had been gleaned from long-secret books of wisdom and her tutelage under mahatmas, or great souls: adepts from the East who exposed the seeker to their esoteric teaching. To read The Secret Doctrine is to enter a mysterious world of ancient cosmology and spiritual-scientific insights, which tell of humanity’s unthinkably ancient past and its burgeoning evolution into a new, more refined existence. For the first time, Blavatsky’s encyclopedia arcana is available in a reset and redesigned single-volume edition, complete and unabridged. Its truths and challenges are available to the intrepid reader, who may find yet-unknown insights within its pages.\n\nNew Books\n\nThe Anne Dialogues: Communications with the Ascended, by Guy Needler (Ozark Mountain Publishing), 320 pages — The Anne Dialogues provides a behind-the-energetic-scenes look at what happens in the incarnation process. Readers are taken each step of the way from the point of death to the decision to incarnate again and through the myriad teachings in between. A channeled work, this book is an insider’s view of the actual process of dying and ascending to the spirit side. Imagine what it would be like to talk to a recently deceased loved one. What questions would you ask? What is it like? Are previous reports correct? In The Anne Dialogues, these questions were asked and a depth of knowledge never before experienced was returned. Guy Needler has always been aware of the greater reality being around him, catching glimpses of the worlds of spirit. He was told by his guides to focus on his earthly contribution when in his late thirties he was re-awakened to his spiritual roles. Along with his healing abilities, his spiritual associations include being able to channel information from spirit, including constant contact with other entities within our multi-verse and his higher self and guides.\n\nAyurveda Lifestyle Wisdom: A Complete Prescription to Optimize Your Health, Prevent Disease, and Live with Vitality and Joy, by Acharya Shunya (Sounds True), 384 pages — Ayurveda teaches us that true health is our birthright–and that by artfully adapting to the rhythms of nature, we can bring ourselves back into balance and experience optimal well-being. Ayurveda Lifestyle Wisdom is a groundbreaking work within the field of holistic health and traditional yoga, written by internationally renowned Ayurvedic healer, teacher, and scholar Acharya Shunya.

Here, she presents both an engaging narrative of her unique education, as well as a complete encyclopedia of Ayurvedic practices, recipes, and knowledge. With Ayurveda Lifestyle Wisdom, Shunya maintains the integrity of Ayurveda’s traditional teachings while showing us how to integrate them into our modern lifestyles. Through her in-depth teachings, we learn to live in a way that supports our greatest health through daily ritual, nourishing food, spiritual practice, and self-care. “This book…has the potential to change your state of health for the better, permanently,” writes Shunya. “Health is not a probability that you may achieve. It is a reality, an underlying natural state of being.” Whether you’re looking for help with a specific health concern, or if you’d simply like to improve your overall well-being, in Ayurveda Lifestyle Wisdom you’ll finda treasury of Ayurvedic lifestyle teachings and wellness practices for every part of your day.\n\nBelonging to God: Science, Spirituality & a Universal Path of Divine Love, by William Keepin (Turner Publishing), 300 pages — A breathtaking exploration of divine love in Christianity, Islam and Hinduism — and the writings of leading mystics from these traditions — culminating in a glorious universal path of love that is illuminated equally by modern science and ancient wisdom. There is a unified call from all religions for the human soul to follow a profound path of love that leads to union with God. Belonging to God examines the commonalities in the scriptures, writings of key mystics and core practices of Christianity, Islam and Hinduism in order to illuminate a clear universal path of divine love. It weaves the common spiritual threads into an elegant theological framework, drawing on recent scientific advances in fractal geometry and quantum physics to emphasize the transforming fire that burns on every level from macrocosm to the microcosm, thereby uniting the human soul with the heart of God. Combining decades of Eastern and Western contemplative practice with scientific research, Belonging to God concludes with twelve principles of divine love that point toward a universal spiritual path of the heart, both within and beyond the religions. Easy to comprehend and uplifting to read, this interfaith journey will appeal to seekers of all faiths interested in the path of love that bridges the world religions, as well as to believers within the Christian, Hindu and Islamic traditions who are eager to learn exactly how their particular faith intersects in a deep way with other religions. Belonging to God will also inspire students of perennial wisdom, comparative mysticism and the new science, and the large number of “spiritual but not religious” seekers who yearn for a universal path of divine love that honors — yet transcends — traditional religions.\n\nEncounters with Power: Adventures and Misadventures on the Shamanic Path of Healing, by José Luis Stevens (Sounds True), 272 pages — When you leave the beaten path of civilization, you enter the world of primal and mysterious forces–and encounter wonders you never thought possible. This is the territory of the shaman. To learn the secrets of shamanism, José Luis Stevens has traveled to the remote and wild places where the oldest human spiritual practice still exists in its purest form. With Encounters with Power, this respected teacher invites you to experience his journeys to meet shamans around the globe–and share in the wisdom he received. Join this master storyteller as he recounts his meetings with Spirit in its many guises, including: India and the Life-Changing Reading — at a turning point in his life, Jose receives a startlingly accurate prophecy; Lost in Mexico — a humbling education in the difference between “power” and “control”; and The Guatemala Test and Initiation — the power of being frugal with judgment and generous with forgiveness. Power is everywhere — encounters with power can happen any time. “In my travels to meet these extraordinary healers,” writes José, “I’ve had terrifying, enlightening, and at times hugely entertaining adventures. Power can destroy us or it can raise us up by teaching us and nourishing us. I may not be a master, but I have learned a few things that you may find helpful on your own quest.”\n\nEnlightenment Now: Liberation Is Your True Nature, by Jason Gregory (Inner Traditions/Bear & Company), 176 pages — In this philosophical, psychological, and spiritual exploration of enlightenment, Jason Gregory addresses how to access the original spontaneous awareness we all came into this world with. He exposes the illusion that we must strive to reach enlightenment, uncovering how our yearning for future accomplishments, attachment to the past, and reliance on authority outside the self are social constructs that distract us from the reality of the now. The author explains how our original enlightened nature has been obscured by social, cultural, religious, and egotistical conditioning of the mind caught in time. Building on knowledge from spiritual traditions including Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism, Gregory expresses the timeless and ever-present nature of enlightenment. He illustrates how rigid practices and initiations can become a form of spiritual postponement, continually putting off our enlightenment because we feel we are doing something good and noble. To chase enlightenment through spiritual practice is to assume it is a quality bound to time. The author helps us see that we are already what we are seeking–once we understand that existing in this world is itself a miracle beyond words, then the magic and beauty of our world will unfold. In the same way we remember someone’s name without thinking about it, we also remember that we are enlightened when we stop searching for the experience. Emerging from the Middle Way of the Buddha, Lao-tzu’s Way of the Tao, Yoga, the Great Work of Gnosticism, the Hermetic Art of Alchemy, and quantum physics, Gregory presents a way to the state of consciousness — enlightenment, nirvana, or samadhi — in which eternity and time are one. He shows us how to counteract the negative impact of social and cultural conditioning on our psyche through meditation and reframing our understanding of time. The author explains how meditation in its truest form takes our awareness of nowness from theory to practice. Guiding us away from a time-bound understanding of enlightenment, Gregory shows us how to find ourselves in the stillness of now where the peace you are is the peace you give to the world.\n\nFully Engaged: Using the Practicing Mind in Daily Life, by Thomas M. Sterner (New World Library), 120 pages — To be fully engaged in life means that we have clear goals as well as the focus and skills to accomplish those goals with ease and a sense of calm awareness. In his first book, The Practicing Mind, which remains a bestseller in its category, Thomas Sterner set out clear guidelines for developing focus and discipline to achieve any life goal. As Tom traveled and spoke about the book, he kept track of the questions readers and participants at his seminars asked. The answers to those questions — or more accurately, the exploration of those questions — became the basis of Fully Engaged. This new book explores specific techniques, such as thought awareness training and setting goals with accurate data, and demonstrates how using these techniques will not only help you reach your objectives, but will keep you engaged in each moment of your life, throughout the process of accomplishing those goals. Being thus engaged will result in less stress and more satisfaction in every aspect of life. Thomas M. Sterner is the founder and CEO of the Practicing Mind Institute. As a successful entrepreneur, he is considered an expert in Present Moment Functioning, or PMF™. He is a popular and in-demand speaker and coach who works with high-performance industry groups and individuals, including athletes, helping them to operate effectively in high-stress situations so that they can break through to new levels of mastery.\n\nGuided: Reclaiming the Intuitive Voice of Your Soul, by Hans Christian King (Atria/Enliven Books), 240 pages — Access your intuition and explore your true divine, timeless nature with the science-based teachings of Hans King, “one of the top five psychics in the country” (Miami Herald).

Each chapter offers constructive insights into what creates, drives, and disarms the critic; real people’s journeys to inspire and guide readers; and simple practices anyone can use to live a free, happy, and flourishing life.

These changes correspond with the activation of new Waves of Creation emanating from the center of the universe that influence human thinking. From the Big Bang to the present, these Waves guide the evolution of the universe and, through their holographic resonance with the human mind, profoundly shape revolutions in religion, technology, economy, and social consciousness. Presenting a quantum-holographic perspective on world history and human consciousness, Carl Calleman explains the quantum physics behind the Waves of the Mayan Calendar system and how these Waves allow us to understand the shifting eras on Earth as well as the possibilities of the future. He describes how, prior to the activation of the 6th Wave in 3115 BCE, our social systems were based on a unified cosmic order, but the hologram of this Wave shifted society to an all-consuming focus on Good and Evil, leading to the rise of patriarchal religious structures, slavery, and warfare. He explores how later Waves and their new holograms helped humanity survive the negative effects of the 6th Wave, such as the Industrial Revolution of the 7th Wave and the Digital Revolution of the 8th Wave. In 2011, the 9th Wave was activated, bringing with it an accelerated push for a more egalitarian world, a rising awareness of unity consciousness, and access to the full power of all Nine Waves of Creation. Calleman explains how our individual resonance with each Wave plays a role in the quality of our lives and how we must consciously work to resonate with the higher Waves. Revealing how we can become quantum activists in a holographic world by aligning with the 9th Wave, the author shows how we each can help manifest the destiny of humanity hinted at in ancient texts.\n\nThe (not so) Little Book of Surprises, by Deirdre Hade and William Arntz (Waterside Productions), 136 pages — The (not so) Little Book of Surprises is a verbal and graphic trip to the unexpected, whimsical, and wise worlds of writer and poet Deirdre Hade and her husband and graphic visionary Will Arntz.

Deirdre Hade is a Modern Day Mystic. A spiritual adept since childhood she has spent her life communicating with the unseen. At sixteen her mother was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer, it was at this time that Deirdre discovered the healing powers of light enabling her mother to live thirteen years longer than expected. Her work is taught by Jack Canfield, America’s Success Coach. William Arntz began his professional career as a research laser physicist, developing wave optics simulators for high energy lasing systems. After a few years of traveling he landed in San Francisco and began studying with his first spiritual teacher, Rama (a.k.a. Dr. Fredrick Lenz). Eventually the students were given the task of writing a software product/company whereupon William wrote “AutoSys” – a distributed event processor. He sold the company 2 years later and retired. Soon thereafter William began attending the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. While there he became interested in getting some of the principles gleaned from his decades of spiritual inquiry out to the general public. He realized he could satisfy a life long dream and use the software proceeds to make a movie. That movie started life as a small documentary about Spirit and Science, but grew in scope (and budget) and became What the #$*! Do We Know?! Producing, scripting, and directing the film, What the Bleep was completed in 2004 and went on to become a global phenomena, with well over 100 million viewers experiencing the Bleep.\n\nOrdinary Goodness: The Surprisingly Effortless Path to Creating a Life of Meaning and Beauty, by Edward Viljoen (Penguin Publishing Group), 240 pages — A call to action to live a life full of goodness and purpose. People often struggle to find a life filled with passion, happiness — and just plain goodness. This struggle drives many to depression and addictive tendencies. Author and New Thought minister Edward Viljoen argues that the struggle need not be an arduous or painful one — that through everyday acts of kindness, faith, and compassion we can create peaceful and contented lives. Using personal stories, practical tips, and exercises, this book shows us that regardless of our circumstances, we can create meaning and beauty in our lives and in the world. Viljoen offers deep insights, showing: how caring about ordinary things leads to meaningful and extraordinary life experiences; how society’s messages about perfection distract us from our ordinary goodness; and how faith is a muscle that must be exercised. People are always striving to live happy and fulfilled lives. This book reassures us that this is attainable — nothing extraordinary is required.\n\nThe Past Life Perspective: Discovering Your True Nature Across Multiple Lifetimes, by Ann C.

Our reliance on technology is rapidly changing how each of us experiences life. We’re facing new issues and difficulties, we’re encountering new emotional triggers, and we’re relating to each other in new ways. As Dr. Nancy Colier writes, “How we spend our time, what motivates us, and what we want are all are on a radical course of transformation.” The promise of technology is that it will make our lives easier; yet to realize that promise, we cannot be passive users–we must bring awareness and mindfulness to our relationships with our devices. “The compulsion to constantly check our devices plays on primal instincts,” teaches Colier. “Even people with strong spiritual practices or those who have never had other addiction issues now find themselves caught in the subtle trap of these miraculous tools we’ve created.” Through The Power of Off, she offers us a path for making use of the virtual world while still feeling good, having healthy relationships, and staying connected with what is genuinely meaningful in life. With The Power of Off, Colier sounds the call for wakefulness, reminding us that we can use technology in a way that promotes, rather than detracts from, our well-being. This book provides an essential resource for anyone wanting to create a more empowered relationship with technology in the digital age.\n\nThe Re-Enchantment: A Shamanic Path to a Life of Wonder, by Hank Wesselman (Sounds True), 216 pages — This is an invitation to awaken to a reality of wonder and infinite possibility. In a time when our scientific understanding of the universe has never been greater, why do so many people feel unhappy and alienated? As Dr. Hank Wesselman explains, our search for objective knowledge has come at the cost of a deeper, intuitive rapport with nature and our spiritual selves. The result is a profound disenchantment, one that affects us individually and collectively. What we need now is a “re-enchantment” — a way to renew our relationship with nature, reawaken to spiritual reality, and reclaim the sense of connection and hope that gives meaning to our lives. The Re-Enchantment offers a compelling blueprint for the emerging transformational spirituality — not a return to the superstition and ignorance of old beliefs, but a “modern upgrade of the path of the shaman” that reconnects us to our inner sources of intuition, power and healing. “There is new spiritual complex coming into being in our world,” writes Dr. Wesselman. “This mystical mosaic draws from many traditions and many cultures, and has the potential to refresh and perhaps replace our current mainstream religions with new perceptions and new insights.” With The Re-Enchantment, this leading teacher presents a provocative call to action — to engage the world with a newborn’s eyes, a shaman’s heart, and soul dedicated to a wiser, more compassionate future.\n\nThe Seven Archetypal Stones: Their Spiritual Powers and Teachings, by Nicholas Pearson (Inner Traditions/Bear & Company), 312 pages — Stones and crystals are our most ancient teachers. The relationships between the mineral kingdom and the human kingdom are as old as life itself, for the mineral kingdom — comprised of beautiful crystals, dense rocks, sands, clays, and everything in-between — is the very foundation upon which life developed on Earth. Supporting humanity through the eons, these teachers offer curative and restorative properties for healing as well as powerful guidance to catalyze spiritual growth. Integrating gemstone lore from around the world with modern mineral science, Nicholas Pearson guides readers on a journey into the inner realm of the mystery teachings of the mineral kingdom, a journey that mirrors the soul’s path to perfection. He reveals the archetypal wisdom embodied within 7 essential crystal and gemstone mentors — obsidian, jade, lapis lazuli, emerald, quartz, amethyst, and diamond — examining each stone’s mythological, historical, and cultural associations in tandem with their crystalline structure and chemical composition. He explores each stone’s healing and spiritual properties, providing practical exercises, esoteric revelations, and meditations on the specific spiritual work each stone archetype supports. Obsidian, for example, is the stone of initiation, revealing our shadow side and guiding us to places in need of light. Diamond, the final perfected stone of the seven, illuminates Divine Love, purifying us and leading our consciousness to enlightenment, cutting through any vestiges of fear or illusion because it is the hardest, sharpest, most luminous teacher the mineral kingdom has to offer. Enabling each of us to harness the power of stones for spiritual evolution and healing, this guide to the mystery teachings of the mineral kingdom shows how the ancient call to evolve with the crystals and stones that surround us lives on in an unbroken legacy.\n\nThe Shamanic Powers of Rolling Thunder: As Experienced by Alberto Villoldo, John Perry Barlow, Larry Dossey, and Others, by Sidian Morning Star Jones & Stanley Krippner (Inner Traditions/Bear & Company), 232 pages — One of the most celebrated and controversial Native American medicine men of the 20th century, Rolling Thunder (1916-1997) was known for his remarkable healings and for his ability to call on the forces of Nature, typically in the form of thunder clouds.

Revealing his trickster teachings, his legendary shamanic powers, his devotion to the Earth, and how his impact did not stop with his death, these stories of Rolling Thunder from a variety of sources demonstrate how transformation can come even while walking gently on the Earth.\n\nStart Right Where You Are: How Little Changes Can Make a Big Difference for Overwhelmed Procrastinators, Frustrated Overachievers, and Recovering Perfectionists, by Sam Bennett (New World Library), 256 pages — What Are You Waiting For?

The Szen Zone: Reaching a State of Positive Change contains lighthearted and positive narrative on life and its possibilities, with stories that cover the gamut from interesting to profound.

Through our own engagement and self-exploration, Mooji helps us to arrive at the answers, not from the limited perspective in which we’ve been conditioned, but from our own deepest Knowing — revealing the timeless, boundless love and freedom that is the natural perfume of the Absolute.\n\nVoices in the Stones: Life Lessons from the Native Way, by Kent Nerburn (New World Library), 184 pages — The genius of the Native Americans has always been their profound spirituality and their deep understanding of the land and its ways. For three decades, author Kent Nerburn has lived and worked among the Native American people. Voices in the Stones is a unique collection of his encounters, experiences, and reflections during that time. He takes us inside a traditional Native feast to show us how the children are taught to respect the elders. He brings us to an isolated prairie rock outcropping where a young Native man and his father show us how the power of ceremony connects the present with the ancient voices of the past. At a dusty roadside café he introduces us to an elder who remembers the time when his ancestors could talk to animals. In these and other deeply touching stories, Nerburn reveals the spiritual awareness that animates all of Native American life, and shows us how we have much to learn from one another if only we have the heart to listen. Kent Nerburn is widely recognized as one of the few American writers who can respectfully bridge the gap between Native and non-Native cultures. He is the author of 16 books on spirituality and Native themes.\n\nThe Way Under the Way: The Place of True Meeting, by Mark Nepo (Sounds True), 328 pages –When we shift from trying to be special to seeking what is special in everything, we discover “the way under the way “– the timeless terrain of that mysterious force which animates and unites us.

Evolving these further, Mark Nepo integrates nearly 60 new poems into the thematic reach of the material. The Way Under the Way presents a wholly new work, centered on “the place of true meeting that is always near” and the natural rhythms of opening and closing that can become the art that keeps us vital. “All we ever need is right where we are, if we can open the ordinary treasure that is always before us,” writes Mark Nepo. The Way Under the Way is an invitation to “ignite your own exploration of the nature and workings of the inner life.”"
