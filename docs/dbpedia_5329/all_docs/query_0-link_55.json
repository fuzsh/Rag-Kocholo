Years before \"manifestation,\" \"the law attraction,\" and \"the secret\" entered the lexicon, Gawain was sharing daily affirmations, meditations, and mental imagery practices that millions found could help them achieve goals, change habits, relax deeply and significantly improve overall health and well-being. This anniversary edition introduces a new generation to the simple and clear writing style, vivid examples, and concise sections and chapters that make Creative Visualization easy to read and apply to one's personal needs and wants. Whether it is read for generalized inspiration and empowerment or to achieve specific goals (financial, creative, medical, etc.), Creative Visualization remains a profoundly powerful resource and Gawain a uniquely warm and wise teacher.",
