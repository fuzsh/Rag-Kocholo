        "text": "The Hague, Netherlands – 31 July 2024 – The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) has selected Astana, Kazakhstan to host the 2025 World Library and Information Congress from 18-22 August 2025.\n\nThis is the first ever edition of IFLA’s flagship event to be held in Central Asia and reinforces IFLA’s role in developing the international library field.\n\nAfter a year with no Congress, we know that there is a great desire from our members and volunteers to meet in person again. Yet beyond this, WLIC has a unique power to catalyse energy and growth in host countries and regions, as well as to offer new perspectives for all participants.\n\nMeeting in Astana will provide an exceptional opportunity for discovery and learning for colleagues in a unique region of the world with a rich cultural history.\n\n“We know that the library world looks to IFLA to provide the space to come together across all sectors and areas of our profession, and celebrate what we share. The IFLA Governing Board highly valued the work of our colleagues in Kazakhstan to prepare their bid, and their ambition for both the Congress and its legacy in the country and region.”\n\nVicki McDonald, IFLA President\n\nBuilding on ideas already emerging from the ongoing WLIC Review, IFLA WLIC 2025 will incorporate different concepts, from peer-learning and on-the-ground case studies to high-level thought leaders challenging our assumptions. Astana itself is a modern city, and one which highlights Kazakhstan’s rich and vital cultural heritage.\n\n“By hosting a successful WLIC, we aim to improve the professional level of local librarians and the way the library profession is seen in society. We want to bring the library and information professional communities in Kazakhstan and Central Asia together and strengthen our participation in the international landscape. And, of course, foreign participants will be able to learn about the fascinating history, cultural traditions and politics of our region. A warm welcome awaits.”\n\nGulzhan Irzhanova, President Association of University Libraries of the Republic of Kazakhstan\n\nWe will be sharing more about plans for WLIC 2025 in the coming months and at the IFLA Information Futures Summit in Brisbane from 30 September to 3 October 2024. We look forward to welcoming colleagues from Kazakhstan to the Summit."
