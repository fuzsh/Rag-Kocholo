Most of the rest of the book is taken up with the action-packed \"The Mad King,\" during which Val, back at Camelot, confronts the evil, fat little King Tourien of Cornwall.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHal Foster (1892-1982) created Prince Valiant in 1937. Though remaining involved with the strip until his death in 1982, Foster handed the bulk of the scripting and art chores over to his longtime assistant, John Cullen Murphy, in 1971."
