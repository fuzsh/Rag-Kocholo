        "text": "In 1585, the first British colony in North America was established on Roanoke Island, off the coast of what is now North Carolina. The colony was not a success, lasting only about a year before the colonists returned to England. However, the information that these colonists brought back was helpful in the planning of future expeditions, and was also of great interest to people throughout Europe who were anxious to learn more about the “new world.” Two of the colonists were particularly effective in describing their experiences. Thomas Hariot published a description of the area and its inhabitants, and John White painted vivid watercolors of the plants, animals, and people of North America.\n\nStories about North America, in particular the native inhabitants of the large area then named Virginia, excited popular interest in Europe. Thomas Hariot’s engaging description of Virginia and the Native Americans who lived there was published in 1588 as A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (available online through Documenting the American South). Shortly after this was published, Theodore De Bry, a Belgian goldsmith and engraver, began work on an illustrated edition. Working directly from John White’s watercolors, De Bry made a series of engravings, primarily of Native Americans. Twenty-seven of these were included in the illustrated edition of the Briefe and True Report, published in Frankfort in 1590. This book was published in English, French, German, and Latin editions, giving people throughout Europe their first look at images of North America, and of Native Americans."
