        "text": "Calling all ebook and audiobook fans! Wild New World is this season’s Big Library Read title. Starting May 9, you can immediately borrow Dan Flores’ Wild New World on the Libby app or by visiting https://flls.overdrive.com/. Big Library Read is an opportunity for FLLS library card holders to read the same digital title at the same time without any wait lists or holds. It’s a worldwide digital version of a local book club!\n\nWild New World Book Blurb:\n\nWinner of the 2023 Rachel Carson Environment Book Award\n\nWinner of the 2023 National Outdoor Book Award for Natural History Literature\n\nIn 1908, near Folsom, New Mexico, a cowboy discovered the remains of a herd of extinct giant bison. By examining flint points embedded in the bones, archeologists later determined that a band of humans had killed and butchered the animals 12,450 years ago. This discovery vastly expanded America’s known human history but also revealed the long-standing danger Homo sapiens presented to the continent’s evolutionary richness.\n\nDistinguished author Dan Flores’s ambitious history chronicles the epoch in which humans and animals have coexisted in the “wild new world” of North America—a place shaped both by its own grand evolutionary forces and by momentous arrivals from Asia, Africa, and Europe. With portraits of iconic creatures such as mammoths, horses, wolves, and bison, Flores describes the evolution and historical ecology of North America like never before."
