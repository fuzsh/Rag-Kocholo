All I need to know is that I’ve made a positive impact on someone’s life — that makes it all worthwhile.”\n\nHe is a renowned author of numerous books including The Greatest Secret Of All, Visionary Business, The Millionaire Course, The Type-Z Guide To Success and one of my all time favorite books The Magical Path … Creating The Life Of Your Dreams And A World That Works For Us All.Marc has recorded several albums, is a poet, well known speaker and seminar leader.\n\nNew World Library was founded by Marc on his 30th birthday and has since published some phenomenal best sellers such as Eckhart Tolle’s The Power Of Now, Deepak Chopra’s The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, Sark’s Succulent Wild Love and Lee Harris’s Energy Speaks just to name a few.Come journey with us through this magical podcast and discover how you can manifest your goals and dreams, even the really BIG ones with ease, fun and what appears to be pure magic.\n\nMarc “spills the tea” on success!",
