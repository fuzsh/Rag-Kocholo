        "text": "Irish Hill Cemetery is located on upper Main Street in Cooperstown, this section of the village is known as Irish Hill. It is a Catholic cemetery, very well maintained and easily accessible. When I became Otsego Town Historian, I attempted to locate a record of those buried in this cemetery, I was unable to do this, so I have compiled a list of the tombstones existing in 1999. A few are illegible but many are in remarkably good condition. I believe there is an earlier record and if I do locate it, I will make necessary additions to this. Because this is an alphabetical listing, I have indicated when individuals are buried with a family having a different surname. The maiden names of wives are capitalized and daughter is abbreviated as dau.
