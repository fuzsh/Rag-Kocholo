He attended Vernon-Verona-Sherrill High School before deciding to work full time on his family farm.\n\nJames had a love of fast cars and hunting. He spent his younger years drag racing at Utica-Rome Speedway, racing around town and out-running Chief Murphy as his many stories entailed. He was nicknamed “The Great White Hunter” which he took much pride in. James knew almost everything there was to know about hunting. His favorite room in his house was his “dead room”, filled with his many mounted animals and pictures of his hunts. He served as the director of the Vernon Rod and Gun club for 30+ years!\n\nJames spent his life working on his family farm farm with his father. Carrying on the farm after his fathers passing with his love, Linda. Together they worked hard until their retirement in 2000. Though he was retired you could still catch him in a tractor every spring. Helping his fellow farmers was one of his favorite past times.\n\nSince the passing of his wife, James took up a new hobby of collecting antique horse drawn plows. He was very proud of his collection and even joked that he was the president of the Vernon Center Plow Company.\n\nJames leaves behind two daughters; Holly (Mike Foster) Prendergast of Madison and Sheri Cronin of Vernon Center. Grandchildren; Kayla Bourne of Vernon Center, Erik Foster of Madison and Samantha (Joshua) Gaudin of Munnsville. Five great-grandchildren; Adriona Bourne, Autumn Gaudin, Brooklynn Gaudin, Chloe Gaudin and Dominick Francis Gaudin. A sister, Doris (Donald) Clinch of Vernon Center. Many nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. And a very special cousin, his best friends, Charles “Junie” Burke of Vernon Center.\n\nJames was pre-deceased by his wife Linda, his parents Francis and Bertha and a great-granddaughter; Marley Foster.\n\nJames loved his friends, family and himself as he always liked to say. He could always be found laughing and smiling with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren who called him “Boppa”.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to call on Thursday, March 23, 2023 from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. at the Malecki Funeral Home, 23 Front Street, Vernon, NY.
