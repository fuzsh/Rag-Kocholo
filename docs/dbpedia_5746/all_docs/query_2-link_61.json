        "text": "Val Logsdon Fitch (born March 10, 1923, Merriman, Nebraska, U.S.—died February 5, 2015, Princeton, New Jersey) was an American particle physicist who was corecipient, with James Watson Cronin, of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1980 for experiments conducted in 1964 that disproved the long-held theory that particle interaction should be indifferent to the direction of time.\n\nFitch’s early interest in chemistry shifted to physics in the mid-1940s when, as a member of the U.S. Army, he was sent to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to work on the Manhattan Project. He graduated from McGill University in Montreal with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1948 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics by Columbia University in 1954. That year he joined the faculty of Princeton University, and he later served (1976–81) as chair of its physics department; in 1987 he was named the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science"
