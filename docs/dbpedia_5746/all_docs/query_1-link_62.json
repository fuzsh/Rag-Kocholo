        "text": "James Michael Anthony Francis William Patrick Cronin, 84, was born at St. Mary’s Hospital in Superior, Wisconsin, to Cecil and Katherine (Scwentkofske) Cronin on John Avenue. Jim attended Cathedral School (Go Panthers!), run by the School Sisters of Saint Francis. He served as an altar boy at the Cathedral of Christ the King, reluctantly purchased and delivered wine for Sister Henriella upon request, and still claims his sister stole, not borrowed, his bicycle.\n\nJim passed away on Saturday evening, April 20, at Mayo Clinic Health System Hospital in Eau Claire. He enlisted and served in the U.S. Air Force at Lackland in Texas and Elmendorff in Alaska (now Joint Base Elmendorff-Richardson). After graduating with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, Jim held various sales positions with Univac, Xerox, Compugraphic, and Kell Container Corporation. He met his wife, Frances Lamb, during his leave from the USAF while she attended UW Superior. They were married in 1965 and shared 58 years.\n\nJim is survived by his wife, Fran of Eau Claire, Wisconsin; son, Paul of Atlanta, Georgia; sister, Judy; and brother-in-law, Richard Campbell of Superior, Wisconsin. His nieces and nephews include Lisa Bouvine, Jim Campbell, Marc Campbell, Michele Dumonseau, who all reside in Superior. Over the years, Jim forged many connections in his profession and lifelong friendships in his community. He was a longtime member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, loved engaged conversations, and always left others smiling. He enjoyed many adventures, including fishing, boating, hunting, golfing, and spending seasonal time at the family cabin along Nelson Lake in Hayward, Wisconsin.\n\nVisitation will be from 10 until the 11:00 a.m. Mass of Christian Burial, Friday, April 26, 2024, at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Superior. The Very Reverend Father James Tobolski will be the celebrant.\n\nThe burial will be in Calvary Cemetery, Superior.\n\nTo sign the online guest book or send condolences, visit www.downsfh.com"
