Without the phenomenon, known as charge-parity violation, no matter could exist in the universe.\n\nCronin was born on Sept. 29, 1931, in Chicago.\n\n\"He inspired us all to reach further into the unknown with deep intuition, solid scientific backing and poetic vision,\" said Angela Olinto, the Homer J. Livingston Distinguished Service Professor in Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\n\"He accepted his many recognitions and accolades with so much humility that he encouraged many generations to follow his vision.\""
