        "meta_description": "It is with heavy hearts, we mourn the passing of James Daniel Cronin on Tuesday, October 4, 2016.  Jim passed peacefully at his home surrounded by the love of his family, at the age of 72.  The world is a little less bright for those of us who knew and loved him.  He was truly a good man.  Jim was kind and thoughtful, full of laughter and ready to help out in a moment’s notice.  He was a quiet man with integrity, whose word was his bond.  His passion was farming, especially his cattle.    He was born December 23, 1943 in Seaforth, Ontario, to Albert & Eileen (Eckert) Cronin.  Jim was a loving husband to his wife Karen (Pletch) for 47 years.  Treasured father of Lori Parsons (Paul), Julie Hoekstra (Dwayne), Michelle Jeffery (Stu), Gary Cronin (Lindsay) and Kari Cronin Soleski (Mark).  Proud Grandpa & Papa of Steve, Scott, Jason, Luke, Logan, Blake, Kirsten, Erika, Kaitlyn, Eloise, James and baby Soleski due in January.  Beloved brother and brother-in-law of Mary Smith, Steve & Nancy Cronin, Jerry & Heather Cronin, Joanne Regier, Don & Connie Pletch, Steve & Barb Pletch & Jim Hogan.  Son-in-law of Edna Pletch.  He was predeceased by his father-in-law Tom Pletch, brothers-in-laws Leo Smith, Dave Regier and sister-in-law Bonnie Hogan.  Jim will be sorely missed by his family, friends and community.   Visitation will be held at McGlynn Family Funeral Home, 87 Goderich St. W., Seaforth, 519-527-1390, on Friday, October 7th from 2-4 and 7-9 p.m. (with Parish Prayers at 1:45 p.m. Friday).
