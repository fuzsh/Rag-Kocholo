        "text": "For the rugby player, see James Cronin (rugby union).\n\nFor other people with similar names, see Jim Cronin.\n\nJames Watson Cronin (September 29, 1931 â€“ August 25, 2016[1]) was an American particle physicist.[2][3]\n\nQuick Facts Born, Died ...\n\nClose\n\nCronin and co-researcher Val Logsdon Fitch were awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics for a 1964 experiment that proved that certain subatomic reactions do not adhere to fundamental symmetry principles. Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of kaons, that a reaction run in reverse does not merely retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the interactions of subatomic particles are not invariant under time reversal. Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered.[4][5][6][7][excessive citations]\n\nCronin received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1976 for major experimental contributions to particle physics including fundamental work on weak interactions culminating in the discovery of asymmetry under time reversal. In 1999, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.[8]"
