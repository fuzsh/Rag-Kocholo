Mr. T. Lehane (instructed by Mr. E. W.

Defendant commenced boarding at the hotel In March last, and was known to Mrs. Gracey for about a year. There was a lobby just inside the main entrance to the hotel in which was a pianola. There was also a stairway to the upper story from the lobby, and a stairway at the back of the hotel. Near room 7, in which tile fire occurred, there was a tank stand. Defendant occupied room No. 11 on the day of the fire. He was in bed most of the day, but got up for tea. He went over to another hotel, and had a conversation with some people and returned about 8 p.m. At the time the postmaster at Cooyar was playing the pianola, and was with his wife entertaining some friends. Defendant remained in the stairway listening to the music, and later went to his room. To get there he would have to pass room 7. The room contained the usual furniture. The post-master and friends left the hotel at 9 p.m. Mrs. Gracey then gave a man a drink at the back door, and inside immediately after her attention was attracted to a flickering light. She rushed to room 7, in which the light appeared to be, and knocked. Receiving no reply, she opened the door and found the room in flames. There was a strong smell of kerosene. She rushed out on to the balcony to get some water. Defendant was then in bed, apparently awake. She took a jug or water from his room. The fire was extinguished before much damage was done. In the drawer of the duchess in room 7 there was a bottle partly filled with kerosene. Defendant was questioned, but denied that he had any inflammable material in his possession. A bottle of petrol also was found behind the door. There were no corks in the bottles, and none were found In room 7. On being questioned, defendant denied any knowledge of the fire. The next morning Constable Yesberg went to the defendant's room, where the latter admitted that the portmanteau found in his room was his property. In it were two bottles of petrol. The bottles found in room 7 were sent to the C.I.B., Brisbane, where fingerprints on them were found to be in agreement with those of the defendant.\n\nAfter, evidence had been given by Constable Yesberg the court adjourned until this morning.
