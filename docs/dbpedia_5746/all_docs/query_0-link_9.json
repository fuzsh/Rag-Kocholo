        "text": "(1931–2016). American particle physicist James Cronin was the corecipient with Val Logsdon Fitch of the 1980 Nobel Prize for Physics for an experiment that implied that reversing the direction of time would not precisely reverse the course of certain reactions of subatomic particles.\n\nJames Watson Cronin was born on September 29, 1931, in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from Southern Methodist University at Dallas, Texas, in 1951 and received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1955. He then joined the staff of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York, and in 1958 became a professor at Princeton University.\n\nCronin and his colleague Fitch played a role in modifying the long-held notion that the laws of symmetry and conservation are inviolable. One of these laws, the principle of time invariance (designated T), states that particle interactions should be indifferent to the direction of time. This symmetry and two others, those of charge conjugation (C) and parity conservation (P), were once thought to govern all the laws of physics. But in 1956 the physicists Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested, correctly, that parity conservation could be violated by particle decays involving weak interactions. Physicists abandoned the view that C, P, and T are independently true for weak interactions but saved the overall concept by proposing that any P violation must be offset by an equal C violation, a concept known as CP symmetry.\n\nIn a series of experiments conducted at Brookhaven in 1964, Cronin and Fitch showed that in rare instances, subatomic particles called K mesons violate CP symmetry during their decay. In 1971 Cronin was appointed professor of physics at the University of Chicago. Cronin died on August 25, 2016, in St. Paul, Minnesota."
