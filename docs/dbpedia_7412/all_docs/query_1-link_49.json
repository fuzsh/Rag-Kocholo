        "text": "Ian Zamora is a California surfer/shaper. Growing up in the Phillipines, Ian has since been playing catch-up with the surf lifestyle he has grown to love. Under the tutelage of Rich Pavel and Glen Kennedy, he has quickly carved his own niche in the surfing industry. We spoke with Ian to learn more.\n\nWhat was your life like growing up?\n\nI spent the first 13 years of my life in the Philippines. We had a small beach resort out in the country, so I had a lot of time to stare at empty white sand beaches with no waves. Moving to California was a big change in my life—trying to fit in, bouncing back and forth with sports, etc. Until I was a late teen, I had no involvement with surfing whatsoever.\n\nAfter high school, I was working with elderly people and working at hot rod shops. A few friends dragged me to the beach to go surfing. Since then, my life has been in warp speed trying to catch up for the years I missed out on with the lifestyle.\n\nWhen did you get your first surfboard?\n\nI learned on a board borrowed from a friend for a few months, then finally bought a used… Lost Speed demon board at the Ventura Surf shop. I think I paid $120 for it. I surfed that thing ’til it died. My first custom board was from a local shaper that became one of my mentors—Glen Kennedy.\n\nWhat was the feeling you had when you first stood on a surfboard?\n\nFirst time I stood up, I fell right off. I wanted to catch more! The first time I stood up and legitimately rode a wave was the day before I bought my first used board. (Laughs)\n\nWho did you look up to and admire when you were a young man?\n\nBecause I had such a different upbringing without any involvement in surfing, I was an avid basketball and baseball player, and looked up to basketball and baseball stars of the time, but was never really interested in mimicking any specific player. Once I discovered surfing, I admired Taylor Knox for his disciplined approach and powerful style.\n\nOf all the places you have traveled to, what place in particular stands out and why?\n\nEach of the great places that I have been fortunate to visit holds a special place in me. Australia, Portugal, England, Bali, Hawaii, etc. all stand out in their own special way, so no particular place stands out.\n\nWho or what inspires you?\n\nCarla, family, people that are ready to lend a helping hand, anyone that pushes surfing and surfboard progression while still appreciating the history and old school traditional ways (like the art of trim, glide and flow).\n\nAs far as surfboard design and construction, I’ve been inspired by Glen Kennedy, Rich Pavel and the diverse crew of craftsmen that are pushing surfboard design to the next level—not to mention all the laminators, sanders, polishers and fin guys who are constantly innovating their techniques.\n\nWhen did you start shaping?\n\nI think its about seven to eight years since I started shaping. I was working at Kennedy Surfboards’ retail shop and I wanted to try out more boards, but just couldn’t afford it. One day, I asked Glen if I can buy a blank off him. Took it home that afternoon and started shaping it. I think I used our trash cans as stands and demolished our backyard with foam dust. A month later, I asked my parents if I could turn part of the garage into a shaping room. That’s when I knew I was sucked in to building surfboards.\n\nTell us about your boards.\n\nThe boards I shape are the boards I ride, but with the help of our team, we are constantly expanding, experimenting and dialing in our working quiver. If you can imagine it, I can shape it.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you have learned in your life?\n\nThere are a lot more things to learn out in the world than in a small room in school.\n\nDo you have any regrets or wish you had done something differently?\n\nIf I could have change something? I would have started surfing earlier in life.\n\nWhat meaning does surfing hold for you and how has it changed your life?\n\nSurfing and its lifestyle has played a really important role in my life. I’ve met my other half (Carla Rowland), some great friends and traveled to places I always dreamed of.\n\nWhat is your favorite board? Your favorite surf spot?\n\nI’m fortunate that I get to play around with a lot of new designs. My favorite board constantly changes, but at the moment it’s my orange channel bottomed Twin Arc Tail Quad. My favorite surf spots would be First Point Malibu and Leo Carrillo—perfect testing grounds for new ideas.\n\nWhat’s your favorite meal?\n\nI’m Filipino… I eat ‘em all!\n\nWhat are you currently listening to on your iPod?\n\nMy iPod got stolen, along with a couple surfboards, from my van in my driveway. Pandora is usually on while driving—Tristan Prettyman, Stone Mason, Sara Bareilles, Lani Trock, Adele, Jason Mraz. I’m diggin’ the raw sound of live acoustic tracks right now.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nI am most grateful for Carla for standing by me and pushing me to do what am capable of, and my family for supporting and believing in me. And everyone that has continued to support us in this business.\n\nWhat’s next for Ian Zamora?\n\nIt’s the time of the year where we get to travel again. Japan in May, Italy and Europe in September. New possibilities and opportunities with the new factory. Stay tuned!\n\nFind out more about Ian Zamora and his shapes here.\n\nLiz Clark is a California surfer who travels the Pacific on a boat named Swell. Choosing a life on the ocean allows Liz to discover new cultures and to be able to find and ride that perfect wave. After corresponding for months, we finally caught up with her.\n\nWhat was it like growing up in California?\n\nI was lucky to grow up in some nice areas of San Diego, usually near the beach or open space. My favorite spot was in Del Mar, where we lived during most of my high school years. My parents rented a place one house back from the beach on 24th St and I had a pack of super fun friends and neighbors. That house became our ‘hub’ because my parents were so relaxed and easy-going. I remember lots of beach break beatings learning to surf, hot sand, riding bikes, summer high tide body surfs, sneaking into local jacuzzis, harassing the poor lifeguards, food in the fridge, lots of freedom…not too much to complain about.\n\nWhen did you get your first surfboard?\n\nI was 14 at the time. I’d saved up money in a little green box in my bedroom at our house in Point Loma where we lived then. One day, I got my big brother, James, to drive me to South Coast Surfboards in Ocean Beach. I went in and told the guy I wanted to learn to surf. He pointed me to a yellow 8’4” Encinitas Surfboards egg, and I handed him a wad of assorted cash from the green box. I don’t remember exactly why I felt so strongly about becoming a surfer, as no one in my family or close friend group surfed at the time. It all of a sudden just grabbed me after meeting this girl, Renee, at school, who surfed. I was a competitive gymnast for many years, but by that time, I was getting bored with it and ready for something new.\n\nWhat was the feeling you had when you first stood on a surfboard?\n\nI took a taxi to the beach from our house in Point Loma to the jetties in Ocean Beach shortly after buying that board. I had no idea what I was doing, I just walked out into the waves, looking at all the surfers out on the outside, and tried to catch the whitewash. I remember feeling elated after finally getting to my feet and going ‘straight’ in until the fin hit the sand.\n\nWho did you look up to and admire when you were a young girl?\n\nMy father was always my biggest hero. I also really looked up to my gymnastics coach, Darryl Davis, and many of my schoolteachers, Mrs. Gibbs, Mr. Freeze, Mrs. Arn, Mrs. Castruita… and after reading Dove and Maiden Voyage, both books about sailing around the world when I was 12 or 13, I was in love with Robin Lee Graham, and totally admired Tania Aebi. I was never one of those girls that had posters of the Backstreet Boys on their walls.\n\nOf all the places you have traveled to, what place in particular stands out? And why?\n\nI’ve loved them all, but Kiribati probably, the most. It was like going back in time, true subsistence living and culturally very much in tact, homes built all out of palm and pandanus, hardly any contact to the outside world, amazingly resourceful and friendly people, healthy reef ecosystems, and some incredible waves too.\n\nWho/what inspires you?\n\nThe natural world is probably my most constant source of inspiration. As far as people who inspire me, there’s way too many to name…but to start: my Mom, Audrey Sutherland, St. Mother Teresa, Pema Chodron, Amma, Ghandi, Martin Luther King Jr., Amelia Earhart, Helen Keller, H.D. Thoreau, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Bernard Motesseir, Joshua Slocum, Yvon Chouinard, Tom Curren, Keoni Cuccia, Taylor Knox, Greg Long, Bethany Hamilton, Thich Nhat Hanh, Thor Heyerdahl, Jesus, Buddha, Allah, and Jah, and any person who follows their heart with good intentions for the world…\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you have learned in your life?\n\nOur lives are a reflection of our thoughts–focus on love, gratitude, and the positive side…\n\nDo you have any regrets or wish you had done something differently?\n\nThere was this one wave at Jalama last year that I pulled back on…no, kidding, I made a heck of a lot of mistakes, but no, I don’t have any big regrets, all of them were just part of the learning process.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nMy cut biceps… no, kidding… my love for my family and friends, and the planet.\n\nWhat meaning does surfing hold for you and how has it changed your life?\n\nSurfing is a sacred space for me. It has brought me unfathomable joy, self-confidence, independence, and a fantastic reason to sail around the world. My passion for it almost gets unbearable at times, but I feel so lucky to love something so strongly. And even luckier to be living my dream of surfing around the world on my own boat!\n\nWhat brings you the most happiness in the world?\n\nBeing with my family when everyone’s in a good mood and perfectly barreling rights without a crowd.\n\nWho are some of the people you feel are shaping the path for surfing today?\n\nThe surfing ‘path’ that I like most is being shaped by Dane Reynolds, Dan Malloy, Greg Long, Bethany Hamilton, Carissa Moore, Julian Wilson, Brian Conley, Dave Rastovich, Belinda Baggs…\n\nTell us about your relationship with Patagonia.\n\nPatagonia has helped support my voyage since 2005. I feel great knowing that my biggest sponsor is one of the most environmentally active and aware companies on the planet. I only see our relationship getting stronger as my own voice as an adventurer, environmental activist, and nature conservationist gets louder. It’s run by a collection of amazing people and Yvon Chouinard, himself, is a true living legend – a pioneer in thought, business, and conservation (not to mention how he changed the world of climbing). A radical guy with a great sense of humor. I’m proud to be part of the Patagonia family.\n\nWhat is in your current quiver? What is your favorite board? Your favorite surfspot?\n\nBeing in the South Pacific for the last few years– mostly steep, heavy waves. It seems I’m always on my thrusters. Jason Feist, of J7 Surfboards, in Santa Barbara has been my main shaper since 2001. I’ve got my essential J7 thrusters—a 5’9”, 5’11’, 6’4”, 6’8”, and 6’10”. Then I’ve got two quads, a 5’4” fish and a 5’9” heavier glass pintail quad both shaped by my friend in Nexpa, Paul Lyle. And a fat twinnie that another long-time friend and shaper, Sean Tully made. Fletcher at FCDesigns recently made me a magical 5’9” epoxy round tail and a beautiful 9’6” longboard, too. I’d love to get an alaia after having a go on Crystal Thornburg’s alaia in Hawaii last year. Lately I’ve been into bodysurfing a lot, too.\n\nSoooooo many waves great waves out there, but my favorite’s a secret…\n\nWhat’s your favorite meal?\n\nI love spinach, blueberries, walnuts, curry, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, coconut milk, honey, ginger, and tea. Top any meal off with chocolate lava cake and it’s my favorite.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to on your iPod?\n\nAlthea and Donna, Gentlemen, M.I.A., Herb Alpert, Hooverphonic, Alpha Blondy, Arcade Fire, Hank Williams, Paul Simon, Bonnie Tyler, Beethoven, Beirut, Blue King Brown, Marcia Griffiths, Brigitte Bardot, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Jackson Browne, Deep Forest, Dezarie, Diana Ross, Dr, Alimentado, Lutan Fyah, Horace Andy, Jimmy Buffett, Joan Jett, Le Tigre, Todd Hannigan, Michael Franti, Midnite, Quantic, Scissor Sisters, Sean Hayes, Sigur Ros, Stevie Wonder just to start… music is my lifeline out here.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nThe love of my family and friends, and the people who believed in me.\n\nWhat’s next for Liz Clark?\n\nNow that I finally fixed the leak in Swell’s hull, I’ll be continuing west on my voyage, through the Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Kiribati, New Zealand…?? Wherever the wind blows me, I guess, and keep sharing my love for the planet with the world. I’m working on a book that will be published next year, so that’s been quite a learning process and helped greatly to improve my writing skills. I feel very inspired to continue my yoga and meditation practice, keep encouraging people to live out their passions, and look beyond the hype to seek peace, truth, and more sustainable ways of living.\n\nFollow Liz Clark and the Voyage of Swell here. Photography by Pete Hodgson.\n\nPablo Ugartetxea is a Spanish artist/surfer living in the Basque region. Inspired by surf culture, his paintings are complex compositions of mixed media that feature photographs, drawing, and paint. We caught up with Pablo to find out more.\n\nWhat was it like growing up in Spain?\n\nI had quite a normal childhood. I grew up in Bilbao, an industrial city in Northern Spain where, thankfully, you can take the tube to go surfing. My family is originally from Lekeitio, a beautiful town near Mundaka where I used to enjoy myself a lot during the summer, living in a big house surrounded by my punk cousins.\n\nWhat was the feeling you had when you first stood on a surfboard?\n\nI remember my first wave perfectly well. It was unreal to see the beach from up there. I was going so fast! I was stoked immediately. I wanted more and more!!!\n\nWho did you look up to and admire when you were a young man?\n\nWhen I was a young man, I loved comics—Tintin, Corto Maltes, Moebius and, of course, Wilbur Kookmeyer!\n\nThe art scene—I remember when I discovered Picasso. It was like a revelation, all the fun and crazy stuff you could do with a paintbrush. Rock and roll—The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Janis Joplin, the Velvet Underground, roots reggae. In literature, I liked Hermann Hesse, On the Road by Jack Kerouac. In surfing, I admired Tom Curren.\n\nOf all the interesting places you have traveled to, what place in particular stands out? And why?\n\nI like the Mediterranean very much; I travel to Greece as much as I can. Greece is the origin of Western culture and the light there is amazing. I’m in love with California as well. It has many similarities with Greece—the light—and also because it was the center of an ever-ruling culture. I like French and Japanese sophistication, the color and the magic in India, the Cuban sense of humor. I don’t know … I love many different places.\n\nWhere were you educated?\n\nI studied at a Jesuit catholic school in Bilbao beginning in 1973, when Franco’s régime was already agonizing the people. The good thing was my passion for drawing helped me to survive the extremely boring classes. My name starts with a U, therefore I always sat in the last row, out of the teacher’s visual reach, and I could escape by filling my books and notebooks with perfect lineups, sexy California blondes and piers like the one at Huntington. When I finished school, I studied arts at the university in Bilbao, London and Amsterdam.\n\nTell us about your wonderful paintings. What do you hope to evoke with them?\n\nMy work mixes drawing, photography, oil and textures. I don’t believe in disciplines within different arts and techniques; I like to bring reality out of context, always with a great dose of humor. Having sense of humor is the best antidepressant and I use it compulsively.\n\nOver the last few years, big waves have taken over my paintings. Now I combine city architecture with tsunamis, trying to obtain poetic images with a strong ironic and disturbing charge. There is a latent threat in my paintings. You can feel the catastrophe—buildings in flames, humongous waves destroying cities. I think this has to do with the dramatic new millennium we’re living in: crazy weather causing hurricanes in Europe, the collapse of western economy, 9/11, the latest dreadful earthquakes. It all causes an apocalyptic atmosphere that an artist cannot ignore. For me, a tsunami is a metaphor which invites us to think about human impact on nature and, at the same time, the impact of nature on populated areas—for example, how nature throws the ball back with all its strength, destroying our concrete monsters.\n\nLast year, during my exhibition in San Sebastian on the occasion of this Basque city’s Surf Film Festibal, I came up with the term “Surfbanismo”. Surfbanism means urbanizing or, rather, “disurbanizing” through tsunamis, destroying all those horrendous maritime promenades and apartment buildings. In these creations, or should I say “destructions,” I have let the anarchist in me flow freely and I have to admit it was quite a pleasant experience.\n\nWho or what inspires you?\n\nArchitecture, the sea, the light and the ocean. I find these sources of inspiration traveling as much as I can and taking thousands of shots. Back in my studio, I compose the cities my own way. I remove and add. I assemble different parts. I cut and paste mentally, painting imaginary cities which always have the ocean in the background. Through my painting, I can give priority to imagination, to the subversion of reality, to poetry. I feel like a billionaire and almighty city mayor who transforms the city as he pleases.\n\nFor my last exhibition in Bilbao, I completely reshaped my city. I replaced the stinking mud in the river with an epic white sand beach from Indonesia and I chucked the iconic Rio de Janeiro mountain of Pao d’Açucar in the middle, changing the grey costumes and executive suitcases worn by Bilbao citizens for swimming suits and surfboards.\n\nIn my paintings for The Surf Gallery in Laguna Beach, I bring the waves from Venice Beach to the channels in Venice, bay watcher cars pass through the Big Channel and there’s a huge wall painting of Jim Morrison on an old Venice palace. Amongst all artists who have inspired me, I would point to David Hockney and Andy Warhol for their creativity, Matisse’s color and, of course, Picasso’s genius.\n\nWhat code or “golden rule” do you live by?\n\nTo be myself, to try and be true to myself.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you have learned in your life?\n\nTo focus on things you really believe in and not to waste time with bullshit. Like André Guide once wrote, “Dogs bark, cart keeps going.”\n\nDo you have any regrets or wish you had done something differently?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nI’m proud of earning a living doing what I like to do most.\n\nWhat meaning does surfing hold for you and how has it changed your life?\n\nSurfing makes me constantly be outdoors, in touch with nature, with people who think that money and material things are not their priorities in life. And you can’t forget it provides a perfect tan all year!!\n\nWhat brings you the most happiness in the world?\n\nWhen I catch a good wave or when I finish a good painting. In both cases, I feel extremely satisfied. It’s something priceless.\n\nWhat is in your current quiver?\n\nRight now, I am stoked on a couple of eggs—a singlefin and a 2+1—and a quad, all of them around seven feet.\n\nWhat is your favorite board?\n\nA seven foot quad made by a Brazilian shaper who lives around here. I did the colour myself—a beautiful bluish grey. It looks wonderful in the water, but very difficult to come up with when I need to repair the board! My next board will be white!!\n\nI love to surf Les Estagnots (Hossegor), Biarritz, San Onofre, Portugal and the Mediterranean. Last summer, I caught a big swell on the island of Sardegna.\n\nWhat’s your favorite meal?\n\nI am Basque. This is a country with a huge gastronomy tradition, where men gather in private clubs to cook, where cooking is the most common subject to speak about, like others speak about the weather. To make it simple, we’re obsessed with food in general and particularly fish. I love to cook and to eat, but I have to admit that despite all this Basque cuisine tradition, my favorite food is a good hot dog!!\n\nWhat are you currently listening to on your iPod?\n\nRight now, I have Violent Femmes, The Cure, The Rolling Stones, Tchaikovsky, David Bowie, Ella Fitzgerald, Khaled, Beethoven, Gipsy Kings, Michael Jackson, Talking Heads, Duke Ellington, The Sex Pistols, Bob Dylan, Blondie, Lou Reed, Tequila, Stevie Wonder, JJ Cale, Neil Young, Tito Puente, Men At Work, Frank Sinatra, Mano Negra, Nino Rota, Marvin Gaye, Camaron de la Isla, Van Morrison, Skank, Jamie Cullum, Peter Tosh, Mongo Santamaria, Django Reinhardt, The Creedence, Charlie Parker. Actually, I’d like to be more up to date regarding music. Having taken a look at my list, I see all of them are grandpas or they have been pushing up daisies for awhile now.\n\nWhat causes, projects or organizations do you support?\n\nI collaborate with Premanande Orphanage Centre in Ongole , India, an orphanage created by a Hawaiian friend, John James, a great man. Within the surfing scene, I have done things with Surfrider Foundation.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nFor being healthy, for having had the chance to meet my wife, Ana, and for having something as valuable as imagination to create.\n\nWhat’s next for Pablo Ugartetxea?\n\nRight now, I’m finishing some paintings for the Green Room Festival in Yokohama, Japan in May. Also, there is an exhibition at the Sporting Casino in Hossegor and a huge 3D wall painting for a surf film festival.\n\nFind out more about Pablo Ugartetxea here.\n\nBy Chasen Marshall\n\nMikey DeTemple is an East Coast surfer/filmmaker who recently produced and directed the film “Picaresque.” A stylish longboarder, Mikey has won numerous pro contests and has graced the covers of Longboard Magazine and ESM. We spoke with Mikey to learn more.\n\nSo where and when did the Mikey DeTemple story begin?\n\nBorn (Aug. 30, 1983) and raised in Babylon, New York, which is in central Long Island, until I was 14. I was a part-time surfer for the most part; I surfed in the summers when it was warm. Back then, in the mid-‘90s they didn’t make winter suits for people my size, so I didn’t really get to surf in the winter. We spent the summers out in Montauk.\n\nWhen did surfing come into the picture?\n\nI didn’t start surfing until I was 12. My dad was one of the better surfers on Long Island in the ’70s, along with a handful of other guys. He surfed his entire life, and I was always around it, but I was never really all that into it. But one day it kind of clicked; it was actually my mom that got me into it. I think my dad always wanted me to surf really badly, like forcing it a little bit made me deter from it a bit. So I would always hang out at the beach with my mom, we used to go to the beach every day in the summer, regardless of what the weather was like. Eventually I just got sick of playing in the sand, so I started boogie boarding.\n\nWhat was your first board?\n\nIt was like a 5’6” Nomad, made here in Florida. It had these G&S one-star fins in it. It’s a pretty rad board; I’ve still got it actually. It was my dads. I guess he bought it on a trip down to Florida at some point in the late ’70s. It has like blue water droplets over it, like the old splash containers, it’s pretty amazing.\n\nI know you’ve had some health issues in the past, tell me a little bit about it.\n\nI was like 11 years old when it happened. I used to play ice-hockey and I broke one of my ribs while playing, I had to go to the hospital, and I guess it’s like hospital procedure to do an EKG on anyone who has a chest problem, and they found it on the EKG, and it was like the broken rib didn’t even matter anymore. They were tripping out. They found something called third-degree heart block, which is like an electrical problem with the natural electrical system of the heart, where the ventricles aren’t able to communicate with each other. So they wanted to do an emergency surgery that night and they ended up transferring me to a different hospital a couple hours later, to one with a much better pediatric unit, a couple hours away (Stony Brook University Medical Center). I was there for like five days.\n\nHow did that change your life?\n\nThey put me on heart monitors and the first month was kind of weird, doing all these tests and trying to figure out what they were going to do. They were trying to figure out whether to put a pacemaker in me. They came to the conclusion that it was asymptomatic, which basically means that I had what they found, but I didn’t show any symptoms of having it. So my doctor back then basically said, I don’t want to fix something that’s not broken, so we’re just going to do check ups every six months and see how you’re doing. He kind of guessed that once I got into my late teens or early twenties that I would start having some problems, that then they were going to have to put a pacemaker in. My first cardiologist completely nailed it, that’s exactly what happened. I was 19 when I started passing out and wasn’t asymptomatic anymore and was showing full signs of having third-degree heart block. That’s when they went and put the pacemaker in.\n\nAnd did that improve your quality of life?\n\nOh, gosh, it was night and day. I didn’t understand how I lived like that for so long. Right after I recovered from the surgery I had so much more energy, I was so much more alive, it was just completely, like I said, night and day. It was like getting a new engine or something.\n\nTalk a bit about the East Coast surfing scene. What sets it apart?\n\nIt’s so different, every little town, city, every state, I mean, the East Coast has 14 states that are touching the Atlantic, and each one is so different: Florida, which is like a hotbed for professional shortboarding; you go to Georgia which is a really weird 12 miles of coast, kind of rednecky; South Carolina, North Carolina. North Carolina has completely different types of waves, where it’s just dredging, barreling. You really get everything. You go up to New York City and there are stockbrokers surfing.\n\nWhen did you start taking surfing seriously, making it more than recreational?\n\nI moved to Florida when I was 14, my parents were just kind of over the cold of New York and the economy was pretty lousy there in the late ’90s. Things were just so dirt cheap in Florida, so they moved down here and bought a three-bedroom condo on the beach in Indialantic, near a pretty decent sandbar. I used to have to drive 40 minutes to get to the beach from my house in New York, so just being able to walk out back to surf was just the best thing ever. I would surf every single day. I would surf before school, after school, during school – without telling my parents [laughs]. I was surfing so much. I was surfing okay when I was living in New York, but with surfing every single day, whenever I wanted to, without any hesitation, it really started happening where I was progressing so much faster than in New York.\n\nWhat is it about surfing that makes it such a fixture in your life?\n\nI was just really brought up on the beach. And New York is just so different. In Florida and California, everyone really takes going to the beach for granted. In New York, you really kind of harness the beach and the weather, and how you really only get those three months out of the year to embrace the weather and the sand and the ocean and stuff. Otherwise, it’s just so brutally cold. I was always around the beach, my dad was a commercial fisherman, so, I’ve always been drawn to the ocean. It pretty much came natural.\n\nWhen did you decide to pursue the contest scene and make a career of sorts out of surfing?\n\nI used to do all the ESA (Eastern Surfing Association) contests in Florida, and there were some really good kids, and I started winning a couple of those contests. I started traveling a little bit more. When I was 15 I made the final of a pro contest, the Easter Surfing Festival at Cocoa Beach and Joel Tudor was in the final, and Dodger Kremel and, I think, Cody Simpkins, or someone like that, and I got second or third, something like that and I made $1,200 and I thought, I might be able to make a little bit of money doing this. Kind of got really motivated to try.\n\nHow and why did the movie-making thing come about?\n\nI was doing contests for so long, I would travel places with three of the same boards, three 9’0”s with three fins, one ounce glass, and I’d go to all these cool places and I’d do the contest and leave. Some of the sponsors I had at the time used to tell me, “When you’re done with the contest you go home, you don’t stay and hang out. We don’t pay for you to hang out, we pay for you to do well in contests.” I thought the whole contest and longboarding thing kind of started to get really lame. And I started to get really burnt out on where it was going, and the things that were being done. So I just thought, going to all these cool places that I’ve been, why not just go and surf all these places instead, and just do photo trips. I think it was on a photo trip to the Maldives like three years ago, and all we had was a photographer on the boat, and there were like five of us and the waves were insane, and I thought “Man, this would probably be one of the sickest video sections ever if someone was actually shooting! Why do I go on all these trips and no one ever shoots video or film?” I just started thinking I wanted to make something cool. It’s just going on trips and shooting sections of a movie in different locations and stuff.\n\nPicaresque was your first movie, which came out in 2008. What’d you learn from that experience?\n\nOh, man it was amazing. I didn’t know anything going into it. I basically have Dustin Miller to thank for even getting it done, because I was so clueless on half of the things I needed to do. I didn’t understand music licensing, or time lines or deadlines. I just knew I had a vision, and I knew what I wanted it to look like, but I didn’t know the backend stuff that goes into producing or directing a movie. Like I said, I knew what I wanted it to look like and I knew who I wanted to be in it, and I knew where I wanted to go, but that was really it. Actually doing it and having investors and having deadlines, I learned so much. I probably learned more working on that movie than had I gone to film school for four years.\n\nSo, is there another project on the way?\n\nYeah, I’ve been working on another film the last seven months; we’ve shot a couple locations. We were up in Maine back in November, building boards with the guys from Grain, the LaVecchiabrothers, and hanging out up there. And I did another trip to the Bahamas recently. Kind of a far out-there island that’s really difficult to get to.\n\nHave you been getting waves?\n\nWe got Maine pretty dang good for a log, and the Bahamas were really fun – it was a very, very interesting trip. We ran out of food, we ran out of water and our boards got stuck on the island for 45 days. But we came back with what we needed.\n\nDetails? Are there a couple customs guys with a new quiver or what?\n\nNo, the only way to get to this island is by private charter flight. And they changed the flight on us the morning of the flight. They sent a different plane, and the plane they sent wouldn’t fit our boards and they were kind of taken hostage by the guy who owned the marina. To make a long story short, I had to fly over to Nassau a few weeks ago and had to pick them up off a government mail boat and then bring them back through customs and ship them out of Florida back to Kassia Meador and Scotty Stopnik and I took my boards back home. It was great, makes good stories.\n\nDo you have a name for the movie yet, or is that on the hush-hush?\n\nI would love to make up some sort of bullshit story on how I want to keep quiet on what it is, but really I just can’t think of a name. I’ve been forcing it so hard, I’ve been flipping through the dictionary. Picaresque just fell into lap; it was the easiest thing ever. That’s probably why I’m having such a hard time, because it was such a good name and it came so easy. Where as this one, I can’t think of anything.\n\nWhen are you trying to have it done by?\n\nI would like to have it out in stores before Christmas, but you say that, and it will probably be out the next summer. Just how it goes. Whether you’re waiting on music to clear or any of the million other things that can go wrong when you’re making a film. We’re off to a good start though.\n\nThrough the movies and surfing, you’ve done quite a lot of traveling, what destinations stand out and why?\n\nI always say this, but I love the northeast in fall more than any other place in the world. It’s got so much going for it: there’s so much swell in the water, it’s so uncrowded because Labor Day has passed and people go back to work and summer houses are done. You get a lot of quality surf by yourself and the weather is amazing. You still get those days where it’s 70 degrees and the wind blows offshore, I rave so much about the northeast.\n\nCan you still find secret spots up there?\n\nI surf New York by myself all the time, especially that time of year. You’re still in 3/2s, and you’re not wearing booties and it’s not cold yet. It’s the best. There are other places that obviously have better surf that time of year. France is one of them, which is one of the most gorgeous places in the world.\n\nSo are you done with the contest thing altogether?\n\nI still do a couple contests on the East Coast, mostly because I can ride a log in them and I don’t have to ride three-fin longboards and do kick flips and stuff. I could never stick those [laughs].\n\nSo what role does surfing play?\n\nRight now I just love to travel and ride a bunch of different things, and go on different trips to new places, and make little films about it and stuff like that. More what people were doing before the contest scene came into play. Just cool trips to unique places. Even not unique places, but making normal places unique somehow.\n\nIs that where you see the longboarding thing going?\n\nYeah, I think so. Just the whole way longboarding is going, I wouldn’t even pigeon-hole it as longboarding, I would call it more just surfing, because I definitely don’t have more than one or two longboards in my bag when I travel. Usually I have more shortboards and oddly shaped things, whether they are Stubby’s or some sort of single-fin or a rounder-style shortboard or something like that. Always going on trips bringing all sorts of different things. I think that’s where it’s going.\n\nThat takes me to my next question: what’s currently in your quiver?\n\nChris Christenson is making the majority of my boards. I’ve got a 9’9” pintail log, which is unreal in glassy type waves. I’ve been really addicted to this 6’2”, I guess it’s like a Hull outline, without a Hull bottom, and with a far forward single fin. He calls it a Stubby. It works insane when the surf is kind of lined up and it’s super fun when it barrels. I’ve got one of Jon Wegener’s peanut alaias, a 5’8”, which always comes with me everywhere. And then I’ve got a 5’4” roundtail quad that I always bring with me. That’s kind of my go-to set-up. You can ride anything on those four boards. There’s no way you can ever not have fun on one of those boards in whatever conditions are thrown at you.\n\nWhat excites you about surfing right now? What’s going right in surfing?\n\nA lot of people are riding everything. There are so many people that shred on so many different things, like Harrison Roach surfs amazing on anything, Chris Del Moro surfs absolutely anything that’s handed to him and surfs better than most people that specialize in just one thing, whether it’s a longboard or a shortboard. I think that kind of stuff is cool, that’s what excites me. Not seeing people ride one board in every type of wave. I don’t know, I would get really bored. I don’t know how I used to do that. I spent a lot of time trying to figure that out.\n\nWhat’s wrong with surfing or the industry right now?\n\nI just don’t think there’s enough money in it. I don’t think there’s anything, per se, wrong, maybe everyone’s shorts are too long [laughs], but I wouldn’t say that anything is really wrong with it. Maybe marketing money is being spent in some of the wrong places some of the time, but I think a lot of the companies have the right idea of what’s going on and a lot of companies are backing some alternative style stuff and that whole deal.\n\nNow some general personal questions: what are you listening to these days?\n\nThe lead singer from The Shins just came out with a new project called Broken Bell, that just came out a few days ago and it’s unbelievable. There’s a band from Florida, they are from Palm Beach, and they’re called Surfer Blood. None of them surf and they’re super young, but they play amazing music. They’re like Modern Day Pavement, kind of. That’s kind of weird for a band like that to come out of a cultureless south Florida town.\n\nWhat are you reading?\n\nActually, I just finished reading “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” a couple of weeks ago. It’s written by the editor-in-chief of French Elle and it’s about when he had a stroke and it left him with a condition called locked-in syndrome. He basically wrote an entire book by dictating his entire story to a nurse by blinking. She would recite the most frequently used letters and he would blink when she got to the proper letter. Amazing. Really, really crazy.\n\nWhat else is going on in your life that we should know about?\n\nJust making that film , traveling a whole bunch, I just signed another two-year contract with Hurley, which is pretty awesome. Those guys are very supportive of everything that I do.\n\nLast thing: what’s next?\n\nI’ve go about four more trips to do on the movie, so that’s really going to occupy the rest of my summer. Hopefully be full-on editing by August. I’ve been learning Final Cut a lot more and I’ve been laying out this whole project myself. SO it’s been very, very time consuming logging and capturing. The last one I didn’t really do any of that on my own.\n\nFind out more about Mikey DeTemple and the film Picaresque here.\n\nRon Croci is a talented California surfer/artist who creates colorful and fluid paintings which express the surfing lifestyle. A surfer for over 49 years, Ron shares with us his life of creating art.\n\nWhat was your life like growing up?\n\nAlthough I was born in Chicago of Italian parents, we moved to Half Moon Bay in San Mateo when I was 12. It was a wonderful time for young kids to grow up; this was a time before stoplights, before hippies, before drugs and before commercial development and the restraints that are commonplace now. At that time, there was only the breeze across the dunes and empty beaches. Near the town of Half Moon Bay, there were mostly farmers and beatniks. On the weekends and in summer, we would leave home in the morning and return in the evening with no worries on the part of our parents.\n\nThen, we discovered surfing. Basically, we were among the first surfers. We were the first to watch Mavericks. From the farmlands on the cliffs, we kids would stare in amazement at the huge green peaks that would glisten white against the blue sky as the offshore wind cascaded from the wave tops. With our beaver-tailed wetsuits and balsa/foam boards, we as kids pioneered almost all of the now popular breaks. Then, there was open farmland to the many beaches. We were like Tom Sawyers with surfboards.\n\nWhen did you get your first surfboard?\n\nAll of my surfboards growing up were junk and I can’t really remember how I got my first board. There were no shops except for O’Neill’s in Santa Cruz and old boards drifted from hand to hand. We were not like modern kids with beautiful new shortboards; everyone’s board was at least nine feet long and really heavy. To walk from the Coast Highway to Ano Nuevo took 45 minutes with two guys carrying two boards—nose and tails. My parents were poor Italian immigrants, so we could not afford such a luxury as a surfboard. They would say, “What is a surfboard anyway?”\n\nWhat was the feeling you had when you first stood on a surfboard?\n\nMy first stand up ride was at Cowell’s Beach in Santa Cruz—long and slow, but I felt like the god Mercury, traveling from one celestial realm to another.\n\nWho did you look up to when you were a young man?\n\nI was inspired by the likes of Salvador Dali, Phil Edwards, Ben Cartwright, John Coltrane, Art Blakey, my father and uncle plus many more. However, as a kid I was so egocentric that there was hardly any room for anyone but me.\n\nHow did you get involved in art?\n\nWhen I was 15 years old, two interesting things happened at the same time. First, I watched beatniks on the Peter Gunn detective show. They played cool jazz and painted abstract art, which I thought was so absorbing. I was completely enthralled by “the scene.” Then, at the same time, I was walking down a library aisle in the art section, which was odd at the time since I knew nothing about the subject, when I saw a book protruding out from the shelf. It was a book about Salvador Dali. On the cover was his famous painting “The Persistence of Memory”. As soon as I saw the image, my consciousness screamed out, “That’s what I want to do!” The rest is history.\n\nWhat is your process for creating your art?\n\nInspiration, contemplation, then to thumbnail sketches, to enlarged drawings, color comps and finished art. My overriding concern is always how to make it beautiful. I strive for completion, not correction. (For my process, see Club of the Waves: http://www.clubofthewaves.com/art_interview_ron_croci.php)\n\nOf all the places you traveled to, what stands out?\n\nThat’s easy—the Kaiser Bowl in Waikiki. I have surfed that strip from Three’s to Ala Moana over 2000 times. I have seen there … perfection, degradation, sunshine, camaraderie, addictions, sadness and death.\n\nWhat inspires you?\n\nI am inspired by the greats in any field whether it is art, science or motherhood. All forms of creativity inspire me—from the beggar with his sign to the Sistine Chapel.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you learned in your life?\n\nBe attentive and careful of what you do as it will always come back to reward or punish you.\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nThere are at least 50 things that I have done that I regret terribly and I have paid the price for my misdeeds. Here is a short list: people I have taken unfair advantage of, raising my voice in anger, stuff I swiped as a kid, thinking my opinion is the only way of looking at things, not putting love before ego and trying to be controlling.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nAll the typical things one can be proud of (such as family, love, achievements of all sorts). However, from a professional perspective, it was my role and accomplishment in the development and design of the Hawaiian Maritime Museum. In my role as lead designer, I developed most of the maritime exhibits depicting the past, present and future of Hawaii and her link to the sea. Thousands of Hawaiian children have visited this wonderful museum and have gained insights to their heritage.\n\nWhat meaning does surfing hold for you and how has it changed your life?\n\nIt means a lot—the sea is my mistress. However, it has really not really changed me since I caught my first wave in 1960. Before that I was a man; after that I was a surfer. I have surfed and participated in water sports basically for 49 years—most of my life. These sports have kept me sane for most of these years.\n\nWho are some of the people that are shaping the surfing path today?\n\nAnybody who has read a surf magazine or seen a video is very aware of the current leaders in innovation, so I don’t need to go into it. However, a lesser-known aspect of shaping the “path” applies to the path of surfing art, which is what we are talking about here. I think Wade is really leading the way. His recent seascapes are dark and brooding with a mixture of dread and beauty. His work reminds me of background art for 1950’s Tarzan book covers. On the other hand, Drew is a super surrealist whose work is appealing to kids and adults alike. Drew has opened the surf art door to artists and admirers alike.\n\nWhat is your favorite surfboard? What are favorite surf spots?\n\nMy favorite board that I have owned is a nine foot Sparky from Honolulu. But, come on … we are talking 49 years of surfing and I can’t remember all the boards I have ever had.\n\nMy three favorite surf spots are: Palos Verdes’ Cove in California, Kaiser Bowl in Hawaii and Sanur Reef in Bali.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal?\n\nI have two kinds of favorite meals. First is my mom’s homemade raviolis. My mom and dad would spend an entire afternoon making raviolis for the holidays. The second is lobsters or Calico Bass that I catch myself. I simmer the creatures in lots of butter and garlic. Then, a Manoa lettuce salad with ciabatta bread and homemade cheese, sweetened with sugar and dried fruit.\n\nWhat is on your ipod?\n\nI don’t own an ipod, however if you are asking what kind of music I enjoy listening to: Stravinsky, Ravel, Debussy, Chopin, Coltrane, Armstrong, Blakey, Getz, Allman Brothers, Dylan, Cobain, Eminem, 50 Cent, Afro-Cuban, Balinese, Bosa Nova, Tibetan chanting, Spike Jones. The list goes on. I love all kinds of music—no matter when or where composed.\n\nWhat causes or organizations do you support?\n\nI promote and I am a member of Pangaea Seed, which is a marine activist group from Japan which is attempting to curb the use of shark as a food source. I try to help the many good causes that I am asked to donate to.\n\nWhat are your grateful for?\n\nI am grateful that I still have the opportunity improve myself spiritually, artistically, personally, morally and mentally. I still have my health, and that means everything.\n\nWhat’s next Ron Croci?\n\nI just finished the Indonesian Surfing Competition artwork, which is sponsored by Coca Cola. This art was created for t-shirts and prints. I have also designed several new t-shirt designs for the summer season. I am creating four new seascapes that are going into print as limited edition giclees.\n\nI am also painting thirty-two 12 x 12 inch water color illustrations for the book titled Lil G. Lil G is an inspirational book for young children teaching them about gratitude. It will be my 12th book. I am having artwork in the new SIMA calendar. And am part of an exhibit titled “Art in Motion” in Redondo Beach. I also have to continuously supply artwork to my galleries (McKibben Studios, Beach Street Gallery, Montanero Gallery and Kohala Coast Fine Arts). I will be spending time this year also helping to promote the book Surf Story.\n\nRon Croci’s website can be found here. Find out more about the Surf Story Project here.\n\nJean Pierre Van Swae is a California surfer/shaper who goes by the name of “Fly.” A popular surfboard shaper for over 40 years, he started his board building career making fins for Fred Wardy. Fly explains why it’s so important to “keep the stoke” and to spread aloha in our daily lives.\n\nWhat was it like growing up?\n\nI was born in Europe and I came to the United States when I was five years old. Raised in California, we lived inland in places like West Covina and Monterey Park. It was alright, we would slide down hills on boxes for entertainment. That part of my life was mediocre but still fun.\n\nIt wasn’t until ’58 when we moved to Laguna Beach that I saw guys riding waves. It was like a door opened up. It was like “Wow!” We’ve got the ocean, guys riding surfboards – it was something all new to me. The whole experience just tickled the hell out of me. Surfing was love at first sight.\n\nDo you remember the first time you stood up on a board and the feeling you had?\n\nYes. It was at Doheny in 1959, on a balsa wood board from Hobie that I paid 60 bucks for. There was nobody out in the water and it was a small day. It was frustrating at first because I would pearl or I would miss the wave. And this went on numerous times because the board had very little rocker – it was almost like a tabletop! I finally caught a wave and it was such an exhilarating feeling when I did stand up, it felt like I was literally on top of the world. There are two things in life you will never forget – your first wave and your first gal.\n\nTell us about your first job\n\nI hung around Fred Wardy’s shop so much they finally put me to work. I started learning about things like fins, fiberglass, resin, and foam. I really learned how to make a board from start to finish. It was a job that wasn’t really a job. It was a bunch of guys that worked together and we had a blast. We would all go surf Trestles and come back and then do our work, have dinner, a few beers, and get ready for the next day. There was a lot of camaraderie and we knew what to do.\n\nWho did you look up to at that time?\n\nPeople like Dale Velzy. Wardy. Phil Edwards. Mickey Munoz. All local people who were veterans. Seeing people like Joey Cabell, how smooth he was. Watching guys who really knew positioning, and knew how to judge waves – and to just be smooth about it.\n\nHow important is style?\n\nYou can watch people out in the water and everyone has their own style. Without even seeing their face out there in the water, you can tell who it is. Surfing is like a dance and you don’t want to be awkward. If you’ve got style you can actually use that in your favor to get into and out of situations. Besides just looking good, you can throw your arms out and can gain a little speed. Style is functional.\n\nWhat do you love about surfing?\n\nThat each day is a different day. With waves, you don’t really know what Mother Nature’s gonna throw at you. Everybody has a different feel for it. Some people use it as a form of meditation. Those that have frustrating jobs and they need to vent it out. For myself, I enjoy what I do – making boards, so for me it is a gift. Basically each wave that I get is a gift that I enjoy.\n\nEach wave that you catch is a treat. A gift of nature. It’s being in harmony with the whole environment – the ocean, the swell. It’s you and the ocean melting together. With a certain amount of dedication, it’s kind of like a reward. I’m happy if I can stand up and hoot and holler!\n\nWhat is your process for making boards?\n\nI try to find out how long they’ve been surfing, what they surf and where they surf. I get a feel for where they are in their surfing. Everybody has a different way they want to have fun.\n\nWhat’s your favorite part of shaping?\n\nIt’s the whole process. It’s like a sculpture that you are doing for someone. When I get a blank, it’s like a raw canvas. Shaping is done in segments starting with the plan shape, the rails, contours of the nose and tails. All of these things add up and then a picture unfolds. It’s like doing a painting.\n\nHow long have you been shaping?\n\nI’ve been on my own since 1970, shaping my own boards and glassing them. My old shop was in a barn so I did everything – from shaping to glassing. I even made my own fins. I always look at something and think: “How can I make it better?”\n\nOf all the places you’ve traveled to, what place in particular stands out and why?\n\nI spent some time in Tahiti which was fun. I didn’t get to surf a lot of the neat spots over there but I did get to surf some real enjoyable places. But I have to admit, being in Kauai was one of the best times I’ve ever had. Friends that I knew and friends that I met – along with the sheer quality of waves. There were places that were really good – like left break waves. Pakala’s is a great wave. You can longboard or shortboard and even get barreled there.\n\nWho/What inspires you?\n\nThere are people like Mickey Munoz – he’s kept the stoke. People who are still surfing that are still pumped up. Also Fred Wardy, Del Cannon, Terry Martin – these guys have taught me a lot. Not only are they my friends but they’ve been willing to pass on to me what they’ve learned.\n\nLife inspires me. It’s really a leaning process. Everyday I go out I try to learn a little bit and maybe help someone out. I try to keep the aloha spirit out there.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nI’m proud of all of my kids. They’ve done so well. My youngest Jean Paul is an excellent photographer and he’s got the best job. I’ve got a wonderful granddaughter. I’ve taken all of my kids out in the water at the age of one so that they can share the stoke and grow to love surfing like I have.\n\nOh, and my ’55 Chevy station wagon named Peggy Sue that I have been busy restoring…\n\nWho do you feel are some of the people shaping the path for surfing today?\n\nThere are so many good shapers today. Timmy Patterson I’ve known since he was a little tiny kid. I would have never guessed that he would be such a great board builder. He grew up to be an excellent shaper and has even taught me a few new tricks! His Dad would have been very proud of him if he were still alive.\n\nWhat’s your favorite board you are riding these days?\n\nRight now it’s a big board. It’s 10’7″, 27 inches wide, 4 inches thick that was made for a customer who didn’t want it because a pinline was left off of it! At San Onofre, it is such an easy riding board that can catch anything that you can see. It’s just downright fun! I call the board “Eddie.”\n\nWhat’s you favorite surf spot?\n\nIt would have to Lowers even though I haven’t surfed it in a while. It’s a good wave and it’s so much fun. I’ve had numerous good times surfing there, uncrowded – back when the Marines used to chase you off the beach. Now it’s open to the public and it’s like Malibu. I like to keep the fun in surfing. And surfing with 60 guys is just a little too much. I have more fun surfing at San Onofre with a bunch of good friends. It’s the fun factor. I always ask “How’s the fun meter – is it cranked up yet?”\n\nWhat kind of music do you listen to?\n\nElvis. Bob Dylan. Led Zeppelin, Crosby, Stills, & Nash, Cream. Older guys, sure but there is some really good stuff in there. Blues like B.B. King – Jazz like Dave Brubeck and Take Five. If it’s soulful and has a great beat – even AC/DC!\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nComing to California and making it to the beach! And for my Mom getting job and making it to Laguna Beach. I am so damn grateful.\n\nWhat’s next for Mr. Van Swae?\n\nI’ve gotten numerous requests for stand up boards. This is new territory for me as a shaper. Some people don’t like it and that it’s going to the “dark side.” People are really having a good time with them and it’s good exercise.\n\nBasically I want to refine my business and make it as good as I can. And I simply enjoy the fact that I am on the beach making surfboards.\n\nFind out more about Pierre “Fly” Van Swae and his surfboards here. Photographs of Fly surfing by JPVan Swae. All other images by Glenn Sakamoto.\n\nDaniel Costa is a surfer/shaper/photographer from Portugal who is the creator of the popular blog Retro Movement. Interested in keeping traditional board riding alive, Daniel documents the surfing lifestyle through images, texts, and board building. We caught up with Daniel to learn more.\n\nWhat was life like growing up in Portugal?\n\nIt was okay, but when I was young Portugal had just come up from a civil revolution that for ages closed the country to the world. I guess that kept us a bit behind the rest. When I was around 16, things started to change. I was lucky in some ways because I grew up on a farm instead of a city, so I had a pretty good childhood—always liked to be outside doing my things. I was stoked on learning and would do anything like build my own toys or do some agriculture to get some money cause my family was just a simple countryside one. I always felt that something could be better than that. For some reason, I think I always knew that I was different from all my friends where I grew up.\n\nWho did you look up to and admire when you were young?\n\nI don’t think there was anyone who I admired, to be honest, until I found surfing at age 15. I was on holidays, and saw Surfing magazine for the first time covering an interview with Darrick Doerner, with really impressive images in black and white of Waimea. And that was it. That was the changing point to me. Then, I would say my heroes were guys like Tom Curren, Gerry Lopez and Tom Carroll with his famous snap in the curl of Pipe. Now, the ones I most like to watch gliding is Skip Frye, Terry Fitzgerald and Derek Hynd.\n\nWhat was the feeling you had when you first stood on a surfboard?\n\nI remember I felt something like I never had felt. I still remember arriving at the beach to learn surfing. It was wintertime and I didn’t have a wetsuit. I’d been working all summer, but it was only enough to buy the board; the wetsuit had to wait another summer, but it didn’t matter. I never felt the cold; I was completely stoked. For the first time, I was feeling really alive. It was like I had just been awakened from a long, long sleep. I still remember like if it was today.\n\nWhere did you interest in art and design come from?\n\nWith shaping, I was pushed by my best friend. His words to me were, “Hey, man, you are really good working with your hands. You really have to try shaping a board.” At that time, we were together all the time because we were running a surf club in the town we lived, so he really pushed me into it. The photography? It’s an old passion that I have never had a chance to go forward with because of the money issue. Then, when the digital was cheap enough, I bought my first Nikon and it has been my escape ever since. Now, I have a couple of old Nikons and I really love to shoot film.\n\nNow, with the stupid crowds in the lineups, most of the time I just go away inland to stay alone, away from all the crap surf scene that is out there nowadays. I just stay cool, looking for something to shoot. Now I only like to surf when there’s no one out. I don’t have the passion to be in the water with a bunch of jerks.\n\nTell us about Retro Movement.\n\nIt’s was supposed to be a project around my surfboards, mostly about lifestyle—the lifestyle we had the first years I started surfing back in the 90’s, when surfers were a different kind of people from the man in the streets. I still have in mind a couple of ideas (like starting some clothing using my photography).\n\nI have another thing starting to happen next autumn. “The Retro Experience” basically brings together people that want to surf relaxed on cool waves without the crap around. We’ll give them the opportunity of riding all kinds of different boards—all real surfboards built by me and not those plastics things. We will have longboards, classic noseriders, twins, singles, quads, etc.\n\nI still have a couple more things I would like to do. I especially want to try to give back something to the sport that made me what I am today.\n\nOf all the places you have traveled to, what place in particular stands out? And why?\n\nThe East Coast of Australia. It’s a wonderful place to spend a couple of months. There are incredible places with long pointbreaks away from the crowds—just perfect for longboarding. The people are great and their relaxed lifestyle is really a good vibe to feel and share. Also, I’ve made great friends there and met one of the kindest men on earth—Alan Crosky. He gave us shelter for two months on his place, and shared with me plenty of stories and knowledge.\n\nWho or what inspires you?\n\nIn the shaping, I need to have the feeling. For example, let’s say I have a nice noserider on order. I will not start shaping till I feel like it. Normally, it comes after a good session in the water. When waiting for the waves, I’m thinking on the last wave and the board I’m using, and it’s gonna start developing in my head the idea of the next board. If I view in my brain the board I want, then I leave the water and go straight to the shaping bay. This is how I like to do it. Sometimes my customers have to be patient, but I’m lucky; they already know how I work and they are quite happy with this idea because 90% of my customers know really well what they want. They don’t want a crappy board made in China.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you have learned in your life?\n\nThat life isn’t about acquiring wealth and a big house with the garage full of Ferraris and Mercedes. Life is about joy and sharing with the ones you love. It’s about simple things—like riding a wave with your mates, putting your child to sleep and feeling the unconditional love from her, meeting a nice human being …so rare these days now. I am lucky and found great friends all over the place. That what counts and that’s what I’m trying to teach my daughter.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nSearching for my goals. Everybody said that I was crazy giving up the best engineering degree to work on boats to watch the ocean and get money to go away and see the world. The first year people from Portugal were able to visit Indonesia, I straight away get the flight. Then, I went to Australia to live there for six months and came back with the certainty I would never work from 9 to 5 again. In a week back at my parents, I was done. I bought a caravan, asked the guy to drive to a camping area on the southwest coast of Portugal and, for the next seven years, that was my home. I was on top of the world, had achieved what I thought was impossible.\n\nWhat meaning does surfing hold for you and how has it changed your life?\n\nWhen I saw those images of Darrick Doerner at Waimea, I thought to myself that it could change my life. So, I started to search for more information about the surfing world. I found what I was looking for: a goal, friendship, complicity among members of a totally different tribe from the man on the street.\n\nFrom an “A” student with the normal goal to achieve wealth, I changed to a simple guy just trying to surf as much as I can and totally absorbed by the surfing culture. Eventually I quit college. My parents freaked out. I started to be seen as the black sheep of the family, but didn’t care.\n\nNowadays, I can live and be happy with what I get instead of searching for a bigger house and a better car than my neighbor. I fulfilled most of my dreams and have had my work recognized by people who know what they are saying. Next May I will be exhibiting my photos in Japan at the Greenroom Festival. I’m stoked and comfortable with what I’ve got.\n\nWhat brings you the most happiness in the world?\n\nEvery day, I wake up my daughter to take her to school and she’s always happy like if it was the best day of her life. That’s the ultimate happiness. No matter how long the tube rides or hang tens you’ll do, nothing compares to the smile of my daughter Zoe.\n\nWho are some of the people you feel are shaping the path for surfing today?\n\nThere’s a lot of new guys out there. But, to be honest, I still believe that “the masters” are still the masters. To me, Donald Takayama and Skip Frye are the best ever.\n\nWhat is your favorite board? Your favorite surf spot?\n\nHmmmm, it’s difficult to say just one. Nowadays, anything that noserides well and I’m stoked. I also would say my first pig; I drew the template on my board bag from what Alex Knost was riding in the Salinas Longboard Festival. It’s based on the Velzy Pig and I just loved it.\n\nMy favorite surf spot would have to be the place I used to live in my caravan. I got there the best waves, and the biggest too, of my life with no one or just with friends.\n\nWhat’s your favorite meal?\n\nSeafood with friends and family—that’s the best. I have some friends that are fisherman, so sometimes the great meals are at my place.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to on your iPod?\n\nI’m always changing, but some things are always there: Ben Harper, Pearl Jam, AC/DC, TSOL and the Litmus soundtrack.\n\nWhat causes, projects, organizations do you support?\n\nRight now, I’m a bit disappointed with organizations in general. I think they are run for the wrong reasons. On top of that, I have so many things going on in my life that I have no space to support anything.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nI’m grateful for finding surfing back in the 90’s. I could feel and try the lifestyle, the culture, the stoke of meeting another surfer, surfing another wave. People who learn to surf today don’t have a clue what surf is. Also, I’m grateful for my friends I have that I known I can count on no matter what. I’m also grateful for my skills; I’m the worst salesman, but, on the other hand, I’m able to build whatever I want to.\n\nWhat’s next for Dan Costa?\n\nGood question. I ask the same question to myself over and over again. I want to take even further my surfboards. I’ve accomplished so much more than I was expecting, but now I know that it can be better. I want to take forward the Retro Movement project, my photography and, most important, be 200% present in my daughter’s life, giving her the tools to be a great human being. Pay my mortgage… that’s important too. If possible, next year I would like to go to California, but I would need a great summer!!!!\n\nFind out more about Daniel Costa and Retro Movement here.\n\nMiles Thompson is a talented California surfer/artist whose paintings are a mixture of pop culture, island tiki, and surrealism. His work is like an endless stream of consciousness that flows from his mind to his brush. We spoke with Miles to find out what makes him tick.\n\nWhat was life like growing up?\n\nIn ’71, I was born on a Navy base in Pensacola, Florida. Four months later, we moved to El Toro at the end of Laguna Canyon Road. I spent time at the beaches in San Clemente, Dana Point, and Laguna.\n\nHuge lines of beefcake belly rash that lasted all summer from my first generation Morey Boogie at T Street and skimming at Strands morning, noon and twilight. I was a lucky, bespectacled and blistered kid for my first 14 summers.\n\nI liked sponges so much I bused to Salt Creek daily in 8th grade to get tubes on my used Mach 7 and loved the graffiti under the bridge there—marveling at aerosol painted waves before the Ritz was even an idea: Anarchy! Locals Only! No Fat Chicks! Kooks Go Home! I spent a year and half in Australia and spent months on the Gold Coast, along the reef in between 8th and 9th grade. Sydney was amazing. Later, I graduated high school in Encinitas while living in funky Leucadia, surfing Beacons daily.\n\nWho did you look up to and admire when you were a young man?\n\nI looked up to the Bionic Man more than anyone for long time. I stuck tight with my boogie boarding, BMX big brother, gathering the vocab necessary to trash talk him. I learned to refine my drafting skills by watching the pencil of my stepfather, who was, and is, an architect. Around the time of high school, I really admired my dad’s wild nature. He took me out on Hobies, Sabots, weekend Catalina jumps galore and jaunt or two on an 8m Cup Runner or two.\n\nWhen did you get your first surfboard?\n\nMy first board was a 5’10” channel bottom double fly swallow tail thruster that I got about a month after I started surfing. That was a Tubeline and I loved it like chips. I was 14.\n\nWhat was the feeling you had when you first stood on a surfboard?\n\nA drifty, falling downstream weightlessness was my first real sensation as I surveyed the water below my feet moving all around over orange sandy eddies. I had dropped into plenty of waves, but this was a whole new perspective on wavecraft—laughingly similar to an elevator’s cord being cut.\n\nWhere did you interest in art come from?\n\nI just liked the way certain things looked that had a sense of personality, style and individual quality. I always loved good newspaper comics with systematic black spotting, whether or not they were inked with a brush or a pen. When a pen or brush touches paper, it can carry a lot of impact. Rick Griffin, printed in stacks of Surfer mags in every garage of my neighborhood growing up, was God. He can’t be topped … ever. (Sorry Robert.) For cartooning, there was only Mad, ZAP, Playboy and EC … the best.\n\nWhat is your process when creating your art?\n\nMy stuff is now more about the research than it is about the craft and technique. The approach does vary depending on what I want out of the process, and it is always subject to change. Currently, I’m finishing a portrait of Dora this week that I started months ago.\n\nWith gouache painting, I try to honor the thumbnail sketch, but it often evolves as I sit with it and sometimes an idea becomes disproportionately ambitious. I love what I do, so I do it as best I can.\n\nOf all the places you have traveled to, what place in particular stands out? And why?\n\nMy brightest oceanic moment lies in a single night between the Pacific islands of Hawaii and the real west, about half way out, on a dead calm sea, fertile with phosphorescent microjellies spreading giant gently slow rolling pointed V’s off the bow wake below the pulpit on a mirror that seemed to end at about 50 feet off. I was calmly, cosmically and stone cold soberly buffeted by the cotton candy of the milky way from horizon to horizon. Green/white waterbound lights, accompanied by corporate satellites overhead and perfect water all around, fused into what seemed was an island. It was peace.\n\nWho or what inspires you?\n\nMy 7 year old daughter. Those that are self-possessed, without being self-righteous about facts, who elect to manifest their own honorable version of their history—history inspires! Venus, a girlfriend, music, art, food, sex, tiny nerds with big ideas, cameras and writing.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you have learned in your life?\n\nThat you go now. Patience. And that familiarity breeds contempt.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nMy daughter. I’m constantly asking the universe, “She’s really mine?”\n\nWho are some of the people you feel are shaping the path for surfing today?\n\nNobody is. The waves are shaping the future path of waveriding, not surfers or shapers. Nobody is leading surfing anywhere it hasn’t been already. The ancient surfers went straight so that they could share waves as communion.\n\nWhat is currently your favorite board? Your favorite surf spot?\n\nBy far my favorite board is a 6’6″ Klaus Jones stringerless “Arc board,” inspired by Esteban Bojorquez’s surfboards like all of Klaus’ hulls. Klaus made this board for himself. Now, it’s mine. I also love my 9′ CC Slider when it’s flat or lulled out—such a fun one\n\nRincon is my favorite spot because of the community; it’s less of a hassle than surfing L.A. County.\n\nWhat’s your favorite meal?\n\nAhi Tuna Ponchartrain at The Palace Grill in Santa Barbara. I just had some serious pumpkin, red pepper and cashew action—that’s pretty good. Sweet potatoes and thyme, ginger, breads, nuts, beans, salad and cheese. I still eat animals, but am doing it less and less in an effort to curb carbon impact.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to on your iPod?\n\nI’ve bought and sold music since junior high. I like heritage jazz a lot. I like everything but punk from Orange County in the ‘70s. I’m not impervious to the whimsy of a Moog, a Thermin or the human voice.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nMy ex-wife—her life after a year of cancer treatment, her love as a friend. We were 13 years together, so she’s family and I just love that she’s alive. I’m immune to all shit thanks to entirely to this one natural miracle.\n\nWhat’s next for Miles Thompson?\n\nPromoting Ocean awareness and Global Fishery Management.\n\nIn July, I’m taking on a one man show in Leucadia with an old friend. Planning an art board or two—maybe do some limited edition fins— with portraits of surf history, such as the Duke, Da Cat, Da Bull, Greenough, Liddle, etc.\n\nI’m curating a Tiki Ti 50th Anniversary event in 2011 and publishing a volume of that show as well as producing my own inaugural ceramic set with Munktiki for that event.\n\nI really want to continue my series of California portraits, and am planning a show a year and a half out with Jim McMillan on another portrait show.\n\nAll images courtesy Miles Thompson. All rights reserved.\n\nMatt Calvani is a California surfer/shaper who heads up the Bing brand of surfboards. Matt continues the tradition of the South Bay surfboard building legacy while adding his own modern touch. We asked Matt to share with us his life of shaping.\n\nWhat was life like growing up?\n\nI grew up in rural Massachusetts near the ocean. My mom was a housewife and my dad had a business restoring old antique lighting—a self-taught craftsman. My parents got divorced when I was eight. I lived with my mom. She was truly remarkable and went back to school at 37. She got a B.A. in interior design. Then, it was off to California in 1984. I was in the middle of eighth grade and we lived two blocks from the ocean in Hermosa Beach. I was stoked because I always loved the ocean and got into surfing right away.\n\nTell us how you got started shaping\n\nI became a typical surf shop gremmie and got to know a local shaper by the name of Tom Stanton. I started hanging out at his shaping room on 26th Street and became totally fascinated with the craft. I think he got sick of all my questions and finally gave me job helping him airbrush surfboards.\n\nThey became my second family. Tom was a perfectionist and a master craftsman who gave me a solid foundation to go out on my own. Like most fledgling shapers, I started in my garage shaping for local South Bay surfers. After getting a couple hundred boards under my belt, I rented a small unit next door to three of the main historical South Bay factories of the 60’s—Bing, Greg Noll and Rick. Some of the legends were still around shaping surfboards (like Hap Jacobs, Phil Becker and Lance Carson).\n\nThis was when I learned the old school art of shaping and longboard design. Meanwhile, a revolution in design was going on with the shortboards. Boards went from bulky flat rockers to extreme rockers, foils and ultra narrow outlines. Al Merrick was leading the revolution and Shoreline Glassing, in Hermosa Beach, was glassing them. I was airbrushing a lot of the Channel Islands back then. It was an exciting time, and I took complete advantage of the entire goings on. Dennis Jarvis of Spyder surfboards was tapping into Merrick’s designs and had a superstar surf team. I ended up with a job “rough-shaping” for Spyder and part-time for Hap Jacobs. This was also when the first crude shapes were coming off the KKL shaping machine and I mean crude.\n\nMerrick was one of the first to jump on the technology and Dennis was always right behind. With the machine coming into the picture and the need for “rough shaping” not as prominent, I decided to go with a job offer at Becker Surfboards. This job was a trial of nerves. Phil Becker told me I had to work up to 11 shaped boards a day by hand or they would hire another shaper and I would lose half my income. I made the plunge but… man… that was the hardest year of my whole career. After seven years of that—I was done.\n\nTell us why you chose the Bing brand as your business.\n\nI was already shaping single fin designs for Rick Surfboards with my friend Jeff Stoner and for Lance Carson when I ran into Bing in Baja Mexico on a random surf trip with some buddies. I told him I was building Ricks and owed him some royalty money for a few Bing & Rick boards Jeff and I had built. Then, I offered to shape his boards if he ever needed anyone to do it. As luck would have it, his good friend and one of his original shapers, Mike Eaton, who was the current licensee for Bing Surfboards, happily relinquished the name since he was quickly approaching retirement himself. This couldn’t have happened at a better time for me. With Channel Islands and several other companies dominating the shortboard niche, I quickly realized that if I continued down the path I was on, I would struggle for a long time to carve out a place for myself in this competitive market. Bing gave me just the opportunity that I needed to move forward in my career as a shaper.\n\nI always knew that I wanted to take Bing Surfboards in the direction of “a core high-end brand”. The Bing brand has always had a mystique about it—from its association with David Nuuhiwa and Dick Brewer to the Campbell Brothers bonzers—that has made it a part of surfing history. I started introducing and refining those amazing historical shapes. My goal was to capture the essence of those eras in surfboard history while adding the knowledge I had learned in my own journey.\n\nHow come there isn’t a Matt Calvani brand?\n\nI strongly believe in a “brand,” a company that goes far beyond its original founders. I don’t want this company to be about me. It’s more about carrying on the Bing legacy, setting my ego aside and focusing on building the brand to the extent that I don’t even sign the boards. In the 60’s, Bing employed a lot of talented shapers, but in the end it was the brand that stood the test of time. Take the Ford Mustang, for example. Not too many people know who designed that car, but people know that it was a quality product because of the Ford brand name.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nPioneer shapers Matt Kivlin, Joe Quigg and Bob Simmons, who inspired Dale Velzy and Hap Jacobs in the balsa era. That led to the first surf shops and surf brands like Bing, Rick and Jacobs. This, in turn, made way for the shapers I worked with, like Dan Bendicksen, Dennis Jarvis and Phil Becker. They all, directly or indirectly, inspired me or taught me what I know today.\n\nDo you shape your boards by hand or do you use a machine?\n\nI guess the easiest answer is BOTH. I started shaping boards before the machine was really even relevant, grinding my way through shape after shape at Becker. When the computer came along, I began to see its value as a tool just like my Skil or Rockwell. When I opened my own surfboard shaping and glass factory, the machine really became crucial to my production because in order to keep nine guys fully employed and busy, it takes volume. I just wasn’t able to manage a business, employees and shape that many boards a day by hand. I learned to use the technologies to help in the production, but hand-shaping is equally as important and critical to my business.\n\nWith each design idea and concept for a certain board model that has specific performance goals, I typically go through an R&D phase. I hand-shape iterations (sometimes 10 to 20) of a new model until I arrive at the one that works and has the aesthetics that I envisioned. Then, that final shape is scanned and programmed to be milled on the CNC machine. The outcome is that I can maintain the quality and consistency of every board and have the ability to scale the master shape’s dimensions by length, width and thickness.\n\nWhat is your favorite board? And favorite surf spot?\n\nI have a lot of go-to boards for certain conditions that I know will work, but most of the time I’m trying new concepts and testing them. In that regard, I really don’t have a favorite board.\n\nLa Saladita, Mexico for longboards. It’s a left and when the swell and size is right, it can break just like Malibu. For shortboards, it would have to be Tavarua— Cloudbreak and Restaurants. Both are places that I know the wave will be near perfect and always break the same year after year.\n\nWhat do you love about surfing?\n\nWhen surfing, the two favorite places I like to be are on the nose or in the tube.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you have learned in your life?\n\nThe greatest lesson I have learned is how to manage my life, relationships and finances so that everything is in balance.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nThat I believed in myself and persevered. In high school, my career counselor kept telling me I needed to go to summer school or I wouldn’t graduate high school. He said, “What are you going to do?” I told him I was going to make surfboards. He told me, “You can’t do that!” Everyone told me I couldn’t make a living making surfboards. I sometimes regret not going to college, and I think I got pretty lucky. I usually tell kids that have an interest in shaping to go to school first to have something to fall back on.\n\nWhat brings you the most happiness in the world?\n\nWhen my life is in balance. When my guys have work. When Margaret and I are getting along well and everyone around me is healthy. I don’t consider myself materialistic, so I don’t need a lot of unnecessary things. I’m grateful for what I’ve got.\n\nWhat’s your favorite meal?\n\nGrowing up in an Italian household, it’s pretty much anything Italian. The runner-up is sushi.\n\nWhat kind of music do you listen to?\n\nAnything that sounds good or inspires me.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nMy family and friends. And for Margaret Yao, who is the best thing that ever happened to me and who will become my wife this fall.\n\nWhat’s next for Matt Calvani?\n\nI’m going to expand the Bing line of alternative shortboards with my team rider, Chris Del Moro. He’s a super talented surfer and person, and it’s one of those shaper and surfer relationships that happens so rarely. So we are looking forward to the results from his involvement and the impact it will have on the Bing brand.\n\nFind out more about Matt Calvani and Bing Surfboards here. Matt Calvani is also shaper for Jacobs Surfboards.\n\nPrue Jeffries is a talented California surfer born and raised in Australia. She recently appeared in a film about the history of women’s surfing, Dear and Yonder. Formerly a competitive surfer, Prue now spends her time surfing for the sheer pleasure of it and practicing holistic healing for others. We spoke with Prue to learn more.\n\nWhat was your life like as a young child?\n\nI grew up in Sydney, and my childhood revolved around being around the beach and being in the water all day. I started surfing because of my dad. I spent a lot of time surfing with him and a lot of the boys in the neighborhood. I had two brothers and a lot of uncles who were always doing something, so I grew up with a lot of activity. When I was young, I also tended to ask a lot of questions. Not all of them were answered to my satisfaction back then. I imagine it probably wasn’t very easy on the adults!\n\nDo you remember the first time you stood up on a surfboard?\n\nYeah. It’s funny because my middle brother and I would egg each other on when we were little. He used to surf and I was body boarding at the time. I used to watch him. I didn’t want to do just the whitewater thing. I remember standing up and riding the green face and that feeling in my stomach like I was going down a big hill. My heart was in my mouth, butterflies in my tummy and in awe of how beautiful water is as it moves.\n\nTell us about your first board.\n\nIt wasn’t mine, but a community board! In Australia, they have these foam boards called “foamies” and that’s what you learn on. Eventually, I progressed to a fiberglass board. It was a board I borrowed from my uncle, a red single fin. It was my first real board that I learned to surf on.\n\nWho did you look up to and admire when you were a young girl?\n\nI was odd in the sense I didn’t really look up to anybody. However, there were certain qualities I admired in people—people who were more generous in nature, quiet, kind. When it came to surfers I could look to, it would be people like Tom Curren …those who were a bit quiet and humble with their abilities. I also read books by Krishnamurti and had admiration for those types of people.\n\nYou have a deep interest in spirituality. Can you tell us more?\n\nI remember being a small girl wondering, “Why am I here?” It was a very significant question for someone being of a young age. I still don’t have that explanation. (Laughs) I don’t need to anymore, and I that is a big difference. It is something innate I was born with. Different things in my life have made me aware of how important that is for me. I spent time in the library reading books written by the Dalai Lama or those kind of subjects.\n\nEven while I was competing, I was reading things like the Tao Te Ching. I had a lot of conflict about my spirituality and competing. For ten years, I simply could not put the two together. There was a lot I learned about being human and being in the world. When I stopped competing, I was really happy. Finally, I didn’t have to be someone other than what I already am.\n\nTell us about your other interests\n\nI’ve been working on something for the past couple of years. It is a healing art called BelliWay. And I love it more than surfing. (Laughs) I was looking for something that can make me as happy as surfing. It’s about helping other people. I’ve had a lot of people put a lot of energy into helping me and my career. I never forgot that and it had quite an impact on me and my life. Now I can give back. It’s like surfing because every person who walks in the door is different—just like every wave. You never know what is going to happen.\n\nWhat is it about surfing that you are drawn to?\n\nBefore surfing, I was a high-strung person and I needed an outlet. Surfing definitely provided that for me. Now that I am away from competing, when I do go in the water it is to connect and enjoy what the ocean is. All that stuff about competing has just fallen away. Before, I couldn’t imagine why people would just sit in the water and socialize. I would think, “What are these people doing?” Now, it is okay for me to just go out and enjoy it with friends. It really helps me to be in the moment and not really think about much.\n\nTell us about your experience being a part of the Dear & Yonder film.\n\nI wasn’t really thinking about surfing much when Thomas (Campbell) called me. We had a long conversation about it and I was like. “Yeah! That’s cool!” Then I didn’t hear from him in a few months. Finally, Thomas and his wife, Tiffany, invited me to be a part of the film and wanted me to come down to shoot at Saludita, Mexico. It was funny because the break they wanted to film at, I had already gone down there previously with Linda Benson and some friends a little earlier. It was a real surprise as I have not been involved in the surfing industry for a couple of years. I was real thankful for the opportunity. The whole crew was so chill; it was a really laid back experience, probably one of the most positive experiences I have had in my career.\n\nWhat meaning does surfing hold for you and how has it changed your life?\n\nSurfing is a source of peace for me. It was originally a physical outlet, as I had an abundance of energy that needed channeling. It has changed my life as I traveled so extensively, through surfing, that I have had experiences and connections with so many diverse and different people. It has shaped where I am now and who I have become in a very broad way.\n\nWho are some of the people you feel are shaping the path for surfing today?\n\nI would say anyone that surfs and is happy to be exactly who they are.\n\nWho or what inspires you?\n\nPeople that are fearless with their search of truth.\n\nWhat brings you the most happiness in the world?\n\nFeeling love in my heart. Seeing children play.\n\nWhat are you riding these days and what is your favorite surf spot?\n\nMy quiver consists of mainly fishes these days. My favorite is my Donald Takayama 5’4” quad with Halo fins. He calls it the Huma Huma Nuku A Pua’a. Every time he makes me a new board, it goes just a little bit faster. (Laughs) I like the glide and speed. There is an effortlessness to the fish that I quite like.\n\nI live in Encinitas, so I am always at Pipes. If I had a choice to go travel again, I would probably go to Pasta Point in the Maldives or the beach breaks in Hossegor, France.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal?\n\nThe thing I do get cravings for is Vietnamese vegetarian phở. Anything vegetarian – tofu, broccoli. And, of course, chocolate.\n\nWhat kind of music do you listen to?\n\nI have been on a classical bend for a couple months—Vivaldi and some Puccini. When I was younger, I listened to a lot of heavy metal. But these days, I cannot bear it any more. I don’t mind some upbeat music here and there, like jazz, but basically if I had a preference, it would be classical. (Laughs)\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nLife, the ability to love and the people to love too.\n\nWhat’s next for Prue Jeffries?\n\nContinue to develop our BelliWay. I’ll be focused on getting that up and going!\n\nFind out more about Prue Jeffries and BelliWay here and here.\n\nPhotographs of Prue Jeffries courtesy of Tiffany Campbell.\n\nJeff Johnson is a California surfer/writer/photographer who stars in Woodshed Films’ 180° South – A trip that mirrors the legendary journey of Yvon Chouinard and Doug Tompkins. An accomplished writer, his works have appeared in Surfer’s Journal, Surfer, and Alpinist. We spent some time with Jeff to learn more.\n\nWhat was your childhood like?\n\nI grew up in Danville, California in the East Bay San Francisco. Lots of open space in my neighborhood—very few fences. Grassy, rolling hills. Oak trees and walnut orchards. The girls rode horses. The guys rode motorbikes.\n\nWhen I was about 12 or 13 years old, I quit all the team sports, got a haircut and a skateboard, and was immediately at odds with all the jocks, parents and teachers. Suddenly, I had a new, small group of disenchanted friends who all felt the same about our surroundings. We wanted out.\n\nIn the 80’s, surfing still had an outlaw/counterculture vibe. I was naturally attracted to it. I started surfing when I was old enough drive to the coast. It took over my life. It’s all I wanted to do. I moved to Hawaii just after high school graduation in 1987. I was back and fourth till I moved permanently to the North Shore of Oahu in 1990. This was my home base for about 15 years.\n\nWhen did you get your first surfboard?\n\nThere was a guy named Jimmy Olson who lived on my block when I was a kid. He was about four to five years older than me. The guy was like a god to me. He and his buddies were the only surfers in Danville. They looked different and acted different. He built surfboards in his garage, start to finish. When I was about 15, he took me to a remote pointbreak north of Santa Cruz. He told me it was a “secret spot” and we were “kooks” from inland. I took this as a warning: Secret spot, good. Kooks, bad. I caught my first wave that day, but it didn’t really get me till a year or so later. Then, he sold me a used board. I think it was a 6’0” thruster with shallow rocker, full rails, wide tail—full-on 80’s board.\n\nWhat was the feeling you had when you first stood on a surfboard?\n\nIt was an overwhelming sensation—all this water moving beneath me. I felt weightless watching the water pass by the rails. It making me kinda dizzy. I couldn’t believe this sensory overload taking place in only a few seconds. These seconds I played over and over in my head as I lay in bed that night. The bug. I remember not wanting to rinse off the salt the ocean left on my body—laying there with salty hair dreaming of the next wave.\n\nWho did you look up to and admire when you were a young boy?\n\nMy dad has always been my biggest hero. He was once a ski patrol, an excellent skier. Still is! He had me snow skiing when I was four years old. He’d wake me up at four in the morning to drive to Tahoe. I’d sleep on the floorboards of the truck and would wake up with the first light at Donner Pass. It was so great to watch him move over snow—so graceful and fluid. I’d try my hardest to emulate him. Those early years had a huge impact on me. I still love waking up long before the sun and going on crazy missions. You eventually become your parents, you know. I’ve become my dad in many ways.\n\nI was skating in the era of Christian Hosoi and all the Bones Brigade guys, but I was into learning about Jay Adams and Stacy Peralta. I’d search for all those old Stecyk articles and Friedman photos. I’d learn their old tricks and mixed it up with the new ones.\n\nAs I got into surfing, I didn’t care who won the world title—you’d think I’d be into Potts or Curren or whoever was hot at the time. But, I was into reading about Miki Dora and Pat Curren, Mead Hall and the North Shore in the 50’s and 60’s.\n\nAs a climber, it was Yvon Chouinard and Royal Robbins and Yosemite’s Camp 4 in the 60’s.\n\nAll these guys were way before my time, but they were the ones I looked up to and still do.\n\nWhat inspired you to become a storyteller?\n\nMy Dad is a great storyteller. His stories are so good that I often tell them myself. Even now, he’ll say, “Have I ever told you about … ?” And I will say “no” just so I can hear the story again.\n\nI didn’t start reading till after high school—then I continued incessantly. Authors like Charles Bukowski, Cormac McCarthy, James Salter, John Fante have inspired me to write and share stories.\n\nWhat was it about Yvon Chouinard and Doug Tompkins that inspired you to create 180 South?\n\nAround 10 years ago, my friend Amy Kumler handed me a dusty old videocassette tape. She worked for Patagonia and said she found it locked up in a vault. She had to sneak it out of there because no one outside the office was supposed to see it. “Mountain of Storms” was written on it. Chris Malloy and I popped it in the VCR one evening. It blew our minds. In 1968, Doug and Yvon and friends drove a van from Ventura, California to Patagonia, Chile to climb Mount Fitzroy. They surfed the way down there, climbed live volcanoes and basically goofed off. They filmed the entire thing. But it was what these two men later became. Yvon would come home and name his clothing company Patagonia. Doug, who had already started and sold The North Face, would create the clothing company Esprit with his wife.\n\nDoug sold his share of Esprit in the late 80s. He put all his money into creating the world’s biggest privately-owned land conservation project down in Patagonia. Yvon’s environmental efforts with his company, Patagonia, would set a standard on the outdoor industry and have an effect on the way business is done worldwide. We knew right away that this forgotten film we were watching was the beginning of a journey for these two men. It was the trip that changed their lives.\n\nChris had made some successful surf films already. We were inspired to do a similar trip (either following in their footsteps or something in the same spirit) and make a film about it. In 2006, it all started to come together as 180 South … a dream come true.\n\nHow are surfing and climbing similar?\n\nThey are both about working with nature rather than trying to control it. This kind of effort attracts a certain individual—one who is open and creative. So, it’s not as much the actual acts that are similar. It’s the culture.\n\nOf all the places you have traveled to, what place in particular stands out? And why?\n\nI would have to say Rapa Nui/Easter Island. I sailed through there on my way to Chile while filming 180 South. I had always wanted to go there. I’ve been all over Polynesia and going to the furthest corner intrigued me—the most remote habitable piece of land on Earth. It has the most interesting history, too. The island is in a really good place right now.\n\nI found some fun surf there, too. There’s no perfect set-ups, mostly peaky, ledgy reefs. Small waves and some big wave spots. You can surf alone if you want.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing you have learned in your life?\n\nCompassion.\n\nDo you have any regrets or wish you had done something differently?\n\nI’m really stoked right now. If I had done something differently, my life right now might be totally different. So, I guess I have no regrets. You can always look back and see how you could have done something better. But that’s how life is. It would suck if you did everything perfectly; it’d be boring.\n\nWhat are you most proud of?\n\nFollowing my heart, sticking to my guns, like my heroes have taught me.\n\nWhat meaning does surfing hold for you and how has it changed your life?\n\nWhen I was heavily into skating, I was kinda going down a crooked path—spending time in The City, doing drugs, getting arrested and so on. Then, surfing came along and demanded a healthier lifestyle. I wasn’t gonna show up at the beach in my leather jacket all f*cked up. Not to say surfing kept me out of trouble … just a different kind of trouble.\n\nI knew surfing could be a long life for me. Do it till you die. I watch what I eat. I stay fit. Do a little yoga here and there. I still skate, but surfing became a lifestyle for me. The addiction forced me to work odd jobs. It led me to Hawaii, sent me around the world, introduced me to so many people, friends, culture. Without it, I’d be a totally different person.\n\nWhat brings you the most happiness in the world?\n\nThis might sound cliché but … freedom.\n\nWho are some of the people you feel are shaping the path for surfing today?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nWhat is your favorite board? Your favorite surf spot?\n\nRight now I’m riding this board Fletcher Chouinard made for me. It’s a 5’8” quad, wide like a fish, shallow rocker … super fast. I rode his on our last trip to Indonesia and was freaking out on it, so I had him make me one. You can glide through flat sections like on a fish, but then you can turn it on a dime too. It works really well in slow, mushy crap and it performs in overhead surf as well. The board is a variation of the Quark model, so he calls it the Fark.\n\nAs far as my favorite surf spot? That’s a tough one. Though I never really dedicated myself to it while living on the North Shore for all those years, but I’d have to say Backdoor. I got some of the best waves of my life there. Nothing compares. Living in California now, I’d say its right-hand pointbreaks. Even my friends in Hawaii froth over the pointbreaks here when they’re on.\n\nWhat’s your favorite meal?\n\nWhen you’ve been surfing all day, you’re starving, and you’re in the middle of nowhere and your buddy hands you a sloppy peanut butter and jelly sandwich? I’d say that is the best meal ever. My favorite.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to on your iPod?\n\nI’ve been tripping on these freaks from Malibu lately—a guy named Blake Mills, and a band called Daws. They both used to be in a band called Simon Daws—way ahead of their time. The White Buffalo, Ugly Cassanova, Wilco, Metallica’s first three albums—out of control good. Mason Jennings, Todd Hannigan, White Stripes. Local band here in Ventura called Rey Fresco—killing it. Mozart when I read or write. X is always in there—one of my all-time favorite bands. A little Devo here and there. Driving back from Yosemite the other day, I listened to Neil Young for four hours; all this bootleg live stuff with a small audience. What a legend! Still making relevant music after all these years.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nAnother cliché …having the best friends in the world and a supportive family.\n\nWhat’s next for Jeff Johnson?\n\nI have no idea. First, I’m gonna get up and out of this chair.\n\nFind out more about Jeff Johnson here. For more details about the film 180° South click here.
