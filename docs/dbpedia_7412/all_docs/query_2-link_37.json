        "text": "Deryck Whibley didn't know Heaven :x: Hell was going to be Sum 41's final album when he began the process of making it.\n\n\"I was just listening to it as a finished record to see how close it was to being done — and it was almost done — but I thought, 'This to me feels like a record that I could call our last record.' I feel so proud of it, and it encapsulates the entire sound of the band and everything that we've tried to do over the years. It's all in one record,\" he explains over Zoom from his home in Las Vegas.\n\nTo be fair, the Sum 41 frontman, 44, had spent the past five years contemplating a future without the band that has defined him since their punk rock beginnings in 1996. \"I always knew if I was ever going to do something, I can't do two things at once,\" he explains. \"I didn't ever have a date or a time — I just knew it would kind of hit me.\"\n\nAmid the release of their 2001 debut album All Killer No Filler and the height of Warped Tour, Sum 41 became pop-punk pioneers of the early aughts. The five-piece — comprised of Whibley, Dave Baksh (guitar, backing vocals), Jason McCaslin (bass, backing vocals), Tom Thacker (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals), and Frank Zummo (drums, percussion, occasional backing vocals) — has since released seven more albums, even earning a GRAMMY nomination in 2012 for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for the song \"Blood in My Eyes.\" Over the years, they've toured with artists including Good Charlotte, The Offspring, Mötley Crüe and many other titans in the punk and pop-punk world.\n\nWith their eighth studio album, Whibley believes it's the band's \"complete work.\" The 20-track Heaven:x: Hell is a testament to the band's expansive punk sound throughout their nearly three-decade-long career: Heaven's 10 tracks channel the energetic pop-punk sound that brought them to the forefront of the Warped Tour scene; while Hell taps into the band's affinity for experimentation and heavier elements with bombastic riffs and explosive anthems. To culminate their tenure, Sum 41 will hit the road for a massive farewell tour, kicking off on April 19 in Omaha and concluding with their final show in their native Toronto on Jan. 30, 2025.\n\nFor Whibley, life after Sum 41 remains a question mark. Perhaps he'll work on a solo project or maybe he'll work on some scripts. Ultimately, he believes that once he's faced with the uncertainty of his own future, his heart will gravitate toward what excites him the most. \"I love music,\" he sighs, \"but I like to think that there might be something else out there.\"\n\nAs the end of Sum 41 approaches, Whibley reminisces on the breadth of experiences the band has had over the years. Below, he details seven of his most career-defining moments to date.\n\nPlaying Warped Tour In 2001\n\nWe started the band by going to the first Vans Warped Tour that came through Toronto [in 1995]. All the bands that we were obsessed with at the time [were there] — NOFX, Pennywise, Face To Face, Unwritten Law, all these California punk rock bands. We were already in a band but as a different band [called Kaspir], and we just thought, This is the kind of music we listen to. This is the kind of tour we want to be on. We want to play with these bands and be like these guys. We need to start a new band. That was the moment we decided, let's start a band that could be one day on a tour like this.\n\nSo six years later, we ended up getting [on] the tour, and we became friends with a lot of those guys, like The Vandals, Pennywise. Fat Mike was on the tour. He wasn't with NOFX, but he was with another band. We used to be just watching them from the front of the stage. Now we're hanging out backstage, and we're parking our tour buses next to each other every single day on the whole tour for two and a half months, every single day. It just became this great thing.\n\nIt was also at the same time as our first record, All Killer No Filler,was taking off and our first single, \"Fat Lip,\" was taking off in the middle of that tour. So when we started, we were on MTV, but it wasn't a big song yet, and as the summer went on, it just got bigger and bigger. So we saw the growth happen while we were out on that tour. Everything really exploded in that summer on that tour.\n\nPerforming With Tommy Lee & Judas Priest's Rob Halford At MTV's 20th Anniversary\n\nThat was in August [2001], and we were on Warped Tour — we had to take a little break to go over to New York and do [the MTV performance]. That came last-second. When we started Warped Tour, we were on MTV, but it just started and in mid-July, [\"Fat Lip\" was doing really well.\n\nWe were still a new band, but MTV asked us to come and perform at their anniversary bash, and we were going to open the show. So in our minds, we were like, \"Why don't we do something cool that we've seen before?\" They do collaboration stuff with like Run DMC, and Aerosmith and stuff like that. So we asked if we could do that, and they said, \"Sure. Who are you thinking about?\"\n\nWe threw out a couple of names and we were like, \"Let's ask Tommy Lee, let's ask Rob Halford and we'll place some of these songs.\" We even said, \"Let's see if we can get Slash from Guns N' Roses and the Beastie Boys. Both Slash and the Beastie Boys were like, \"We're not going to show up. We're not doing that thing.\" But Tommy and Rob were like, \"F— yeah, sounds great.\"\n\nSo we met in New York, the night before the show, and worked on this little medley of different songs from Sum 41. We did a Beastie Boys song, we did a Mötley Crüe song, we did a Judas Priest song. We threw it together really quickly.When we opened the show, I thought we played like s—. Because when [we were] on stage, it just didn't sound good in our monitors. It felt a little weird, and you're playing to a lot of industry people. So you don't know if people like it or not.\n\nWe walked off stage, not really knowing if that was good or bad. But it all kind of blew up for us. When we walked off stage, the heads of MTV came by and they were just saying, like, \"That was phenomenal. We're gonna have a great relationship together. You guys are the next big thing. We're gonna get behind your whole thing.\"\n\nFrom that moment on, our video went into heavy rotation the next morning, it went all over the world, and \"Fat Lip\" became a No. 1 song. It just turned into a whole thing. That next day, we flew back to the Warped Tour, and our friends — all those bands — had watched it, and everybody was like, \"You guys are going to be massive. After that, nothing's gonna be the same.\" And it never was. Everything just took off from that moment on.\n\nTouring With The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\n\nWe were really young — this was still in the van days — and it was only the second tour we'd ever done of America. Flogging Molly was the [other] support band. Right from day one, even though we were these kids that nobody ever heard of, both the Bosstones and Flogging Molly treated us like family. We all became this great family for this whole tour.\n\nWe would go on the Bosstones' bus and Dicky Barrett, the singer, taught us all how to play dice and gamble. He took all our money every single night. He didn't even care that we were completely broke kids in a van who barely had $20 between all of us. We lost, he took it all. [Laughs]\n\nWatching [the Bosstones] every night was also such a learning experience. They would get in all their suits, and they all went out on stage. [Dicky] had a character. He's a character off stage, but he even had more of a heightened character on stage. He had banter and bits that he would do every single night. And I realized, \"Oh it's a show. You're putting on a real show.\" It's not just off the cuff — he put some time and effort into making it entertaining.\n\nThe other thing that was memorable about that tour was Dicky and I both kind of had a similar hairstyle, and within like five or six shows, all of a sudden, he started calling me his son. People thought we were related.\n\nA couple shows into it, the Bosstones were on stage, and I kept hearing over the PA, \"'Deryck, where is he? Get Deryck up here.\" I'm backstage, and people are saying, \"Hey, Dicky's calling you out on stage.' I didn't know for what. I walked out on stage, and he goes, \"There he is, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for my son.\"\n\nThe whole crowd starts cheering. He does this whole bit where he's like, \"I haven't seen my son in 20 years. This is my way of getting to know him, bringing him on tour.\" And he kept that bit up every single night to a point where if I see him, I saw him a couple of months ago, he still calls me his son. I still call him Dad. And that was from 23 years ago. He's my punk-rock dad.\n\nSetting Their First Tour Bus On Fire\n\nWe were so used to touring in vans, and we used to tour in this old 1982 Ford Econoline that had no air conditioning, no heat or anything. It had holes in the floor, so if you were driving in the rain or the snow, all the rain and snow would come through on your feet.\n\nSo finally, we get to the point where we're big enough that we're gonna get a tour bus. We were so excited, and we were pretty young. I mean, we're like 19 or 20 years old at that point, and we used to party all the time. We thought we were like Mötley Crüe — we just partied all day all night.\n\nThe first night that we had the bus, I said on stage, \"Hey, everybody, we just got our first tour bus. After the show, we're gonna have a party, so you guys are all invited.\" We kept doing it every night, but that first night, there was a lineup of 1,000 people trying to get on the bus, and our tour manager was there to allow a few people on and check IDs. But our bus was crammed with people.\n\nWe ended up partying really late, and I think one of us — it might have been me or it might have been Steve [Jocz], our drummer — was making food. It was 5 a.m., and we all passed out while the food was cooking. The toaster oven caught on fire and the whole bus filled with smoke.\n\nFinally, it woke somebody up, and you couldn't see anything. The whole bus was filled with smoke, and this thing was on fire. Obviously, we got it out and everything, [so] then we drove.\n\nWhen we woke up the next day — probably in the afternoon — there was some random person who had passed out in the back lounge from the other city. We're now seven hours away somewhere else, so we had to wake this guy up. We were like, \"We don't even know who this guy is.\" He's like, \"Oh s—, I live in Pittsburgh.\" I was like, \"You've got to get a train or something.\"[Laughs.]\n\nEarning An MTV Music Video Award Nomination\n\nWe were so excited and nervous. We were so brand new to this whole thing, and it was also in that heyday of pop music, so really big pop superstars were there — NSYNC, Britney [Spears] and Christina [Aguilera] — they were all the big talk the whole thing. We're these kids that were just touring in a van that all of a sudden are now at these awards with all these superstars.\n\nI remember the night before, we went out to a bar, we did a bunch of mushrooms, and we got really drunk. Other people from the award show [were] there, too. Nikka Costa was there, and she came by our table. Somebody introduced us, and our bass player ended up vomiting all over her feet when she came over to say \"hello\" because he was so high and drunk at the same time.\n\nWe ended up going to the awards show the next day [where] we were up for the Best New Artist award. And I remember Alicia Keys was up for it because it was her first single, [\"Fallin'\"]. None of us knew much about each other. We were all brand-new artists. And she went up to go perform that song — it was before our award was announced — and she was so f—ing incredible.\n\nIt was so amazing that instantly, I just was like, \"I don't want to win this award now. After seeing that, we don't deserve it. This person deserves this award. She's clearly talented, and we're just some punk band [that] can barely play our instruments.\"\n\nThen right after she was done, they said, and now the nominees for Best New Artist. The entire time I'm saying, \"Please don't win. Please don't win. Please don't win.\" And they say, \"The winner is Alicia Keys.\" And I was like, \"Yes! Thank God it was not us.\"\n\nGetting GRAMMY Recognition\n\nOne of the most unexpected phone calls I ever got was in 2011 from our manager telling me that we were nominated for our first GRAMMY. It was for a song called \"Blood In My Eyes.\"\n\nNot only was it an incredible honor, but it was for a song that our record company didn't think should be recorded for our album at the time. The reason they didn't want to have it on the album was because I was taking a long time to get the recording right and they felt I was dragging the process on and on.\n\nI put my foot down and got the song finished and for it to have been nominated for the highest musical honor was complete validation for all the time and work I put into the making of that song.\n\nMaking Heaven :x: Hell & Announcing Their Final Tour\n\nIt's a strange \"best moment\" because it is the end. When we announced that this was going to be a final album [and] final tour, I was not expecting it to be anything surprising, or for many people to really care. I felt like our core fan base would be upset, but I wasn't expecting much of a reaction. It was such a bigger reaction than I could ever imagine.\n\nWhen we put [out] the tour [dates], shows were selling out, and we're adding second dates, and that was selling out. Everything just blew up into a thing that I was not expecting.\n\nSo although it's bittersweet and sad that it's the end, in some ways, I'm happy. But I know there's a lot of people in our world that are upset by it. It was such a surprising moment for me to see how much people do care because I wasn't expecting that.\n\nThe way I work on things is that I put all my focus and energy and attention into one thing. I always knew if I was ever going to do something [other than Sum 41], I can't do two things at once, and would I ever get to a point where I'd walk away? I'm so focused on making this final tour the best it can be as a final tour. The point of this, for me, is to go try to find something new and do something different.\n\nSo I don't really think about, \"In a few years, we'll get back together.\" The goal is, this is a chapter I'm closing, and it's been great, but I would love to create a new chapter that's great. That's the plan. I don't know what that is.\n\nI think anything's possible, but it's also so possible that we never play together again. I have no plans for it. It's very possible we never get on stage together again, but I can't say \"Never say never\" because I don't know. Life is life, and you can't predict anything.\n\nThe State Of Pop-Punk: A Roundtable Unpacks The Genre's Past, Present And Future\n\nMarch is Women’s History Month, and women in music are more powerful than ever.\n\nThe month begins with the comeback of several queens, starting with Kim Gordon’s The Collective and Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine. Later, country darling Kacey Musgraves will unveil Deeper Well, and Shakira will drop the empowering Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. Long-awaited debuts by GRAMMY-winning singer Tyla and singer/bassist Blu DeTiger will also join the lineup, with their respective Tyla and All I Ever Want Is Everything. Wrapping up March on a high note, Beyoncé will drop her highly-anticipated Act II on the 29th.\n\nMen will release music in March as well: Expect new releases by Justin Timberlake, Bleachers, the last record from pop-punk band Sum 41, and (allegedly) Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 2.\n\nTo make the most of this prolific time, GRAMMY.com compiled all the must-hear albums dropping March 2024.\n\nSchoolboy Q - Blue Lips\n\nRelease date: March 1\n\nOn Feb. 1, Schoolboy Q’s website was updated with a mysterious countdown and a 37-second video. In it, the rapper finally unveiled the setlist and title of his much-awaited sixth studio album, Blue Lips, as well as its release date — March 1.\n\nBlue Lips is Q’s first full record since 2019’s Crash Talk, although he had been teasing the album since 2020. Hopefully, it was worth the wait: Blue Lips holds 18 tracks and participations by Rico Nasty, Freddie Gibbs, and more. Q has also started a new vlog series on social media called \"wHy not?,\" where he takes the viewers behind the scenes of making the album and previews snippets of the songs.\n\nSo far, the rapper shared tracks \"Blueslides,\" \"Back n Love\" with Devin Malik, \"Cooties\" and \"Love Birds\" with Devin Malik and Lance Skiiwalker, as well as lead single \"Yeern 101.\"\n\nBleachers - Bleachers\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFronted by 10-time GRAMMY winner and 2024 Producer Of The Year Jack Antonoff, rock band Bleachers will release its eponymous fourth studio album on March 8.\n\nIn a press release, Bleachers is described as Antonoff’s \"distinctly New Jersey take on the bizarre sensory contradictions of modern life.\" The self-titled record will blend sadness and joy into \"music for driving on the highway to, for crying to and for dancing to at weddings.\"\n\nThe band shared four singles so far: lead track \"Modern Girl,\" \"Alma Mater\" featuring Lana del Rey, \"Tiny Moves\" and \"Me Before You.\" Through serendipitous melodies and soulful writing, Bleachers commit to \"exist in crazy times but remember what counts.\"\n\nBleachers will tour the U.K. in March and the U.S. in May and June.\n\nKim Gordon - The Collective\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFormer Sonic Youth vocalist Kim Gordon will release her sophomore LP, The Collective, on March 8. The album is a follow-up to her 2019 debut No Home Record, and furthers her collaboration with producer Justin Raisen, as well as additional producing from Anthony Paul Lopez.\n\n\"On this record, I wanted to express the absolute craziness I feel around me right now,\" said Gordon in a press statement. \"This is a moment when nobody really knows what truth is, when facts don’t necessarily sway people, when everyone has their own side, creating a general sense of paranoia. To soothe, to dream, escape with drugs, TV shows, shopping, the internet, everything is easy, smooth, convenient, branded. It made me want to disrupt, to follow something unknown, maybe even to fail.\"\n\nBack in January, the singer unveiled the album’s moody first single, \"Bye Bye,\" and a music video starring her daughter, Coco Gordon Moore. The second single, \"I’m A Man,\" came out in February. Gordon will play six concerts in support of The Collective, starting March 21 in Burlington, Vermont.\n\nAriana Grande - Eternal Sunshine\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nIt’s been almost four years since Ariana Grande’s last studio album, 2020’s Positions. The starlet spent the past few years filming Wicked, an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, and declared that she wouldn’t be releasing any new records until it was done.\n\nThe wait is finally over, as Grande announced her seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine. The album’s first and only single, \"Yes, And?,\" dropped in January, followed by an Instagram video of the soprano singer explaining the concept of the album to her Republic Records team.\n\n\"It’s kind of a concept album ’cause it’s all different heightened pieces of the same story, of the same experience,\" she said. \"Some of [the songs] are really vulnerable, some of them are like playing the part of what people kind of expect me to be sometimes and having fun with it.\"\n\n\"I think this one may be your favorite,\" Grande wrote of Eternal Sunshine on her Instagram Story. \"It is mine.\" The 13-song collection will reportedly explore house and R&B, and will have only one feature: Grande’s grandmother, who appears on the last track, \"Ordinary Things.\"\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign -Vultures 2\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nAfter a series of delays, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s first collaborative album, Vultures 1, ultimately dropped on Feb. 10, 2024. Set to be the first installment of a trilogy, the album was released independently through West’s YZY label, and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with all of its 16 tracks also charting on Billboard’s Hot 100.\n\nBilled as ¥$, the duo plans to release Vultures 2 on March 8, and follow up with Vultures 3 on April 5. Although any other info about the upcoming volumes is still unclear, Timbaland recently shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Vultures 2 is \"OTW.\" (Timbaland produced Vultures 1’s \"Keys to My Life\" and \"Fuk Sumn\" with Playboi Carti and Travis Scott.)\n\nIn the past month, West and $ign held a few listening parties for the album in the U.S. and Europe, but additional schedules are yet to be revealed.\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain - Glasgow Eyes\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nTo celebrate their 40th anniversary, alt-rock band the Jesus and Mary Chain will release their eighth studio album, Glasgow Eyes, on March 8.\n\nAs it can be seen on lead single \"Jamcod,\" the Scottish group still runs strong on the distorted synths and electrifying guitars that shaped their sound. \"People should expect a Jesus and Mary Chain record, and that’s certainly what Glasgow Eyes is,\" vocalist Jim Reid said in a statement. \"Our creative approach is remarkably the same as it was in 1984, just hit the studio and see what happens. We went in with a bunch of songs and let it take its course. There are no rules, you just do whatever it takes.\"\n\nGlasgow Eyes also mends a six-year gap since the Jesus and Mary Chain’s latest album, 2017’s Damage and Joy. To further commemorate, the band will also release an autobiography and embark on a European tour throughout March and April.\n\nJustin Timberlake - Everything I Thought It Was\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nJustin Timberlake is back with his first studio album since 2018’s Man of the Woods. The new record, Everything I Thought It Was, is spearheaded by singles \"Selfish\" and \"Drown.\"\n\n\"I worked for a long time on this album, and I ended up with 100 songs. So, narrowing them down to 18 was a thing,\" said Timberlake in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1. \"I’m really excited about this album. I think every artist probably says this, but it is my best work.\" The Memphis singer also shared that there are \"incredibly honest\" moments in the album, but also \"a lot of f—ng fun.\"\n\nTo celebrate his return, Timberlake announced his Forget Tomorrow World Tour. Set to kick off on April 29 in Vancouver, the tour will cross through North America and Europe until its final date on Dec. 16 in Indianapolis.\n\nKacey Musgraves - Deeper Well\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nFresh off winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 2024 GRAMMYs for the Zach Bryan duet \"I Remember Everything,\" Kacey Musgraves announced her fifth studio album, Deeper Well..\n\n\"My Saturn has returned/ When I turned 27/ Everything started to change,\" she sings in the contemplative title track, exploring how she changed over the last few years. The single sets the tone for the rest of the record, which was co-produced by longtime collaborators Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian.\n\nFeaturing 14 tracks, Deeper Well was mostly recorded at the legendary Electric Lady studios in New York City. \"I was seeking some different environmental energy, and Electric Lady has the best mojo. Great ghosts,\" the country star noted in a press release.\n\nOn social media, Musgraves wrote: \"it’s a collection of songs I hold very dear to my heart. I hope it makes a home in all of your hearts, too.\" Deeper Well follows 2021’s star-crossed.\n\nTierra Whack - World Wide Whack\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nWhen rapper Tierra Whack released her first album, 2018’s Whack World, she quickly garnered the admiration of both critics and fans. Comprising 15 one-minute tracks and music videos for each, the release was a refreshing introduction to a groundbreaking artist.\n\nIn 2024, the Philadelphia-born star is preparing to release World Wide Whack, labeled her official debut album in a press release. The cover artwork, created by Alex Da Corte, was inspired by theater character Pierrot, fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli and Donna Summer, and represents \"the first reveal of the World Wide Whack character, an alter ego both untouchable and vulnerable, superhuman and painfully human, whose surprising story will unfold in images and video over the course of the album’s visual rollout.\"\n\nThe album follows Whack’s 2021 EP trilogy — Rap?, Pop? and R&B? — and is foreshadowed by the poignant \"27 Club\" and the eccentric \"Shower Song.\"\n\nTyla - Tyla\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nAfter a glowing 2023 with viral hit \"Water,\" South African newcomer Tyla started 2024 with a blast. Last month, she became the first person to win a GRAMMY for Best African Music Performance, and the youngest-ever African singer to win a GRAMMY Award at 22 years old.\n\nNext month is poised to be even better: Tyla’s eponymous debut LP drops on March 22, featuring \"Water\" and other hits like \"Truth or Dare,\" \"Butterflies\" and \"On and On,\" as well as a guest appearance by labelmate Travis Scott.\n\n\"African music is going global and I’m so blessed to be one of the artists pushing the culture,\" Tyla shared on Instagram. Her unique blend of amapiano, pop and R&B is making waves around the world, and the star will rightfully celebrate by touring Europe and North America throughout this spring.\n\nShakira - Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nThe title of Shakira’s new album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, is a nod to her 2023 hit \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" with Argentine DJ Bizarrap. In the lyrics, she states that \"las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan\" — \"women don’t cry anymore, they make money.\"\n\nThe single is a diss to Shakira’s ex-partner, footballer Gerard Piqué, and, like the rest of the record, served as a healing experience after their separation. \"Making this body of work has been an alchemical process,\" the Colombian star said in a statement. \"While writing each song I was rebuilding myself. While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength.\"\n\nLas Mujeres will feature 16 songs, including her Bizarrap collaboration and singles \"Te Felicito\" with Rauw Alejandro, \"Copa Vacía\" with Manuel Turizo, \"Acróstico,\" \"Monotonía\" with Ozuna, \"El Jefe\" with Mexican band Fuerza Regida, and \"TQG\" with fellow Colombian Karol G.\n\nSheryl Crow - Evolution\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nBack in 2018, Sheryl Crow said that the LP Threads would be her last — fortunately, she changed her mind. \"I said I’d never make another record, though there was no point to it,\" the singer shared in a statement about her upcoming album, Evolution. \"This music comes from my soul. And I hope whoever hears this record can feel that.\"\n\nAccording to the same statement, \"Evolution is Sheryl Crow at her most authentically human self,\" and its music and lyrics \"came from sitting in the quiet and writing from a deep soul place.\"\n\nThe entire album was written in a month, starting with the title track, which expresses Crow’s anxieties about artificial intelligence and the future of humans. From then on, Crow and producer Mike Elizondo found bliss. \"The songs just kept flowing out of me, four songs turned into nine and it was pretty obvious this was an album,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to the album's title track, Crow also shared singles \"Do It Again\" and \"Alarm Clock.\"\n\nSum 41 - Heaven :x: Hell\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nAfter nearly three decades together, punk-metal mavericks Sum 41 are parting ways. Their final release will be a double album. Heaven :x: Hell, set to drop on March 29.\n\nHeaven is composed of 10 pop-punk tracks reminiscent of the band’s early years, while Hell is 10 tracks of pure heavy metal, reflecting the direction they took more recently. \"Once I heard the music, I was confident enough to say, ‘This is the record I’d like to go out on,'\" frontman Deryck Whibley said in a statement. \"We’ve made a double album of pop punk and metal, and it makes sense. It took a long time for us to pave this lane for ourselves, but we did, and it’s unique to us.\"\n\nThe band shared singles \"Landmines,\" \"Rise Up\" and \"Waiting on a Twist of Fate,\" and proved that they’re leaving on top of their game. \"I love Sum 41, what we’ve achieved, endured, and stuck together through, which is why I want to call it quits,\" Whibley added. \"It’s the right time to walk away from it. I’m putting all of my energy into what’s ahead.\"\n\nBut before embarking on new ventures, Sum 41 will spend the rest of the year touring throughout Asia, North America, and Europe.\n\nBlu DeTiger - All I Ever Want Is Everything\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nWhat better event to announce a new album than the most-watched TV program ever? That’s what Beyoncé did during Super Bowl LVIII, on Feb. 11. At the end of a Verizon commercial, the singer declared \"Okay, they ready. Drop the new music,\" while simultaneously releasing Act II’s lead singles, \"16 Carriages\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em,\" on social media and streaming platforms.\n\nComing out March 29, Act II is the second part of Beyoncé’s ongoing trilogy, which was written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic. The album is preceded by 2022’s acclaimed Act I: Renaissance, but instead of house and disco, the singer will reportedly take a deep dive into country music.\n\nThis isn’t Queen Bey’s first foray into the genre — in 2016, she released Lemonade’s \"Daddy Lessons,\" and her 2021 IVY PARK Rodeo collection was inspired by \"the overlooked history of the American Black cowboy,\" as she told Harper’s Bazaar. It was just a question of time for Beyoncé to enter her country era, and it is finally upon us.\n\n17 Love Songs That Have Won GRAMMYs: \"I Will Always Love You,\" \"Drunk In Love\" & More"
