        "text": "Earlier this week, my wonderful and amazing girlfriend (and research queen), Maryhope, reminded me that today, February 28, 2019, marks the 33rd anniversary of the official release of the film (and soundtrack) of one of my all-time favorite 80s films, the cult classic PRETTY IN PINK, written by John Hughes and directed by Howard Deutch, and named after the 1981 Pyschedelic Furs song (which was re-recorded for the film).\n\nPRETTY IN PINK the soundtrack almost didn’t become the soundtrack people have loved for generations now. First-time film director Howard Deutch had wanted more of a film score or theme music kind of soundtrack, but John Hughes talked him out of it, encouraging and influencing him to use New Wave, Post-Punk and maybe lesser-known recording artists (as he used in his previous films).\n\nGrowing up in the 80s in the old Central Maine mill town of Winslow, my knowledge of Modern Rock and Post-Punk had been mostly limited. But, thanks to John Hughes, I got to know about a lot of artists I prolly wouldn’t have known about until much later. Honestly, and I’m sure I’ve mentioned this before on the blog, the PRETTY IN PINK soundtrack was largely responsible for getting me into recording artists like New Order, The Psychedelic Furs, Echo & The Bunnymen, The Smiths and Suzanne Vega.\n\nAt least two of the songs released from the soundtrack were recorded specifically for the film PRETTY IN PINK: “If You Leave” by Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, and “Bring On The Dancing Horses” by Echo & The Bunnymen.\n\nEcho & The Bunnymen started out as a four-man Post-Punk / New Wave band who formed in Liverpool, England in 1978. They had already put out four studio albums and three EP’s by the time PRETTY IN PINK was released. On the U.K. singles chart, between 1982 and 1984, Echo & The Bunnymen had six consecutive Top 40 hits to their credit, including the Top 10 hits, “The Cutter” (No. 8, 1983), and the forever-gorgeous and haunting “The Killing Moon” (No. 9, 1984).\n\nWhen it came time to release their first compilation in 1985, SONGS TO LEARN & SING, Echo & The Bunnymen (most likely at the insistence of John Hughes) recorded a new song for the compilation and also for the upcoming film, PRETTY IN PINK: “Bring On The Dancing Horses.”\n\nIn a late 2018 interview with Songfacts, Echo lead vocalist Ian McCulloch said that the dancing horses, “headless and alone,” are statues. He added, “It’s about the way people would sooner look at statues than themselves. We revere things that tell us about ourselves. It’s that thing of how we think art is very important. A life without art, who knows what that would be like? We think the Mona Lisa is this thing that’s valuable, when something else isn’t.”\n\nThe lovely “Bring On The Dancing Horses” was released in mid-November 1985, a couple of months in advance of PRETTY IN PINK, and it reached No. 21 in the U.K. (to become their seventh consecutive U.K. Top 40 hit, of 10), and the Top 20 in Belgium and Ireland.\n\nTo me, the moderate chart success of “Bring On The Dancing Horses” is far outweighed by its appearance on the PRETTY IN PINK soundtrack. It got me to want to know a whole lot more about Echo & The Bunnymen, and I’ve been a big fan ever since.\n\nThank you, John Hughes, and Happy Anniversary PRETTY IN PINK! The incredible film and its amazing soundtrack (rightfully heralded as one of the best soundtrack albums ever), turned me on to Echo and much more, and I’m forever grateful…\n\n“Bring on the dancing horses / Wherever they may roam…”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_bJf3foa5I\n\nPlayed John Lennon from 1978 to 1980 in productions of BEATLEMANIA on both sides of the United States. Appeared with his band in the 1986 Francis Ford Coppola film, PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED. Played Buddy Holly in 1987 film, LA BAMBA. Golden Globe and Grammy nominee. Songs covered by the likes of Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs, Ronnie Spector and Bette Midler. 10 studio albums, seven EPs, six live albums, six compilations. 1982 self-titled debut album at No. 72 of ROLLING STONE’s 100 Best Albums Of The 80s.\n\nWhen talking about Detroit native Marshall Crenshaw, with all these accomplishments, it’s hard to think of him as a (real) one-hit wonder of the 80s on the BILLBOARD Hot 100, despite the fact that it’s actually true.\n\nAfter the success of 1982’s MARSHALL CRENSHAW album and “Someday, Someway” single, for his second album, the multi-talented singer / songwriter / musician recruited über-producer Steve Lillywhite (U2, Big Country, The Psychedelic Furs, Peter Gabriel, Joan Armatrading) to produce his second album, FIELD DAY.\n\nOriginally, fans weren’t happy with the noticeably sharper-produced album, but ultimately critics heralded FIELD DAY (Robert Christgau gave the album an A+), and fans followed. Though the album didn’t fare as well as his self-titled debut, Marshall Crenshaw avoided the dreaded “sophomore slump” of second albums, and more importantly, he found his feet. Compared to the Power Pop style of the late, great Alex Chilton, Marshall Crenshaw once admitted, “Some of the stuff I’ve done you could call power pop, but the term does have sort of a dodgy connotation.”\n\nThe first single released from FIELD DAY, “Whenever You’re On My Mind,” is, dodgy or not, just over three minutes of pure Power Pop perfection. Though it was a hit on MTV and reached No. 23 on BILLBOARD’s Rock Tracks Chart, it just missed reaching the BILLBOARD Hot 100, stopping at No. 103.\n\nFor many years, all I knew of Marshall Crenshaw was his film work and the gorgeous “Someday, Someway.”But, a few years back, I found one of his collections and discovered how incredible and brilliant and underappreciated he is, and how this guy should have had a ton of big hits!I honestly don’t know anyone who doesn’t like (or even more accurately, love) Marshall or songs such as “Someday, Someway,” “You’re My Perfect Waste Of Time” or “Whenever You’re On My Mind.”\n\nIf you take anything away from this post, I hope it’s this: whenever someone like Marshall Crenshaw’s on your mind, keep listening long after “Someday, Someway,” because even if they technically are a (real) one-hit wonder, it doesn’t make it right, it doesn’t mean you have to believe it, and you can rejoice in finding such a music treasure.\n\nSome (real) American one-hit wonders are exactly what they are labeled and known for. But others, like World Party, Timbuk 3, The Church, Tom Tom Club, Romeo Void, The Vapors, Bronski Beat, Split Enz and Marshall Crenshaw, absolutely deserve your attention to listen further and go past that one “hit.”\n\n“I never thought I’d be in this situation / It seems wherever I go I’m with you / And though I never seem to find my place / At every turn I see your face / Whenever I think about you / It seems to be a reverie, you’re here with me / ’cause whenever you’re on my mind / Whenever you’re on my mind / I leave the world behind / Whenever you’re on my mind…”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-or2AET9L4\n\nOn June 15, 2014, Casey Kasem, host of the longtime countdown program, AMERICAN TOP 40, passed away at the age of 82. From my first blog post (and prolly some more inbetween then and now), I explained how, in 1979, I was a geeky, lanky and somewhat lost 12-year-old living in Central Maine, had a few friends and not a lot of interest in much of anything, but at some point early that year, I discovered AMERICAN TOP 40, and was glued to it every weekend. Not only could I hear the 40 biggest songs in the country every week, but also Casey’s cool trivia and facts about the songs and the artists, a trait I treasure to this day. For me, the show was No. 1 with a bullet. And still is (thanks to the re-airing of broadcasts of AT40 on iHeart Radio).\n\nIn honor of my radio hero, Casey Kasem, for the entire month of June, I will be highlighting a song each day (some days will have two songs!) that peaked in the Top 40 of the BILLBOARD Hot 100 (including five (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s), and with every blog post, just like on AMERICAN TOP 40, the hits will get bigger with each post. On June 1, 2017, I featured a song that peaked at No. 40. On June 30, I’ll feature a “song of the day” that went all the way to No. 1.\n\nAs Casey used to say on AT40, “And on we go!”\n\nIn 1979, the R&B / Dance band, Nu Shooz, formed in “the other” Portland (Portland, Oregon) by the husband and wife team of John Smith and Valerie Day, originally had 12 members to it. Three years later, they released their first album, CAN’T TURN IT OFF. In 1985, their second album, THA’S RIGHT (containing the original version of “I Can’t Wait”), was released on Poolside Records. (No, I haven’t heard of that label either, but Poolside does come into play in a bigger way a year later.)\n\nBy 1986, Nu Shooz was just John Smith and Valerie Day, and though the original version of “I Can’t Wait” was a big hit in their Portland, OR hometown, no major record labels wanted to sign them. But, a copy of “I Can’t Wait” somehow found its way to The Netherlands, and it was remixed into what became known as the “Dutch Mix.”\n\nWell, once that version found its way back to America, Atlantic Records was interested in Nu Shooz, and John and Valerie were signed to the label in January 1986. Their third album, POOLSIDE (see what they did there), went Gold, and “I Can’t Wait” became a huge global hit.\n\nThe follow-up single to “I Can’t Wait” was “Point Of No Return,” which debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 at No. 97 in early July 1986, exactly two months to the day that POOLSIDE was released. “I Can’t Wait” was still in the Top 30.\n\n“Point Of No Return” (which has no relation to the No. 28 Kansas hit from 1978, and spelled “Point of KNOW Return,” and has no relation to the Exposé Top 5 hit from 1987) made a steady climb up the Hot 100, reaching the Top 40 two months after debuting on the chart, and the same week it spent a week at No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart.\n\nThe stop motion music video (featuring a closetful of sneakers and dancing shoes, which ended up dancing in the video) was directed by Wayne Isham. If that name doesn’t ring a bell, he directed many memorable 80s videos, including the 1986 version of “Pretty In Pink” by The Psychedelic Furs, “You Know I Love You…Don’t You?” by Howard Jones, “Heat Of The Night” by Bryan Adams, “Pour Some Sugar On Me” by Def Leppard, plus many videos by both Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe, including “Home Sweet Home,” which was No. 1 on DIAL MTV for over 90 days in 1987 (though it seemed like much longer, like two years).\n\nSpending a lone week at No. 28 in mid-October 1986, “Point Of No Return” tallied up 22 weeks on the Hot 100, which was an impressive number, considering “I Can’t Wait” was on the chart for 23 weeks, and that reached No. 3.\n\nAround the globe, “Point Of No Return” was a moderate hit, reaching No. 18 in New Zealand, No. 22 in Canada, No. 23 in Switzerland, No. 24 in Germany and No. 48 in the U.K.\n\nNu Shooz released one more album in the 80s (1988’s TOLD U SO), which was not a big success, though it did give the band one more Hot 100 hit – “Should I Say Yes,” which just missed the Top 40, stopping at No. 41.\n\nAfter TOLD U SO, a third album scheduled for release on Atlantic in the early 90s was scrapped. In 2007, Nu Shooz was inducted (with 49 other acts, including Quarterflash, the late, great Elliott Smith, and Paul Revere & The Raiders) into the Oregon Music Hall Of Fame.\n\nThat same year, John Smith and Valerie Day formed a spin-off band with a sound they defined as “Jazz-Pop-Cinema,” and called themselves, naturally, the Nu Shooz Orchestra. As Nu Shooz Orchestra, they released one album in 2010 called PANDORA’S BOX.\n\nIn 2012, Nu Shooz time-traveled back to their 80s style and released the album, KUNG PAO KITCHEN. In 2016, Nu Shooz is now back to at least nine members and back to their roots, and released an album called BAGTOWN. As they say on their website, “Come along with us to a funky soulful place called Bagtown! Fun is the orbit we’re on, and fun is what’s in the bag!” It definitely has funky feel to it. Nice to see them still together and putting out music on their own terms.\n\nI’m sure a lot of folks have forgotten this song (don’t know if they were turned off by the video, which in 2017 looks a bit hokey and dated), but I love this song as much as “I Can’t Wait,” if not a little more…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yavaJNXoMe8\n\nIt’s January 20, 2017 – Inauguration Day here in the U.S. – and just hours away now from the Inauguration of the 45th President of the United States – Donald J. Trump.\n\nI know friends and family members who voted for Trump, looking for change in American politics and a change for America from a non (or not yet) politician, but I just can’t wrap my arms around the whole thing – any of it. I want to have faith and believe that everything will be alright, and that he’ll even surprise me and things will be better than I ever expected, but I’m not there. I can’t even refer to him as President Trump. I just can’t do it.\n\nThere’s too much at risk, too much at stake, too many things to be concerned about, most of all the future of my family and friends. Maybe I’m overreacting, maybe I should just give him a chance, but I’m not there. In the months leading up to the election and since, I’ve also been concerned for free speech, community radio, the LBGTQ community, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, those with insurance losing insurance (though I don’t think people should be penalized for not having it or not wanting it or needing it), an alliance with Russia and potential war with whoever for whatever.\n\nIn Prince’s brilliant 2015 song, “Baltimore,” mostly about the wrongful death of the 25-year-old Black American man, Freddie Gray, Prince sings, “Peace is more than the absence of war,” a quote I believe was lovingly paraphrased from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “Peace is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of justice, of law, of order – in short, of government.”\n\nIt was a change in government and a new president (the 40th U.S. President, inaugurated in 1981, and one of Donald Trump’s heroes, Ronald Reagan) that inspired today’s “song of the day” – “President Gas” by The Psychedelic Furs.\n\n“President Gas” was the opening song off of the P-Furs third studio album, FOREVER NOW (produced by Todd Rundgren). The album was recorded in 1982, and released in September of that year. It was certified Gold here in America.\n\nWritten specifically with Ronald Reagan in mind (“He comes in from the left sometimes / He comes in from the right / It’s so heavily advertised that he wants you and I / It’s a real cowboy set, electric company / Every day is happy days / It’s hell without the sin…”), “President Gas” compliments its smart lyrics with the ballsy use of a cello (courtesy of Ann Sheldon) in a New Wave song.\n\nInteresting how it’s been nearly 35 years after the song’s release, and people are thinking about this song again (because of Donald Trump), almost, if not, exactly in the way The Furs wrote the song about Ronald Reagan.\n\nI had read somewhere on an Interweb chat board about “President Gas” that The Furs’ Richard Butler was “pointing out that everyone who gets to the top in a political system is going to be someone whose only value is his ability to get to the top. Reagan was horrible, but whoever replaced him in 1984 would be horrible too.”\n\nThis was reminiscent (in a way) of this past Presidential election here in America, with two (mostly) unpopular candidates in a very ugly campaign. Hillary Clinton wasn’t my first choice, but I voted for Hillary because (1) I didn’t want Trump in there, and (2) I believed she would take this country in a smart, wonderful direction. More than half of the country thought that too, as she won the popular vote. But, for the second time in five elections, the popular vote was not, well, popular enough…\n\nI’m wishin’ and hopin’ and thinkin’ and prayin’ that everything will be alright for everyone I care about and the country I love during the next four years, and that history (in this case, “President Gas”) doesn’t repeat itself…\n\n“Don’t cry, don’t do anything / No lies, back in the government / No tears, party time is here again / President Gas is up for president…”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WNeYFSdjS8\n\nHappy 2017 everyone! Hope your holiday season treated you well!\n\nFor the January 8, 2017 edition of STUCK IN THE 80s, my little retro radio show on WMPG community radio in Portland, Maine, I’ll be hosting my final (?) All-Request Fest. It’s something I thought of years ago as a way to give back to everyone who tuned in to the show and pledged money on STUCK IN THE 80s during the bi-annual pledge drives. From Pop to Punk, Rap to Rock, New Wave to New Romantics, it’s about the listeners and their requests, and it’s always spontaneous and fun.\n\nFor this final (?) edition of the All-Request Fest, I’ll also be channeling my inner chart nerd and will bring folks 17 for ’17, where I’ll be playing just some of the many songs that peaked at No. 17 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 between 1979 and 1989. So, from now until the All-Request Fest, I’ll be posting all No. 17 hits…just because, well, I AM a chart nerd. And I’m okay with that.\n\nOne of my favorite No. 17 hits on the Hot 100 is courtesy of one of my all-time favorite recording artists – Southampton, England’s wonderful Howard Jones – “You Know I Love You…Don’t You?”\n\nFrom Howard’s third studio album, ONE TO ONE, “You Know I Love You…Don’t You?” was the first single released from the album here in America (in the U.K. and other parts of the globe, “All I Want” was the first single released).\n\nJust four weeks after HoJo’s biggest American hit, “No One Is To Blame,” departed the BILLBOARD Hot 100, he debuted at No. 69 with “You Know I Love You…Don’t You?”\n\nThe creative part-animated, part-live action video (perhaps inspired by the Richard Lowenstein-directed INXS video of “What You Need” earlier that year) was directed by Wayne Isham, who was attending the University of California at Santa Barbara when the video for David Bowie’s “Ashes To Ashes” was released in 1980, and the video inspired him to start making videos.\n\nWhile the majority of the early videos Wayne directed were by Hard Rock and Metal artists like Mötley Crüe, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, Queensrÿche and Megadeth, he also directed videos for folks like The Psychedelic Furs (“Pretty In Pink”), Whitney Houston (“So Emotional”), The Rolling Stones and Roxette. At the MTV Video Music Awards in 1991, Wayne Isham (along with Bon Jovi) received the Lifetime Achievement Award, better known as the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\n\nWith help from the cool music video, “You Know I Love You” debuted on the Top 40 of the Hot 100 in just four weeks. Just before Xmas 1986, it was stuck in a competitive part of the chart, and spent three weeks over the holiday season at No. 17.\n\nWhile “You Know I Love You” was one of HoJo’s biggest hits here in the U.S., it sadly didn’t fare as well elsewhere. In Canada, it reached No. 26, a peak of No. 61 in Australia, and in his U.K. homeland, it stalled at No. 43.\n\nMy oldest friend, Peter, and I got to see HoJo in Portland, Maine in late June 2016. It was my second time seeing HoJo perform (the first time was in 1998 in Boston, on a tour with The Human League and Culture Club). I honestly could see this man perform every day of the week and twice on Sunday. Howard hasn’t had a Top 40 hit in 25 years, but as much as I love singles chart trivia, I also know the Pop charts don’t define recording artists, and definitely doesn’t define HoJo.\n\nOne of the things I love about seeing Howard Jones perform is how comfortable he is in his element. And the things that man can do with a synthesizer! Holy cats! Brilliant, and incredibly fun to watch.\n\nI know I don’t have to ask this question, but Howard, “You Know I Love You…Don’t You?” You bet I do. Hope to see you around these parts again soon…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy3K8tLhQpE\n\nBetween late 1979 and the end of 1989, there were nearly 500 (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s that reached the BILLBOARD Hot 100 just one time, a list that includes Soft Cell, Gary Numan, Timbuk 3, The Church, Bronski Beat, Nik Kershaw, The Buggles, The Waitresses, Ultravox and two different bands named The Silencers. Once a week, I’ll highlight a (real) one-hit wonder for you.\n\nOne of the great movie soundtracks to come out of the 80s was the soundtrack to 1983 film, VALLEY GIRL, starring a young Nicholas Cage in his first lead film role. There was just one problem – despite all of the great music to come out of VALLEY GIRL, like Modern English’s “I Melt With You,” “Johnny Are You Queer?” by Josie Cotton, “Angst In My Pants” by Sparks, “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs and “Who Can It Be Now?” by Men At Work – there was no official soundtrack released.\n\nWell, that changed in 1994 when Rhino Records put together VALLEY GIRL: MUSIC FROM THE SOUNDTRACK, a 15-track CD compilation of songs that appeared in the movie. The soundtrack was so successful, Rhino put out a companion CD in 1995 called VALLEY GIRL: MORE MUSIC FROM THE SOUNDTRACK, which featured songs from Sparks, Thompson Twins, Bananarama, Culture Club, The Jam, “I Eat Cannibals” by Total Coelo, “Mickey” by Toni Basil and much more.\n\nOne of the songs featured in the film and on the first soundtrack was “A Million Miles Away,” a song by a Power Pop / Alt-Rock band formed in Paramount, California (just outside of Los Angeles) called The Plimsouls.\n\nFormed in 1978 by singer / songwriter / guitarist Peter Case, The Plimsouls already had an EP and an album to their credit by 1983, when they released their second full-length album, EVERYWHERE AT ONCE. When VALLEY GIRL was released in late April of that year, several songs from the film ended up being minor hits, prolly most notably, “I Melt With You” by Modern English, which reached No. 78 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in 1983, but has lived on in radio ever since.\n\n“A Million Miles Away” also benefited from its use in VALLEY GIRL, and debuted on the Hot 100 in late July 1983 at No. 88. It reached its No. 82 peak the following week, and its stay on the Hot 100 was short-lived, leaving the chart after just three weeks. They wouldn’t reach the Hot 100 again.\n\nThe Plimsouls broke up shortly after their minor success, and Peter Case has gone on to have a successful solo career, releasing 16 albums and compilations between 1986 and 2015, including one of my favorite album titles of the 80s, THE MAN WITH THE BLUE POST-MODERN FRAGMENTED NEO-TRADITIONALIST GUITAR (or BLUE GUITAR for short; from 1989).\n\nThe band has reunited a number of times since 1995, including a stint featuring Blondie’s Clem Burke. They have also put out three live albums, the latest of which was released in 2012.\n\nBut, it was their 1983 Alt-Rock gem from a small movie with a future big actor and Academy Award winner and a kick-ass soundtrack that has thankfully endured much longer than its Hot 100 chart life, and never seems like a million miles away any time I revisit it…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIxgBMNhsKU\n\nOne of the first things I learned about WMPG community radio in Portland, Maine when I started my little 80s radio program, STUCK IN THE 80s, there in 1996 was the Begathon. WMPG gets approximately 1/3 of its funding from the University of Southern Maine, approximately 1/3 from underwriting, and approximately 1/3 from listener donations. A large chunk of the latter comes from the Begathon. What started out as a 2-week pledge drive in which volunteer radio hosts would “beg” to raise money for the station is now split up into two 1-week pledge drives, one in the Spring and one in the Fall. It’s come a long way since my first Begathon in the Fall of 1996. My very last Begathon for WMPG will be on Sunday, 9.25.2016.\n\nAn artist I love to play any time of the year, Cyndi Lauper, is responsible for a song I love to play any time of the year – especially during Begathon – her 1985 hit, “Money Changes Everything” (from her amazing 1983 debut album, SHE’S SO UNUSUAL).\n\n“Money Changes Everything” was actually a cover of a song first recorded in 1978 by the Atlanta, GA Rock band, The Brains, written by vocalist and keyboardist Tom Gray. Their version led them to a contract with Mercury Records, and they re-recorded “Money Changes Everything” for their 1980 self-titled debut album, produced by the legendary Steve Lillywhite, who also produced albums that year for The Psychedelic Furs (their self-titled debut) and Peter Gabriel (his third self-titled album, also known as MELT, and featuring “Games Without Frontiers” and “Biko.”\n\nSHE’S SO UNUSUAL contained a near-even mix of originals, like “Time After Time” and “She Bop,” and cover songs, including “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” (originally by Robert Hazard), “All Through The Night” (Jules Shear), “When You Were Mine” (a fantastic cover of the Prince original), and “Money Changes Everything.”\n\nReleased in late 1984 as the fifth single from SHE’S SO UNUSUAL, “Money Changes Everything” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 three days before Xmas 1984, the same week Cyndi’s fourth Top 5 single from SHE’S SO UNUSUAL, “All Through The Night” dropped out of the Top 10 (Cyndi was the first female recording artist to have four Top 5 singles from one album, and a debut album at that).\n\n“Money Changes Everything,” which features a solo from friend and “Time After Time” co-writer, Rob Hyman of The Hooters on the Hohner Melodica (otherwise known as a “hooter”), reached the Top 40 of the Hot 100 in just four weeks, but stalled for a week at No. 27 in February 1985, and though it didn’t reach the Top 10, “Money Changes Everything” did help keep Cyndi in the Top 40 every week for 13 consecutive months, ever since “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” debuted in the Top 40 in late January 1984.\n\nAround the globe, “Money Changes Everything” reached No. 14 in New Zealand, No. 19 in Australia and No. 40 in Canada. It was a big hit in South America, reaching No. 3 in Colombia and No. 10 in Chile.\n\nThe official video for “Money Changes Everything” (a link to the video is below) was a live performance piece, where she sported a haircut not many folks could pull off (but she did), she was getting love much love from the audience, and when she wasn’t dancing all over the stage, she was kicking and beating the shit out of this metal garbage can. She eventually she climbed into another garbage can on the stage, and she (and the garbage can) were elevated over the audience. When I saw Cyndi perform in Boston in May 2016 with my dear and talented friend, Hope, it was also nice to see Cyndi still showing love for the song (and the audience too), and it was the last song she performed before her first encore.\n\n“Money Changes Everything” is actually about money and how it interferes with personal relationships. While that’s certainly true in real life, I’ve never looked at the song that way, especially at Begathon time. For a small community radio station like WMPG that, for one week twice a year, asks listeners for help to keep the station running 24/7/365, money from listeners DOES change everything…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp4suZ4jNXg\n\nOne of the first things I learned about WMPG community radio in Portland, Maine when I started my little 80s radio program, STUCK IN THE 80s, there in 1996 was the Begathon. WMPG gets approximately 1/3 of its funding from the University of Southern Maine, approximately 1/3 from underwriting, and approximately 1/3 from listener donations.

It’s come a long way since my first Begathon in the Fall of 1996. My very last Begathon for WMPG will be on Sunday, 9.25.2016.\n\nOne of the most-requested “money” songs around Begathon time on STUCK IN THE 80s is this Psychedelic Furs gem from their 1988 compilation, ALL OF THIS AND NOTHING, which features favorites like “Love My Way,” “Pretty In Pink,” “Heartbreak Beat,” “The Ghost In You,” “Heaven” and “President Gas.” “All That Money Wants’ was recorded specifically for this compilation.\n\n“All That Money Wants” was a huge hit at college radio and was the third song to reach No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s then-new Modern Rock chart (following “Peek-A-Boo” by Siouxsie & The Banshees and “Just Play Music” by Big Audio Dynamite), spending three weeks on top in October 1988.\n\nIn a 2010 AllMusic review by Michael Sutton, he says “All That Money Wants” was “seen as a return to the Furs of old when it was included as a new track on ALL OF THIS OR NOTHING. It’s not. The tune merely combines the dissonance of their first full-length with their stronger melodic sensibilities in the mid-‘80s.”\n\nWell, I agree with part of that review, though I don’t know if I’d refer to “All That Money Wants” as “merely” anything, but, what I do know is that it is one the songs my listeners want around this time of year, for whatever meaning it has for them, if anything. Money doesn’t actually have to be involved, but for those folks who can afford to pledge to WMPG this time of year, “All That Money Wants” could turn into “All That ‘MPG Wants,” which is to get enough funding to keep on keepin’ on for another six months…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gti22zo6sm0\n\nWhat do you do when one of your favorite bands splits up and goes their separate ways? Well, in the case of Talking Heads, you keep listening to the music you fell in love with, enjoy the solo projects they all have, and keep wishin’ and hopin’ and thinkin’ and prayin’ that they’ll get back together for a reunion tour (or just watch STOP MAKING SENSE again).\n\nIn the case of The Police, you keep listening to the music you fell in love with, enjoy the solo projects they all have, and see them on their 2007 reunion tour (like I did), because it’ll prolly never happen again.\n\nAnd, in the case of Duran Duran in 1985 – one of the first bands that meant a lot to me during the early 80s – you keep hoping they’ll get back together in some form and keep listening to the music you fell in love with. Duran Duran actually made it easy. After their 1983 album, SEVEN AND THE RAGGED TIGER, the band went on a “planned” hiatus, splitting into two side projects, but not without giving us the live ARENA album and their second No. 1 song, “A View To A Kill,” from the James Bond film of the same name.\n\nFrontman and lead singer Simon LeBon, keyboardist Nick Rhodes and drummer Roger Taylor went on to form Arcadia, which was reminiscent of their work with Duran Duran. Bassist John Taylor and guitarist Andy Taylor went a different route with their band, what would become the “supergroup” The Power Station.\n\nThe Power Station had an edgier Rock / Funk sound that John and Andy Taylor weren’t able to pull off with Duran Duran. In 1984, Bebe Buell, singer and former model, part-time Portlander and the biological mother to actress Liv Tyler, was dating John Taylor, and she wanted to do a cover of T. Rex’s 1972 classic, “Get It On (Bang A Gong).” John proceeded to get some of his famous music friends together to help out, and instead, it turned into something more.\n\nJohn and Andy reached out to their idols from the 70s Dance/Soul band, Chic. The amazing Tony Thompson was on board as the drummer, and Bernard Edwards would be the producer. Now, they needed a singer. John and Andy approached folks like Billy Idol, Mick Jagger, Richard Butler of The Psychedelic Furs and Mick Ronson, who had worked with David Bowie and Morrissey.\n\nOriginally the band was to be called Big Brother, and the initial idea was to have a revolving door of lead singers, each one singing on a different track on the album. English singer / songwriter Robert Palmer – who had released several albums since 1975, but with limited success around the globe – had performed live with Duran Duran once in 1983, and was the invited vocalist for the song, “Communication.” Robert had heard they were doing a cover of “Get It On” and wanted to try out for it, and instead, the band ended up doing the whole album with Robert Palmer.\n\nThe entire band – Robert Palmer on vocals, John Taylor on bass, Andy Taylor on guitar, and Tony Thompson on those amazing drums – appeared on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE on February 16, 1985, and were introduced to the world. And from there, The Power Station was a hit, as was their self-titled album, which was certified Gold in the U.K. and reached the Top 10 on the BILLBOARD album chart.\n\nThe “supergroup” also had three Top 40 singles on the BILLBOARD Hot 100, “Some Like It Hot” (No. 6 for 2 weeks, May 1985), their cover of “Get It On (Bang A Gong)” (No. 9 for 2 weeks, August 1985, surpassing the No. 10 peak of the T. Rex original) and “Communication” (No. 34 for 2 weeks, October 1985). (“Get It On” also reached No. 22 in the U.K., and No. 8 in Australia.)\n\nFor those keeping score, The Power Station did fare better overall than the other equally short-lived Duran Duran side project, Arcadia, whose album, SO RED THE ROSE, was certified Platinum here in the U.S., and they had a couple of Top 40 singles – “Election Day” (No. 6, 1985) and “Goodbye Is Forever” (No. 33), as well as a MTV video hit with “The Flame.”\n\nBy the end of 1985, The Power Station was no more. But, the experience breathed new life and then some into Robert Palmer’s career. Before the year was out, his eighth studio album, RIPTIDE, was released (recruiting fellow Power Stationers Bernard Edwards as producer, Andy Taylor on guitar, and Tony Thompson on drums). It was the biggest album of Robert Palmer’s career. Remember those memorable drums and that guitar solo on his No. 1 hit, “Addicted To Love?” – it was courtesy of Tony and Andy.\n\nTony Thompson went on to provide drum support for some acts, and appeared in a few bands, along with the brief return of Chic in 1992. John Taylor opted to return to Duran Duran, while Andy Taylor did not return in lieu of a solo career. Both John and Andy had separate Top 30 singles on the Hot 100 in 1986, and both were movie songs. Andy Taylor could also be found on other hit singles in the second half of the 80s, providing his guitar talents for several artists, notably on Belinda Carlisle’s “Mad About You” (1986) and “Lost In You” and “Forever Young,” from Rod Stewart’s 1989 album, OUT OF ORDER.\n\nThey would all get back together in 1996 for their second album, LIVING IN FEAR, though John Taylor had to drop out of the project and wasn’t on the record. Bernard Edwards was all set to tour with The Power Station, but tragically died during a trip to Japan. Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson both sadly passed away in 2003, within a couple months of each other. Robert had just released a Blues album.\n\nToday, Duran Duran is touring in support of their fourteenth studio album, the wonderful PAPER GODS (Andy Taylor did rejoin the band for their 2004 album, ASTRONAUT, but it was not to be, and the other band members have continued on without him). With my dear friend Shawn, we saw Duran Duran (with Chic opening) in Brooklyn back in April 2016. Both bands were brilliant, and both paid tribute to David Bowie. It is one of THE best shows I’ve ever seen in my life.\n\nAnd “Get It On (Bang A Gong)” is one of THE best covers I’ve ever heard. You can hear John Taylor’s impressive, funky bass work; Andy Taylor’s killer guitar; the booming drums courtesy of Tony Thompson; and, the memorable, passionate vocals of Robert Palmer. One of the things I loved most about The Power Station – and you can especially hear it on this song – is that every member of the “supergroup” is represented, and they never let you forget that…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2vHbXI2p4k\n\nA number of great bands have hailed from Liverpool, England, like Echo & The Bunnymen, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, A Flock Of Seagulls, Icicle Works, It’s Immaterial, The Boo Radleys, The Lightning Seeds, Ladytron, Gerry And The Pacemakers, and a 4-man band that you might have heard of before, The Beatles.\n\nAnother great band to come out of Liverpool was the Alt-Rock band, The La’s, led by a couple of singer / songwriter / guitarists, Lee Mavers and band founder Mike Badger. The La’s had been around since 1983 but it wasn’t until 1987 when the band released their first single, “Way Out.” It caught Morrissey’s ear, but didn’t catch many other ears overall, stopping at No. 86 on the U.K. singles chart.\n\nThe follow-up single to “Way Out” was a song called “There She Goes,” released on Halloween 1988, and whose title came out of a 1967 Velvet Underground song, “There She Goes Again.” It charted better than their first single, but stalled at No. 59 on the U.K. singles chart. A little more than a year later, the band recorded their debut album with famed producer Steve Lillywhite, who had worked with U2, Simple Minds, Talking Heads, Big Country, The Psychedelic Furs, Peter Gabriel, XTC, The Pogues, Siouxsie & The Banshees and Joan Armatrading, among others.\n\nThis was an album that had been recorded and re-recorded over a 2-year period, and their self-titled album was finally released in the U.K. in October 1990, the rest of Europe a month later, and here in the U.S. in 1991.\n\nThe album did well in the U.K., reaching No. 30 on the album chart there and was certified Silver. However, away from the U.K., the album didn’t do well, and has sold less than 50,000 copies in the U.S., stopping at No. 196 on the BILLBOARD Top 200 album chart. It would be the only studio album The La’s ever released.\n\nThe release of THE LA’s album did spark renewed interest in “There She Goes,” and the re-release of the single sent the song to a No. 13 peak in the U.K., while over here in the U.S., it spent 2 weeks at No. 49 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in August / September 1991 and reached No. 2 on BILLBOARD’s Modern Rock chart.\n\n“There She Goes” has been covered a number of times, most notably by The Boo Radleys (both their version and The La’s original were featured on the soundtrack to the 1993 Mike Meyers film, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER, and a poopy crap version that fared a little better than the original, by Sixpence None The Richer, in 1999.\n\nThe La’s had quite the rotating lineup between 1983 and 1992, when they pretty much split up, though occasionally reuniting for concerts throughout the 90s and post-Y2K. Over the years, “There She Goes” has been featured in several films and TV shows, and respect for the band and their lone American hit has increased.\n\nIn 2007, the U.K. magazine NME (New Musical Express) ranked the song at No. 45 on its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. Personally, I rank this simple, short gem among my all-time favorites, from the 80s, 90s, and then some…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX9TDQcCyVE"
