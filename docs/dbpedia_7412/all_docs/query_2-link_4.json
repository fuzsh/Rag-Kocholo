        "text": "Tommy Heath and Jim Keller were the heart and soul of Tommy Tutone. Heath sang and played guitar and piano while Keller's duties included some singing and lead guitar. They worked with bassist Jon Lyons, who was later replaced by Greg Sutton and drummer Victor Carberry, who was replaced by Jerry Angel. Steve LeGassick joined in 1983, playing keyboards and synthesizer.\n\nHeath and Keller first got together in 1978.... After working up some songs together, the duo was signed to Columbia Records, debuting in the spring of 1980 with \"Tommy Tutone\" (Columbia 36372)....\n\nAfter taking more than a year to write and record new songs, Keller and Heath were back in business with a new album, \"Tommy Tutone - 2\" (Columbia 37401), that would prove to be their breakthrough record. Issued in late 1981, the album's first single would be their biggest hit....\n\n[\"867-5309/Jenny\"] caught on immedidately with radio programmers and it charted on Billboard in January 1982, peaking in the Top 5. It was certified gold, for sales of more than 1 million copies....\n\nWith a Top 10 hit to their credit, it wasn't a surprise that Tommy Tutone's album also did well, peaking at No. 20 in the spring of '82....\n\n\"National Emotion\" (Columbia 38425) was their third album. Issued in the fall of 1983, it did chart for a few weeks on the album lists but none of the singles from the release were successful.\n\nWith the minimal success of their third album seeming to be an indication of their future, Heath and Keller decided to call it quits."
