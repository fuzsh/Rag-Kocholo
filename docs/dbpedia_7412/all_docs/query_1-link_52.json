Both styles of uniforms were made well, though not totally accurate to the 1964 originals. The powder blue White Sox jerseys had a CHICAGO front at lease an inch taller than the original flannel did. Meanwhile, the Reds vests…well, on the good side, they replicated the originals’ NOB under the number, a first in pro sports at that time. Not so good: those NOBs were in a smaller, wider font than the originals. Still, a good uniform overall with a nice added touch: the Civil Rights Game patch on the back of the neck, where the MLB logo is normally found. I wonder if the MLB website or the individual teams will get the nod o market these? In the past, most Chisox TBTCs were sold at the next Sox Fan Fest.\n\nOn Fathers’ Day, the AAA Syracuse Chiefs promoted prostate cancer awareness by wearing white caps with a light blue logo on the front, and a blue ribbon on the back. Check www.syracusechiefs.com for availability of game-worn or other versions.\n\nFinally, for those keeping track, the one game in which Manny Ramirez played for the Albuquerque Isotopes before his return from suspension found him in an Isotopes home white #99 jersey.\n\nMORE JERSEY JAMMIN’\n\nTag carryovers happen, but rarely this extreme: Eric Atkinson noticed a common player Red Sox road knit up for auction that was tagged for 2000. Provenance was fine, as it came from Kruk Cards, normally not a game-used dealer but an entity that did obtain a sizeable number of Red Sox gamers at last winter’s Fenway Park Garage Sale. This 2000 Bosox piece carried a Russell manufacturers’ tag…the style used in 1992!\n\nJust curious…what will happen to the Lakers Game 2 NBA Finals uniforms? The Game 1 apparel (Lakers gold, Magic blue) as well as the Game 3 outfits (Magic white, Lakers purple) were tagged and recorded by MeiGray were sold through NBA Auctions. Game 2, though, found the Lakers wearing the Sunday home whites for the only time in the 5-game series. Where will these end up? Will MeiGray obtain these, as well? Will the Lakers auction/sell them on the team website? Will Lakers expert and dealer Dan Cisneros acquire them? Someone else? I guess we’ll have to stay tuned.\n\nDID YOU KNOW…, That, while the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB have made league anniversary patches pretty much and all-for-one concept in terms of uniform display, be it a patch (MLB 125th Anniversary, for example) or a special uniform feature (gold Jerry Wet logo for the NBA’s 50th Anniversary), one defunct league only found a single team wearing its anniversary logo? Yep, the American Football League celebrated 10 years of life in its final year before the NFL-AFL merger. The only team wearing the 10-year AFL patch was the Kansas City Chiefs, and only on their Super Bowl 4 unies, which were the home reds.\n\nThe bulletin board on MEARS posted the news of the game-used sale of Red Wings NHL gear this past Saturday in Troy, Michigan.

He began the 1971 season with the St. Louis Cardinals, but was dealt to Milwaukee during the season. Being a little guy, it was amusing to see a ’71 Brewers home flannel of his owned, at the time, by Brewers collector and Miller Park program seller Rich Lulloff. The jersey had Cardenal’s #1 added to the back, but did not have a number change…the jersey was originally a size 38 Bat Boy jersey, which was blank-backed. How often does a batboy shirt end up being used by a Major League veteran?\n\nSpeaking of Brewers, a first I saw on eBay recently was a Majestic gamer using a pre-2000 Majestic BP jersey tag. The jersey was an alternate worn by Milwaukee benchwarmer Jason Conti, and had normal and complete 2003 strip tagging in the collar. The oddity was the tail-located 1998-99 Majestic label as found on BP attire. That was the first time I saw a carryover of a BP jersey Majestic label onto a game Majestic jersey.\n\nFinally, I didn’t try to photo match this item, so I can’t verify it as game-worn, but a seeming oddity on the piece was verified with a photo in the eBay listing that at least created a style-match. The jersey was a Reebok 2004 Chargers powder blue Ladanian Tomlinson top. The oddity on this item (although I’ve also seen it on a small number of Reebok issued Throwback styles in 2001-03) was the lack of an NFL neck logo on the LT jersey. The eBay-listed jersey was sans logo, and so was the jersey LT wore in the photo. Like I said, without hands-on inspection and access to the MEARS Database, I can’t positively peg it as a game-used jersey…but the lack of neck logos on both shirt and game photo means that I can’t automatically dismiss it, either…at least until I could perform more research.\n\nNBA FINALS JERSEY BREAKDOWN\n\nThe 2009 NBA Finals found the Orlando Magic wearing only their basic home and road uniforms in all 5 games. The Lakers, meanwhile, wore their purple road threads for all three Orlando-based games, but split the styles in Games 1 and 2 at the Staples Center, wearing the standard gold home unies for the first game, and the Sunday home alternate white outfits for the second game.\n\nJERSEY ODDITIES THAT ARE NOT LEGIT\n\nI also saw a pair of jerseys on The Bay that were lacking in authenticity for visible reasons.\n\nFor starters, a 1973 Brewers road knit of Jerry Bell was offered, with a slightly errant numeric font on the front, and a very errant font on the team nickname on the front. “BREWERS” was affixed in serif bearing letters, whereas the BREWERS front on both home and road knits of the era are sans-serif. This poorly-done counterfeit may well have been a 1970s/early 1980s creation, put together in an era where certain teams were very tough to find jerseys of in the hobby (and back then, the Brewers were among them), and even a common could be a $200 or more sale when found. Research sources were nothing like they are in 2009, and a rather uneducated hobby market of 30 or so years ago may have accepted this fake, obvious in 2009, as genuine back then.\n\nAnother jersey that isn’t what it ought to be seen on eBay recently was a 2001 Rams home jersey of Orlando pace. The jersey had proper collar and tail tagging for a 2001 Reebok jersey, as well as the correct NFL neck logo, but still had one noticeable flaw…the numbers were your basic serifed block numbers, last used by the Rams in 2000. In 2001, the team went to a more stylized numeric font, which this Pace piece should have had, but didn’t.\n\nWhile we’re at it, another “game used” piece advertised on the Bay was a road Indiana State Larry Bird shirt. The jersey was made by Starter, a company that, as far as I know, didn’t make jerseys for anybody in the late 1970s. A cheesy looking name/year tag accompanied the Starter label, leading me to believe it was a retail item.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nDusty Rhodes, a hero for the underdog New York Giants in their 1954 World Series upset of the Cleveland Indians, died June 17 at age 82. Rhodes hit 2 home runs in that 4-game sweep, both off Hall of Famers (Bob Lemon and Early Wynn). He played for the Giants in New York from 1954-57, and for them in San Francisco in 1959.\n\nJack Littrell, a 1950s infielder, died at age 80 on June 9. Littrell played for the Philadelphia A’s in 1952, the Kansas City A’s in 1954-55, and the Cubs in 1957.\n\nRay Hamrick, a wartime MLBer, died at age 87, also on June 9. He played at both middle infield positions for the Phillies in 1943-44.\n\nWoodie Held, a shortstop-outfielder who played in the Show in 1954 and from 1957-69, died June 11. he was 77. Held’s entire career in the Majors was in the American league, where he played for 7 of the 10 teams in the circuit before the 1969 expansion. Seven of those seasons were in Cleveland Indians flannels, and he also served as a back-up on the World Champion Orioles in 1966. Held also had stops with the Yankees, Kansas City A’s, (expansion) Senators, Angels and White Sox.\n\nHal Woodeshick, a southpaw pitcher who played in the Bigs in 1956 and also from 1958-67, died June 14th at age 76. He was on the first rosters of two different expansion teams (1961 Senators and 1962 Colt .45s), and finished his MLB career in grand style, earning a World Series ring with the 1967 World Champion Cardinals.\n\nFinally, Frank Dasso, a pitcher with the 1945-46 Reds, died on June 8. He was 91.\n\nSAM-ME: YOU REALLY DIDN’T SURPRISE ME\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Miedema\n\nMORE LEGIT JERSEY ODDITIES\n\nRecent viewings on eBay and a trip on Mr. Peabody’s Wayback Machine have led me to some more unusual jerseys that are, or may, be the real deal after all.\n\nJose Cardenal was a diminutive fellow who played for roughly 17 years in the Majors.

Two such examples will be detailed here.\n\nThe 1971 Dodgers issued #36 to an infielder, Marv Galiher, who never made the Majors, in 1971 or otherwise. After the 1971 season, the Dodgers worked a trade with Baltimore that landed them one Frank Robinson. Robby was not able to wear his standard #20, as Don Sutton had it and wouldn’t part with it. As a result, Robinson wore #36 in 1972, and, with the team still wearing flannels in spring training…yep, Robinson was given Galiher’s unies to wear. Topps card #754 from the 1972 set carries a picture of Frank in Galiher’s #36 1971 flannel.\n\nTurn the clock forward to 1981, and the Mariners saw a field staff change during the season. Manager Maury Wills, #30, was fired in mid-season, and when Rene Lachemann took over, his coaching staff included Vada Pinson, like Wills, a MLB star in the 1960s, and, like Wills, the wearer of at least one of the same 1981 jerseys. I recall a Chicago show a few years ago, in which a Wilson gamer, tagged “30 81” in the tail, bore Pinson’s NOB and his #28 both front and back, one jersey worn by two stars post-career.\n\nICE AND HOOPS AUCTION ACTION\n\nBoth the NHL and NBA websites have some good stuff up for auction at this time. The NBA auction site at www.nba.com has the jerseys worn in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, both Lakers home and Magic road. At last look, Kobe’s yellow #24 shirt was already over $10,000. Bids will be taken until 8PM CST on June 18.\n\nOver at www.nhl.com, the run of alternate blue jerseys with tie front necks worn by the St. Louis Blues are up for bids, with closing time on the 15th at 7PM CST. For both the Blues sweaters and the NBA Finals gamers, MeiGray tagging and database entry are part of the package.\n\nMORE WNBA MADNESS\n\nThe Life Lock…er, Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA are being joined by the Los Angeles Sparks in going corporate with their uniforms. The Sparks predominant jersey front logo will not longer be the city or team name, but instead will be the Farmers Insurance Group logo. Ugh!\n\nNICE TRY\n\nAlthough the seller may well not be the original source of this lacking item, an eBay listing of recent days had what was described as a 2001 Expos home knit of Vladimir Guerrero. The Russell Expos jerseys of the early 2000’s do not carry year tags, and the jersey does have team-issued flag tags underneath the Russell label, but there is still a noticeable problem with this piece. The Russell tag shows the slanted “R” in the Russell name, the current logo for the supplier which first saw tags in 2004. Guerrero last wore an Expos uniform in 2003. Nice-looking, to be sure, but not what it ought to be.\n\nTURN BACK THE CLOCK…100 YEARS\n\nToday (Sunday) the Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Tigers will wear retro 1909 uniforms during their interleague game. The Bucs and Tigers were opponents in the 1909 World Series, with Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner big names in the action.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nJim Owens, longtime football coach at the University of Washington, died last week at age 82. Owens coached the Huskies from 1957-74, leading them to three Rose Bowl berths. He played in 8 NFL games with the Baltimore Colts in 1950.\n\nPio Sagapolutele, a 7-year NFL veteran who was a starter in Super Bowl XXXI, died of an aneurysm at age 39. He played from 1991-97, with his first 5 years wearing the original Cleveland Browns uniform, 1996 with New England, and his final season in 1997 was as a Saint.\n\nZEN MASTER: MAKE IT 10 AND PASS RED!\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Miedema\n\nFOUR PLAYERS, TWO JERSEYS\n\nRecycling jerseys for spring training and even the regular season was far more common in the 1970s and 1980s than today.

While the jerseys worn by the Wrigleys in 1985 carry the 85 year notation in the collar strip tag and tail box tag, such is also the case for their 1984 NLCS attire. The Cubs were intending to wear their 1984 postseason garb as their standard ’85 duds, but the gut-wrenching loss to the Padres in the NLCS (up 2-0 only to lose the next three and the series) caused the team to discard these sets.\n\nHow does one tell and 85 tagged 1985 regular season shirt from an 85 tagged 1984 playoff wearable? The key is the right sleeve of the jersey. The 1984 playoff team wore a large round patch proclaiming themselves as 1984 NL East Champs. The patches were removed, but the round imprint is still there on these postseason threads. No imprint, and you’ve got yourself a 1985 regular season item.\n\nPRE-1987 RAWLINGS LOGO\n\nA recent auction allowed me to learn something about Rawlings advertising logos on MLB game uniforms. While the 1987 contract was the first widespread use of the manufacturer name on the jersey sleeve, there was at least one occasion upon which a Rawlings emblem was worn on an MLB uniform before that. In this case, it was the 1978 Reds Tour of Japan uniforms. While the grey roads during the season were Wilson products, the Reds went to Rawlings for the traveling grays worn in the postseason Japanese exhibition tour. On the pants, a red circle with a white script upper case R is featured on the left rear side of the pants, near the pocket.

The head-scratcher is an apparently recycled pre-1966 Cardinals flannel issued to newcomer Joe Torre for at least the 1969 Grapefruit League season, and possibly the regular season as well. The tipoff: Pre-1966 Cardinals shirts depicted the Birds-On-Bat logo with the left (to the viewer) bird having his tail located behind the bat, while the bird seated on the right has his tail in front of the bat. The two sides were flip-flopped into an opposite arrangement after 1965. Photos of Torre in this at least 4-year-old flannel can be seen on a popular MLB licensed 8×10 color photo of Joe, as well as a team photo used as a yearbook picture. I wouldn’t have expected the Cardinals to go that route to supply a star like Torre, and Jeff was surprised, as well.\n\nMy other tale is a case of a legitimate common jersey repeatedly offered by its owners as a minor star’s gamer. The item is a 1971 White Sox flannel with the name “Moloney” chain-stitched onto a collar strip tag. Problem is, several previous owners have been deluded into believing the owner was former Reds ace Jim Maloney. Maloney spent 1971 with the Angels, and never pitched for the White Sox.\n\nAs it turns out, the #48 jersey in question was made for, but not worn by, pitcher Dick Moloney, whose MLB career consisted of one appearance for the 1970 Chisox. He had jerseys made for 1971 usage, but was cut, and #48 was re-issued to Rick Reichardt, who may or may not have worn these. I make the use factor a “maybe” based on both Moloney and Reichardt being 6-foot-3, but Reichardt being 30 pounds heavier (215 to Moloney’s 185).

What is to follow is a recap of some of the uniform oddities that the team trotted out on the backs of it’s on-field personnel in the ’60’s.\n\nUniform recycling: The team was notorious for both major and minor league recycling of its 1960s flannels. Finding a pre-1969 Sox jersey, home or road, with original NOB is a major challenge. Also of note is the 1967-68 era, in which many 1967 road powder blues (by MacGregor) were recycled for 1968 with the addition of the Illinois Sesquicentennial patch that both the Sox and Cubs wore that year. One notable such jersey I have seen is the road blue of Ken Boyer, a former NL MVP who was playing out the string by then. He spent part of a season with the Chisox in 1967 after coming from the Mets, and spent an even shorter stint with the Pale Hose in 1968 before going to the Dodgers. The 1968 road flannel Boyer wore was a 1967-issued item.\n\nExtreme Uniform Recycling: Then, there’s the case of longtime AL slugger Rocky Colavito. While the title of a written piece suggested “Don’t Knock the Rock”, that is exactly what the White Sox did upon his arrival in 1967, in terms of providing a jersey for a player of his magnitude.\n\nThe Sox grabbed a road flannel (this example I have seen) with a name and number change, and issued it to Rocky. Even more low-ticket was the fact that it was a 1966 flannel, meaning that the team also had to change the front of the jersey, from the arched dark blue CHICAGO to the 1967-68 style Chicago script, with the slash underneath bearing the team name WHITE SOX in white. How many dollars did they save doing this? I don’t know, but it’s insulting to give a major star a regular season jersey this refurbished…at least to me.\n\nAnother odd recycling didn’t involve a name/number/front change, but a TAG change! Don Gutteridge served as a coach under manager Al Lopez throughout 1965. The next season found Eddie Stanky taking over for The Senor, and Gutteridge was not returned. In mid-1968, however, with the Sox floundering after nearly winning the 1967 AL pennant, Stanky was shown the door, and Lopez returned, bringing Gutteridge back with him. The Sox broke out a home jersey of Don’s from 1965, and proceeded to change the year tag to reflect the year (1968). The patch for Illinois was added, and voila…you have a jersey Gutteridge wore three years earlier all set to be re-used, with a few adjustments. This tale comes from the 1990s newsletter Diamond Duds.\n\nOverall, the Sox continued the low budget approach for uniforms until the Reinsdorf/Einhorn tandem took over calling the shots in 1981…but even they had a uniform supply problem their first season in charge…that will be saved for next time.\n\nDOWN ON THE FARM\n\nThe Salt Lake Bees trotted out pink breast cancer awareness jerseys a week ago. No word as to how these jerseys will be released as of yet.\n\nAlso, Carlos Zambrano, rotation ace of the Chicago Cubs, had a rehab start last Monday on the road.

That was his only game action in his Advanced Class A rehab.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nBill Kelso, a pitcher who spent three seasons with the Angels, died May 11 at age 69.

Humphrey after a galling Sox loss in Minnesota:\n\n“Who cares? He can’t hit!”.\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Miedema\n\nMORE ONE AND DONES\n\nThis time out, I’ll start with a pair of one-year jersey styles to discuss, and add a pair of one-year cap designs, also.\n\n1968 Oakland A’s: For a one-year style, a nice quantity of these reside within the hobby, although many are in private collections, not being moved at this time. McAuliffe made all three vest styles, which included the city name in chenille print, on jerseys colored white, golden yellow, and mist green. The jerseys first appeared en masse in the 1980s, when the team released the majority of them to a registered pharmacist/collector who has business ties to most of the Phoenix-area based spring training camps. Among the highlights of what this group contained were Reggie Jackson rookie flannels and the first jerseys worn by Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio (#5) in his two year stint as an Oakland coach.\n\n1987 New York Mets road: In the first year of the Rawlings uniform contract, the Mets, a Rawlings user most of the previous 15 years, wore an attractive grey road jersey with a scripted New York, as opposed to the standard block-letter city name, across the front. The scripted New York was also used on that year’s road blue mesh BP jerseys as well, one of which was recently offered by an honest, but lousy researcher/dealer as a 1994 item. They’re out there, but with many Mets style collectors, bidding is usually spirited, especially on the game versions, when they are offered.\n\n1957 Cubs cap: Wilson was responsible for these, a cap similar to the solid blue design the team has worn since 1958, but with red/white pinstripes going from top to bottom on the crown seams. Originals are extremely rare. For a nice look at one, check out the 1958 Topps card of Ernie Banks, #310.\n\n1976 White Sox road cap: I don’t recall if KM Pro or New Era (or both) made these, but this style, thanks to some managerial griping, only lasted for several weeks in 1976. The caps had the navy brim like the normal home version, but the crowns were white with a navy horizontal SOX on the front. Several 1977 Topps cards have pictures of these short-lived lids. Their swan song came when a game against the Yankees found Yanks skipper Billy Martin protesting to the umpires about the caps and the white sleeves of the undershirts that went with the road uniform. Martin’s gripe was that the plethora of white made it too difficult for his batters to see the pitched baseball. Very quickly, both the hats and the undershirts were yanked, replaced with all navy examples of each.\n\nMONITORING THE MINORS\n\nSome minor league uniform specials worn over the last month or so include the following:\n\nStockton Ports (California League): 1950’s style TBTC uniforms were worn on April 18.\n\nFresno Grizzlies (Pacific Coast League): Another medical cause was publicized by the Grizzlies on April 24, when Autism Awareness unies were trotted out.\n\nAltoona Curve (Eastern League): May 3 found the curve sporting throwbacks designed after the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates, back in an era when the city name was spelled PITTSBURG.\n\nNOTES FROM THE SHOW\n\nThe Mariners and Athletics decided to pay tribute to the old Pacific Coast League by wearing TBTC attire of the 1939 Seattle Rainiers and Oakland Oaks, from back in the pre-MLB days of both cities.\n\nAlso, the publicized Washington NATINALS error jerseys worn for part of one game by a few Nationals players on April 17 found the home white worn by Adam Dunn being auctioned on May 2 at the Nats’ 4th Annual Dream Gala. Final bid on this oddity: $8,000.\n\nSTOLEN BLING\n\nReggie McKenzie, employed by the Green Bay Packers, had a briefcase stolen from his car a couple of weeks ago. The contents of the briefcase included his Super Bowl XXXI ring and a Packers NFC Championship ring. If you are offered these, they are hot…don’t buy ’em, but contact the Packers about it.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nFormer AFL QB and former Republican VP candidate Jack Kemp died from a long illness at age 73. He was a quarterback in the old AFL from 1960-69 with the Los Angeles Chargers and the Buffalo Bills, and was the man running the offense of the Bills’ two AFL title teams in 1964-65.\n\nIT’S TIME, BLACKHAWKS…DEFEAT THE DEAD WINGS!!\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Miedema\n\nMORE ONE AND DONES\n\nThis time out, I’ll start with a pair of one-year jersey styles to discuss, and add a pair of one-year cap designs, also.\n\n1968 Oakland A’s: For a one-year style, a nice quantity of these reside within the hobby, although many are in private collections, not being moved at this time. McAuliffe made all three vest styles, which included the city name in chenille print, on jerseys colored white, golden yellow, and mist green. The jerseys first appeared en masse in the 1980s, when the team released the majority of them to a registered pharmacist/collector who has business ties to most of the Phoenix-area based spring training camps. Among the highlights of what this group contained were Reggie Jackson rookie flannels and the first jerseys worn by Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio (#5) in his two year stint as an Oakland coach.\n\n1987 New York Mets road: In the first year of the Rawlings uniform contract, the Mets, a Rawlings user most of the previous 15 years, wore an attractive grey road jersey with a scripted New York, as opposed to the standard block-letter city name, across the front. The scripted New York was also used on that year’s road blue mesh BP jerseys as well, one of which was recently offered by an honest, but lousy researcher/dealer as a 1994 item. They’re out there, but with many Mets style collectors, bidding is usually spirited, especially on the game versions, when they are offered.\n\n1957 Cubs cap: Wilson was responsible for these, a cap similar to the solid blue design the team has worn since 1958, but with red/white pinstripes going from top to bottom on the crown seams. Originals are extremely rare. For a nice look at one, check out the 1958 Topps card of Ernie Banks, #310.\n\n1976 White Sox road cap: I don’t recall if KM Pro or New Era (or both) made these, but this style, thanks to some managerial griping, only lasted for several weeks in 1976. The caps had the navy brim like the normal home version, but the crowns were white with a navy horizontal SOX on the front. Several 1977 Topps cards have pictures of these short-lived lids. Their swan song came when a game against the Yankees found Yanks skipper Billy Martin protesting to the umpires about the caps and the white sleeves of the undershirts that went with the road uniform. Martin’s gripe was that the plethora of white made it too difficult for his batters to see the pitched baseball. Very quickly, both the hats and the undershirts were yanked, replaced with all navy examples of each.\n\nMONITORING THE MINORS\n\nSome minor league uniform specials worn over the last month or so include the following:\n\nStockton Ports (California League): 1950’s style TBTC uniforms were worn on April 18.\n\nFresno Grizzlies (Pacific Coast League): Another medical cause was publicized by the Grizzlies on April 24, when Autism Awareness unies were trotted out.\n\nAltoona Curve (Eastern League): May 3 found the curve sporting throwbacks designed after the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates, back in an era when the city name was spelled PITTSBURG.\n\nNOTES FROM THE SHOW\n\nThe Mariners and Athletics decided to pay tribute to the old Pacific Coast League by wearing TBTC attire of the 1939 Seattle Rainiers and Oakland Oaks, from back in the pre-MLB days of both cities.\n\nAlso, the publicized Washington NATINALS error jerseys worn for part of one game by a few Nationals players on April 17 found the home white worn by Adam Dunn being auctioned on May 2 at the Nats’ 4th Annual Dream Gala. Final bid on this oddity: $8,000.\n\nSTOLEN BLING\n\nReggie McKenzie, employed by the Green Bay Packers, had a briefcase stolen from his car a couple of weeks ago. The contents of the briefcase included his Super Bowl XXXI ring and a Packers NFC Championship ring. If you are offered these, they are hot…don’t buy ’em, but contact the Packers about it.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nFormer AFL QB and former Republican VP candidate Jack Kemp died from a long illness at age 73.

I hope you don’t mind me pinch hitting for Dave this week. When trying to decide what to get out, I thought I would use this as something to force me to look some issues or questions I have had for some time. They focus on model numbers for Hillerich & Bradsby Bats.\n\nBats are dated by any number of characteristics such as various styles and formats of information branded on them. They are also dated to a more narrow range based on combination length, weight and model number. It is this latest aspect that I would like to devote some time to with respect to Hillerich and Bradsby offerings.\n\nBefore going any further, think about the purpose and function of a model number from a manufacturer’s perspective:\n\n1. It allows the manufacturer to track the various products into a manageable number of items that may be common to or requested by multiple players. If It’s found that a number of players are using the same model bat, then only one or few of these need to remain on hand in order to support duplication.\n\n2. It facilitates and simplifies production as relates to pulling a bat as an exemplar for turning.\n\n3. It facilities inventory control and the processing of an order, especially in the case when a player may order more than one model at the same time.\n\nFrom the perspective of the end user:\n\n1. It facilities the ability to cross check what was received vs what was ordered.\n\n2. It facilitates product identification when selecting a bat for use.\n\n3. It facilitates either product reordering, or requests for new bats in the form of requesting a new model made from say an S2 knob, K55 handle and an R43 barrel.\n\nThe question I have and am looking at is when did model numbers begin to appear on the knobs of Hilerich and Bradsby bats? Since we don’t have year specific offerings in the way of All Star or World Series bats to reference from the early to mid 1940s, it might be insightful to look at when this information begins to appear as a reference in player production information. This should be seen within the context of the purpose a model number as previously detailed. The currently accepted date for this has only been identified as the mid 1940s, but what is this based on and are there early references?\n\nSince model numbers are a focal point of study and discussion as they relate to player order sheets and production information, I decided to see when the earliest references to model numbers could be found.\n\nModel Number Recorded for the First Time In a Players Order Sheet:\n\nLuke Appling: Model #A31 on 6/3/41\n\nBen Chapman: Model #C10 on 6/17/39\n\nJoe Cronin: Model # C118 on 6/2/41 and “his model sent in” C118- 6/14/41\n\nKi Ki Cuyler: Model # C115 on 6/5/41\n\nBobby Doerr: Model # D2 on 2/24/40\n\nChuck Dresser: Model # D51 on 2/29/39\n\nLew Fonseca: Model #F16 on 4/30/41\n\nLonny Frey: Model #F36-2/26/41 and “his 1/10/40” small model F78-4/11/42\n\nLou Gehrig: Model G69 “5/13/31 with Ruth Knob” on 4/25/39\n\nHank Greenberg: “Same as last year, his 5/15/39” Model # G62 on 3/28/1941\n\nLefty Grove: “Joe Cronin on end. C-1 model sent in”. Model # C1 on 7/24/40\n\nChick Hafey: “His 4/25/28 H4”. Model H4 on 4/4/42\n\nChuck Klein: “New Model made K55”. Model K55 on 4/30/35.\n\nHal Trosky: “New Model Made T14” Model T14 on 4/30/40.\n\nWhile some of these entries may have had the model numbers written in a later date, this does not appear to the case in all instances. I think a valid observation would be that at some level, Hillerch and Bradsby began an alpha-numeric identification of their products in the late 1930s to early 1940s. While the records I looked at don’t seem to indicate this in a consistent manner until the mid 1940s, it does offer for question could model numbers have appeared on bats as early as say 1941 since this convention was established and being utilized on some level. Think about answering this question for yourself against the backdrop of what I articulated about the purpose and functions of a model number. Also if you have always just accepted the position that model numbers did not begin to appear on Hillerich & Bradsby bats until the mid 1940s, ask yourself what have you based this on? I would welcome thoughts and discussion on this topic.\n\nThe other thing I have often wondered about the Hillerich & Bradsby alpha-numeric identification of their products and the source of those, is how many duplicate models it may have resulted in as having been produced over the years. Consider this example involving these four fictional players.\n\nJoe Bat\n\nEd Glove\n\nSam Cap\n\nMike Mitt\n\nVeteran Joe bat uses the model B1.\n\nRookie Ed Glove uses the model G1, but likes the handle on the B1. He requests that a new bat be made for him using the G1 only with a B1 handle. This bat now becomes the G2.\n\nFor the sake of discussion, 5 years transpire since the G2 was made.\n\nSam Cap is a teammate of Ed Glove and he really likes G2. Mike Mitt is also a team mate and he uses the B1. Sam swings both bats and likes something about both of them. He wishes the G2 had a handle like B1. He then sends in a request for a G2 with a B1 handle. A new bat is made for him and becomes the C1.\n\nBut what is the C1? It is the same bat as the B1.\n\nThis has no general hobby impact, but as I was thinking about model numbers in general, this crossed my mind.\n\nAs always, collect what you enjoy and enjoy what you collect.\n\nDave Grob\n\nFor questions or comments on this article, please feel to drop me a line at DaveGrob1@aol.com.\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Grob\n\nDave Miedema informed me late Friday night that his computer was in the shop and he would not be able to provide his weekly Sunday News Extra.

The Shirt examines many of them now.\n\nFIRST NAMES: Vida Blue, whose career took of in 1971 with Oakland, decided a couple of years later to go with VIDA instead of BLUE on his jerseys. The practice continued during his later stints with the Giants and Royals.\n\nAlso, his Oakland teammate, Billy Conigliaro, wore 1973 jerseys identifying him as BILLY C., a photo of which can be found on his 1974 Topps card.\n\nNICKNAME: The Cleveland Indians had Ken “Hawk” Harrelson in their employ from a few weeks into the 1969 season through 1971. The ’69 season was the final year that the Tribe wore vest flannels, and Harrelson employed a NOB of HAWK on his.\n\nHOMETOWN: The pride and joy of Wampum, Pennsylvania, Dick Allen, played for the A’s in 1977, and, in addition to wearing the unorthodox number 60, placed WAMPUM on the back of his McAuliffe gamers.\n\nTEAM TRENDS: The 1963 A’s ordered a set of odd vests that were forerunners of the 1970s doubleknits from Wilson, and put player first names and nicknames on the backs of these gold gamers. Pitcher Bill Fischer, for example, was FISH, and infielder Sammy Esposito was SAMMY. This genre also produced one of the most misrepresented baseball jerseys the hobby has ever seen. Pitcher Ed Rakow wore #21 in 1963, with his NOB being ROCK. This jersey has been offered numerous times, however, as a Rocky Colavito gamer, despite the fact that Colavito played for Kansas City in 1964, not ’63, and the fact that he wore #7 (see 1964 Auravision record photo) with the A’s, not #21.\n\nAlso in this genre were the briefly used 1976 Atlanta Braves home NOB jerseys. The red pinstriped home pullovers, made by Wilson, carried first names (MAX for pitcher Maximino Leon) and nicknames (CANNON for outfielder Jim Wynn). The jerseys were banned, however, by humorless Commissioner Bowie Kuhn after Ted Turner, the Braves’ owner, decided to push the envelope a bit too much. Acquiring pitcher Andy Messersmith from the Dodgers a few weeks into the season, Turner added the NOB of CHANNEL to Messersmith’s #17 jersey…a subtle advertisement for one of his TV stations. Kuhn put the hammer down, and the jerseys were pulled and/or stripped of their NOBs.\n\nMORE PATCHES\n\nWith a tip of the New Era cap to Murf Denny, we have news of memoriam patches being worn in 2009 by Cleveland and Toronto. The Indians have a patch for Herb Score, bearing his old uniform number (27) with a microphone representing his broadcasting career separating the two digits. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays have a TED patch for their late owner, Ted Rogers.\n\nEYEFULS FROM EBAY\n\nThree jerseys recently offered a look at items that were misidentified as to player, team, and overall authenticity.\n\nVery shortly after the death of Mark “The Bird” Fidrych, a Tigers home knit of the late pitcher was up for bids on the ‘Bay. It did draw at least one bid, despite the fact that (a) it was the wrong supplier (jersey was Rawlings, Tigers homes in that era were made by Wilson), (b) no tagging existed of the type used by either of the above companies, and (c) the number font was totally off for the back numerals. Someone thinks they won the Bird, but instead got a phony for the birds.\n\nNot only are minor league-issued Orioles jerseys being offered in some quarters as MLB Orioles BP jerseys, but the same misrepresentation is now being seen increasingly with minor league Padres tops. The jerseys have no NOBs, a feature used on Major League Pads pregame shirts since the mid-1980s. On top of that, the navy blue (post-1989) jerseys, in addition to being bereft of NOB, also have been made by Rawlings, last seen as a Padres source in 1991. The improperly attributed attire dates to the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Padres BP duds were supplied by Russell and Majestic, not Rawlings.\n\nFinally, a longtime excellent dealer of cards who is unfortunately out of his element in the jersey market acquired a load of Red Sox game and BP jerseys from the Fenway Park sale earlier this year. With home jerseys not bearing NOBs nor any name tagging, the seller recently placed a #12 2002 Red Sox home gamer up for bids. The seller evidently consulted a regular season roster, which shows Cliff Floyd as #12. Problem is, the jersey is a size 44. Floyd is 6-4 and 230 pounds…he wouldn’t have fit into that jersey after Junior High! A look at the team’s 2001 roster shows #12 as Chris Stynes, 5-9 and 170, and the proper size for a size 44 of today. Floyd has been in jerseys as large as a size 56 over the last few seasons. My belief is that the jersey was made for Stynes, but not worn by him, as his 2002 season was spent with the Cubs.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nEd Blake, a pitcher with short stints with Cincinnati (1951-53) and Kansas City (1957) died April 15. He was 83. Blake’s biggest MLB memory came before his pro career, as, having just graduated from high school, he was tapped to throw BP for the 1943 Cardinals during the World Series.\n\nGene Handley, a member of the 1946-47 Philadelphia A’s, died at age 94 on April 12.\n\nGlen Gondrezick, and NBA [layer of the Dr. J era, died from complications from a heart transplant April 27, Age 53 at time of death, he played for the Knicks and Nuggets from 1977-83, and preceded his NBA career with a roster spot on the 1977 UNLV Final Four team.\n\nFinally, Jack “Lucky” Lohrke, nicknamed as such due to several occasions of cheating serious injury and/or death before he made the Show, died April 29 at age 85. His MLB career was with the Giants and Phillies from 1947-53. Before that, however, he had narrow escapes from tragedy in World War 2, surviving while fellow soldiers close to him were killed; and also in 1946, when a phone call at a lunch stop telling him to report to San Diego took him off the ill-fated bus carrying the Spokane team which would later crash, claiming 9 victims.\n\nBULLS-CELTICS…THE NBA DOESN’T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT!\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Miedema\n\nON A FIRST NAME BASIS\n\nWhile names on backs (NOBs) have, since their 1960 inception, primarily employed player last names, the occasional first name, nickname, or other ID has popped up over the years.

Beginning in 1994, and running through 1999, the company name was combined with a multicolored mountain peaks logo, usually related to the colors of the team the jersey was made for. While a few of these were carried over into 2000, the bulk of Majestic\n\nBP jerseys, as well as game jerseys, carried a mountain peaks logo with no supplier name. One notable exception involved some Majestic 2000 game jerseys. Majestic was introduced to the game jersey fold that year, supplying seven ballclubs. Four of them, the Brewers, Blue Jays and both Chicago teams, had their unies subcontracted to Wilson, resulting in, among other things, a sewn-on Majestic sleeve patch (Majestic themselves embroiders their logos directly into the fabric). Subsequent years’ apparel, as well as the 2000 White Sox Playoff Jerseys, were done in-house.\n\nRAWLINGS:\n\nRawlings was the first contracted supplier of MLB uniforms, getting the deal from 1987-91, and again as one of three official suppliers from 2000-2002. The company name was used in script form for their first stint as MLB uniform source, and, during the second run, an oval with a scripted capital R was employed.\n\nThe changeover from the former to the latter Rawlings insignia was done in 1998, as evident from minor league jerseys of the era. Unlike the Majors, minor league teams have a choice of any supplier, and, with no contract in play with the minors, any supplier can use a sleeve logo. A few Buffalo Bisons gamers from 2007-08 even show a newer logo incorporating both previously-used elements. How many other instances of this dual logo that are out there is something I can’t answer at this time.\n\nMLB POTPOURRI\n\nOne recent uniform item of note: April 22 was the 94th anniversary of the introduction of the classic Yankees uniform pinstripes, a uniform design still employed by the Yanks to this day on their home attire.\n\nTwo uniform items no longer being used in 2009: the Mets have dropped their road alternate NEW YORK front black jersey. The former home “Mets” black jersey now is the norm both at and away from Citi Field.\n\nAlso noteworthy, the Cubs have done away with their road game caps, a style with the same blue crown and logo as the home all-blue cap, but with a red brim. The road style was first used in 1994. The all-blue lid is now both home and road standard.\n\nMay 16th is the date of the White Sox game-used garage sale at U.S. Cellular Field. Held in conjunction with other events at the ballpark while the Pale Hose are on the road, the sale will run from 9AM-2PM.\n\nNew MLB memoriam patches of note: The “34” memoriam patch for Nick Adenhart, wore on the chest of Angels attire, along with the diamond-shaped PRESTON patch on the right sleeve remembering Preston Gomez. Second, the HK patch eulogizing Hall of Fame announcer Harry Kalas, worn on the left chest of Phillies unies. And, last but not least, the Carl patch the Twins have employed for deceased owner Carl Pohlad. This patch is worn on the right sleeve of Twins shirts, underneath the Metrodome Final Season patch.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nMark Fidrych, the phenomenon known as The Bird to 1976 era baseball fans, was found dead on his farm April 13th as the result of a farm accident. Fidrych was 1976 American league Rookie of the Year with a 19-9 record, but an arm injury the next season was the beginning of the end of his career.\n\nHarry Kalas, Phillies announcer since 1971, NFL Films voice and Baseball Hall of Famer, was found unresponsive in the announcers’ booth before the April 13 Phils-Nats game. He was declared dead at the hospital, the result of a heart ailment.\n\nMerle Harmon, the first voice of the Milwaukee Brewers (1970-79) and owner of the successful chain of Merle Harmon’s Fan Fair souvenir stores, died April 15 after a prolonged illness. He was 82.\n\nDoc Blanchard,died of pneumonia April 19th. The 84-year old Blanchard spent his days at Army playing Mr. Inside, while he and teammate Glenn Davis (Mr. Outside) led Army to two consecutive NCAA National Championships in 1944-45.\n\nSHEPP-DOG>>>WELCOME TO THE 500 HR CLUB!\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Miedema\n\nMAJESTIC/RAWLINGS SLEEVE LOGOS\n\nThe sleeve logos used by these two past and present MLB suppliers have changed since they first hooked up with MLB contracts, and the next few paragraphs will detail what was worn when.\n\nMAJESTIC: The current exclusive MLB uniforms supplier, Majestic first was a partial MLB official supplier in 1990, getting a license to create BP jerseys.\n\nFrom that year through 1993, the sleeve logo was merely the company name in dual case print. Beginning in 1994, and running through 1999, the company name was combined with a multicolored mountain peaks logo, usually related to the colors of the team the jersey was made for. While a few of these were carried over into 2000, the bulk of Majestic\n\nBP jerseys, as well as game jerseys, carried a mountain peaks logo with no supplier name.

For the purposes of this discussion as well as the previous statement, we’re not discussing manufacturer or size tags. No, collectors usually like to see notations such as the year of usage, maybe the set number, a name or numeric player ID, and, on rare occasions, an inventory number. Most teams carry at least one of these items in their current game attire, although a handful…Tampa Bay, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Houston, for example…have been largely tagless since 2000.\n\nA few tagless teams is not a recent occurrence. Even in the 1970s, there were a few styles of the then-newfangled doubleknits that didn’t feature the numbers and names hobbyists like to see. The Shirt will feature a nearly complete list of 1970s knits that bore only a supplier label, generally with the size included in the design.\n\nBaltimore: The Orioles were very tag-friendly on their Wilson, Rawlings, and Spalding knit gamers, but the one style from 1971-79 not made by those three…the 1971 orange pullover alternates…were tagless. The style was made by Brooks Robinson Sporting Goods, and the HoFer’s company tagged pretty much nothing it made…that included O’s Old-Timers Game garb in the later ’70’s, as well as the prototype for the ABA Baltimore Claws, who folded before playing a game.\n\nCalifornia Angels: Virtually anything supplied to the Halos by Los Angeles-based Goodman and Sons were tagless items, except for the 1979 Angels ALCS home whites, of which I have only seen two in my 30-plus years of jersey collecting (a Frank Tanana and a Joe Rudi).\n\nChicago White Sox: The Veeck-designed 1976 Rawlings pullovers with the oversized collars were untagged 90 percent of the time. Occasional examples will emerge with a set 1 flag tag, but those are minimal in quantity.\n\nCincinnati: Tagless Wilson road knits were the norm for the 1972-76 time frame, although many examples feature a markered set number (1, 2, or 3) handwritten on the Wilson label.\n\nCleveland: Normally a tagging team, one can find nearly all 1975 Wilson gamers to not bear the year tag that other years included. Also, as in the case of the 1976 White Sox garb mentioned earlier, team budget constraints found the tagless threads being worn periodically one and even two seasons later.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers: You can find tagged jerseys, featuring year and set notations, for some 1970s Goodman issuances, but not, from my experiences, on home or road Dodgers duds from 1976, 1977, or 1979.\n\nWRONGLY TAGGED THREADS\n\nThere are still too many NFL retail jerseys, discernable by a separate Pro Line tag on items made by companies who didn’t use the notation on team-issued items, being offered as gamers on eBay. Three popped up in the past week, including a Russell Eagles jersey, a Bears Champion shirt, and one from Wilson of the Colts. Sad to say, all three companies never featured Pro Line notations on the tagging of any of their team-issued garb. In the case of the Bears jersey, the Pro Line tag replaced the team-exclusive tag in the dual tagging on the tail. The Wilson fake showed the 1995 shield logo on the tag…appropriate for sleeves on ’95 NFL game attire, but NEVER on the Wilson tag.\n\nHAPPY ANNIVERSARY, LOUISVILLE SLUGGER\n\nLouisville slugger will be celebrating the 125th anniversary of their existence as a MLB bat supplier by placing a logo on 2009-issued MLB game bats. Located between the centerbrand and the barrel ID notations, the logo will bear the 125th designation, as well as the years involved (1884-2009). Louisville has only placed special logos on their bats twice before: the BiCentennial Liberty Bell logo in 1976, and the pink ribbon insignia for Mothers’ Day/Breast Cancer Awareness Pink Bats, beginning in 2006.\n\nRETRO BECOMES REGULAR\n\nWord comes from Wisconsin’s Murf Denny that the 2009-10 NBA season will find the Philadelphia 76ers making the current season’s 1983-style Hardwood Classics design their regular style for all games. As in that bygone season, home versions will be white and road designs will be red.\n\nGIVE IT TO THE KID…\n\n…Not the course of action of most adult game-used collectors, but the definitive choice of one NBA player recently.\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas of the Cleveland Cavaliers entered the NBA 10,000 career point club on March 21st, and team officials were looking to retrieve the game ball that scored that milestone point to give to Ilgauskas. Problem was, the ball somehow made it into the stands after the game, and was gone by the time team officials began searching in earnest. Local media immediately began calling for the ball’s new owner to turn the ball over to the Cavs for Ilgauskas.\n\nThe thing was, the ball was not in the hands of a memorabilia dealer or even a diehard NBA collector, but rather an 8-year old kid. The kid’s mother, seeing the media outcry over returning the prized ball, called the Cavs and explained the circumstances. Ilgauskas contacted the family, and, noting the pressure being placed on a grade-school youngster, defused the dilemma by telling the boy that he could keep it. A nice ending if the kid enjoys his souvenir from an NBA game, but not so nice if the ball shows up on eBay in a few weeks…here’s hoping for the former.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nLou Saban, who played for the NFL Browns from 1946-49, and coached the Patriots, Bills and Broncos of both the AFL and AFC over 16 years, died from heart failure March 29 at age 87. Saban had two coaching stints with the Bills, winning the AFL Championship the first time around in 1964-65, and, after returning, coached O.J. Simpson.\n\nHerman Franks, a former big league catcher and manager, died on March 30 at age 95. Franks caught in the National League (1939-41) with St. Louis and Brooklyn before serving in World War 2, and, upon his playing resumption, caught for the Athletics and Giants in the 1947-49 time frame. He managed both the Giants (1965-68) and Cubs (1977-79), never winning a pennant or division title, but scoring four consecutive 2nd place finishes during his years in San Francisco.\n\nTHE BEARS HAVE A FRANCHISE QB AT LAST!!\n\nMEARS Sunday News Extra by Dave Miedema\n\nTAGLESS THREADS\n\nCollectors are usually more comfortable with baseball gamers that have tags included.
