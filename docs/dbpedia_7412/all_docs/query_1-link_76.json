But she didn't start digging deep into the roots of country, folk and bluegrass until she joined the Broadway company of the Roger Miller musical \"Big River\" in the 1980s. During her two-year stint in the show, she began researching the works of pioneering artists like the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, Bill Monroe, Doc Watson and Jean Ritchie.\n\nAfter the show closed, Glaze moved to Southern California and began honing her bluegrass chops. By 1999, she was good enough to win best traditional singing honors at the Topanga Banjo and Fiddle Contest and Folk Festival. She released her debut CD in 2002 and two years later started touring the country playing Ritchie's traditional Appalachian songs. The legendary folk singer was impressed. In a letter to Glaze, Ritchie wrote, \"I don't know if you realize it, but you're the only one who respects my melodies enough not to reinvent them.\"\n\nSeven years ago, Glaze and her husband, mandolin player Steve Rankin, formed the HiLonesome Band. The group will mix traditional Appalachian roots music with contemporary \"new bluegrass\" energy when they perform at 8 tonight in the Borchard Community Center, 190 N. Reino Road, Newbury Park. The show is part of the Fireside Concert Series. Admission is $7 at the door. For more information, call 499-3511.
