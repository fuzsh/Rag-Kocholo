I was (supposedly) on an elevator and he stepped in, and I talked to him for about 10 minutes after the ride. (I don't remember this, either, but the girl who was with me swears it happened, and says she remembers it so clearly because of the way I started taking to Anderson like him suddenly getting on the elevator with us was the most normal thing in the world, while she was so freaked that it happened she never said a word the whole time.)\n\nIt was my 50th birthday in April this year. In July I got Jay's autograph on the first Son Volt CD, backstage at Calgary Folk Music Festival.\n\n_____________________________\n\nWhere do I start.\n\nPoliticians\n\nPrime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and then wife Margaret Trudeau on the program sheet at a private Liberal Party fund raising dinner in Winnipeg, MB, 1972.\n\nNovels\n\nseveral SF authors including William Gibson, Spider Robinson, Joe Haldeman, and Charles de Lint.\n\nFestival staff pass\n\nKris Kristofferson (2006, Calgary Folk Music Festival)\n\nTour books.\n\nHarry Chapin from around 1976, 77.\n\nKeith Emerson, Greg Lake, Carl Palmer, from the early 1990s.

But...\n\nI treasure the signature of a little-known jazzy artist of the 80's named Robert Kraft. He was a buddy of Bruce Willis back in the salad days, and had a jazz combo with his brother called The Ivory Coast. Later he got a producing gig with Disney, and did a few of their animated soundtrack albums. I especially love his album, Moodswing.\n\nIt matters to me, because I discovered his music from a pile of un-heard radio promo albums, and later wrote him a letter. He wrote me a nice one back, and signed it. He wasn't one of the \"majors\", but he took the time to write a thank-you while his career was in transition.\n\nI have never forgotten, \"It takes a keen eye to know what's a dead end, and what's a false start.\"\n\nI've got on e of those as well. There were only 1,000 of 'em, I believe. Had to buy about 10 copies 'til I got one -- via mail order, if I remember correctly.\n\nThese are all great stories! I'm extremely jealous of everyone who has any Beatles autographs, particularly John's...\n\nI have the regular Beatles-fans circuit autographs, like Pete Best, Mark Hudson, Joey Molland, Billy Preston (RIP). I must say I really cherish my Barry Tashian autographs and photos with him--he's one of my favorites, and he was so incredibly nice. Lloyd Green, the legendary steel guitarist, signed my copy of Sweethearts of the Rodeo when I met him in Nashville.\n\nI really love my Ian \"Mac\" MacLagan autograph, too.\n\nI have a humorous autograph story...Kelley Deal (twin sister of Kim of the Pixies, member of The Breeders with her sister) was playing a gig at a very small club in Knoxville called The Mercury Theatre (RIP) about 11 years ago. I brought my Breeders' Last Splash cd for her to sign if possible. As she walked by, I politely stopped her and asked if she would please sign my cd, to which she replied, \"You know I'm not Kim, right?\" I assured her that I knew who she was. She signed the inside cover, and since she had lost a lot of weight since the photo was taken, she proceeded to color in a smaller waist line for herself! (I was saddened to hear that she was arrested for heroin possession very shortly after that gig! I think she's doing well now.)\n\nI JUST saw Stewkey with his New Nazz group last week! They were quite good and it was great to hear him belting out those classic Nazz tunes. He's still got it - totally nailed \"Hello It's Me\" and \"Under the Ice\"! Check him out if he comes around near you! I could have gotten his autograph, but I just wanted to enjoy the show...............I'll probably regret not trying - oh well!\n\nI also forgot another autograph that I like though I didn't get it in person:\n\nYears ago I picked up a used LP of the 1978 album \"Live Grape\" from the sort-of reformed Moby Grape. It was only $2, not in great shape, but okay. Played it, filed it and that was that. Maybe a year later I pull it out to spin again and I notice writing on the cover (the cover is a dark maroon - the writing was in blue, ball-point pen ink and not at all obvious at first......). What does it say? (In very neat script I should mention........) \"To my good friend Jimmy. Rock on, bro! SKIP SPENCE\"!\n\nThat one still amazes me - for all that's been written about his problems, the guy had beautiful handwriting! Too cool.\n\n------- Chris\n\nIn response to a couple of private requests, I am posting a picture of Brazilian volleyball stars (of the 1990s) Ana Paula (left) and Fernanda. They are both about 6'1\" and very fit. And when I met them, they turned out to be very well-mannered and gracious young ladies.\n\nAttached Files:\n\nAP&FV.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n33.5 KB\n\nViews:\n\n3"
