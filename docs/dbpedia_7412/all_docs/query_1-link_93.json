        "text": "On January 15, 2020, the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame announced their 2020 inductees, which included a semi-diverse list of artists, including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, The Doobie Brothers, T. Rex (long overdue), The Notorious B.I.G. and the only woman to be inducted in the 2020 class, Whitney Houston.\n\nWhile it was hoped that Pat Benatar and Chaka Khan (as half of Rufus and Chaka Khan) would also be inducted this year, it’s not surprising they weren’t. At the very least, the Dave Matthews Band didn’t get in. How the fuck did they get nominated in the first place? Christ. But I digress.\n\nA couple of days before the Rock Hall inductees were announced, the Academy Award nominees were announced. Only one woman of color was nominated for a major acting award and no female directors (and there were many in 2019) were nominated.\n\nHere on the blog, I know I’ve often mentioned the lack of women in the Rock Hall, and I know I’m not the only one who feels that way. And, with the double whammy of the Oscar nods and the Rock Hall inductees this week, I’m hopeful that by 2021, we’ll see a lot more women nominated everywhere.\n\nOn the day the Rock Hall inductees were announced, I read an article online about 10 female artists who should be in the Rock Hall (and five who might be next). At the top of the list, Carole King. Abso-fucking-lutely. One of the greatest songwriters of all-time, her 1971 TAPESTRY album was so huge, it spent 15 weeks atop the BILLBOARD album chart, won four Grammy Awards, has sold over 25 million copies worldwide, and was the No. 2 album of the year in the U.S. for both 1971 and 1972, and the No. 22 album for 1973. Pretty fucking amazing.\n\nOther women on the list I would certainly vote for included Björk, Kate Bush, Dolly Parton and The Go-Go’s. Courtney Love and her band, Hole, were on the list as well, and as was written in the article, “this one should be a no-brainer.” WTF?! She is only on the list because she was married to Kurt Cobain. She did a decent acting job in a couple movies in the late 90s (including 1998’s MAN ON THE MOON), and the band had one okay song, but really? A “no-brainer?” How about just NO!!! I would much rather have chosen Mariah Carey and Sheryl Crow (both on the list) over Courtney Love, and those are artists I am not really a fan of. And nowhere (again) on the list was Cyndi Lauper.\n\nI’ve made my case for Cyndi to be in the Rock Hall (or at least nominated, fer fuck’s sake) many times here on the blog, and you can go back and read about my reasons for why she should have been inducted years ago, so if you see #Cyndi2021 trending anywhere this year, that’s prolly why.\n\nEven Steve Miller (who has had his own issues with the Rock Hall) called them out when he was inducted in 2016, and said, “keep expanding your vision, to be more inclusive of women.” That’s goddamned right.\n\nThe Go-Go’s are definitely worthy of being in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. The Los Angeles New Wave / Punk Rockers, formed in 1978 and consisting of singer Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin on rhythm guitar, Kathy Valentine on bass guitar, Charlotte Caffey on lead guitar and keyboards, and drummer Gina Schock, were the first all-female group to reach No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s album chart with their 1981 album, BEAUTY AND THE BEAT.\n\nThe album spent six weeks on top in March and April 1982, sold over two million copies in the U.S. alone, was the No. 2 album in America for 1982, and was one of the biggest debut albums of all-time. To date, The Go-Go’s remain as the only all-female band to both write their own songs and play their own instruments on an album that reached No. 1 on the BILLBOARD album chart. Still pretty impressive nearly 40 years later.\n\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAT was released in early July 1981 on I.R.S. Records, and took awhile for it to catch on. The first single released from the album, “Our Lips Are Sealed,” also took awhile to catch on, but it ultimately reached No. 20 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100, and also took its time leaving the survey, spending its 30th and final week on the Hot 100 in late March 1982. It was on the chart so long, it ranked at No. 63 for all of 1982, beating out about 20 Top 10 hits, including their own single, “Vacation” (the No. 8 title track from their 1982 album).\n\nThe second single chosen from BEAUTY AND THE BEAT was “We Got The Beat,” released this week in January 1982. Written by Charlotte Caffey, this song made its original 1980 appearance on Stiff Records, and in the U.K., was released as a single in July 1981. It was so popular in the dance clubs, the import got so much play, it even reached No. 35 on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart in 1981.\n\nThe re-recorded version you hear on BEAUTY AND THE BEAT did not take long to debut on the BILLBOARD Hot 100. Just a couple weeks after its release, it debuted at No. 79 in late January 1982, and just two weeks later, debuted inside the Top 40 at No. 31. By mid-March, the catchy two-and-a-half-minute New Wave / Dance classic had beat its way to the Top 10.\n\nFor three weeks in April 1982, “We Got The Beat” stayed at No. 2 on the Hot 100, held off by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts’ monster hit, “I Love Rock N’ Roll,” and stayed on the chart for 19 weeks, exiting in early June 1982, nearly a full year after the release of BEAUTY AND THE BEAT. “We Got The Beat” also reached No. 3 in Canada, No. 29 in Austria and No. 7 on BILLBOARD’s Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nNERDY CHART FACT: Both “We Got The Beat” and the namesake of the The Go-Go’s originated from a song they covered, “Going To A Go-Go,” a 1965 hit by The Miracles, co-written, co-produced and sung by the legendary Smokey Robinson. The week after “We Got The Beat” left the BILLBOARD Hot 100, a live version of “Going To A Go-Go” by The Rolling Stones debuted on the chart. So, in a way, the Go-Go’s kept beating on until “Vacation” immediately followed The Stones into the Top 40 in July 1982.\n\nThe Go-Go’s broke up in 1985, after their third album, 1984’s TALKSHOW, Belinda Carlisle and Jane Wiedlin had successful solo careers, got back together briefly in 1990 and 1994, and have been together for over 20 years, and released their fourth album, the wonderful GOD BLESS THE GO-GO’s, in 2001. In the summer of 2018, a musical about the band, HEAD OVER HEELS, premiered in New York.\n\n“We Got The Beat” was named as one of “The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame’s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock And Roll,” a list that includes songs by the also-yet-to-be-nominated/inducted Siouxsie And The Banshees, Salt-N-Pepa, The B-52’s and the aforementioned Cyndi Lauper.\n\nToday (January 18, 2020) was the fourth annual Women’s March, which started worldwide the day after Donald Trump was sworn in as President Gas. This year’s protest march for women’s rights and more took place in many cities in the U.S., including an event in Portland, Maine.\n\nA hope I have for 2020 and beyond is that more women everywhere are recognized for the incredible work they do, not just in entertainment, and are treated (at least) as well and as fairly as their male counterparts. Nearly 40 years ago, five young women from L.A. shouted, “Yeah! We Got The Beat!”, and it was an inspiration to women everywhere. And women still have the beat and then some. It’s time for men everywhere to take notice and start dancing to that beat. It’s long overdue…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f55KlPe81Yw\n\nI was quite late jumping on to the Siouxsie And The Banshees train. I was a fan of Top 40 music for many years, before branching out in 1987 (thanks to my new friend, Michael) into more Alternative music (called Modern Rock back in the day).\n\nThe memory in my ginormous melon is a bit fuzzy on this, but I honestly believe my first introduction to Siouxsie And The Banshees was with 1988’s “Peek-A-Boo.” The band had been together for 12 years at that point, and had been releasing music for 10 years.\n\nWhile American college radio had been enjoying the London band’s first eight studio albums and one live album, commercial American radio was late in hopping aboard on the Siouxsie train as well. By 1988, Siouxsie Sioux and Co. had racked up 14 Top 40 hits in their U.K. homeland, while “Peek-A-Boo” was their first American hit.\n\nThe following year, The Creatures (a side project away from The Banshees featuring Siouxsie Sioux and drummer Budgie) released their second album, BOOMERANG, and I fell in love with the remixes of the gorgeous, pulsating “Standing There,” and the fun, playful “Fury Eyes.” I still have the CD single.\n\nFrom there, my love for the music of Siouxsie And The Banshees only grew. Unlike 1989’s brilliant BATMAN, which featured an incredible score by Danny Elfman and songs by Prince, 1992’s BATMAN RETURNS primarily featured Danny Elfman’s score throughout the film, but with a lone song featured in the movie – the stunning and haunting “Face To Face.” That song was co-written by Siouxsie And The Banshees and Danny Elfman, who orchestrated the song, and which was produced by Portland, Maine native, Stephen Hague.\n\nLater that year, their second singles compilation, TWICE UPON A TIME: THE SINGLES, was released, and I was able to catch up some with the band that had eluded me for so long. And by the time my STUCK IN THE 80s program first aired in 1996, Siouxsie And The Banshees became a regular staple throughout the show’s nearly 21 years.\n\nIt’s funny how you can love a band for so long, but become enamored with certain tracks much later after you discover them. That happened with me and 1984’s “Dazzle.” From their sixth studio album, HYÆNA(their only album to feature The Cure’s Robert Smith, on guitars and keyboards), “Dazzle” was dazzling from the start. The band recruited a 27-piece orchestra by the name of the “Chandos Players,” which played strings from a piece written by Siouxsie Sioux that originated on piano (which itself was originally called “Baby Piano”).\n\nFrom there, “Dazzle” thrusts itself into an incredible anthematic marriage of pounding drums and guitars and strings, complimented by Siouxsie Sioux’s stirring vocals, enhanced with the perfect amount of reverb.\n\nIn a 1984 MELODY MAKER review of HYÆNA by critic Steve Sutherland, “Dazzle” was referred to as “naively daring. Siouxsie’s voice, framed alone against the firmament of strings. It could be [Andrew] Lloyd Webber’s CATS or something by Vaughn Williams. You can get impressed, wrapped up and lost in this.”\n\nFrom a review of the 25th anniversary reissue of the album, “[HYÆNA] was [Siouxsie And The Banshees’] most experimental work, [Robert] Smith’s presence is keenly felt on the disciplined execution of the grandiose ‘Dazzle’” (which Robert Smith co-wrote with the band). “Dazzle” became the band’s 11th Top 40 U.K. hit (out of 18 total, between 1978 and 1994).\n\nEve since I’ve known the dazzling Maryhope, “Dazzle” has always been a huge part of playlists for any of her incredible radio shows on WMPG, and was on her playlist for the first time she filled in for me on STUCK IN THE 80s in late July 2006, not long after I had met her.\n\nAnd because of Maryhope, I latched onto a song I had known for years but didn’t latch on to initially for whatever reason. “Dazzle” may not be as well known as “Cities In Dust” or “Peek-A-Boo” or “Kiss Them For Me,” but it’s one of my favorite Siouxsie And The Banshees songs, and will dazzle for years to come. You should revisit it if you haven’t heard it in awhile. You’ll be dazzled too…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94wZxJBbv3g\n\nI have been a fan of Pat Benatar since the first time I heard “Heartbreaker” in late 1979. I own several of her albums, and yes, 12” singles too (hey – almost everybody did remixes back in the 80s!). But, oddly enough, as much as I have loved Pat Benatar and her music for almost 40 years, I have never seen her perform live. I am hoping to rectify that this Summer.\n\nThis week, I found out that Pat and her long-time husband and guitarist, Neil Giraldo, will be performing at Portland’s Maine State Pier for the second time in three years. In 2015, I believe they had the distinction of being the first performers at the Maine State Pier, performing in early May 2015. I wasn’t at that show, but from what I heard, it was incredibly cold (we were barely out of our longer-than-usual Winter that year) and I feared Pat wouldn’t be back to Maine again.\n\nThe Winter of 2014-2015 was what I classified as “The Winter That Would Never End,” in that it snowed on November 1, 2014, and snowed in six consecutive months, through April 2015. Even for Maine, that’s pretty unusual. I love Maine but not its Winters, and always hope they won’t last more than their calendared three months. (This year, Mom Nature is playing her own April Fool’s Joke on us, with several inches of snow predicted the first day of April.) I’m so glad Pat and Neil have picked to return to Portland’s Maine State Pier in late July, when – theoretically – it’ll be an awesome Summer (like 2016!).\n\nBy late 1983, the then-30-year-old from Brooklyn, NYC already had released four hugely successful albums, including a No. 1 album – 1981’s PRECIOUS TIME – and a No. 2 album – her biggest album to date, 1980’s CRIMES OF PASSION, which has been certified (at least) 4x Multi-Platinum. She had also nine out of 10 singles reach the Top 40 of the BILLBOARD Hot 100, including one Top 10 hit, “Hit Me With Your Best Shot,” which reached No. 9 in late December 1980.\n\nPat’s fifth release, a mostly-live album called LIVE FROM EARTH, was released in mid-October 1983, and contained two new studio tracks, “Lipstick Lies” and “Love Is A Battlefield,” the latter of which was written by popular songwriters Mike Chapman and Holly Knight, who have written a combined amount of huge songs that would require their own entire blog post, which I may write one day. I can say that Holly Knight (a member of the short-lived Dance / Rock band, Device) also wrote and/or co-wrote three other Pat Benatar songs, including 1985’s “Invincible (The Theme From THE LEGEND OF BILLIE JEAN).”\n\n“Love Is A Battlefield” was released a month in advance of LIVE FROM EARTH, and only took 12 days to reach the BILLBOARD Hot 100, debuting at No. 78. In just four weeks, “Love Is A Battlefield” debuted in the Top 40, giving Pat her tenth Top 40 American hit. In a chart coincidence that only a singles chart nerd like myself could love, “Love Is A Battlefield” also debuted in the Top 40 the same week as Eurythmics debuted with “Love Is A Stranger.”\n\nLike most Pat Benatar singles, “Love Is A Battlefield” made a steady climb up the chart and spent a week at No. 5 in early December 1983. It stayed on the Hot 100 until the second half of February 1984 and one of BILLBOARD’s biggest Hot 100 hits of 1984. With 1985’s “We Belong,” it remains her highest-charting American hit so far, and gave Pat her fourth consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.\n\nAround the globe, there was a lot of love for “Love Is A Battlefield.” It spent five weeks at No. 1 in Australia, four weeks at No. 1 in Holland and BILLBOARD’s Mainstream Rock chart, two weeks at No. 1 in Belgium, plus Top 10 rankings in Canada, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand, and the Top 20 in the U.K. and Switzerland.\n\nA special remix was used for the popular music video, which features Pat as a teenager running away from her family, Pat exploring the fast life in the big city, becoming a dancer, her father eventually showing regret for things he said that drove her away, and through all of this, she ends up discovering strength and independence, and the incredible undeniability of girl power. Pat also showed off some pretty cool dance moves in this partially-choreographed video, which was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video.\n\nI know the dancing and using a drum machine was out of Pat Benatar’s normal Rock ’n’ Roll element, and that remixes prolly weren’t her thing (although she’d end up releasing a few more; I know, because I own them), but in the end, “Love Is A Battlefield” is a song that worked, even when songwriter Mike Chapman didn’t think it would work, and even when Pat’s record company didn’t think it would work. But all’s fair in love and war and pop hits, right? What most folks involved with the record thought wouldn’t work is one of THE songs Pat Benatar is remembered most for to this day, and is a song I hope to hear her sing in Portland, Maine in late July.\n\nWriting about “Love Is A Battlefield” here made me think of a time back in the mid-00s, when I was still living in Portland and had a Saturday night retro DJ gig at one of the clubs intown, where, in the small, already crowded Alt-Rock / Dance and New Wave “rec room” full of the music of New Order, Blondie, Duran Duran, Smiths, Siouxsie & The Banshees, Nine Inch Nails and the oft-requested Elvis Costello, there wasn’t much room for Pat’s Benatar’s straight up, kick-ass Rock ’n’ Roll, but I remember a couple of times I got a request for something by Pat. And I was pleasantly surprised both times.\n\nThe first time Pat Benatar was requested, for a second, I thought, “what could I possibly play for this amazing crowd of people that would blend in?” The only song that came to mind – and what proved to be THE best choice – was the 12” dance remix of “Love Is A Battlefield.” When Pat was requested another time, the choice that time was a no-brainer, because, not only did “Love Is A Battlefield” get a sweet reception the first time, when it comes to dance music from the 80s, whether it’s Pop, Rock, Punk, Funk, Dance, Rap, New Wave, New Romantics – to me, there IS no battlefield.\n\n“We are strong / No one can tell us we’re wrong / Searching our hearts for so long / Both of us knowing / Love is a battlefield…”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGVZOLV9SPo\n\nWell, just three STUCK IN THE 80s shows to go on WMPG community radio (in Portland, Maine, USA), and on Sunday, 1.29.2017, my awesome and talented WMPG radio neighbor, DJ SHAXX (host of the kick-ass LEFT OF THE DIAL), and I will be teaming up for a second installment in celebrating the 12-inch single, extended remixes and even mash-ups on a show that we are calling 12inchTHROWDOWN Redux!\n\nOne band who knew a lot about releasing excellent 12” singles and remixes was the brilliant London Goth Rock / Post-Punk band, Siouxsie And The Banshees, who had already been around for 12 years and releasing music for 10 years before they finally (!) penetrating a tougher-than-it-should-have-been American music market.\n\nIn July 1988, a couple of months before releasing their ninth studio album, PEEPSHOW, Siouxsie And The Banshees, then comprised of Siouxsie Sioux (singer), Steven Severin (bass), Jon Klein (guitar), Budgie (drums / percussion / harmonica) and Martin McCarrick (cello / keyboards / accordion), released the album’s first single, “Peek-A-Boo.”\n\n“Peek-A-Boo” was a wonderful three-minute “peek” into a different direction for Siouxsie & Co., taking not-so-traditional instruments like the cello and the accordion, replete with thunderous drums, and smartly incorporating them into their Alt-Rock / Alt-Dance songs. You can hear the prominent and sweet use of then-new member Martin McCarrick’s accordion on “Peek-A-Boo.”\n\nAccording to a 2008 interview with PEEPSHOW producer, Mike Hedges, who had served as producer and/or engineer on four previous Siouxsie And The Banshees albums and the first album by The Creatures (Siouxsie and Budgie’s side project), “It all started a year or so before, when the Banshees made an album of cover versions called THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. On that album they’d recorded a version of a John Cale song called ‘Gun,’ and when we were recording it I turned it over – which you can do on analogue tape – and it sounded amazing. I think at the time I turned over pretty much everything, just in case there was something that sounded great going backwards which you could then record and add to the existing song. So, a bit later, when we were working on the next album, PEEPSHOW, we said, ‘Remember that track that sounded really good backwards? Could we possibly make it into another song?’”\n\nMike Hedges also added in that interview, “The Banshees were very, very experimental, and at that time in the music business you could be experimental. There was no pressure to do anything in a straight style, which isn’t really the case any more. ‘Peek-A-Boo’ was obviously a single for them, simply because it was one song that really was completely messed with. The unusual was expected of them.”\n\nUpon the song’s release, MELODY MAKER, the popular weekly British Pop / Rock music newspaper (which merged with NEW MUSIC EXPRESS in 2000), went on to describe “Peek-A-Boo” as “a brightly unexpected mixture of black steel and pop disturbance,” and compared its sound to “thirties hip hop.”\n\nThe British press was all over “Peek-A-Boo” from the start. Another weekly British Pop / Rock music newspaper, SOUNDS (which ended in 1991), wrote that “Peek-A-Boo” was “a brave move; playful and mysterious. The snare gets slapped, Siouxsie’s voice meanders all around your head and it all comes magically together.” NEW MUSIC EXPRESS exclaimed, “If this nation was served by anything approaching a decent pop radio station, ‘Peek-A-Boo’ would be a huge hit.”\n\nIn 2008, Kele Okereke, singer of the London Indie Rock / Alt-Dance band, Bloc Party, said this of “Peek-A-Boo”: “It sounded like nothing else on this planet. This is just a pop song that they put out in the middle of their career that nobody knows about, but to me it sounded like the most current but most futuristic bit of guitar-pop music I’ve heard.”\n\nWell, as it turned out, many people would soon know about (and love) “Peek-A-Boo.” In the U.K., it became their fifth Top 20 hit, reaching No. 16. In Ireland, it was the band’s fourth Top 20 hit, peaking at No. 18. Over here in the U.S., thanks in large part to its video getting a lot of play on MTV, “Peek-A-Boo” became the very first song to chart at No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s brand-new Modern Rock Tracks chart (now called Alternative Songs), spending two non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 in September 1988.\n\nA few weeks later, and a couple weeks before Halloween (which harkens another Banshees gem from 1981), “Peek-A-Boo” became the first Siouxsie And The Banshees song to debut on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 (it’s about time, dammit!), coming in at No. 92.\n\n“Peek-A-Boo” made a respectable run for the Top 40, but stopped at No. 53 for a couple of weeks in early November 1988, and spent a total of 14 weeks on the Hot 100. They would reach the Hot 100 once more – and this time, the Top 40 – when “Kiss Them For Me” reached No. 23 in October 1991.\n\nThe Silver Dollar Mix of “Peek-A-Boo,” which reached No. 14 on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart, has been a favorite remix of mine for a long time, and will be featured during the 12inchTHROWDOWN Redux show. I’ve always loved playing “Peek-A-Boo” on the radio and when DJing at one of the clubs in Portland back in the 00s. It’s so infectious, different and moves you in a way you didn’t think possible. Kinda like Siouxsie And The Banshees, huh?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxoWUPQxhnM\n\nHappy Halloween everyone!! (Well, it’s Halloween for another three hours and change here in Central Maine, where I write this…)\n\nIn the 20+ years I’ve been hosting and producing my little 80s radio program, STUCK IN THE 80s (on WMPG community radio in Portland, Maine), there have been a number of Halloween-themed shows aired, and they are always a lot of fun. Since this is the first Halloween for the blog, I debated on which song to highlight for my first Halloween-themed FOREVER YOUNG blog post. Michael Jackson’s “Thriller?” Siouxsie And The Banshees’ “Halloween?” Bow Wow Wow’s “I Want Candy?” All great choices, but then I thought about this fun gem from the frontman and founding member of The B-52’s, Fred Schneider.\n\nWith The B-52’s on hiatus in 1984, Fred recorded his first solo album away from the band. For this effort, both the band and album were called Fred Schneider And The Shake Society. On this album (which will definitely make you shake), he got some help from fellow bandmates Kate Pierson and Ricky Wilson (who passed away the following year), Patti LaBelle and Parliament-Funkadelic vet Bernie Worrell (who we lost in June 2016). Bernie Worrell co-produced the album with Fred Schneider, and also provided support on the synthesizer, clavinet and vocoder.\n\nThe first song on the album was also the first single – a hilarious albeit sexually suggestive song called “Monster.” (“There’s a monster in my pants / And It does a nasty dance / When it moves in and out / Everybody starts to shout / Monster, aaaah monster, aaaah…”) You get the idea. Well, I’m not sure if it was the song’s suggestive lyrics or the unwillingness of the record label (Warner Bros., the same label for The B-52’s) to promote the album, but “Monster” and its parent album did not do well.\n\nThe even more hilarious video featured a fun mix of Claymation, Fred Schneider dancing silly in red polka-dotted boxers, and guest appearances from Kate Pierson, Talking Header / Tom Tom Clubber Tina Weymouth, NYC drag performer, playwright and actor Ethyl Eichelberger, and famed artist Keith Haring. But, in the early days of MTV, the song’s lyrics outweighed the fact the video obviously didn’t take itself seriously, and it was one of the first videos banned by the network.\n\nFast forward to 1991, a couple of years after the huge success of The B-52’s comeback album, COSMIC THING. The band’s new label, Reprise Records (founded by in 1960 by Frank Sinatra and a sister label of Warner Bros.), re-released Fred Schneider’s neglected 1984 solo effort, repackaged the album as just FRED SCHNEIDER and remixed “Monster.” This time, it even reached the BILLBOARD Hot 100 for four weeks during July 1991, peaking at No. 85.\n\nFred Schneider would release another solo album in 1996, titled JUST FRED. He’s thankfully still with The B-52’s (check out their most recent live DVD, 2012’s amazing WITH THE WILD CROWD! LIVE IN ATHENS, GA), and since 2010, he has released four albums with his side project away from The B-52’s, The Superions.\n\nI know “Monster” isn’t your run-of-the-mill, traditional Halloween song, but for me, it’ll always be a favorite, especially the funny video, and a song I love sharing this time of year…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKp_RlihJew\n\nOne of the first things I learned about WMPG community radio in Portland, Maine when I started my little 80s radio program, STUCK IN THE 80s, there in 1996 was the Begathon. WMPG gets approximately 1/3 of its funding from the University of Southern Maine, approximately 1/3 from underwriting, and approximately 1/3 from listener donations. A large chunk of the latter comes from the Begathon. What started out as a 2-week pledge drive in which volunteer radio hosts would “beg” to raise money for the station is now split up into two 1-week pledge drives, one in the Spring and one in the Fall. It’s come a long way since my first Begathon in the Fall of 1996. My very last Begathon for WMPG will be on Sunday, 9.25.2016.\n\nOne of the most-requested “money” songs around Begathon time on STUCK IN THE 80s is this Psychedelic Furs gem from their 1988 compilation, ALL OF THIS AND NOTHING, which features favorites like “Love My Way,” “Pretty In Pink,” “Heartbreak Beat,” “The Ghost In You,” “Heaven” and “President Gas.” “All That Money Wants’ was recorded specifically for this compilation.\n\n“All That Money Wants” was a huge hit at college radio and was the third song to reach No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s then-new Modern Rock chart (following “Peek-A-Boo” by Siouxsie & The Banshees and “Just Play Music” by Big Audio Dynamite), spending three weeks on top in October 1988.\n\nIn a 2010 AllMusic review by Michael Sutton, he says “All That Money Wants” was “seen as a return to the Furs of old when it was included as a new track on ALL OF THIS OR NOTHING. It’s not. The tune merely combines the dissonance of their first full-length with their stronger melodic sensibilities in the mid-‘80s.”\n\nWell, I agree with part of that review, though I don’t know if I’d refer to “All That Money Wants” as “merely” anything, but, what I do know is that it is one the songs my listeners want around this time of year, for whatever meaning it has for them, if anything. Money doesn’t actually have to be involved, but for those folks who can afford to pledge to WMPG this time of year, “All That Money Wants” could turn into “All That ‘MPG Wants,” which is to get enough funding to keep on keepin’ on for another six months…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gti22zo6sm0\n\nI had known about and enjoyed the music of Londoner Siouxsie Sioux, her band, Siouxsie And The Banshees, and her other band, a side project with Banshees drummer Budgie – The Creatures – for many years before learning about “Right Now,” today’s “song of the day.”\n\nIn 2005, at a time when I was still living in Portland, Maine and Newbury Comics was still interested in being one of the best places to pick up CDs instead of trendy clothes, I found this incredibly cool compilation called NEW WAVES: 45 ORIGINAL 45s FROM THE POST PUNK ERA.\n\nNEW WAVES had great gems from the likes of M, Squeeze, The Buzzcocks, The Undertones, The B-52’s, Billy Bragg, The Buggles, The Tubes, Trio, Martha & The Muffins, Blondie, Joan Armatrading, Robert Palmer, Elvis Costello and “Right Now” by The Creatures.\n\nI still find it funny how I had no idea this song existed before 2005. And on top of that, it was actually a cover of a 1962 Jazz/Pop song by Herbie Mann! (Mel Tormé also recorded a version the same year.) The Creatures recorded a faithful cover version in the style of the 1960s original, replete with a brass section, and it paid off. It was a No. 14 hit on the U.K. singles chart, the band’s biggest hit.\n\nIn a great July 1983 review by writer Paul Colbert for the British weekly music newspaper, MELODY MAKER, he wrote:\n\n“The Creatures slipped through an unlocked back window, ransacked the place and left with the best ideas in a fast car. Like all the greatest criminal minds they strike without a warning and only they know the plan. We have to piece the clues into a cover story. From the earliest seconds of ‘Right Now’ you know you’re on shifting ground. Siouxsie baba da baping away to the noise of her own fingers clicking until Budgie barges in with congas on speed. Christ which way is this going? The one direction you don’t expect is a vagrant big band coughing out drunken bursts of brass in a Starlight Room of it’s [sic?] own making. Budgie and Siouxsie – the Fred and Ginger of the wayward world.”\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls, an all-female group from Los Angeles, covered the song for their 2007 debut album, not in the style of the original Herbie Mann version, but in the version by The Creatures.\n\nThe Creatures disbanded in 2004, but memorable songs like “Standing There,” “Fury Eyes,” “Miss The Girl” and “Right Now” live on. I think I’ll listen to them, um, right now…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_9SdrN6D-o"
