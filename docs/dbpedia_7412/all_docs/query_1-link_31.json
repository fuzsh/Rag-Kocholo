Whichever it is, you’ve probably started thinking about your festival plans already. To help you along, we’ve put together this handy guide to help you choose from best of the UK folk festivals this year.\n\nIncluded in this guide, you’ll find…\n\nBeardy Folk Festival\n\nBeardy Folk Festival is a thoughtfully curated Midsummer music festival that showcases a fantastic lineup of contemporary and traditional roots-inspired music. The festival takes place in the private grounds and secret walled garden of the Hopton Court Estate in South Shropshire.

The late Jack Hamilton, known for his involvement in the growth of the Sidmouth Folk festival, founded his own festival in Broadstairs after discovering its beautiful seaside location. The first festival, called The Folk Show, took place twice a day in Pierremont Park and expanded to include workshops, dance events, and song venues. Over the years, Folk Week has used almost every available venue in Broadstairs and has evolved into an event that involves the whole town. The festival is made possible by the dedication of an army of volunteers and has a significant economic impact on the local economy. Despite challenges, including the cancellation of the festival in 2020 due to the pandemic, Folk Week continues to adapt and provide opportunities for everyone to enjoy the music, dance, and fun that have been celebrated since the 1960s.\n\n2024 lineup: Announced so far, the lineup for Broadstairs Folk Week includes Oysterband, Le Vent du Nord, Daphne’s Flight, Kathryn Tickell and The Darkening, Jim Moray, Morganway, Tim Edey, Jim Causley and Miranda Sykes, Monster Ceilidh Band, Jez Lowe, Christina Alden & Alex Patterson, Tarren, Sally in the Woods, The Folk Detectives, Bonfire Radicals, Good Habits, Wychbury, Jennie Higgins and many more.\n\nIs there dancing?
