        "text": "Bass Transcriptions\n\nIf you'd like to commission a bass transcription -- or any other kind of transcription -- click here for a chat/quote. My transcription service is based on years of professional experience working for major music magazines and publishing houses around the world.\n\nIf you're interested, here's a list of the transcriptions/articles/analyses I've done for various magazines and publishers, including long stints at the US publication Bass Player, and Japan's Bass Magazine.\n\nThe transcriptions below (free, and for educational purposes only) are in A4-sized PDF format. If you have problems reading these files, click here to get the latest version of the free Adobe Reader.\n\nAbba - \"Dancing Queen\"\n\nBass: Rutger Gunnarsson\n\nCriminally under-sung bass maestro Rutger Gunnarsson can be heard on just about every Abba hit you can name (though British bassist Mike Watson also played on a few key tracks, too). \"Dancing Queen\" is Gunnarsson at his best: funky, in the pocket and effortlessly inventive.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nBryan Beller - \"Greasy Wheel\"\n\nBass: Bryan Beller\n\nPut simply, Bryan Beller's seminal second album rocks. This transcription of \"Greasy Wheel,\" (hosted on Bryan's own site), serves as a sampler for the full 140-page book of transcriptions, which can be purchased from Monsieur Beller's digital superstore.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nBreaking Benjamin - \"Breath\"\n\nBass: Mark James Klepaski\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nDavid Bowie - \"China Girl\"\n\nBass: Camine Rojas\n\nCarmine Rojas conjures up a superlative song-defining riff on the second track of David Bowie's landmark 1983 album, Let's Dance. (See above for a transcription of the title track \"Let's Dance.\")\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nDavid Bowie - \"Let's Dance\"\n\nBass: Camine Rojas\n\n\"Let's Dance,\" the title track of David Bowie's seminal 1983 album, features some classy low-end work by session-ace Carmine Rojas. (See below for a transcription of \"China Girl.\")\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nMeredith Brooks - \"Bitch\"\n\nBass: Paul Bushnell\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nThe Judds - \"Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)\"\n\nBass: Jack Williams\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nKate Bush - \"Rocket Man\"\n\nBass: Del Palmer\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nDeana Carter - \"Strawberry Wine\"\n\nBass: Glenn Worf\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChevelle - \"Face To The Floor\"\n\nBass: Dean Bernardini\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nJohn Coltrane - \"Giant Steps\"\n\nBass: Paul Chambers\n\nJust when you think you've had this tune in the bag for years, someone calls it near the end of a session - you know, after you've already had a few drinks - and you realize: A) It may well have been in your bag, but maybe the zipper wasn't done up as tightly as it should have been, and B) Maybe that fourth beer wasn't such a good idea...\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nMelissa Etheridge - \"I'm The Only One\"\n\nBass: Pino Palladino\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nEvanescence - \"Bring Me To Life\"\n\nBass: Francesco DiCosmo\n\nHeavier than a rhino and as punchy as Mike Tyson, Francesco DiCosmo's bass playing did much to shape the overall sound and impact of Evanescence's most famous number.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nSara Evans - \"Suds In The Bucket\"\n\nBass: Glenn Worf\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nFinger Eleven - \"Paralyzer\"\n\nBass: Sean Anderson\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nFive Finger Death Punch - \"Walk Away\"\n\nBass: Matt Snell\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nForeigner - \"Dirty White Boy\"\n\nBass: Rick WIllis\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nGeorgia Satellites - \"Keep Your Hands To Yourself\"\n\nBass: Rick Price\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nGodsmack - \"Love-Hate-Sex-Pain\"\n\nBass: Robbie Merrill\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nGodsmack - \"Re-Align\"\n\nBass: Robbie Merrill\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nSammy Hagar - \"Mas Tequila\"\n\nBass: Mona Gnader\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nHellyeah - \"Hell of a Time\"\n\nBass: Bob ZIlla\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nAllan Holdsworth - \"In The Mystery\"\n\nBass: Jimmy Johnson\n\n\"In The Mystery\" -- from Allan Holdsworth's 1985 album Metal Fatigue -- features yet more superb bass work from Jimmy Johnson, who knocks us dead with some killer lines conjured from a graphite-necked fretless Alembic Series I.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Clouds\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nThough Marcus Miller and Willie Weeks also feature on Naughty, it's Anthony Jackson who steals the show with his thundering low Cs and killer grooves. AJ pushed bass playing into new territory on the six tracks he graces on this album, not least because he played several of the songs on a four-string Fender bass tuned down two whole steps, in effect paving the way for the 5- and 6-string electric basses that are around today.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Move Me No Mountain\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nPut simply, Naughty contains some of the finest and funkiest bass playing this side of the Horsehead Nebula. This track goes some way toward explaining why...\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Nothing's Gonna Take You Away\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nThis tune is fine example of what a great rhythm section can do for a fairly standard medium-ballad number, with Anthony Jackson and Steve Ferrone working their collective magic to transform the song into a driving Latin-tinged pop classic.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Too Much Love\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nA lot of people think Anthony Jackson is the only bassist on Naughty, but this isn't quite true. There are three other bassists featured: Willie Weeks, Marcus Miller and Mark Stevens (Chaka's brother). However, this song is the only track on the album to credit two bass players, both Anthony jackson and Mark Stevens. Strange indeed...\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"All Night's All Right\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nJackson's rock-solid bass groove provides the foundation for this track, which showcases the band's hermetically tight rhythm section and some very interesting harmony.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Our Love's In Danger\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nJackson's nuance-packed playing on this track once again requires another detail-heavy transcription. Hey don't shoot the messenger! ;-)\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"What Cha' Gonna Do For Me\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nOn this, the title track of Chaka Khan's third solo album, Anthony Jackson's bass part is doubled throughout by a Moog synth. In spite of this, there's no doubt as to who's driving the low-end show. And no, it's not the Moog player...\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"I Know You, I Live You\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nThis at-times rhythmically explosive number is one of the most memorable tracks on the What Cha album, thanks to Anthony Jackson's measured but powerful playing and Arif Mardin's punchy horn arrangement.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Any Old Sunday\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nOn this track, Jackson once again demonstrates that groove and momentum need not be sacrificed when tackling a slower-paced track, in this case, a laid-back shuffle number.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"We Got Each Other\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nAs well as deviating from standard pitch by a quarter-tone, this song is also notable in that the bass player and the rest of the band seem to be grooving in different, albeit related, keys...\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Night Moods\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nThanks to Jackson's drivingly insistent lines, this atmospheric quasi-ballad number is shot through with a powerful sense of restrained energy, which merely serves to heighten the tension generated by Chaka's often low-register huskiness, the exotic #11-based harmony, and the otherworldly, delay-soaked flute.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Heed The Warning\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nAs well as serving as a classic example of how a great riff can build a whole song, this track also demonstrates how tiny deviations from the norm can have a subtle, but significant effect. As an added bonus, \"Heed The Warning\" also contains the finest bass-related moment on the whole of this album. (Well, I think so anyway!)\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Father He Said\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nMany bassists are so keen to show off their double-thump or 11-fingered tapping technique (often during a sensitive ballad) that they forget about their main function - to support the rest of the band while being sensitive to what's happening around them.On \"Father He Said,\" Anthony Jackson shows exactly how it should be done.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Fate\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nFor the second album in a row, Chaka's slappin' poppin' sibling Mark Stevens muscles in on Jackson's low-frequency territory, overdubbing lines that perhaps reflect the era in which the album was produced, if not the needs of the song...\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"I Know You, I Live You (Reprise)\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nAlthough there's no fresh material to speak of in terms of the bass, reprising of one of the most musically upbeat songs on the album is a great way to wrap things up.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Love Has Fallen On Me\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nAs you'd expect, a song written by Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't quite conform to the \"norms\" of pop songdom. As such, this track is a study in rhythmic twists and slight-of-hand harmonic turns, with the added bonus of featuring perhaps the first recorded example of AJ's detuned Fender bass.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"Sleep On It\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nA mid-tempo soulful funk-tinged number that benefits greatly from the contrasts between sections artfully accentuated by the killer rhythm section of Anthony Jackson and Steve Ferrone. AJ also fires off several scintillating runs that light up the track like fireworks above a tropical beach at twilight...\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nChaka Khan - \"I Was Made To Love Him\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nChaka's cover of this Stevie Wonder classic gives Anthony Jackson the chance to show that he's his own man when it comes to interpreting a track that had already been turned into something special by his idol James Jamerson. Check out AJ's masterful use of chromaticism - something that continued to flourish until it became an integral part of his style.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nBilly Idol - \"Dancing With Myself\"\n\nBass: Phil Feit\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nLady Antebellum - \"Need You Now\"\n\nBass: Craig Young\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nMiranda Lambert - \"Gunpowder and Lead\"\n\nBass: Glenn Worf\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nMiranda Lambert - \"White Liar\"\n\nBass: Glenn Worf\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nLittle Big Town - \"Pontoon\"\n\nBass: John Thomasson\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nLoverboy - \"Turn Me Loose\"\n\nBass: Scott Smith\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nReba McEntire - \"Fancy\"\n\nBass: Michael Rhodes\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nReba McEntire - \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\"\n\nBass: Leland Sklar\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nJohn Cougar Mellencamp - \"R.O.C.K. In The U.S.A.\"\n\nBass: Toby Myers\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nAllanah Myles - \"Black Velvet\"\n\nSynth bass: Dave Tyson\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nVan Morrison - \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm In Heaven When You Smile)\"\n\nBass: Bill Church\n\nChurch's hard-swingin' lines perfectly complement Morrison's homage to R&B legend Jackie Wilson (while also showing how to lay down a tasteful and melodic part that fits the song like a glove).\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nLorrie Morgan - \"What Part of No\"\n\nBass: Glenn Worf\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nNickelback - \"Something In Your Mouth\"\n\nBass: Mike Kroeger\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nTed Nugent and the Amboy Dukes - \"No Holds Barred\"\n\nBass: Rob Grange\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nBuddy Rich - \"Billie's Bounce\"\n\nBass: Anthony Jackson\n\nA straight blues outing in which AJ delivers a fine solo while pulling off some of his trademark harmonic twists and turns as he underpins Buddy Rich's band.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nThe Ruts - \"West One (Shine On Me)\"\n\nBass: John \"Segs\" Jennings\n\nThis has long been my favourite Ruts track, not least because it's a great study in how to use inversions to spice up otherwise vanilla harmony: Check out the guitar chords and see how Segs transforms them with his snaking lines - masterful!\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nSaving Abel - \"The Sex Is Good\"\n\nBass: Eric Taylor\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nBob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band - \"Sunspot Baby\"\n\nBass: David Hood\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nThe Shadows - \"Nivram\"\n\nBass: Jet Harris\n\nThough a million miles away from the flash and fireworks of today's bass solos (and solo bassists) Jet Harris was nevertheless the real deal back in the day. And, as an added bonus, he looked cool as all-get-out. Furthermore, this song features what is likely the first ever electric bass solo in a pop setting (1961). Enjoy!\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nShania Twain - \"Any Man of Mine\"\n\nBass: David Hungate\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nShania Twain - \"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\"\n\nBass: David Hungate\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nShinedown - \"Sound of Madness\"\n\nBass: Chris Chaney\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nBruce Springsteen - \"Pink Cadillac\"\n\nBass: Garry Tallent\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nBilly Squire - \"Lonely Is The Night\"\n\nBass: Mark Clark\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nTheory of a Deadman - \"Bad Girlfriend\"\n\nBass: Dean Back\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nTommy Tutone - \"867-5309/Jenny\"\n\nBass: Greg Sutton\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nCarrie Underwood - \"Before He Cheats\"\n\nBass: Mark Hill\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nCarrie Underwood - \"Smoke Break\"\n\nBass: Dave Roe\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nGretchen Wilson - \"Here for the Party\"\n\nBass: Michael Rhodes\n\n\"Going For The One\" is a quintessential Chris Squire classic. His weaving contrapuntal lines and unerring sense of harmonic conviction serve as a spine-tingling master class in melodic inventiveness for bassists of all styles.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nWorld Party - \"Is It Like Today?\"\n\nBass: David Catlin-Birch\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nGretchen Wilson - \"Redneck Woman\"\n\nBass: Michael Rhodes\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nYes - \"Going For The One\"\n\nBass: Chris Squire\n\n\"Going For The One\" is a quintessential Chris Squire classic. His weaving contrapuntal lines and unerring sense of harmonic conviction serve as a spine-tingling master class in melodic inventiveness for bassists of all styles.\n\nStandard notation | Tab version | Comments/Analysis\n\nYes - \"Homeworld (The Ladder)\"\n\nBass: Chris Squire\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nYes - \"Lightning Strikes\"\n\nBass: Chris Squire\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nYes - \"Magnification\"\n\nBass: Chris Squire\n\nA study in cross-rhythms and masterful bass playing.\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nYes - \"Onward\"\n\nBass: Chris Squire\n\nTranscription | Comments/Analysis\n\nYes - \"Parallels\"\n\nBass: Chris Squire\n\nUnlike the contrapuntal creation permeating \"Going For The One,\" in \"Parallels,\" Chris Squire spends a lot of the time locked into a solid repeating groove with drummer Alan White rather than wandering off into his own harmonic world. Indeed, certain parts of \"Parallels\" are groovy enough to give Bootsy himself in-the-pocket palpitations."
