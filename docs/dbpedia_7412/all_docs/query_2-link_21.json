Although they are usually referred to as \"a San Francisco band\", they were actually based in Willits, California at the time that \"Jenny\" was released. The song became so popular that people in the United States to this day dial this telephone number and ask for \"Jenny\" as a prank. Regarding the famous number, \"We had people threatening to sue us. It was the Buffalo Chief of Police's daughter's number in New York,\" said Frontman Tommy Heath. Although they are frequently remembered as a \"one-hit wonder\", they had another top 40 hit on the Hot 100 with \"Angel Say No\" in 1980, predating \"Jenny\" by a couple of years.\n\nA common misconception is that Tommy Tutone is the name of the lead singer; it is actually the name of the band. Tommy Heath is the lead singer. The name of the band developed from the original name \"Tommy and the Tu-tones\" to merely Tommy Tutone.\n\nHeath and Jim Keller founded the band in the late 1970s, with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, also playing keyboards on occasion; Keller playing lead guitar and supporting vocals. Bassist Jon Lyons who replaced original bassist Terry Nails (Steve Jones, Ozzy Osbourne) was later replaced by Greg Sutton, Pete Costello and Jimmy James. Mona Gnader, a member of Sammy Hagar's Waborita band, played with the band as well. Original drummer Mickey Shine (Clover and drummer on the first Elvis Costello album) was replaced by Victor Carberry who in turn was replaced with Jerry Angel. John Cowsill of the Cowsills played drums (and sang) on \"867-5309/Jenny.\" [http://www.cowsill.com/discography/music-john.html] From 2001 onward, the band has consised of Heath,(occasionally Costello) James, Greg Georgeson (guitar) and Andy Gauthier (drums).\n\nTommy Heath now resides in Hudson, Wisconsin.Tommy has been seen playing a Fender Telecaster for most of his career\n\nIn 2007, the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records.\n\nChart positions\n\nDiscography\n\nExternal links"
