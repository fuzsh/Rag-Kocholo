(cat just started his opera when i wrote this, just treat it as an odd thing, remembering the dead and still famous in cinema adaptation)... but you seriously can't imagine Easter in England... chocolate *****, Christianity has become a joke, it hasn't died out, it has just become a joke... what with Elijah becoming a saint rather than a prophet, what with the Archangel Michael also becoming a saint... you'd start thinking: this is getting ridiculous with hen parties and fairy wands, plastic wings and ******* in the alley... the disrespect people have for Easter and over-powering the celebration of Christmas just shows the weakness... a sly incursion into a penitence for the Inquisition... comfortable chairs in churches across America... like i said, a joke. Islam is heading the same way, the failings of these two monotheisms is bound to (as i mentioned already) the incorporation of a polytheistic concept of polytheism bound to the last book before the fiasco, Malachi's promise of a return of Elijah, to turn the son's heart unto his father's, antonym too with the women; well, i have to take this text seriously, i hate ridiculing them, the 20th century's antidote to explaining why the Holocaust wasn't averted by some big brother - i live in England, i'm used to c.c.t.v. voyeurism, i don't understand why a theological c.c.t.v. is so ****** complicated - usually argued by the person with his hand in a cookie jar... why should anyone else be worried? don't worry, i'm not digressing, there's a reason why i added an emphasis title to the first of a sequence of my experiment (where i stop being my own d.j.).\n\nmy father left for England when i was 4,\n\ni do have a vague memory of 1990 -\n\nmost notably my mother waking up late\n\nand in his words: wake the baroness,\n\nlothar matthaus (1990 world cup) -\n\ncarrying a table for the kitchen with him -\n\nmeeting his grandmother that raised him\n\nbeing the oddest experience -\n\n(yeah, he was an unwanted child,\n\nraised by his grandparents,\n\nthe shame stories of his drinking father living\n\nnear him but taking no interest,\n\nhis mother moving to Silesia) -\n\nso from a presence aged 4 to being 8\n\nhe was simply a voice on the telephone\n\nand a pack of presents once in a while -\n\nmy mother left to join him when i was 6 -\n\nbefore she left she bought me a dog,\n\na doberman pinscher - called him Axel\n\n(after Axl Rose) - after that i got a taste\n\nof my father's childhood, i.e. being raised\n\nby my grandparents - driving an industrial\n\nbuggy on the steel plant complex,\n\ntaking a shower in the bathrooms -\n\nmy grandfather was an alcoholic... now i'm\n\na post-stoner alcoholic... so i don't have any\n\nhorror story to name and shame someone,\n\nit doesn't matter, once i walked my grandfather\n\nfrom his mother's house on her birthday,\n\nhe got the woman's wrath from my grandmother\n\nand my mother, but i sure as **** walked him home;\n\njust stating the obvious, not all poets are\n\nfluffy heart frail, some of us learn to live.\n\nso when i arrived in England aged 8 at the Victoria\n\nCoach Station i didn't quiet know what to do\n\nhugging my father... a complete stranger\n\n(early development is not the development of\n\nadults used to the mundane hamster wheels\n\nof countless Mondays and Fridays and nights out) -\n\nmy memory of learning English in primary school\n\nfrom scratch? i can't tell you anything detailed -\n\nwhat i can tell you is that Jurassic Park came out\n\nthat year and i really wanted to see it after\n\nbecoming a fan of the Japanese versions of Godzilla,\n\nmy favourite? *Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster.\n\nand Lion King was out too... each day after coming\n\nback from primary school (fond memories,\n\nlike taking pictures of Pamela Anderson from\n\na newsagent that were given out for free into\n\nthe schoolyard and distributing them, getting ratted\n\nout given the shame-mantra by the headmaster:\n\nwhat would you say if this was your mother?\n\nChristianity is perfect by shaming you first, then\n\nsupposedly redeeming you, their own vice fruit\n\nand that ******* crucifix. the game of bulldog\n\nthe meals, Ribena, choc cake with custard,\n\ndrawing Ophelia drowning for a school exhibition...\n\nthe devil mask bought at Warsaw and worn at\n\na dance ball, having it worn by all too eager friends\n\none by one... the list is endless - as ever, memory,\n\nthe best cinema in town) - so each day after coming\n\nback from primary school i'd watch the Lion King\n\nreligiously... even my mother was bothered,\n\nafter two weeks if not more she complained to me\n\nwith concerns as if i were autistic or something -\n\nwhy was i watching it? think about it... from the age\n\nof 4 to the age of 8 i hadn't seen my father -\n\nbut you know that famous scene when Scar betrays\n\nMufasa and throws him to his death in the stampede?\n\npivotal moment for my psychic life to catch-up\n\nwith having a father - using the fear of loss in bright\n\ncolours kinda illuminated the dull realities around me -\n\nintuitive masterminding what many people will take\n\nfor a standard family life - obviously i stopped the Lion\n\nKing after i saturated enough feeling for a person\n\ni didn't develop around aged 4 till 8... which might\n\nexplain my resorting to alcoholism... but i'm not bothered,\n\ni don't feel like starting a family, plus alcohol\n\nsedates and makes writing more uninhibited (show me\n\na writer who didn't drink and i'll find you a bored\n\nreader and unfinished books, that's the point of the\n\nanti-haiku concept of ens≈ç - i'm counting on it:\n\nwritten without effort, should, technically be read without\n\neffort), and never mind that ****** focal point in\n\nmy life that's not at all interesting aged 21 and thus\n\nwhat happened after; that's me, automaton -\n\nrebellious against being grilled down to:\n\nan Englishman's house is his... cave... Darwinism take\n\non history will continue to be my pet peeve -\n\nit just erases so many advances we've had down the centuries,\n\nplus for every humanism alive... it must be kinda boring -\n\nno... i'm not ensuring Darwinism is sparring in a boxing\n\nring with theology - from human to human -\n\nthat new program on channel 4 (naked attraction)\n\nlooks a bit like a trip to the butchers - and however you think\n\nabout it... the date after still looks ******* awkward,\n\nso the ******* doesn't really help, the situation between\n\nthe pair is still like rubbing sandpaper on your face:\n\nyou're not showing a rouge of minor shame and inhibition...\n\nyou've just been basically *****-slapped silly."
