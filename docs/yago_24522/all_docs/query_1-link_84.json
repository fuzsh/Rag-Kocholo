        "text": "Irving Berlin's 1954 classic, \"White Christmas,\" is coming to Des Moines, bringing actors Lorna Luft and Conrad John Schuck to the local stage.\n\n\"White Christmas\" is the tale of a successful male song-and-dance act that teams up with two sisters to perform a Christmas show in Vermont. The group comes across Gen. Henry Waverly, who knew the men while serving as their commander during World War II.\n\nWaverly's country inn is failing, so the foursome create a musical to get it thriving again. Schuck plays Waverly, while songstress Luft reprises her performance as inn housekeeper Martha Watson, a role she has played on and off for almost 11 years.\n\n\"I love her relationship with the general. I love the fact that she will do anything to protect him,\" Luft said. \"She runs around, protects people, and she's big-hearted and funny, and that's what I love about her.\"\n\nWhen prepping for the show, Luft leaves her dressing room door open so that anyone can come in and know they're welcome.\n\nLuft is the daughter of the late producer Sydney Luft and actress Judy Garland, who had a 45-year career in entertainment. Luft's father helped her mother get a deal with Warner Bros. for her comeback film, \"A Star Is Born,\" which debuted in 1954.\n\nFor Luft, she was born into the world of acting. \"I didn't do anything unusual. I went into the family business, show business,\" Luft said. \"Now if I became a neurosurgeon, that would be a story,\" she jokingly added.\n\nThe topic of Luft being an actress was the big white elephant in the room, according to the 66-year-old. It wasn't talked about among her family, but when Luft ultimately decided to go into the world of entertainment, Garland told her: \"You better go study because you're not getting in on my name.\"\n\nLuft knew that she had to make her footsteps. As the daughter of legendary parents, Luft mentioned that it was something she had to learn how to deal with it and be grateful. Her breakout acting role came at 19 on the Broadway show \"Promises, Promises.\" Luft got a chance to work with Neil Simon, Michael Bennett, and Hal David. Along with \"Promises, Promises,\" 1992's \"Guys and Dolls\" was another primary production for Luft.\n\nOn June 22, 1969, Garland died from a drug overdose of barbiturates in her London hotel. Just 17 years old at the time, Luft remembers helping take care of Garland through difficult patches of her life. She explained to author Patti Davis in 2009 what her duties were in \"The Lives Our Mothers Leave Us.\"\n\n\"It was my responsibility as a kid to regulate her pills. I remember sitting in hotel rooms, opening capsules, emptying the drugs, and filling the capsules with sugar. I was taught to never, ever call an ambulance no matter what happened. I was to call my father or someone else — NEVER an ambulance because it would get into the press.\"\n\nIn an article published by Vanity Fair, Luft's father would dilute some of Garland's prescription pills with sugar to help manage her addiction. While Luft spoke to Davis in 2009 regarding caring for her mother, she penned her memoir years before in 1998 titled \"Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir.\"\n\n\"When you go to write a book about a subject matter that is not fiction, you've got to tell the truth,\" she said. \"I told my story from my point of view, and from how I grew up, I didn't tell anybody else's. If you're going to cash the check, you better make it real.\"\n\nOther responsibilities of being a caretaker for Garland were also included in the book:\n\n\"I learned to go through all of her clothes and the drapes — all the places she'd hide pills — whenever she left the house. It was my job to keep the pills locked up and give her a certain number on schedule. I would count them out, so many of each color, and bring them to her with a glass of water.\"\n\n\"I also had to learn to take care of her when the medications became badly imbalanced, or she overslept and went into withdrawal. When that happened, she'd sometimes pass out, or worse yet, have seizures. ... I might not have spent much time in school during those years, but I learned a great deal more than most teenagers ever have to know.\"\n\nThe New York Times bestseller didn't just reminisce about her mother but channeled her own story of self-love and discovery. When asked what her happiest childhood moment was, Luft explained that she didn't have just one moment. She insisted that life itself has taught her how to live in the moment, not tomorrow. \"I think that comes with age,\" Luft said.\n\nWhile Luft did her best to care for her mother, she too dealt with a battle of drug addiction. How she escaped a leading path of a drug overdose, she said, \"I am sick and tired, feeling sick and tired.\" The mother of two children and grandmother of three grandchildren has been sober for 37 years. \"Now, I understand it's a disease,\" Luft said. \"Some people get to a point where they say, 'I want a life. I want sobriety. I want clarity, and I don't want to feel like this anymore.'\"\n\nFor Luft, she is one of the lucky ones that didn't want to live that life any longer. The actress noted that there are facilities, education, and knowledge about the world of addiction. In her mother's era, there wasn't.\n\nAlong with overcoming a drug addiction, Luft overcame being diagnosed with a brain tumor, according to her spokesperson. Luft collapsed backstage for a concert at Pizza Express Jazz Club in London. Luft was struggling to remember both her lyrics and monologues. She underwent a successful brain surgery to remove the tumor at a Los Angeles hospital. On how she's doing, Luft said she's \"doing great,\" performing 8 shows a week.\n\nIronically starring in Berlin's \"White Christmas,\" Luft said that one of her mother's happiest moments was working with Berlin for \"Easter Parade.\" \"Now for me to be able to be doing 'White Christmas' that was written by Irving Berlin is such a joy because it is such an honor, and it's a family tradition,\" she said.\n\nLuft recounted a moment when she was backstage getting ready for a show. She received a knock on her door with a lady standing there. It was Berlin's daughter Linda Louise Emmet telling her how much Berlin loved Garland. \"I think to myself, how lucky am I? We both have incredible parents; someone is going to be singing their songs and watching their films while they grow up,\" Luft said.\n\nRecently, Garland's film \"Judy\" hit theaters with actress Renée Zellweger playing her. In an interview with \"Good Morning Britain,\" Luft was asked why she wouldn't go see the biopic about her mother. Luft mentioned to the Register that she's protective of her mother's legacy, and fans should see her films, listen to her recordings, and watch her television work.\n\nWhile Luft does her best to protect her mother's legacy, history has already been written. Several outlets, including MSN and Hollywood Reporter, have revisited the topic of blackface, and Garland was included in the conversation. Blackface is the makeup used by a non-black performer playing a black role. In 1938, before Garland appeared in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" she appeared in \"Everybody Sing\" at the age of 16-years-old.\n\nIn the film, she can be seen singing in blackface as a caricature. On this permanent stain engraved in America, England, and the film industry's history, Luft said: \"That was a different time, and you've got to remember the people who did that in film. They didn't write those scenes, and they didn't produce those movies; they were working for hire.\"\n\n\"We know it should never, ever, ever, ever be done again,\" Luft added. \"When it was done, it was done by a lot of people, but they didn't write the scenes. They didn't direct the movie. They did what they were told to do.\"\n\nLuft noted that she and CNN's Don Lemon had talked about blackface, but having gone through history, she hopes that it can be learned, \"you don't do that.\"\n\nOn the legacy she hopes to leave, Luft jokingly said that she wishes she doesn't have to leave one soon. But, Luft would like to leave a legacy of laughter and entertainment.\n\nIf Garland were here to see her daughter perform in \"White Christmas,\" she would \"absolutely adore this show because the show is all about heart, and it's about soldiers.\n\n\"It's about World War II. It's about after the war. It's about love; it's about sisterhood,\" Luft said. For those planning to see \"White Christmas,\" Nov. 19-24, Luft wants you to know that \"you are coming to see a show that is filled with joy and happiness and amazing music that you grew up with.\"\n\nIf you go\n\nWhen: Nov.19-24. Time varies\n\nWhere: Des Moines Civic Center, 221 Walnut St"
