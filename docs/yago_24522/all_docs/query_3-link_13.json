        "text": "Husband number one: David Rose\n\nDavid Rose was an American songwriter, composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader.\n\nHis best-known works were 'The Stripper', 'Holiday for Strings', and 'Calypso Melody'. He also wrote music for various TV shows, including Little House on the Prairie, Bonanza, and Highway Patrol under the pseudonym Ray Llewellyn.\n\nGarland began a relationship with Rose in the early 1940s, and on her 18th birthday, he gave her an engagement ring. Her film studio intervened as he was still married to actress and singer Martha Raye at the time.\n\nThey agreed to wait a year after his divorce became final. During the same time, Garland had a brief affair with songwriter Johnny Mercer. Garland and Rose married on July 27, 1941.\n\nThey had no children, though Garland, according to biographer Gerald Clarke, had at least one abortion during the marriage, at the insistence of her mother, husband, and the studio MGM. They divorced in 1944.\n\nRose died in 1990, aged 80.\n\nHusband number two: Vincente Minnelli\n\nVincent Minnelli was an American stage director and film director. He is best known for directing classic movie musicals such as Meet Me in St. Louis, An American in Paris and Gigi.\n\nDuring the filming of Meet Me in St. Louis, Garland and Minnelli had an initial falling out, but they soon started a relationship and married on June 15, 1945.\n\nIn March 1946, their daughter Liza Minnelli was born, who went on to become an international star herself.\n\nThe couple divorced by 1951. He died in 1986, aged 83.\n\nHusband number three: Sidney Luft\n\nSidney Luft was an American showbusiness figure, who became Garland's tour manager and producer.\n\nSoon after divorcing Minnelli, Garland married Luft in 1952.\n\nGarland gave birth to Lorna Luft, who herself became an actress and singer, in November 1952, and to Joey Luft in March 1955.\n\nIn 1963, Garland sued Luft for divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty. She claimed he had repeatedly hit her while he was drinking. She had filed for divorce from Luft several times before, but they had made up each time. They were finally divorced in 1965.\n\nHe passed away in 2005, aged 89.\n\nActor Rufus Sewell plays Luft in the Judy movie.\n\nHusband number four: Mark Herron\n\nMark Herron was an actor who appeared in films such as Federico Fellini's 8Â½, Girl in Gold Boots and Eye of the Cat.\n\nHe produced her two London Palladium concerts alongside her daughter Liza Minnelli in 1964, as well as some personal appearances in Canada in 1965.\n\nHerron announced the couple had married on a freighter off the coast of Hong Kong, but she was not officially divorced from Luft at the time. They did not legally marry until November 1965.\n\nHowever, they separated just six months later. Garland testified that Herron had beaten her, but he claimed that he \"only hit her in self-defence\".\n\nHerron died of cancer in 1996, aged 67.\n\nHusband number five: Mickey Deans\n\nMickey Deans was an American musician and entrepreneur.\n\nHe is said to have met Garland at her hotel in New York City. A mutual friend of theirs asked Deans to deliver a package of stimulant tablets to the actress.\n\nAs Garland's two youngest children were present at the time, he introduced himself as a doctor.\n\nAfter three years of dating, Deans proposed and they were married in 1969, in London.\n\nHe helped to promote Garland's career towards the end of her life, but he struggled to battle her use of prescription drugs.\n\nDeans tragically discovered Garland dead on June 22, 1969. He said that he found her seated on the toilet, having died from an accidental overdose of barbiturates.\n\nDeans died in 2003, aged 68.\n\nActor Finn Wittrock plays Deans in the Judy movie."
