        "text": "Fifty years after the death of Judy Garland, the star is being reborn via two new films.\n\nIn the biopic “Judy” (in theaters now), Renee Zellweger portrays the fading singer in the dwindling days of her career, performing her final London shows before dying from a barbiturate overdose at age 47.\n\nAnd in the Showtime documentary “Sid & Judy” (Friday, 8:05 PM ET/PT), rare recordings of Garland’s voice, along with passages from her third husband Sidney Luft’s memoir (narrated by Jon Hamm and Jennifer Jason Leigh), are used to paint a picture of the successes and struggles that followed her from child stardom into adulthood.\n\nBoth films answer burning questions about the girl, born Frances Ethel Gumm, who would become the iconic musical star of “The Wizard of Oz” and “A Star Is Born.”\n\nReview: 'Judy' only sings with Renee Zellweger's remarkable Judy Garland\n\n'I am at a really cool age': Renee Zellweger opens up about being 50, playing Judy Garland\n\nHow much of a stage mom was Judy Garland’s mother?\n\nIn “Sid & Judy,” Garland says this in an interview about her mother: “She was truly a stage mother, a mean one (who would say), ‘You get out and sing or I’ll wrap you around the bedpost and break you off short.’ ”\n\nShe continued: \"(My parents) would argue and fight, and my mother would always use me as a pawn.\" By the time Garland's mother, Ethel, died in 1953, \"their relationship had deteriorated so badly,\" according to Luft. Less than two months earlier, Garland had prevented her mother from meeting newborn daughter Lorna.\n\nWhat was Judy's real history with prescription meds?\n\nIn “Judy,” Darci Shaw plays a young Garland who takes appetite-suppressing “pep pills,” and Zellweger shows an adult Garland who swallows pills to help her sleep.\n\nThe star’s real addiction was so serious that as a teenager she was amped on benzedrine to fight exhaustion as she shot musical numbers for Busby Berkeley productions. According to Luft in the documentary, even as an adult, Garland had Tuinal capsules sewn into the lining of robes in an effort to hide her habit. Her drug use led to numerous sick days and at least one near-fatal hospital visit.\n\nHow did her London shows really go?\n\nIn “Judy,” Zellweger plays a Garland who skips rehearsals and stumbles through a final run of Talk of the Town performances in the months leading up to her death. In real life, Garland’s shows did deteriorate over the five-week gig, with her arriving terribly late and getting booed by audiences. The shows were a far cry from Garland’s 1960 London Palladium performance that got raves and was followed in 1961 by a Grammy-winning stint at Carnegie Hall.\n\nWhat happened to Judy’s husbands and children?\n\nThough only two of Garland's husbands, Luft and Mickey Deans, get major airtime in \"Judy\" and \"Sid & Judy,\" she married five times.\n\nHer first husband, Emmy-winning composer David Rose (married 1941-44), who was 12 years Garland’s senior, remarried and died in 1990. Her “Meet Me in St. Louis” director Vincente Minnelli (1945-51), who fathered Liza Minnelli, remarried three more times and died in 1986. Producer Luft (1952-65 and stoically played by Rufus Sewell in “Judy”), who wrote about his relationship with Garland, fathered Lorna and Joey Luft; he married twice more and died in 2005. Actor Mark Herron (1965-69), who had a lengthy relationship with fellow actor Henry Brandon, died in 1996.\n\nShe married her last husband, club promoter Deans (played by a flirty Finn Wittrock in “Judy”), who was 12 years her junior, in 1969. They were married just three months before her death; he died in 2003.\n\nGarland’s kids didn't shy away from show business: Liza Minnelli, 73, has won an Oscar, Emmy and numerous Tony Awards; Lorna Luft, 66, is a singer and actress; and Joey Luft, 64, has also done some performing.\n\nWhy did the LGBTQ community embrace Garland?\n\nIn “Judy,” Garland visits the home of two male fans, and sympathizes with them and their fight for gay rights. That scene was contrived for the movie, but in reality, Garland did become an LGBTQ icon.\n\nIn “Sid & Judy,” real fans – mostly men and women in Dorothy attire – explain their love for Garland at a screening of “The Wizard of Oz”: “She’s timeless.” “She’s the epitome of hope.” “She had a lot of struggles, but she overcame a lot of them.” “She’s an amazing believer in people.” And “she did love the gays. Married a few gays, right?”\n\nWhat did Garland say about the tribulations of fame?\n\nIn Garland’s words, per “Sid & Judy,” being a living legend is “lonesome.”\n\nIn an interview with Jack Paar, she says that it’s “like a Statue of Liberty, or something like that, who doesn’t breathe. And so no one calls you on the phone and asks you to dinner. So I just sit by the phone.”\n\nLater, she says, “I’ve sung, I’ve entertained, I’ve pleased your children, I’ve pleased your wives. &mldr; I tried my damnedest to believe in that rainbow that I tried to get over and I couldn’t. So what!\"\n\nWhere is she buried?\n\nJudy Garland’s remains were transferred from Westchester County, New York, to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in 2017. As shown in \"Sid & Judy,\" the star's arrival was celebrated with a \"Wizard of Oz\" screening at the cemetery on what would've been the star's 95th birthday."
