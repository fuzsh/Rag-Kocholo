        "text": "Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Producer Sid Luft, who is credited with reviving the career of then-wife Judy Garland in the 1950s, died Thursday. He was 89.\n\nLuft, whose credits include \"Kilroy was Here\" (1947), \"French Leave\" (1948) and \"A Star is Born\" (1954), died in Santa Monica of an apparent heart attack, according to John Kimble, a longtime friend and business partner.\n\nLuft and Garland were married in 1952 and divorced a tumultuous 13 years later. The marriage was Garland's third and Luft's third.\n\nThey had two children together, Lorna in 1952 and Joey in 1955. Luft was stepfather to singer-actress Liza Minnelli.\n\nLuft was credited with helping resurrect Garland's career after she was released from her contract at MGM in 1950 following a series of personal and professional crises."
