        "text": "Sid & Judy\n\nJudy Garland. We love her. We love Judy & Liza & Lorna & Joey.\n\nJudy Garland. For fans across the globe, the mere mention of her name can make their heart palpitate and their brain spark with the sound of her voice, her life, her rise to fame, and her downfall until her untimely death in 1969.\n\nBut what is the legacy of Sid Luft? Judy and Sid's infrequently explored relationship gets its voice in the new Documentary \"Sid & Judy\", a Passion Pictures Production distributed by Showtime Documentary Films.\n\nNow playing the Film Festival circuit, \"Sid & Judy\" is a keenly-awaited story of the father of Lorna and Joey Luft, Judy Garland's third husband Sid Luft, and his relationship with Judy. It features rare audio of phone calls Sid took from CBS producers during the time Judy had her short-lived television show, as well as a few others. It contains recently released writings from Sid Luft's memoirs read in the first person by actor John Hamm (\"Mad Men\") and another first person narrative of Judy by Jennifer Jason Leigh (\"Patrick Melrose\"). Also included are archival footage and photos of Luft and Garland (concert and otherwise), along with excerpts from the unbridled and infamous \"Judy Garland Memoir Recordings.\" \"Sid & Judy\" promises to be \"... a poignant portrait of a woman whose vulnerabilities were exploited by an industry she helped build ...\".\n\nOut of the gate, \"Sid & Judy\" hits the road hard like a well-seasoned touring performer. It's archive footage, photos, audio and illustrations are the highest points of its strengths. A top-of-the-credits acknowledgment (and well deserved at that) goes to archive producer Adele Sparks and her team of archivists. Sparks and the rest gather images and footage from no less than about 50+ sources - some well-known, some not. Surprisingly though, some of the only \"family\" archive sources is Sid Luft's estate: Not those of Lora or Joey. Beautiful illustrations by David Navas, and animations by artist Sebastian Hoppe give this music doc stylistic vitality while moving the story along. The documentary also addresses Judy's love for the gay community and their love for her. Little did she know that her death would act as a catalyst moving the gay rights movement forward at an accelerated velocity. Or maybe she did.\n\nThis viewer is a bit confused, though. \"Sid & Judy\" is directed by Stephen Kijak, who is known for at least seven other musical documentaries, works about such groups as the Backstreet Boys, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and more. Kijak misses the mark on the exact story he's telling. By the end of \"Sid & Judy\", he strays off his course. Losing the focus on the relationship with Sid & Judy, it relies too much on a story we already know: The story of Judy's Studio-inspired drug addiction, and her death and downfall. It spends too long of an amount of time on the backstory of Judy's childhood, losing its detailed look into Sid and Judy's relationship at the end of their marriage. Joey Luft has worked hard at staying out of the public eye, but where is Lorna in this?\n\nAlso, it was an interesting overall choice not to show Liza and others' soundbites onscreen. Were the producers afraid of tipping their hand that this might have been too old of footage to show, or are they just trying to level the playing field? Also, although a commendable performance by Hamm and Leigh, having actual voiceover from Luft and Garland, then \"acted\" voiceover as Luft and Garland get confusing. Kijak also chooses to use colorized archival footage, pulling the viewer out of the reality of Judy's time period. Finishing completely off the path by the end, the film's credit sequences shows clips of adoring fans from the recent party held at Hollywood Forever Cemetery where Judy's new resting place lies. Nice, but unnecessary.\n\nThat's not what this documentary should've been. We know Judy is well-loved by the LGBT community. Sid Luft in his memoirs wanted to tell his story of himself and Judy Garland. \"Sid & Judy\" tells some of that story, but falls short in the story it wants to tell â€“ a story that goes from love affair, confidants, managers, and loss; but most importantly a deeper look into the humanization of someone mostly just known as Judy's third husband and the father of two of her children."
