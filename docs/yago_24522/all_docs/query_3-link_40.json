        "text": "American actress and singer (born 1952)\n\nLorna Luft (born November 21, 1952) is an American actress and singer. She is the daughter of Judy Garland and Sidney Luft, the sister of Joey Luft and the half-sister of Liza Minnelli.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLuft was born on November 21, 1952, at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California to Judy Garland and Garland's third husband, Sidney Luft.[1] She attended University High School in Los Angeles during her senior year and was a member of the school choir. She studied theatre at HB Studio[2] in New York City.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nStage and television\n\n[edit]\n\nLuft made her show business debut at age 11, singing \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" on the 1963 Christmas episode of Garland's CBS television series The Judy Garland Show. Siblings Liza Minnelli and Joey Luft also appeared. Garland sang the song \"Lorna\" to Luft on episode 20 of The Judy Garland Show in 1964: an original number composed by Mort Lindsey and Johnny Mercer especially for Luft at Garland's request. The song was later featured on the 2006 Garland compilation Great Day! Rare Recordings from the Judy Garland Show.\n\nLuft soon joined the family act on a summer concert tour, the highlight of which was Garland's third and final appearance at New York's famed Palace Theatre on Broadway in 1967, two years before her mother's death.[3] In this month-long engagement, Garland \"shared\" the bill with Luft (then 14 years old) and Joey (12 years old). The show was recorded live and released on ABC Records as Judy Garland at Home at the Palace.[4]\n\nLuft made her Broadway debut in 1971 at the Shubert Theatre as a replacement cast member in the musical Promises, Promises, adapted from the classic 1960 Billy Wilder film The Apartment.[5] It is best known for the hit song \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\".\n\nOn October 7, 1981, Luft performed at Carnegie Hall in New York, which was said to be the culmination of a lifelong dream. She starred in the 1981–82 national tour of They're Playing Our Song, and in 1982 she played Paulette Rebchuck in Grease 2. In 1983, she played Peppermint Patty in the off-Broadway production of Snoopy! The Musical, a sequel to You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.[6] Later that year, she costarred in Extremities with Farrah Fawcett.[8]\n\nLuft appeared as Nurse Libby Kegler on the CBS television series Trapper John, M.D. during its final season of 1985–1986. She also appeared as Patti Bristol in \"Broadway Malady\", a 1985 episode of Murder, She Wrote. In the episode, Luft played the daughter of Vivian Blaine, who had originated the role of Adelaide in Guys and Dolls on Broadway, while Luft would go on to play the same role in the 1992–1994 national and worldwide tours.\n\nIn 1996, Luft appeared in an Irish production of Follies in Dublin with Mary Millar, Alex Sharpe, Christine Scarry, Aidan Conway, Enda Markey, Dave Willetts and Millicent Martin. In 2002, she starred as Mama Rose in a University of Richmond school production of Gypsy.\n\nIn December 1995, Luft released a cover version of \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", which was reworked as a \"virtual duet\" with Garland. Produced by Gordon Lorenz, it was issued as a CD single only in the U.K. by the Carlton Sounds label. A music video featured Luft performing the song in a studio interspersed with classic footage of Garland singing to a then-11-year-old Luft on the 1963 Christmas episode of The Judy Garland Show, all placed on the same screen.[9]\n\nFrom November 2006 through January 2007, Luft performed in the U.K. premiere of Irving Berlin's White Christmas, a new stage adaptation based on the film. She reprised her role the next year, playing the Edinburgh Playhouse from November 19 to December 8, 2007, and the Wales Millennium Centre at the Donald Gordon Theatre from December 13, 2007, through January 12, 2008.\n\nLuft appeared in four episodes of the 2007–2009 Logo animated series Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World.\n\nIn October 2007, Luft released her debut album Lorna Luft: Songs My Mother Taught Me in the U.K.[10] Produced by Barry Manilow and Luft's husband Colin R. Freeman, the album celebrates Garland's music. To promote the album, Luft appeared on the 29th October 2007 edition of the Ken Bruce Show on BBC Radio 2. She took part in Celebrity Popmaster. In 2005, Luft toured Ireland with her stage show, Songs My Mother Taught Me. In June 2006, she surprised audiences at Carnegie Hall by performing a duet with Rufus Wainwright on the song \"After You've Gone\" at the end of Wainwright's tribute concert for Garland's triumphant 1961 comeback at the same venue.\n\nLuft appeared in The Wizard Of Oz, a stage version of the movie that made Garland famous, at The Lowry in Manchester, England. She portrayed the role of the Wicked Witch of the West (played by Margaret Hamilton in the film).\n\nIn April 2009, Luft completed a successful U.K. tour of the critically acclaimed Hugh Whitemore play Pack of Lies, where she played the role of Helen Kroger, starring alongside Jenny Seagrove, Simon Shepherd, and Daniel Hill. In May 2009 she appeared in W magazine as a special guest performer for the acclaimed avant-garde Theo Adams Company's latest project, \"Performance\", photographed by David Sims.[11] In July 2009, she appeared at the Mermaid Theatre, London to record for the radio series Friday Night Is Music Night. Lorna Luft and Friends – A Tribute to Judy Garland also featured John Barrowman, Frances Ruffelle, and Linzi Hateley.\n\nBetween May and July 2015, Luft toured the U.K. in Judy - The Songbook of Judy Garland, a show highlighting Garland's life and music. The show featured her signature songs and recreations of film scenes from her MGM years.\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nLuft has appeared in the films Grease 2 (1982), Where the Boys Are '84 (1984), Fear Stalk (1989), 54 (1998) and My Giant (1998). She and her brother Joey made cameo appearances in the 1963 film I Could Go On Singing.\n\nAuthor\n\n[edit]\n\nLuft is the author of the 1998 book Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir. Among its revelations is the fact that she had an affair with Barry Manilow in 1971.[12] In 2001, the book was adapted as an Emmy-winning TV miniseries titled Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows. It stars Judy Davis as the adult Judy, Tammy Blanchard as the teenage Judy, Hugh Laurie as Vincente Minnelli, Victor Garber as Sid Luft, and Marsha Mason as Ethel Gumm. Luft is the co-author, along with film historian Jeffrey Vance, of the 2018 book A Star Is Born: Judy Garland and the Film That Got Away, which she states is \"a vivid account of the film classic's production, loss, and reclamation.\"[13]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLuft participates in events which are held by various children's and AIDS-related charities, including the annual Los Angeles AIDS Walk and The Children's Wish Foundation International.[14] Luft and her first husband Jerry Mamberg, also known as Jake Hooker, divorced in 1993. They had two children together, a son, Jesse, a daughter, Vanessa, and have four grandchildren.[15] She currently resides in Palm Springs, California, with her second husband, the British-born composer and arranger, Colin Freeman.[16][17]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nLuft was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and she finished her last chemotherapy treatment in 2013. Two years later, the U.K. tour of Judy - The Songbook of Judy Garland concluded early on July 11, 2015 and she returned to the U.S. for surgical treatment following a re-emergence of the breast cancer.[18][19]\n\nIn March 2018, Luft was diagnosed with a brain tumor after she collapsed following a performance in London.[20] Later that month, Luft underwent successful surgery to remove the tumor.[21]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Label 2007 Songs My Mother Taught Me First Night Records\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single Label 1973 \"Our Day Will Come\" b/w \"Is It Really Love At All\" Epic 1978 \"Head Over Heels\" b/w \"I Did It All For Love\" Private Stock 1981 \"Long Time\" b/w \"Something's Got A Hold On My Heart\" DJM Records \"Get It Up\" b/w \"A Few Dollars More\" Silver Blue Records 1984 \"Where the Boys Are\" (with Village People) b/w \"Prove Me Wrong\" \"The Whole World's Goin' Crazee\" b/w \"Jesse's Theme\" 1989 \"Born Again\" b/w \"Born Again (instrumental)\" Dessca Records 1995 \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" (with Judy Garland) Carlton Sounds 2011 \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" Silver Blue Records\n\nSoundtracks\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Label Songs 1982 Grease 2: Original Soundtrack Recording RSO\n\n\"Score Tonight\"\n\n\"Girl for All Seasons\"\n\n\"Who's That Guy?\"\n\n\"Reproduction\"\n\n\"Rock-A-Hula-Luau (Summer Is Coming)\"\n\n\"We'll Be Together\"\n\n1990 Girl Crazy (cast soundtrack) Elektra\n\n\"Sam and Delilah\"\n\n\"I Got Rhythm\"\n\n\"I Got Rhythm\" (Encore) (with Dick Hyman)\n\n\"Finale: Act I\"\n\n\"Boy!
