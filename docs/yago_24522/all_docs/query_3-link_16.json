        "text": "Though they ran in the same circles in Hollywood, Judy Garland and producer Sid Luft didn't officially meet until 1950, when friends introduced them at a Manhattan nightclub. The fell for each almost immediately, despite the fact that Luft was going through a divorce and Judy was married to director Vincente Minnelli (Liza's father). In the excerpt below, from Luft's posthumously published autiobiography (Chicago Review Press; Mar. 1, 2017), Luft shares an intimate account of the first days of their budding affair — a romance that would lead to a 13-year marriage (Garland's longest), two children, and a resurgence in Garland's career at the hands of Luft's management.\n\nIt was the sort of affair that usually blows up, doesn't work out. Judy and I had enjoyed our short time together in New York in September 1950, but once I was back in Los Angeles I kept waiting for things to swerve in another direction or dissolve. That didn't happen.\n\nThe day I returned home from the Man o' War shoot in Saratoga, my lawyer friend Bob Agins called: apparently, Judy had been calling his office while I was away. She was interested in the date of my return. I remarked to Agins, \"I'm back.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"That's right, you're back.\"\n\nWe both understood the implications behind someone like Judy Garland tracking me down. I knew I was not going to play hard to get, as I was too smitten. I couldn't help but wonder how the continued affections of someone as famous as Judy would affect me. A woman who resembled a made-up little girl, who could not go out in public without creating a traffic jam, could not drop into Schwab's for toiletries, for whom a department store was out of the question and a walk was near impossible. And it had been this way for her for many years. An ordinary life was out of the question for Judy Garland. Where would I swim in the fishbowl?\n\nCelebrating following Judy\\'s concert at the L.A. Philharmonic Auditorium, April 21, 1952.\n\nThe paradox of her appearance was profound. She may have looked like a youngster, but she was not. If people treated her as though they were dealing with a little girl, Judy was hostile to them. She might employ the little-girl role with nurses, maids, accountants, but should they be taken off guard, respond too familiarly to her, Judy would quickly let them know they were out of line. She suffered strangers' familiarity. It was, \"Hey, Judy you know we love you,\" like she was the girl next door. But she wasn't. And it was not until many years later that, like the Tennessee Williams character Blanche DuBois, Judy would be forced to rely on the kindness of strangers.\n\n\" If people treated her as though they were dealing with a little girl, Judy was hostile to them.\"\n\nThat night Judy's personal assistant Tully rang me to inquire if I was free to meet Judy. The star evidently did not want to taste the least possibility of rejection—she was not going to deal with me directly. The contact would once again have to be set up by someone else, filtered. Dottie did her hair and makeup, someone would get the gloves, the perfume, and Tully would send her out for the conquest. This time our rendezvous was to be at the Villa Nova, a cafe on the Sunset Strip. The bar was conveniently near Evanview, where Judy and Vincente and Liza lived in a charming three-tier house hanging off the hill.\n\nThe chauffeur dutifully delivered Judy to the dark, comfortable saloon on an evening that was heavy with night-blooming jasmine. Judy made her entrance in slacks, Capezio slippers, a fresh gardenia tucked behind her tiny ear, looking all of sixteen. I was immediately warmed by her presence. \"La Vie en Rose\" melted out of the jukebox. She greeted me with a solid kiss on the mouth, plus a hug.\n\nOutside the Palace Theatre in New York City, Nov. 16, 1951\n\nWe ordered spaghetti and a Caesar salad. She sipped a Canadian Club with ginger ale and I drank a bourbon and water. It was definitely the age of the martini, but I preferred bourbon for the long haul. Judy sipped. I drank.\n\nRight away she asked me about Saratoga. I told her how the jockeys had argued over what horse to ride and I couldn't get it through their heads that it didn't matter, that this wasn't an actual race. The entire shoot cost $18,000. The horse representing Man o' War looked good. I was encouraged, confident that I was right about this project.\n\nOn our second meeting, I waited for her on a corner in Evanview in my black teardrop job, the Cadillac I had bought from Carlton Alsop, lightly tapping the horn to signal her. Once more we were having a wonderful lark together at the expense of Vincente. Judy would tell him, \"Don't ask me where I'm going, I'm just leaving.\" That was her attitude: \"Go f**k yourself.'\"\n\nSid Luft and Judy Garland, circa 1960.\n\nJudy, Sid, and Liza Minnelli in 1954.\n\nAs the days went on, our relationship blossomed; Judy and I got closer and closer. We were developing an ease of communication. Tully would reach me by phone, and then Judy would come on the line. \"What are you doing?\" \"Where are you going, are you all right? I got a joke, a new one . . .\" And she would tell me a joke, something Jack Benny had told her, or Frank Sinatra, or Ethel Merman.\n\n\"We were having a wonderful lark together at the expense of Vincente [Minnelli].\"\n\nPart of me didn't like myself for those secret night rendezvous. I was conventional, egotistical. In New York it had been all in the open, but now I felt I didn't need a sub rosa affair with a married woman. But they continued. My pleasure at going into dark bars with Judy Garland surprised even me. I listened to her playful, witty words, falling with expert timing over gobs of marinara sauce and cigarettes. I began to think I'd never been so amused by a woman in my life. I could hardly wait to go up the hill and honk the horn.\n\nOne night she flew out of the house into the car on the run from Vincente. He'd had a few extra martinis, and he was violent. \"I can't take it anymore.\"\n\nOn the set of \\'A Star Is Born,\\\n\nI didn't say, \"Get out, come live with me.\" Instead, we returned to our safe, dark booth at the Villa Nova to eat, drink, and talk. A naturally exuberant personality, Judy enjoyed telling stories, comic observations. She'd tell me \"safe\" tales of her childhood. One of them concerned her first experience performing onstage. The anecdote has been referred to in other books, but the way she told it when she recorded the incident years later was very close to what I remembered her telling me at the Villa Nova:\n\nI suffered awful ear infections, one after the other from the day I was born. They didn't have any kind of medicine, miracle drugs, so they would simply take me to the hospital or the doctor's office. I'd be strapped to a table and have my ears lanced. And then I'd be smacked onto the couch at my house after being brought home the same day, and with a pair of my father's socks full of hot salt draped over both ears. I looked very much like a cocker spaniel. I couldn't hear much of anything and also I didn't have an awful lot to say, because nobody said anything to me. I was actually silent until my [maternal] grandmother put me onstage . . .\n\n[My grandmother's] black Irish side got awfully angry at my mother for some reason and decided to make a dress for this orphan called Frances who had not uttered one word, not said, \"Mama,\" \"Dada,\" or anything else. My grandmother got so damn mad at her daughter she made me a fancy white net dress and bought me a pair of black patent leather shoes, gave me a little bell, and without an orchestration, without anyone to sing with, she threw me onto my father's stage.\n\nI'd been sitting on my grandmother's lap in the audience, and my two sisters were on the stage performing; they were old pros by then. They'd been appearing at the New Grand for years. And, my grandmother said, \"Go on baby, go up on the stage.\" I rushed to my mother in the pit, and she said not tonight, next week. I ignored her and went onstage [interrupting my sisters]. All I did was run around in circles with a dinner bell singing \"Jingle Bells.\" Everybody started applauding. I liked it and I stayed there singing one chorus after the other. My mother was howling with laughter as she kept playing [piano]. My father was in the wings saying, \"Come on, baby, you get off.\" I couldn't hear my father. I'm so pleased that the first words from my guts and my head and my heart [\"Jingle Bells\"] was as big then as it is today.\n\nI guess I fell in love with the lights, and the music and the whole thing and anyway they couldn't get me off. My father finally came out and got me over his shoulder as I rang the bell, still singing \"Jingle Bells\" into the wings. I was a big hit, so we became the Gumm Sisters.\n\nIt was the first communication I had ever known with people. My first communication was with an audience that approved of me—that's why I sang seventeen choruses.\n\n\"As much as I was attracted to Judy, I reminded myself: here was another self-involved actress.\"\n\nAt two in the morning the manager of the Villa Nova would lock the door; in this way Judy and I remained opposite one another in our private, padded world. We laughed a lot and she continued to be interested in my life, what I had to say, my bullshit. In this way she opened up to me too, and we began to share our lives near the jukebox at the Villa Nova. Judy indicated she had tax problems, but the word \"broke\" never entered the conversation. When she described her hospitalization it was as though she'd been making a movie, visiting crippled children and servicemen.\n\nAt home in Chelsea, London, with Liza, Lorna, and Joe.\n\nFrom left: Liza Minnelli, Lorna Luft, Sid Luft, Judy Garland, and Joe Luft.\n\nJudy was extremely knowledgeable about the making of films, producing, and directing, but it wasn't in her mind to take on those responsibilities. Women just didn't. There was another factor, too: Judy's notions of herself as a femme fatale, and as a woman who was dependent on men, were essential to her romantic self-image.\n\nI'd go back to my apartment and think, do I want to get involved? Judy and Vincente's marriage was rocky. She was looking for romance. I doubted she would break away from Vincente without a replacement. As much as I was attracted to Judy, I reminded myself: here was another self-involved actress. I wanted to make love to Judy, but I was reluctant to act on the impulse. I did not want to fall in love with a married woman; it seemed chancy. Chances were for horses. I figured I could have an affair with Judy if I wasn't actually in love with her. (I'd find a way.)"
