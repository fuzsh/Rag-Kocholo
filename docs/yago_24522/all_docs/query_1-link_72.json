        "text": "At 37, Judy Garland was near death, thanks to alcohol and pills. Her acting-and-singing career had already ﬂatlined. Then, defying doctors’ orders, the star threw everything she had into a 1961 Carnegie Hall performance that became a moment in time for those who were there, and a showbiz legend for everyone else.\n\nIn December 1959, Judy Garland, only 37 but with a quarter-century of hard living behind her, lay near death in New York’s Doctors Hospital. Alcohol and pills were the culprits. When in reasonably good health, Garland, who stood an inch under five feet, weighed 100 pounds. Now she weighed 180. Her tiny frame was grotesquely swollen with fluid and her liver severely compromised. Her eyes were glazed; her memory was failing; her body was shutting down. Walking by Garland’s hospital room, a close friend overheard a clutch of doctors discussing her condition. One of them turned to the friend. “I have to tell you the truth,” the doctor said. “I don’t think she’s going to make it.” She made it. “She had the constitution of an army,” Garland’s daughter Lorna Luft says. “She just knew she had to keep going.” But three weeks later, after 20 quarts of fluid had been drained from her body, her lead physician told Garland, “For the rest of your life, all your physical activity must be curtailed. You are a permanent semi-invalid.… It goes without saying that under no circumstances can you ever work again.” Garland fell back onto her pillows. “Whoopee!” she cried, weakly.\n\nAfter I was thrown out of Metro, I really went to pieces for a while,” Garland told Life writer Shana Alexander in 1961. “All I wanted to do was eat and hide . . . . When I worked, I suffered agonies of stage fright. People had literally to push me out on stage.” Garland had spent much of the 50s, under the guidance of her third husband (and manager), Sid Luft, doing concerts on the road, “singing for my supper,” as she put it. It was a long haul. But when she was able to get through a show, she was a stupendous performer. “She just had that ability to completely enthrall you—even when you didn’t like her, which I didn’t,” says the actress and singer Polly Bergen, who was once married to Garland’s agent Freddie Fields. “There’s no way to describe her capacity for opening herself, as what I would call an acting singer.’ It’s really all about your life experience that you use in a song. But she just went so deep and so open, and of course her life experience was so horrific. It was devastating to watch her. The exhilaration of the high times, and the devastation of the low times, was just mind-blowing. If anyone else did what she did, you would call it extreme overacting. But when she did it, it was true and honest and real. Because her life was overacting.” As the myth of Garland had grown, the record crowds that came to see and hear her were drawn by a combination of awe and morbid curiosity. And for a while the crowds had come: in 1956 she was able to command $55,000 a week at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. But at the same time, she was deeply in debt. She owed the I.R.S.; she owed her interior decorator; she owed everybody. Garland and Luft were equally to blame. She possessed zero business sense, and the beefy, natty, combative Sid—who had first dazzled Garland romantically much as the prizefighter Marcel Cerdan had impressed Edith Piaf: with his fistic skill—hadn’t much more. Addicted to racetrack gambling and expensive, custom-made English suits and shoes, Sid Luft spent his wife’s earnings almost as fast as they came in. He loved her in his fashion, and when she wasn’t manic or comatose or threatening suicide or accidentally setting the house on fire, he worked hard to see to her needs, but she was beyond high-maintenance, and he compensated himself. [#image: /photos/56cc4c4dae46dea861df136b]|||||| <a href=\"/hollywood/features/2000/04/judy-garland-excerpt-200004\">• A selection from Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland (Gerald Clarke, April 2000) <a href=\"/hollywood/features/2002/03/judy-garland-200203\">• Liza Minnelli channels her mother’s dark years (Jonathan Van Meter, March 2002) Luft’s career plan for his genius wife was: Cherchez le paycheck. It was less a strategy than a formula for riding Garland into the ground. And as the 50s ended, as she gained weight and lost altitude, the ground seemed to be just where she was headed. Andrew Velez, a devout Garland fan for many years, recalled a concert she had done at the old Metropolitan Opera House in May 1959: “She was not in good voice, and she was pretty chubby and wearing some purple kind of robe—it looked like a shiny purple bathrobe.” Of course, she wasn’t in good voice; she was dying. Amazing, then, to think that in less than two years both Garland and her career would be revived in spectacular fashion.\n\nAfter weathering her physical crisis, Garland spent much of the first part of 1960 living and resting in London, as far from Hollywood as possible, and without Luft. (After innumerable reconciliations and separations, the couple would finally divorce in 1965.) Toward the end of the summer, Sid came over and found her revivified and excited about the possibility of singing again. But Luft had tired of pushing his wife’s waning career. He had a business scheme of his own, a plan to put in-flight music systems on commercial airliners, and while he pursued it, he decided Judy should have an agent. The man he brought over to London to meet with her was named Freddie Fields. Fields was handsome, charming, and young—not yet 40—and a rising vice president at the powerhouse agency Music Corporation of America (MCA), but he was itching to go out on his own. His idea was to start a boutique agency, with just a dozen superstar clients he could give his personal attention. The only problem was, he didn’t have any superstars yet. He needed one to attract others, and he needed one who needed him. No one fit the bill better than Judy Garland.\n\nIn January 1961, Fields and his new partner, a fellow MCA refugee named David Begelman, laid out for an eagerly receptive Garland what she had never had before: a grand plan. According to Garland biographer Gerold Frank, the stratagem, which would begin with a cross-country concert tour, was as follows: 1) Prove to the entertainment community that Judy Garland was anxious to work … and could be relied upon. That meant, establish her credibility by seeing that she made every personal appearance scheduled, first in cities like Buffalo or Albany, where, if she did fail to show, it would not be so great a calamity; then, later, in major cities. 2) Make her again the most important attraction in the nightclub field, in Florida, Vegas, Tahoe. 3) Then re-establish her importance as a motion-picture actress. First the tour. “Just give her a stage and a spotlight,” Harold Arlen said, “and get out of the way.” City after city, it was the same show every night, beautiful in its simplicity: just Judy onstage, minus the clown and tramp costumes she’d worn during the bad old days of the 50s, and without the chorus boys who had accompanied her. Just Judy, her conductor, Mort Lindsey, a band, and some two dozen of her signature songs. “Act One: Judy,” the program read. “Act Two: More Judy.” The tour went well from the beginning. It helped that she had more or less cleaned up her act: all she drank was a sweet German wine called Blue Nun. As for pills, “I don’t think she took drugs at all,” Mort Lindsey, now 88, tells me. Lorna Luft begs to differ, gently: “She was as sober as she could be. Instead of two or three Dexedrine, there was one.” Actually, it was probably Ritalin, but why split hairs? She was clear-eyed and vertical. Garland was still plump, but the crowds that came to see her in Buffalo and Atlanta and Birmingham didn’t care: they were crazy about her. She felt it, and gave as good as she got. “Her pipes were never better,” Variety wrote of her Dallas show. And in Houston, two nights later: “Unquestionably the greatest show ever given in Houston.” “Listen, Everybody Wanted to Go”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., in early April, she played Constitution Hall, then she and Sid (who’d joined her on the road for their son Joey’s sixth birthday) visited John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office. This was during the bright early days of his presidency. Judy, who’d first met J.F.K. years before through her friend and old MGM co-star Peter Lawford, had hit it off with him from the start. “They remained close even after Kennedy’s inauguration,” wrote Garland biographer Gerald Clarke, “Judy frequently telephoning the White House to ask the President’s advice on how to deal with the difficult people in her life. Kennedy, for his part, sometimes called her for a private concert—a few bars of Over the Rainbow’ sung a cappella over the phone.” Then on to New York. Driving Dallas and Houston and Birmingham audiences crazy was all well and good; Carnegie Hall was something else again. The New York house would be packed with show-business people, coming not just out of affection and morbid curiosity but—whether it was acknowledged or not—to see if she was fit to rejoin the fold. “Listen, everybody wanted to go,” Polly Bergen tells me. “It was like the big event. She’d been gone, and her career was over. Nobody really understands. Her career was over. Nobody wanted to see her. Nobody wanted to put up with her. Nobody cared. I’m talking about nobody in the Business. And let’s face it, the Business is what creates the business. So if people in the Business didn’t care, nothing was going to happen.” Even Garland’s own record label wasn’t sure. Alan Livingston, the president of Capitol, was known for taking bottom-line gambles if an artistic payoff was likely: after all, he was the man responsible for signing Frank Sinatra in 1953, when Sinatra’s career was D.O.A. Lately, though, Livingston’s wager on Garland wasn’t looking so smart. And so when Freddie Fields went to him with the idea of recording the Carnegie Hall concert, Livingston balked. “I didn’t really know whether I wanted to spend the money,” he told Garland chronicler John Fricke. “But I must give Freddie Fields credit, because he was on my back about it: Alan, you’re crazy. You’ve got to do this.’ ” Livingston’s widow, Nancy Olson Livingston, recalls that Garland had become not just a business liability but, because of her emotional whipsaws, a personal challenge to the Capitol president. “You could not get her into a studio,” she says. “So that, even though it was daring to do it live, it was the only way to [record Garland], was what he thought.”\n\nThe evening of April 23, 1961, was warm and drizzly; the crowd started gathering in front of Carnegie Hall hours before the 8:30 P.M. curtain time. The concert had sold out within hours after a small ad, with a David Stone Martin drawing of Garland, appeared in The New York Times. Many of the faithful were gay men, a key component of her audience since the beginning. “I almost got there the day before, because I couldn’t sleep,” says Garland devotee Frank Crapanzano. “I knew everybody there on the street, because they were the same people who followed her around everywhere.” He recalls that when the crowd spotted a limo with Garland in the backseat, her hair in curlers, they ran, en masse, to the stage door. “Then she got out of the car, and people just screamed and clapped and carried on.” The Judy Garland who stepped out of the car was calm and healthy. “The thing was that she looked good,” says filmmaker Steve Lippman, who’s making a documentary, Stay All Night, about the concert. “The building of confidence between the performer and the audience happened before she even stepped onstage.” “You will hear the stories about Oh, she was terrified backstage—she was in an iron lung, and they got a dwarf to tease her out of the iron lung, because dwarves cracked her up,’ ” John Fricke says. In reality, she was all business. When producer Andy Wiswell asked Garland if she could tell her drummer to keep the sound level down for the sake of the recording equipment, she gave him both barrels. “She said,” Mort Lindsey remembers, laughing, “ Listen, you motherfucker, this is my night, and I don’t care if you get a recording. I’m going to get it the way I want it. If I want the drums loud, they’re going to be loud.’ ” She knew exactly what she was doing. As all 3,165 ticket holders filed in, and then for a good long time afterward, Garland sat in her dressing room, biding her time. “Eight-thirty, no Judy,” recalls Mike Nichols, who was in a box with Elaine May, Richard Burton (then starring in Camelot on Broadway) and his wife, Sybil, and Roddy McDowall, among others. “Eight forty-five, no Judy. Suddenly, this guy bursts in and says, She wants Roddy.’ ” Was Garland imploding? Nothing like it. “Roddy McDowall, who had been a friend of hers, told me quite simply that he went backstage, and she wasn’t a wreck,” Fricke says. “She just wanted to see a familiar face and talk to somebody before going on.” “Judy knew how to milk an audience,” Mort Lindsey says. “I see her standing in the wings. She’s not doing anything, just looking across the stage. She’s looking at me and I’m looking at her. I look in the audience, and there’s Ethel Merman and Rock Hudson and Benny Goodman, all these big shots sitting down in the first row, waiting and waiting. Is she going to come out? Is she going to do it? But she knows what she’s doing. Finally she gives me a nod, and I start the overture.” “Mort had a wonderful overture, which built up in tremendous excitement,” Shana Alexander recalled. “And it just built, and it got bigger and bigger. And by that time Judy was standing backstage, and she would grab the curtain. And as the drums were going, she would yell at the audience, Fuck ’em! Fuck ’em! Fuck ’em!’ And she seemed to sort of blow up like a balloon in a Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade—she would inflate! And then, at the last explosion of the chords, she would just sail out onto the stage; it was like she was a pull toy—she was on a string, and she would glide out. And you would hear roars of applause.” The comedian Alan King, who had opened for Garland in the late 50s, was sitting next to Harold Arlen, who’d written the music for many of the songs she would sing at Carnegie Hall that night—including “Over the Rainbow.” Just before Garland came out, King remembered, Arlen asked him, “Have you seen Judy?” But then Garland emerged and went into her first number, “When You’re Smiling,” and pump-walked—step-touch, step-touch—down toward the front of the stage. Arlen looked at King and said dryly, “I think we’re in good shape tonight.” < h4>“I Just Remember That Our Jaws Dropped”\n\nThe audience, stars and civilians alike, agreed. “Everybody loved Judy Garland, and I liked her, but I wasn’t obsessed with her,” Mike Nichols says. “Then she comes out and she’s like on fire from the first moment. You just thought, Holy shit! What is this? I don’t remember what she sang when. I just remember that our jaws dropped, because she seemed to be singing these songs for the first time, which of course was her gift anyway. We kept clutching each other and gasping and cheering and yelling and carrying on.” “There was a feeling in the hall of electricity, of the walls pumping,” Garland fan Donald Smith recalls. “The audience were like Holy Rollers—it was like a revival meeting. One young man had done an oil painting of her, and as the cheers would break out at the end of a number, he would just hold it up in the air and shake it There was some actress—I cannot think of her name; [maybe] Myrna Loy, maybe Constance Bennett. I was in a box, and I looked down and I saw this woman standing on her seat—I could see these gorgeous evening slippers—yelling, Go, baby, go!’ ” At the same time, Polly Bergen says, whenever Garland sang, “the silences were silences unheard of in a place that size—everybody was rapt.” The cliché has a performer holding an audience in the palm of her hand. This was something different: performer and audience supporting each other, communicating with each other, as intimates, lovers almost, in a hall of 3,000 people. Garland made effortless fun of herself, describing a rococo coif inflicted on her by a Parisian hairdresser which collapsed as soon as she began to perform: “I don’t know why it is I can’t perspire—I just sweat.” She recounted the story of a British journalist who kept telling her how wonderful she looked, and then wrote in a column the next morning, “Judy Garland is fat—but she’s jolly And if you say anything funny to her, she throws her head back and her chins joggle happily.”\n\nThe audience ate it all up. But at the end of the second act, when the band tried to play her off with an instrumental of “Over the Rainbow”—which she hadn’t sung yet—an encore, or encores, was clearly called for. The crowd starting calling out song titles. Garland perked up. “I know!” she crowed. “I’ll sing ’em all, and we’ll stay all night!” It produced the expected reaction. And it was right around then that the dam burst. “All those queens couldn’t control themselves,” Frank Crapanzano says. The gay men in the audience, most sitting in upper levels, went downstairs and ran up the aisles. “Everybody just stood in front of the stage,” Crapanzano recalls. “So Judy realizes that people can’t see—the people who were sitting in the first row, who I guess are the most important people. Anna Maria Alberghetti tapped me on the shoulder, and I said, I’m really sorry.’ So Judy says, Would you mind sitting on the floor?’ Because it was carpeted. So everybody sat down, adoring.” But then, after the final encore (“Do you really want more? Aren’t you tired?” “No!!!”)—the song was “Chicago,” the last number for which the band had sheet music—came a final, roaring charge to the stage: bouquets proffered, programs eagerly raised for autographs, dozens of hands held out just to try to touch hers. Freddie Fields, Polly Bergen claims, had “hired a hundred guys at $50 a pop to storm the stage at the end of the show.” Maybe he did; even if he did, though, it was insurance he scarcely needed. “The one thing I remember,” says Lorna Luft, who was sitting in the front row with her brother, Joey, and their 15-year-old half-sister, Liza, “is that when you’re 8, adults are supposed to act like adults. They are not supposed to jump out of their chairs, screaming, yelling, running towards the stage. They’re supposed to be in control. There they were, all dressed up in the tuxedos, going nuts.” And with that, Rock Hudson lifted Liza and Lorna and Joey up onto the stage, to their mother, and all four took a bow, together.\n\nA thousand fans stood outside the stage entrance, on 56th Street, unwilling to go home. After a while Garland opened her dressing-room window and threw them kisses, but they still wouldn’t leave. An hour and a half later, most of them were still there when she finally emerged. “It was like that famous crowd scene from A Star Is Born,’ ” a columnist wrote, “as she tried to get to her big black limousine, surrounded by police and friends, as her admirers tried to get close enough to touch her.” Like A Star Is Born, yes, except that in this case the star was reborn. “She was queen again,” Polly Bergen says, remembering the star-packed after-party at Luchow’s, where Garland arrived a little while later, beaming, to applause and shouted bravos. Her reign would be brief.\n\nThe album remains, still vivid and astonishing, and listening to it, and imagining the evening (“probably the greatest evening in show business history,” according to the original liner notes: a mild exaggeration, perhaps, but a forgivable one), you hear why people say what they say. The multi-Grammy-winning record—No. 1 on the Billboard charts for 13 weeks in 1961, and never out of print since—is, according to music critic Will Friedwald, “just about the single greatest live album by a singer of popular American standards.” Judy at Carnegie Hall is a talisman for many. Whoopi Goldberg: “When she sings Come Rain or Come Shine’ and she combusts onstage at the end of it, that’s how I always wanted to be as an actor. That has always been one of my bars to reach, that state of grace that she goes into at the end of that song, when she sounds like she’s shaking like a branch that’s being blown, and she’s slightly off-key—just slightly. But it doesn’t matter, because she’s on fire.” Barry Manilow: “Name me one other artist, ever, whose concert is celebrated 50 years after the concert was done When her voice was in tip-top shape, everything she did was filled with the truth. I think that’s the big difference between her and everybody else. Everybody else, oh yeah, they’re great singers—they do vocal acrobatics. But they don’t tell the truth. This woman always told the truth, and especially that night.” And then there’s the singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, who performed and recorded a re-creation of the concert, with the identical song list and orchestrations, at Carnegie Hall in 2006. (He’ll also perform the show for two nights this summer at London’s Royal Opera House.) Some felt this feat was disrespectful, but Wainwright’s motives appear to have been sincere: “Right after the Iraq invasion,” he says, “I was so kind of horrified by what had happened [after] 9/11, where there was this moment of hope where everybody looked as if they wanted to get together and fix the world, and Bush decided to throw a wrench in it completely I was living in America, and I just couldn’t stand it, except when I would put on the Judy Garland record, and it reminded me of this sort of golden era, this hopeful time, this excellence that we once treasured.” It was indeed a hopeful time, Camelot’s brief flicker, and it was a hopeful time for Garland too. Fields and Begelman’s master plan seemed to be on track. In February 1962, Garland was nominated for a best-supporting-actress Oscar for her cameo role in Stanley Kramer’s Judgment at Nuremberg; that same month, a CBS TV special she did with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin was a smash hit, leading the network to sign her to a four-season, $24 million variety series. But she ran afoul of her Sunday-night competition, NBC blockbuster Bonanza, and of CBS president James Aubrey Jr., who turned out to detest her. And we know the rest of the sad saga: she couldn’t stay away from pills, and her health worsened, as did her love life. She met her fifth husband, Mickey Deans, in 1967, when he delivered prescription drugs to her hotel room. When they married, in March 1969, she said, “This is it. For the first time in my life, I am really happy. Finally, finally, I am loved.” Three months later, soon after her 47th birthday, Deans found her dead of a barbiturate overdose in the bathroom of their London apartment. The two-day viewing of her body at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, in Manhattan, became a mass spectacle, drawing thousands of mourners—and preceded by just days the Stonewall riots, a coincidence that has linked the two events in many people’s minds and cemented Garland’s status as a gay icon.

And while Garland was never one to dwell in the past—her signature song is nothing if not a yearning for a splendid future—when I asked Lorna Luft if her mother ever talked about Carnegie Hall, Luft nodded vigorously. “She said, That was something, wasn’t it?’ ” Luft told me. “And it was.”"
