        "text": "For centuries Cyprus was part of the Ottoman Empire and flew Turkish flags. By agreement with the Turkish sovereign, however, the British assumed administrative control of the island in 1878 and subsequently flew the Union Jack there. During World War I the island was annexed by the British, and other colonial flags were then introduced. For example, to the British Red Ensign was added a badge with two lions; this was supposedly the symbol of King Richard I of England, who in 1191 became ruler of Cyprus as part of his involvement in the Crusades. The local peoples of the island, however, had no attachment to British symbols; the Cypriot Greeks and Turks looked respectively to the Greek and Turkish national flags as their own.\n\nOn August 16, 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was proclaimed, with a national flag of neutral design. On a plain white field it bore the island in yellow silhouette with a green olive wreath (symbolizing peace) beneath. This flag was not (and is not) widely used, however, because the Greek and Turkish communities continued to fly the national flags of their original homelands. In 1974 a Turkish invasion of the island, in the face of possible annexation by Greece, led to the establishment of a puppet state on the northern third of the island. Subsequently proclaiming itself independent (but only recognized by Turkey), the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus adopted a flag of its own based on the Turkish model."
