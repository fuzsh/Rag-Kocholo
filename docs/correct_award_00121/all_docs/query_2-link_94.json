        "text": "The creative reception of troubadour lyric in post-medieval poetry constitutes a phenomenon of noteworthy and continuing development throughout the centuries especially in southern France, the very region which well before any other European country produces – from the origins of the early modern to Romanticism – a new Medievalism, characterized by a deeply-rooted rediscovery of its own literary heritage. This literary and cultural trend asserts itself both at an artistic level, with the reinvention of the troubadours’ metrical and thematic devices, and at an ideological level, with a strong sense of linguistic commonality which fosters difficult issues of competition between the literature in the Provençal mother-tongue and the homogenizing power of the French language’s and government’s centralizing influence. Jean de Nostredame (1522-1577) and Frédéric Mistral (1830-1914) represent the two poles of this development, the first being responsible for the first, 16th-century Renaissance provençale and Mistral embodying in the second half of the 19th century the life and soul of the second Renaissance provençale. Nostredame and Mistral are ideally connected by the so-called “Ossian d’Occitanie”, that is Antoine Fabre d’Olivet (1767-1825), a multifaceted figure who draws together Nostredame’s poetic revival and the applications of the then nascent Provençal Philology under the rubric of a neo-troubadourism adapted to the literary taste of his time. Thus, Jean’s Vies de plus célèbres et anciens poètes provençaux (Lyon 1575) is the first anthology containing troubadour vidas (translated into French) and poems (adapted to modern Provençal), intermingled for encomiastic purposes with Nostredame’s own poetical and historical inventions. In the context of the literary heritage of the Troubadours and southern France, Jean’s work is extremely important for the rediscovery and circulation of old Provençal Literature after centuries of oblivion. Fabre d’Olivet, who owned a copy of Nostredame’s Vies, shares with his predecessor the same fascination for the Provençal language, the interest in Middle Ages and a certain reliance upon literary “fakes” to create his own Troubadour. Poésies occitaniques du XIIIe siècle (1803-1804), a collection of supposedly original troubadour songs, which are in fact Fabre’s own imitations of troubadour poems. The fusion of these poetic and political “rediscoveries” finds its most definitive shape in the works of Frédéric Mistral, an advocate of southern French literary heritage and a poet in his own right (Nobel Prize for Literature, 1904). Mistral expands the “mythe” of a Provence in step with the current literary debates and, at the same time, profoundly conscious of its models: the troubadours. Among Mistral’s remarkably vast production I will limit myself to examples from Calendau, in which the biographies of the troubadours are recalled in images reproduced on the “historiated dishes” owned by the hero; from Mireio, in which the Comtessa de Dia plays the role of the president of one of those Cours d’Amour invented by Nostredame and recycled by Fabre; and from Nerto, in which the moral education of the teenaged main character develops through the reading of Matfre Ermengau’s Breviari d’Amor.\n\nThis article explores the poetry of François Jaffrennou, who published under the druidic pseudonym Taldir ab Hernin, as a case study in decolonized multilingualism. Close readings of Taldir’s writing in Breton, Welsh and French reveal the pressures of negotiating a hybrid Celtic-French identity, as he affirms his Celticity while maintaining a careful relationship with France. Taldir criticizes the French state in his Welsh texts, whereas in French and Breton his critique is more guarded, subtly codified. The Celtic space which emerges here is full of tensions, as Taldir works both within and against the impulse to reconcile Celtic and French identities. I argue that being provincially Other in France requires a delicate balancing act, a special way of being French. I also contend that to work on the local is to work on the global, looking beyond regionalist and postcolonial approaches to Breton writing in an effort to dismantle the monolingualizing tendencies of French Studies.\n\nSlovenian and Icelandic literatures – as examples of \"weak\" or \"peripheral\" literary systems – reflect one of the most distinctive cultural phenomena of European romantic nationalism, the \"national poet.\" National poets, such as the Slovene France Prešeren(1800-49) and the Icelander Jonas Hallgrímsson (1807-45), enabled ethno-lingual communities (imagined as \"nations\") to enhance their internal cohesion; on the other hand, national poets were instrumental for facing the anxieties of competing European nationalisms. In the international arena, they proved that a nation – especially one without statehood – resembled other nations and could cope with the canon of world literature. These poets themselves attempted to render topics of presumably national importance in the aesthetic codes that were regarded as \"standards\" of modern artistic developments in core European systems or/and as endemic to the Western tradition. Lives and works of Preseren and Hallgrímsson, as well the processes of their posthumous canonization, show many striking parallels, regardless of differences that can be epitomized by the opposition of de-centered and centered cultural paradigm. Through their apparently surface similarities, the analogies of their structural functions come to the fore. These also shed light on analogous developments of the aesthetic autonomization and nationalization of the two emergent peripheral literatures during romanticism. The paper points out that the notion of the national poet can be subsumed under that of \"cultural saint\" because of pertinent analogies between the Christian tradition of sainthood and national poets, both in their lives (vitae) and practices and symbols of their posthumous elevation, remembrance, and worship (canonisatio, dulia).\n\nJulien Godest (1849–33) was a farmer from Chapelle-Neuve and Callac in the Côtes-d’Armor (north-western Brittany). Unlike most of his fellow agricultural labourers, he was literate and, at some point between 1905–13, he wrote a 300-page autobiography in Breton. He had been solicited to undertake this task by François Jaffrennou (1879–1956), one of the key leaders of the Emsao movement. Godest began this long literary work to testify and to reflect upon his experiences and those of his brother during a crucial period of social, political, geographical, cultural and linguistic change at the end of the 19th century, a period that ushered in what historians define as the “modern age”. Rather than assume the existence of clearly defined cultural entities — for example, Breton or Celtic on the one hand and French on the other — the question of cultural and linguistic contacts raised by the theme of this colloquium induced me to read the text and analyse it in a way that is similar to the ..."
