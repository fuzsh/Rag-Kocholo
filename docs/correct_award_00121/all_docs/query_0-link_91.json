        "text": "(1833-1916), son of a professor of Greek, was born in Madrid. He went to an engineering school, studied economics, and had a distinguished career in the Spanish Government. He was successively Minister of Public Works and Finance Minister. At the height of his career he turned to the stage, a passion that dated back to his youth. A mathematician, engineer, and administrator, he built his plays with the same regard for exactitude and duty that inspired his public life. Conflicts involving duty are at the heart of most of his plays, and he upheld the idea with uncompromising severity. His exalted romanticism appears in his choice of subjects. Like his great predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, Echegaray was a prolific playwright. His most famous plays were: La esposa del vengador (1874) [The Avenger's Wife]; (1875) [The Sword's Handle]; En el pilar y en la cruz (1878) [The Stake and the Cross], a play defending the freedom of thought, which aroused much controversy;zfp=-1 About Homework Help Literature: Classic Search in this topic on About on the Web in Products Web Hosting\n\nLiterature: Classic\n\nwith Esther Lombardi\n\nYour Guide to one of hundreds of sites Home Articles Forums ...

The biographies vary in quality, timeliness, length, and authority. If you don't find a biography here and know of one, please send it along. If there is no biography available, write one and send it along. It will take time for this page to become one of substance. And, in keeping with the beauty of the medium, it will continually grow and change. Credit for this page must go to Dr. Gretchen Whitney at The University of Tennessee where I was a graduate student in the School of Information Science . Dr. Whitney's \"dead German\" assignment gave me inspiration for this page. She also taught me HTML. She may have created a monster. Last revised: August 17, 2002. As a new dimension to this page, I am attempting to locate biographies on Nobel Prize winners in Literature. Those I include will include a notation, (Nobel, year).
