        "text": "(1832–1916). Spanish mathematician, economist, statesman, and playwright José Echegaray was Spain’s most popular dramatist in the latter part of the 19th century. He shared the 1904 Nobel prize for literature with French Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral.\n\nJosé Echegaray was born on April 19, 1832, in Madrid. A professor of mathematics in his early life, he entered government service in 1868, holding various positions. He was named minister of finance in 1874 and played a major role in developing the Banco de España.\n\nHis first play, El libro talonario (The Checkbook), was not produced until 1874, when he was 42; but he had a prolific career, producing an average of two plays a year for the rest of his life. His early work is almost wholly Romantic, but, under the influence of Henrik Ibsen and others, he turned to thesis drama, or drama with a message, in his later work. He often displayed his thesis by use of a satiric reversal; in O locura o santidad (1877; Madman or Saint), he showed that honesty is condemned as madness by society. In all his plays his manner is melodramatic. Although forgotten now, he achieved tremendous popularity in his day because of his fertile imagination, which he almost invariably used to compensate for his lack of dramatic force. His use of skillfully contrived stage effects did much to revolutionize the scope of the Spanish theater. Echegaray died on Sept. 4, 1916, in Madrid."
