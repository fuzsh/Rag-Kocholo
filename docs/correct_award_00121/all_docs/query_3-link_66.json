        "text": "All literature begins with the oral tradition, when stories were told during winter nights after a whole day of hard work.\n\nThe Hispanic oral tradition has a very rich mixed history. The peninsula was invaded first by the Latin—Romans, then by the German visigoths and later by the Muslims who remained for more than eight hundred years, developing their culture, and given a strong influence to the rich oral tradition. Also the tribal cultures were incorporated when the Spaniards invaded and attacked them. As a result of all these invasions, including Africa, new stories were created in response to new realities. But the written literature had a different development. Those who knew how to read and had access to books, initiated a written literature, based on the popular tradition. Since then the scenario were filled with exceptional writers like: Miguel De Cervantes y Saavedra who published the first part of his famous “ El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote De La Mancha ”—(Don Quijote) in 1605.\n\nSeveral Nobel prizes have given prestige to the Spanish writers at the end of the nineteenth century: Jose Echegaray (1832-1916, Nobel Prize 1904), Jacinto Benavente (1866-1916, Nobel Prize 1922), Juan Ramón Jiménez (1881-1958, Nobel Prize 1956. Vicente Aleixandre (1900-1984). Camilo José Cela (1916, Nobel Prize 1989. All these writers obtained worldwide recognition, but Latin American writers practically were known first in Europe, when numerous publishing houses appeared, some of them devoted exclusively to children’s publications. Various awards were established, contributing to the legitimization of a gendre throughout the Spanish speaking world.\n\nThe Latin American literature developed differently but consistently in the various countries, describing the need of Latin American reality. Private publishing houses also began to recognize the rich Latin heritage and to publish beautifully illustrated versions of traditional legends and poetry.\n\nThe theme of multiple heritage is a historical reality for Hispanics. The novelist José Mar’a Merino, surprised that the historically significant experiences of the invasion and colonization of Latin America were not represented in the literature for young readers, attempted to respond to the challenge. His trilogy of novels has as a protagonist, a young boy who is the son of a Spanish “conquistador” and an Indian mother. Unfortunately there remains a lack of other books that attempt to address this subject matter. (2)\n\nThe history of Spain and Latin America has begun to be a literacy subject for young readers. Many of our classrooms have students who are newcomers to this country, and the necessity to understand their needs is strong. Teachers must have information to foster mutual understandings.\n\nThis Unit has been written with these needs in mind but optimum learning, however does not take place without a supportive environment that includes social acceptance. It is difficult to provide that environment if we do not fully explore, acknowledge, and respect the diverse cultures present, whether for newcomers or of longtime citizens who retain ethnic attributes."
