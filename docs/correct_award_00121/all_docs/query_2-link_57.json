        "text": "It is the ultimate goal of all armed U.S. militia members to die in a blaze of glory. Or, anyway, to die. They know they can’t win, that most Americans regard them as dildos. Now that Robert Finicum was shot while grabbing for his loaded pistol, he is being touted as a patriot, hero, and—dare I say it?—martyr. He is forever frozen in time now that he has had his moment.\n\nHe can never go back to his eleven children in Colorado City, Arizona.\n\nWait a minute! Colorado City, Arizona. Isn’t that the isolated town in Northwestern Arizona that is run by the FLDS, the Fundamentalist Church of Latter Day Saints? Isn’t that the town ruled by Warren Jeffs, its patriarch, now serving time in prison for child sexual assault?\n\nIs the late LaVoy a polygamist? Eleven children, but how many wives? How was that association missed by the national press?\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nIn yesterday’s blog post, “[Not] The Nobel Prize for Literature,” I blasted the Swedish Academy for awarding prizes to a lot of mediocre writers who have not stood the test of time. As with all annual awards in the arts—and I include the Oscars and the Pulitzer Prizes in this as well—there are a goodly number of clinkers, but there are also some real finds.\n\nProbably the one Nobelist whose work I have discovered and grew to love, perhaps the greatest is Halldór Laxness, Iceland’s sole laureate in literature. In the last few years, I’ve read mot of his work that is available in English translation, including such masterworks as Independent People, Iceland’s Bell, The Atom Station, and World Light.\n\nAlthough no one I know has ever read any Laxness, I regard him as a giant of world literature. In 2013, I even visited his house in Mosfellsbaer (see below).\n\nOther Nobelist authors whose work is little known today, but whose work I love,are Knut Hamsun of Norway, Ivan Bunin of Russia, François Mauriac of France, Ivo Andrić of Yugoslavia, and Miguel Ángel Asturias of Guatemala.\n\nSometimes, the awards like the Nobels are useful, when they are not tainted by politics. It is said that Jorge Luis Borges of Argentina lost his chance at the prize when he accepted an honor from Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. At that point, one leftist member of the Swedish Academy essentially said, “Over my dead body!”\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nI don’t have too much good to say about the Swedish Academy, which decides who will receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. If you look at the list of its recipients, it would not take too much effort to produce a list of as great as or even greater literary figures who have not received the laureate. Let me take a stab at it:\n\nKobo Abe (Japan), Woman in the Dunes\n\nChinua Achebe (Nigeria), Things Fall Apart\n\nRyunosuke Akutagawa (Japan), Rashomon\n\nJorge Amado (Brazil), Gabriela: Clove and Cinnamon\n\nW. H. Auden (UK), Poetry\n\nGeorges Bernanos (France), Mouchette\n\nJorge Luis Borges (Argentina), Ficciones\n\nJoseph Conrad (UK/Poland), Nostromo\n\nRichard Flanagan (Australia), The Narrow Road to the Deep North\n\nGraham Greene (UK), The Heart of the Matter\n\nVassili Grossman (Russia), Life and Fate\n\nHenry James (US/UK), The Ambassadors\n\nJames Joyce (Ireland), Ulysses\n\nYashar Kemal (Turkey), Memed, My Hawk\n\nGyula Krúdy (Hungary), The Red Post Coach\n\nStanislaw Lem (Poland), Solaris\n\nOsip Mandelstam (Russia), Poetry\n\nVladimir Nabokov (US/Russia), Lolita\n\nFernando Pessoa (Portugal), The Book of Disquiet\n\nMarcel Proust (France), In Search of Lost Time\n\nArkady and Boris Strugatsky (Russia), Roadside Picnic\n\nItalo Svevo (Slovenia), Confessions of Zeno\n\nLeo Tolstoy (Russia), Novels and Stories\n\nMark Twain (US), Novels and Stories\n\nEvelyn Waugh (UK), Brideshead Revisited\n\nVirginia Woolf (UK), Mrs Dalloway\n\nAs you can see, I have not overloaded the list with the names of American authors, in the interests of being fair. If I wanted to, I can add names like Philip Roth, Ursula K. Le Guin, Joyce Carol Oates, Philip K. Dick, Cormac McCarthy, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, and a few others.\n\nThese can replace such figures as the following, whose reputations have not kept up with the times: Bjornsterne Bjornson, José Echegaray, Giosue Carducci, Rudolf Christoph Eucken, Paul von Heyse, Verner von Heidenstam, Karl Adolph Gjellerup, Henrik Pontopiddan, Carl Spitteler, Jacinto Benavente, Grazia Deledda, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, Pearl S. Buck, Frans Eemil Sillanpaa [SIC], Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, Earl Russell, and a few dozen others—mostly Scandinavian nonentities which at one time were highly thought of by a couple dozen mouldy Swedish academics. (Please forgive me for being lax about the diacritical marks in the above names.)\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nI haven’t written about South America lately, so I decided to return to it. If my visit to Chile seems haphazard and unplanned (Puerto Varas to Valparaíso to Santiago), it is because my sightseeing goals were, to say the least, abstruse. Remember, I probably wouldn’t have gone to Argentina if it weren’t for my readings of such writers as Jorge Luis Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Juan José Saer, and César Aira. My favorite Chilean writer is the poet Pablo Neruda. So I went to Chile to visit his three houses.\n\nIt’s not really abstruse, I guess, because Neruda was not only a great poet; he was also a great domestic architect and designer. He had some money to work with because he was not only a poet, but served various diplomatic posts, particularly in Mexico.\n\nThe first house I visited was at Isla Negra, about an hour south of Valparaíso. It was my favorite of the three, located as it is on a nice stretch of beach. Also it was not trashed by Pinochet’s fascist supporters after Salvador Allende fell, like La Chascona in Santiago was. Isla Negra seems to go on forever, with quirky bars, dining rooms, nautical and railroad themes, and fascinating collectibles.\n\nHigh on a hill, on Avenida Alemania, with a sweeping view of Valparaíso’s bay, is the towering La Sebastiana. Like Isla Negra, it still has all the original furnishings, with the poet’s quirky love of nautical themes. On the day I went, the house was full of French tourists.\n\nFinally, in the city’s ritzy Bellavista area is La Chascona, which means “messy hair.” The reference is to wife Matilde Urrutia’s hair. This house is tucked against a hill and does not have any sweeping views the way the other two houses do. Although the original furnishings were trashed in 1973 by fascisti supporting dictator General Augusto Pinochet, Matilde managed to salvage many of her late husband’s original decorations, such that one scarcely notices the damage that had been done.\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nYou would think after ten years circumnavigating the Mediterranean, losing all of his crew to various disasters, being imprisoned by the witch Circe, and massacring the many suitors of his wife Penelope, that Odysseus would take a rest. According to Alfred Lord Tennyson, he does—for all of three years. In his poem “Ulysses,” Odysseus is eager once again to hit the road:\n\nIt little profits that an idle king,\n\nBy this still hearth, among these barren crags,\n\nMatch’d with an aged wife, I mete and dole\n\nUnequal laws unto a savage race,\n\nThat hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.\n\nI cannot rest from travel: I will drink\n\nLife to the lees: All times I have enjoy’d\n\nGreatly, have suffer’d greatly, both with those\n\nThat loved me, and alone, on shore, and when\n\nThro’ scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\n\nVext the dim sea: I am become a name;\n\nFor always roaming with a hungry heart\n\nMuch have I seen and known; cities of men\n\nAnd manners, climates, councils, governments,\n\nMyself not least, but honour’d of them all;\n\nAnd drunk delight of battle with my peers,\n\nFar on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\n\nI am a part of all that I have met;\n\nYet all experience is an arch wherethro’\n\nGleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades\n\nFor ever and forever when I move.\n\nHow dull it is to pause, to make an end,\n\nTo rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use!\n\nAs tho’ to breathe were life! Life piled on life\n\nWere all too little, and of one to me\n\nLittle remains: but every hour is saved\n\nFrom that eternal silence, something more,\n\nA bringer of new things; and vile it were\n\nFor some three suns to store and hoard myself,\n\nAnd this gray spirit yearning in desire\n\nTo follow knowledge like a sinking star,\n\nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.\n\nThis is my son, mine own Telemachus,\n\nTo whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,—\n\nWell-loved of me, discerning to fulfil\n\nThis labour, by slow prudence to make mild\n\nA rugged people, and thro’ soft degrees\n\nSubdue them to the useful and the good.\n\nMost blameless is he, centred in the sphere\n\nOf common duties, decent not to fail\n\nIn offices of tenderness, and pay\n\nMeet adoration to my household gods,\n\nWhen I am gone. He works his work, I mine.\n\nThere lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:\n\nThere gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\n\nSouls that have toil’d, and wrought, and thought with me—\n\nThat ever with a frolic welcome took\n\nThe thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\n\nFree hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;\n\nOld age hath yet his honour and his toil;\n\nDeath closes all: but something ere the end,\n\nSome work of noble note, may yet be done,\n\nNot unbecoming men that strove with Gods.\n\nThe lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:\n\nThe long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep\n\nMoans round with many voices. Come, my friends,\n\n’T is not too late to seek a newer world.\n\nPush off, and sitting well in order smite\n\nThe sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\n\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n\nOf all the western stars, until I die.\n\nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down:\n\nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\n\nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\n\nTho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’\n\nWe are not now that strength which in old days\n\nMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;\n\nOne equal temper of heroic hearts,\n\nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will\n\nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\n\nI don’t know about the mariners he addresses in the last stanza, considering that all his original crew is no more. Perhaps these are new ones, eager to embark on ticking off their own bucket lists.\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nFor several weeks now, we have been regaled with stories about the Men of Malheur (French for “unhappiness”) holed up with their leader, Ammon Bundy at an Oregon federal wildlife refuge. They are dressed in camouflage, armed to the teeth, and muy macho. The fact that cynical Americans have been mailing them dildos and sexual lubricants suggests another view of these wackadoodle warriors.\n\nAll of them are equipped with copies of the U.S. Constitution. Considering their educational level, however, it might as well be Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. I rather suspect that most are hoping to fall in a hail of bullets defending their beliefs, whatever they may be. Fortunately, the Feds are willing to pick them off one by one as the protest decays, which it gives every sign of doing. Eventually, it will all end up in court, with the defendants angry and confused as to why they are being picked on.\n\nThe Second Amendment of the Constitution states: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The resemblance of these bozos to a “well regulated militia” is at best highly speculative.\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nThere is one class of people who are almost untouchable when they commit economic crimes while at the helm of their companies: I am referring to Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), to which I might also add Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and Chief Operating Officers (COOs). To date, there has been no major prosecutions of the bank and securities firms CEOs who were responsible for the Great Recession of 2008—despite the fact that they, in many cases, knowingly put together subprime mortgage securities backed (essentially) by hope and pixie dust.\n\nThere have been cases of CEOs who have served time (or are serving time). These include:\n\nJeff Skilling, Enron\n\nMartha Stewart, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia\n\nSanjay Kumar, Computer Associates\n\nDennis Kozlowski, Tyco\n\nJohn Rigas, Adelphia\n\nMartin L. Grass, Rite-Aid\n\nJoseph Nacchio, Qwest\n\nWalter Forbes, Cendant\n\nRichard Scrushy, HealthSouth\n\nBernie Ebbers, WorldCom\n\nKen Lay of Enron would have joined that list, but he died of a heart attack before sentencing. For more information about the above, click here.\n\nThere are class action suits, but these have a way of punishing the innocent and leaving the guilty scot-free. For one thing, it is the shareholders who suffer, not the executives. In many cases, it is the shareholders who have initiated the cases and suffer from the resulting devaluation of their securities. And probably the biggest beneficiaries are law firms specializing in class action cases. These boys make out like bandits.\n\nWhether CEOs wind up doing the perp walk is not the main point. I would be happy to see blame ascribed and large fines levied.\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nThomas Bewick (1753-1828) was one of Britain’s great unsung artists. Known as an engraver and a naturalist (he authored A History of British Birds), he won the admiration of no less than John James Audubon, who visited him in 1827:\n\nAs length we reached the dwelling of the Engraver, and I was at once shewn his workshop. There I met the old man, who, coming towards me, welcomed me with a hearty shake of the hand, and for a moment took off a cotton night-cap, somewhat soiled by the smoke of the place. He was a tall stout man, with a large head, and with eyes placed farther apart than those of any man I have evr seen: a perfect old Englishman, full of life, although seventy-four years of age, active and prompt in his labors. Presently, he proposed shewing me the work he was at, and went on with his tools. It was a small vignette, cut on a block of boxwood not more than than three by two inches in surface, and represented a dog frightened at night by what he fancied to be living objects, but were actually roots and branches of trees, rocks, and other objects bearing the semblance of men. This curious piece of art, like all his works, was exquisite.\n\nThe illustration described by Audubon is shown below and constitutes one of the artist’s famous tail-pieces, which were dashed off to fill blank space at the end of a chapter.\n\nThis is not to detract from Bewick’s carefully observed engravings of birds and mammals of his native Northumberland. It’s merely to admit that I am not as acute an observer of nature as Bewick was and could not appreciate them as much as other naturalists such as Audubon and Sir Joseph Banks.\n\nOne image that afforded me some amusement was of a traveler urinating on the wall of a Roman ruin:\n\nNote the shadow of the traveler cast on the wall, something one doesn’t usually see on a casual illustration of this sort. But Bewick was always meticulous in his observations.\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nThose of you who are vegetarians can stop reading now. Following is a piece from today’s Iceland Review about how Icelanders celebrate the start of Þorri.\n\nTomorrow marks the beginning of the old month þorri, which generally is celebrated with traditional Icelandic food, enjoyed at large gatherings called þorrablót, held in various places throughout the month.\n\nThe food, typically served as buffet, includes the items listed below:\n\nDark rye bread, slightly sweet and slowly baked, commonly called þrumari or thunderer, because of the thundering it frequently produces at the rear end of those who enjoy it.\n\nDried fish, or harðfiskur: extremely addictive, despite its distinguished, strong smell. It’s most frequently enjoyed with a bit of butter.\n\nPutrefied shark, served in tiny cubes the size of sugar cubes, but quite different in taste. These cubes are not for the delicate, but a delicacy to others.\n\nBrennivín, also known as Black Death or aquavit, brewed from potatoes. This beverage is ideal for getting the shark down your throat.\n\nRotten eggs. The best ones are said to come from the West Fjords. They are indeed rotten and smell rotten.\n\nRams’ testicles which have been boiled and then cured in whey. You will be spared any further description.\n\nPressed meat from the heads of lambs, or head cheese, often cured in whey. Don’t let the description scare you away. This is considered delicious.\n\nLiver sausage, made from the liver of sheep, is every child’s favorite. Its cousin, the blood sausage, is also popular, but together we call them slátur, meaning slaughter.\n\nIf none of the above is to your liking, rest assured you will like the hangikjöt or smoked lamb, which cannot be missed.\n\nNote that the food above is proof how well our forefathers made use of their resources and let nothing go to waste. For preservation, meat was either smoked or stored in whey, and fish was dried.\n\nSo, if you’re invited to a þorrablót, don’t let the chance go by to experience it. Dress up and be ready to dance after dinner. [Or something.]\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:"
