The Nobel Prize in Literature (often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Literature) is a prestigious international prize awarded annually to authors in recognition of their outstanding bodies of literary work. It is one of the five prizes established by the Swedish chemist and inventor Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) in his will.

Each year, the laureate is selected in October by the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy from a long list of candidates - usually about 200 nominations - received by the February 1 deadline. The laureate receives a gold medal and a diploma in addition to a large sum of money for the prize at a ceremony held in Stockholm.

With the exception of eight years (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940–1943 and 2018), the prize has been awarded continuously since 1901. In 1904, the prize was jointly awarded to the Spanish author José Echegaray and the French author Frédéric Mistral. In 1917, it was jointly awarded to the Danish authots Karl Adolph Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidian. In 1966, it was jointly awarded to the Israeli author Shmuel Yosef Agnon and the German-born Swedish author Nelly Sachs. In 1974, it was jointly awarded to the Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson. Although no prize was awarded in the year 2018, a winner for 2018 was officially named on October 10, 2019, at the same time that the 2019 winner was announced.

The Nobel Prize in Literature was declined by the Soviet writer Boris Pasternak in 1958 and by the French author Jean-Paul Sartre in 1966.
