Lewis, 1822-1862, married Evalin Allen, their children were: A. Juliet, 1842. B. Martha J., 1845. C. Susanah, 1845. D. John ?, 1848. E. Daniel James, 1850. F. Virginia, 1852. G. Jonathan Wiseman, 1856. H. William A., 1858. I. Atlanta, 1862.\n\n- Lewis Wilford was the one killed by friendly fire, not too far north of Round Grove, during the Civil War. The family story is that his horse returned to his unit in Mt. Vernon, Lawrence Co. seat, and then the Hunts were notified and Daniel and Jonathan went north to Dade Co. to retrieve his body from a cornfield and he was reburied in what became the Round Grove Cem. Obviously someone found out the details of his shooting and where.\n\n- Lewis W. Hunt, the Civil War casualty, and family attended Mt. Pisgah, I understand. Lewis was killed by \"friendly fire\" by the 6th Mo. Cav. near Greenfield on Sept. 6, 1862. His body was retrieved by brothers Jonathan and Daniel and buried on their father's property. His mother was buried next to him when she died in August 1865. I have always understood that Lewis's grave was the first burial in what is now Round Grove Cemetery, but there has been some mention of an earlier grave. However, I have not seen any definitive proof of an earlier grave. Records research by Willie Washam revealed that the first Round Grove Church building was just west of these graves on the then road whiich angled from the SE to the NW at that time across the John Hunt, Sr. property. The road was straightened and relocated to its present route sometime after 1879 and before 1900. The church building constructed by our Grandad Marion Dee Hunt was located to the east of the cemetery next to the new road location.\n\nFrom the Lawrence County Missouri History, pub. by Lawrence County Historical Society (no date), pp 480-481.\n\n- \"Lewis Hunt\"\n\n\"by Reva (Hunt) West\"\n\n\"Private Lewis Hunt, was born in Tennessee March 30, 1822. During the Civil War, he served in Company C., 76 Regiment. He enrolled in the MIssouri Militia, commanded by Samuel E. Roberts and was ordered into active service August 15, 1862. Private Hunt was killed September 6, 1862, near Greenfield, Mo., from pistol or gun shot, by Captain Montgomery's men of the 6th Regiment M. S. Private Lewis Hunt, of the Union Army, was carrying dispatches to Greenfield (Dade County), from Mt. Vernon (Lawrence County), by horse back. While being overtaken by Captain Montgomery's men, Hunt sought refuge in a corn shock. He was buried in a shallow grave, covered with brush and poles, in Dade County. Private Hunt's horse was led into Mt. Vernon; it was there the horse and saddle were recognized as belonging to him. Word was then received by his two brothers, Daniel and Jonathan Hunt, who went to the cornfiield where he was buried, dug up their brother from his shallow grave, and buried him west of Round Grove Baptist Church in Lawrence County. He was the first person buried in the Round Grove Cemetery. John Hunt, father of Lewis, Jonathan, and Daniel, donated the land for Round Grove Church and Cemetery. The amount of pay due Private Lewis Hunt was paid to his widow, Evaline (Allen) Hunt, who was married to him May 22, 1841, in Smith County Tenn. This information was supplied by William Cullens, Jr., ??rayton Plains, Michigan, and by Marion Dee Hunt (Nephew of Lewis Hunt and father of Reva (Hunt) West, Miller, Missouri.)\"\n\n21.

The village site contained 52 lots.”\n\n“Those who first settled at the Round Grove area were J. Hunt from Smith County Kentucky, [should say Tennessee] coming here in 1841, F.J. Shaffer from Washington County Virginia in 1868, and in 1867 W.P. Robinson from Liberson County, New York.”\n\n“The Baptist Church which was organized in September, 1865, held their first meetings in the Ozark school house which was a log building and on the farm of Jonathan Hunt near North Whiteoak.” etc.\n\nA correction from another resercher:\n\n“That should be Smith Co., Tennessee as to where our Hunt ancestors were before migrating to southwest Missouri. From what I have seen Jonathan Hunt did some preaching and in looking at the marriage records from Lawrence Co., MO in the second half of the 1800s, Jonathan married several couples in the Round Grove area. Round Grove originally was known as Huntsville.”\n\n“The Hunts moved into southwest Missouri in the 1840's. At first their area was a part of Dade Co., MO before the formation of Lawrence Co. New info that I heard recently from Willie Washam who has put together two publications on the history of northern Lawrence Co. including the schools, is that originally 17 year old Jonathan Hunt, your ancestor, was the one who first went to southwest MO to claim some land. Evidently he returned to Smith Co., TN as he married there Elizabeth Woodson, daughter of Tucker and Mary Weeks Woodson, and sister of my g-grandmother, Mary Woodson Hunt. After Elizabeth died Jonathan married Malinda Poland. The entire family of our common ancestors, John and Elizabeth Allen Hunt, migrated to Missouri. After Elizabeth died in 1865 John went to Crittenden Co., KY to visit relatives and ended up marrying a Civil War widow, Sarah Paris Swansey/Swancey, stayed there and had 4 more children. An interesting note is what a descendant of John's nephew who still lives in Crittenden Co. says and that is that the local story was that John and Sarah's neighbor was probably the actual father of the last child who was named for the neighbor.”\n\nRESEARCH NOTES\n\n- Another tree on ancestry lists him as Jonathan W Hunt born 14 Mar 1823 Smith or Sumner Co, Tennessee, died 14 Mar 1905 Lawrence Co Missouri - sourced from the Harris Family Tree which adds that he was the son of John Thomas Hunt (1798-1884) and Elizabeth Jane Moore (1797-1865)\n\n- Jonathan was either married before (yes), or was looking after brothers/sisters/cousins - there were many other children in his household in the 1860 census, and perhaps Nancy in the 1870 census that were too old to be the children of Melinday, who was much younger than Jonathan. No relationships were listed in these census’. I have tentatively entered all but the youngest child from 1860 census as children of a first marriage (as are the older children in 1870).\n\n- appears to be married twice - 1850 census. Can’t find marriage between Jonathan and Elzabeth in MO marriage index. Perhaps in Tennessee?

I think the confusion was in sisters being involved but the sisters actually involved here were Elizabeth WOODSON who was married to Jonathan and that came from the will of Tucker Woodson, father, and Mary Woodson who was the wife of Daniel. I finally got the Lawrence Co. Historical Society to correct the Elizabeth Poland thing when I sent them a copy of the death certificate of Martha Hunt Crouch, wife of William Crouch, son of Allen. That dc lists Elizabeth Woodson as Martha's mother and Martha's father as Jonathan Hunt.\n\nNOTE: But Jonathan Hunt’s second wife was Malinda Sarah Poland, daughter of Joseph and America (Calendar) Poland, so no wonder it’s extra confusing!\n\n24.

Atlanta, 1827-1892. 1st married Allen Crouch; 2nd married Thomas Patterson.\n\n- In thinking of the 1845 marriage of Atlanta 'Attie' Hunt to Wilson Henson, I'm wondering if they might have met in the old Mt. Pisgah Church which was 3 miles northwest of Mt. Vernon according to the history of churches book published by the Lawrence Co. Historical Society, which was probably close to where the Hensons lived several miles SSE of Round Grove. I've seen this church mentioned in some of the Hunt information I've collected from old newspapers, etc. and assume from this that it must have been where at least some of the Round Grove Hunts attended. 1845 was in the time frame that they migrated from Smith Co., TN.\n\n- Based on a recent comment in the LCHS BULLETIN, or another source, Mt. Pisgah Church was in or very near Truitt Creek just east of the Mt. Vernon / Greenfield Road (present day Mo. Hwy. 39). Truitt Creek was for some time referred to as \"Henson Creek\" in the mid-20th Century. The Henson Cemetery is just north of Truitt Creek by the old MV / Greenfield Road to the east of Hwy. 39. (Mo. Hwy 39 diverges west from the old MV / Greenfield Road at the Truitt Creek crossing.\n\n[From Google Maps: Truitt Creek is less than 10km NE of Mt Vernon and roughly E of Carthage, W of Springfield and S of Greenfield Dade Co. Truitt Creek (community) is said to be located on the N/S road “M” (an extension of “Lawrence 1163”) and just north of the Summit Baptist Church and Summit Cemetery located on the E/W ross road “Lawrence 2100”. The actual Truitt Creek flows under “M” its journey NW. The creek follows a long “upside down U” route, eventually crossing Hwy 39 before it merges with Williams Creek just west of Mt Vernon between roads “Lawrence 1117 and 1105” .]\n\nRESEARCH NOTES\n\nWhose children were whose? Attie married 3 times (reportedly), and her husband may have married more than once. Did step-children go by step-surnames at times?"
