(AP) -- William S. Burroughs, the stone-faced godfather of the 'Beat generation' whose experimental novel Naked Lunch unleashed an underground world that defied narration, died yesterday. He was 83.\"\n\n-Providence Sunday Journal\n\nThis morning, I was devestated by an article in the paper announcing that my favorite writer, William S. Burroughs, died yesterday. At 6:50 p.m. in Lawrence Kansas, at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, about 24 hours after suffering a heart attack, Uncle Bill departed from our world.\n\nBurroughs was a huge artistic inspiration to me, so I've decided to construct a tribute to him, in honor of his life, his art, his being, and his death which has brought me extreme pain. I don't mean \"tribute\" in the sense that I want to put together some lame Burroughs web page, I want to get people to send me artwork, photography, writings, gather some of his best works, important sound bytes, photos of him, and whatever else I can get together to honor him which I will eventually be turning into a B&W pamphlet/zine featuring everything I am sent and a lot of my own work as well.\n\nI'm looking for original art (especially 3 or 4 good portraits of him), photography (of and pertaining to him), writings relating to him, personal correspondences with him, stories of personal experiences with him, original films pertaining to him, or anything else that you think may fit.\n\nI am also looking for copies of films relating to him (any films he was in, films he made, films he contributed to, films based on him or his works, documentaries about him, interviews with him, public appearances by him, etc.), prints or copies of his artwork, or anything else that would otherwise be hard to come by.\n\nIf you're into it, please get back to me as soon as possible. It's no particular rush, but I just want to get things in order as to who's going to be helping out.\n\nThe beginnings of the web page can be found at--\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/SoHo/3586/wsb.html\n\nAnyways, thanks for your time and please get back to me whenever you have a chance...\n\n//nEo-mEssiah\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/SoHo/3586/\n\nthe neo-messiah <neo_messiah@hotmail.com>\n\nxxx, xx xxxxx - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 16:29:24 (EDT)\n\nDid I ever tell you about the man who taught this asshole to think?

An\n\nex-girlfriends voice on the other end that smelled gutted,\n\ndeboned, bloodless, the callous on a heel. Had the world got\n\nto her so soon? I know there are nails on board the getting\n\n-around, been-there and got-to-see-this-too. They hit hard\n\nand poke from the opportunities that draw one to corners and\n\nnew floors, the Learn vs. Teach curve; heres a word of\n\ncaution and heres an idea and now dont forget to use them\n\nboth sparingly...When I knew her last, she was fast, a\n\nmaster of American tongue, polished at the refinery, built\n\nfor velocity and speed and precision. She said, How are\n\nyou taking it, first. That was the first thing she said. It\n\ntook a while for her to get to this thing I should already\n\nhave known about, should already have held close and sweated\n\non. They got this little tribute at the book store up in\n\nNorth Beach, something, you can see it from out in the\n\nstreet. There was only the voice and it lulled under a\n\nmuffled strain, like the speaker wires in her receiver had\n\ngot tangled and confused, bypassing the phone lines hanging\n\nout her window, pouring haplessly into a stew of\n\nmercurochrome and stone, touching down like cigar ash.\n\nYeah, she said. A little thing, you know. Empty shells\n\nfrom a six-shooter, couple a dead roses, a black and white\n\nof him sitting in this, what are those with and on the\n\nwater, yeah, this rowboat, with a hand on each ore. An\n\nonly he can pull off dignity in a silly place like that you\n\nknow it sucks an its all resting there on this silver\n\nplatter probably from some junk shop or some cocktail party\n\nthey had last month or other...' She clucked her tongue or\n\nmaybe had to walk away someplace for a while, got up to\n\ngrab a smoke or a glass of ice tea and Im knowing the voice\n\nis just wrong, missing elements, radial dispondance that\n\nthrows a flask of Blue Nun over everything, skipping the\n\nhinge that turns sound to word to image. Just these\n\nbronchial fists of circumlocution tumbling out her mouth,\n\nlanding flat, loose, dull, like grey streaks, ghosts for\n\ndustpans and disposal units. They also got a cane leaning\n\nupside and against the window tho I suspect its all bought\n\non the ritual dime and the old man layed a hand on it never\n\nmost like. But thats you know, the word, and in the\n\nbeginning there was and he aint no more and maybe they fly\n\nthe flag at half-mast this week in Tangiers you know. Oh and\n\nI hope you are well. I listened once more and erased the\n\nwhole thing. Before I went to sleep I heard a garage door\n\nhit the ground. And the walls looked ordinary till I turned\n\noff the light.\n\ntodd s. glider <tsglider@earthlink.net>\n\nSan Francisco, CA 94110 - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 14:30:33 (EDT)\n\nWell, my favorite is \"The Yage Letters\", among other things Burroughs was a good reporter and a very funny one too.

Tanasescu\n\nSand Yiego, Ca USA - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 12:40:51 (EDT)\n\nBurroughs was one of the best writers in American history. He was able to say FUCK YOU!!, in the face of any one who said no to him. The fact that he lived to be 83 was to me his own choice and since the death of Allen, he realized it was time to go now since he had now out lived nearly every one he was every associated with from Jack Kerouac to Kurt Kobain.

Revolution was in\n\nthe air and I managed to aquire a small tape recorder\n\nwhile reading the book.\n\nIt seemed to me that Burroughs was somehow linked\n\nto another dimension from whence flowed is words --\n\nalmost like automatic-writing from a spiritual\n\nworld slightly higher than normal consciousness.\n\nI saw the movie Burroughs and learned about his\n\naccidental shooting of his wife while trying to shoot\n\nan apple off her head. What a horrible thing to do!\n\nSheila, my love partner's, son oddly enough became\n\nfascinated with Burroughs in his freshman year at\n\ncollege. He turned me onto a Jazz recording\n\nBurroughs did -- I loved it! Theres no doubt about\n\nhis artistic genius -- but I'm just not sure about\n\nthe seamier side of his life. Was it all worth it?\n\nWould he have lived differently if he had to do it\n\nover -- and if so would his artistic genius have been\n\nsacrificed or could he have even produced greater\n\nworks? Nevertheless, he lives on thru his works.\n\nTom Derry <tzon@bellsouth.net>\n\nWhites Creek, TN USA - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 12:12:46 (EDT)\n\nA gaunt, skeletal-like spectre transfixes us \"college\n\nkids\" with his gravel-edged voice and visceral imagery.\n\nAfter the reading we're invited to a signing. Forgetting to\n\nbring a book, I ask him to autograph my trench coat.\n\n20 years later that coat hangs in my closet like a piece of\n\nthe Cross, an object sanctified by a peculiarly American\n\nanti-Pope. I also have a letter he wrote me in response to a\n\nscreenplay I'm sure I desperately wanted him to bless.\n\n\"Portentous\" was the word he used to describe the work and\n\nthe upcoming year.\n\nFor me, Burroughs was kind of like a long lost Grandfather.\n\nSurly, knowledgeable, artistic, passionate, mentor-like in\n\nhis dogged infusion with whatever the Now radiated. Like\n\nWarhol, he redefined what art could be. His outlaw vision\n\nhelped release the noose of 50's white bread Americana\n\n(after we'd ejaculated, of course.) His experiments with the\n\nlanguage were about changing consciousness, about re-\n\nsexualizing the body, about creating play in a post-atomic\n\ncorporatization of everything Age.\n\nReading these memorials makes me think that maybe William\n\nachieved his mission. He obviously helped catalyze several\n\ngeneration's wilder ideas about the nature of communication,\n\nand the diversity of our and other world's sexual/psychic/\n\norganic politics. He certainly expanded the cultural\n\npossibilities open to an irascible old homo coot.\n\nA friend told me yesterday he felt Burroughs was like a force\n\nof nature, something you expected to always be around. Like\n\na junk habit, maybe? Like everything we mortals \"need\" to be\n\nbigger than life, Burroughs death has reinforced the notion\n\nthat we are all here to go...to roam the Western Lands...to\n\nbe the guardians of the future.\n\nTo simply say I will miss Burroughs discounts the profound\n\neffect he had on my personal & artistic development. I have\n\nonly gratitude and a sense of awe for this, in the end,\n\nall too human trailblazer. Thank You!

My brother directed \"BURROUGHS, The Movie\" as his thesis film, while attending New York University Film School. After my commenting on the state of the food in his refrigerator, William simply said to me \"cheese doesn't go bad, it just gets cheesier.\" I have used this line many times since then. Once, when we were eating lunch at some dump, perhaps the Great Jones Cafe, he was approached my many adoring fans (mostly women), and with a slight smirk, he looked at me and said \"not bad for an old faggot, huh?\" I have not yet found an opportunity to use this line, but I am still working on it. Goodbye Bill. Thanks for the use of the Orgone Box. Oh, yeah, by the way, don't ever let William Burroughs try to shoot an apple off of your head.\n\nSteve Brookner <Moriarty19@aol.com>\n\nMiami, FL USA - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 10:34:15 (EDT)\n\nthe queer, junkie priest has left the building\n\nW.Dan\n\nSeattle, Wa USA - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 10:18:24 (EDT)\n\nBiII didnt just beat the 0dds, he Iaughed in their face and ridicuIed them\n\nwhat a Iife\n\nAIIways an inspirati0n\n\nAIan Bamf0rd <alanb@netlink.net.au>\n\nMeIb0urne, AustraIia - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 10:14:07 (EDT)\n\nyou can't beat the mark inside.......\n\ngoodbye to you bill you hold a dear place in my life and i'm still trying to use all i've learned from you .\n\nwe have lost a great man ..............\n\nbob\n\nrobert clements <uberfrau@msn.com>\n\nmiami, fl usa - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 10:02:05 (EDT)\n\ni have been reading the obits on Burroughs for the last few days, and i see the staff writers are doing the same thing to Burroughs that they did to Ginsberg (and all nonconformists). The obituaries contain numerous subtle and not-so-subtle denunciations. Of course people like Burroughs and Ginsberg are \"softly\" dismissed for drug use, as everyone seems to be afraid of that boogeyman these days...yawn. I have been spurred to write this because of one obit in particular, penned by Tony Perry of the LA Times, in which he says that the death of Bill's wife and son led to his \"unstable mental condition in later decades.\" What rot. Burroughs was very sane, and very brave, and in my opinion a profoundly decent man. I think it is very sane to face one's demons, as Burroughs did daily. It seems odd to describe such fearlessness as instability. Perhaps Perry needs to see a shrink. Anyway, now that i've vented spleen on the back-stabbing obits writers, let me say that the likes of Burroughs will never be seen again, and i will miss him. i hope wherever you are, Mr. Burroughs, there are no Shits, only Johnsons.\n\nvan yasek <vyasek@wvnvm.wvnet.edu>\n\n- Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 08:59:37 (EDT)\n\nBilly boy o billy boy\n\nyou did it again we knew you would\n\njust not how\n\nnow that you have i know\n\nfor you the day was 2\n\nfor we in oz it was 3\n\n23 t w e n t y t h r e e\n\nyou did it again we knew you would\n\nthanx billy boy thanx\n\nCharles Roberts <catacomb@taunet.net.au>\n\nDarwin, NT 0820 - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 08:41:00 (EDT)\n\nI expect to see the Mars probe transmit a picture of a huge\n\nrock, and a fedora sitting on top...awaiting.\n\nRIP, bull...Burrough's work has just begun.\n\nJohn Gregorio <Subterr7@aol.com>\n\nDenver, CCO USA - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 08:03:45 (EDT)\n\nThin man\n\nThin man\n\nI do know your death\n\nThin man\n\nThin man\n\nPlease light up fires of death\n\nThin man\n\nThin man\n\nOur dead rows feel all alone\n\nSkies fell down upon our homes\n\n...\n\n...\n\nGet the fuck outta here, man\n\n...

The honesty of his writings was just some of the coolest stuff I had ever read, having been raised on Nancy Drew Mysteries, and the other garbage that the public school system throws at young people.\n\nAs time went on, I became well versed in Burroughs literature, and even have copies of most of his experimental films.\n\nNow that I think about it, on Sunday I rented Chappaqua, so there's a sort of poetic irony I am experiencing about this sudden turn of events.\n\nI am indeed saddened by this news.\n\nSam Atakra\n\nSam Atakra <atakra@humboldt1.com>\n\narcata, ca usa - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 04:24:39 (EDT) The man is dead, but his work will surely live on testifying the truth of our disjointed, pre-Apocalyptic age. If the USA has a writer for the 21st century it is WSB (what is the cut up, if not literary \"channel surfing\"?). Burroughs understood, and was able to inventively express, the chaos of post-modernity decades before the mainstream ever realized it. (It seems an ugly paradox that his work is currently embraced for its darkness when Burroughs was acting like a literary surgeon, diagnosing society's malignancies in order to free humankind.\n\nTo have the nightmares themselves embraced as new drugs for a myth-addicted society would have surprised cyncial ol'Bill, but I bet it saddened him.)\n\nThough linked to the Beats, Burroughs was his own movement -- renegade, fire-starter, shape-shifter, and, perversely enough, a moralist. I think of WSB as a literary shaman who tried heal us from the wounds of birth and death; Nature and Society.\n\nLike all shaman, he was a social misfit and pereninally misunderstood or demonized by the mainstream (witness the horrid LA TIMES obituary). This iconoclastic Seeker pursued his role to the end with the dignity of the dedicated Artist, the courage of the paradigm-shifting Scientist, and the fertile creativity of The Genius.\n\nFor good or ill, we are all living in a Naked Lunch world.\n\nThe blazing, one-of-a-kind mind of William S. Burroughs was a lamp guiding us through the shit blackness of our waking nightmare. Now that lamp is out forever.\n\nNothing I say can fully express the utter originality of this Great American Artist -- nobody before him had done what he did until he did it.\n\nWhen the Universe put those neurons together, it threw away the mold.\n\nI love you, Uncle Bill.

Standing in the local drugstore small town midwest looking over the cheap paperbacks. Image of a sweaty t-shirt clad addict slumped down, title: JUNKIE. Reasonably priced attractive trash I figure and purchase. Only to discover upon reading hey hey a minor masterpiece, and the beginning of an education, probably like most of you kiddos, I needed out. 2. Boulder, Colorado mid-nineteen seventies, in a hip bookstore. I notice the grey suit, the grey flesh, the stiff movements of a man who I have by now consummed every word published and studied every photo as if he were a rock star. I do not to intrude. Never intrude. What is there to say? But I am curious. I wonder what Mr Burroughs will purchase for his own consumption. I lurk around to see. After a short time he walks out with the current issue of The Farmers Almanac under his arm. I decide to go to Naropa and sign up for his writing workshops. Also, to this day I pick up the Almanac and gaze for meaning. 3. Burroughs coughs, and in that famous reptilian voice croaks out a fairly standard lecture on the art of writing filmscripts. Says you can probably make a good film from a bad book but don't try it the other way around. It is far more his humor and demenor than the content that make the class interesting. Recently I read he concluded that his teaching writing was a total failure. 4. The standard live readings at Naropa were pretty tedious even then. For every Ginsberg and Ann Waldman you had 5 bad imitations prattling on for hours. But there was only one William. Well, not true. There were two. The other was his son, William \"Billy\" Jr. Who generally was a comlete but very sweet wreak. But a very interesting writer. The reading they gave together was one of the best ever. Soon after Billy was in the hospital in Denver for a liver transplant. 5. Through Denver poet Bill Ward I was introduced to Billy. Billy's two autobiographical books, Speed and Kentucky Ham chronicled his (and my own generations) decent into drugs and alcohol when he/we took the romanticism of the 'beats' too literally. Billy sometimes read at a local reading series run by Ward. One night afterwards, we had a birthday party for him. There he talked of his father with great love, at the same time mentioning his parents various addictions at the time of his birth. He said he was told it had been a difficult labor. He looked at us for a while and then spoke quietly, \"I didn't want to be born.\" Billy was dead within the year. 6. I never went to see William Sr. read again, tho I read all the books he wrote as they were published and collected the recordings. I was happy to see his paintings, his move to Kansas. But somehow my time with Billy and that sad statement words made me much more ambivilent towards my Willaim and all my previous 'heros'. 7. The days of our lives, filled now with those once so called obscene science fiction slashed books become rapid truths. Say hello to Billy for me and we will watch for you in the eyes of little fresh kitties born again and again.\n\nLivingston <SonOfNaugha@AOL.com>\n\nBaltimore, MD USA - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 02:24:28 (EDT)\n\n(in Euc)\n\n¤Ê¤¼¤Ê¤éÈà¤ÏÌ´¤ò¸«¤Æ¤¤¤¿¤«¤é\n\nÀ¤³¦¤Î½ª¤ï¤ê¤Ë\n\nÃÏµå¤Î¤Ï¤¸¤Þ¤ê¤«¤é¤Ä¤Å¤¯\n\nÂÀ¸Å¤ÎÌ´¤ò¸«¤Æ¤¤¤¿¤«¤é\n\n»à¤Ë¤¤¤¿¤ëÃ»¤¤»þ¤ÎÎ®¤ì¤Ë\n\n²æ¤é¤¬²¿½è¤«¤é½Ð¤Ç\n\n²¿½è¤ØÌá¤Ã¤Æ¹Ô¤¯¤«¤ò\n\n¤È¤Æ¤â¼ª´·¤ì¤Æ¤¤¤ë¤¬¸Î¤Ë\n\n¤Ä¤¤Ê¹¤­Æ¨¤·¤Æ¤·¤Þ¤¦¤è¤¦¤Ê\n\n¤³¤È¤Ð¤òÊØ¤ê¤Ë\n\n½ñ¤­µ­¤ë¤¹\n\nÆüËÜ¤Î¤³¤È¤Ð¤Ç¤Ï\n\n½ÐÍè¤Ê¤¤¤«¡©\n\nss Higashi <foe4foe@aol.com>\n\nLos Alamos, Uranus - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 02:20:25 (EDT)\n\nOld Bull Lee\n\nYou took your last trip\n\nI hope it was a good one\n\nI will always remeber you...\n\nMarko Korvela <marko.korvela@chydenius.fi>\n\nKokkola, Finland - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 02:19:59 (EDT)\n\nMay you finally find your finger, and adjust your shot accordingly.\n\nPeter McCarty <peterc@inlink.com>\n\nSt. Louis, MO USA - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 01:59:56 (EDT)\n\ni´m so sad\n\nhector <hbuitrag@colomsat.net.co>\n\nbogota, colombia - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 01:32:11 (EDT)\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Sonnet 27\n\nHelena <helenam@concentric.net>\n\n- Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 01:25:48 (EDT)\n\nThank you Bill, for being one of the few who taught me the power of words.\n\nEling <eling@xs4all.nl>\n\nNijmegen, Netherlands - Tuesday, August 05, 1997 at 01:23:38 (EDT)\n\nRegretably, I never met him.
