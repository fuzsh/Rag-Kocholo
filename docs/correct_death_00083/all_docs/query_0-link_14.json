Hunt (1856-1934) [I updated this with some dates and links]\n\n- Written by his granddaughter Mildred Henson:\n\n“Grandpa Hunt was born in Missouri and Grandma in Illinois (Mary Jane Crow). They bore three daughters; my mother, Bessie May, and Janie [Tanie] and Hettie. My Aunt Hettie married Elmer Jones and they, with Grandma and Grandpa, came to Alberta somewhere near Cash Creek. Aunt Hettie died in childbirth and the baby was also lost.\n\n“Grandpa then moved to Boyle on a quarter, Daddy later proved up as a homestead. My parents [Bessie (Hunt) and Angus Henson] came up from the United States too, and wer living on the same place and sharing their accommodations. When our house burned down from a stove-pipe fire and all our possessions were destroyed they moved to a quarter just west of Boyle. The trees on the building site still stand, on the south side of the road. (The place was later owned by Peter Hutzel.)\n\n“Grandpa never had good health and he passed away in the late 1920's. Grandma then moved back to the Henson yard to a little log cabin built for her by Daddy and the neighbors. (I can still remember the excitement of the 'building bee'.) Grandma was there until her passing in the early 1930's She was bedridden for several years and in those years there was no money to pay large hospital bills and no government nursing homes. They were both buried in the Boyle Cemetery.\n\n“Grandpa did love to sing the old gospel songs. [A] picture was taken in his yard on Sunday when some of the neighbors and our family gathered for a sing-song and a visit. They lived quietly with respect for God and their fellow man. “\n\n- Written by a descendant of Daniel Hunt:\n\n“My g-grandfather, Daniel Hunt, was a brother of your Jonathan Hunt. My grandfather, Marion Dee Hunt and first wife, Nellie, were in Beaver Co., OK, early 1900s, when your ancestor, Joseph Alex 'Alec' Hunt was there and from what I have seen Alec and Grandpa Dee evidently worked together on the building of a church there. Nellie died there in 1904 and the body was returned to the Hunt family cemetery in Round Grove, MO. Grandpa ended up later returning permanently to Missouri and married my grandmother in 1910.”\n\n- Family story:\n\n“Hunt went a hunting and got a Crow!” [from V Lucas]\n\n- Published in a Beaver County History Book, Volume I, pg 273 [my comments added]:\n\nJoseph Alex Hunt\n\nJoseph Alex Hunt was born in Lawrence County, Missouri, on May 13, 1860. [SW corner of MO, west of Springfield and south of Lockwood; included Mt Vernon and Aurora] He took as his bride Miss Mary Jane Crow who was born August 18, 1856, at Peoria County, Illinois, on December 1, 1880. To this union four children were born in Lawrence Coutny, Missouri, Clarence E. who died in infancy, Foncie Sultana (Tanie), Bessie and Hettie.\n\nBeing a carpenter by trade Joseph Alex and Mary decided to move their family to “No Man’s Land” [the OK panhandle] in Beaver County, Oklahoma [at the base of the OK panhandle in NW OK, with KS to the north and TX to the south; included towns of Beaver, Elmwood, Balko, Turpin, Floris, Forgan...]. They came by train in 1902 to Canadian, Texas [not too far south of Beaver Co OK, and NE of Amarillo TX], where they were met by relatives from the South Flat community. They lived on a farm owned by a cousin Tanie Poland. Alex Hunt, as he was know by all who knew him, with the help of others built the Eight Square Building or “Roundtop” on the Poland land. She donated the plot for the community cemetery. This building was on the north side of the present Sophia Cemetery, and was used for worship and as a community center for many years.\n\nTheir home was a frame house and half-dugout. Most of their supplies were bought in nearby country stores at Sophia and La Kemp, Oklahoma. Other supplies were freighted from Higgins and Glazier, Texas. Ther main source of fuel for cooking and heating was cow chips, kaffir corn and maize when coal was not availabe. Their neighbors were Lush Toben, Wesley Jenkins and Hershel Allen.\n\nBessie, Tanie and Hettie attended school at Old Soddy which was located across the road west of the Joe Getz home. Tanie finished her last years of school at the Elmwood School and made her home with the Billy Overton family on Clear Creek. Upon graduation and passing of the county examination, she was issued a teaching certificate and taught school in the Gray, Oklahoma community. It was during this term of teaching school that her parents decided to move, leaving her behind to finish out her term of teaching.\n\nAlex decided to move his family to Boyle, Alberta, Canada, in 1910. Bessie and Angus Henson were married and accompanied her parents and younger sister Hettie to Canada where they all homesteaded. Their land was practically as far north as the roads permitted them to go in the wooded area. Here they cleared the timber and built their log cabins. Hettie married Elmer Jones December 18, 1913, and died in childbirth November 4, 1914, at Boyle Alberta, Canada.\n\nAlex Hunt farmed and improved his place until his death September 18, 1928. Mrs. Hunt was cared for by her daughter Bessie and children until her death June 12, 1934.\n\nOn April 15, 1911, Froncie Sultana (Tanie) was united in marriage to Herbert R Hibbs. To this union four children were born, Paschal O Hibbs, Delia Mae Rose, Helen Eileen Slovacek and Ivan Leroy Hibbs. After marrying and raising her own family, Tanie never had the opportunity to see her parents again, but in 1945 she and her husband drove to Canada and saw her sister Bessie after thirty-five years of separation. This was indeed a joyous occasion. She visited her parent’s graves and took pictures of her parents’ first Canadian log cabin which is still standing, though unused.\n\nTanie and Herbert lived at “Hibbs Corner,” now known as Elmwood Oklalhoma, for several years, and then they moved to Balko until they retired in 1959 and moved to Beavr. Tanie passed away June 4, 1966.\n\nPaschal O “Pack” Hibbs was united in marriage to Louela Smith. To this union two children were born, Leon and Connie Lou.\n\nDelia Mae married Homer Rose, they live at Buxton, Oregon.\n\nHelen Eileen Hibbs married Frank Slovacek. They lived on a farm in the South Flat community. They have two sons, Calvin and Jimmy Dale.\n\nIvan Leroy married Eloise Hancock. They have two daughters, Micki Jo and Kay Lynn.\n\nSubmitted by Helen Slovacek.\n\n- From another researcher:\n\nDPL -- LAWRENCE COUNTY MISSOURI HISTORY, Pub. Law. Co. Hist. Soc., p 481\n\nJOHN HUNT (bio by Reva (Hunt) West)\n\n\"4. Jonathan, 1823-1905, Baptist Minister, married Elizabeth Poland, they had 8 children. 2nd wife was Malinda S. Poland, ... sister to Elizabeth ... Malinda & Jonathan had 7 children: ...\n\nH. Joseph A., (b) 1860. Jonathan and Malinda's children were: I.
