        "text": "One of the last links to the beat generation has been broken.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, author of Naked\n\nLunch and Junkie died Saturday at age 83 after\n\nsuffering a heart attack.\n\nThe son of a successful St. Louis businessman, Burroughs\n\ngraduated from Harvard University in 1938 and eventually made his\n\nway to New York City where he befriended a circle of drifters and\n\nstudents that included Allen Ginsberg, Jack\n\nKerouac and Neal Cassady. Burroughs,\n\nfirst immortalized as Old Bull Lee in Kerouac’s On the\n\nRoad, moved to Texas with his wife, Joan, in 1946.\n\nAfter accidentally shooting and killing his wife in a\n\ndrug-addled stage, Burroughs penned Junkie, then\n\ndisappeared to Tangier, Morocco where he wrote Naked\n\nLunch. Originally published in 1959, but banned in the United\n\nStates until 1962, Naked Lunch, with its offbeat monikers\n\nand cut-up aesthetic, has since become a primary inspiration for\n\nlater literary and musical movements such as cyberpunk, punk rock\n\nand hip-hop.\n\nBurroughs bounced around for the next two decades, battling\n\nheroin addiction and publishing sporadically. He briefly found a\n\nhome back in New York City during the punk era of the late ’70s. In\n\n1981, Burroughs moved to Lawrence, Kan., where he lived out the\n\nrest of his life.\n\nTrending\n\nBy now a cultural icon, Burroughs appeared in a number of films,\n\nincluding the award-winning Drugstore Cowboy and the big\n\nscreen version of Naked Lunch. He produced several\n\nspoken-word albums, collaborated with popular musicians including\n\nThe Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and the late\n\nKurt Cobain.\n\nBurroughs’ only son, William, died in 1981."
