        "text": "Beat author William Burroughs dies at 83\n\n1997 - Beat generation writer William S. Burroughs, the counterculture author best known for the novel Naked Lunch based on his experiences as a drug addict, died at the age of 83. Burroughs died at Lawrence Memorial Hospital a day after suffering a heart attack. Along with the poet Allen Ginsberg and other writers such as Jack Kerouac and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Burroughs came to embody the bohemian, anti-establishment beat generation literary movement. The controversial Burroughs spent years as a drug addict and accidentally killed his wife. In later years, he achieved cult status among a generation of disaffected middle-class youth.\n\nAugust 2\n\n1824 - Turkey captures island of Psara from the Greeks.\n\n1847 - William A.
