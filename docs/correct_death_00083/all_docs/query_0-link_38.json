CHANDLER, claim agent of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad, and the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, located in the city of Madison, Dane County, WI, was born in Fryeburg, Oxford County, ME, 01 Nov 1824, son of Hon. Josephus and Sarah (COLBY) CHANDLER, who were natives of the same place. By occupation the father was a farmer and our subject was reared to agricultural pursuits. He attended the common schools and this was supplemented by a few terms at the Freyburgh Academy, a place of learning known over the country because its first preceptor was the great Daniel WEBSTER.\n\nOur subject became a manager of some public works in the city of Lawrence [Essex County, MA] at the age of 19, also in the city of Lowell [in Middlesex County; or possibly \"Lowell Junction\" in Essex County], MA. He was engaged in railroad work at an early age on the Maine Central, and then on the Androscoggin & Kennebec, and still afterward on the Grand Trunk. He continued in that line until the road was carried into Canada, in 1852. In 1854 he came to WI and located on a farm in Madison Township, Dane County.\n\nThe parents of our subject, Josephus and Sarah (COLBY) CHANDLER, had come here in 1852, locating in Primrose Township, Dane County, WI, and while living here the father had represented his township on the county board; Josephus CHANDLER was a man of prominence, having been a member of the ME Legislature. Sarah (COLBY) CHANDLER, the mother of our subject, died when Joseph C. CHANDLER was but four years of age, and he was her only son. The father, Josephus CHANDLER, remarried and had a family of five children by his second union, three boys and two girls; he died in Primrose Township, Dane County, WI, in 1858.\n\nJoseph C. CHANDLER remained on the farm in Madison Township, Dane County, WI, but sold that farm and then bought another near Judge BRYANT's place. Later he sold this and bought the place where he has lived for the past 30 years, and from that time he has been in the employ of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad and also the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad as their claim agent and the manager of the commissary department in the buying of wood and coal. He removed to the city of Madison, Dane County, WI, in 1862, and has resided here almost ever since he came to the State, excepting a few years in Stoughton [Dane County], WI. For the past six or seven years he has been a member of the Board of Supervisors of the 6th Ward of the city of Madison. In politics Joseph C. CHANDLER is a very outspoken Democrat. In religion he leans toward the Universalist faith, believing firmly in the carrying out of the Golden Rule in life.\n\nJoseph C. CHANDLER was married in Fryeburg, [Oxford County], ME, in Dec 1852, to Miss Sarah E. THOMAS, of Conway, [County], NH, born in the same place. They have had three children: Sarah, born 15 Jan 1854 in NH, died 15 Jul 1885; Alice, born in Nov 1858 in WI, who was spared for 22 years; and Charles N., born in May 1855, in WI, who was for five years before his death, in Apr 1890, at the age of 35 years, ticket agent for the Northwestern Railroad Company at Madison, WI.\n\nWI BIO - Dane Co - CHANDLER, Joseph C.
