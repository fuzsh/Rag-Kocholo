        "text": "Chapter 3:\n\nGeneration 5\n\nJohn Bramlett and Mary Peak\n\nMore than sixty family members from the Palmetto State served as soldiers in the Civil War/War Between the States, and at least eighteen died while defending Confederate and Southern principles. One particular family from Greenville County headed by Sarah Dacus and Rev. Reuben Bramlett in John and Mary’s line boasted twenty sons and grandsons serving in a variety of units at various times during the conflict.\n\nSouth Carolina State Seal and Motto: While I Breathe I Hope\n\nFather John Bramlett, child of Margaret “Peggy” Unknown and Henry Bramlett Jr., was born May 15, 1764, on the family plantation in Fauquier Co., Va. He married Mary Peak there circa 1785. Their first child was born in 1786 in South Carolina. John and Mary first lived in Laurens County, where he was a co-founder and early charter member of Bramlett Methodist Church with his mother, Margaret, and brothers Henry III and Nathan.\n\nJohn’s full birth and death dates are inscribed in a Bramlett Bible owned by his descendants and on his tombstone at Bethel United Methodist Church, Simpsonville, Greenville Co., S.C. The monument indicates he was born in Virginia. He died at age 91 on July 28, 1855, at home on his farm south of Greenville, S.C., next to his church, and rests beside his wife, Mary Peak, there, at Bethel Methodist Episcopal (now Bethel United Methodist) Church Cemetery. One side of John’s tombstone is inscribed “John Bramlett Born Virginia May 15, 1764. Died July 28, 1855. Mary Peak His wife May 16, 1763 June 23, 1853.” The other side of the monument memorializes “Susan His Daughter” and praises “John Bramlett For 73 Years A Leader in Christian Work” and “The founder Of Bethel Church. He Had The Witness That He Pleased God.”\n\nBethel United Methodist Church circa 1900\n\nForty three names signed on an undated petition to request state incorporation of Bethel Methodist Church, Arbor, and Campground in Greenville County, South Carolina, including Bramletts, Burdetts, Austins, Hollands. The church served several thousand members annually.\n\nBramlett United Methodist Church\n\n2043 Bramlett Church Road\n\nGray Court 29645\n\nLaurens County\n\nSouth Carolina USA\n\nBramlett United Methodist Church was co-founded in 1780 or 1781, according to Father John Bramlett, by him, his mother, Margaret Bramlett, and one or two of her other sons, “Nathan and or Henry” (III). The church still holds services on the property deeded by Nathan Bramlett and George Sims and sold to the trustees for $5 in 1807.\n\nJohn and Mary moved their family from Laurens County where his mother, Margaret, and siblings Marianne and Nathan were living, to about nine miles from Bramlett Methodist Episcopal Church, across the boundary line into Greenville County, in 1797, the year their daughter Mildred was born there at Bethel Camp Ground. There they donated land John owned for the construction of Bethel Arbor and Church and for establishment of the Cemetery, which dates back to the the first death in the Bramlett, Holland or Yeargin families after they all settled in the same location. John’s home was next to the Church and the Arbor, an outdoor shelter used for early religious meetings and special occasions, including revivals and weddings. Bethel honors John each year by laying a wreath on his grave during its Founder’s Day celebrations. Co-founders Solomon Holland and Devereaux Yeargin with their family members also played important roles in the establishment and early development of the Arbor, Church, and Cemetery.\n\nJohn also co-founded with his mother, Margaret, and siblings Henry III and Nathan, the mother church of Bethel –Bramlett Methodist Episcopal (now United Methodist) Church– near Gray Court, Laurens Co., S.C., in 1780-1781 or earlier. Obituaries of John and Nathan document their early membership in the Methodist Church at age 16 in and age 14, respectfully. They formed the core religious group of Bramlett Methodist Church with their mother, Margaret, and elder brother Henry III, who was about age 25, in 1780-1781 at their widowed mother Margaret’s home, on the Bramlett Plantation in Fauquier Co., Va. No religious affiliation has been identified for their brother Reuben Bramlett, 1757-1844, who was born in Virginia, lived there in 1780-85, and then moved to South Carolina, Western Kentucky, and Southern Illinois where he died and is buried. His wife, Elizabeth Brown, and several of their family members, including sons Henry and Coleman; however, were devoted to the Baptist Church in Gallatin and Saline counties in Illinois. Elizabeth is listed as a member on the rolls of one early Baptist Church there that notes her death in 1830. Family tradition holds she and her son Ben both died of measles at about the same time. One Laurens County, South Carolina, historian dated the founding of Bramlett Methodist Church at Gray Court, S.C., back to 1774-1776, around the time of the Declaration of Independence. John and Nathan were revered lay ministers given the title “Father” by their adoring congregants in South Carolina and, with their elder brother Henry III, were deeply devoted to God, Church, Country, and Family. Henry III’s descendants on the West Coast some years ago claimed they had documentary written evidence, perhaps a copy of his license to preach, church documents, or letters, indicating he was an ordained Methodist Minister; and they had possession of and had preserved his very valuable and historically important Revolutionary War Discharge Papers. Although many of Henry III’s descendants are interested in joining military and history groups to celebrate their family patriotic affiliations, the owner of the preserved items declined to share copies of them or give permission to quote written history that describes them. However, those descendants may use Henry III’s identification as a Revolutionary soldier in Georgia Land Lottery records and in a Virginia deed that names him as a resident of Virginia and South Carolina in 1780, during the war, for proof of their ancestor’s military service. Henry III’s daughter Margaret joined Bramlett Methodist Church when the family still lived in South Carolina, and his sister Marianne Bramlett and her husband, Frederick Burdette, were no doubt also affiliated with Bramlett Methodist Church as early members. Frederick served as a trustee there in 1807, and they lived nearby and close to Marianne’s paternal uncle William Bramblett and family. They are named as early church members in Rev. Frederick Reuben Burdette’s precious family Diary, provided by direct descendant Martha Anne Curry Duke. The document records names of the church’s founders in 1780 or 1781 as brothers Henry III, John, Nathan Bramlett, and their Mother, who is identified as Margaret in recorded Virginia deeds that name Henry III, John, and Reuben together on the Fauquier Co., Va., plantation, after their father, Henry II/Jr., died.\n\nBramlett United Methodist Church, founded 1780-1781\n\nJohn Bramlett’s Tombstone, Bethel United Methodist Church Cemetery, Simpsonville, S.C.\n\n“B”\n\n“John Bramlett Born Virginia May 15, 1764.

Dennis\n\nBethel United Methodist Church, Simpsonville, S.C.\n\nJohn and Mary’s Thirteen Children\n\nThe names and birth dates of John and Mary and their thirteen children are inscribed in their son Elias Bramlett’s Bible and their son Reuben Bramlett’s Bible, the latter which was once in the possession of Robert Hulet/Hugh Bramlett, grandson of John and Mary, and later was passed down to Robert’s son H. Marvin Bramlett and then to his son Robert Austin Bramlett. John and Mary’s thirteen children are William, Margaret, Nathan, Nancy, Reuben, Alcey, John Wesley, Mildred (“Milley”), Rosanah (“Rosey” “Rosa”), Mary, Henry, Susannah (“Susan”) and Elias Bramlett. Several of the children appear to be namesakes of John’s extended family members: William, named after John’s brother? and/or uncle; Margaret, named after John’s mother; Nathan and Reuben and Henry, named after John’s brothers Nathan, Reuben and Henry; and perhaps Nancy, named after a probable sister of John. John Wesley Bramlett was named in part after John and after the famous Methodist leader John Wesley. Mary was named after her mother. The other daughters–Alcey, Milley, Rosanah “Rosey” “Rosa” and Susannah “Susan”–may have been named after some of John’s sisters who have not been documented and/or after some of Mary’s family.\n\nJohn and Mary’s Thirteen Children are: William, Margaret, Nathan, Nancy, Reuben, Alcey, John Wesley, Mildred (“Milley”), Rosanah (“Rosey” “Rosa”), Mary, Henry, Susannah (“Susan”), Elias Bramlett.\n\nRev. William Bramlett, Son of John and Mary Peak Bramlett\n\nDescendant James T. Hammond of Columbia and Greenville, S.C., pictured below, provides much of the following about Rev. William and Nancy S. Dacus Bramlett.\n\nRev. William Bramlett, first child of John and Mary (Peak) Bramlett, was born July 2, 1786, in Laurens Co., S.C. William’s birth and death dates are inscribed in a Bramlett Bible originally owned by William’s brother Reuben. William died July 29, 1870, at home in Jackson Grove, Greenville Co., S.C., and was buried in Jackson Grove Methodist Church Cemetery. William’s son-in-law Willis Rogers petitioned to be administrator of William’s estate on Jan. 28, 1871 (Apt. 32, File 56). William’s son John Wesley Irvin Bramlett and William’s widow, Nancy, bought most of William’s property at the estate sale, according to descendant James T. Hammond.\n\nWilliam was appointed trustee of Jackson Grove Methodist Church in 1835. He previously was a charter member and trustee of Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church near Simpsonville, S.C. J. C. Crisp identifies William as a Methodist Minister in an obituary published in the Sept. 23, 1870, issue of The Southern Christian Advocate:\n\nBramlett descendant Julien Potter Wooten in his 1886 brief family history named William as a son of John and Mary. Julien described William as “a Methodist preacher” who “lived and died in Greenville, S.C.” (See the entire typescript/transcript below in Mildred Bramlett Potter’s history.) William is the brother of Mildred Bramlett Potter, who is the grandmother of Julien.)\n\nMethodist Church historian Samuel M. Green in An Historical Outline of Greenville Circuit writes about William Bramlett who lived in the upper part of Greenville County near Batesville and preached at Ebenezer Methodist Church. He indicates William assisted the Rev. Thomas Hutchings, “a Methodist local preacher…who was the original proprietor of the Batesville cotton factory. Through their efforts, church meetings were held for workers and proprietors of the Batesville and Pelham cotton factories” (10). (Batesville and Pelham originally were known as Buena Vista.) Buried in the cemetery at Ebenezer Methodist Church, where William H. Bramlett preached, are Arthur Bramlett (1), and Lilla Mae Bramlett (2), according to Beverly T. Whitmire in Presence of The Past. Their graves apparently are not marked or the markers have no dates. Their connection to William is unknown.\n\nWilliam married Nancy S. Dacus in 1803 in Greenville County, according to descendant Louise (Hutchings) Galway, deceased. She reported Nancy was born May 16, 1788, in Virginia. Nancy is the daughter of Nathaniel Dacus and his first wife, Martha Dupree, who married in Lunenburg Co., Va. Family tradition holds that Nancy is Nathaniel’s step-daughter, the child of Martha Dupree and a different father; however, recent DNA results contributed by direct descendant James T. Hammond indicate Nancy is genetically and biologically related to Sarah D. Dacus Bramlett, her sister, who also is a known daughter of Martha Dupree and Nathaniel Dacus. Nancy died in Jackson Grove, S.C., on March 13, 1874. Her grave marker in Jackson Grove Methodist Church Cemetery identifies her as the wife of Rev. William Bramlett.\n\n“William Bramblet,” 26-44, is listed in the 1810 U.S. Census for Greenville Co., S.C., as head of a family that includes a female 26-44 (wife, Nancy) and two children: a female under 10, born 1800-10 (Mary?), and a male under 10, born 1800-10 (Nathan Robert/Josiah?) (NARA Film M252:62:118). “Wm. Bramlet,” white male 26-44, born between 1776 and 1794, employed in agriculture, is listed in the 1820 U.S. Census for Greenville Co., S.C., with a female 26-44 (wife, Nancy) and six children: one female 10-16, born between 1804 and 1810 (Mary); two males under 10, born between 1810 and 1820 (Nathan Robert/Josiah? and/or Abner G., Tolliver Robert); and three females under 10, born between 1810 and 1820 (Margaret/Anna? and Elizabeth and Melanie “Mellie” “Milly”?) (NARA Film M33:120:169). One of the sons may have been missed by the census taker or may have been living with other relatives. Four young children, probably grandchildren–children of William and Nancy–are enumerated with William’s parents, John and Mary, in the 1820 census. Another son of William and Nancy, Elbert S., had died in 1819. William lived near his parents, John and Mary (Peak/e) Bramlett, in Greenville County in 1830. “William Bramlet,” 40-50, is listed in the 1830 U.S. Census for Greenville Co., S.C., as head of a family that includes a female 40-50 (wife, Nancy) and nine children: a female 20-30, born 800-10 (Mary); two females 15-20, born 1811-15 (Elizabeth “Betsy” and Melanie “Mellie” “Milly”?); one female 10-15, born 1815-20 (Margaret/Anna?); one male 10-15, born 1815-20 (Tolliver Robert); one female 5-10, born 1820-25 (Martha); one male 5-10, born 1820-25 (William H.); one female under 5, born 1825-30 (Eliza W.); and one male under 5, born between 1825 and 1830 (John Wesley Ervin) (NARA Film M19:172:284). Sons Nathan Robert/Josiah and Abner G. may have been living with relatives: their grandparents John and Mary (Peak) Bramlett have one male 15-20, born between 1810 and 1815 (Nathan?); and one male 10-15, born between 1815 and 1820 (Abner G.?) in their house in the 1830 census.\n\nNathan Bramlett married Mary Margaret Miles by 1835, and Abner G. Bramlett married Elizabeth Rosa Hawkins in 1843. Two of Nancy and William’s three older daughters (Mary and/or Margaret/Anna and Melanie “Mellie” “Milly”?) married before 1840. William and Nancy’s son Tolliver Robert Bramlett married before 1840 and lived next to them.\n\n“Rev. Wm. Bramblett,” 50-60, born 1780-90, is listed in the 1840 U.S. Census for Greenville Co., S.C., as head of a family that includes a female 50-60 (wife, Nancy) and eight children: one male 20-30, born 1810-20 (Abner G.); two females 20-30, born 1810-20 (Margaret/Anna? or Melanie “Mellie” “Milly”? and Elizabeth “Betsy”); one female 15-20, born 1820-25 (Martha); one male 15-20, born 1820-25 (William H.); one female 10-15, born 1825-30 (Eliza W.); one male 10-15, born 1825-30 (John Wesley Ervin); and one female 5-10, born 1830-35 (Malinda Caroline) (NARA Film M704:512:205). (Nathan does not appear with his parents and siblings in 1840 because he married by 1835 and lived elsewhere. Abner did not marry until 1843.) “William Bramblett,” 64, born in South Carolina, farmer, $300 real estate, and wife, Nancy, 62, born in Virginia, are listed in the 1850 U.S. Census for Greenville Co., S.C., with six grown children: Elizabeth (“Betsy”), 30; Martha, 28; William (H.), 25, laborer; Eliza (W.), 23; John (Wesley Ervin), 21, laborer; and (Malinda) Caroline, 18 (NARA Film M432:853:367A). “Wm. Bramblett” is listed in the Sept. 6, 1850, Agricultural Census for Greenville Co., S.C., with fifty improved acres and fifty-five unimproved acres worth $300 and $200 worth of livestock (SCDAH Film M2:1:734-735). William Bramlett circa 1855 signed a petition to erect a gate on the road from Greenville Courthouse (SCDAH Series S165015, Item 31). Other signers include William H. Bramlett Jr., John W. Bramlett, William Few. “William Bramlett,” 74, born in South Carolina, Methodist clergyman, $1,000 real estate, $200 personal estate, and wife, Nancy, 72, born in Virginia, housekeeper, are listed in the 1860 U.S. Census for Mush Creek P.O., Head of Tyger Div., Greenville Co., S.C., with three grown children born in South Carolina: Elizabeth Bramlett, 48, seamstress; Martha Bramlett, 41, seamstress; and Eliza Miles, 32, housekeeper, $1,600 personal estate (NARA Film M653:1220:506). Also listed is Eliza’s son John T. Miles, 5. “W. [William] Bramlett,” 84, and wife, Nancy, 82, keeping house, both born in South Carolina, are listed in the 1870 U.S. Census for Mush Creek P.O., Highland Twp., Greenville Co., S.C. (NARA Film M593:1498:675B).\n\nHeadstone of Mary Bramlett Few, Few Family Cemetery, courtesy Robin Farley Dixson\n\nElizabeth R. Bramlett made a motion to the chancellor through her solicitor to admit the will to probate, which was granted, and was named Executrix on Jan. 29, 1873.\n\nAbner named his wife, Elizabeth R., and four daughters as his only heirs: Emily Dacus (Bramlett) Dacus, Louisa Josephine Bramlett, Nancy R. Bramlett and Mary E. Bramlett.\n\nWilliam H. (Henry?) Bramlett, tenth child of Rev. William and Nancy S. (Dacus) Bramlett, was born April 19, 1824, in Greenville Co., S.C. An entry in his Bramlett Bible, once in the possession of descendant Boyce Bramlett, indicates “W. H. Bramlett Departed this life Oct. 6th 1863 at 1/2 past 6 o’clock in the evening at the Ropers hospital in Charleston, S.C.” He died while serving as a Confederate soldier during the Civil War/War Between the States, reportedly of typhoid fever. A soldier in his unit indicated in a letter the captain sent William back to Greenville County to be buried in Jackson Grove Methodist Church Cemetery where a grave is marked for him. (Victims of typhoid and other communicable diseases usually were buried right away in their uniforms at the place of death; however, there is no inscribed tombstone or burial record for him at Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston where deceased soldiers were interred.) A neighbor, James Irvin Willis, who served in William’s unit, Company H, Third Palmetto Battalion, South Carolina Light Artillery, mentions William in two letters he wrote to his father, Daniel Willis, and to his father and mother in 1863. The first letter, written March 6, 1863, from Camp James Island, S.C., contains a brief reference: “…Wm. Bramlett has come to our Co….” William had enlisted in February. Willis identifies their company at the bottom of the letter. He tells his father, “You directed your letter to Co. A. That was a mistake. Ours is Co. H.” An earlier reference near the top of the letter indicates the company had four artillery guns. William subsequently became ill and was hospitalized June 12, 1863. A second Willis letter, written Oct. 19, 1863, also from James Island, S.C., contains the news of William’s death: “There was one of my mess died of typhoid…his name was Wm. Bramlett…a neighbor of mine. Left a wife and five little children. He said before he died he was prepared…” and Captain McKendrick sent him home. The letters were preserved by Willis descendant Rev. J. Earnest Willis and published. The excerpts here are shared by Bramblette-Burdette-Willis descendant Franklin Donald Burdette of Florida.\n\nWilliam married Rebecca Arvine Roe on Dec. 8, 1853, according to the Bramlett Bible. Rebecca was born Dec. 6, 1830, in Greenville District, the daughter of Ann Wheeler (1795-1846) and Thomas Roe (1791-1847). Rebecca died March 28, 1907, in Greenville County and was buried in Jackson Grove Methodist Church Cemetery. Her maternal grandparents are Phillis Biden and William Wheeler and her paternal grandparents are Elizabeth Daish (1769-1848) and James Roe Jr. (1766-1826). Rebecca Bramlett of Locust Hill, S.C., in 1901 is listed by Mann Batson in Upper Part of Greenville County, South Carolina, as one of the “Widows Of Soldiers Who Lost Their Lives In Service Of The Confederate States” (453).\n\nWilliam wrote his last will and testament on Nov. 22, 1862, in Greenville District:\n\nIn the name of God Amen. I William H. Bramlett of the State of South Carolina, Greenville dist, being of sound and disposing mind and memory but knowing that it is appointed once for man to die and being desirous to dispose of the worldy goods wherewith it has pleased God to bless me do make and ordain this to be my last will in manner following–To wit–after the payment of my Just debts I will & bequeath unto my beloved wife Rebecca Bramlett all my estate both real and personal let it consist of whatsoever it may during her natural life or widowhood in case my wife shall marry I desire my estate divid[ed] between my wife & children that is to say I give to my wife one third part of my whole estate both real & personal to her & her heirs forever & the other two thirds I wish equally divided between my five children–Elbert Bramlett, John Bramlett, Nancy Bramlett, Charles Bramlett & William Bramlett all share & share alike to them & their heirs forever. I also desire that if my wife shall give birth to any other child or children by me I desire that such child or children shall share equally in my estate with my five children above named.

L. Westmoreland, James W. Green, Martha V. Westmoreland. W. H. Bramlett.\n\nThe witnesses and Rebecca (Roe) Bramlett appeared in court to prove the will on Nov. 16, 1863 (Apt. 22, File 26). Rebecca made a request to finalize a settlement of the estate on Feb. 2, 1870. The inventory of William’s estate, signed by his brothers-in-law Ignatius Few and Benjamin Few, indicates William had property valued at $1,833 and $67.74 in cash with $1,600.84 worth of “notes” at the time of his death. The county court was involved in settling the estate for about eight years after William died. Rebecca did not have any other children after William died: the five children named in his will–Elbert, John, Nancy, Charles and William–also are named as his heirs in Rebecca’s final report. The court set a date for a final hearing on the estate on March 3, 1870. At that time, the court appointed P. B. Benson guardian of the children.\n\nWilliam H. and Rebecca are mentioned in Lou Alice F. Turner’s 1981 book Jackson Grove Methodist Church History as members of the church in 1835 (72).\n\nWilliam is enumerated in his parents’ house in the 1830-1840 U.S. Census records for Greenville County. “William Bramblett,” 25, born in South Carolina, is listed there in the 1850 U.S. Census with his parents, William, 64, born South Carolina, and Nancy, 62, born in Virginia, and siblings (NARA Film M432:853:367B).

Rebecca claimed William’s personal effects and $55.50 in back pay on that day.\n\nRebecca took courage and cared for her children, no doubt struggling to keep the farm and feed the family on her own in an economically and spiritually struggling war-torn region for the next 44 years.

He raised a company, Capt. J. W. Bramlett’s Company, later Company D, Eighteenth Regiment, South Carolina Infantry, and enlisted himself on Dec. 4, 1861, for 12 months at Mountain Spring, Anderson Co., S.C. One roster states the regiment, attached to Evans’ Brigade, was organized for state service Jan. 2, 1862, and mustered into Confederate service Jan. 5, 1862. The regiment was organized for 12 months but re-organized May 5, 1862, under the conscript act for three years of service from enlistment.

He requested a 15-day leave of absence on Nov. 1, 1863, to take care of “business of great importance that requires my presence at home” in Anderson, S.C. His request indicates he had not been home in eight months. He returned and tendered his resignation Nov. 26, 1863, from Camp at Christ Church Parish, S.C., and was discharged Dec. 8, 1863. After the war John was a member of Camp Manning Austin of Confederate Veterans, which was organized Nov. 18, 1893, in Greenville County.\n\n“John Bramlett,” 40, farmer, $300 real estate, $200 personal estate, and (first) wife, Sarah, 40, are listed in the 1870 U.S. Census for Mush Creek P.O., Highland Twp., Greenville Co., S.C., with six children: Wm.

[John Wilson] Bramlett, a leading physician of Campobello, and the bride, Miss Wilkes, a well known and popular young lady of Chester. The bridal party arrived here Sunday morning and stopped at the Spartan Inn. At once a flurry was created in the hotel and everybody was asking, “Who’s going to be married?” The party was accompanied by Dr. W. J. Bramlett and Geo. H. [W.?] Bramlett of Greenville, relatives of the groom. At 12 o’clock, the party went to the residence of Bishop W. W.

Eva died Oct. 22, 1952, in Chester. Her obituary, which appears in the Oct. 23, 1952, edition of The State in Columbia, is headlined “Mrs. Bramlett, Chester Civic Leader, Dies”:\n\nMrs. Eva Wilkes Bramlett, 74, widow of Dr. John Wilson Bramlett of the Baton Rouge community of western Chester county, died at 12:30 this morning at the Chester County Hospital [Pryor Hospital] of heart trouble. She was a former postmistress of Leeds for 20 years and a widely known former public school teacher. She was an outstanding civic leader of Chester county and a charter member of the Chester County Council of Farm Women. As a member of that council, along with another member, Mrs. J. C. Shannon of Blackstock, she was instrumental in the organization of the Chester County home demonstration department which has been such a great asset to the county since that day. She was graduated from the Chester county schools and from Asheville (N.C.) College and Columbia College. Following graduation she taught school for approximately 20 years at Conway, Baton Rouge and Campobello. She married Doctor Bramlett, prominent physician of Campobello who died in 1906 [1907]. Mrs. Bramlett was a member of New Hope Methodist Church where she took a great interest in all departments. She was president of its missionary society for a quarter of a century. Then she was made honorary president. Mrs. Bramlett was a daughter of the late Capt. John Wesley [Wilkes], an officer of the Confederate army, and the late Mrs. Eliza Walker Wilkes. After having retired as postmistress at Leeds following 20 years service, she had made her home for the past two years with her son, John Wesley Bramlett at Baton Rouge. Mrs. Bramlett is survived by her son, John Wesley Bramlett of Baton Rouge; a daughter, Mrs. Thomas [Sarah] Lake of Silverstreet; seven grandchildren, one great-grandchild; two brothers, B. Frank Wilkes of Chester and Robert W. Wilkes of Baton Rouge, and two sisters, Mrs. W. M. Harley [Blanche] of Jamison, Orangeburg County, and Miss Nelle Wilkes of Baton Rouge. Funeral services will be conducted at 3 o’clock Thursday afternoon from Calvary Baptist Church, Chester county, by the Rev. Francis V. Robertson of Armenia, the Rev. E. W. Buckner of Chester and the Rev. S. B. White of Union. Interment will follow in the family plot in the historic church cemetery.\n\nEva was “the eldest and favorite child of her father, Captain John Wesley Wilkes (also known as Judge Wilkes since he was a longtime local magistrate), and his wife, Eliza Walker Harden,” according to Ellen Bramlett Clarke. Eva “attended Columbia Female College in Columbia, S.C., for two years and received teacher training at Asheville Normal School, Asheville, N.C. She was awarded a First Grade Teacher’s Certificate the highest level. At age 18, she was teaching grades one through eight in a one-room school in the Baton Rouge Section of Chester Co., S.C. She taught at Campobello Graded School during the spring term of 1901 and in Conway in 1901-1902 at the Burroughs Graded School. In the fall of 1902, Eva returned to teach at Campobello. She met Dr. John Wilson Bramlett, a local druggist and physician, and they were married in January 1903.” When her husband died from complications of pneumonia, Eva “was left with the burdens of two very young children to rear and heavy debts left by her husband, a hard-working doctor who had not pressed patients to pay,” Ellen Bramlett Clarke explains. “A note circa March 1908 penned on a copy of the statement of one former patient’s account reveals the widow’s desperate financial straits: ‘I do need this money so much. I would be more than thankful if you will kindly hand it to Mr. Walter Jackson [at the bank] for me. I have two little helpless babies to raise, surely you can arrange to pay me this amount [25.00]. Mrs. J. W. Bramlett.’” Dr. Bramlett’s ledger book for 1901-1903 lists payments in both cash and goods, including one dog $4.00; one turkey $1.00; one gallon of syrup $0.40; fodder $10.00; two pigs $5.00; one bushel of potatoes $0.60; three hens $0.75; 10 bushels of corn $8.50; one ham $2.50; and firewood $5.00. Ellen Bramblett Clarke indicates that “Of the almost 300 patient accounts in this ledger, less than half had paid their bills when Dr. Bramlett died in 1907 and indeed, never paid them.” Eva was forced to sell the drug store and their house and land in Campobello. Subsequently, “After two years of trying to settle her husband’s business affairs, Eva found it necessary to move back to her family’s home in Chester County. In Baton Rouge Township again, in the fall of 1909, Eva returned to teaching and her parents took care of the children. She taught school for the next 20 years and in 1933, became postmistress of the post office at Leeds, S.C. Eva was widely known in Chester county for her work in church and community affairs and for her extensive knowledge of family history.” “Eva W.

Not that Father Bramlett had not a comfortable and abundant home of his own, where he resided with a most affectionate daughter, but that affection prompted to do all that might be done—by varying the scene around him—to prolong his life. He was 93 years old, Oct. 30, one month before his death. He enjoyed the greatest Christian serenity I have have ever known one to possess. For years before his death, meet him where you would, in reply to the usual salutation, “How do you do?” he would answer “Feeble in body, but as happy as a man can be.” He united with the church after he attained to manhood and was married [in 1814]. He was ever much devoted to Sabbath-schools, and gave, as a teacher, constant attention until 1880, when he became so deaf he could no longer teach a class. He then sat as a scholar in a class until within a few weeks of his death. His wife preceded him to the grave about 11 years ago, full of faith and hope. His residence was near Bethel Church, Greenville Ct. He was a son of sainted Father John Bramlett, of precious memory to Bethel Church. A very large concourse attended the burial at Bethel.” (Vol. 48, No. 12, p. 7, col. 2)\n\nReuben’s tombstone indicates “He joined M. E.

Church 1821.” She died in Greenville County. Sarah’s obituary was published in the Southern Christian Advocate in 1873:\n\n“…Died, on the 8th of June, 1873, Mrs. Sarah D. Bramlett, wife of Rev. Reuben Bramlett, in the 77th year of her age. The deceased was a native of Virginia, and came with her parents to South Carolina in her childhood, and settled and married in Greenville County; where she has lived for over 70 years, and raised a large family—having at her death some 68 grandchildren, 11 children—9 sons and 2 daughters—and the majority of them have large families living in this county. At one time during the late war, 20 of her sons and grandsons were in the army, fighting for the principles they believed to be right. The Indians had scarcely left their hunting grounds in our county, and the echo of their war songs had barely ceased, when she adopted it as her home. The people of her generation have nearly all passed away. Her husband, Rev. Reuben Bramlett, still survives her, at the advanced age of 83 years, having lived together for over a half century in the enjoyment of a domestic felicity and contentment that few of the present or past generation have ever experienced. Mrs. Bramlett was a consistent member of the Methodist Episcopal Church for over 50 years, and her influence was like that of a true mother’s love—like the silent dews of heaven, it was ever cheering and refreshing around the family circle, and will transmit its religious power to her latest posterity; for one of the grand aims of her life was to teach her household in the faith that “There is a land of pure delight, / Where saints immortal reign; / Infinite day excludes the night, / And pleasures banish pain.” For months before her death, she daily and hourly expected the dread summons, and although suffering the most excruciating agony from Cancer, she was resigned to her fate, and could say, with the patriarch Job, “All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.” And thus has she left to her numerous friends and relatives a consolation that is sweeter than life and stronger than death; for above the bloom of the grave will arise the light of a pure and honest life.”\n\n“Mauldin SC Sept 28 / 09 Dear Nephew, Your note received and also the record.

I have not seen them since they were children but hear they are married and living in Mitchell County, Ga., near Camilla; and my father, Josiah Daniel Wooten [born 1826, died 1886].\n\n“Father was raised on the plantation in Decatur County, Ga. until he was grown, attending only such poor schools as they had at Bainbridge, the county seat. When of age, Grandfather Wooten set him up in Business as a merchant in Bainbridge. He was such when Mother, about 18 years of age, was on a visit in Bainbridge in 1858, when they met, fell in love and were married in August 1863 at the Methodist Church in that place. Mother died January 1877, leaving six children: George F., married to Katie King in 1879, living at Bainbridge, Ga., now has four children, Florence, Victor, Garfield, Mildred, and one boy whose name I have not learned (Roscoe); Martha Ermina (Minnie) married to Daniel W. Mitchell September, 1883, now living in Bainbridge, has one boy Julien McRae [Mitchell], named after yours truly; Julien Potter, nothing and unmarried, living nowhere; Josiah D., Jr., Ditto; Hattie Cornelia, now at Andrew Female Academy with Aunt Sue in Cuthbert, Ga.; Sweet little Ida Bettie, still a child.\n\n“Information from my great aunt Charlotte Nicholson, nee Johnson, informs me that Great Grandfather Levi Wooten and his wife, Memima, nee Breeland, were born and reared on Beach Branch near Lawtonville, not far from the railroad station now of Allendale or Brunson on the Port Royal Augusta Railway; grandmother Elizabeth Wooten, nee Johnson (“Betsey”) from same place. Shade and Joe were brothers of Grandfather Wooten – also William.\n\n“The old Wooten plantation is now (1886) owned by Dr. Wm. Breeland and is two miles from Beach Branch Church, the family graves are there. Dr. Breeland is a relative of ours on the side of my paternal great-grandmother.\n\n“Grandmother Wooten died in November 1847, aged about 50 years and her grave is on the old Smart Place in Georgia opposite Haywood’s Landing on the Chattahoochee River.\n\nSheet # 4\n\n“C. Beattie Johnson, an insurance agent in Shreveport, La., is a second cousin of mine; his father Ben (?) Johnson was a brother of my grandmother Wooten.\n\nAunt Matt Allday, sister to my mother, is a widow, now living at Round Mountain, Blanco County, Texas.\n\nAunt Mary White is now living at Leon, Kansas.\n\nAunt Rosa Hunt, Dardenelle, Arkansas.\n\nMrs. Gould, Uncle Elias’ daughter…Jersey City….\n\nRobert P. Franks, Cheraw, S.C.\n\nDr. Bramlet, Easley, S.C.\n\nBeverly Potter, Spartanburg, S.C.\n\nMiss Lilla Collins, Beaufort, S.C.\n\nUncle Jones Wooten, Lawtonville, S.C.\n\n*In checking up this item, learned from the Librarian of Public Library in Denver, who is an Indianian and has made a study of Indiana history, that he found no Bramlette who has been governor of Indiana but one Bramlette who had been governor of Kentucky. This perhaps is due to some inaccuracy of memory. [HWD]\n\nMary Eliza Bramlett, child of John Wesley and Malinda Isha Bramlett, was born Jan. 30, 1853.
