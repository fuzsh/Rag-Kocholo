The project was based on, featuring works of and was inspired by William S Burroughs. A DVD, \"The Final Academy Documents\" is a DVD of edited highlights from the tour, including Burroughs's public appearance in 1982 and reading from his work at Manchester's Haçienda club, a performance by John Giorno and includes the experimental film collaborations with Anthony Balch, Brion Gysin, and others - \"Towers Open Fire\" and \"Ghosts at No. 9\". [http://www.ubu.com/sound/burroughs.html] [http://www.ubu.com/film/burroughs.html] [http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/index.html]\n\nMany of Burroughs's works were later republished with revisions made by the author, and/or censored material restored. Both \"Junkie\"/\"Junky\" and \"Naked Lunch\" were published in \"restored\" editions following Burroughs's death. An expanded edition of \"Yage Letters\" entitled \"Yage Letters Redux\" was published in April 2006.\n\nBurroughs also played a cameo part in the motion picture \"Drugstore Cowboy\". He also collaborated on the documentary \"\" eventually released in 2007.\n\nRecordings (partial list)"
