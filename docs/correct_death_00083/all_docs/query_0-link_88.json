A. Evans who is connected with the U. S. Agricultural Bureau, which, if published in your paper, may be of advantage to the planters of Rapides, that is, if they have boll weevil there, which I trust is not the case.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nG. M. Ratcliffe\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture\n\nBureau of Plant Industry\n\nWashington, D. C.\n\nFarmers' Cooperative Cotton Demonstration Work\n\nLake Charles, La., May 13, 1907\n\nMr. G. M. Ratcliffe\n\nAllen, La.\n\nDear Sir: - We have just received a letter from our Special Agent, Mr. E. J. Gigleux, who writes that you are having the weevil picked from the cotton on your plantation and have so far captured 13,000 weevils, for which you are paying at the rate of one cent each, and asks us to write you and him what we think of this method. There can be no question that the plan of picking the weevil from young cotton is entirely feasible and will pay if the labor can be secured cheap enough. As the weevil get more numerous on the cotton you should be able to secure children to do this work for considerable less money. In the spring of 1904, I had under my observation a farm in the Brazos river bottom of Texas where this plan was carried out thoroughly. The planter secured all the negro children in his neighborhood and kept them in his fields day after day, paying them at the rate of fifteen cents per hundred for all weevils caught. They took it systematically and went over the field row by row just as they would in cultivating. He did this three times securing on 75 acres a total of nearly 60,000 weevil. After the cotton began to square it of course became difficult to find the weevil, and he then employed the same chidren paying them seventy-five cents per day to go through the field and pick up all the punctured squares and to pick off the cotton stalks all squares that had been punctured. He continued this until the cotton was nearly waist high, and in that time they picked up and burned over 75 bushels of the punctured squares. The total cost of all this work did not greatly exceed $2 per acre. He made an average of three-fourths of a bale of cotton per acre, and this, too, in spite of the fact that there was a long wet spell the latter part of June and the first of July that caused the cotton to grow rank and prevented cultivation at this critical time. It was his opinion, and mine also, that but for this unfavorable spell of weather at the critical time he would have made from 1 1-4 to 1 1-2 bales per acre. His neighbors who did not take these precautions and did not follow the cultural methods in the cultivation of their crop only made one bale to five or six acres. I doubt if you can continue to pay one cent each for the weevils as they become more numerous, but if you can scale down the price paid so as to get the work done at a reasonable cost, there is nothing you can do that will be of more benefit than this. I would much rather risk picking the weevil from young cotton than attempt killing them by poison. Of course, if you are unable to secure labor to continue this work at a reasonable expense, and the weevil should get very numerous on the young cotton before it begins to square, you would be justified in trying Paris green. There is no question in the world but that Paris green will kill weevil on the young cotton, but there is a great deal of question as to whether it can be applied on a large scale in such a manner that it will do the work effectively, at a cost that will justify it. The question of cost is one each planter must decide for himself.\n\nWe are,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. A. Evans, Gen. Asst.\n\n2744. Dick Geiger <dickgeiger -at- aol.com>, \"Descendants of George Ann McAfee & Charles Theodore Ratcliffe,\" 23 Jan 2009.\n\nArticle taken from the Alexandria Weekly Town Talk of 06 July 1889:\n\n\"DIFFICULTY AND HOMICIDE\n\nIt has been nearly five years since the TOWN TALK was called upon to chronicle a homicide within the corporate limits of Alexandria.\n\nOn last Monday afternoon, the 1st inst., at about 2:20 o'clock, the report of a gun was heard from the direction of Fourth street. It was heard by a number of people, many of whom thought that the City Marshall had shot a dog. Soon a crowd had collected at the scene of the shooting, on Fourth street, in the rear of Mrs. Ratcliffe's residence, and M. W. Cockerille was found lying on the ground, suffering from a gun shot wound in the small of his back, near the termination of the spine.\n\nIt was soon generally known that Henry Ratcliffe had done the shooting, the weapon used being a shotgun loaded with buck-shot, and his brother George Ratcliffe was accused of being a party to the killing.\n\nMontfort Cockerille was taken to his home on lower 4th street on a cot, and after about 1 1/2 hours of intense suffering, passed away. Three physicians were in attendance, but the wound was necessarily fatal, and their skill was of no avail.\n\nHenry Ratcliffe surrendered immediately to the Sheriff, and as soon as an affidavit was made against George Ratcliffe, he also surrendered.\n\nJudge Blackman being related to the deceased young man by marriage he recused himself, and Judge Coco was summoned from Marksville to hold the preliminary examination.\n\nThe preliminary trial commenced about 3 o'clock p.m. on Wednesday and continued till 8 1/2 o'clock that night. It was resumed on Thursday morning, the 4th, by consent of the State and defense, and was concluded about 10 o'clock a.m. Judge Coco allowed the accused bond in the sum of $2500 each, which they readily furnished.\n\nAbout 40 witnesses were summoned. The principle witnesses for the State were Dr. John Casson, coroner; W. J. Calvit, S. L. Cockerille, Miss Eliza Holt, Oliver Bassett, Francis Carr and Mrs. Richardson.\n\nThe principle witnesses examined for the defense were Mrs. E. B. Price, Miss Jennie Ratcliffe and Joseph Smith.\n\nKnowing that all our readers are interested in this sad affair, we give below some of the evidence of important witnesses at the preliminary trial:\n\nS. L. Cockerille testified that as he and his brother Montfort were passing along Fourth street, in the rear of the residence of Mrs. Ratcliffe, that George Ratcliffe opened [several words illegible here] toward him, and said: \"I received your letter.\" Cockerille then says he made a reply, whereupon George Ratcliffe struck him on the head with a walking cane, simultaneously Henry Ratcliffe fired the gun which killed his brother. That his brother did not have even a stick in his hand, and that both of them were in their shirt sleeves. That Henry Ratcliffe was just within his mother's back gate, when the gun fired. That George Ratcliffe ran him (Lee Cockerille) some distance striking him with a stick, and that after George Ratcliffe had ceased striking him that he returned to where his brother was lying on the ground, and that he did not touch him. He believes the only person he saw when he returned to his brother was Henry Ratcliffe. That the reason he, S. L. Cockerille, ran was because he thought Henry Ratcliffe was going to shoot him with the other barrel of the gun.\n\nIn the evidence the following was brought out: It seemed that a few days previous to the homicide S. L. Cockerille sent a colored boy to Geo. Ratcliffe, and that the boy returned to Cockerille with a verbal message from George Ratcliffe. S. L. Cockerille when he received that verbal message wrote a letter and sent it to George Ratcliffe. Cockerille admitted in his evidence that he had said in his letter that, if he, George Ratcliffe, had made certain assertions that the colored boy said he had, that he, George Ratcliffe, \"was a willful, malicious liar and the truth was not in him: I (Cockerille) throw down the gauntlet and if you choose you can pick it up.\"\n\nOne of the principle witnesses for the defense was a man named Joseph Smith, who lives on the Heyman place. He says he saw the entire difficulty. He admitted having gone out of town hurriedly to keep from being a witness. That he had only told one person, confidentally, he had seen the killing. His testimony reduced was that he had seen Montfort Cockerille change a stick from his right hand to his left hand and then put his hand behind him as if to pull a weapon. Just at that moment, and before the gun was fired, he heard some one say: \"Don't shoot my brother.\"\n\nIt was brought out in the testimony of Wm. Hill that George Ratcliffe had recently bought a new shot-gun, that he had told him (Hill) and other friends that he intended to try it with buckshot to see if it acted well. Also by other witnesses that Henry Ratcliffe and A. L. Miller were to leave for White Sulphur Springs on Monday evening, and that Henry Ratcliffe was to borrow the shot-gun, and at the time the difficulty took place George and Henry Ratcliffe were on their way to the back of town to try the gun with buckshot before Henry left for the Springs, the hour for leaving being about 8 o'clock, p.m.\n\nThe dying statements of Montfort Cockerille to his mother and Mrs. Nettie Calvit were to the effect that he had been shot for nothing, that he had done nothing nor said nothing [sic] to be killed for.\n\nMr. E. G. Hunter is counsel for the accused; and District Attorney Andrews looked after the State.\n\nMontfort and S. L. Cockerille are the sons of the late Dr. A. Cockerille. Montfort at the time of his death was about 30 years old and was keeping a grocery store on upper Third street. His brother kieeps a saloon on the same street.\n\nGeorge and Henry Ratcliffe keep a grocery on Second street. They are the sons of the late Dr. Ratcliffe who practiced medicine in this parish for several years, but came here with his family about eight years ago from Hopkinsville, Ky.\"\n\n2745.
