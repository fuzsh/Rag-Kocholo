INTRODUCTION\n\nWith the rapid increase in the U.S. elderly (65+) and oldest-old (85+) populations, considerable concern has emerged over the amount of future acute and long-term care (LTC) services that will be required by that population, and of the nature of the mixture of federal, state and private programs necessary to respond to that need. One of the areas of service needs with the projected greatest rate of growth is that for LTC services. The National Nursing Home Surveys (NNHS) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics in 1963, 1969, 1973, 1977 and, most recently, 1985 (with a follow-up in 1987) have provided considerable information on the institutional component of LTC services. More recently, because of the rapid growth of the elderly and oldest-old populations, considerable interest has emerged in home LTC options, both because of concern about the economics of institutional care and because of humanitarian concern about the level of dependency and quality of life in many LTC institutions. Until the advent of the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) there was no major nationally representative survey with specially designed instrumentation that dealt explicitly both with the health and functional problems of the community dwelling disabled elderly, the home LTC options (both formal and informal) available to meet those problems, and the ability to substitute, for a specific target population, home and institutional care. The 1982 NLTCS filled this gap in our knowledge and provided considerable information on which both to plan the nature of required services and to develop private insurance products to pay for such services. The 1984 NLTCS provided a basis upon which to examine changes in the home LTC populations and to examine the trajectory of service needs at the individual level.\n\nThe 1982 and 1984 NLTCS are detailed household surveys of persons aged 65 and over who manifest some chronic (i.e., 90 days +) Activity of Daily Living (ADL) or Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) impairment. The sample for the surveys was drawn using a two-stage procedure. In 1982, 36,000 names were drawn from the Health Insurance Master file. These persons were then screened by either telephone or personal visit to see if they manifested an ADL or IADL impairment of 90 days duration (or which was anticipated to last at least 90 days). When the screen identified a person living in the community with a chronic impairment, a detailed household interview was conducted which gathered information on medical status (diag- noses), functional status (presence of ADL, IADL or other functional impairments and equipment or caregivers utilized by the person to deal with his impairments), income and assets, health service use, use of federal services, housing and living arrangements. Of particular note in the survey were detailed questions on the number and type of informal caregivers. Institutionalized persons were not interviewed in 1982.\n\nIn 1984, a different sampling procedure was utilized. First, all persons who reported chronic disability on the screener or who were screener-noninterviewed due to institutionalization and who survived to 1984 were interviewed regardless of their 1984 functional status. Second, from the original 25,541 persons who did not report functional impairments in 1982 (and who were not institutionalized), a random sample of 47% (~12,100 persons) was drawn and subjected to the same screening procedure as in 1982. Another difference from 1982 was that 5,000 persons who became 65 between 1982 and 1984 were screened so that, in addition to having a longitudinally followed sample in 1984, the full cross-section of persons aged 65 and over in 1984 could be evaluated. In addition, persons who were in institutions in 1984 were interviewed with a specially designed instrument containing a number of questions on institutional use in the interim period and the sources of payment for those services. The interview instrument used for the community population was nearly identical in 1984 to that used in 1982. A final major difference between the 1982 and 1984 surveys was that a \"next of kin\" interview was conducted for persons who died between 1982 and 1984. This interview collected extensive data on the medical service use and expenditures surrounding death.\n\nThese surveys conducted in 1982 and 1984 cannot be fully exploited without considering their linkage to another important data source--Medicare Part A bill files from 1980 to 1985 on Medicare reimbursed hospitalization, home health services and skilled nursing facility use. These files contain bills for individual service episodes and provide a continuous history of the exact date of service use and the amounts reimbursed by Medicare for those services. Each bill in this interval is linked to the corresponding sample person who participated in either the 1982 or 1984 survey.\n\nThe dual cross-sectional and longitudinal nature of the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS and the linked Medicare service use files allow us to analyze a broad range of questions. First, they provide an impressive array of data on the community dwelling chronically disabled elderly, a population group at high risk of both extensive acute and LTC service needs. These data can help us estimate the need for LTC services, the actuarial basis of, and markets for, LTC insurance products, the role of \"spend-down\" for Medicaid qualification for LTC benefits, and the impact of informal caregivers on meeting the national need for LTC services.\n\nIn addition to describing the social, economic, functional and health status characteristics of a large (~5 million persons) population group at high risk for significant Medicaid and Medicare services (and for the development of private insurance options to provide parts of those services), the data files provide considerable information on the pattern of utilization and outcome of Medicare Part A (and potentially Medicare Part B) services. That is, the continuous time Medicare service history of individuals whose detailed health and functional characteristics have been determined from the surveys is available. This linkage can allow questions to be examined such as the substitution of home health and skilled nursing facility (SNF) services for acute hospitalization after the introduction of the prospective payment system (PPS) in order to assess how the reduction of the rate of hospitalization and the shortening of hospital LOS affected the nature of the use of these other service options. This can be used to evaluate the impact of such Medicare changes and to design changes, as necessary, in the provision of hospital, home health and SNF services by Medicare.\n\nA third major area where these data can be important is in the study of changes, both for the individual and for the aggregate, in terms of health and functional status. Because of limitations on the availability of longitudinal data, the design of service and insurance options has been constrained. The availability of large amounts of nationally representative data on long term (two-year changes) in health, functional, economic, and social status is an important and unique feature of this data set.\n\nA fourth major use of this data set is to help provide national estimates of LTC service needs by combining national distributions of functional limitations from the survey with very detailed data from select populations in a wide variety of LTC demonstration projects and waivered programs. That is, detailed data on Medicaid and private payment for LTC services are available in the demonstration projects along with data on the effects of those services (and modifications of those services) on a wide variety of social and health outcomes. The problem is to extrapolate those findings from the multiple, local select populations in the demonstrations to the national population. Because the instrumentation of the NLTCS has many measures in common with many of the demonstration projects, there is a lot of information on which to base the extrapolation.\n\nIn this introduction we have very briefly reviewed the rationale, structure, content and some potential areas of application of the 1982-1984 NLTCS and linked Medicare files. In subsequent sections we will explore specific technical issues concerning the quality of the survey data and its analysis in more detail.\n\nII. TEMPORAL ORGANIZATION OF THE 1982-1984 NLTCS\n\nWe briefly described in the introduction how the samples were constructed for the cross-sectional and longitudinal components of the 1982-1984 NLTCS. A more systematic review of this can be made from Figure 1.\n\nFIGURE 1: unavailable at the time of HTML conversion--will be added at a later date.\n\nIn Figure 1 we present a time line for the 1982-1984 (and a proposed 1988) NLTCS which identifies the dates of the surveys, the dates for which Medicare Part A data are to be collected and the survey instruments applied at each date. The 1988 survey is currently in a tentative planning phase. All other elements of the survey and service use data collection are in-place except for the proposed collection of death certificates for decedents over the period 1982 to 1989.\n\nWe can see that the sample was originally \"frozen\" as of April 1, 1982 and contained 35,789 persons. Survey work for round 1 began in June and continued to October 1982 and produced 6,088 responses from the 6,393 persons identified as chronically disabled. In addition to the survey of disabled persons a separate survey of 1,925 caregivers (1,626 continuing caregivers and 299 caregivers who discontinued care) who were identified as having provided care to a subsample of the 6,393 persons who screened into the survey. In addition to the 6,393 community dwelling elderly disabled, 1,992 persons were found to be in institutions, either before April 1 (N=1708) or who became institutionalized between April 1 and the screening date (N=284). Thus, though no interviews in 1982 were conducted of institutionalized persons, and we cannot identify Medicaid and private pay institutionalized persons from the Medicare files, we can identify the total set (N=1992) of institutionalized persons from the screen.\n\nOn April 1, 1984, the sample components of the 1984 survey were fixed and field work again conducted between June and October 1984. At this time three survey instruments were applied to nearly 10,000 persons. One instrument was essentially the same questionnaire as was applied to the 1982 community dwelling, disabled elderly population. A second instrument was the institutional questionnaire which allowed us to examine the retrospective reports of the institutional histories of all persons institutionalized on April 1. These reports covered all facets of institutionalization (Medicaid and private pay as well as Medicare). The third type of survey was the \"next of kin\" questionnaire on health services received during the terminal phase of the illness for deceased persons who were reported as disabled in 1982 and who died in the two-year intervening period. Medicare Part A data cover all service use from January 1, 1980, to currently October 1986.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the size of the sample components and their change in sample status between 1982 and 1984, examine Figure 2.\n\nFIGURE 2. Component Sub-Populations of 1982 and 1984 NLTC Surveys: unavailable at the time of HTML conversion--will be added at a later date.\n\nWe see several different types of numbers in the figure. First, above each block is a single number which represents the number of persons in that state at that time. Thus, there were 25,541 persons (of 31,934 who were not institutionalized and who responded to at least the telephone screen) who were determined to be non-disabled, community dwellers in 1982. In 1984 there were 14,130 such persons--a number much smaller than the 25,541 because only 47.4% of the 1982 non-disabled group was screened.\n\nUnder each block is a set of four numbers. For 1982 these describe the number of persons in that state who ended up in one of the four receiving states in 1984. Thus, 9,220 persons who were non-disabled, aged 65+ and sampled (of the 47.4% of people who were non-disabled in 1982) turned out to be non-disabled in 1984. Of this group, 1,562 became disabled and were interviewed in 1984, 348 persons became institutionalized in 1984, and 970 died.\n\nThe corresponding numbers for 1984 tell us where persons in those states come from. Thus, of the 6,182 persons receiving the detailed survey in 1984, 1,562 were not detailed in 1982, 4,114 were people who were disabled in 1982 (but who were not necessarily disabled in 1984--thus long term improvements in health and functional status can be tracked over the two-year period), 53 persons were interviewed in 1984 in the community who were institutionalized in 1982, and 453 persons became disabled and were interviewed from the sample of 4,916 persons drawn from those aged 63 or 64 in 1982. The deceased block shows that a total of 3,219 persons died from the four sample components over the two years.\n\nOne issue that arises in evaluating the 1982-1984 NLTCS is that, in order to increase its precision, a two-stage sample capture procedure was used to identify community dwelling disabled persons. Thus, it does not provide detailed survey data on various groups. For example, though it divides the total sample in 1982 into the set of all community disabled persons, the set of all institutionalized persons, and the set of all non-disabled, non- institutionalized persons, it provides no detailed data on non-institutional, non-disabled persons. The characteristics of such persons are described in the recent 1984-1986 Supplement on Aging (SOA)-Longitudinal Supplement on Aging (LSOA) of the National Health Interview Survey. The SOA-LSOA provides far less information on the disabled extremely elderly (only 876 persons over age 85 were identified in 1984) and both smaller numbers (~1,500) and less detailed information on the functionally impaired and the formal and informal care services they receive. Thus, each of these surveys complement one another but provide very different samplings of target populations and very different (and specially tailored) instruments. Likewise, the 1985 NNHS is being followed-up in 1987. That survey gives us much larger numbers and more specialized information than the NLTCS. However, it does not contain a true admission cohort. Thus, the three surveys may be reviewed as complementary in terms of sample coverage and instrumentation. This is illustrated in the coordinated time lines of the three surveys presented in Figure 3.\n\nFIGURE 3. TIME LINES FOR THREE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS: unavailable at the time of HTML conversion--will be added at a later date.\n\nThe three sets of longitudinal surveys provide a powerful, and cost effective base battery of surveys to monitor the health and functional status of the elderly population and its consumption of acute and LTC services.\n\nIII. RESPONSE RATES AND PATTERNS OF PROXY RESPONSES\n\nTwo useful measures of the quality of data in surveys are the rate of non-response and the patterns of response of proxies. This is especially true for the NLTCS because (a) it had large numbers of extreme elderly persons for whom obtaining survey responses is known to be difficult, and (b) the survey had a longitudinal dimension meaning persons have to be tracked over time.\n\nTo evaluate these issues we provide two basic types of data. The first are the non-response rates for various sample stages in both 1982 and 1984. There are two types of non-responses to be considered. The first type are the so-called \"C\" type \"non\"-responses. Actually, this is a slight misnomer in that these people did not respond because they did not qualify for the sample. The major reasons for not qualifying were (a) death, (b) institutionalization (in 1982 only), and (c) movement out of the sample area. Thus, this type of failure to respond does not represent what we typically view as non-response. The type C non-responses are described in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1. Number of Ineligible Cases (Type C) by Reason and Survey Instrument Attempled, 1982 and 1984 NLTCS's - '82 Screener Telephone '82 Screener Personal Visit '82 Detailed Community '84 Screener Telephone '84 Screener Personal Visit '84 Detailed Community '84 Institutional Questionnaire Deceased before April 1 390 340 - 537 30 - - Deceased on or after April 1 280 210 67 101 16 - - Institutionalized before April 1 1151 557 0 0 - - - Institutionalized on or after April 1 123 161 57 - - - - Moved outside country before April 1 13 21 - 13 5 - - Moved outside country on or after April 1 5 6 1 - 1 1 1 Moved within country, beyond limit - 81 25 16 32 19 7 Other Type C 72 15 14 47 6 1 - In correctional facility (84 only) - - - 1 - - -\n\nThe second type of non-response was labelled \"A\" type non-response. These represent non- responses due to either failure to locate or contact persons, refusals, or failures of the proxy to be able to respond. The frequency of non-responses is described in Table 2.\n\nTABLE 2. Number of Nonrespondents (Type A) by Noninterview Reason and Survey Instrument Attempted, 1982 and 1984 NLTCS's - '82 Screener Personal Visit '82 Detailed Community '84 Screener Personal Visit '84 Detailed Community '84 Institutional Questionnaire '84 Deceased Questionnaire Telephone '84 Deceased Questionnaire Personal Visit No telephone number 250 - - - - 30 - No answer after repeated calls 7 - - - - 4 - Sample person/proxy temparily absent and proxy unavailable 15 5 21 4 3 1 2 Refused 89 111 92 131 13 12 8 Sample person/proxy unable to respond and proxy unavailable 4 3 2 19 - 7 3 Other Type A 89 15 126 57 16 10 54 Unable to locate - 1 127 5 2 - 27 No one home - - 5 7 1 - 1 NOTE: The '82 and '84 Screeners as well as the '84 deceased questionnaire provided for both telephone and personal visit noninterview reasons. In nonrespondent cases where a reason is given in both categories, the personal visit reason was selected for tabulation.\n\nWe can see that the frequency of non-response was very low producing response rates that are extremely high, both for the screening and detailed interview stages, in both 1982 and 1984. The response rates average about 96%. Thus, neither the longitudinal nature of the survey nor the high proportion of the extreme elderly seems to have caused problems in the level of response to the survey.\n\nThe second aspect of the response question is the pattern of proxy respondents. This is indicated in Table 3 where, for both 1982 and 1984, and for different levels of disability, we provide the number of responses (a) totally by sample persons, (b) totally by proxy, and (c) for combined sample person and proxy respondents.\n\nTABLE 3.

Furthermore, we see that about 500 persons in 1982 and 1984 had a proxy respondent due to senility. Indeed, the diagnosis of senility was derived from the proxy when the person was found incapable of responding due to cognitive impairment. Of the roughly 6,000 interviews in both years, about two-thirds were totally from sample persons. The pattern of proxy response (i.e., its increase with disability), the small number of non-responses due to proxy failure (Table 2), and the large proportion of non-proxy responses provide an indication of the appropriateness of the use of proxy responses in the survey.\n\nIV. SAMPLE DESIGN AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE SURVEY\n\nAn important factor in the analysis of any survey, but one that frequently generates confusion, is the appropriate use of sample weights in the analysis. This is because sample weights play different roles in different stages of the analysis and because there are several different methodologies for dealing with the effects of sample design in analysis. The issues become more complex in the current study because of its longitudinal nature.\n\nThe first set of issues involves the role of weights in various stages of analysis. One stage of analysis has to do with the testing of statistical hypotheses using the survey data. The basic problem is that the samples are not simple random samples but are probability samples, i.e., different populations are drawn with a pre-specified probability to increase the precision of estimates for certain rare populations. Furthermore, in some sample designs, the samples are drawn from spatially designated clusters to reduce costs. Since persons in each cluster will tend to share certain social-economic and residential characteristics this means that their responses will tend to be correlated, i.e., each person cannot be viewed as providing an independent response.\n\nIn the NLTCS these problems are minimized because the sample design is relatively simple. In 1982 the population was only stratified on age, sex and race. In 1984 there was the additional complication that only 47.4% of the non-disabled community dwelling persons were screened-adding an additional weighting factor.\n\nThe problem in analysis is that stratification and sample clustering (clustering has little effect in this design) affect the estimate of error variance which is used in our test statistics to determine if a particular hypothesis should be accepted or rejected. The analytic problem is to determine how the sample design affects the variance of our parameter estimates. There are two analytic approaches to this problem. The first is to use some model of randomization to increase the error variance to provide a conservative adjustment to our test statistics. There are several analytic computer programs extant that do this for continuous variables in simple regression models. However, given the simple nature of the study design certain simple calculations can be used to adjust variance estimates. This was illustrated by the Census Bureau for the 1982 cross-sectional sample. A table of adjusted factors is provided in Table 4 below.\n\nTABLE 4. \"a\" and \"b\" Parameters and \"f\" Factors for Computing Approximate Standard Errors of Estimated Numbers and Percentages of Persons Characteristic Parameters \"f\" factor a b Black persons or persons receiving medicaid -.00008227 2094 1.4 All other -.00004027 1025 1\n\nIn Table 4 are the parameters for two regression equations. Both were obtained by regressing the estimate on the variance of the estimate for each of two groups, i.e., \"blacks or persons receiving Medicaid\" and \"all others.\" What one does is take the number of persons having a particular characteristic in 1982 and multiply the square of that number by parameter a, and the number itself by parameter b, and add the two products. The square root of this number is the standard error of the estimate. To illustrate, in the 1982 survey there were estimated to be 1,190,764 aged persons requiring personal help in bathing. The formula described above is, symbolically\n\nStandard error of x = ax2 + bx * f\n\nIf, as for the example, f = 1.0, then the calculation is\n\nStandard error of x = (-.00004027)(1,190,764)2 + (1025)(1,190,764) * (1.0)\n\nor, 34,109.\n\nThus, the one standard deviation (68%) confidence interval, is ±34,109 or 1,156,655 to 1,224,873. The 95% confidence interval would be ±2*(34,109). For the confidence interval of differences one uses\n\nStandard error of difference = s2x + s2y - 2r * (sx * sy)\n\nwhere sx and sy are the standard errors of the two estimates to be compared and r is the correlation coefficient (which can often assumed to be zero). Alternatively, for the 1982 tables, the standard errors of both numbers and percentages were calculated. These are presented in Table 5.\n\nTABLE 5 A. Standard Errors of Estimated Percentages of Persons Base of estimated percentage (thousands) Estimated Percentage 2 or 98 5 or 95 10 or 90 25 or 75 50 25 2.8 4.4 6.1 8.8 10.1 50 2.0 3.1 4.3 6.2 7.2 100 1.4 2.2 3.0 4.4 5.1 250 0.9 1.4 1.9 2.8 3.2 500 0.6 1.0 1.4 2.0 2.3 750 0.5 0.8 1.1 1.6 1.8 1000 0.4 0.7 1.0 1.4 1.6 2000 0.3 0.5 0.7 1.0 1.1 3000 0.3 1.4 0.6 0.8 0.9 4000 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.8 5000 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.6 0.7 B. Standard Errors of Estimated Numbers (in thousands) Size of Estimate Size of Estimate Standard Error Size of Estimate Standard Error Size of Estimate 25 5.1 1000 31.4 50 7.2 2000 43.5 100 10.1 3000 52.1 250 15.9 4000 58.8 500 22.4 5000 64.2 750 27.3 - -\n\nThe numbers in these tables need to be multiplied by the appropriate \"f\" values in Table 4. We do not yet have similar tables for the 1984 survey. However, knowing the size of the various sub-samples in 1982 we can present the coefficient of variation for different of the 1982 subsamples (i.e. 10,250 is the number of non-disabled persons planned to be screened in 1984; N=6,089 was approximately the number of persons interviewed in 1982; 1,712 was the number of persons institutionalized before April 1, 1982, and 856 and 428 are half and a quarter of that number). These numbers are presented in Table 6.\n\nTABLE 6. CV's for Variance Rates and Sample Sizes Sample Size Rate CV - n = 10,250 1% .127 1.6% gives a 10% CV 5% .056 10% .038 25% .022 50% .013 n = 6,089 1% .165 2.7% gives a 10% CV 5% .072 10% .050 25% .029 50% .017 n = 1,712 1% .311 8.9% gives a 10% CV 5% .136 10% .094 25% .054 50% .031 n = 856 1% .439 16.3% gives a 10% CV 5% .193 10% .133 25% .077 50% .044 n = 428 1% .622 28.1% gives a 10% CV 5% .272 10% .187 25% .108 50% .062\n\nAn alternative approach to adjusting error variance estimates for sample design effects is based upon the realization that many of these design effects may be of substantive interest. Thus, an alternative approach is to explicitly model the design factors as part of one's analysis so that design effects are explicitly represented. Such an approach has the advantage of helping us better understand the mechanisms generating the phenomenon but the disadvantage of requiring that the correct model be developed. Though it may seem tedious and difficult to search for the \"correct\" model, rather than using a \"general\" model of randomization, it should be realized that only by producing the correct model can one really generalize the parameter estimates made beyond the particular sample, i.e., either to the general population or in forecasts of future needs. Thus, in many more situations than normally realized, the search for a model based adjustment for complex sample design effects is a necessity.\n\nA second analytic stage where sample weights are used is in \"post\" weighting, i.e., where one wishes to recombine parameter estimates for sub-groups to produce the parameter estimates for the total population that was sampled. This usually involves re-weighting the data to reflect the inverse of the probability of selection. This is actually a purely algebraic procedure that is independent of the methods to calculate the effects of sample weights on statistical inferences.\n\nV. EXPLOITATION OF THE LONGITUDINAL NATURE OF THE SURVEYS AND LINKED MEDICARE SERVICE DATA\n\nIn this section we discuss how the cross-temporal nature of the file can be exploited in several types of analyses of transition. The longitudinal nature of the file can be exploited in several ways. The first, and most basic, is simply to analyze changes in characteristics between 1982 and 1984. This is illustrated in Table 7 for disability and institutional status.\n\nTABLE 7. Percentage Distribution of Case Status in 1984 by Case Status in 1982 1982 Status 1984 Status Nondisabled IADL Only 1-2 ADL 3-4 ADL 5-6 ADL Institutional Deceased - Nondisabled 79.66 4.54 3.17 1.12 1.02 1.76 8.73 100.00 IADL Only 12.18 39.39 19.13 4.73 4.20 5.66 14.72 100.00 1 or 2 ADLs 7.10 14.10 32.87 12.36 6.35 7.49 19.73 100.00 3 or 4 ADLs 4.74 4.13 17.22 22.05 18.62 9.98 23.26 100.00 5 or 6 ADLs 4.13 4.49 7.19 8.84 30.00 9.60 35.75 100.00 Institutional 1.48 1.06 0.95 1.07 1.05 53.71 40.67 100.00 Aged-in 89.85 3.08 2.23 1.45 1.32 0.94 1.13 100.00 - All Cases in 1984 60.32 7.06 6.80 3.28 3.39 6.81 12.35 100.00 All Cases in 1982 63.28 8.52 9.70 4.21 4.74 9.56 0.00 100.00 Totals may not add to 100.00 due to rounding.\n\nDown the left hand side of the table we present the percentage distribution of persons (weighted counts) by their status in 1982. Across the table we provide the status (including death) of persons in 1984. We see that the largest proportion of persons remain in the same state that they were in 1982, or, for the most disabled, they experienced high death rates. Interestingly, there are also sizeable numbers of persons who had long term (2+ years) functional improvements. For persons with 5 to 6 ADL's in 1982 nearly a quarter improved status by 1984. Given the high mortality rate for persons with this level of impairment (~36%) and only a moderate level of institutionalization, this suggests that the functional impairment is driven by an acute morbid condition that often produce death, but also often result in improved LTC functional status.\n\nThis table can also be stratified by other variables. For example, in Table 8, we have decomposed changes in disability by age.\n\nTABLE 8. Percentage Distribution of Case Status in 1984 by Case Status in 1982, By Age 1982 Status 1984 Status Nondisabled IADL Only 1-2 ADLs 3-4 ADLs 5-6 ADLs Institutional Deceased Nondisabled 65 to 74 years 86.38 3.56 1.91 0.88 0.63 0.58 6.06 75 to 84 years 71.30 6.21 4.75 1.34 1.47 2.93 12.01 85+ years 45.39 7.30 9.51 2.71 3.14 9.33 22.61 IADL Only 65 to 74 years 17.00 45.09 16.47 3.67 3.49 3.15 11.13 75 to 84 years 10.32 35.93 20.85 5.53 4.40 7.14 15.84 85+ years 1.58 30.55 22.90 5.93 5.97 9.66 23.41 1 or 2 ADLs 65 to 74 years 8.91 17.84 35.60 12.66 5.73 4.35 14.90 75 to 84 years 6.95 13.92 33.22 11.05 4.97 7.72 22.18 85+ years 4.19 7.81 27.37 14.32 10.06 12.61 23.64 3 or 4 ADLs 65 to 74 years 7.56 5.68 24.07 24.56 15.20 4.62 18.33 75 to 84 years 3.85 3.60 16.37 21.47 19.35 11.93 23.43 85+ years 1.44 2.40 6.96 18.78 23.22 15.77 31.43 5 or 6 ADLs 65 to 74 years 5.24 7.05 8.90 10.07 31.70 6.10 30.95 75 to 84 years 4.87 4.39 6.54 8.80 30.24 10.96 34.20 85+ years 1.22 0.70 5.60 6.99 26.98 12.81 45.71 Institutional 65 to 74 years 4.05 1.41 1.99 2.30 1.42 60.26 28.57 75 to 84 years 1.53 1.67 1.37 0.89 1.25 55.25 38.03 85+ years 0.35 0.35 0.13 0.71 0.70 49.50 48.26\n\nIn Table 8 we see that there are decided shifts with age to higher levels of disability and that, at advanced ages (85+) there is a lower proportion of persons who improve and a higher proportion who become more disabled.\n\nThe above discrete state, discrete time description of transitions can become unreliable as one attempts to stratify those transitions by more than one additional variable (e.g., stratify them by age and marital status and the cell sizes become small). To deal with this problem it is necessary to use some type of regression model where the transitions are made functions of a set of covariates. Usually, in order to conduct such modeling, some assumptions have to be made about the form of the dependency of the transitions on the covariates (e.g., in the Cox regression model it is assumed that each covariate has a proportional impact on the transitions).\n\nSuch models simply describe the probability of a change in state, as the states are described in the survey, over the two-year period. Obviously, this does not tell us how to exploit the rich data on the use of different types of Medicare Part A services over the two-year period. These data can be exploited to different degrees by models with different degrees of sophistication.\n\nOne approach is to simply aggregate different types of service use over specified periods of time. The problem with this approach is that it can produce severely misleading results due to the fact that events like death--or even other types of service use--represent constraints on the amounts of specific types of services that an individual consumes in a given period of time. Thus, a person who was in a nursing home for a year and used 20 days of home health care in a two-year period, used home health care twice as fast when eligible as a person who, in a two-year period used no other type of service.\n\nTo account for these differences in exposures, one must calculate life table type measures of ex- posure for each of the types of services. In these life tables one can deal with the constraints that death, or consumption of other types of services, represents. An illustration of these types of life tables is presented in Figure 4.\n\nFIGURE 4. HOSPITAL EPISODES: unavailable at the time of HTML conversion--will be added at a later date.\n\nWhat we have done is to plot the proportion of persons who stay a given number of days in hospitals in 1982 and in 1984 for (a) community disabled persons, (b) persons in institutions at the time of the survey, (c) non-disabled, non-institutionalized persons, and (d) a residual group of non-respondents. To read the table note that the vertical axis describes the proportion of all hospital admissions in the specified year who were still in the hospital after X days. The horizontal axis represents the hospital LOS in days. We see that, in both 1982 and 1984, all groups experienced a decline in LOS and that non-disabled persons had the shortest stays, community disabled the next shortest stays and institutionalized persons the third longest stays, i.e., the hospital LOS was correlated with severity of the chronic conditions the person had. In calculating such tables one has to be careful to post-weight observations, and to deal with \"exposure\" weights based upon when the survey was conducted in the year, or misleading results may be produced.\n\nThese life tables can be used to describe how different types of services are used in a specified period of time after adjusting for exposure differences. To combine that longitudinal information with data from the surveys on chronic functional and health problems can be done by certain multivariate procedures.\n\nVI. FILE STRUCTURE AND ACCESS\n\nThe public use form of the NLTCS is found on two separate tape files. The first is a rectangular tape file which contains, on a person based record, all survey data for persons in the longitudinal two cross-sectional samples (N=25,401). A rectangular file was created in order to facilitate the processing of the tape by persons with limited programming resources. That is, the original version of the file released from the Census Bureau has six record types (sample person, caregiver/children, and household members, separate by survey year). Each of these files has different numbers of cases. In order to use the data from the caregiver file with data on the individual, one had to write a program linking across the two record types. In the current file all record types are already linked together in one large record. Clearly we have attempted to trade off between a less compact form of data storage (there will be many more blank fields in such a rectangularized file) for greater ease in processing.\n\nThe second type of file is that containing the Medicare Part A bill files. This file is not person based since there can be up to 120 bills for a given person. Rather this file is bill-based and retains all the data (e.g., exact beginning and end dates) for each service episode. Certain standard edits have been performed on this file. Within each individual the bills are sorted by transaction type, then admission date. Thus, to use the bill data with the survey record one must perform the linkage operation using special survey identifiers that are found on both files.\n\nThe two files are available separately in EBCDIC form on 6250 bpi tape with standard labels from NTIS. The documentation includes instructions to the interviewers, copies of all survey instruments, instructions on sample weight calculations, and detailed codebooks on the rectangular survey and bill files. In addition there is a technical write-up on the creation of the file and its logical structure.\n\nVII. SUMMARY\n\nThe 1982 and 1984 NLTCS are large nationally representative surveys of a target population at high risk for high levels of both acute and LTC services. In addition the survey files are linked to Medicare Part A records. These surveys and linked files represent an extremely rich data source describing all the health and functional transitions of individuals in this population, detailed characteristics on the person at the time of the survey and detailed data on informal caregivers. These files can provide extremely valuable information on the service needs of the LTC population, changes in those needs and associated acute care needs.\n\nII. NATIONAL LONG TERM CARE CHANNELING DEMONSTRATION\n\nJudith Wooldridge, George Carcagno, Shari Miller Dunstan, and Nancy Holden, Mathematica Policy Research\n\nPeter Kemper, National Center for Health Services Research, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nIn September 1980 the National Long Term Care (LTC) Demonstration--known as channeling-- was initiated by three units of the United States Department of Health and Human Services--the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the Administration on Aging, and the Health Care Financing Administration. It was to be a rigorous test of comprehensive case management of community care as a way to contain the rapidly increasing costs of LTC for the impaired elderly while providing adequate care to those in need.\n\nA. The Intervention\n\nChanneling was designed to use comprehensive case management to allocate community services appropriately to the frail elderly in need of LTC. The specific goal was to enable elderly persons, whenever appropriate, to stay in their own homes rather than entering nursing homes. Channeling financed direct community services, to a lesser or greater degree according to the channeling model, but always as part of a comprehensive plan for care in the community. It had no direct control over medical or nursing home expenditures.\n\nChanneling was implemented to work through local channeling projects. The core of the intervention (i.e., case management) consisted of seven features:\n\nOutreach to identify and attract potential clients who were at high risk of entering a LTC institution.\n\nStandardized eligibility screening to determine whether an applicant met the following preestablished criteria:\n\nAge: had to be 65 years or older.\n\nFunctional disability: had to have two moderate disabilities in performing activities of daily living (ADL), or three severe impairments in ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), or two severe IADL impairments and one severe ADL disability. Cognitive or behavioral difficulties affecting ability to perform ADL could count as one of the severe IADL impairments.\n\nUnmet needs: had to have an unmet need (expected to last for at least six months) for two or more services or an informal support system in danger of collapse.\n\nResidence: had to be living in the community or (if institutionalized) certified as likely to be discharged within three months.\n\nMedicare coverage: for the financial control model, had to be eligible for Medicare Part A.\n\nComprehensive inperson assessment to identify individual client problems, resources, and service needs in preparation for developing a care plan.\n\nInitial care planning to specify the types and amounts of care required to meet the identified needs of clients.\n\nService arrangement to implement the care plan through the provision of both formal and informal in-home and community services.\n\nOngoing monitoring to ensure that services were appropriately delivered and continued to meet client needs.\n\nPeriodic reassessment to adjust care plans to changing client needs.\n\nTwo models of channeling were tested. The basic case management model relied primarily on the core features. The channeling project assumed responsibility for helping clients gain access to needed services and for coordinating the services of multiple providers. This model provided a small amount of additional funding to purchase direct services to fill in gaps in existing programs. But it relied primarily on what was already available in each community, thus testing the premise that the major difficulties in the current system were problems of information and coordination which could be solved largely by client-centered case management.\n\nThe financial control model differed from the basic model in several ways:\n\nIt expanded service coverage to include a broad range of community services.\n\nIt established a funds pool to ensure that services could be allocated on the basis of need and appropriateness rather than on the eligibility requirements of specific categorical programs.\n\nIt empowered case managers to authorize the amount, duration, and scope of services paid out of the funds pool, making them accountable for the full package of community services.\n\nIt imposed two limits on expenditures from the funds pool. First, for the entire caseload, average estimated expenditures under care plans could not exceed 60 percent of the average nursing home rate in the area. Second, for an individual client, estimated care plan expenditures could not exceed 85 percent of that rate without special approval.\n\nIt required clients to share in the cost of services if their income exceeded 200 percent of the state's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility level plus the food stamp bonus amount.\n\nTen sites participated in the demonstration. Their model designations were:\n\nBasic Case Management Model Financial Control Model Baltimore, Maryland Cleveland, Ohio Eastern Kentucky Greater Lynn, Massachusetts Houston, Texas Miami, Florida Middlesex County, New Jersey Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Southern Maine Rensselaer County, New York\n\nThe ten local projects opened their doors to clients between February and June of 1982, and were fully operational through June of 1984.\n\nThe goal of the evaluation, in addition to documenting the implementation of channeling, was to identify its effect on:\n\nThe use of formal health and LTC services, particularly hospital, nursing home, and community services.\n\nPublic and private expenditures for health services and LTC.\n\nIndividual outcomes, including mortality, physical functioning, unmet service needs, and social/psychological well-being.\n\nCaregiving by family and friends, including the amount of care provided, the amount of financial support provided, and caregiver stress, satisfaction, and well-being.\n\nTo compare channeling's outcomes with what would have happened in the absence of channeling, the evaluation relied on an experimental design. Applicants found eligible for channeling were randomly assigned either to a treatment group or to a control group. In all, 6,341 persons were randomly assigned.\n\nSeveral data sources were used. These included telephone and in-person surveys of the elderly members of the research sample and, for a subset, their primary informal caregivers; Medicare, Medicaid, channeling project, and provider records; and official death records obtained from state agencies. Finally, federal, state, local, and project staff were interviewed about the implementation and operation of the demonstration (these data are not included in the public use files).\n\nB. The Nature of the Data\n\nSome researchers will want to use the data to replicate the channeling results or explore certain issues in greater depth. They will simply have to master the complexity of the data base. Others will be interested in using the data to support efforts far removed from the original purposes of the evaluation. This section is written primarily for this latter group.\n\nThe channeling sample was designed to support the evaluation, it was not designed to be a statistically representative sample of the elderly. The sample consists of frail persons who voluntarily applied to channeling and were found to meet the demonstration's eligibility criteria. Channeling sought referral sources and engaged in outreach activities to identify applicants at risk of institutionalization. Hospitals, home health agencies and social service providers were the major referral sources. A breakdown of the referral sources is presented in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1.

Using data from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), we simulated channeling's eligibility process to identify a subsample who were eligible for channeling. The simulation was done by selecting individuals who would have qualified according to the channeling ADL or IADL criterion. We thus ended up with a subsample from the NLTCS who, at least according to the measures of functioning, resembled the channeling sample. On the basis of that simulation, we estimated that 4.9 percent of the total noninstitutionalized population age 65 or over in 1982 qualified for channeling.\n\nThe main differences between the channeling sample and the simulated nationally eligible sample were in living arrangements, income, and formal service use (see Table 2). Channeling clients were more likely to live alone and less likely to be married. Their use of regular informal in-home care was about the same as for the simulated national sample. The income of the channeling sample was lower than the income of the national sample. Substantial differences were found in every measure of formal service use. Before the receipt of channeling services, compared to the simulated national sample, channeling sample members were almost twice as likely to be receiving formal in-home services, more than twice as likely to have had a hospital stay in the last two months, more than six times as likely to have been in a nursing home, and almost five times as likely to have been on a nursing home waiting list. These differences provide strong support for the argument that persons often came to the attention of channeling because of some precipitating event and were probably more closely connected with the community care system as a result. The occurrence of such an event may have been a major factor that differentiated those who applied for channeling from those who did not.\n\nTABLE 2.

As a group, the demonstration sites were broadly similar to the nation as a whole. The only characteristics on which they differed markedly was the proportion who were of Hispanic origin (4.6 percent of the channeling sample were Hispanic, compared with 2.7 percent of the national elderly population). This resulted mainly from the fact that a third of the aged individuals in Miami were of Hispanic origin. Despite the general correspondence with national data, as one might expect, there was substantial variation across sites and models.\n\nWith respect to the economic resources of the aged population in the channeling sites, monthly median family income was similar to the national data, although there were more people below the poverty threshold in the basic model than in the United States as a whole, and fewer below that level in the financial control model. The proportion of aged in the demonstration states enrolled in Medicare and monthly Medicare expenditures per aged resident were similar to the national data. For Medicaid participation, the basic states had slightly more people receiving Medicaid, and the financial control states somewhat less, than the national average. Monthly Medicaid expenditures per aged resident were somewhat less than the national average in the basic model states and somewhat greater in the financial control states because of high expenditures in New York and Massachusetts.\n\nTo this point the focus has been on comparing the characteristics of the research sample and the aged population in the channeling sites to the national elderly population. What about the sites' service environments, were they broadly representative of the service environments throughout the country? This is a tougher issue to address because comparative data are not readily available. On the basis of an examination of nursing home bed supply data and data on waiting times to nursing home admission collected in the demonstration, we concluded that nursing home beds were probably somewhat less available in the channeling sites than in the nation, although we do not believe this had a major effect on demonstration outcomes.\n\nData on the availability of community care are even more limited. We do know that there was substantial control group use of both comprehensive case management services (10-20 percent) and of community in-home services (60-69 percent). The demonstration projects applied to participate in the demonstration and were selected through a competitive process, and it could be that their case management and community care systems were more developed than those in other sites. Users of the data base should consider whether such differences could affect their research results.\n\nTaken together, these comparisons indicate that, even though the channeling sample is not a statistically representative sample of the frail elderly, the data can be used for applications unrelated to the evaluation as long as the differences that do exist between the channeling sample and one that would be broadly representative are not central to a particular application, and as long as careful attention is paid to the limitations of the data set.\n\nIn using the data, the treatment and control groups can be exploited in useful ways. The control group data tell us what occurred in the sites in the absence of channeling. For example, the control group data reveal what services people who were eligible for channeling were using at the time channeling was in operation. The treatment group data indicate what services people used in response to the channeling intervention, although for this purpose, the model differences are obviously critical. These data could be used as the basis for estimating, for example, the cost of a new benefit, although such an exercise requires using a great deal of judgment in evaluating the similarities and differences between channeling and its participating population and whatever program and population are being analyzed. Furthermore, estimates of program participation must be made, a critical task which cannot be addressed using the channeling data. If possible, when using the channeling data for purposes unrelated to evaluating channeling, other data sources should be used and care taken to evaluate the effects of changing key assumptions.\n\nThe channeling data base is very comprehensive and detailed. In exchange for that richness, one gives up representativeness. Nevertheless, it can be a very useful source of data in support of applications far removed from the evaluation of channeling.\n\nII. DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATA BASE\n\nOne of the goals of the evaluation was to produce data for public use after the initial evaluation was completed. Thus, in developing the project data files and documentation, we always had the outside uses in mind. The principles followed in selecting data for public use were as follows:\n\nAll data that were used in the analyses should be available so that evaluation analyses could be replicated from the files.\n\nPrinciple (1) should be achieved subject to maintaining the confidentiality of data.\n\nAs much data as possible should be included in the public use files.\n\nAlthough the preparation of the public use files was always planned, their implementation occurred over the last six months of the project, to ensure that all variables used in analyses were available and documented for inclusion in the files.\n\nThe public use files were prepared from the project's data base. This data base was designed in the first 18 months of the project, and implemented in March 1982 at the time that screening and sample member randomization began. As new instruments were designed, pretested, and cleared by OMB, the data base was expanded to include new files.\n\nSample intake occurred over a period of 15 months, and primary data collection continued until July 1984, providing up to 18 months of followup. Secondary data associated with the followup period (claims data, death records, and provider records) continued to be acquired over the ensuing four months.\n\nIII. SAMPLE\n\nA. Sample Design\n\nTo compare the outcomes of channeling with what would have happened in the absence of channeling, the evaluation relied on an experimental design. Elderly persons who were referred to each channeling project were interviewed (most by telephone) by the project staff to determine their eligibility for channeling. If eligible, they were randomly assigned either to a treatment group, whose members could participate in channeling, or to a control group, whose members continued to rely on whatever services were otherwise available in their community. A total of 6,341 persons were randomly assigned to the two models of channeling. Given the substantial death rate among this population, as well as interview noncompletion, this yielded research samples of varying sizes, depending on the analysis. Table 3 shows the maximum sample sizes available for different subject areas for each model.\n\nTABLE 3.

Sample Characteristics\n\nThe channeling sample was elderly and frail, with severe functional, health, social, and financial problems. This was by design; the eligibility criteria for the sample were intended to identify persons who were at risk of nursing home placement. The characteristics of the channeling clients at baseline are shown in Table 4.\n\nTABLE 4. Characteristics of Channeling Treatment Group at Baseline - Basic Case Management Model Financial Control Model All Sites Health and Functioning Any disability in ADL (percent) 83.4 84.2 83.9 Number of ADL disabilities (maximum 5) 2.7 2.8 2.7 Incontinent (percent) 52.5 53.6 53.1 Any impairment in IADL (percent) 99.5 99.8 99.7 Mental functioning (number incorrect on 10-item scale) 3.4 3.5 3.5 Days restricted to bed in last two months 19.5 20.1 19.8 Sociodemographic Characteristics Living alone (percent) 35.1 39.1 37.2 Age (years) 79.2 80.1 79.7 Ethnic group (percent white) 75.6 71.1 73.3 Sex (percent female) 71.9 70.6 71.2 Married (percent) 31.9 32.9 32.4 Income and Assets Monthly income (dollars) 567 572 570 Owns home (percent) 44.7 38.9 41.7 No assets other than home (percent) 59.4 55.1 57.2 Medicaid coverage (percent) 20.4 23.7 22.1 Life Quality Stressful life event in past year (percent) Often lonely (percent) 27.0 25.7 26.3 No social contacts in past week (percent) 9.4 10.2 9.8 Number of unmet needs (maximum 8) 3.3 4.0 3.7 Not very satisfied with life (percent) 39.5 47.4 43.7 Waitlisted or applied to nursing home (percent) 7.3 6.3 6.8 Unwilling to go into nursing home (percent) 63.4 67.3 65.5 Prior Service Use Case management received (percent) 8.8 16.9 13.1 Regular formal in-home care (percent) 57.4 63.5 60.6 Regular informal in-home care (percent) 92.5 92.0 92.2 Hospital admission, past two months (percent) 47.2 49.9 48.7 SAMPLE SIZES: Basic model 1,638; financial model 1,815.\n\nIV. DATA SOURCES AND DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES\n\nBoth primary and secondary data were collected for the channeling evaluation. These data were collected from the following sources:\n\nInterviews with sample members and proxies\n\nInterviews with informal caregivers\n\nProvider records\n\nMedicare and Medicaid claims\n\nDeath records\n\nClient tracking records\n\nFinancial control system at five sites.\n\nThis section reviews the primary data collection and provider records extracting procedures.1 The data collection through surveys, the means of collection, and the interviewer auspices were as follows:\n\nScreen, telephone interview, administered by demonstration screening unit.\n\nSample member baseline, personal interview, administered by demonstration assessment staff (for clients) or MPR interviewers (for controls).\n\nSample member followup interviews (6, 12, and 18 months), personal or telephone interview, administered by MPR interviewers.\n\nCaregiver baseline and followup interviews (6 and 12 months), personal or telephone interview, administered by MPR interviewers.\n\nProvider record extracts, collected by trained extractors.\n\nTraining materials and procedures for the baseline were developed by MPR in conjunction with Temple University, the demonstration's technical assistance contractor, and all trainers were trained by MPR and Temple staff. Demonstration screen and sample member (client) baseline interviewers were trained by Temple University. All MPR interviewers and extractors were trained by MPR project staff. To assess the comparability of the baselines administered by demonstration and MPR staff, a random validation sample of clients was administered a baseline by both demonstration and MPR staff.\n\nTraining was intensive for all instruments. For example, MPR baseline interviewers received five days of training that covered the instruments, procedures, sensitivity training, practice sessions, and evaluation of interviews. The demonstration baseline interviewer staff received the same training plus instruction on collecting clinical data for case management. Sample member followup interviewers were provided with comparable training, augmented by special training on searching for respondents and determining living arrangements. For the caregiver instrument, additional special training was provided on techniques for identifying appropriate caregivers, procedures to follow if the sample member was deceased, and techniques for telephone interviewing. Provider records extractor training covered the use of a provider characteristics instrument and procedures for extracting service use, charge, and reimbursement data from provider records. Respondent payments were made to control group members for baseline interviews and all sample members for followup interviews.\n\nCompletion rates for the interviews and provider records extraction are listed in Table 5. If deceased sample members are removed from the calculation, the response rates were uniformly high, at 76 percent or more.\n\nTABLE 5. Completion Rates by Instrument Instrument Treatment Control Total Sample Members Baseline 93.3 82.9 88.9 6-Month Followup 75.2 a 73.4 a 74.5 a 12-Month Followup 65.8 a 62.7 a 64.6 a 18-Month Followup 56.6 a 55.0 a 55.9 a Caregivers Baseline 71.2 83.6 76.0 6-Month Followup 82.4 77.7 80.4 12-Month Followup 82.4 75.6 79.4 Community Service Provider Records Extract --- --- 85.5 Institutional Service Provider Records Extract --- --- 82.8\n\nThe major reason for nonresponse was that the sample member had died. The percent of the sample not responding because deceased was 16.5 percent at 6 months, 26.6 percent at 12 months, and 40.9 percent at 18 months.\n\nV. DATA PROCESSING\n\nEach of the public use files was derived from one or more data base masterfiles, which, in turn, were created and maintained according to a standard set of procedures. These procedures transformed source data from data entry files into a structured data set, edited the data, and created a set of constructed variables.\n\nA. Interview Data Procedures\n\nBecause these data were collected over a period ranging from one to two-and-a-half years, depending upon the data source, data were regularly added to the data base. Each cycle of data processing included the following steps: quality control checks of hard-copy interview forms; data entry; transmission of data to the research data base; quality control checks of computerized data; and the updating of both the status file and the existing masterfiles. Figure 1 summarizes these components.\n\nFIGURE 1. Standard Data Manipulation Procedures: unavailable at the time of HTML conversion--will be added at a later date.\n\nQuality Control and Data Entry. Completed instruments were manually edited and coded by trained quality control staff. This included checking the legibility of contact information, assigning codes to open-ended and \"other, specify\" responses, and reviewing key questions to ensure they were properly recorded. If necessary, project staff or respondents were contacted to resolve problems.\n\nAfter the documents had been read, they were entered into the computer. Automated skip logic, range, and consistency checks were performed as part of the key entry program. When errors were found, a trained data cleaner reviewed the instrument (if necessary, the cleaner telephoned the respondent or interviewer) and corrected the error in the instrument and on the file. Finally, once a batch of interviews had passed the skip logic, range, and consistency checks, the batch was verified by reentry.\n\nData Transmission and Initial Processing. Every month, all data-entered instruments were transmitted to the mainframe computer in Extended Binary-Coded-Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) format. During the initial processing of the newly transmitted data, this file was transformed into a structured intermediate SAS data set. The project status file was also updated at this time with new status information. In addition, the intermediate file picked up the data base ID and randomization information from the status file for each record. Finally, confidential variables (such as Medicare and Medicaid numbers) were added to a separate Medicare/Medicaid status monitoring file.\n\nFrequency distributions and other descriptive statistics were generated for each variable. In addition, range checks and further checks on consistency which were beyond the capacity of the data entry program were performed. For example, in processing each file, we printed selected variables for cases which appeared to have more than one interview (such as a complete and an incomplete interview).\n\nData Entry. Potential errors identified through a review of descriptive statistics were resolved by reviewing the hard-copy questionnaire and/or consulting with the quality control staff (who recontacted the interviewer or respondent when necessary). Some \"errors\" (for example, some out-of-range responses) proved to be correct, and the values were retained in the data base. The frequency and nature of each type of error were documented, as was its resolution. In this way, resolution decisions could be consistent and based on precedent, where applicable.\n\nMasterfile Maintenance and Updating. After inconsistencies in the intermediate file were resolved, the current masterfile was updated with the new observations. For each of the new observations added to the masterfile, certain descriptive variable values were converted into standard binary codes. Once the masterfile had been updated with the new observations, frequencies of the new masterfile were produced, reviewed, and distributed periodically to the research staff.\n\nOnce-Only Procedures. After all the completed research sample interviews had been processed and added to a masterfile via the process outlined above, a final review of the complete masterfile was undertaken. The same range and consistency checks used in initial processing were applied to the complete masterfile. In addition, descriptive statistics of all variables in the final masterfile were closely reviewed and distributed to research staff.\n\nOther Data. Comparable procedures were followed in processing secondary data into masterfiles.\n\nB. Developing Analysis Files\n\nOne of the products generated from the data base masterfiles was a set of analysis files--files which contain only the sample and variables of interest for a particular analysis. Because analysis files are smaller than masterfiles, their contents can easily be accessed for use in statistical analysis procedures. Some of the public use files were generated from analysis files. This section describes three steps in the creation of the research data base analysis files.\n\nSelecting the Samples. A set of standard samples was defined in order to facilitate consistency across analyses. Once a standard sample was defined, a binary variable, or \"sample flag,\" was created and permanently stored in the status file, facilitating the selection of the standard sample for use with any masterfile. In addition, since some analyses used subsets of the standard samples, many individual analysis files contained sample flags and data for several samples, allowing analyses of several samples.\n\nSpecifying and Programming Constructed Variables. Initial specifications of constructed analysis variables (both dependent and independent) were prepared by the analysts. These preliminary specifications were reviewed and modified by the research data base staff, in consultation with the analysts. Constructed variables were programmed, variable labels defined, and descriptive statistics produced and reviewed for each variable.\n\nExtracting and Merging Data from Masterfile. Analysis files were generally \"extracts\" (i.e., sub- sets) of masterfiles. These extracts were based on defined samples that were selected using standard sample flags. However, some analysis files required data from more than one masterfile (for example, client tracking and status change masterfiles and caregiver and sample member masterfiles). In these cases, extracts of each file were merged together, so that a single case contained the correct information from each file.\n\nVI. PUBLIC USE FILES\n\nThere are 14 separate public use files, nine based on survey instruments, four based on analysis files and the project status file. Table 6 summarizes the content of the files at a general level and describes the purposes for which the data were collected.\n\nTABLE 6. Summary of Public-Use File Contents Public-Use File Sample Description Focus of Data Reports Contributing Analytical Variables Screen Applicants randomized during the the caseload buildup phase. a The major purpose of the screening assessment was to determine whether an applicants was eligible to participate. It was intended to identify those at risk of institutionalization, focusing on age, place of residence, interest in participating, institutionalization status, functional impairment in performing activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), fragility of support system, and unmet needs. b Baseline Applicants randomized during the caseload buildup phase who completed both a screen and a baseline instrument. The major purpose of the baseline instrument was to collect data on sample members at the point of enrollment, measuring functioning, health status, recent service use, informal caregiving, financial resources, demographic factors, and unmet needs. b Client Tracking/Status Change All channeling clients. c The client tracking and status change forms were designed to allow client progress to be monitored through the channeling service system, as well as caseload size. The client tracking form included dates of referral to channeling, screening, randomization, care plan completion, and service initiation; the status change forms collected dates of change from active to inactive or terminated status and reasons for change of status.\n\nThornton, Will, and Davies, 1986.\n\nCarcagno, et al., 1986.\n\nSample Member Followup: 6-Month File, 12-Month File, and 18-Month File Applicants randomized into the research sample during the caseload buildup phase who also completed a screening interview, a baseline interview, and a followup interview. The purpose of the followup interviews was to collect outcome data at 6, 12, and 18 months after enrollment. Outcomes included insurance coverage, health status, housing conditions, expenditures, related transfers and services, in-home service use and support, formal community service use, hospital and nursing home use, social and psychological well-being, income and assets, and functioning. - Status File Applicants randomized during the caseload buildup phase. a The status file stores information about interview dates and completion (both complete and non-complete) status for each sample member, sample flags d, and information obtained from the death records search and Medicare and Medicaid entitlement checks.\n\nWooldridge and Schore, 1986.\n\nCaregiver Baseline Primary informal caregivers (to a subset of those sample members included in the screen public-use file e) who completed a caregiver baseline interview. The caregiver baseline measured the amount of various types of informal services provided to the elderly sample members, the provision of financial contributions by informal caregivers, the economic and family behavior of informal caregivers, and caregiver psychological and social well-being.\n\nChristianson and Stephens, 1984.\n\nChristianson, 1986.\n\nCaregiver Followups: 6-Month File and 12-Month File Primary informal caregivers (to a subset of those sample members included in the screen public-use file e) who completed a 6- or 12-month caregiver interview. The primary purpose was to collect data to assess the impacts of channeling on informal caregivers of elderly sample members. Questions focus on care by primary informal caregiver, as well as from other caregivers, the provision of financial contributions by informal caregivers, caregiving since institutionalization, formal services utilization prior to the death of the elderly sample member, caregiver well-being, and demographic and employment information.\n\nChristianson, 1986.\n\nFormal Community Services (including Case Management and Housing and Transfers) Analysis File Individuals who were members of at least one of the analysis samples on which these analyses were based. The formal community services analysis file was developed from the sample member followup interviews, provider record extracts, surveys of privately contracted individuals, financial records from the sites, and Medicare and Medicaid claims. It includes information on the use of all major community services and expenditures for these services, by funding source.\n\nCorson et al., 1986.\n\nThornton and Dunstan, 1986.\n\nBrown and Phillips, 1986.\n\nInformal Care Analysis File Individuals who were members of at least one of the analysis samples on which this analysis was based. The informal care analysis file was developed from the sample member followup interviews. It includes information on the types and amounts of services provided by informal caregivers and the relationship of caregivers to sample members.\n\nChristianson, 1986.\n\nHospital, Nursing Home, and Other Medical Services Analysis File Individiuals who were members of at least one of the analysis samples on which this analysis was based. Specifically, this file consists of persons who completed a baseline interview and who were known to be either Medicare entitled or not Medicare entitled. This file was developed from data obtained from Medicare and Medicaid claims, provider records extracts, and sample member followup interviews. Contained in this file is information on hospital, nursing home, and other medical service use and expenditures, by funding source.\n\nWooldridge and Schore, 1986.\n\nQuality of Life Analysis File Individuals who were members of at least one of the analysis samples on which this analysis was based. The quality of life analysis file was developed from the sample member followup interviews. It includes information on elderly sample member satisfaction with care, social-psychological well-being, and functioning.\n\nApplebaum and Harrigan, 1986.\n\nThe caseload buildup phase began in March, May, or June 1982 and ended in May or June 1983, depending on the channeling project. There were applicants randomized during this phase who were not included in this sample; namely, those applicants who were members of the household of a treatment group client, fourteen cases whose screening survey instrument was lost in the mail, and one individual who was eliminated from all samples because, although assigned to the control group, the individual received channeling services.\n\nScreen and baseline standard control variables (contained in this file, as well as in most of the other files) were used in most of the reports listed below.\n\nNote that this sample includes clients who were not included in the samples used for the impact anlaysis--those individuals who enrolled before randomization began, those who were members of the household of a treatment client, and those who enrolled after the research sample size had been achieved and random assignment ceased.\n\nSample flags are binary variables indicating membership in a survey or analysis sample.\n\nThe caregiver subsample includes the caregivers named by the elderly sample members who were enrolled during an approximately six-month period beginning in November, 1982.\n\nConfidentiality Precautions. For confidentiality reasons, some identifying variables were excluded from the public use files. Thus, for example, names and addresses and Medicare and Medicaid ID numbers were not included. Since the user must have a method for linking information on individuals across files, unique ID numbers are used to identify individual data. The ID numbers on the public use files are different from those used by MPR for fielding and analysis.\n\nAdditional confidentiality measures were taken. In order to avoid the possibility that one or more data items could identify, or nearly identify, an individual in a particular site, we reviewed the data and modified some fields. Variables indicating age were transferred from actual ages into age categories. In sites with very small minority populations, ethnicity was recorded by combining categories. In addition, calendar dates are not provided on the files. Instead, each data variable has been converted into a variable that indicates the number of days, screen randomization and the date of the event. Finally, we deleted information on legal guardianship.\n\nPublic Use File Formats. We converted the SAS data sets into sequential (EBCDIC) public use files from which each variable can be accessed by its column position, thus making the file readable in virtually every mainframe computer system.\n\nDocumentation Available. The public use file documentation consists of eleven reports, each of which documents one or more public use files. Each of the eleven reports contains three chapters:\n\nI. Introduction (common to all reports)\n\nII. Description of File\n\nThe development of the file\n\nThe variables included\n\nThe analysis samples included\n\nIII. File Documentation\n\nFile layout: the variables included in the file, by position and field length\n\nInstrument: an annotated version of the survey instrument showing variable names assigned to each question (provided for source files only)\n\nConstructed variable documentation: for each constructed variable a form is provided that describes how the variable was constructed and the values for different categories\n\nDescriptive statistics: frequency distributions and means for all variables included on the file.\n\nPhysical tape specifications: information necessary to read the tape and a dump of the contents of the first two records on the tape\n\nCopies of these 11 reports will be available for review at the breakout sessions of the conference.\n\nPhysical Tape Specifications: Table 7 summarizes the physical specifications of the tapes. Note that all files are available on tape, in EBCDIC. Files are density 6250, fixed block, and no label.\n\nTABLE 7.

APPLICATIONS\n\nAlthough collected and structured for the specific purpose of evaluating the channeling demonstration, the resulting data can be used for a wide variety of other research. In this section, we briefly review completed and planned research, discuss potential applications, and caution users about some pitfalls.\n\nA. Completed and Planned Analyses\n\nAnalyses conducted as part of the channeling evaluation and a followup study of targeting those at high risk of nursing home placement are now completed. A series of detailed technical reports on channeling document the results, data collection procedures, sample definitions, and methodology. Paragraph summaries of the reports and information on ordering them can be found in a summary the of Channeling Demonstration and an abstract list of reports available from the Office of Social Services Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Room 410E, H.H. Humphrey Building, 200 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201. The followup study of targeting is reported by Grannemann et al. (1986). It is currently not available for distribution.\n\nWe are aware of the following analyses that are currently being undertaken with the public use files:\n\nRobert Clark of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of DHHS: (1) estimation of the total cost of care, both public and private, with particular emphasis on out-of-pocket costs, and (2) analysis of service use by the oldest old.\n\nCorbin Liu of the Urban Institute: analysis of the costs of care of older persons with cognitive impairments, both those in nursing homes and those in the community.\n\nPeter Kemper of the National Center for Health Services Research of DHHS: analysis of the determinants of the use of formal and informal community care.\n\nJim Callahan and Phyllis Mutschler of Brandeis University: analysis of changes over one year in the use of all types of care by the control group.\n\nOther research will undoubtedly be initiated as more researchers obtain the public use files.\n\nB. Potential Applications\n\nThe extensive data collected for the channeling evaluation create many research possibilities. Its special purpose--to form the basis of an evaluation--makes it better suited for some analyses than for others. Because it is a selected sample--data came from ten sites selected through competition, and the sample comprises applicants referred to a special community care program-descriptive analysis using the channeling data are less likely to be informative than analysis of the same questions using nationally representative data. The channeling data appear more appropriate for analyses that do not depend on representativeness but capitalize on the richness of the data or their original purpose.\n\nThe channeling data appear most useful for analyses of behavioral relationships, methodological research, or re-analysis of experimental results. The extensive data on the well-being of the elderly sample, for example, is fertile ground for psychometric analysis of quality of life measures or analysis of the determinants of well-being, but would not be appropriate for an analysis of the extent of unmet need in the United States. To estimate the cost of community care and nursing home care for use in calculating premiums for LTC insurance, channeling data would have to be used in conjunction with other data (e.g., a nationally representative sample); otherwise, the estimates would pertain to the selected channeling sample rather than to likely purchasers of LTC insurance.\n\nC. Some Cautions\n\nAlthough the richness and comprehensiveness of the channeling data set open numerous research possibilities, researchers should be aware of their complexity. Researchers accustomed to using cross-section surveys designed to collect data on a population, rather than longitudinal data designed to evaluate a program, are likely to be surprised by the complexity of the channeling data. One researcher who was not involved in the evaluation but has begun using the channeling data remarked that this is \"the most complicated data set [he had] ever seen.\" The complexity arises from the large number of data sources, the structure of the files, and the special evaluation sampling objectives.\n\nThe data sources, as described above, are numerous: five interviews with the elderly sample members or their proxies (screen, baseline, and 6-, 12-, and 18-month followups), three interviews with primary informal caregivers (baseline and 6- and 12-month followups), Medicare claims, Medicaid claims, financial model channeling claims, provider billing records, client tracking data, and death records. The data set thus contains a massive amount of data. Variables can be constructed from more than one source, individually or in combination, so that researchers need to understand exactly how variables on the public use file are constructed before using them in analysis. Not all data are present in every case called for in the design--numerous data sources also provide numerous opportunities for missing data.\n\nEvaluation needs determined the way in which files were structured and variables were constructed. Files were organized, for example, by analytic area so that data needed for a particular analysis were all on one file. Because all analyses controlled for baseline characteristics, a standard set of baseline variables were included among constructed followup variables. Constructed variables also were defined to meet evaluation needs. For example, because some baseline data were not comparably measured for treatment and control groups, screen data were sometimes used when a baseline measure might be better for other purposes.\n\nEvaluation objectives also drove the hundreds of big and little decisions in the design of the data collection. Most important were the sampling decisions which optimized the usefulness of the data for evaluation purposes. Not all data were collected for all sample members. Indeed, the only data that are available for the entire sample are the screen and death records. Two examples will illustrate how sample design decisions could affect analysis possibilities. First, in order to limit the duration of the demonstration, only the first half of the sample to enroll were followed for 18 months. Longitudinal analysis must be limited, therefore, to 12 months of followup data or to the relatively small sample with 18 months of followup data. Second, in order to minimize data collection costs, provider billing records on community care costs were collected only for 20 percent of the sample for the first six months and 10 percent for the second six months. Consequently, data on the community service expenditures of private individuals and government programs other than Medicaid and Medicare are quite limited. Although these and other sample design decisions made sense in the evaluation, they may hinder the use of the data for other purposes.\n\nBefore undertaking a project using the channeling data, it is suggested that researchers begin by assessing the implications of the complexity of the data base for their project by reading the following reports:\n\nThe final report (Kemper et al., 1986), to gain an overview of the evaluation design and available data\n\nThe report on data collection procedures (Phillips et al., 1986), to learn how the data were collected\n\nThe particular technical report on the relevant substantive area, to understand how analysis files were constructed, how samples were defined, what variables were constructed, and what analysis was done as part of the evaluation. (For example, researchers planning analysis of informal care should read the technical report on that subject by Christianson, 1986. In addition, those seeking to replicate the evaluation analysis should read the report on research methodology by Brown, 1986).\n\nOnly after having assessed the complexity of the data and its implications for the contemplated research does it make sense to invest in the purchase of the public use tapes and associated documentation.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nApplebaum, Robert and Margaret Harrigan. \"Channeling Effects on the Quality of Clients' Lives.\" Princeton, New Jersey: Mathematica Policy Research, 1986.\n\nBrown, Randall S. \"Methodological Issues in the Evaluation of the National Long Term Care Demonstration.\" Princeton, New Jersey: Mathematica Policy Research, 1986.

NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY: 1984 SUPPLEMENT ON AGING\n\nNATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY\n\nNCHS Division of Health Interview Statitistics\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is the principal source of information on the health of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States. The NHIS is one of the major data collection programs of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the U.S. and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.\n\nII. PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\nThe objective of the survey is to address major current health issues through the collection and analysis of data on the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the U.S. National data on the incidence of acute illness and injuries, the prevalence of chronic conditions and impairments, the extent of disability, the utilization "
