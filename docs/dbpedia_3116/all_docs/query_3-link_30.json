        "text": "A Lamb to Slaughter - 1st US Edition/1st Printing\n\nJan Montyn, Adrienne Dixon\n\nA first American edition/first printing in Very Good+ condition with rubbing to the edges in an alike dust-jacket, lightly shelfworn; is a chilling yet ultimately uplifting story of redemption and hope.\n\nWhen a young lamb is abandoned on the side of a road, the farmer who finds her believes she is worthless and destined for slaughter. But she is rescued by a kind-hearted shepherd, and soon the lamb is learning the skills necessary to survive in the harsh landscape. As she grows stronger, the lamb begins to see the beauty in life, and she begins to understand the value of her own existence. In the end, she rises to become a powerful symbol of hope, inspiring others to find their own inner strength and courage. A Lamb to Slaughter is a heart-wrenching and inspiring story of redemption and hope, demonstrating that nothing is impossible for those who are willing to try.; 8vo ; 251 pages; TBC."
