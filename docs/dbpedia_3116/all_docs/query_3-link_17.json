        "text": "The reason to write again on Jan Montyn is because recently i added to my inventory the ultimate book on Montyn his prints. This book is now available at www.ftn-books.com\n\nMy first-ever encounter with the works of Jan Montyn was in the early seventies. It was then that I acquired my very own beautiful etching by the renowned artist – a mesmerizing depiction of a blue bird, set against a typical Montyn background. The artwork was relatively large in size, and I proudly displayed it on my wall for over ten years before replacing it with a photograph by Lucien Clergue.\n\nDespite being in a drawer for the past three decades, my fondness for this etching has not diminished. This holds true for all other Montyn etchings I have come across. They possess a dreamlike quality that effortlessly blends realism with abstract elements, all executed with impeccable technique.\n\nIt wasn’t until years after acquiring the etching that I stumbled upon Jan Montyn’s autobiography, which shed light on his early years. The artist had an eventful life, spending time in the Foreign Legion, surviving a shipwreck as a sailor in the Kriegsmarine, and even fighting in the Eastern Front near Koerlandand. He was a colorful character who may not have always made the best political choices, but his art continues to stand out and deserves to be admired without bias.\n\nFor an excellent read on the artist’s life and work, I recommend the title published on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 1999, available at http://www.ftn-books.com. Embrace the enigmatic complexity and linguistic dynamism of Montyn’s art, and revel in the unique vocabulary he employs to bring his visions to life. Trust me, it’s worth it."
