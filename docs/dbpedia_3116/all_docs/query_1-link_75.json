        "text": "As a past president of Church Women United it was a pleasure to know JoEtta. My sympathy to the family. We will be sending a Memorial gift of $25 to National Church Women United in her name.\n\nValois Wolter\n\nNovember 13, 2011\n\nMy heart felt sympathy goes out to you the family at the passing of your loved one,My Mother Collins. Know she is truly Home and free.She became my friend in sunday school and church at Bethel AME Church in Cedar Rapids while I resided there in 2010.My care for her grew as I listen to her in sunday school class.May God's Peace, Grace and Mercy surround and keep you all. Marian Armstrong\n\nMarian D, ArmstrongINSERT INTO guestbook VALUES (Edwards)\n\nNovember 13, 2011\n\nMrs. Joetta Collins continues to be the classest most gracious woman I ever meet. She was my first introduction to the bible and my continued walk in the christian faith. She is the perfect example of love, kindness and patience. My fondest memory is at 5yrs old she told our sunday school class the Christmas Story on a felt board. Afterwards she explained why one must never write X-Mas instead of Christmas because you cut out 'Christ' whom is the reason we have Christmas at all. She will be truly missed but always cherished in my heart. May God wash the Collins family with warm and wonderful memories of this wonderful lady.\n\nSuzette Howard-Gadegbeku\n\nNovember 13, 2011\n\nWhen we moved here in 1962 we were greeted by a warm, welcoming, helpful community. JoEtta was one of the most kind, positive ladies that we met.\n\nThank you JoEtta.\n\nClara Hardiman INSERT INTO guestbook VALUES (Pixie)\n\nNovember 14, 2011\n\nMrs. Joetta Collins was a \"Christian Lady\" in every sense of the word. She was a woman of class and grace. I am blessed for having known her. She was an encourager and a supporter to my husband , Rev. John Blackmon,myself and my daughter, Kimberly in our ministries. She is absent from the body, but surely present with the Lord whom she loved and served with her whole heart. Her presence will be sorely missed in the community and especially at Bethel AME Church, where I met her and last saw her in November of 2010.\n\nJoan W. Blackmon\n\nNovember 14, 2011\n\nMy thoughs and Prayers go out to you...JoEtta and I went to the same church..She was loved by many and will be missed by all..May the Lord put his arms around you in this time of grief,and know that this wonderful lady is By His side.\n\nBrother Larry Dobbins\n\nNovember 14, 2011\n\nMontyne,\n\nI am so sorry for the loss of your grandmother. It has been a tough year for you, but be strong and have faith. You are forever in my thoughts and my prayers!! Luv ya girl!\n\nTersa Cassady\n\nNovember 15, 2011\n\nTo the Collins Family,\n\nMrs. Collins was for many a living example of how to be a Woman of God. Mrs. Collins was the love of many at home and at church. She was a mentor to those whom she came in contact with. We are better because she spent time with us.\n\nAs we lift your family up in prayer and remembrance of Mrs. Collins, please accept our prayers also for each and every one of you.\n\nThe Raydell Brooks Family\n\nLiz Brooks\n\nNovember 16, 2011\n\nI WENT TO GRADE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL WITH JOETTA. JOETTA WAS ALWAYS A FINE PERSON AND I AM SURE SHE WILL BE MISSED BY ALL WHO KNEW HER.\n\nBEN CORZINE\n\nJanuary 19, 2012"
