D. C. January 6, 1943 MEMORANDUM F04 COLONEL DONOVAN: The French General Staff in peace times contains a section known as the Second Bureau, which is the information section. A subdivision of that section is known as the \"Research Section,\" The \"Research Section\" carries out all clandestine activities, in other words, operates a secret service. At the outbreak of war the \"Research Section\" becomes the Fifth Bureau and is commanded by a Staff Officer. It operates in war time completely separated from the Second Bureau, the latter continuing its functions of collection of information through attaches and other legitimate means. With the collapse of France in 1940 the personnel of the Fifth Bweau severed itself from the Army and set up a secret service of its own under the former com- mander of the Fifth Bureau. This commander has expressed the sentiment that as far as he and his men are concerned the war is not over and will not be over until the last German has left French territory. 01-64 There e in Washington a representative of this SECRET Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/07/31: CIA-RDP13X000n1 Rnnn-inrywIrw14 � It u ss � sleitos% Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/07/31 : CIA-RDP13X00001R000100300001-0 71177.;:6:i�..c;! � � (+. bidden Fifth Bureau. He is a Fronoh professional Army officer, a mein of character and integrity, who will obey implicitly the orders of his former and present oommander. This representative was established in Washington and, under direct inetruetiona from his chief in Frame, established connection with the American Army, speeifi- cally G-2, From time to time this representative fur- nished information to Colonel Donovan's representative, which was in turn paesed on to G-2 and officers of the latter establiehment have often expressed their appre- ciation of the information furnished. I append herewith a copy of a report as an example of the type of material furniuhod. On the breach of reintione with Vichy the military personnel of the French Embansy waa interned at Hershey and the Frenchman in question accompanied his eolleagues in this internment. It had been the intention of the OSS eventually to bring about the release of the French- man, to endeavor to reestablish his contact with France, and to utilize his services either in the United Stutaa or in North Africa to maintain this contact. Paren- thetically, lb is believed that if this contact could be reeetablished it would be much more unique and valuable now than it was before the ocoupstion of the whole) of France. 1ZI: misms=ammemill111111112g11 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/07/31 : CIA-RDP13X00001R000100300001-0 MEN Declassifiecland48.k.ggTed For Release 2013/07/31 : 4-4 _CIA-RDP13X00001 f 11 ' � ';'.1!

Continued contact with France is considered desirable. however, it is not believed wise to allow any officer of the French Embassy to send noded messages from this country which have not been censored. The Assistant Chief of Stall', G-2 has been directed to obtain the cipher code mentioned and deliver it to ycu. It is desired that this code be retained by you, and that arrangements be made that will permit any messaL;e this officer desires to send to be encoded by you prior to transmittal.

(It should be said that he is a high-class man, that we do not pay him tor this work, and that he has assumed it as his patriotic duty). As a result of the Africau operations he has been completely cut off from telegraphic communications, and if we desire to con- tinue the exchange, the following steps are necessari: 1. He must regain possession of his cipher codes which are in the Embassy Chancery, now blocked off from all access by agents of the F.B.I. 2. Our assistance is necessary to arrange that a telegram from him be forwarded thrown our representative in Lisbon or in Madrid to the French Military Attache in Lisbon or Madrid, ti. � Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/07/31 : CIA-RDP13X00001R000100300001-0 II � - i'v�� �1.,�101�5 6( OMMOIMMEMMEMM\\ Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/07/31 .;Iiiii;pli.E244),W41017101;i1001041601011i0 \" Bri adior-General Deane, 020 rli November 10 1942 who will in tura send it on to the Deuxieme Bureaus In this telegram he will inquire whether his chief desires and is able to colltinue the exchange of messages, and in the event of an affirmative, whether he desires to arrange for the exchange of telegrams via Switzerland, Since a reply will come via Switzerland, we will have to advise Dulles, our man in Switzerland, that an emissary from the Chief of the Cinquieme Bureau will approach hirn. bringing a cipher message, and we must oaution Dulles to take proper security measures In transmitting the quoted message through the Legation in Bern, I suggest that if it is desired to proceed with this plan it might be possible to arrange with the LILL to escort him to the Chancery at night, quietly, so that neither the public nor other members of his Embassy need be aware of the action taken* It must be remembered that neit4ur the AMbassador nor any member of hit staff has any knowledge of these activities* And, finally, if we want to accomplish these arrangements, the quicker the bettor, since there ia reason, of course, to believe that the Germans will be increasingly active in the unoccupied area of France* If you agree with this procedure, I would sdpreoiate your advising me so that we can acts tUncerely, J.

Our assistance is necessary to arrange that a telegram from him be forwarded through our repre- sentative in Lisbon or in Madrid to the French Military Attache in Lisbon or Madrid, who will in turn send it on to the Deuxieme Bureau. In this telegram he will inquire whether his chief desires and is able to continue the exchange of messages, and in the event of an affirmative, whether he desires to arrange for the exchange of telegrams via Switzerland. 3. Since a reply will come via SwitzErland, we will have to advise Dullejthat an emissary from the Chief of the Cinquieme BUfeau will approach him, bringing a cipher message, and we must caution Dulles to take proper security measures in transmitting the quoted message through the Legation in Bern. I suggest that if it is desired to proceed with this plan it might be possible to arrange with the F.B.I. to es- cort him to the Chancery at night, quietly, so that neither the public nor other members of his Embassy need be aware of the action taken. It must be remembered that neither the Ambassador nor any member of his staff has any knowledge of these k%ctivities. And, finally, if we want to accomplish these arrangements, the quicker the better, since there is reason, of course, to believe th,t the Germans will be in- creasingly active in the unoccupied area of France.

It is believed that there is considerable misgiving in oertain quarters in Japan about the eventual results of the expansionist polioy, and of the Axis partnership. Is this really so - if so, is the feeling shared by the ordinary man in the street? It is unlikely that there is at the moment any organised opposition to the Government's polioy, but if suoh an opposition were to arise at a later date, from what group or groups would it oome? Can you make any forecast of what their main talking points' would be? We are always interested in estimates of the eoonomio position in Japan - e.g., data on the general state of business, especially internal business, the raw material position, (oupocially In oil) and the effect of Allied restrictions on Japanese life. Presumably the tendency in official propaganda is to blame shortages on to Allied restrictions. Is this so and, if sot is the arEument Kenerally aooepted? How best, in your opinion, could suoh statements be combated? tm. It is not dasirod to burden you with specialist Military questions, but you may be able to aoquira information on the following valuable pointsa (a) The effect of service expansion on the mr,n-eower situation. Do manufacturers complain of shortage of labour - if so, in what diatriots and in what industries? (b) Do shippers complain of lank of shipoing fanilities?

TOP SECRET GENERAL HEADQUARTERS SOUTHWEST PACIFIC AREA MEMORANDUM TO: General Donovan. yvi / e 16 April 1944 /czcV,e' 1. Japanese Position a. General. For the Pacific War Japan poseessed a balanced uirp�naa7�and sea force. Against light opposition she quickly advancod to INDIA, to the N.E.I., and was finally stopped in the Solomons and New Guinea. Today, however, Japan's eir, land, and Flea farces are no longer balanced. b. Air. (1) From an effective striking force the strength of tEti\" enemy air arm has dwindled until it had to assume the defensive. In this theater, even though air combat has boon greatly restricted, the onomy has boon unable to replace aircraft losses. In the BISMARCKS his air has practically ceased to exist. In NEW GUINEA few aircraft are stationed oast of HUMBOLDT BAY. (2) During the last four months estimated 1 enemy air stronFth in this theaterhaa decreased 30%. For March .� the enemy allocated 200 aircraft replacements to the Southeast Asiatic Theater, 135 to this Theater, 356 to the Central Pacific Area. Those a] locutions probably are the maximum possible with- in the month. During April, action of our Pacific Forces against enemy air has bven dovastatinr. There 13 reason to be therefore, tht the enemy air position in this Theater will con- tinuo to deteric,rate. AggresJi'!e air action in preparation for and durInu the HOLLANDIA Operation will either dostroy the enemy Or rorce which engages us or force Its withlrawal.

The intelleotual and salaried classes, who have suffered the most heavily from inflation, are in danger of liquidation. The academic groups suffer not only the attrition and demoralization of economic stress, the weight of years of political control and repression is robbing them of the intellectual vigor and, leaaership they once had. 5. Peasant resentment of the Abuses of conscription, tax collection ana other arbitrary impositions has been, widespread and, is growing. The danger is ever. increasing that past sporadic outbreaks of banditry and. agrarian unrest mm, increase in scale and find, political motivation. 6. The provincial qxoups are making ODIUM= cause with one another and with other dissident groups, and are actively consolidating their positions. Their continuing strength in the face of the growing weakness of the Central governm mont is forcing new meRsures of political appeasement in their favor. 7. Mrestiwithin the 'Kuomintang armies is increasing, as Shown in one important instance by the \"Young Generals conspiracy\" late in 1943. On a higher Plane the war zone commodore are building up their own spheres of influence and are thue creating a new warlordise. S. The break between the Kuomintang and the Oorsmuninte not only shows no signs of being closed, but grows more critical with the passage of time: the inevitar. Idlity of civil war is now generally accepted. 9. The Kuomintang is losing the respect and support of the people by its selfish policies and �Lte refusal to heed progressive criticism. It seem unable to revivify itself with fresh blood., and. its unchanging leadership shows a growing ossification and loan of a sense of reality. To combat the dissensions and cliquiem withiL the Party, which grow more rather than lees acute, the leadarehip is turning toward the reactionary and unpopular Ohen brothers clique. 10. The Generalineimo shows a similar lone of realistic flexibility and a hardening of narrowly conservative views. His groNing meglomania and his unfortunate attempts to be \"sage\" an well as leader -- shown, for instance by \"Ohinals Destite and his book on economics have forfeited the respea of map, intellectuals, who enjoy in China a position of unique influence. 0 idol= of his dictatorship is becoming more outspoken. These umptons of deterioration and internal stress have been increastd by the defeat in Honan and will be farther accelerated if, as seems Moly, the Japanene succeed in partially or wholly depriving the Central Government of East China south of the Yangtze.

It does nothing to stop large-scale Drofiteerin, hoarding end epeca. lation .. all of which are carried on by people either powerful in the Party or with intimate political connectione. It fails to carry out effective mobilization of resources. Suoh meneures of wartime control as it has promulgated have remained a deaa letter or have intensified the problems they were eappoeelly designed to rernedy.as for. instance 111.eavieed and poorly axeclated attempts at price regulation. It passively allows both industrial and the more important handicraft pro. duotion to run down, 813 they of course maet when it is more Profitable for spemaltors to hold raw materials than to have them go through the normal pro- ductive process. It fails to carry out rationing except in a very limited way, or to ragu. late the manufacture and trade in luxury ecods, many of which come from areas under Japanese control. It shows little concern thc..t these imports are largely paid for with strategic commodities of value to the enemy. It faile to make an effective attempt to reduce the budgetary deficit and increase revenue by tapping suchresources as excess profits and inQomes of land- lords and merchants. It allows its tax-collecting apparatus to hog down in cor- ruption and inefficiency -- to the point that possibly not more than one-third of revenues collected reach the government. It continues to sPend huge govern- meat funds on an Me and useless Party bureaucracy. At best, it passively watches inflation gather momentum without even attemvt- ins; palliative measures available to it, such as the aggressive sale of gold and foreign .7.urrency.
