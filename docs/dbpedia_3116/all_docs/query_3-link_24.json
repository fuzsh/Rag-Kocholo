        "text": "The reason to write again on Jan Montyn is because recently i added to my inventory the ultimate book on Montyn his prints. This book is now available at www.ftn-books.com\n\nMy first-ever encounter with the works of Jan Montyn was in the early seventies. It was then that I acquired my very own beautiful etching by the renowned artist – a mesmerizing depiction of a blue bird, set against a typical Montyn background. The artwork was relatively large in size, and I proudly displayed it on my wall for over ten years before replacing it with a photograph by Lucien Clergue.\n\nDespite being in a drawer for the past three decades, my fondness for this etching has not diminished. This holds true for all other Montyn etchings I have come across. They possess a dreamlike quality that effortlessly blends realism with abstract elements, all executed with impeccable technique.\n\nIt wasn’t until years after acquiring the etching that I stumbled upon Jan Montyn’s autobiography, which shed light on his early years. The artist had an eventful life, spending time in the Foreign Legion, surviving a shipwreck as a sailor in the Kriegsmarine, and even fighting in the Eastern Front near Koerlandand. He was a colorful character who may not have always made the best political choices, but his art continues to stand out and deserves to be admired without bias.\n\nFor an excellent read on the artist’s life and work, I recommend the title published on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 1999, available at http://www.ftn-books.com. Embrace the enigmatic complexity and linguistic dynamism of Montyn’s art, and revel in the unique vocabulary he employs to bring his visions to life. Trust me, it’s worth it.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI never had seen a Montyn work until the early ~Seventies. At that timne i bought my first Jan Montyn etching. A blue bird, simplified on a typical Montyn background. It was a fairly large etching and i had it on the wall for over 10 years and then i changed it for a photograph of Lucien Clergue. It is in a drawer for 3 decades now, but i still like it . It is the same with all other Montyn etchings. They have something dreamlike and combine realism with abstract parts and all have great technique. Some years after i bought this etching i read the autobiography of Jan Montyn in which he tells the story of his early life. Specially the days he spent in the Foreign Legion, was shipwrecked as a sailor for the Kriegsmarine and was sent to the Eastern Front near Koerlandand and particpated in the battles over there. A colorfull figure, who perhaps did not always make the right (political) choices in his life, but his art still stands out and deserves to be appreciated apart from these. An excelllent title , published on the occasion of 75th birthday in 1999 is available at www.ftn-books.com\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
