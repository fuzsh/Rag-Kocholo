        "text": "Is Martha Stewart now selling show music by the yard at K-mart, in a do-it-yourself booth hard by the flatware display and the potted plants? So one might conclude after a visit to “Summer of ’42,” a personality-free new musical with a book by Hunter Foster and music and lyrics by David Kirshenbaum. Sweet, earnest, inoffensive and entirely forgettable, the show might be compared to one of those seascapes in oils sold by the bushel at art fairs, the kind that fill wall space in rented beach houses and are never noticed.\n\nNot much notice is likely to be taken of “Summer of ’42,” and indeed it’s hard to imagine who the audience for the show was expected to be. Adapted from Herman Raucher’s novel and his screenplay for the popular 1971 movie (“PG — originally rated R,” informs a telling footnote in my Leonard Maltin), the musical is peopled primarily by randy teenagers. Its point of view is accordingly adolescent — but adolescent circa 1942, meaning today’s youth, bred on “American Pie” and MTV, would be mystified by its characters’ awed, quaintly sniggering attitude to sex. “Summer of ’42” offers further depressing proof that artists and producers drawn to musical theater often are hopelessly out of touch with contemporary sensibilities, cocooned as they are in a world that dawned with Richard Rodgers and stopped dead at Stephen Sondheim.\n\nWhich is not to suggest that Kirshenbaum’s score is worthy of comparison with those masters, of course. His music is not unattractive and not incompetent, but it’s easier to suggest what it isn’t than what it is. Mostly it’s just there: Percolating along happily, wistfully, roguishly, ardently, constantly, but adding little in the way of flavor to the show, and yoked to similarly by-the-numbers lyrics (“Is it wrong/If I long to know the splendor/Of complete surrender/In love’s eternal flame”). We seem to be hearing variations on the same two or three pleasant songs for much of the evening (titles like “The Walk,” “The Heat,” “The Movies” and “The Drugstore” alternate with the almost equally generic “Will That Ever Happen to Me?,” “Promise of the Morning” and “Someone to Dance With Me”).\n\nThe book by Foster (an actor currently starring as Bobby Strong in “Urinetown”) is also efficient and functional, but its teenage humor (“Hermie’s a homo!”) grows wearisome quickly. Hermie, as fans of the picture may recall, is the central character, a boy on the verge of manhood who becomes infatuated with — and is ultimately deflowered by — an older woman whose soldier husband is at war.\n\nHe is played by newcomer Ryan Driscoll, a recent high school grad whose sweetly bleating voice and innocent face are convincingly adolescent. He gives an able performance, but is required to wear an awkward grimace for so long you want to pipe up and tell him that if he’s not careful his face might get stuck that way. (That gag is of the same vintage as the show’s overall comic tone.)\n\nKate Jennings Grant is the object of his worship, Dorothy, and she has an attractive, silvery voice and gives the character a slight air of remoteness that works well. The relationship between these two doesn’t come close to suggesting the kind of brief but life-changing bond it is supposed to, however.\n\nThe rest of the small cast is around almost exclusively for comic relief, although there’s not much going on that we feel any urgent need to be relieved from. The niftiest part of the show, to continue the oil-painting metaphor, is its amusingly embellished frame. The trio of young girls chased by Hermie and his pals — nicely played by Celia Keenan-Bolger, Megan Valerie Walker and Erin Webley — double as a sort of Andrews Sisters chorus, punctuating the musical with brief pastiche songs in ’40s styles.\n\nThese tunes have more distinction than Kirshenbaum’s book songs, certainly, and even the set by James Youmans, which prettily cues the show’s beach-town setting, livens up when the girls are around. These are the only occasions when director Gabriel Barre’s minimal choreography asserts itself, too, and even Walter Winchell joins the party, offering some amusingly conceived war dispatches.\n\nBut then it’s back to the boys’ goofy horseplay and the budding romance and the gently lapping sounds of Kirshenbaum’s score, as songs pile up like so much driftwood on the sand."
