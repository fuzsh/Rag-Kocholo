For three teenage boys spending a lonely summer on the beach in New England, it was the summer they learned about life, the summer they became men, the Summer of '42. World War II. Fifteen-year-old, sensitive Hermie (Gary Grimes) and his friends Oscy (Jerry Houser) and Benjie (Oliver Conant), the \"terrible trio,\" spend the long summer days dreaming of and ogling girls. But Hermie has his eye on an older woman, 22-year-old, married Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill). Dorothy's husband is overseas in the military, and, lonely, she strikes up a friendship with Hermie. It's entirely innocent; Dorothy does not think of Hermie in a sexual way ... until the day she receives a telegram that her husband has been killed, and in her grief, Dorothy turns to Hermie in this tender coming-of-age story.",

        "text": "Summer of '42 is one of those rare films yon can't help liking simply for its aspirations which are so honest and open-minded.\n\nJune 2, 2020\n\nThanks to director Robert Mulligan and a largely unfamiliar cast it turns cut to be a delightful film.\n\nJune 2, 2020\n\nPeople who actually recall 1942 will more greatly appreciate the waves of nostalgia that bathe this affectionate coming-of-age drama, set on a tiny island off New England.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nSummer of '42 has a large amount of charm and tenderness; it also has little dramatic economy and much eye-exhausting photography which translates to forced and artificial emphasis on a strungout story.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nIn the early hijinks phase, the film seems like a dry run for Porky's, but it later gets into the business of fluttering curtains, walks on sandy beaches and longing glances.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nIt forever misses, unlike American Graffiti, the heady sexual climate of adolescence to concentrate on the circumstances of the sex act itself.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
