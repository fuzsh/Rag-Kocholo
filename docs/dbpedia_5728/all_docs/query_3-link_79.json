        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThis new musical explores the exhilaration and pain of first love. Hermie (age 15) and his friends spend the summer of 1942 together on a New England island, where Hermie meets Dorothy, a young bride whose husband has been shipped off to serve in the war. Although he tries to ignore his feelings for her by dating other girls, Hermie falls for Dorothy, a love she cannot return. However, when Dorothy’s husband is killed in battle, she fills the void briefly with Hermie’s affection. By summer’s end, however, they all must go their own way, and Hermie’s first love becomes nothing but a memory."
