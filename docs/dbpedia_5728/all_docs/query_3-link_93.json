        "text": "Mortgage Rates Remain at the Lowest Level in Over a Year\n\nAugust 15, 2024\n\nWhile rates increased slightly this week, they remain more than half a percent lower than the same time last year. In 2023, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage nearly hit 8 percent, slamming the brakes on the housing market. Now, the 30-year fixed-rate hovers around 6.5 percent and will likely trend down in the coming months as inflation continues to slow. Lower rates are good news for potential buyers and sellers alike."
