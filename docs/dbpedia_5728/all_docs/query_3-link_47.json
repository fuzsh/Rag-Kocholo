        "text": "He was slowing down, the story wasn't as fresh, but he was still the Duke, starring in 1973's \"Cahill U.S. Marshal.\" I must confess that I started to lose my interest in the films of John Wayne by the mid-60s. I loved \"The Sons of Katie Elder,\" tolerated the odd \"Hellfighters,\" only saw \"True Grit\" once, and then it kind of stopped. So stumbling across \"Cahill,\" the other day, I decided to check it out. Wayne is still very present as the U.S. Marshal who has ignored his two sons - Danny (\"Summer of 42's\" Gary Grimes) and Billy Joe (Clay O'Brien) while pursuing various criminals. And what do boys do when dad isn't around? They decide to help George Kennedy's band rob the local bank (this was way before after-school programs, I guess). Under Andrew McLaglen's capable direction, the movie zips along and the boys are the best thing in it. Neither Grimes nor O'Brien went very far in the movies, but they give great performances here. And the cast is full of colorful character actors such as Kennedy, Neville Brand (here, playing a Native American), Jackie Coogan, and many veterans of the John Ford acting troupe - Harry Carey Jr., Hank Worden, Paul Fix, Denver Pyle. McLaglen, as you recall, was the son of acting legend Victor McLaglen who co-starred alongside the Duke in two of Ford's cavalry films, as well as \"The Quiet Man.\" And then there's the Duke himself, still very capable of taking out the bad guys with a clear head, a keen shot, and an appropriate quip. Adding a great deal of atmosphere is Elmer Bernstein's score, which really boosts this minor entry in the Duke filmography. Check it out and keep your eyes on the kids - they steal this film from one of America's cinema legends. Stay safe."
