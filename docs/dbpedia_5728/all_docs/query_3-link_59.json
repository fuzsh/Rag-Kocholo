        "text": "Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet\n\nBy Jamie Ford,\n\nFrom my list on books that take place at a hotel.\n\nBy Tanya E. Williams Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve admired old buildings, hotels in particular, for many years. When immersed in a historic building, I find myself leaning in to discover what the walls might tell me if only I could listen closely enough. When I began writing The Hotel Hamilton series, I scoured the archives for historic hotels, learning how they came to be and how they've evolved through the years. One of the most fascinating aspects of hotel life for me is the juxtaposition of experiences felt by the guests versus those of the hotel staff. The upstairs/downstairs vibe of hotel life is ripe for creating tension within a novel, and that always intrigues me.\n\nTanya's book list on books that take place at a hotel\n\nWhy did Tanya love this book?\n\nThis deeply moving story took hold of my heart and didn’t let it go. Even years after having read this novel, I am still moved by the thought of it.\n\nStruggle, war, injustice, and young love are carefully woven together in a gripping tale that speaks of truths and heartbreak we seldom examine. I can’t recommend Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet enough as it is as moving as it is important.\n\nBy Jamie Ford,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n1986, The Panama Hotel The old Seattle landmark has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has made a startling discovery in the basement: personal belongings stored away by Japanese families sent to interment camps during the Second World War. Among the fascinated crowd gathering outside the hotel, stands Henry Lee, and, as the owner unfurls a distinctive parasol, he is flooded by memories of his childhood. He wonders if by some miracle, in amongst the boxes of dusty treasures, lies a link to the Okabe family, and the girl he lost his young heart to, so…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Power of One\n\nBy Bryce Courtenay,\n\nFrom my list on impossible odds and satisfying endings.\n\nBy Jill Wallace Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy ultimate read is when the action is fast, but the character's discovery of self is slow. Besides, being engrossed in the challenges of others makes my own pale by comparison. The author needs to get me to empathize with the characters - even if their struggles are nothing like my own - and once they’ve done that, I’ll be in for the long haul! Journeying through life’s mire and finding the rainbow with a character you believe - and believe in - makes for the ultimate in vicarious living. And ‘Heck, YES’ to a satisfying ending!\n\nJill's book list on impossible odds and satisfying endings\n\nWhy did Jill love this book?\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book because it’s set in South Africa and has all the elements that move me as a human being: pain, pleasure, violence, mysticism, and adventure. There was also enough drama to keep my nose immersed in this book for hours on end. To say I loved Peekay is an understatement. It takes a hellofa writer to make me feel.\n\nI ached for Peekay, was excited for him, humiliated for him, thrilled for him, and proud of him. I felt Peekay. I agree wholeheartedly with a literary critic who said of this book: “Unabashedly uplifting…asserts forcefully what all of us would like to believe: that the individual, armed with the spirit of independence–‘the power of one’ can prevail.”\n\nBy Bryce Courtenay,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked The Power of One as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

Johns Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs I’ve reached middle age, I’ve found that many books about this period are about trying to regain lost youth or the hardships that aging can bring. I want to read more books about women who have lived through some things and are more powerful (and funnier!) because of it. In my writing, I try to highlight the stories of women with a little bit of history behind them and show that a long life–if we’re lucky–is also a full one. I hope you enjoy the books on this list as much as I have!\n\nSarah's book list on middle age readers that aren’t depressing\n\nWhy did Sarah love this book?\n\nThis isn’t a book about middle age as much as it is a book about a middle-aged woman. Margery Benson, schoolteacher and spinster, has been overlooked and overworked. She’s ready for an adventure and to find the beetle she’s been obsessed with since childhood.\n\nMargery doesn’t go on this adventure alone, and the friendship between Margery and the younger, flashier Enid Pretty is the real heart of this novel. Adventure, friendship, women finding their strength: it’s exactly what I want from a book.\n\nBy Rachel Joyce,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked Miss Benson's Beetle as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWINNER OF THE WILBUR SMITH ADVENTURE WRITING PRIZE | BEST PUBLISHED NOVEL\n\nWOMAN & HOME BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR and A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\n'The perfect escape novel for our troubled times.'

As a fiction writer, my narrative tools are not forged in a vacuum. I stand on the shoulders of centuries of writers who invented the novel form and developed it through its beginnings in romance and all its permutations since. In my new book, I am following innovations in two genres. In historical romance, romance “fell” into history. What was lost in the historical world could be made up in the romance of heroic characters. In the picaresque, characters belonging to the lower echelons of society “go on the road” for all sorts of reasons, mostly to survive.\n\nCinda's book list on going on the road\n\nWhy did Cinda love this book?\n\nThis story has a Huck Finn flavour to it, recast on a 1950s road trip by bus.\n\nOrphan Donal goes from the frying pan into the fire when his grandmother, his guardian, gets sick, and he is farmed out to a nasty-tempered relative he has never met.\n\nAfter all the talk of Donal having no family, his salvation comes first from Herman, a non-relative who helps him escape back onto the bus that brought him there. The two light out for the West and cobble together what will feel like family in a ragtag bunch of misfits.\n\nBy Ivan Doig,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Last Bus to Wisdom as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNamed a Best Book of the Year by the Seattle Times and Kirkus Review\n\nThe final novel from a great American storyteller.\n\nDonal Cameron is being raised by his grandmother, the cook at the legendary Double W ranch in Ivan Doig’s beloved Two Medicine Country of the Montana Rockies, a landscape that gives full rein to an eleven-year-old’s imagination. But when Gram has to have surgery for “female trouble” in the summer of 1951, all she can think to do is to ship Donal off to her sister in faraway Manitowoc, Wisconsin. There Donal is in for a rude surprise:…\n\nPreview\n\nWait\n\nBy Gabriella Burnham,\n\nFrom my list on books that feel like Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer”.\n\nBy John Glynn Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nHi! I'm John Glynn, and I'm excited to share some book recommendations inspired by one of my favorite Taylor Swift songs, \"Cruel Summer.\" To me, this song perfectly encapsulates the heightened emotions of summer love—a theme at the heart of my memoir Out East. I chose books that capture the \"fever dream highs\" of the season. But at the same time, as Taylor sings, \"Summer's a knife,\" filled with longing and heartache, primed for nostalgia. All of these books carry the kind of moonlit shimmer I crave in a smart beach read. As a Swiftie, a beach lover, an avid reader, and a hopeless romantic, I hope you enjoy.\n\nJohn's book list on books that feel like Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer”\n\nWhy did John love this book?\n\nThis book comes out in May, and I devoured an advance copy in two awestruck sittings.\n\nI was completely bowled over by the gorgeously evocative, lyrically taut writing. But the characters—two sisters from working-class Nantucket who are grappling with their mother’s deportation to Brazil—felt knowable, original, and unforgettable.\n\nThe summer they spend in this book is quite literally a cruel one as they grapple with their family’s separation.

Brill takes artistic license with Mitchell’s story, adding nuance and detail likely outside the scope of her research, and delivers a riveting tale of a woman determined to live her dreams, no matter how high the barriers to achieving them.\n\nBy Amy Brill,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Movement of Stars as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAmy Brill's The Movement of Stars tells a story of illicit love and extraordinary ambition.\n\nIt is 1845, and Hannah Gardner Price dreams of a world infinitely larger than the small Quaker community where she has lived all 25 years of her life - for, as an amateur astronomer, she secretly hopes to discover a comet and win the King of Denmark's prize for doing so.\n\nBut she can only indulge her passion for astronomy as long as the men in her life - her father, brother and family friends - are prepared to support it, and so she treads…\n\nPreview\n\nAhab's Wife\n\nBy Sena Jeter Naslund,\n\nWhy did Beth love this book?\n\nThis book inspired my own writing with its detailed rendering of 19th century life.
