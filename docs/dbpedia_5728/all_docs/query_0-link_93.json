        "text": "The smash world premiere staging of the musical, Summer of '42, at the Norma Terris Theatre/Goodspeed-at-Chester in Connecticut, will transfer to the Victoria Theatre in Dayton, OH, Oct. 10-22.\n\nGoodspeed Musicals' executive director Michael P. Price made the announcement Aug. 30.\n\nAudiences are eating up and selling out the eight-actor stage musical version of the coming-of-age movie, which has songs by David Kirshenbaum and book by Hunter Foster. Goodspeed is producing the transfer with the set and cast -- including Idina Menzel -- intact (although the scenic elements will be augmented). Gabriel Barre directs.\n\nThe Ohio booking will be the first time the show faces critics. As a developmental space, Goodspeed-at-Chester has a gentleman's agreement with critics and the works-in-progress there are not reviewed, despite a tendency toward sold-out houses and star names.\n\nConceivably, other regional presenters could attend the Dayton booking and express interest in bookings in their markets. Observers have suggested the warm, humorous, bittersweet musical could have a huge life regionally, the same way Nunsense, Quilters, Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up?, Over the Tavern, The Foreigner, The Nerd, The Immigrant and other works became mini-industries. The Ohio move was arranged with Dione Kennedy, managing director of the Victoria, a 1,100-seat touring house in Dayton. Kennedy came to Chester, CT, for the current developmental run of the show at Goodspeed's intimate, 200-seat Norma Terris Theatre, and thought her audience would embrace it.\n\nOther producers such as Barry and Fran Weissler, Edgar Dobie and Tom and Jack Viertel have also come to sample the sentimental crowd-pleaser, about a 15-year-old boy's summer adventures with his pals on an island in Maine during the summer of 1942. Young Hermie's encounter with a needy war bride is the emotional core of the film and musical. Menzel plays Dorothy and newcomer Ryan Driscoll (making his professional debut) is Hermie.\n\nSummer of '42 began Aug. 10 and continues to Sept. 10 at the Norma Terris. It was originally announced to close Sept. 3, but audience interest prompted the extension.\n\nGoodspeed technicians are investigating how the scenic elements of the show (lighting by Timothy Hunter and set by James Youmans) might be expanded for the larger Ohio space. Pamela Scofield is costume designer and Lynne Shankel is musical director.\n\nThe cast also includes Brett Tabisel, a Tony Award nominee for Big, as Hermie's pal, Oscy; Jason Marcus as Benjie; Matt Farnsworth as Pete; Jeanne Goodman as Gloria; Celia Keenan-Bolger as Aggie; Bill Kux as Walter Winchell/Mr. Sanders; Megan Walker as Miriam.\n\n*\n\nHunter Foster, the New York actor who has appeared in the recent Grease! revival and Footloose, penned the libretto, and Kirshenbaum is composer lyricist.\n\nMenzel, a Tony Award nominee for Rent, played Kate in Barre's spring 2000 staging of Andrew Lippa's The Wild Party at Manhattan Theatre Club.\n\nManhattan and regional readings of the new musical preceded the Goodspeed developmental staging, which is a full production minus the pressure of reviewers.\n\nSummer of '42 is the musicalization of the 1971 film (and novel by Herman Raucher) about a teenager's coming-of age with a war widow on an East Coast island. Actor Driscoll is a high school senior from Deep River, CT. The tuner had readings in New York City and Ann Arbor, MI, in 1999.\n\nComposer-lyricist Kirshenbaum may be best known for Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus. He won a Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation Award for Summer of '42. He was cabaret director at Williamstown Theatre Festival has musical-directed at York Theatre Company in Manhattan.\n\n*\n\nThough critics were lukewarm, Robert Mulligan's 1971 film, \"Summer of '42,\" became a big box office draw, with new star Jennifer O'Neill and composer Michel LeGrand receiving special attention. The story told of a 15-year-old boy, Hermie, drawn into a relationship with Dorothy, a beautiful war-bride.\n\nNick Corley staged previous readings of Summer of '42.\n\nSongs in the show have included \"Someone To Dance With Me,\" \"Will That Ever Happen To Me?\" and the solo for Dorothy, \"Losing Track of Time\" (which has been recorded).\n\nAsked about how Summer came into fruition, composer-lyricist Kirshenbaum told Playbill On-Line in 1999: \"It was Hunter Foster's idea, and we've been working on it just over a year in earnest. He and I went to the University of Michigan together. In fact, he had a lead role in the first musical I ever wrote. Anyway, he had the idea, and I said, `if you can get the rights to it, go ahead,' figuring these things are impossibly complicated. Hunter's lawyer approached [screenwriter] Herman Raucher's lawyers, and in a month we had the rights. We started working on it February of last year and held a private reading for ourselves in March.\"\n\nAsked what he felt was special about the material, Kirshenbaum said, \"It's a memory play. People remember the movie's nostalgic element, the relationship between Dorothy and Hermie, but I think the piece is more about loss. It's very touching. Through this first love of his life, Hermie goes through every kind of emotion you can experience in a relationship. Of course, it's also very funny.\"\n\n*\n\nGoodspeed tickets are $29.
