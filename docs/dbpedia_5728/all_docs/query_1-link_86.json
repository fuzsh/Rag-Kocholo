        "text": "People who actually recall 1942 will more greatly appreciate the waves of nostalgia that bathe this affectionate coming-of-age drama, set on a tiny island off New England.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jun 9, 2011\n\nSummer of '42 has a large amount of charm and tenderness; it also has little dramatic economy and much eye-exhausting photography which translates to forced and artificial emphasis on a strungout story.\n\nFull Review | Mar 26, 2009\n\nIn the early hijinks phase, the film seems like a dry run for Porky's, but it later gets into the business of fluttering curtains, walks on sandy beaches and longing glances.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 30, 2006\n\n\"Summer Of '42\" is an unforgettable meditation on sexual awakening and loss during WWII.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Aug 27, 2005\n\n\"Summer of '42\" is a memory movie, written, directed and acted with such uncommon good humor that I don't think you'll be put off by its sweet soft-focus, at least until you start analyzing it afterwards.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | May 9, 2005\n\nOne of the cinematic coming-of-age stories that started a trend.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | May 3, 2005\n\nNostalgia is used as a distancing device -- to keep us safely insulated from the boy's immediate grief, love, and passion.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Oct 23, 2004"
