        "text": "This monograph * identifies the following main historical stages in the evolution of film theory concepts in the Cinema Art journal from its inception (1931, the journal was then called Proletarian Cinema) to the present day: 1931-1955 (during the overall totalitarian period of the USSR, editors-in-chief V. Sutyrin, K. Yukov, N. Semenov, A. Mitlin, I. Pyryev, N. Lebedev, V. Grachev, D. Yeremin, V. Zhdan), 1956-1968 (thaw period, editors-in-chief V. Zhdan, V. Grachev, L. Pogozheva), 1969-1985 (stagnation period, editors-in-chief E. Surkov, A. Medvedev, Y. Cherepanov), 1986-1991 (the period of \"perestroika,\" editors-in-chief Y. Cherepanov and K. Shcherbakov), the post-Soviet period 1992-2022 (editors-in-chief K. Shcherbakov, 1992; D. Dondurey, 1993-2017; A. Dolin, 2017-2022). * Some small fragments of the monograph were written with the participation of Andrei Novikov. * Сhapter “Theoretical Concepts of Film Studies in Cinema Art Journal: XXI Century” were written with the participation of Emma Camarero. his research was supported financially by the Russian Science Foundation (project No. 22-28-00317) at Rostov State University of Economics. Project theme: \"Evolution of Theoretical Concepts of Film Studies in the Cinema Art Journal (1931-2021)\". The head of the project is film historian, Prof. Dr. A.V. Fedorov. Reviewers: Professor Marina Tselykh, Professor Valery Gura.\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, the editors of Cinema Art apparently realized that the attempts to transform the magazine into a socio-political one, made at the end of the \"perestroika\" era and in the 1990s, had not yielded the expected dividends. As a result, the journal returned to the format of a cinematic publication. Hence the increase in the number of theoretical articles on cinema, which in the 21st century averaged eighteen a year. Daniil Dondurey (1947-2017), who directed Cinema Art until 2017, maintained the journal's course towards a sociological understanding of the media process, while attracting leading authors in the field. The film critic Anton Dolin, who replaced him in the second half of 2017, on the one hand re-emphasized political accents and also strengthened passages in the journal texts that opposed the authorities, and on the other hand began to pay much more attention to the genres of mass culture in film. Our analysis of the concepts of film studies (in the context of the socio-cultural, historical, political situation, etc.) in the journal Cinema Art in the 21st century has shown that the theoretical works on cinematic topics in this period can be divided into the following types-Articles, discussions devoted to the analysis of the theoretical heritage of the classics and the history of Soviet cinema (A\n\nBased on the analysis of film studies concepts (in the context of the socio-cultural and political situation, etc.) of the first decade of the existence of the journal Cinema Art (1931–1941), the authors came to the conclusion that theoretical works on cinematographic topics during this period can be divided into the following types: - ideologized articles by Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers activists (1931–1932), emphasizing the dominance of \"truly revolutionary proletarian cinema\" and an uncompromising struggle with the views of any opponents; - ideologically reoriented articles (1932–1934), written as a positive reaction to the Resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) “On the restructuring of literary and artistic organizations” (1932), many provisions of which (in particular, a clear indication that that the framework of the proletarian literary and artistic organizations) have become a direct threat to the existence of the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers; in articles of this kind, activists of the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers — until the liquidation of this organization in early 1935 – tried to prove their necessity and loyalty to the “general line of the Communist party”; - Articles containing sharp criticism of \"groupism\" (including among the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers), \"enemies of the people\", etc. (1935–1938); - theoretical articles attacking various types of formalistic phenomena (primarily in the field of montage) in cinema and culture (1931–1941); - theoretical articles opposing empiricism, \"documentaryism\", naturalism and physiology, vulgar materialism, aestheticism, \"emotionalism\" on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideological and class approaches (1931–1941); - theoretical articles defending the principles of socialist realism in cinema (1933–1941); - theoretical articles criticizing bourgeois film theories and Western influence on Soviet cinema (1931–1941); - theoretical articles aimed primarily at professional problems of mastering sound in cinema (in particular, the dramaturgy of sound, music), editing, image, film image, film language (for example, the cinematic possibilities of the “zeit-loop” effect), cinema style, genre, entertainment, construction script (plot, composition, conflict, typology of characters, typology of comic devices, etc.), acting, etc. (1931–1941); - theoretical articles balancing between ideology and professional approaches to the creation of cinematic works of art (1931–1941)."
