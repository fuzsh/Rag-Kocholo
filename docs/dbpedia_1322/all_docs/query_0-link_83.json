        "text": "Category: CIA\n\nDavid Baldacci and the book ‘Hell’s Corner’\n\nIn returning to a five-book series by David Baldacci, available as the Camel Club series of books, the book titled Hell’s Corner looks into the distant and recent past of service, rebelliousness for the rules of an assassin’s lifestyle, the maddening proclivity of decision-makers not to share all the information with people aiming to hold the guilty accountable while stopping evil plots against those in authority and, finally, a new alliance for the star of this series with a covert agent of the British covert service Mi6.\n\nHell’s Corner follows The Camel Club, The Collectors, Stone Cold and Divine Justice, as reviewed here, here, here and here. Oliver Stone, aka the former CIA assassin David Carr, is brought back into official government service on the auspices of a request to investigate the blurred lines between the Russian mob and the Russian government muscling in on the Mexican drug trade. This focus quickly changes when Stone/Carr is present in Lafayette Park across from the White House in Washington DC when a bomb exploded. As the British Prime Minister looks like an initial target of the bombing, Mary Chapman and Carr partner to investigate the incident.\n\nThe investigation commences with much to sort through regarding clues to find and leads to chase down. Members of the Camel Club, beyond Stone/Carr, are on the outside with no direct or indirect involvement. The story moves through a good portion of the plot before this changes, first owing to members of the Camel Club and later due to circumstances for Stone/Carr with Chapman that dictate the need to rely on people without personal agendas. That the investigation for the central partnership had experienced some challenges, intriguing in their development to have gotten to the point, leads to strong plot points that fed well into the way that the larger story ultimately is resolved.\n\nThat the story struck upon plot elements of being a step or steps behind for much of the story, with the revelation for why coming so late in the storytelling, impressed me. I enjoyed Hell’s Corner as written by David Baldacci to the level of granting the experience 4.0-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, July 13, 2024\n\nMitch Rapp and the book ‘Total Power’ by Kyle Mills\n\nKyle Mills continues the Mitch Rapp series of books (book sequence here) created by Vince Flynn with the nineteenth (19th) book in the series, the sixth written by Mills. With Total Power, we see a threat to the United States power grid from ISIS (sometimes called ISIL, Daesh, or more simply, IS). The book unfolds with traditional terrorist suspense and a splash of the typical lack of political will, with a stronger bit of terrorism skill baked in.\n\nThe first movements of the story within Total Power introduce the political intrigue associated with the cost of infrastructure updates to the power grid in the United States, along with the vulnerability of the network if a knowledgeable actor with evil intent along with the proper knowledge planned to exploit what weaknesses exist in the system. The underlying issue of coordinated attacks of strategic execution could plunge the United States in darkness for well beyond days, weeks or months before an effective government or free market response could be forthcoming.\n\nThe second movements of the story bring Mitch Rapp, the force of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and a US president nearing the end of his presidential leadership to bear on an imminent attack staged at the moment the issue is under attack. The attack, though led by ISIS, actually has a bite beyond the jihadist skill to deploy the attack. Despite an explicit effort led by Rapp and a capable team of counter-terrorists, the attempt to thwart the attack is detected ahead of the CIA trap that had been laid. The attack that both infiltrated ISIS and the United States power grid, plunged the mainland into darkness that would last for weeks or months. Effectively, the United States had been crippled with no effective ability to recover.\n\nWith the skills of Mitch Rapp and his team now tactically eliminated, the investigate, infiltrate and get to the knowledgeable few became the third movement of Total Power. The world of malfunctioning infrastructure, computers and communication systems down, and starvation, death and inevitable rioting with little capacity for countering the chaos became the name of the response. The means for getting to a legitimate solution that addressed the infrastructure, and those who damaged it were the odds that needed to be addressed. Would those odds be overcome? You know it would be.\n\nThat the narrative telling of Mitch Rapp moved almost strictly into ways to address a power grid attack where powerlessness to respond was at stake was unique and appreciated. This change worked for me more at a high level, though the bigger issue that I found was that there really was only one plausible way that the solution to the problem of that powerlessness was going to be resolved. That I was in tune with how things worked out earlier in the book than I wanted to know proved disappointing. As for Total Power written by Kyle Mills, I give the book 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, March 20, 2023\n\nDenzel Washington, Christopher Walken and Dakota Fanning in the Tony Scott movie ‘Man on Fire’\n\nThe 1980 novel Man on Fire by A.J. Quinell (aka Philip Nicholson) is the basis of an action crime drama directed by Tony Scott. Man on Fire (2004), presented by Scott as based in Mexico rather than Italy like in the book, treats us to a sweet if unlikely relationship between a despondent alcoholic and a kidnapped young child.\n\nIn this movie set in 2003, the former Central Intelligence Agency paramilitary officer John Creasy visits old friend Paul Rayburn. Convinced by Rayburn to take a bodyguard position for Mexico City automaker Samuel Ramos, Creasy begins protecting Ramos’ young daughter Lupita (called Pita); the kidnapping insurance policy on Lupita Ramos required the hiring of a bodyguard. Creasy, Rayburn, Samuel Ramos and Pita were portrayed by Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony and Dakota Fanning, respectively.\n\nBurned out, guilty of his past with the CIA and consumed with a need to drink alcohol, Creasy had attempted to end his life. Saved when his gun misfires, and reminded by Rayburn that “a bullet always tells the truth,” a new lease on life renews Creasy. With new purpose in protecting Pita, reduced drinking and an interest in the Bible, Creasy bonds with Pita through the protection detail and an interest taken in the girl’s swimming.\n\nIt was following a piano lesson that the storytelling moved from establishing background truths to moving in a severe direction. Two Federal Judicial Police had taken to blocking the street whereupon Pita would be abducted. Killing attackers and sustaining critical injuries, Creasy becomes a suspect. Reporter Mariana Garcia Guerrero as portrayed by Rachel Ticotin and Federal Ministerial Police officer Miguel Manzano take exceptional steps in protecting Creasy against the allegations and concrete threats placed on his life while regaining some semblance of health. Giancarlo Giannini portrayed Manzano.\n\nThe threading of the backstory including Jordan Kalfus and Samuel Ramos, as portrayed by Mickey Rourke and Marc Anthony, respectively, mixed in well with a vengeance tale that, at some level necessary and foreseeable, from the earliest parts of the movie. The gravitas of getting to that resolution was carried through with subtlety and finesse, with the understatement of Denzel Washington‘s style in getting there serving as a redeeming quality for the film. That multiple characters stood up to do the right thing in winning the day for the film, while necessary, made for a sizable message of righteousness that felt, oddly enough, out of place for me in this film.\n\nI enjoyed this movie, with the screenplay as written by Brian Helgeland, more than might seem like I did. My score for Man on Fire as directed by Tony Scott is 3.5-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, January 10, 2024\n\nSeason Four of television series ‘Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan’\n\nA fourth and final season of Amazon Prime Original Series Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan (2018-2023) was presented to fans of the series starring John Krasinski as Dr. Jack Ryan over this past summer. Reprising characters from a series of best-selling “thrillers with detailed themes of espionage, military, science, politics and technology” (Biography.Com) written by Tom Clancy, Jack Ryan was central to many of those books while aim for the same things. Here’s our reviews of season one, season two and season three of the series, with the final 6-episode season review of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan presented as follows.\n\nThe murder of Nigeria‘s President Udo in his home opens the mysterious conditions at the heart of the story this season. Jack Ryan, having ascended to deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) alongside new acting director Elizabeth Wright, is called upon to defend what looks to the oversight committee to be CIA involvement in the death. Ryan offers this along with the promise for he and Wright, as portrayed by Betty Gabriel, to clean-up the perceived overreach and corruption within the agency. Former CIA director Thomas Miller, as portrayed by John Schwab, is immediately suspected.\n\nThe consolidated power of a drug cartel, a terrorist organization and the Central Intelligence Agency had been formed into an organization with seemingly unchecked power to function against the interests of the United States for the aims of profit-making and causing chaos through murderous and symbolic ends. James Greer, Mike November and newcomer Domingo Chavez are enlisted in the direct support of intervening against the people bent on the evil ends. Greer, November and Chavez were portrayed by Wendell Pierce, Michael Kelly and Michael Peña, respectively.\n\nChavez is added aiding the original consolidated CIA mission in Mexico when a plot connected to Chao Fah, as portrayed by Louis Ozawa, leads to Myanmar. Jack, Chavez, and November investigate a Dubrobvnik, Croatia lead while James Greer is elevated to deputy director in an effort to keep Jack’s value as an agent both in play and from tarnishing Elizabeth Wright’s congressional hearing for removing the acting tag from her role as deputy director. Okieriete Onaodowan portrayed Adebayo ‘Ade’ Osoji, a U.S.-based oil lobbyist with special knowledge of the Nigerian political climate, unfolds as a mystery for Wright to puzzle out through this season.\n\nAbbie Cornish reprises her role as Dr. Cathy Mueller, with her value to Jack through his transition with the Central Intelligence Agency something that seems to have emerged off-screen between season’s three and four. This romantic link pays off with the further relationship developed with Zeyara Lemos as portrayed by Zuleikha Robinson, whose outcome and purpose played into motives that were distinctly unromantic.\n\nI found the fourth season of this series entertaining. The point-of-view mixed the notions of heroism and mystery well without getting overly preachy on the political or social messaging. Overall, I grant season four of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan 3.5-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, November 22, 2023\n\nMitch Rapp and the book ‘Lethal Agent’ by Kyle Mills\n\nKyle Mills continues the Mitch Rapp series of books (book sequence here) created by Vince Flynn with the eighteenth (18th) book in the series, the fifth written by Mills. With Lethal Agent, we see a familiar Mitch Rapp book focusing on the man, the myth and the legend of combatting terrorism while facing corrupt politicians bent on fighting the apparatus intent on fighting it.\n\nLethal Agent cleverly plays upon two concepts in speaking to the subject matter addressed with plot points based in Iraq and Yemen. The threat placed in front on the good people of the world and the folks fighting terrorism at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was of a biological nature; using the fear of unleashing chemical warfare was a first concept of a lethal agent used in this story.\n\nThe second involved Mitch Rapp, continuing his role as a contractor for the CIA while at odds with himself and his current love interest over what his future is as a fighter of terrorism. When the odds get heavy during a United States presidential election season, the nature of the threat includes a drug trafficking pipeline from Mexico to the United States that overlaps with the biological terror storyline. The means for fighting the biological threat offers a latitude to Rapp not seen at the level presented in the Lethal Agent novel.\n\nMitch acts with explicit and lethal authority in fighting a bioterrorism theater in Mexico that is brand new; the beauty of the approach is that old style Rapp appears again. That we’ve been here and done this, for the individual reader, is either great in getting to see this again or awful for seeing this again. Invoking foreign scientists was a positive turn for Lethal Agent written by Kyle Mills, thus helping me to rate the book 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, July 22, 2023\n\nSeason Three of television series ‘Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan’\n\nA third 8-episode season of Amazon Prime Original Series Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan (2018-2023) was presented to fans of the series starring John Krasinski as Dr. Jack Ryan in December of 2022. Reprising characters from a series of best-selling “thrillers with detailed themes of espionage, military, science, politics and technology” (Biography.Com) written by Tom Clancy, Jack Ryan was central to many of those books while doing the same for this series. Here’s our reviews of season one and season two of the series.\n\nThis season invokes the threat of a nuclear conflict thanks to a secret 1969 project in what had been the U.S.S.R., otherwise called the Soviet Union. Soviet officer Luka Gocharov orders the end of project Sokol in a heinous slaughter of the scientists responsible for the project at the hands of the military. With the aid Zoya Ivanova, Jack Ryan receives a tip that the program has been resurrected under Russian guidance with the suspected object of detonating the weapon. A sophisticated attempt to build actionable intelligence takes Jack to a cargo ship where a scientist on the relaunched project is pursued with Ryan in Athens, Greece. James Cosmo portrayed Gocharov as Ana Ularu portrayed Ivanova.\n\nAs this is happening, president of Czechia Alena Kovac meets publicly with the Russian defense minister, the last of which being when the defense minister shot dead in Prague. Alexei Petrov ascends to power as the new defense minister with plans of escalating the profile of Russia back to the world power Russia had been when a prominent part in the former Soviet Union. Unknown to most of the relevant power players as the season unfolds, the father of the Czech president (Petr Kovac) is working with Petrov toward similar ends as the new defense minister. Nina Hoss, Peter Guinness and Alexej Manvelov portrayed Alena Kovac, Petr Kovac and Alexei Petrov, respectively.\n\nAt the center of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) response includes Jack seeking support from James Greer, former Chief of Station in Moscow, and Chief of Station for Rome, Italy, Elizabeth Wright. The dynamic takes an interesting trajectory over the course of the season, with power plays built interpersonally and professionally taking turns that impact the plays available to Jack Ryan in the field. Ryan reaches out to Michael November, as portrayed by Michael Kelly, introducing a separate dynamic at play between Wright and Greer. Wendell Pierce and Betty Gabriel portrayed James Greer and Elizabeth Pierce, respectively.\n\nFrom the storytelling perspective, the best thing for me with the third season of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan is that the story took what felt like a storyline distinct from the Tom Clancy books that I have read. While a nuclear device in fact was a central storyline for a major book in the Jack Ryan book, this book went in a distinct direction. I found this series entertaining, though felt echoes of the television series 24 (2001-2010) and The Bourne Series (2002-2012) of movies when watching this season. Overall, I grant season three of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan 3.5-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, July 19, 2023\n\nMartin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall in the Francis Ford Coppola movie ‘Apocalypse Now’\n\nThe Francis Ford Coppola homage to the Vietnam War captures our focus today. The conflict itself had the United States getting between two warring parties in Vietnam; the conflict extended into Laos and Cambodia. The story presented in Apocalypse Now (1979) uses these historic truths to craft a story reminiscent of the Joseph Conrad book Heart of Darkness, as reviewed here.\n\nThe fictional Nùng River supplies the path that the classified mission U.S. Army Captain Benjamin Willard, as portrayed by Martin Sheen, is ordered to take through Vietnam into Cambodia to find and end, with extreme prejudice, the continuing and unauthorized military leadership of one Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. Kurtz, bearing the same name surname as the pursued antagonist in Heart of Darkness, was portrayed by Marlon Brando.\n\nThe journey proves itself a path into each man’s heart of darkness, with an escalating sense of naivete growing from one incident to another into insanity. An early example encountered by the river patrol boat included questionable support from a helicopter-based assault unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore. Kilgore, portrayed by Robert Duvall, demonstrates a shocking suspicion towards using his command ethically. Supporting Captain Willard’s mission only gains appeal once the surfing prowess of Gunner’s Mate 3rd Class Lance B. Johnson is revealed. A famous speech by Kilgore follows the raid, occurring with its own brand of whimsy, with Sam Bottoms having portrayed Johnson.\n\nTensions rise into the continued journey owing to the increasing severity of the philosophical and moral tension Willard and the crew of the patrol boat are under. A scene with a local family trying to protect their dog echoes the rising insanity for the crew of the river boat, with the darkness taking over the spirit of the enterprise. Willard starts challenging Chief Petty Officer George Phillips, as portrayed by Albert Hall, for control of the ship. Sailing beyond the last American outpost on the Nùng River, with echoes of the identical mission of Richard Colby in his head after seeing the horrors of an outpost with leadership. Scott Glenn portrayed Colby.\n\nArrival at the temple compound Kurtz has taken command of is fraught with peril. A photojournalist portrayed by Dennis Hopper serves as a reluctant go-between for Kurtz and Willard. Engineman 3rd Class Jay ‘Chef’ Hicks, as portrayed by Frederic Forrest, serves as a confidant for Willard in this moment, and pays owing to the tactically superior Kurtz. The questions surrounding where empathy, sympathy, duty, judgment, self-awareness and cultural conflicts borne of hearts turned dark are drafted in the human condition; the mask of military service, mandated or otherwise, is a mask many wear in Apocalypse Now.\n\nFriend of the Matt Lynn Digital blog, Airport Friend, ranks this film among his ten best. John Milius, Michael Herr and Coppola all shared writing credit for Apocalypse Now, a winner of two Academy Awards, two BAFTAs and a Palme d’Or from the Cannes Film Festival. High ratings among critics and general audiences on Rotten Tomatoes also exist. I grant the Francis Ford Coppola directed and produced movie Apocalypse Now 4.25-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, June 28, 2023\n\nMitch Rapp and the book ‘Enemy of the State’ by Kyle Mills\n\nKyle Mills continues the Mitch Rapp series of books (book sequence here) created by Vince Flynn with the sixteenth (16th) book in the series, the third written by Mills. With Enemy of the State, we see that the central star of this universe of books might have met his match by way of an ongoing engagement in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia the Middle East and America that have made Mitch Rapp the enemy of the state referenced in the title.\n\nKyle Mills speaks of Enemy of the State this way on his website: “A theme in many of Vince Flynn’s books was his distaste for Saudi Arabia—a distaste that I wholeheartedly share. Despite America’s close ties, there’s just no getting around the fact that it’s a medieval dictatorship that supplied the majority of the 9-11 attackers, it continues to spread radical Islam throughout the world, and it withholds even the most basic rights from women. While our alliance with them might be expedient, it’s a deal with the devil.”\n\nThe story more or less picks up from a point in time soon after the end of Order to Kill, as reviewed here. A tacit agreement had been taken between the previous presidential regime and Saudi Arabia‘s King Faisal to cover up the Saudi involvement in the September 11th attacks in exchange for sweetheart prices for oil consumed in the United States. Part of the deal involved Faisal bringing the culpable elements in within his society to justice. American President Alexander doubts this commitment.\n\nA rogue wing of the royal family, Faisal’s nephew Prince Talal bin Musaid, has begun funding ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq). The prince’s thinking has been to position himself as the likely successor to leadership in Saudi Arabia when the king, of deteriorating health, eventually dies. The means and ends to getting to this result, with Scott Coleman still struggling to regain his former health alongside core themes of distrust for political motivations, lead to the core storytelling of Enemy of the State.\n\nMost of the twists and turns of the story of this book offer the cliffhanger qualities that one should expect. There were a couple of a pleasantly surprising nature that particularly pleased me, including part of the story that dealt with a character who had been in North Dakota. The novel’s conclusion was a bit on the mundane side for my liking, though where the larger outcome landed was as good as it needed to be. I rate Enemy of the State as written by Kyle Mills 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, December 21, 2022\n\nMitch Rapp and the book ‘Order to Kill’ by Kyle Mills\n\nKyle Mills continues the Mitch Rapp series of books (book sequence here) created by Vince Flynn with the fifteenth (15th) book in the series, the second written by Mills. With Order to Kill, we see that the central star of this universe of books might have met his match by way of an engagement in Pakistan.\n\nWritten in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, a set of pro-Democracy protests that began in Egypt and Tunisia about five years earlier, Mitch Rapp is pressed into action aiming to keep Pakistani nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists. Supporting the effort with Rapp is close friend and fellow Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative Scott Coleman.\n\nBesides the Pakistanis, who use an unconventional management approach in keeping their nuclear weapons out of harm’s way, the Americans are joined by an unexpected third party seeking to get their hands on the nuclear weapons in the region. Introducing the Russians, with an immense nuclear arsenal of their own into the mix, makes for a different situation again.\n\nAn interesting extension of the new authorship for the series includes a subtle shift in the man that the central star of this series seems to be. Without getting into the specifics for why Rapp winds up in Iraq pursuing a thread with militant ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq), the beginnings of storylines that invoke Mitch Rapp getting into an older mindset begin to show themselves in the larger narrative of Order to Kill.\n\nGiven the handful of state actors in play with Order to Kill, the complexity of the threads underpinning the story were advantages for me with this narrative. The distinctively personal touches, as suggested in the internal unfolding of the experiences for Mitch Rapp and those around him, also held sway. I definitely look forward with future books in this series to see where the professional relationship for Rapp and CIA director Irene Kennedy will be headed. In my thinking, there is room for changes within the dynamic of this solid yet complicated professional relationship.\n\nOrder to Kill works as another installment of improbable yet distinctly thrilling and gory geopolitical clandestine service bent on saving yet another devious power play from attacking American interests with assassin Mitch Rapp in the middle. The book delivers on these points while delivering something for the ongoing narrative of an assassin wrestling with the personal cost of living the lifestyle this life requires. I grant Order to Kill by Kyle Mills 4-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, April 9, 2022\n\nMitch Rapp and the book ‘The Survivor’ by Kyle Mills\n\nThe character Mitch Rapp has enjoyed a long and adventurous lifespan thanks to the series of books begun by Vince Flynn. The fourteenth book in the Mitch Rapp series when taken in order is The Survivor, which was the fourteenth book in the series when published in October of 2015. Flynn unfortunately died in June of 2013, making The Survivor the first book written by writer Kyle Mills. The sequence of the Mitch Rapp books can be found here.\n\nThe Survivor picks up from where The Last Man had left us, with traitor Joe Rickman dead. Rickman had accounted for this with a clever scheme involving a lawyer’s office, the Pakistani clandestine services and a corrupt politician bent on political gain by crippling the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), led by Irene Kennedy with tactical support from Mitch Rapp, Stan Hurley, Mike Nash and others.\n\nThe scheme hatched by deceased former CIA operative Rickman involved the release of sensitive information meant to attack methods, people, and the counter-espionage efforts of the Central Intelligence Agency. Unlikely alliances and riskier than typical tactics welcome Rapp, and his team, which involves both the aged Stan Hurley and the corrupt Louis Gould. That the means of storytelling ring true to the storyline Flynn left us in the Rapp series, along with the style that Flynn left us, were satisfying aspects of The Survivor.\n\nGiven the above elements, it becomes none other than Mitch Rapp who senses the larger stakes in play with the approach that Rickman has left behind for foreign and domestic adversaries to exploit. The increased sense of risk comes with a potential increased sense of bringing that risk under control. Does Rapp save the day? Do contingency plans for a CIA leadership team, agency or presidential confidence have room to continue? Is Mitch Rapp becoming the mental image of Stan Hurley that he fears? Check in on The Survivor for the answers to these questions, and more.\n\nThe Survivor as written by Kyle Mills was an entertaining read in the Mitch Rapp series of books. Mills‘ writing style kept the tradition laid out for us in the earlier books, which made me happy. The book entertained, allowing for me an interest in continuing to read where the larger story goes from here. The book The Survivor by Kyle Mills leads me to a rating of 4-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Saturday, November 20, 2021"
