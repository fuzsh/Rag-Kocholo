        "meta_description": "The genetic history of the Sakha people - the most North-Asian Turkic-speaking nation, is still a mystery \"behind seven seals\". There is still a desperate debate between autochthonists and migrationists that raises many new questions, including this two: \"The ancestors of which people were the first to set foot on the the farthest, northeastern Arctic limits of Asia and then the first to migrate in America?\" \"Is the geopolitical agenda hidden in the suppression of the scientific fact that of all the peoples of Asia, it is the Sakha that occupy an intermediate position between Caucasians and Amerindians on the scale of distribution of all the studied polymorphic genetic loci of humanity? Zoya I. Ivanova - Doctor of Sciences in Genetics from Russia made a direct attempt to answer these questions by describing the methods of genetics that are used to restore the ancient history of the people's migration, as well as the scientific facts that can help to understand the genetic history of the Siberian Sakha people, all Eurasians, Europeans and Native Americans. The book touches the painful points of Eurocentric interpretations of scientific facts, attacks racism, and fights for the unity of all mankind. The book will be useful for all people, especially the young that seek the truth in historical science, as it explains the basics of the paleo-genetic methods that can help to develop a non-racial vision of ethnogenesis. Drawing on the recent full-genomic research, as well as data from archaeology, anthropology, odontology, ethnography, history, theology and art history, the book justify the origin of the Sakha people, all Eurasians and native Americans from a common protomorphic North Asian Ancestor who lived in Altay, Lena River's and Baikalia's valleys, since a Paleolithic time. The author hypothesis about the origin of the Sakha people can be called \"autochthonic-migrationist,\" because it can reconcile the opposing hypotheses of the origin of the Sakha people, which now exist in the struggle with each other. Based on scientific facts, the author concludes that of all the ethnic groups of North Asia, the ancestors of the Sakha people are Paleolithic mammoth hunters, the first to set foot on North Asia and become America's pioneers. But the ancestors of neighboring Paleo-Asian ethnic groups (Evenks, Evens, Yukagirs, Nganasan etc.), which are habitually exposed as autochthons of North Asia and pioneers of America, came to the North Asia, several millennia later, from the Neolithic South-East Asia. The author gives her own definition to the terms \"Mongoloid\" and \"Europeoid.\" The second part of the book includes the author's mother stories, from the time around WWII, also the author presents several stories describing her childhood in a mining town - a former GULAG. The author Zoya I. Ivanova, ScD, geneticist, associate professor, 20 years taught genetics at the Agricultural Academy of the Sakha Rebublic (Russia) and conducted scientific research in the field of immunogenetics of the Yakutian native cattle, that engaged in issues of its preservation and study of the gene pool at the level of DNA. Zoya Ivanova wrote and published in Yakutsk - the capitol city of Republic Sakha (Russia) two non-fictional books about the genetic history, spirituality and culture of the Sakha people. Her book \"Serge - megalith of the Sakha people\" was published in 2013 in Russian and in English languages and received the interest of the readers and is acquired by several libraries, including of the Princeton University, USA. The same book in English entitled \"Sakha 's Sarga, Totem Pole and Stone Age Megaliths are from\" One Family\" was published in 2015 and now available on Amazon Kindle. According to the rating of the BookAuthority the book occupies one of the best places in between the books about the Neolithic age.",
