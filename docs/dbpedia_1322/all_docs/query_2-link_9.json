        "text": "Selecting a Russian baby name for your bundle of joy can be challenging, considering the number of options available. But our list will help you find some of the most appealing Russian baby names with meanings. Russian names follow the order of given or first name, a patronymic name, and a surname. The first name is given soon after the birth of the child. The patronymic name, which is a suffix according to the gender, is derived from the father’s first name and applies to both genders but with different endings. For boys, the patronymic typically ends with -ovich ('son of'), -evich, or -yevich. For instance, if the father's name is Ivan, his son's patronymic would be Ivanovich. On the other hand, for girls, the patronymic would end in -ovna ('daughter of'), -evna, or -yevna. Here, if the father's name is Ivan, his daughter's patronymic would be Ivanovna (1). And just like other cultures, Russian surnames are family names handed down from generation to generation. Russian names were originally composed in the Cyrillic script. When transliterated into the Western alphabet, various methods were employed, which led to some discrepancies in the English spelling of Russian names (1). In Russia, each personal name typically boasts a wide array of nicknames, with numerous diminutives and suffixes (2). This results in a plethora of potential nicknames for a single name, resulting in dozens of possibilities. While most Russian baby names originated in Russia, some names are taken from the Greek language as well, especially names from the Eastern Orthodox tradition. Some parents even combine two names to create a unique name for their baby. However, Russian baby names showcase cultural pride and identity to the nation's rich past, making them a popular choice for parents seeking meaningful names for their children. Below is the list of these names.\n\nIn This Article\n\nFilter Baby Names by Gender\n\nFilter Baby Names by Alphabet\n\nFilter Baby Names by Religion Or Origin\n\nNameGenderMeaning Mila Girl Gracious; Dear Natalia Girl Born on Christmas Eva Girl Life; The living one Alina Girl Beautiful; Bright Vera Girl Faith Myla Girl Soldier; Merciful Damien Boy Master; To tame; Divine power Lia Girl Weary; Relaxed Nina Girl Little girl; God is gracious Aniyah Girl God is gracious Samara Girl Guardian; Protected by God Kira Girl Throne; Lord; Young Kate Girl Pure; Clear Nadia Girl Hope; Moist; Tender; Delicate Nikolai Boy Victory of the people Anya Girl Grace; Favored by God Angelica Girl Messenger of God; Angelic Zariyah Girl Blooming flower Julie Girl Youthful; Downy-bearded; Soft hair; Beautiful; Vivacious Iyla Girl Moonlight; Tree Lara Girl Protection; Water fairy Marina Girl Belonging to the sea Rayna Girl Counsel; Queen Alena Girl Torch; Corposant; Tower; Moon Annika Girl Beautiful; Grace; Favor Damir Boy Peace given Natasha Girl Christmas day Nataly Girl Christmas day; Birth of the lord Zoya Girl Life Dimitri Boy Earth lover; Follower of Demeter Tatiana Girl Queen of the fairies Lilia Girl Lily; Purity Lev Boy Lion; Heart Simeon Boy Obedient; Listening; Little hyena Yuna Girl Gentleness; Friendliness Sonia Girl Wisdom Alisa Girl Noble kind Alya Girl Sky; Heaven Yuri Unisex Lily; Light Viktor Boy A form of Victor Kenya Girl Mountain of white; The one having stripes Arman Boy Desire; Hope; Warrior Mikhail Boy Who is like God Liya Girl I am with God Mika Girl Beautiful fragrance Nadine Girl Hope; Showerer of blessings Yuliana Girl Youthful Vladimir Girl Ruler of peace Odessa Girl Ukrainian port city Odesa Lidia Girl A person who is from Lydia Irina Girl Peaceful, serene, beautiful Natalya Girl Christ's birthday child Taya Girl Bandage Maksim Boy A man who is greater than others Tianna Girl Diminutive of Christiana; Follower of Jesus Christ Tania Girl Ruler; Regent Lukah Unisex Bringer of light; Light giving Lenin Boy One who belongs to the river Lena Vanya Girl Gracious gift of God Natan Boy God has provided Ania Girl Graceful young girl; Favor; Merciful Viktoria Girl Croatian form of Victoria; Victory Maiya Girl Rice valley Raiya Girl Heaven Nessa Girl Miracle; Holy; Pure Polina Girl Little; Humble Rina Girl Greens from the village; Melted or dissolved Sofiya Girl Wisdom Izabela Girl My God is an oath Olga Girl Holy; Blessed Armen Boy Soldier Arina Girl Peace Ruston Boy Rustic, strong, and rugged Sima Girl A treasure Dmitri Boy Earth lover; Devotee of Demeter Kodiak Boy Island Mishka Unisex Gift of God Bogdan Boy Given by God; A Godsent person Talya Girl Dew from god Kamir Unisex Perfect Anja Girl Grace Yulian Unisex Youthful and light-hearted Gala Girl The person who is brave; Happy and peaceful Akim Boy God will establish; The Lord exalts Tanya Girl Fairy queen Darya Girl One who is good Zarya Girl Sunrise; Dawn Nadya Girl The specific instance of feeling hopeful Taniya Girl Russian pet form of Tatiana; Fairy princess Tyanna Girl Disciple or devotee of Jesus Christ Pavel Boy Small; Humble Calina Girl A beautiful young woman Taina Girl Morning star Lilya Girl Pure; Lily flower Bela Girl Time; One who lives inside the heart Vlad Boy Rule Jelena Girl Sunray; Bright Jeremie Boy Same as Jeremy Konstantin Boy Constant Ruslan Boy One who is like a Lion\n\nRussian baby names offer a diverse range of options, reflecting the nation's vast geography and varied influences.
