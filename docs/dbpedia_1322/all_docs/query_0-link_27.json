The object of the research are the works of famous Soviet and Russian translators of foreign literature, as well as the views on the translation art of such outstanding researchers as K. I. Chukovsky, I. A. Kashkin, S. F. Goncharenko, A.V. Fedorov, E. G. Etkind, etc. Special attention is paid to the problem of translating folk speech. As an example, the authors of the article consider translations of the \"Poem about One Day\" by the Spanish poet and thinker Antonio Machado, made by I. Tynyanova and N. Gorskaya. Biographical, descriptive and cultural-historical methods were used in the work. The scientific novelty of the research is determined by the fact that for the first time a comparative analysis of two versions of the translation of one of the works of A. Machado is carried out. The relevance of this article is due to the importance of the problems of literary translation in Russian culture, the insufficient level of research of A. Machado's creative heritage in Russian Spanish studies and the lack of a detailed analysis of translations of his works into Russian. The main conclusions of the work confirm the refusal of domestic translators of foreign poetry from the \"literalist\" approach to translation, the desire to convey the spirit, images, and rhythm of the poetic text by means of the native language. This is also confirmed by the comparison of two ways of transmitting live folk colloquial speech in the analyzed translations.\n\nKeywords: translation studies, comparative analysis, foreign literature, poetry, Antonio Machado, Hispanism, artistic text, translation of a poetic text, literary translation, people 's speech\n\nReferences:\n\nBryusov, V.

The object of research is the novels \"Vadim\", \"Hero of our time\", poems \"Demon\", \"Sashka\", drama \"Masquerade\". The author of the article examines in detail the plot-compositional role of the funeral rite, the ways of its inclusion in the work, reveals the problem of the perception of death by the heroes, clarifies the nature of Lermontov's interaction with the folklore tradition. The article uses biographical, comparative-typological methods, the method of theoretical poetics, as well as methods of motivic and mythopoetic analysis of a literary work. The author of the article revealed the reasons for the inclusion of the funeral rite in the works, showed the attitude of Lermontov's heroes to death. The main conclusions of the study are the following: the funeral rite is the most frequent in Lermontov, which is explained biographically by the early loss of his mother. Scenes of funerals and burials are found in works of different genres, this determines the ways of their representation. In prose, the funeral rite is most often given in the form of a memory, while Lermontov is psychologically reliable, takes into account the peculiarities of memory, he places special emphasis on the perception of death by a child. Lermontov's funeral rite is associated with a female character, the funeral rite is often preceded by a wedding ceremony. The death of the heroine is interpreted as a return to her native land (\"Bela\") or the acquisition of eternal life.\n\nKeywords: autobiography, traditional culture, poetics, Sasha, Demon, Vadim, The hero of our time, folklore, funeral rite, Mikhail Yurievich Lermontov\n\nReferences:\n\nAzadovskij, M.

Special attention is paid to the first written works in the republic, which appeared under the influence of Arab-Muslim culture. This article examines the influence of Arabic-language culture on the formation of literary traditions of the peoples of Dagestan. Works in Arabic, Persian and Turkic languages in the spiritual literature of Dagestan testify to the centuries-old impact of Eastern culture. The manuscript gives an overview of the first Arabic-language sources written on the territory of Dagestan in the X-XII centuries. With the integration of the Arabic language in society, there is a creative flourishing of the activities of scientists of various fields of science: ethics, dogmatics, logic, Muslim law, hagiography and many others. The authors note not only the influence of Eastern literature, but also the creativity of the peoples of the Near and Middle East in the fate of Dagestan written literature and literary traditions. The authors of the article note that the spread of writing based on Arabic graphics contributed to the increase in the level of literacy of the Dagestan population, which is reflected in the literature.\n\nKeywords: Arab-Muslim culture, Islamization, Dagestan fiction, spiritual writing of the Kumyks, chronicles, historical development, Sufism, regional historiography, Arabic language, Eastern literature\n\nReferences:\n\nBol'shakov O.

The author explores the relationship between the writer and the reader in their social context. It is argued that the task of a literary critic is mainly to study the writer's technique. The task of a philosophical critic can be defined as the study of the metaphysics of a writer. Writers need the freedom of the reader for their work to exist authentically. Without this, they will cease to exist as authors, and their works will be in obscurity. Literature is an ideal means for both the writer and the reader to realize their own freedom and each other's freedom. В The author of the article comes to the conclusion that Sartre's ideas are still relevant today. As the concepts of nationality and belonging are being revised and changed, the process of globalization is underway, Sartre's theories allow critics to contextualize writers beyond such obvious boundaries. Today it seems interesting to find out whether Sartre's ideas about existentialism and literature can be applied to writers and their work in such a way that the \"critic\" can analyze both the metaphysics of the novelist and his artistic technique, and, moreover, assess his role in society and beyond. In the light of Sartre's theories, literature is the most appropriate way by which a person can realize and change society. The theories of literature and existentialism of Jean Paul Sartre can be applied to identify and analyze existential concepts in a wide variety of works of fiction, including retrospectively, which is demonstrated in this article by the example of Russian writers вЂ“ M. Y. Lermontov and F. M. Dostoevsky.\n\nKeywords: foreign literature, russian literature, theory of literature, artistic literature, existentialism, artistic consciousness, philosophy, writer, reader, free will\n\nReferences:\n\nDekart R.

The internal organization of the work (composition, image system, conflict) is based on dramatic principles, which makes the narrative as visualized as possible, and also brings it closer to the reader, who becomes not only a spectator, but also an accomplice of the events described. Descriptive and structural-semantic methods are used in the work. The methodological basis was the research of E. S. Dobin, N. M. Zavarnitsyna, V. E. Khalizeva. В The scientific novelty of the research lies in the fact that this essay is being introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. In addition, the novelty is due to the use of an interdisciplinary approach when referring to the prose work of F. I. Chudakov: the analysis of the work is based on the study of linguistic units of various levels. In the course of the study, the following conclusions were obtained: synthesizing the typological features of the epic and dramatic, F. I. Chudakov solves an important aesthetic task вЂ“ considers the inner world of a person through fixing its external manifestations. To solve this problem, the writer uses various theatrical techniques that create the so-called presence effect: situational speech of the characters not commented on by the author; detailing the appearance of the characters, landscape elements; endowing descriptions with sound and coloristic details; inappropriate direct speech (the effect of \"first-person cinema\").\n\nKeywords: the effect of presence, improper-direct speech, landscape, composition, detail, point of view, staging, essay, Towards the clouds, Fyodor Ivanovich Chudakov\n\nReferences:\n\nDobin, E.

The present study was carried out in the line of literary chronopoetics. Chronopoetics stands out as a separate branch of poetics, a phenomenon to which the methods of temporology are applied. The material for the analysis was the novel \"The Way to Grumant\", written by one of the marine writers who experienced the catastrophe of ice imprisonment, Konstantin Badigin. The Northern Sea Route is a crossвЂ“cutting theme of the entire work of K. S. Badigin, whose style dominant is the description of the nature and culture of the Russian North, the sea element. The above-mentioned determined the purpose of the study, which consists in explication of the main mechanisms and means of modeling the chronotope in a novel recreating the true event of the island stay of the Grumanlans in the XVIII century, episodes of their struggle with the outside world, a description of their life, trade, interpersonal interaction. The main result of the research is the simulation of the chronotope in the legend of Kirik and Olesha. This plug-in genre is highlighted within the novel \"The Way to Grumant\" by K.S. Badigin. It is established that in the plugвЂ“in genre, the author creates a special вЂ“ secondary to the real - world, violating the boundaries corresponding to our ideas of plausibility, this is the otherworld. The means at the writer's disposal are suitable for his description. From this point of view, the novel \"The Way to Grumant\" is being studied for the first time, which determines the novelty of the research undertaken and outlines further prospects in the field of research devoted to the work of K. S. Badigin, and the Pomeranian legend about the \"Mezen Robinsons\", in particular.\n\nKeywords: otherworld, Konstantin Badigin, chronopoetics, chronotope, mezen robinsons, legend, plug - in genre, fairy tale, chronotopic analysis, robinsonade\n\nReferences:\n\nBadigin, K.S.

The subject of the study is the analysis of female images in the collection in the context of the concept of delusion - \"delusion\". The need for such an analysis arises because, as the main causes of the decline of morality, the misconceptions in which modern society in the United States finds itself, firstly, the problem of education, the responsibility for which in traditional society lies with a woman, and secondly, the observed destruction of the traditional institution of the family, in which a woman acted as the archetypal guardian of the \"home hearth\". The scientific novelty of the research is due to the introduction into scientific circulation of the untranslated texts of Ambrose Bierce's first literary publication, as well as the selected perspective of the study of A. Bierce's depiction of female images in relation to the concept of delusion. The article uses descriptive, cultural-historical and sociological methods. It can be concluded that the key concept of delusion for the entire creative heritage of the author - \"delusion\" - was formulated already within the framework of the collection \"The Fiend's Delight\", the characters of which are in a painful gap with reality, especially with regard to female images, their inclusion in the circle of social and gender issues. Women are portrayed tragically: they are not capable of independent existence and by their nature personify an irrational principle that does not allow them to find their place in a material rationalistic society. On the other hand, they are unable to serve their nature as a mother and wife, because in marriage a woman becomes a hostage of her position and is suppressed by an aggressive masculine principle.\n\nKeywords: delusion, female image, American literature, narrator, short story, The pleasure of the monster, Ambrose Bierce, Enlightened Motherhood, education, home hearth\n\nReferences:\n\nBalditsyn, P.V.

The topic of supertexts is currently one of the most promising interdisciplinary trends in humanities. Despite the fact that literary studies feature quite a number of works dedicated to topological texts, there are virtually no research of supertext, to which Tolstoy's text is attributed to. Active creation of Tolstoy’s text falls on the turn of the XIX – XX centuries. The image of Tolstoy manifests in Shemlyov’s works of the early period, his last novel, diaries and correspondence. In literary texts, the writer creates the “protected” myth about L. Tolstoy, whole the “profane vector” can be observed in diaries and correspondence with the close circle of friends. Mythologemes that comprise Shmelyov’s myth are as follows: “Tolstoy is an outstanding Russian writer”, “Simplification of Tolstoy”, “Tolstoy is the Founder of the New Religion”. The latter is of particular significance, since Shmelyov positions himself, and is subsequently recognized by the readers, as the Orthodox writer irreconcilable with other religious pursuits. Having acknowledge the undisputable authority of L. Tolstoy as a writer, as a model for young authors, the heroes in Shmelyov’s works do not admit the spiritual leader and religious figure in the prominent Russian thinker.\n\nKeywords: mythologized representation, Russian abroad, Silver Age, Ivan Shmelev, myth by Tolstoy, biographical myth, Tolstoyan text, nominal text, supertext, mythologeme\n\nReferences:\n\nKur'yanova, V.V.

The object of this research is the lyrical works of Fazu Aliyeva and other Dagestan poets. Using the method of comparative analysis, the authors draw parallel between the Avar and Russian versions of F. Aliyeva’s poem, which has been translated by the Russian poet-translator Vladimir Turkin. The goal of this article lies in the comparative study of the lyrical poem by the Avar poet and its literary translation into the Russian language. The question of the literary translations of poetic texts from the native languages into the Russian language remains relevant at all times. The degree of accuracy and adequacy of the translation of modern or classic Dagestan poetic texts into the Russian language is yet to be fully researched. The novelty of this work consists in comprehensive analysis of the adequacy of translation of the lyrical texts of the Avar poet Fazu Aliyeva into the Russian language. The adequate professional translation into the Russian language is invaluable for the development of literature of the Caucasian peoples (and all national literatures of the peoples that are part of the Russian Federation). This helps them reach a wider readership. Juxtaposition of the original poetic text and its translation into the Russian language proves that Vladimir Turkin has achieved full adequacy of conveying the Avar text, despite the discrepancy in translating spatial details, which not in the slightest distorts the stylistic and emotional-expressive peculiarities inherent to the poem by the Dagestan poet Fazu Aliyeva.\n\nKeywords: Vladimir Turkin, content and form, Fazu Alieva, adequacy, original, translation, poetry, artistic structure, national texts, expression\n\nReferences:\n\nFazu Alieva.

Approximately fifty works by Ugric writers (both, poetic and prosaic) were analyzed using the Internet program, “Morpher”. Despite the obvious differences stylistic and thematic differences in their works, both poets and prose writers use a common set of basic concepts that comprise the backbone of cultural space of the region. The conclusion is made on the similarities that unite the texts of Ugric authors into a single cultural phenomenon. The goal of this research lies in the description of Ugric text as a unique cultural phenomenon. The article employs the results of the latest scientific developments in the field of philological regionalism and geopoetics, as well as literary works by the Ugric authors. The main result consists in elucidation of the concept of “Ugric text”, its differentiation with the concept of “literary school”. Having studied the texts of prominent Ugric writers – E. D. Aypin, S. S. Kozlov, O. B. Richter, P. A. Sukhanov, N. V. Sochikhin, Y. Shestalov and others – the author concludes on the basic concepts that determine the common mental space of Ugra and ensure the semantic integrity of Ugric text as a cultural phenomenon. It is established that due to the common conceptual framework, Ugric text not only exists as a unified whole, but also evolves, remains contemporary, and meets the spiritual needs of the audience. Comprehensive analysis of the literary works indicates that the common concepts in the poetic and prosaic Ugric text evolve and refract within the framework of the authorial linguistic worldview. The scientific novelty consist sin the fact that this article is first to analyze Ugric texts as a cultural phenomenon from the perspective of conceptual approach.\n\nKeywords: conceptosphere, concept, mental space, regionalism, Ugra text, Ugra literature, supertext, power of place, picture of the world, myth\n\nReferences:\n\nShestalov Yu.

Chinese poetry of the reform and opening-up era draws profound interest, as it reflects the transformations of modern age and worldview in the Chinese society. This article is dedicated to examination of the traditional images of Chinese literature in the lyrics of prominent Chinese poet of the late XX century Hai Zi (1964–1989). Since old days, the image of grain resembles the world of nature, fertility, cyclicity of life, symbol of ethno-poetic traditions associated with the motif of hard peasant labor. A remarkable representative of the Chinese poetry of “new generation”, whose works embody the spiritual pursuits of the era, is the poet Hai Zi. Along with the traditional motifs and images, he integrates the elements of the original concept. This article is first within the Russian Sinology to analyze the system of artistic images in the lyrics of Hai Zi. The conclusion is made that the artistic uniqueness of the works of Chinese poet, this image acquires the individual authorial content – the bearer of creative energy and active principle, the link between the world of nature and a human.\n\nKeywords: creative work, death, Haizi, artistic image, tradition, contemporary poetry, Chinese literature, lyrics, synthesis, innovation\n\nReferences:\n\nAlekseev V.M.

The object of this research is the translations of his prose works into the Russian languages conducted primarily in the last quarter of the XX century. The article employs biographical, descriptive, and cultural-historical methods. Special attention is given to Spanish translators I. Y. Tynyanov and V. S. Stolbov, whose names in the Russian literary space are closely related with the history of translation of the works of the prose writer and publicist Antonio Machado. The scientific novelty lies in the detailed description of A. Machado's prose, as well as detailed chronology of the emergence of translations of his prose into the Russian language. The relevance of this article substantiated by the absence of comprehensive analysis of the translations of A. Machado's prose works in the Russian Spanish studies. The prose works of A. Machado are also poorly studied in the Russian literary studies. The main conclusions consists in determination of the contribution of Russian translators to familiarization of the Russian-speaking audience with prose works of the Spanish author, as well as the need for further fundamental research of the entire literary heritage of Antonio Machado.\n\nKeywords: journalistic prose, essay, folklore, Antonio Machado, Spanish Studies, literary text, translation of a prosaic text, literary translation, philosophy, translation traditions\n\nReferences:\n\nChukovskiy K.

Folk poetic symbols as the genetic memory of the nation infiltrate consciousness not only as artistic material, but also as a emotions that awaken the writer’s imagination, giving rise to various associations. The subject of this research is the creative activity of folklore is in the works of the Crimean Tatar children's writers. Examination of the folklore-mythological context, determination of the peculiarities of transformation of folklore motifs in a literary reveals the creative laboratory, allowing determining the specificities of personal reflection of the writer, as well as tracing the psychological patterns of the creative process, and the evolution of artistic thinking overall. The scientific novelty is defined by the absence within Russian literary studies of monographic and significant critical works on determination of the folklore-mythological context, transformation, functionality, and interpretation of folklore elements in works of the writers. The conclusion is made that folklore as part of the culture of a particular nation, is an organic element of the artistic world of the Crimean Tatar writers, such as E. Amit and T. Khalilov. The novel by E. Amit presents the new comprehension of myths, paroemias, and legends. An example of interaction of the mythological views and modern perspective in the novel “Last Chance” is the folk legend on the “happy and unhappy stars”. It also encompasses such ancient forms of folklore as cursing and benevolence, as well as the elements that take roots in the ancient taboos, the period of totemism. In the psychological prose by T. Khalilov, an important role is played by the symbolism of birds and plants. The ancient legend of the winged horse Duldul organically intertwines with the author's creative idea without losing its specificity.\n\nKeywords: transformation, modifications, poetics, image, symbol, fairy tale, myth, interpretation, literature, folklore\n\nReferences:\n\nMinullin K.M.

Schlink, as well as assesses the impact of economic circumstances upon the formation of German collective consciousness. The object of this research is the novels “The Justice of Selb”, “The Deceit of Selb”, “The Farewell of Selb” by B. Schlink. The subject of this research is the artistic peculiarities of representation of the “German economic miracle” in the prose of B. Schlink. The writer had a critical attitude on idealizing the results of Germany's rapid economic development. He believes that mythologization of the positive results of economic development is only one side to a coin. A profound analysis of the listed novels by B. Schlink, dedicated to the theme of postwar restoration of Germany, gives a better perspective on the writer’s role in the German literary process during the late XX – early XXI centuries, which defines the relevance of this research. The goal of this article lies in studying the importance of mythological representations associated with the rapid recovery and economic development of Germany in the consciousness of the German nation, as well as their reflection in the works of Bernhard Schlink. In his novels, B. Schlink not only mentions the return of former Nazis to public and civil posts, but also draws the images of the prosperous postwar existence of German industrialists, whose factories used to supply the needs of the Reich. Depicting the conflict between the characters, the writer destroys one of their pleasant elements of the myth of “German economic miracle”. The hero – Detective Selb – reflects on the ethical questions pertinent to economic development. The life-changing event in national history, which allowed Germany to regain its rightful place among the European nations, is linked by the author with a range of negative consequences, such as development of the psychology of “consumerism” in the society, concealment of the German national past, detection of significant environmental problems, and escalation of radical moods among German youth.\n\nKeywords: German nation, German past, psychology, industry, economic miracle, myth, Bernhard Schlink, consciousness, radicalization, youth action\n\nReferences:\n\nBell', G.

The perception of the image of “foreign” and “foreign culture” is one of the pressing problems within the modern literary studies. The goal of this work is to determine the peculiarities of literary-documentary resemblance of the image of “foreign” country based on the work “The Muses Are Heard”, which is synthetic in its genre nature. The conclusion is drawn on the genre affiliation of the book and the techniques of depicting the image of “foreign culture” therein. The novelty lies in the fact that the research of this literary work are of synoptic nature, and this article is the first attempt of revealing the specificity of the image of the USSR in this work. The author indicates that the specificity of the image of the Soviet Union in the work “The Muses Are Heard is largely determined by its complex literary-documentary nature. T. Capote sets the goal to debunk the stereotypical representations on the USSR, which have formed in the American national mentality. Moreover, the writer refers to the Soviet material as an aesthetic experiment associated with the creation of a peculiar literary-documentary narrative form. The image of the Soviet Union in the work is structured on the factual documentary basis – Capote directly observes the Soviet realities and interviews the Leningrad residents. At the same time, in creating the image of the USSR, T. Capote applies the artistic and cinematographic techniques: stylization of the narrative on behalf of the “naive narrator”, method of “gradual immersion”, cropping, “pointed camera” effect, retardation, and contrast.\n\nKeywords: the other culture, national stereotypes, contrast, retardation, fact, cross-cutting, literary nonfiction, Capote, the image of Soviet Union, reception\n\nReferences:\n\nDanilin S.A.

The motives of regeneration and loss of memory are relevant in modern literature as a whole and in works of K. Ishiguro in particular. The research is based on the methods of motivic and culturological analysis. In the novel “The Buried Giant”, the theme of memory has a structural meaning. It manifests through the spatial-temporal arrangement of the text, system of characters, symbolism of the novel, and organizes the core antithesis of the work – cultural memory and “mist” (embodiment of oblivion), which creates with the plotline and images of the characters. In the text of the novel, the people lose memory; the limits between the “native” and “alien”, the past and the future are blurred. The theme of memory is the source of unravelling of the plot. The two storylines are distinguished: external (the path of the characters seeking their son) and internal (regeneration of memory). The theme of memory organizes the system of characters: the protagonists Axl and Beatrice reconstruct the events preceding the beginning of the novel and accept them. Sir Gawain and Wistan remember the past, but they have a different attitude towards collective memory: the first one wants to prolong the oblivion, while the other one wants to restore the people's memories.

I. Borodin is analyzed from the perspective of peculiarities of the embodiment of fantastic beginning therein. The author employs the holistic analysis of the text. The goal of this research consists in studying the synthesis of the fantastic and the real alongside determining the nature of the extraordinary in the novel; analysis of its key function and methods of its introduction into the artistic world. It is established that the synthesis of the fantastic and the real is associated with fact that Borodin does not intend to create an image of some extraordinary world, but seeks to actualize his emotions and find the way to resolve the internal conflict via fantastic means – journey of the narrator into the past. The relevance and novelty are defined by the fact that the work of L. I. Borodin has not previously become the object of comprehensive literary study, although it is interesting from the perspective of problematic and poetics, reflection of the theme of guilt, which is meaningful in the works of L. Borodin. It is proven the crucial function of the fantastic in the novel “It Never Happened” is associated with psychologism. The extraordinary in the plotline is a “derivative” from the emotional drama of the narrator, the strongest desire to redeem himself, and repair what was done in childhood.\n\nKeywords: a journey into the past, plot, interpenetration, psychologism, extraordinary, fantastic admission, conflict, moral issue, narrator, author’s idea\n\nReferences:\n\nVasil'eva T.

S. Shmelyov’s stories of the earlier period “On the Seashore” and \"Hassan and His Jeddi\". The stories mark a neo-realistic period in the writer’s creative path, oriented towards depicting the social and everyday realities contemporary to the writer. The goal of this article lies in classification of the characters in the context of the theme of childhood. The belonging of the Turk Hassan and the Greek Dimitraki to a different ethnic and confessional culture, on the one hand allows conducting stylistic experiments to create a speech portrait of the Russian-speaking foreigner, while on the other hand figuratively indicates the diversity and unity of the universe. The novelty of this research consists in referring to the previously undeciphered and unpublished draft materials of the stories. The relevance of the selected topic is substantiated by the need for a more in-depth analysis of I. S. Shmelyov’s works of the earlier period, as namely them lay the foundation for the artistic philosophy and development of his writing style. Based on the comparative method and textual analysis, the article reveals the similar features of the foreign characters, which testifies to the fact that Shmelyov sought for the particular traits. The connection of foreign characters with the world of childhood (blood relationship or spiritual closeness with the child-character, retained childishness of perception of the world) resembles in their images the features of the chactachers of a righteous man and mentor, which were most fully described in Shmelyov’s works of the mature period.\n\nKeywords: literature for children, hero righteous, герой-наставник, childhood theme, image of a foreigner, Shmelev, neorealism, spiritual realism, speech portrait, orthodoxy\n\nReferences:\n\nYuzefovich I.

Brodsky's cycle “Part of Speech” as literary unity. The subject of this research is the subjective organization of poems included in the cycle “Part of Speech”. Special attention is given to the nature of value attitude of the lyrical object towards other characters depicted in poems of the cycle. Such attitude is viewed as an aspect of authorial artistic reflection and assessment of depicted reality. Following the footsteps of S. N. Broytman, the author interprets the lyrical object as a speech bearer, as well as the main (encompassing other) perspective on the world in the poem. The lyrical character is a supported character, being assessed by the lyrical object (lyrical characters include a “lyrical addressee” and “lyrical You”). The scientific novelty of this research consists in viewing the nature of value attitude of the lyrical objects towards other lyrical characters in the “Part of Speech” as an aspect of poetics of the cycle as literary unity (previous studies were dedicated only to separate poems of J. Brodsky’s cycle). The analysis of selected texts of the cycle indicates the specific nature of the relationship between lyrical object and other characters depicted in the poems: 1. the relationship of the lyrical object with other characters (the lyrical heroine, “You”, etc.) is built as an anti-dialogue, demonstrating total loneliness of the lyrical object; 2. The theme of loneliness in the cycle also intersects with the artistic images for yourself; 3. in the “Part of Speech”, the forms of indirect representation of the lyric object (when the lyrical subject refers to himself as another) also point at his self-centeredness, loneliness, and disruption of ties with others.\n\nKeywords: artistic image, cyclization, lyric cycle, speaking subject, poem, lyric subject, lyric, non-classical art, lyric plot, poetics\n\nReferences:\n\nGorelov O.I.

S. Kondurushkin (1874-1919), journalist and writer, who served five years as a teacher in the schools of the Middle East, an active participant in Russia’s literary-social life, an employee of the newspaper “Rech”, war correspondent, author of several compilations dedicated to the Middle East, Russian Volga Region, Novaya Zemlya, and Siberia. The subject of this research is the techniques and approaches of creating the Middle East in the essays and stories, which were published for the first time in the journals “Russian Wealth”, “Russian Thought”, and “History Herald”. Reference of the Russian writer to the problems of the Middle East at the turn of the XIX – XX centuries, development of artistic techniques, reconstruction of the flavor and the corresponding elements of the narrative require indicating the methodology used in the article. Along with the traditional for academic literary studies comparative-historical, historical-cultural, imageological and biographical methods, the author turns to the colonial/postcolonial, as well as imperial/post-imperial formats of research, micro-history approach, “deliberate” and \"distant” reading, as well as holistic analysis. The article is first to examine the artistic peculiarities of the early prose of S. S. Kondurushkin in the context of his interest in problems of the Middle East. Special attention is given to analysis of the essay “Damascus” (1903) that demonstrates that everyday life of the religion serves for the writer as a part of the Middle Eastern chronotope, within the structure of which there are not only historical time with its transformations, not only historical space and its modern modifications, but also the current events. Such articulation of the problem defines the novelty of this research and outlines its prospects in further examination of the Middle Eastern chronotope of Russian literature of the turn of the XIX – XX centuries, and academic pursuits dedicated to the creative path of S.

The research material was the novel \"Decline and Destruction\", written by one of the recognized masters of the English satirical novel Evelyn Waugh. The \"Decline and Destruction\" of twentiethвЂ“century England is a cross-cutting theme of the entire work of I. Vo, whose stylistic dominant is the satirical grotesque. The above-mentioned determined the purpose of the study, which consists in explicating the main mechanisms and means of creating a satirical grotesque in the novel, exposing and ridiculing the vices of English society in the 1920s, sharpening and criticizing the shortcomings of the existing education system in privileged educational institutions in England. В In accordance with this goal, the article considers the problem of the emergence of the term \"grotesque\", its connection with the aesthetic category of the comic is indicated, the role and place of this artistic device in the work of I. Vo are indicated. It is revealed that with the help of a satirical grotesque, Vo creates his own special вЂ“ secondary to the real вЂ“ world, violating the boundaries corresponding to our ideas of plausibility, for which any means available to the author are suitable. The study showed that the key mechanisms determining the grotesque beginning of the novel are a combination of mutually exclusive, hyperbolization, reification of characters, etc. A special satirical expressiveness and tragicomism, brought to the point of absurdity, is manifested at various levels of the work's organization (lexical, onomastic, morphological, syntactic, graphic). From this point of view, the novel \"Decline and Destruction\" is being studied for the first time, which determines the novelty of the research undertaken and outlines further prospects in the field of research devoted to the work of Evelyn Waugh and the satirical grotesque, in particular.\n\nKeywords: absurd, tragicomism, means of creating a grotesque, mechanisms of grotesque creation, artistic reception, unreal, satirical grotesque, Decline and destruction, Evelyn Waugh, grotesque images\n\nReferences:\n\nAnikin G.

The novel contains the elements of fantasy and mysticism, which can either have purely rational, materialistic explanation or irrational – surrealistic. Therefore, the composition is viewed through the prism of synthesis of the elements of magical, irrational and familiar everyday reality. Such approach allows attributing the novel to “magic realism”, which is interpreted not as a school or direction, but a literary method used by multiple authors of various national literatures. The key characteristics of the methods as follows: system of the two worlds, binary chronotope, duplicity, and mythological implication. The complex methodological approach includes intertextual analysis and mythopoetic commentary. The conducted analysis allowed determining the peculiarities of structuring artistic world in the novel; principles of creating chronotope and conflicts between individual and the society; principles of narrative structure; and motifs. The novel by E. Nekrasova “Kalechina-Malechina” represents an example of the literary method of magic realism, which manifests on the level of system of the two worlds and development of the chronotope. Narrative structure is built on the synthesis of child’s worldview of the heroine and the author’s vision, which leads to an ambivalent perception of the world. The article provides a detailed overview of the storyline, which main theme is the initiation of the main heroine into the adult life assisted by a magical helper – Kikimora.\n\nKeywords: the initiation plot, the conflict, chronotope of the two worlds, novel, marvelous reality, folklore, magical realism, mythology, supernatural, narration\n\nReferences:\n\nBiyakaeva A.V.

The object of this research is the origin and evolution of satire in Yakut poetry. The subject is the satirical compositions of the founders of Yakut literature A. E. Kulakovsky and P. A. Oyunsky. The goal consists in determination of the role of the first writers in conception and development of satire. Yakut literary studies feature research dedicated to particular authors and works, rather than satire as a whole. Therefore, the relevance of this article lies in the holistic review of satire. The theoretical-methodological framework is comprised of the cultural-historical method, within the framework of which the conception of satire is considered a product of social life and cultural-historical conditions of Yakutia of the early XX century. The work also employs the specific-historical and comparative-typological methods of research. The scientific novelty is defined by the fact that the Yakut literary studies currently do not have a comprehensive and systemic research of satirical genre in national poetry. It is established that the pioneer satire in Yakut literature is the founder of Yakut literature A. E. Kulakovsky, who devoted his works to harsh criticism of the conservative traditions of patriarchal-feudal society, rapacity and inhumanity of the new capitalist relations. Kulakovsky was first to create gallery of the satirical portraits of social nature, such as socially classified images of stingy wealthy man, drunken bourgeois, etc. In the 1920s, the pioneer of Yakut Soviet literature P. A. Oyunsky composed works that of socially charged nature. The poet introduced the following new genres into Yakut literature: fable, pamphlet, and parody. Their works surged public thought and marked the birth of satirical genres in Yakut poetry.\n\nKeywords: problematics, satire, Oyunskiy, Kulakovskiy, founder, Yakut literature, genre diversit, image, grotesque, sarcasm\n\nReferences:\n\nVasil'eva D.

Ivanov “Community” and “Tobol” from the perspective of using the images of the Apocalypse. Examples of referring to apocalyptic symbolism in the prose A. V. Ivanov are demonstrated. Multiple examples of interpretation of Biblical symbolism of the Apocalypse are featured in popular culture; A. V. Ivanov uses the experience of such interpretations with regard to the genre of horror novel. The article considers the examples of realization of apocalyptic motifs, and their role in the works of A. V. Ivanov, namely motif of the end of the world and related cataclysms (including the phenomena of monsters and demons of the End of Time), spiritual apocalypse, and rise of the dead. The scientific novelty consists in the analysis of the aforementioned imagery as technique of horror literature. It is proven that Ivanov refers to the images of the Apocalypse through the prism of popular culture, as well as resorts to the original strategy of interpretation of the materials, where the images of the End of Time serve as the language of consciousness of the heroes as the people of their era. The conclusion is made that apocalyptic symbolism, on the one hand manifests as the marker of horror in the genre of popular literature, while on the other hand is used by the for articulation of ethical criticism of modernity.\n\nKeywords: thriller, horror, End of the world, horror literature, apocalyptic motifs, Apocalypse, Ivanov, historic novel, demons, pop-literature\n\nReferences:\n\nShcherbinina, Yu.

The object of this research is his lyrics. The depth and diversity of Âşık Ömer’s poetic system makes his work especially relevant at present. The goal this article consists in the analysis of images pf gemstones, and determination of their role in the lyrics of Âşık Ömer. The images of gemstones and noble metals in his poetry are analyzed in three descriptive aspects: external description of beauty of the beloved; description of suffering of the love mate; description of cruelty of the beloved and pain of the love mate. The research methodology is based on the hermeneutical-interpretational, descriptive method and semiotic analysis of the texts. The relevance is defined by frequency, important semantic charge, and special artistic role of the images of gemstones in the poetry of Âşık Ömer, as well as the need for their consideration and analysis. The scientific novelty consists in the fact that this article is first to carry out the analysis of gemstone images in the lyrics of Âşık Ömer. It was revealed that gemstones and noble metals are more often used for describing the beauty of the beloved, her specialty and sublimity (values). In the image of the love mate, they symbolize pain and suffering. The poet may use the same stone or metal in describing both images, but it conveys a different meaning in each case. Such expressive means are an important component of the poet's lyrics, as they imply multiple meanings.\n\nKeywords: image, lover, sweetheart, precious metals, precious stones, love lyrics, Ashyk Umer, metaphor, ruby, coral\n\nReferences:\n\nByl' i legendy o zhemchuge [Elektronnyy resurs] URL: http://www.treeland.ru/article/pomo/gems/Facts_and_legends_about_pearls (Data obrashcheniya: 15.11.2020).\n\nZabozlaeva T.

I. Sofronov-Alampa. The goal of this article consists in comprehensive analysis of the image of poet in his lyrics. The theme of poet and poetry is traced throughout his artistic journey. Alampa’s poetic heritage features 43 compositions on this topic, which is 12.6% of all his poems. It is noted that the aesthetic views and principles of Alampa were formed under the influence of the poetry of A. Pushkin and M. Lermontov. Reminiscences, constant references to the image of Prophet allow concluding that adoption of traditions of the classics led the poet to portraying the image of the Creator – a mediator between the divine powers and a human. However, the poet took a different approach towards this matter, through the “prism of the spiritual heritage of his nation”, and introduced into his native literature the image of Shaman as the higher force possessing the power of healing and word. Reflecting on the genesis of nature and poetic talent, Alampa refers to the founder of Yakut literature Alexey Kulakovsky as the Shaman – a Creator from God. But first of all, the Shaman at Alampa is a benevolent person – Algyschyt, who heals the wounded and lost souls with power of the word, and guides to the path of happiness. Sofronov grants a special mission and higher purpose to the Shaman-poet – “touch the hearts of the people with the word”. The scientific novelty consists in the attempts to examine the image of poet in the lyrics of Alampa.\n\nKeywords: Alampa, folkloric origins, mythology, Russian literature, Yakut literature, reminiscence, poet, prophet, shaman, blessing\n\nReferences:\n\nAlekseev N.A.
