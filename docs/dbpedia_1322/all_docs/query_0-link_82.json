It is easier to use this database, and to follow the report, if the two sources are consulted together.\n\nThis online database has been specially designed to permit quick comparative searches by several criteria at once: for example, the nature of the incident (Incident), the region (Federal District+) where the incident occurred, subsequent actions by the authorities (Impunity), and an assessment of the link between the death and the individual's activities as a journalist (Motive).\n\n1. Searching For An Individual\n\nIf you know who you are looking for, type their surname into the Surname box in SEARCH CRITERIA and press Search. Then in the last Actions column of SEARCH RESULTS (above) select View and press Enter.\n\nWhen you wish to return to the list of the latest deaths, press Search again.\n\n2. Complex Search and Analysis\n\nTo identify wider groups of journalists by a variety of criteria (location, type of death, reason for death, job):\n\nSelect from one or all of the five drop-down lists in SEARCH CRITERIA (Incident, Federal District +, Job, Motive, Impunity), and\n\ntype in, Year of death and M or F in Sex field in order to see how many men and women have died or disappeared under what circumstances.\n\nOnce you have made your selection, click on Search. When you wish to return to the full list of the latest deaths, press Search again.\n\n3. Reversing sequence of years\n\nYou can start with the earliest years of these records by clicking on the column heading for Date of Death in SEARCH RESULTS. This reverses the chronological sequence.\n\nMOTIVE\n\nThe key entry Motive offers an assessment as to whether a particular death was certainly, possibly or probably not linked to the investigations and publications of the journalist in question. If the link is certain this is indicated as J. If it was not linked, this is indicated as nJ. In cases where there is a possibility of a link, but the death has not been officially investigated or that investigation leaves doubts as to the motive, then the death is indicated as ?J.\n\nIf the link is considered certain this is indicated as J. If no link is suggested or established this is indicated as nJ. \"In cases where there is a possibility of a link but the death has not been officially investigated, or that investigation leaves doubts as to the motive, then the death is indicated as ?J.\n\nBy definition, cases where the are given a provisional assessment of nJ or ? when the cause of death is not confirmed (or disputed); the same applies to almost all the cases of missing journalists. Naturally, as investigations proceed and court hearings are held the assessment of motive may be revised."
