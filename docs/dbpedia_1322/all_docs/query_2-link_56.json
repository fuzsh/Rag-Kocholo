        "text": "From its high and snowy peaks to the inland sea and the rolling lowland, the common folk of Théah look out across Ussura (oo-SOO-rah) with pity and contempt. Her religion is backwards, they say, and her people uneducated. They dance under a blazing moon beside wide rivers, and never give a thought to civilized codes of conduct. Furthermore, the nobles act as poorly as their peasants. It is certain: Ussura has no future.\n\nBut as they speak, their eyes hint of fear, and when they pass within sight of the snow-filled landscape, even the bravest merchant lowers his voice. For the forests of Ussura can hear every word. Late at night when the wind wails down from the mountains and rushes through the thick trees, families gather around the fireplace and tell stories of “the Leshiye.” Ancient spirits who grant both blessings and curses. The greatest of them all is Matushka, she who stalks the forest with a broom in her hand, and if she finds young children wandering out of their homes, she sweeps them back with a quick “Tsk, tsk.” If they don’t treat her with the proper respect, she pops them in her black pot and turns them into stew.\n\nUssura is not a kind land. It is not a gentle land.\n\nBut its people have kind, gentle and humble hearts, made so by the harsh lessons they’ve learned from Ussura’s winter.\n\nThe Land\n\nUssura is covered in snow and ice nearly year round. When it isn’t covered in snow, it’s covered in mud. One visiting scholar wrote, “The Ussurans do not live in the present, but five hundred years in the past.” There are no working roads, dams or any other structure resembling modern architecture—or even antiquated architecture for that matter. Even their huts and hovels are primitive compared to the shacks of Théah’s more fortunate peasantry.\n\nBut if you talk to the Ussurans, they don’t feel like they’re living in a frozen wilderness. In fact, they look well fed. If you look closely enough, Ussura isn’t the wasteland it first appears to be. The people produce crops in land that should not support them, have surprising luck with their traps, and haul up catches big enough to make any Avalon fisher turn green with envy.\n\nTo those not native to Ussura, the land can seem actively malicious. Wild game is never found. Berries and mushrooms inevitably make the trespasser ill, and landmarks seem to change of their own accord. Meanwhile, Ussurans stroll through the chaos and wonder why people of other nationalities consider theirs a harsh, inhospitable land. After all, Matushka provides everything they need, and if she is sometimes hard, it is only because she wants her children to be strong.\n\nThe People\n\nUssurans are a short, broad people, and the commoners typically possess dark hair and eyes. Only the nobility—specifically those chosen by Grandmother Winter—bear the emerald green eyes of the Gift. Ussuran men usually grow long beards and wear their hair long; the women pull their hair back, and married women usually cover their hair with a cloth wrap known as a babushka. Across classes and genders, Ussuran complexion is pale, and they quickly redden after a few drinks. Others Théans sometimes mock their appearance as cartoonish: their noses are bulbous, and they have thick, stubby fingers that callus easily.\n\nHow do the Ussurans survive so well in a snowcovered land? “The question is a good one, but the answer is better,” said a famous Ussuran traveler. “The land cares for us, and we care for the land.” The statement is truer than the rest of Théah may imagine. In Ussura, the land itself is alive, rippling through the seasons with joy and fertility and fighting alongside its people in time of war. This is not to imply that trees bring fruit on command or that an Ussuran farmer’s life is less difficultthan farmers in any land. Rather, it shows that the land listens to her people—and rewards them for good deeds, as well as punishes them for bad. If an Ussuran farmer works hard throughout the year, and strives to place his duties before his own selfish desires, he will be rewarded. No matter how harsh the year, his crops will grow and his family will be fed.\n\nNo invasion of Ussura has ever marched beyond the first river. Barbarian hordes from Cathay died of plague and starvation. Enterprising warriors of Eisen often speak harshly of General Johann von der Velde, who led them in an attack on Ussura’s southernmost province in the year 523. The army was found after the snows melted—buried by an ice storm that began in the middle of summer.\n\nPractical, honest and forthright statements such as this are the bread and butter of Ussuran philosophy. “If it works, why meddle with it?” could be their national slogan,\n\nA typical Ussuran has a somewhat mixed heritage regardless of what he may tell you about how his pureblood family comes from west Théans, Khazari nomads or Crescents. This is less true with a boyar, who selects with more discrimination her family’s marriages and lineages, but even the noble families tend to have at least one Khazari or Crescent leader somewhere in their family tree.\n\nPeople living in Ussura range from Théan descent, Crescent descent, and those native to the land, born in the steppes.\n\nThough centuries of intermarrying has made Ussura less divided along physical boundary lines, the cultures of these various people continue to influence Ussura to this day. Architecture, education, food and even customs and stories can all point back to these major ethnic groups within Ussura.\n\nKhazari: The nomadic horse riders and herders who occupy Molhynia’s eastern and northeastern steppes migrated west across the Szabla River to escape Cathayan imperial expansion. They settled among eastern Ussura’s indigenous peoples. Their steppe horsemanship tradition has influenced all Ussura and is one reason an Ussuran does not worry that her Nation has few modern roads. The old horse trails remain as reliable as ever, especially in winter when crossing frozen rivers is easy. If foreigners can’t figure that out, that is an invasion Ussura need not worry about.\n\nA Khazar happily identifies as Ussuran, but his tribal identity is also extremely important. He has a long tradition of raiding neighboring tribes and killing to steal livestock, but no Khazar takes it personally—it is just something you do. He has had less success convincing other ethnicities to accept his “no hard feelings” attitude towards robbery and violence. He also loves travel, working with other Khazari as mercenaries, bodyguard or musician elsewhere in Théah, the Crescent Empire or Cathay during young adulthood before returning to the steppes with money, scars and stories. Outside Ussura, these mounted mercenaries are commonly called “Cossacks,” an old corruption of the word “Khazar.”\n\nKhazari are also notorious for their habit of collecting religions. The oldest Khazar religion, Turăism, worships the ancient sky god Tură. Nowadays many Khazari are Orthodox, Madhyamika, Yachidi, Vaticine, Dīnist or various combinations of the foregoing. Missionaries find converting Khazari easy, but convincing them to drop previously held beliefs impossible. Khazari abhor the concept of killing another human over a religious dispute (as opposed to because you covet her horse or her grazing land, both perfectly reasonable).\n\nCrescents: Crescents in Ussura, though a minority, dominate the markets. For as long as there has been trade, they have come to Ussura to exchange Crescent goods, medicine and resources for Ussura’s riches: furs, metal ores and agricultural products such as wheat, livestock and dairy.\n\nUssura responded to early missionary work in the Second Prophet’s wake with a widespread “thanks, but we’re fine with what we have.” Yachidis and Dīnists have nevertheless spread through southern Ussura thanks to wide-ranging Crescent traders. Dīnist congregations often worship in the same building as Orthodox assemblies without conflict. After all, Ussura has no Orthodox or Dīnist Inquisition.\n\nCrescent influence appears in Ussuran architecture, particularly government and religious buildings; no one knows where Ussuran churches’ famous onion domes originated, but some historians point to Dīnist minarets as a possible antecedent.\n\nCrescents in Ussura represent a powerful financial force, attracting both Ilya’s and Ketheryna’s attentions. Ilya is technically and ethnically half Crescent: he wasn’t raised in Crescent culture, but he has spent a good deal of time in Crescent enclaves throughout southern Ussura and maintains good relationships with prominent Crescent merchants, entrepreneurs and investors. Ketheryna, who built about half her entire new capital full of expensive machines and structures on credit, desperately pursues Crescent support as well. She promises boosted trade with the Empire, exclusive access to rare Ussuran resources such as demantoid gemstones and even boyardoms for particularly generous contributors. Yet Lady Arzu of Gallenia, Ussura’s most influential Crescent, doubts Ketheryna’s promises. After all, she has said the same to many Théan diplomats. Can she really make good on so many promises in so many different directions?\n\nTamatama Nomads: Caravans of the Tamatama, an ethnic group originating far to the southeast in Agnivarsa, travel throughout Ussura, mostly along waterways between major cities but occasionally via ancient horse trails non-Ussurans don’t know. Nowadays, you are most likely to find them in Veche Province.\n\nUssuran Tamatama are mostly Dīnist. They occupy a peculiar but comfortable social position as entertainers: musicians, dancers, actors and suchlike. Their traveling lifestyle means the Tamatama rarely intermarry with other groups, though this is a matter of convenience rather than prejudice. A Khazar on her way to adventure through the rest of the world often links up with Tamatama caravans for part or all of the way, swapping songs and updating one another’s maps.\n\nSome wider-ranging Tamatama bands are responsible for the cross-pollination of dance styles throughout different parts of Théah. Thanks to the Tamatama, ballet, a physically and technically demanding performative dance form originating in Montaigne, has become all the rage at many boyars’ courts, especially in modern Bashanta. Ketheryna’s Imperial Theater in Bashanta, which features the latest mechanical contraptions and special effects systems for stage performances, has hosted many Tamatama performances.\n\nSocial Strata\n\nThe people in Ussura form two primary classes: the muzhik (moo-ZHIK) and the boyars (BOY-arz).\n\nThe muzhik are the peasants, while the boyars are the landowners in Ussura: they collect a portion of the muhzik’s crops in return for letting them use the land. Among the muzhik, the largest and strongest typically receive the most respect. Contests of physical prowess often occur in rural villages: everything from arm wrestling to footraces to tug-of-war. Women are not excluded from these contests by any means, but they tend to prefer games where their superior stamina helps make up for their lack of brawn.\n\nThe status of a boyar has more to do with how much land he owns than how strong he is. Certainly, there is status to be won at the local fairs by winning a contest or two, but a boyar who owns only a small parcel of land will never be as powerful as one who owns hundreds of acres. At the top is the royal family: the most powerful boyars in Ussura. The head of the royal household is called the Czar (taken from a title in the Old Republic) or Czarina. The title is inherited from one generation to the next and can change from family to family depending on political and military power.\n\nYou can usually tell an Ussuran’s social class from her appearance, especially her hair color. Boyars have light-colored hair and beards, usually blond; whereas muzhiks have dark hair, as well as darker skin from the sun or from Cathayan ancestry. Different regions and families may have different attitudes towards boyars fraternizing with commoners. Rare as it may be, no one will string you up for being a boyar with dark skin and hair, a commoner with light skin and hair, a dark-haired person marrying a light-haired person, etc.\n\nThat said, many Ussurans make assumptions about someone else’s class, wealth and education based on her coloring. Moreover, the fact that the upper classes have more western Théan ancestry and the lower classes have more indigenous and Cathayan ancestry is not lost on anyone, especially in the current political climate dividing the country on class and visual lines.\n\nThe boyars’ favorite, Ketheryna Fischler Dimitritova, ethnically Eisen, looks the part, with strawberry blonde hair and light blue eyes; whereas the lower classes’ favorite, Ilya Sladivgorod Nikolovich, has his Crescent surrogate mother’s dark eyes and hair. Many muzhiks suspect Ketheryna’s push to modernize the country and advance its technology only further divides the classes.\n\nBogatyr\n\nThe bogatyr are the wandering nobility of Ussura, seeking their fortune among the cities and open land of the nation. Traditionally, the difference between a boyar and a bogatyr is land: a boyar usually has extensive holdings and does not need to sell his services, while a bogatyr has no land and must rely on the generosity of his or her lord. Many bogatyr are sell-swords, using a noble’s training with the sword and axe to join the military and rise in rank, or to become the captain of the guard for some Ussuran town. Others become merchants and draw on their courtly contacts to trade among the provinces. These bogatyr become members of the smerdi, or landless merchant class, and their children are no longer considered nobility. A few bogatyr travel outside Ussura’s land, seeking fortune and wealth in Eisen, Vodacce, or even distant Castille. When they return, they may have amassed enough money to purchase a boyar’s house and estates and create their own lineage–but this is rare.\n\nVyeche and Smerdi\n\nBeneath the boyars and bogatyr are the merchants, which technically form the first ranks of muzhik peasants (though the occasional business-minded bogatyr blurs the division somewhat). The vyeche (a catch-all term for those freemen who control their own lands or are the headmen of towns) are the more prestigious of the middle class. They are the men of the town or large farm, whose contributions to society can be measured by their full grain silos and wellfed peasants. They serve as the voice of the people, bringing their concerns to the boyar and carrying out his commands among the zakupi peasants. They raise the towns, follow the tenets of Orthodoxy, and serve Matushka with their hearts and hands. Vyeche ruling councils typically have authority over a single city, a small group of townships or a large area of farmland comprised of many small holdings.\n\nThe smerdi, on the other hand, are merchants, artisans, craftsmen, and bureaucrats. They are less respected, but their contributions keep the wheels of society turning. Some members of the smerdi class rise to prestige through the beauty and fine craftsmanship of their work: such workers are known as Typov, or “Masters” of their labor. In modern times, the term smerdi has come to include merchants with no land, those who sell their wares in cities and maintain little contact with the countryside. Although less prestigious than the vyeche, they are nonetheless respected for their prestige and position in society. Few of them are born noble, and those who are descend invariably from the wandering, landless bogatyr.\n\nBoth the smerdi and the vyeche learn to read and write, to be fluent in numbers and recite their psalters. The schools of the Orthodoxy require that any middle-class child being apprenticed to a trade must spend three years of his seven-year tenure going to classes within the church. This law was created in order to educate the middle class and teach them the concrete knowledge common to Théah’s other learning centers. Despite their rough exteriors, most of Ussura’s middle class can hold their own in philosophical and mathematical arguments.\n\nZakupi and Kholopi\n\nBeneath the vyeche are the true muzhiks. First the zakupi, landless laborers, itinerant workers, and others who live on and work the land belonging to a rich vyeche or smerdi. The zakupi are technically free men, but remain bound to the land they work. Some are indentured servants, others are simply lower peasantry.\n\nBeneath the zakupi stand the lowest form of peasantry—the kholopi, who serve as virtually slave labor on the farms and in the towns of Ussura. These peasants are so indebted that they no longer own their freedom, but live from day to day at the command of a vyeche or boyar. Their lives, while not necessarily unpleasant, remain severely limited by the Law of the Vyeche–no kholopi, and no kholopi’s child, may leave his master’s land without permission. Any kholopi who does so forfeits his position within his master’s household. He is turned out upon the land and left without food, water, clothing or a home. In the harsh Ussuran weather, this sentence predictably ends in death.\n\nBecause the Czar normally comes from these classes, the boyars cannot completely ignore them. Though higher education in Ussura is woefully lax, the Orthodoxy imparts rudimentary learning to almost everyone. The common Ussura peasant can count, add and subtract, and both read and write simple letters. This tradition began over three hundred years ago, when the Czar came from the kholopi. Because it took him a great deal of time to learn to read and write once he had inherited the nation, he demanded that the church provide a rudimentary education to all levels of society. The Ussuran Orthodoxy thus imparts the basic practices of their religion as well as simple letters and arithmetic to every child. In so doing, they prepare the next Czar (whoever he may be) for the task ahead of him.\n\nClothing\n\nThe Ussurans wear long, warm clothes called “caftan,” tightly buckled around the waist and often layered to keep out the cold. In frigid Ussura, clothing tends to be more functional than decorative—holidays and feast-days excepted. Generally, muzhik women wear a blouse, skirt and a simple apronpiece that covers the skirt. The apron can be quite elaborately embroidered (most young girls learn to embroider by practicing on their aprons) and has different names according to its shape and region. Most clothing is woven from linen, hemp and wool.\n\nMen’s dress is simpler, consisting of a long or short shirt depending on the region, and a pair of trousers which can also be tight or quite baggy according to the region and the man’s profession. Men typically wear a woven belt or a leather one from which they hang their work tools. In winter both sexes wear thick cloth coats or cloaks of beautifully decorated sheepskin.\n\nThose who can afford luxuries (i.e., the boyars) are inclined to dye their clothing in bright oranges and reds. Boyars who actively own and manage land always wear bright red boots to show their station.\n\nFood\n\nUssurans eat the same things the rest of Théah eats, though their climate is not conducive to the cultivation of a wide variety of vegetables.The typical muzhik diet includes foods such as cabbage soup, turnips, garlic, pickled cucumbers and jams. Bread is served at every meal. Ussurans cultivate large amounts of grain, especially a wheat porridge called kasha and unleavened bread called khleb. The grimmuk (red wheat) of Molhyna, so named because the heads turn a deep crimson when ripe, is used in baking Molhyni “blood bread.” Eggs and milk are far more plentiful than meat, which is typically eaten only when the muzhik has time to trap or hunt. Mushrooms are highly valued, and dried and preserved for use through the long winters. Fish is a staple on the coasts. The fishermen of Lake Vigil catch hordes of tiny episura which they press into small cakes that are considered delicacies. Red meat is rare, but prized. Cows are not uncommon, but Ussurans value them more for their milk than their meat. Nearly every family keeps a goat. There is always plenty of fresh water from snowmelt, and Ussura brews a whole series of alcoholic beverages: the usual vodkas, a series of ciders and brandies, and a particularly disgusting concoction brewed by the Kosars which is made from goat’s milk.\n\nCustoms\n\nFew of Ussura’s cultural pressures came from Numa and its forebearers, and she remained largely untouched by the rise of the Vaticine church. Her influences range from distant Cathay and the Crescent Empire to the geographical burdens of snow and ice and the difficulty of travel. Insular and distant, Ussura relies on herself for her preservation, and with Matushka’s help, she does not need to look elsewhere.\n\nThe short summers and long, inhospitable winters dictate the Ussurans’ lifestyle. They work feverishly in the summer, trying to bring in their harvest before the first frosts settle on the fields. In the winter, they spend most of their time inside their small houses, seated on or near the stoves that form the center of their households. They possess a great love of alcohol, and spend much of the winter in the drunken revelry that makes these long periods of isolation bearable.\n\nMost “heavy” or important talking is done over spiced tea (called chay) at the kitchen table, the undisputed center of the Ussuran home. Most Ussurans have a central, wood-burning stove in the kitchen called a pechka, and a guest is often invited to sleep on its upper reaches to keep warm. On the last day of the week, all the muzhik take two hours out of their daily schedule in the morning to worship Matushka (while giving thanks to the Prophet) at the village altar. Typically, the most learned man in the village leads the ceremony; most villages can’t afford actual priests.\n\nUssurans are tremendous gift givers and commonly exchange tokens and other small items. Ussurans give presents to guests, to those who wish to conduct business, or as a transfer of small tokens of generosity. This is an ingrained tradition, and visitors to Ussura ignore it at their peril. Many times an ambassador has been turned away from a boyar’s home simply because he bore no token of esteem for his host or host’s family. The best gifts have some small rarity or value: sketches of one’s home country, small porcelain or semi-precious statuettes, useful household trinkets such as kitchenware or knives, children’s toys or clothes, picture books, and any truly practical items. Gifts are also used to “grease the wheels”: for instance, to encourage someone to listen to a political proposal. Many Ussurans give gifts as a way of asking someone to be their host for the evening—a sort of reverse invitation.\n\nDuring the winter, families stay indoors most of the time, relaxing, telling stories, visiting neighbors, drinking and playing games. Since Squares was introduced to Ussura, it has become very popular, allowing a bored family to while away several hours at a stretch.\n\nUssuran Holidays\n\nTo pacify and live within the complicated supernatural world of gods and spiritual creatures, the ancient Ussuran tribes worked out a schedule of prayers and rituals. As civilization advanced, the calendar of seasons, holidays and traditions coagulated. Ceremonies were connected to the seasons and agricultural events, and are still observed today as they were a thousand years ago.\n\nThe year starts on Primus 1st. New Year celebrations (Theustide) lasts through a full 12 days of festivals and feasts. In ancient days, the 12 days of Theustide were known as Matushalia, the celebration of Mother Matushka and her eleven children. The Orthodoxy co-opted this time to create a celebration that honored both Matushka and Theus.\n\nThe largest “pagan” holiday is Shrovetide–a wild, raging welcoming of spring, with all that that implies, amid preparations for a new farming season. The Church has taken steps to eliminate the celebration of Shrovetide along with its wild revels, but has not managed to stamp it out. Another major pagan celebration is the night of the Summer Equinox—a grand celebration, coupled with prayers to Matushka, calling for a long harvest season.\n\nDuring the Winter Equinox, people in Ussura refuse to sleep through the longest night of the year. Instead, they stay awake, lighting large fires and carrying torches through the village while playing musical instruments. According to folklore, if people fall asleep during that night, they will be swallowed up by Vrost Dvoya, the spirit of nightfall. The evil spirit will carry them away, and they will never awaken to see the returning sun.\n\nThundermas is the day dedicated to Peroon, ancient god of thunderstorms. Unlike other Ussuran holidays, Thundermas is a sad and frightening holiday, reserved for fervent prayer and sacrifices of harvest fruits and toys. Thundermas placates Peroon, since the harvest has almost grown and any accident or brutal weather could destroy the crops before they could be harvested. The Orthodox church has altered Thundermas into St. Ilea’s day, and holds the celebration (usually a somber and regal procession through the center of town), on Julius 20th.\n\nThe most important day of the year for any Ussuran is Rebirth Day, the third day of Corantine. It celebrates the anniversary of their bargain with Matushka. On this day, every Ussuran, even the smallest child, has his or her left thumb pricked with a needle and spills a drop of blood on the ground to help nourish Matushka. The day is then usually spent in prayer and song.\n\nEtiquette\n\nUssura is deadly cold, and villages are often separated by walks of two weeks or more. As a result, no Ussuran refuses hospitality to anyone who enters the village except under the most extreme circumstances. Refusing to give a traveler some food and let him warm himself up by the stove is tantamount to murdering him. This gives rise to the Ussuran reputation for generosity.\n\nAn Ussuran will not hesitate to share his food, camp, liquor or even tent with a fellow traveler in need. He will be gravely insulted if not shown similar courtesy, however; it would be like telling him that you don’t care whether he lives or dies. Ussurans traveling in other countries have often been gravely insulted when asked to pay for a meal they assumed was hospitality. Such arguments often end in fistfights, giving the Ussurans a reputation of hot-headedness.\n\nTable manners are casual, and the Ussurans have a relaxed attitude towards nudity. Their steam baths are communal. Bathers strip before entering, rush inside out of the cold, sweat in the heat as long as they can stand it, and then run outside again to rub themselves down with handfuls of snow or jump in an icy stream before drying off and redressing. People from other Nations who witness this ritual often stand openmouthed in astonishment, not only at the casual attitude towards stripping in front of strangers, but also at their tremendous ability to withstand such brutal treatment.\n\nArchitecture\n\nFor most of its history, Ussuran architecture has fallen into two categories: religious and practical. Practical buildings are meant to last only a generation or two, and are often made of mud or sod, or built of wooden beams and platforms. Religions architecture, on the other hand, is mostly stone, and designed to face the rigors of centuries.\n\nMuzhiks rarely build anything to last more than a generation or two, which fits it well with Matushka’s cycle of death and rebirth. Most Ussuran peasant structures are made of mud brick. Wood or stone is used where available, assuming the forest gives permission. The cities of Ussura follow building techniques practiced both in ancient Rurik and the Numan Empire. Streets are long and straight, with little deviation, and palaces stand outside of the city bustle and noise. Walls separate the districts, and some roads are paved with cobblestones in order to keep them from turning to mud in the spring. Most city buildings are made of wood, with sod or clay-tiled roofs, but tremendous stone palaces and cathedrals tower over the smaller houses and businesses. Overall, Ussuran cities are brighter than cities in other parts of Théah. Jewel-toned paints shine from roofs and walls, and brightly painted icons are displayed throughout the merchant districts. Onion domes glisten in the winter sunlight, and many churches in Somojez and Rurik have roofs of shining gold leaf.\n\nReligious Buildings\n\nFor centuries, churches were the only buildings to be constructed of stone, and today they are almost the only buildings that remain from its ancient past. The basic elements of Ussura church design emerged fairly early, around the eleventh century. Churches stand in the form of an open-armed cross, or ‘x’; the walls are high and relatively free of openings. Sharply-sloped roofs and onion domes cover the structure.\n\nWith the establishment of a unified Ussura, foreign architecture began to appear in churches as trade burgeoned between the nation and the other states of Théah. The first instance of such foreign work is Sousdal’s grand Assumption Cathedral, completed in 1479 by the Vodacce architect Presclau Fioravanti. The cathedral actually blends traditional Ussuran architectural styles with classical Vodacce proportions. Long considered an ideal of Ussuran iconic art, it serves as the model for countless versions throughout the nation.\n\nArt and Music\n\nBelief in pagan nature spirits never died out even after Ussurans embraced the word of the First Prophet. This duality caused the country to find ways to merge the two belief systems. One of the methods they use to show this unity of faith is through iconic paintings, a style practiced since before the rise of Numa. Painting modern Orthodox figures in the old style–frequently accompanied by the legends or symbols of the ancient faith–provides a continuity of belief that carries through both religions and into Ussura’s very distinct faith.\n\nIcons\n\nThe tradition of icon painting came to the rest of Ussura from the Rurik culture. It began as an offshoot of the mosaic and fresco tradition of ancient Rurik churches, adopting their ornate stylizations with each new generation. Nowhere else in Théah is this form of art practiced; it is an Ussuran legacy. During the early centuries of the Ussuran Orthodoxy, a controversy in the church called into question whether religious images were a legitimate practice or sacrilegious idolatry. Although they didn’t ban the use of images, they did draw an important distinction between art intended to depict reality and art designed for spiritual contemplation. Certain kinds of balance and harmony became established as reflections of divinity.\n\nUssuran icon paintings do not accurately depict physical space or human appearance. They are incredibly stylized, overexaggerated, and picaresque. Icons are intended to aid contemplative prayer and convey meditative harmony. After all, the powers of Theus and his Prophet are beyond human ken; so, too, does Ussuran icon painting carry the onlooker into a place where the world is subtly different–seen, perhaps, through Theus’s eyes. The paintings represent figures in their two-dimensional heavenly form, not their natural form. Artists often invert perspective in order to thrust the central point out rather than draw the viewer to a disappearing point within the picture; light comes only from within the holy person depicted and therefore casts no shadows.\n\nWooden Carvings\n\nUssurans are famous for their wooden miniatures. They have been known to spend days crafting a single hand for a doll that stands no bigger than a man’s thumb. Their work is minutely detailed, and often so precise that foreigners cannot see the seams where the tiny parts join together. Every year in the town of Siev an enormous contest is held and wood carvers from all over Ussura enter their finest pieces in the competition. The prizes are donated by the boyars attending the contest, and while they vary wildly from one year to the next, they are always worth the trip. Last year’s grand prize was an exquisite sleigh with four fine dogs to pull it. The year before that, the winner received twenty acres of land and was made a minor boyar.\n\nEgg-Painting\n\nFrom time immemorial the egg has been the object of religious adoration. Ussura has long practiced the art of painting eggs, known as pysanka, an ancient word meaning “to write.” In Ussuran Orthodox traditions, the colored egg is one of the main symbols of spring. The reverence of these colored eggs grew into a tradition of painting and presenting the colored eggs on the first day of spring. Pysanka eggs tend to be richly ornamented with two, three or four colors, often covered in ornate designs or patterns. The patterns and symbols of pysanka are well known throughout Ussura, and can form a code of their own. Rarely are these codes used to confer secret information (other than a young man’s wish to woo a young woman), but it is possible to use Pysanka to convey simple messages and ideals.\n\nA rarer variant of pysanka is called “krashenka.” Krashenka are egg-shaped works of art, not generally made of eggshell. Some krashenka consist of blown eggs filled with candy, or eggs carved of wood or made of spun glass. In recent times, some krashenka eggs have been made of gold and precious metals, and some are so complex that they are really small boxes with moving parts, clockwork motion, or incredibly delicate paintings inside the golden shell.\n\nThe artisan Leon Ivanov Batist created three of the most famous krashenka to commemorate the coronation of Czar Piotr II in the late 1200s. The first, a gift to Empress Praetora v’Riasanova, was a rich scarlet color and held a miniature copy of the Imperial carriage inside. Although the egg has been lost, many descriptions of it still remain. The second, called the Knias’s Heart, remains within the grand palace at Ekaternava. It is a self-winding table clock in a form of a pyanska egg, which softly chimes every hour. The egg has a small latch, known only to the Novgorov royal family, which, when opened, reveals a splendidly colored, jeweled rooster. His final egg, named the Windows of the House, was made of pure gold, carved and painted on the outside with the faces of all the Gaiuses that ruled the country before Piotr. There is a globe inside the egg which opens with a small golden key; it contains symbols of the Orthodoxy, entwined within the branches of a miniature silver oak.\n\nMusic\n\nUssuran music is loud and boisterous, and often a bit off-key: the communal experience is more important than the beauty of the song itself. Most of the songs are spirituals that praise the land. A few children’s songs tell stories about the most common fairy tales, such as the tale of the head of the Riasanova family who acquired the ability to transform into the Firebird. The truth of the song remains to be seen.\n\nNames\n\nIn Ussura, family names may be long, convoluted, and peculiar. When a common muzhik’s child is born, he or she receives a first (or “Prophet’s”) name, such as Pavel. Each child’s last name is a modification of the father’s name (in this case, Ivan). The ending -ova (or -ovna) on a surname denotes a daughter, such as Ivanova (daughter of Ivan). In a similar fashion, the name ending -ov denotes a first son: Ivanov. The ending -vich denotes a second, or lesser, son. It is common practice to add the name of the town or village as a middle name for the child, so that his or her home becomes part of his or her identity.\n\nUsing the fictional Ivan of Ekatnava as an example, his children might be named:\n\nFirst Son: Pavel Ekatnava Ivanov\n\nSecond Son: Nikolay Ekatnava Ivanovich\n\nAny Further Sons: First Name Ekatnava Ivanovich\n\nFirst Daughter: Makhaia Ekatnava Ivanova\n\nAny Further Daughters: First Name Ekatnava Ivanova\n\nWhen Pavel marries, his wife, Iviana Brislav Petrovna, adds his name to her own, using the additional surname ending -tova, and would become Iviana Brislav Petrovna Paveltova. The firstborn son of Pavel, Aleksei, would use his own father’s name as his surname, and thus would be Aleksei Ekatnava Pavelov.\n\nBoyars use a simplified variant of the common naming practice. While they alter their surname to conform to their parent’s name, they sometimes use their mother’s first name as their surname instead. They almost always choose the parent with the higher social standing. No matter who the parents are, each boyar’s child uses their familial title at the end of the surname, noting that he or she descends from one of the five leaders of the original Knias. Appropriately, the surname created by the original Knias member (Novgorov, Vladimirovich, Pietrov, Riasanova and Pscov) has become the familial surname, prefixed by the modifier ‘v’ (of ). Thus, a wealthy boyar’s child of good lineage might have the name Mikhail Ekatnava Elizavetov v’Riasanova.\n\nCommon Male Names: Aleksei, Alexandr, Boris, Dimitri, Danil, Erema, Fyodor, Georgi, Ignati, Ilya, Kiril, Mikhail, Nikita, Pyotyr, Sergei, Taras, Timofey, Vasily, Vladimir, Yevgeni\n\nCommon Female Names: Agafya, Anna, Avdotia, Darya, Ekaterina, Elizaveta, Galina, Irina, Ksenya, Larisa, Ludmila, Lyuba, Marya, Nina, Natalya, Natasha, Nastasya, Olga, Sofia, Tamara, Yelena, Yevpraskia, Zhanna\n\nReligion\n\nThe Ussuran Orthodox Church is the state religion, combining the First Prophet’s words with the native Ussuran reverence of the Leshiye. Most of the attention goes to the chief matron of the pantheon, the entity known as “Matushka.” Matushka is said to appear as an ancient, matronly woman with iron teeth and nails. Children must be polite if they should encounter her, for she devours rude little boys and girls. She brooks no impertinence, but generously rewards those who treat her with respect. Ussurans feel that nature serves as a guide to proper behavior, and visitors who don’t understand this aspect of their religion often find themselves utterly confused by some of the Ussuran customs.\n\nThe Orthodoxy ignores the Second and Third Prophets entirely, feeling that their messages went against the intent of the First Prophet. After all, things had been going so well; what reason was there for them to change? This decision put them at odds with the rest of the Vaticine Church, so there has been little contact between them since the coming of the Second Prophet.\n\nGovernment\n\nUssura is a land of contradictions, where a man born as a peasant leads the nobles, and where the needs of the land must take precedence over the needs of the people. While other nations boast of the long and proud lineages of their ruling families, the Ussurans boast of the wealth and prosperity of their land. Nobility means nothing to their most powerful ruler—the Czar—for, traditionally, they are born of peasant stock, and do not know what their role will be until the day their hair turns white as snow.\n\nThe Czar, equivalent to another nation’s King or Imperator, is the final justice in Ussura. They rule the nation with an iron hand, serving as the chosen voice of Matushka. When the old Czar dies, their children do not always assume the throne. Instead, seven riders leave the capital city of Pavtlow and search through the land for the next Son of Matushka. The riders do not search through the noble families of the boyars (lords), but rather through the peasantry of the land. Invariably, they find a young man or woman whose hair turned as white as snow upon the moment of the old Czar’s death. That individual, be it a grown adult or a child, has been chosen to rule by Matushka. The riders take them back to Pavtlow with his family, and give them the rulership of the land.\n\nTo many outside Ussura, this has no more credence than a fairy-tale. A young child, a peasant, whose parents work hard all their lives and raise their son to be honest and noble suddenly becomes the ruler of one of the most powerful nations in all of Théah? And worse, it happens once in every generation? Even the Inish, trapped under the chaotic rule of Jack O’Bannon, prefer their own brand of madness to that of Ussura’s Czar.\n\nThe Power of the Czar\n\nThe Czar’s power is not absolute. They rule Ussura and makes decisions for the peasantry and universal law, but they are not the unquestioned master of the Five Kingdoms. Rather, they unify their law and custom and provides a constant system of justice over all Ussura. They are the high Lord, with little land of his own, but with power over those who do control the land. The leaders of the Five Kingdoms meet periodically as the Knias Douma, the advisory council to the Czar, and keep their lands beneath his watchful eye. They do not rule them–but hey do command them.\n\nIn this manner, the five Knias rule their territories independently except on occasions when the Czar directly intervenes for the sake of the larger nation. The Czar can only make decisions for the Five Kingdoms in cases of national interest. Though the lords of the Knias Douma pay them lip service and obey their direct commands, they do not turn to the Czar for internal policy. The Czar truly rules Pavtlow, as the City of the Czar, but nothing more.\n\nStill, the Czar’s control has increased over the last few generations, as the Knias lends them more power and the peasantry comes to rely on their decisions more and more. Some members of the Knias Douma believe that this is a good trend, leading Ussura into true prosperity, while others see it as an usurpation of their rights.\n\nThe Knias Douma\n\nThe Knias Douma is technically a council of advisors to the Czar. Under normal circumstances, the Douma usually holds the real power in Ussura. However, with everything in flux, nobody holds the true power. With only a few exceptions, the boyar families have become quite adept at manipulating the Czar over the years. There are five positions on the Knias Douma, each permanently held by a powerful boyar family.\n\nLaws\n\nUssurans take the issue of law very seriously, and those who commit crimes on Ussuran soil are rarely spared. The Pravda, or laws, of the Ussuran people are simple and straightforward (the literal translation means “truth”), and are respected in every city and province. Although the five Knias have additional laws, and provincial governors add to the Pravda as necessary, the basic laws of Ussura are widely known and do not change. Likewise, capital punishment is still common in Ussura—a gallows can be found in most towns and stocks stand outside every courthouse, even in villages. Those who break the law in Ussura can expect to be reminded of their penalty by scars and lash marks.\n\nEconomy\n\nMost of Ussura’s exports are furs. There is also a strong trade in honey and beeswax. As for imports, Ussurans mostly purchase spices, various types of alcohol and steel. The boyars oversee this trade and have an income comfortably greater than even the hardest-working muzhik.\n\nMost of the commerce inside Ussura is conducted in barter, since no centralized coinage has yet been adopted. The Guilder has started to worm its way into the country, but unscrupulous traders often misrepresent its value, leaving the Ussurans a little distrustful. As they are wont to say, “My family cannot eat money.” Many areas, however, use a gold coin known as a “grivnas,” an ancient currency which roughly represented the Ussuran price for one month’s labor. The grivnas has never been uniformly adopted, and each province and territory has its own versions of the coins. Some Vendel merchants offer an exchange rate of approximately one grivnas for ten Guilders, but such coins are rarely traded outside of Ussura.\n\nMilitary\n\nInvading armies who march on Ussura usually meet with disaster. Vast legions from the Crescent Empire died of plague and starvation; troops from Cathay still refuse to march west into Ussura after failed invasions in the late 800s. Eisen soldiers, in particular, still reminisce about General Idun von der Velde—grandson of General Johann von der Velde—who tried to overcome his grandfather’s failure to take Ussura in 523. His army fared no better.\n\nBecause they do not have an organized army, however, does not mean that they lack armed forces. The Knias of each province maintains a “personal guard” which enforces the laws, hunts bandits, and performs other military duties. Each of these forces has its own command structure, rules of conduct, and edicts (usually handed down by their particular Knias) which it must obey. Though not strictly armies, they serve many of the same functions in their respective provinces, and in some cases can grow quite large. Gallenia, for example, maintains a large number of troops in order to defend against incursions from the Kosars.\n\nUssura hasn’t needed a standing army for centuries. Most boyars still maintain small home guards, and the Czar has his streltsy , but otherwise there is no Ussuran army. There isn’t a navy, either, unless you count the fishing fleet that sails Grumfather Bay.\n\nSuperstitions\n\nDespite their practical bent and solid intelligence, Ussurans are plagued by numerous superstitions, designed to remove bad “blessings” and other plagues. For years the Ussuran people have practiced simple, native cures to their ills, both mental and spiritual. This often leads to ridicule from other nations, but the people of Ussura hold their beliefs dear:\n\nThe birth of a child is celebrated by planting a tree.This tree grows as the child does, and if it flourishes, Ussurans believe the child will flourish as well. An old Ussuran legend tells of a mother whose son went to war, and on the day of his death, his child-tree instantly withered and died.\n\nIn Somojez, the children throw their baby teeth on the roof of their cottage and ask Grandmother Winter to give them an iron tooth in exchange.\n\nFlowers in even numbers are reserved for funerals or tragedies. Odd numbers suffice at all other times. Hence, the Théan tradition of giving a young lady a dozen roses would scare an Ussuran greatly, and even be considered a threat against her life.\n\nEvery home in Ussura is believed to have a domovoi, or gentle spirit who guards it. Many times, this spirit is as much a prankster as a friend, and it lives in the pechka oven at the center of the home. The domovoi bothers the house’s inhabitants, steals an occasional sock, and sometimes misplaces the knife, but it is generally a friendly spirit.\n\nCurrent Relations\n\nAvalon: The Ussurans think the Avalons are great fun to have around. Their tricks delight like few other things. Of course, an Avalon who uses his abilities to rob or cheat an Ussuran is liable to gain a more persistent enemy than he anticipated. Ussurans have long memories.\n\nCastille: “Although you Castillians are somewhat pig-headed, you have your hearts in the right place,” a minor boyar once said to a visiting Castillian Bishop. It sums up the Ussuran opinion of the Castillians quite nicely.\n\nEisen: “There is something wrong with the land,” is the general consensus among Ussurans on Eisen. Since they tend to equate a people’s land with the people themselves, the Ussurans keep a careful watch on any Eisen they meet, half-convinced that he could go mad.\n\nMontaigne: Ussurans have nothing but contempt for the Montaigne nobles. The use of Porté near an Ussuran causes him physical pain, and the Montaignes’ callous disregard for others disgusts him.\n\nPirate Nations: Ussurans are unbothered by pirates. The only fleet Ussura has is a fishing fleet that sails on the Bay.\n\nSarmatian Commonwealth: A dangerous, backward, progressive, superstitious, overly pious gathering of conflicting ideals. Best to avoid them. Anyone clever enough to trick a demon is clever enough to trick you.\n\nVestenmennavenjar: The Ussurans are very pleased with their relationship with the Vendel League. Through their interactions with the League, they have been able to acquire so many new things, such as steel and spices."
