Shrayer, Klavdia Smola\n\nThis volume celebrates the literary oeuvres of David Shrayer-Petrov (Давид Шраер-Петров)—poet, fiction writer, memoirist, playwright, essayist, and literary translator (and medical doctor and researcher in his parallel career). David Shrayer-Petrov is one of the most important representatives of the Jewish-Russian literature that gained its shape and form during the post-Stalin years, developed in both officially sanctioned and underground conditions, subsequently emigrated from the USSR along with its creators, and is presently dispersed across many countries and five continents. A product of three historical epochs and a bearer of three dimensions— Soviet, émigré, and transnational—Jewish-Russian culture has transcended national boundaries. Once vibrantly alive, it is starting its descent into the depths of history and memory. This is why the task of studying and documenting its rich and diverse legacy has become especially urgent today. Published in the year of David Shrayer-Petrov’s eighty-fifth birthday, almost thirty-five years after the writer’s emigration from the former USSR, this is the first volume to gather materials and investigations that examine his writings from various literary-historical and theoretical perspectives. By focusing on many different aspects of Shrayer-Petrov’s multifaceted and eventful literary career, the volume brings together some of the leading * Copyright © 2021 by Roman Katsman, Maxim D. Shrayer, Klavdia Smola.\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nAmerican, European, Israeli, and Russian scholars of Jewish poetics, exilic literature, and Russian and Soviet culture and history. * * * Born on January 28, 1936 in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), David ShrayerPetrov entered the Soviet literary scene in the late 1950s as a poet and translator. He published a collection of poetry, many literary translations, and two books of essays in the 1960s and 1970s. Exploration of Jewish themes put Shrayer-Petrov in conflict with the Soviet authorities, limiting publication of his work and prompting him to emigrate. A Jewish refusenik in 1979–1987, Shrayer-Petrov lived as an outcast in his native country but continued to write prolifically, despite expulsion from the Union of Soviet Writers and persecution by the KGB. “Jews and Russians are the two peoples . . . closest to me in flesh (genes) and spirit (language),”2 Shrayer-Petrov wrote in early 1986, less than two years before emigrating from Russia. He was finally allowed to emigrate in 1987, settling in the United States. Since emigrating, Shrayer-Petrov has published ten books of poetry, ten novels, six collections of short stories, two plays, and four volumes of memoirs. He is best known for the trilogy of novels about refuseniks and the exodus of Jews from the USSR. The English translation of Doctor Levitin, the first part of the trilogy, was published in 2018. In a 2014 interview, Shrayer-Petrov commented on his experience as an immigrant writer: “Most of my recent stories fashion Russian— Jewish-Russian—characters living in America. In this sense, I’ve become an American writer. . . . I think that I’ve rooted myself in New England. It has become my second—now my main—habitat.”3 * * * Our volume consists of four sections and an addendum. Essays in the first section offer overarching views of David Shrayer-Petrov’s life and works. Klavdia Smola considers the question of the writer’s place in Jewish-Russian 2 David Shraer-Petrov, Druz´ia i teni. Roman s uchastiem avtora (New York: Liberty Publishing House, 1989), 9. 3 Maxim D. Shrayer and David Shrayer-Petrov, “Dinner with Stalin: A 3-Part Conversation with David Shrayer-Petrov,” Jewish Book Council / My Jewish Learning, July 8–10, 2014, https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/pb-daily/crypto-jews-and-autobiographicalanimals-part-3-of-a-3-part-conversation.\n\nPreface\n\nculture, Roman Katsman analyzes the distinct features of Shrayer-Petrov’s poetics in the context of late Soviet artistic nonconformism, while Maxim D. Shrayer offers a panoramic view of the writer’s literary biography in dialogue with Jewish, Russian and American exilic literature. The second section gathers together studies of David Shrayer-Petrov’s poetry. Ian Probstein casts a long glance at Shrayer-Petrov’s collections and cycles of poetry, written both in Russia and in America, while also identifying leitmotifs and prosodic trends. In his “notes in the margins,” Oleg Smola regards such key terms of Shrayer-Petrov’s poetry as fate and destiny, Jewishness, and Russianness, as well as his (neo-)futurist poetics and love lyric. Stefano Garzonio devotes his essay to the Italian themes and motifs in Shrayer-Petrov’s poetic oeuvres. Andrei Ranchin contributes a detailed reading and analysis of one poem, thereby delving deep into Shrayer-Petrov’s poetic laboratory. Finally, Evgeny Ermolin investigates one of the central literary-biographical lifelines in Shrayer-Petrov’s career—his friendship with the “avant-garde classic” Genrikh Sapgir. The third section of the volume focuses its attention on the refusenik trilogy, which has brought Shrayer-Petrov the most recognition. Klavdia Smola examines Shrayer-Petrov’s writings in the context of the Jewish renaissance and the “aliyah literature” of the late Soviet period. Joshua Rubenstein zooms in on the theme of Jewish revenge as a psychocultural phenomenon in Shrayer-Petrov’s refusenik fiction. Brian J. Horowitz considers the interrelationship of the author and his protagonist in Doctor Levitin—the first part of the refusenik trilogy. In her essay, Monica Osborne reads the novel as a reflection of the changing Jewish identity and of the relations between the Jewish community and power—both in the USSR of the late 1970s and early 1980s and in the present-day diaspora. Essays, collected in the volume’s fourth section, contribute to the study of Shrayer-Petrov’s artistic prose. Marat Grinberg leans upon the figure of the writer “Grifanov” in Shrayer-Petrov’s refusenik trilogy and draws far-reaching parallels between the writings of David Shrayer-Petrov and Yuri Trifonov. Leonid Katsis pursues various textual and cultural sources of Shrayer-Petrov’s historical novel Yudin’s Redemption, and in doing so unearths evidence of the spiritual quest that was characteristic of Soviet Jewish intelligentsia of the late Soviet period. Boris Lanin anatomizes the novella “Dinner with Stalin”—one of Shrayer-Petrov’s best known works of short fiction—and also steeps it in the context of Russian-language prose, both Soviet and émigré, about the mythologization of Stalin.\n\nix\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nThe four sections of this volume reflect some, albeit not all, of the principal vectors of David Shrayer-Petrov’s creativity. It is our hope that this book will serve as a catalyst for further study of his life and work. The addendum (Post Scriptum) is comprised of materials that could serve as a foundation for further study. Those include a long conversation with Maxim D. Shrayer, which raises a number of new and relevant questions, many of them related to the writer’s “Jewish secret.” The addendum also includes a curated pictorial biography, which highlights David ShrayerPetrov’s literary and professional formation and development. A detailed bibliography of the writer’s publications concludes the volume.

Exceptions are Russian words and geographical and personal names that have gained a common spelling in English, such as Joseph Brodsky instead of “Iosif Brodskii,” Osip Mandelstam instead of “Osip Mandelshtam,” Vladimir Jabotinsky instead of “Vladimir Zhabotinsky,” Babi Yar instead of “Babii Iar,” and so forth. Bibliographical references, including authors’ names and titles of Russian-language periodicals, in the footnotes and the bibliography are rendered in the standard Library of Congress system of transliterating the Russian alphabet, without diacritical marks.\n\nPart One\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer * Klavdia Smola\n\nIn 2021, David Shrayer-Petrov, poet, fiction writer, and memoirist, physician and medical scientist, former refusenik, turns eighty-five. Among the Russian-Jewish intelligentsia, Shrayer-Petrov had already become a legend: a man who, having experienced and described the history of the Jewish aliyah movement in the Soviet Union, became one of the most outstanding chroniclers of the late Soviet period and of the Jewish-Soviet diaspora. Shrayer-Petrov has been a medical scientist for most of his professional career, both in Russia and in America; he made some notable scientific discoveries in the fields of microbiology and cancer research.1 Like one of his favorite authors, Anton Chekhov, with whom he carries on a creative dialogue in many of his texts (see Maxim D. Shrayer’s essay in this volume), for many years Shrayer-Petrov worked as a practicing physician.2 For students of Slavic literature and for those studying Jewish history and\n\nCopyright © 2021 by Klavdia Smola.

Until quite recently, his creative and academic biography, many of his texts, and his role in the intellectual history of Russian Jewry and Russian culture as a whole have not received sufficient attention. David Shrayer-Petrov’s writings await further investigation. This essay—and this entire volume— seeks to close the gap while offering directions for further study. “I feel that I am an American, a Russian writer, and a Jew, that is, three hypostases are now already conjoined within me: America, my Jewishness, and, of course, Russia, because language is the only weapon a writer has at his disposal,” said Shrayer-Petrov in January 2016 during an interview with the St. Petersburg poet Tatyana Voltskaya on Radio Liberty (Radio Svoboda).3 The question of the writer’s identity that this self-characterization leads us to think about is as complex and, at the same time, as simple as it is for many writers of the transnational Jewish diaspora, going back to the period of the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment) in Europe and the rise of Jewish assimilation. In many instances, it is precisely in artistic texts that this identity is best manifested through the syncretism of various cultural traditions at the level of imagery, style, themes, and authorial perspective. Toward the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century—the time of Shrayer-Petrov’s adolescence and youth—the process of the Russification and Sovietization of Jews had been effectively accomplished.4 At the same time, the awareness of their nationality by Soviet Jews—and the re-acquisition of ethnic knowledge that in many cases was already absent— was a symptom not so much of the cultural as of the political climate of the late Stalin years. Like many of his peers, Shrayer-Petrov experienced the state and popular antisemitism of the Stalinist and post-Stalinist period. 3 David Shraer-Petrov and Tat´iana Vol´tskaia, “Mertsanie zheltoi zvezdy,” Radio Liberty, January 28, 2016, http://www.bigbook.ru/articles/detail.php?ID=25001, accessed June 3, 2020. 4 Cf.

Zvi Gitelman, Musya Glants, and Marshall I. Goldman (Bloomington-Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2003), 27–45.\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer\n\nIn his autobiographical prose, notably in the short novel Strange Danya Rayev (Strannyi Dania Raev),5 he frequently depicts this reawakening—a forcible reminder of the young Jewish protagonist’s own descent. In the novel’s first chapter, from the mouth of Dodonov, formerly a frontline soldier and now a local law-enforcement officer in the Uralian village where Danya and his mother had been evacuated from the besieged Leningrad, the seven-year-old Jewish boy hears a typical set of insults and insinuations aimed at an elderly evacuee (actually a Karaite whom Dodonov presumed, based on phenotypical characteristics, to be a Jew): “Понаехали сюда горбоносые да картавые и свои порядки устанавливают. Я кровь рабоче-крестьянскую проливал, а вы, гады ползучие, по тылам отсиживаетесь. [. . .] Видишь, Владимировна, за какую мразь мы с немцем воюем” (“All of you hooked noses, you can’t even roll your r’s properly, and now you’ve descended on us and try to install your way of life. I spilled my peasant-worker's blood for the Motherland, while you, creeping reptiles, were lounging around behind the lines. [. . .] See, Vladimirovna, what scum we defend from the Germans?”6). Judging by much evidence of this kind, the Jewishness of David Shrayer-Petrov and his texts was both nourished and reinforced against the backdrop of the Soviet discrimination. This connects him to a broad range of Russian-Jewish writers born in the 1930s and 1940s and their stories about a Jewish childhood in the Soviet Union: Aleksandr Melikhov, Mark Zaichik, David Markish, Izrail Metter, Yulia Shmukler, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Yury Karabchievsky, and Boris Khazanov (penname of Gennady Faibusovich), to name a few. Both Jewish ethnic renaissance and the struggle for repatriation to Israel (aliyah), which began in the second half of the 1960s, stemmed from these experiences: a negatively formed Jewish identity, fomented by antisemitism, turns into one of the strongest emancipatory, anti-assimilationist movements of ethnic minorities in Russian and Soviet history—indeed, into one of the most interesting phenomena of the European cultural and political underground. Like Eli Lyuksemburg, Efrem Baukh, or Felix Kandel, Shrayer-Petrov becomes 5 David Shraer-Petrov, Strannyi Dania Raev, in Eti strannye russkie evrei (Moscow: Raduga, 2004), 5–92; English translation, David Shrayer-Petrov, Strange Danya Rayev, tr.

Thus the novel Doctor Levitin (Doktor Levitin, 1979–1980), the first part of the refusenik trilogy and an exemplary work of Russian prose of the second half of the twentieth century, draws its imagery (albeit in a pointillistic fashion) from the many centuries of Judaic culture while at the same time tapping into the traditions of the world literature of Zionism. Shrayer-Petrov’s biography offers keys to some aspects of his poetics and the circle of his literary interests, which come vibrantly alive in his literary memoirs of Leningrad and Moscow,7 in the scientific memoir Hunt for the Red Devil (Okhota na ryzhego d´iavola, 2010). Some information about Shrayer-Petrov’s biography and creativity can also be gathered from his essays dispersed across collections of his works and anthologies or still uncollected. Finally, and insofar as a writer’s life may be read through the prism of his poetry, some of Shrayer-Petrov’s shorter and longer lyrical poems with Jewish and Judaic themes, such as “My Slavic Soul” (“Moia slavianskaia dusha,” 1975) and Villa Borghese (1987–1990), or longer narrative poems, such as Flying Saucers (Letaiushchie tarelki, 1981) and Runner Begoon (Begun, 1987), offer powerful interpretive tools for an interdisciplinary study of his life and art. Shrayer-Petrov’s literary debut was connected with his studies in medical school: “I met the future outstanding film director Ilya Averbakh. And together with him and Vasya [Vasily] Aksyonov, we founded a literary seminar. Later it became the literary seminar at the Palace of Culture of Industrial Cooperation (lito Promkooperatsii, or Promka), frequented by such future important writers as [Evgeny] Reyn, [Sergei] Volf, [Dmitry] Bobyshev, [Anatoly] Nayman, [Aleksandr] Kushner, [Mikhail] Eremin, and [Viktor] Sosnora.”8 Shrayer-Petrov organically entered the cohort of young Leningrad poets of the late 1950s and early 1960s, who sought to resurrect the Petersburg school of the Silver Age while also capitalizing on the great accomplishments of early Soviet poetry. Like other poets of the postwar Soviet period, very often of Jewish heritage, who existed entirely or partially in the space of unsanctioned culture, in the 1960s and the 7 David Shraer-Petrov, Druz´ia i teni.

In 1967 some of his earlier poems were collected in Canvasses (Kholsty), the only book of poetry he would publish in the Soviet Union.10 In his literary publications of the Soviet 1950s–1970s, the writer used a Russianized penname, David Petrov, which the authorities often pressured him to shorten to “D. Petrov,” so as to obliterate the non-Russian, and likely Jewish, first name. Before emigrating to the United States in 1987 with his family—his wife Emilia and son Maxim—the writer spent over eight years as a refusenik. The conflict with the regime began with Shrayer-Petrov’s decision to read his poems with Jewish themes in public. “I suddenly understood that, of course, I was obligated to write about Jews. This is the main line of my life. Who if not I?” he stated in a 2011 interview.11 Shrayer-Petrov’s living testimony of the scope of the Jewish movement and of the punitive actions taken by the Soviet authorities contradicts the fairly widespread opinion (including on the part of some Western historians) about the relative insignificance of the refusenik community and the alleged elitism of the interests of the participants in the Soviet aliyah movement: It was a lesser form of genocide [malyi genotsid; малый геноцид] that the Soviet authorities committed. In Moscow alone there were fifty thousand Jewish refuseniks, and moreover, which is the most important thing, they for the most part let people with [less education or blue collar workers] and filtered out and mostly kept as refuseniks the intelligentsia. And the intelligentsia was being degraded. For example, I know that one Artist of Merit of the Russian Federation, a violinist, his name escapes me now, worked as a custodian in an underpass on Smolenskaya Square.\n\n9 On the phenomenon of Jewish translators during the Soviet period, see the novels Stop the Plane—I’m Getting Off! (Ostanovite samolet—ia slezu!) by Efraim Sevela (1975), A Certain Finkelmeyer (Nekto Finkel´maier) by Felix Roziner (1975), and Decade (Dekada) by Semyon Lipkin (1980). 10 David Petrov, Kholsty, poetry collection published as part of the collective volume Pereklichka (Moscow: Molodaia gvardiia, 1967), 116–160. 11 Shraer-Petrov and Katsov, “Ia dumaiu, chto my vse drug druga chemu-to nauchili. . . ..”\n\n7\n\n8\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\nThere was a plethora of such examples; all of our friends essentially worked as manual laborers, electricians, boiler-room attendants, although these were doctors, engineers, and so forth. Although doctors had it a little easier in that I went from being a “senior research investigator” down to the position of a rank-and-file physician, but at least I was working, this was my profession, while very many suffered. During the time we were refuseniks, our whole family started intersecting very rigorously with such activists as Slepak, Begun, and others. [The authorities] warned me many times, snatched up and arrested me several times, took me in to the station, conducted intimidating interrogations, and so on and so forth. It culminated in essence with a trial that was publicly staged by the newspaper Arguments and Facts, in which a lengthy article appeared [. . .]. They sent me subpoenas to the prosecutor’s office. I decided I would not go. As a result I ended up in the hospital; I collapsed with a heart attack, after which [the persecution campaign] suddenly went away. They left me alone.12\n\nDespite the injustice and suffering, the experience of being a refusenik, the expulsion from the Union of Soviet Writers and the persecution by the authorities became a powerful creative impulse, which fueled many of Shrayer-Petrov’s works composed not only before but also after emigration, and led him to identify himself as a refusenik writer. We should note that the style, artistic texture, and intellectual basis of Shrayer-Petrov’s writings were formed in his pre-emigration period and subsequently enriched in the United States—above all, by his experience of the life and anxieties of Russian Jews abroad, especially in America. In this sense, Shrayer-Petrov is specifically an émigré and exilic writer and not a representative of the newer Russian-Jewish literature, transnational in spirit, problematics, and geography, which gives evidence of the open and polyvalent identity of the young authors of Russian-Jewish (or SovietJewish) origin who not infrequently write in two languages. This is not surprising if one takes into account that Shrayer-Petrov, born in 1936, left for the West in 1987 at the age of fifty-one. By that time, he had already created a large corpus of lyrical and narrative poetry, his main novels (the first two parts of his refusenik trilogy, which I examine in a separate essay in this volume) as well as a memoir, a body of short stories, nonfiction, and literary criticism. During his Russian (Soviet) decades he had imbibed the 12 Shraer-Petrov and Katsov, “Ia dumaiu, chto my vse drug druga chemu-to nauchili . . .” (transcription errors in the publication have been corrected in the English translation).\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer\n\nunique multi-layered atmosphere of Jewish culture in late Soviet Russia with its exceptional hybridity, its (anti-)Soviet Jewish self-awareness, with the memory of the Shoah that had been suppressed by the authorities, and with the official obfuscation of various historical stages of Soviet antisemitism. Moreover, prior to emigration Shrayer-Petrov had reflected intensively on the cultural and political Zionism of aliyah, his attitude to which appears ambiguous. Finally, still prior to becoming an émigré and an immigrant, Shrayer-Petrov had already displayed a double stylistic and intertextual orientation—both towards Russian and towards Western European and American literature. However, the question of the possible development of Shrayer-Petrov’s poetics compared to other Jewish writers of this same generation who live or have lived in the United States, Canada, Germany, and other countries outside Russia (such as Grigory Svirsky or Friedrich Gorenstein) calls for a separate investigation. During his American years, Shrayer-Petrov has published more than twenty books. While publishing his pre-emigration poetry and prose, some of it revamped and revised, he has created a large body of new shorter and longer poems, short stories and novellas, novels, literary memoirs, as well as essays and criticism (see Shrayer-Petrov’s Bibliography in this volume). To date, four books of his fiction have appeared in English, edited and co-translated by his son, Maxim D. Shrayer, a literary scholar and author in his own right; among Shrayer-Petrov’s translators, his wife of over fifty-five years, Emilia Shrayer, deserves a special mention. In collaboration with his son, Shrayer-Petrov wrote the first book monograph about the leading poet of the postwar avantgarde, Genrikh Sapgir, with whom the writer was close for many years.13 Of the works of fiction written by Shrayer-Petrov in the United States, I have a special appreciation for the two novels Strange Danya Rayev (Strannyi Dania Raev, 2001) and Savely Ronkin (Savelii Ronkin, 2004) published under the same cover in the volume These Strange Russian Jews (Eti strannye russkie evrei, 2004), as well as some of the short stories and novellas included in the collection Carp for the Gefilte Fish (Karp dlia farshirovannoi ryby, 2005). Shrayer-Petrov’s selected works of shorter fiction 13 Maksim D. Shraer and David Shraer-Petrov, Genrikh Sapgir: Klassik avangarda (St. Petersburg: Dmitrii Bulanin, 2004). Two more editions have since appeared. ShrayerPetrov and Shrayer also edited the first academic edition of Genrikh Sapgir’s poetry, published in 2004 by the “New Poet’s Library” series; see Genrikh Sapgir, Stikhotvoreniia i poemy, ed., introduction, and commentary by Maksim D. Shraer and David Shraer-Petrov, Novaia biblioteka poeta, Malaia seriia (St. Petersburg: Akademicheskii proekt, 2004).\n\n9\n\n10\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\nwere subsequently reprinted in the volume Round-the-Globe Happiness (Krugosvetnoe schast´e), published in Moscow in 2016. As a work of autobiographical fiction, Strange Danya Rayev encompasses the prewar childhood years of the main character in Leningrad and the wartime years spent in evacuation in a remote village in the Northern Ural region. The short novel culminates with the hero’s return to Leningrad in 1944 and ends in the summer of 1945 following the defeat of Nazi Germany. The artful simplicity and organicism of this novel’s language, the deliberate choice of recollected and narrated impressions and experiences, and the humor and quaintness characteristic of “infantile” storytelling reveal a kinship not only with classical works about children by Lev Tolstoy (Detstvo [Boyhood, 1852]) or Anton Chekhov (such as “Grisha,” 1886), but also with the Sovietand post-Soviet-era works by such writers as Anatoly Pristavkin (Nochevala tuchka zolotaia [A Golden Cloud Spent the Night, 1987]) or Aleksandr Chudakov (the novel A Gloom Is Cast upon the Ancient Steps [Lozhitsia mgla na starye stupeni, 2012]). As in the best examples of literature about childhood, the limited scope and the estrangement of the child’s perception paradoxically give the most accurate portrait of a historical period. A vibrant picture emerges first of prewar life in Leningrad and of the Uralian village during the war. Shrayer-Petrov’s narrator converts the memories into an artistic narrative—an adult’s correlation of facts is woven into the poetics of a child’s perspective: short sentences, the present tense (the time of the hero’s outlook) interlaced with the past tense, the concreteness of the optics, the gradually expanding space of perception: Помню деда Вульфа. Он старый. У него белая борода. Он почему-то в полушубке. Значит была зима? Да, зима. Он сидит у окна кухни. За окном улица. Сугробы. Крыши деревянных домов покрыты снегом. Дым идёт из бурых кирпичных труб. Я сижу на коленях у деда Вульфа. Он кормит меня сладкой булкой и дает запивать молоком из кружки. «Это Полоцк, сынок, — говорит дед Вульф. — А когда-то мы жили в золотой Литве, в Шауляе». Из маминых рассказов я знаю, что дедушка Вульф, бабушка Ева, мамины сестры Ривочка и Маня, брат Митя и моя мама бежали из Литвы от белополяков. Поляки убили Ривочку. Бабушка Ева умерла от горя и от тифа. Дедушка с остальными детьми поселился в Полоцке. Он стал учителем еврейского языка. Тогда в Белоруссии ещё были еврейские школы.14 14 Shraer-Petrov, Strannyi Dania Raev, 17.\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer\n\nI do remember Grandpa Wolf. He’s old. He has a white beard. For some reason he’s wearing a sheepskin jacket. Does that mean it was winter? Yes, winter. He’s sitting by the kitchen window. You can see the street through the window. Snow drifts. The roofs of the wooden houses are covered in snow. Smoke billows out of sooty-brown, brick chimneys. I’m sitting on Grandpa Wolf ’s lap. He’s feeding me a sweet roll and milk from a mug. “This is Polotsk, son,” says Grandpa Wolf. “But there was a time when we lived in golden Lithuania, in Shavel.” From what mama told me, I know that Grandpa Wolf, Grandma Eva, mama’s sisters Rivochka and Manya, brother Mitya and my mother ran away from Lithuania fleeing the White Poles. The Poles killed Rivochka. Grandma Eva died from sorrow and typhus. Grandpa settled in Polotsk with the rest of the children. He used to be a rabbi. He became a teacher in a Jewish school. At that time there were still Jewish schools in Belarus.15\n\nThe reaction of an urban child to the everyday language of the Uralian village causes something of culture clash:\n\n— Меня зовут Пашка, — говорит мне подросток. —А тебя? — А меня Даник, — отвечаю я. — А это моя мама, Стэлла Владимировна. — Мудрёно! — изумляется Пашка. — Вы кто будете? — Ленинградцы! —с гордостью и даже с хвастовством говорю я. — А люди бают «выковыренные»! Не вдруг осознаю, что баять значит «говорить». А «выковыренные» — искажённое слово эвакуированные. Пашка станет моим старшим товарищем и учителем деревенской жизни. Мама между тем начинает переносить вещи в избу. Ей помогает пожилая тётенька, Елена Матвеевна. Мне Елена Матвеевна велит называть её: баба Лена. Она — хозяйка избы. Андрей Михеевич, которого я буду называть дед Андрей, её муж. Пашка их сын. Через некоторое время хозяева начинают называть маму: Владимировна, а она их: Матвеевна и Михеич. 16 “My name is Pashka,” says the teenager. “And you?” “And my name is Danik,” I answer. “And this is my mother, Stella Vladimirovna.” 15 Shrayer-Petrov, Autumn in Yalta, 13. 16 Shraer-Petrov, Strannyi Dania Raev, 24.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\n“That’s a hard one!” Pashka says in amazement. “So, who would you be?” “We’re from Leningrad!” I say with pride and even with some boasting. “And they say you’re the vacated ones!” I don’t immediately get it that “vacated” is a distortion of the word “evacuated.” Pashka is to become my older friend and teacher of village life. In the meantime mama begins to bring our things inside the izba. An older woman, Elena Matveevna, helps her. Elena Matveevna tells me to call her Baba (Grandma) Lena. She’s the owner of the izba. Andrey Mikheich, whom I will call Ded (Grandpa) Andrey, is her husband. Pashka is their son. In time these hosts start to refer to mama as Vladimirovna and she calls them Matveevna and Mikheich—by patronymic, after the village fashion. 17\n\nHere the Russian peasant milieu meets Russian-Jewish urban culture, or, to augment the sociological aspects of the story, the Russian folk culture interacts with the culture of the intelligentsia. (David Markish depicts something similar in the early autobiographical novel Story Embellishment [Priskazka, 1971].) Unlike the neighbors in his building in Leningrad, where Danya lives with his parents before the war, his host family—the Terekhins—show not a shadow of Judeophobia. Instead, the evacuated Jews experience human all-inclusiveness. It was no accident that during these wartime years spent in evacuation Danya forgets about his Jewishness and becomes a part of the ethnic Russian and the Orthodox Christian communities. He celebrates Shrovetide, Easter, Trinity Sunday, Nicholas’s Day, and Christmas along with his host family. It is true that the narrator notes that the Terekhins have a vague idea of the identity of their tenants and guilelessly propose that Danya and his mother get a pig—which they do, so as not to die of hunger: И вот наш собственный поросёнок Нюф хрюкает в сарайчике и, чавкая, нетерпеливо лопает вареную и толчёную с крапивой и лебедой картошку. А там и два гуся, переваливаясь, шагают под моей неусыпной заботой на луг к речке и обратно. У нас с мамой большое хозяйство: огород, поросёнок, гуси. Мы совсем деревенские. And here we have our very own piglet, Fifer, snorting in the shed, and smacking with impatience, devouring potatoes boiled and mashed with 17 Shrayer-Petrov, Autumn in Yalta, 20–21.\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer\n\nnettle and goosefoot. And also we have two geese, waddling and walking back and forth between the meadow and the river, under my unremitting care. Mama and I have a large dominion: a garden, a piglet, geese. We are real villagers.18\n\nDanya reads Russian folk tales and later short novels by Pushkin, Gogol, and Kuprin, but also such masterpieces of Soviet literature for the adolescents as Lev Kassil’s Konduit and Shvambrania (1931) and Yury Tynyanov’s Kyukhlya (1925). And he is ashamed of the fact that Yiddish, which his great-aunt Tyotya Enya tells him about, resembles the language of Germans—of the enemy. Adroitly and unpretentiously, Shrayer-Petrov shows the conflagration of the various shades and nuances forming the unique, heterogeneous environment for the “newcomer” Jews into the Russian provinces of the 1940s: the folk cosmopolitism of Grandpa Andrey and Grandma Lena; the assimilation of the child from a Jewish family with an already “thin”19 ethnic affiliation. At the same time, the novel depicts Danya’s lively interaction with the members of his own meshpocha; the everyday antisemitism of local rural authorities (see above about law enforcement officer Dodonov). Meanwhile, Shrayer-Petrov underscores the syncretism of the primordial Russian culture itself: the men are fighting at the war front, while their families, celebrating the victory at Stalingrad, are praying and crossing themselves before the icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, some of them out of faith, others out of habit.20 In Leningrad, his dying grandfather gives Danya Chanukah gelt, while in another episode Danya’s family celebrates Shabbat and buries a relative according to Jewish rites. This syncretism, the variety of traditions set against the background of Communist (half-)taboos, the young Jewish boy’s absorption of this essentially contradictory reality, is testimony to ShrayerPetrov’s unique art of the literary and factographical storytelling. Strange Danya Rayev is an example of the artistic-documentary writing characteristic of the majority of Shrayer-Petrov’s literary texts. But in terms of the genealogy of the “strange,” hybrid Soviet Jewry, perhaps the most interesting feature of Shrayer-Petrov’s fiction is the countering of all attempts at essentializing the concept of ethnic culture. Among all else, his 18 Shraer-Petrov, Strannyi Dania Raev, 36–37; Shrayer-Petrov, Autumn in Yalta, 36. 19 Mikhail Krutikov, “The Jewish Future in Russia: Trends and Opportunities,” East European Jewish Affairs 1 (2002): 5. 20 Shraer-Petrov, Strannyi Dania Raev, 62.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\nwritings, both prose and poetry, capture the naissance of the image of the Jew of the late Soviet type, one who has grown up with a fragmentary memory and knowledge of Jewish customs and of Yiddish, with a grandfather or grandmother who still carries on the tradition, and with a powerful experience of antisemitism (this is also the case with the characters of Yury Karabchievsky, Aleksandr Melikhov, and other Russian-Jewish writers born in the 1930s and 1940s). Shrayer-Petrov admitted that in the 1970s he wanted to write “about those Jews who still existed, not Sholem Aleichem types, schlimazels, but about the real Jewish intelligentsia.”21 The juxtaposition of the “folkloric” Jews of Sholem Aleichem and the “real” Soviet ones is significant as a marker of the writer’s simultaneous self-identification and self-distancing. To begin with, the somewhat stereotypical portrait of the “classic” literary Jew betrays a certain limitedness of the Jewish literary education in late Soviet times, this also being true of Shrayer-Petrov’s target reader. But much more important is the perceived difference between the Jew of the Imperial Russian past (essentially unknown and unknowable to the majority) and the Jew of the present—the Russian (Soviet) intellectual with a self-awareness that is totally unlike that of Tevye the Dairyman but, conversely, rather like that of Lev Odoevtsev, protagonist of the celebrated novel Pushkin House (1878) by Shrayer-Petrov’s close contemporary and fellow Leningradian Andrey Bitov. Moreover, striving to avoid the widespread Soviet stereotype of the “weak” Jews who genealogically belong to the ranks of well-known schlimazels and schlemiels, the writers of the aliyah drew inspiration from completely different sources. Their Jewish characters are not comic and often heroic and tragic, based on the biblical figures. (Here the exception is Efraim Sevela, who, after the fashion of Ilya Ehrenburg’s Lazik of the Stormy Life of Lazik Roitschwantz, transferred the image of the schlimazel from Yiddish culture onto the Soviet present.) After he became an émigré and an American, Shrayer-Petrov created the figure of a Jewish intellectual with qualities of the schlimazel in the novel Savely Ronkin (2004), which was a contender for the 2004 Russian Booker Prize. In terms of genre, Savely Ronkin conflates elements of immigrant fiction, adventure-erotic belle-lettres, and literary memoirs. It is a hybrid novel, simultaneously an engaging, often even piquant, and intellectually demanding. A chronicle of the everyday lives of young Russian bohemians in America, it combines features of a psychological, confessional narrative 21 Shraer-Petrov and Katsov, “Ia dumaiu, chto my vse drug druga chemu-to nauchili. . . .”\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer\n\nand literary-critical reflections. The novel, which can be read in one breath, derives its captivating quality in no small part from the creative alternation of setting and scenery: in the novel’s pages, the late Soviet literary bohemian milieu in the restaurant of the Central House of Writers (TsDL) is succeeded by the lush décor of the suburban house of Paul and Sabina Rothman on Cape Cod; Genrikh Sapgir’s dacha outside Moscow is counterbalanced by Boston apartments; Moscow streets neighbor American beaches. In Savely Ronkin and elsewhere, Shrayer-Petrov brings together elements that may strike one as not compatible. This artistic syntheticism is typical of ShrayerPetrov, a writer who is not afraid of heterogeneous storylines that span various tiers of narration. The poet Savely Ronkin emigrates to the United States along with his wife, Wanda, and her close friend (and cousin) Sabina, who obtains a visa by marrying the millionaire financier Paul Rothman, a passionate admirer of Russian literature and a generous patron of Russian underground poets. The amorous relations of the heroes are complicated because the two women are connected by an erotic relationship, and Savely not only has to reconcile himself to this but is himself drawn into the sexual orbits of the two women. The talented Russian-American translator Greta Dimer is Englishing Savely’s poems. At the same time, she is, apparently, an intimate friend of Paul Rothman. As the plot progresses, she becomes a temporary wife of the expatriate poet Gorokhovsky, whose works she also translates and whom she most certainly idolizes. Savely both likes and envies his friend, the genius Gorokhovsky, who is gradually becoming famous both in emigration and in Russia and receives a Pulitzer Prize. Known in literary circles so far “only” as a poet-translator, Ronkin suffers from his own lack of success and nurtures the cherished thought of publishing a collection of poems, which indeed comes out at the end of the novel under the title Waves. Ronkin starts to feel more and more hatred toward the benevolent, practical, and at the same time slightly starry-eyed Paul Rothman. Most of all, Ronkin abhors his own material dependence and creative inferiority. As a tormented, insecure, addicted poet, he feels some primal alienation from the successful educated banker who knows no want. Notable is Paul’s characterization—a stereotypical portrait of an American, which deserves a place of honor in the Russian writers’ gallery of different national images (the dumb German in Chekhov, the frivolous Frenchman in Tolstoy, the narrow-minded Pole in Dostoevsky, and so forth): “Now a bit about Paul Rothman’s smile. He was well-mannered. It was instilled in him\n\n15\n\n16\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\nsince childhood that it is natural to greet good events with a smile. And how it is also much more fitting to greet with a smile events or words that are dubious or even negative (a smile that is is circumspect, not mocking, sad, reproachful, or even sarcastic) rather than with an angry or distressed face.”22 Ronkin sometimes earns money by working at a car wash, and at one point he manages, thanks to Paul’s intercession and Gorokhovsky’s recommendation, to get a position as an academic associate in the Linguistics Department of Boston College, located in one of Boston’s suburbs. But his academic career soon ends because he goes on a drinking bender and loses his interest not only in work but in the external world altogether. Ronkin’s latest binge is triggered by the scandalous unsuccess of his new book, Memoirs of a Literary Horse, released by a Russian émigré publisher. With bitter sarcasm and a masterful eye for literary polemics, Shrayer-Petrov depicts the biased reaction of critics and “educated” émigré readers to the sometimes unflattering but essentially objective, or at least controversial, opinions and facts Ronkin divulged in his memoirs. The “partisanship” and aggressively amateurish judgments of the public, which in the novel likely stem from the author’s autobiographical experiences, are transmitted with particularly poignant irony in Savely’s dialogues with his fellow émigrés at a party. The physicians Mark and Nina Shuster are shocked by the close acquaintance of Ronkin with the “Stalinist” writer Konstantin Simonov; the mathematician Yuly Okun is insulted by the alleged “denigration” of the “Orthodox Jewish refusenik Tsukerman”;23 the former refusenik activist and dissident Volodya Gopak is distressed by Ronkin’s perceived sympathy for Muslims, whom Gopak considers enemies of the Jewish nation; and the host, Gena Gofman, is astounded that Ronkin does not consider the poet-songwriter Bulat Okudzhava to be a “great” poet.24 In an almost poster-like manner, like Goncharov’s succession of neighboring landowners in the beginning of Oblomov (1859), Shrayer-Petrov parades representatives of the émigré reading public in front of the reader. The cultural significance and historical veracity of the unacknowledged Jewish poet-translator who suffers from unemployment is validated by its serious literary genealogy, which includes Felix Roziner’s A Certain 22 David Shraer-Petrov, Savelii Ronkin, in his Eti stranye russkie evrei (Moscow: Raduga, 2004), 119. 23 The grotesque figure of the religious refusenik Tsukerman is depicted in ShrayerPetrov’s story “Tsukerman and His Children” ( Tsukerman i ego deti, 1989), in his Karp dlia farshirovannoi ryby. Rasskazy (Moscow: Raduga, 2006), 65–73. 24 Shraer-Petrov, Savelii Ronkin, 292–295.\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer\n\nFinkelmayer (Nekto Finkel’maier, 1975), Semyon Lipkin’s Decade (Dekada, 1980), and, to a degree, David Markish’s Dog (Pes, 1984). Only the last of these texts is about an émigré cultural space (Israel) and the narrowness of its publishing and readership politics. Along with Roziner and Lipkin, Shrayer-Petrov explores the topic of creative failure and creative secondariness of translation work, but does so in the post-Soviet period. Along with Markish, he connects the literary dots of Russia and the West in an rather unflattering manner. Yet, the publication of Ronkin’s book of poems at the end and his return to Russia augur a new beginning for him. Several individual fragments of Savely Ronkin are taken, in a modified form, from Shrayer-Petrov’s earlier texts. For example, the episode with Karaites in Trakai hearkens back to Doctor Levitin. The novel also reveals a literary kinship with Shrayer-Petrov’s literary memoirs (especially The Gold-Domed Moscow) and with his short stories. A version of the short story “The Old Writer Forman” (“Staryi pisatel´ Forman,” 1995) appears in Savely Ronkin as a text within a text. Tsukerman also appears as the title character in another of Shrayer-Petrov’s post-emigration stories. These connections bring us back to Shrayer-Petrov’s creativity as a writer of shorter fiction. David Shrayer-Petrov can justly be called a master of short fiction (“мастер рассказа”). His stories and novellas are characterized by everyday realism combined with elements of mysticism and surrealism; a poetic polysemy and semantics of subtexts; grotesquerie but also, simultaneously, precision and fullness of details; the development of the plot toward unexpected and contrasting endings. While Shrayer-Petrov’s short fiction touches upon some of the most complex and tragic themes— the Shoah, Jewish emigration, Jewish identity over the course of centuries of the diaspora, Judaism as a worldview—it is totally devoid of dogmatism or attempts to lead the reader by the hand. In several stories, dogmatism of views—especially Jewish dogmatism—forms an important theme. Shrayer-Petrov inherits from Chekhov the imaginative candor and openmindedness, as well as the soberly ironic portrayal of his misfit heroes— which Maxim D. Shrayer first observed in connection with Shrayer-Petrov’s story “Autumn in Yalta” (“Osen´ v Ialte,” 1992) and further explores in the essay included in this volume.25 Above all, Shrayer-Petrov’s stories 25 Maxim D. Shrayer, “Afterword: Voices of My Father’s Exile,” in David Shrayer-Petrov, Autumn in Yalta: A Novel and Three Stories, ed., co-tr., and with an afterword by Maxim D. Shrayer, Library of Modern Jewish Literature (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2006), 205–234.\n\n17\n\n18\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\nabunduntly illustrate the transformation of documentary writing into the artistic fabric of prose with its ambiguous appraisal of historical facts. Chekhov’s universal oneness and tragedy of existence, that in “Rothchild’s Fiddle” (“Skripka Rotshil’da,” 1894) opens up the path to mutual reconciliation and washes away the distinctions separating a Jew and a nonJew, also finds an embodiment in Shrayer-Petrov’s Russian-Jewish short fiction. The “ethnic” point of view and historical backdrop change, but the artistic philosophy remains. Shrayer-Petrov echoes Chekhov’s poetics of relegating ethnic or cultural conflict to the deep foundations of being, and explores these conflicts in his own time period in his stories and novellas. This is what happens in “Mimicry” (“Mimikriia,” 1996),26 in which the writer analyzes one of the themes central to his artistic universes—the theme of accommodation, self-concealment, and hyperassimilation of Jews in the diaspora. Mimicry is a concept whose many meanings ShrayerPetrov the natural scientist verifies on the human species, and the writerphilosopher transforms and converts to a symbol of human life. In the plot, the mimicry of chameleons and moths is studied by Michael Kaminski, an American academic of Jewish-Polish origin, and by his colleague, the émigré professor of biology Viktor Turkin, in whose New England home the characters socialize. “Mimicry” is also the name of the puppet theater organized by the professor’s wife, Rita; the puppets are archetypal reflections of the national types of different characters. The casual conversation of the guests about the dispersion and cultural influence of Jews in Europe first turns into a dispute and then devolves into an argument. Kaminski contends that the role of Jews in historical progress is greatly exaggerated, and Jews themselves, especially in Russia, have become something like a fashion (“Judeomania”). The narrator, a Russian Jew and an émigré himself, also participates in the discussion. He gets more and more annoyed, as he sees in Kaminski’s arguments a desire to disavow his own apparent Jewishness. The conversation moves to subjects that feel complicated to most of the guests: the genocide of the Armenians in Turkey (among the guests are a young Armenian woman, Astrid, a visiting historian at the local university, and a neurosurgeon of Turkish descent, Doctor Stephen Akhmet) and the complicity of the Eastern European populations in the Shoah. The conflict between the narrator and Kaminski the “chameleonologist,” made more acute by a love rivalry (they are both courting the beautiful Armenian 26 David Shraer-Petrov, “Mimikriia,” in his Karp dlia farshirovannoi ryby, 147–150.\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov, Russian-Jewish Writer\n\nwoman), turns the denouement into a kind of a duel. The whole group goes to a rocky New England beach, and, in spite of the upcoming bad weather, compete with each other in a swimming race. When Kaminski hits his head on a rocky reef, the narrator suddenly forgets about everything: “I completely forgot about Astrid, about the competition, about our arguments over lunch. Everything was erased by these mad waves that could kill a man.”27 As they manage to reach the shore, Kaminski scornfully admits that he was one of the children that the Germans “did not succeed” in incinerating in the gas chambers: “And forgive me my cynicism. That is probably also an attempt to wear a mask. Someone else’s mask.”28 The narrator attempts to understand himself, to find the root of his sudden hatred, as well as his writer’s rebelliousness, “the tooth-gnashing lines of my truth-seeking writings.”29 An episode from his Russian—Soviet—childhood emerges in his consciousness, offering both the motive and the solution; he leaves the recollection of the lack of solidarity among Jews where it lives in his memory—in the world of Judeophobia. As in many of Chekhov’s prose masterpieces—most articulately revealed in the short story “Enemies” (“Vragi,” 1887) and the novella “The Duel” (“Duel´,” 1891)—Shrayer-Petrov studies the enmity of ideas as a symptom of underlying psychological processes. In late Chekhov (and, one might add, in some of Nabokov’s short stories), the ideological conflict often resolves not by the characters’ insight but only by their departure from a previously unshakeable conviction. Their subjective pictures of the world change and become more complex, but the process of cognition remains uncompleted: “No one knows the real truth,” says Layevsky to von Koren in the denouement of “The Duel.” The conflict in “Mimicry” is similar but slightly different: the clash becomes a kind of therapy and leads to catharsis, to an inner liberation. In the story “Tsukerman and His Children” (1989), which caused something of a polemic in the Russian-Jewish communities of the United States and Israel,30 Shrayer-Petrov transplants the typical Chekhovian hero 27 Ibid., 147. 28 Ibid., 147. 29 Ibid., 149; Shrayer-Petrov, Jonah and Sarah: Jewish Stories of Russia and America, ed.

The refusenik Tsukerman is a bore and moralizer whose maladroitness is revealed on the level of human and family relations. “He was fanatically, fervently loyal to the letter of Judaism, I'm fantastically hapless in viscous conversations,”31 the autobiographical narrator explains. Shrayer-Petrov depicts the contemporary Jewish Pecheneg from the refusenik milieu (compare Chekhov’s story “Pecheneg,” 1897), the modern Doctor Lvov (compare Chekhov’s play Ivanov, 1887), the modern Belikov (compare Chekhov’s “A Man Encased” [“Chelovek v futliare,” 1898]) as various hypostases of the inwardly shriveled and cocooned, limited in his convictions, and also pathetic, inadequate bearer of an idea. Tsukerman judges the narrator for being a writer; literature, after all, draws one away from the only worthy source—the Bible. It seems strange in the face of such moral rigor that, when leaving for Israel with his family, Tsukerman leaves behind in Moscow the preteen daughter of his wife from her first marriage (the girl’s non-Jewish father, whom Tsukerman deems a “barbarian,” does not give his permission for her to leave). Shrayer-Petrov masterfully employs a system of (crooked, grotesque) portrait reflections—be it a boorish drunk or another “obsessed” Jew, Monya Kalman—for a multidimensional characterization of the human type. But Tsukerman’s most accurate mirror is his poor, misfortunate, inarticulate family. Here is the final scene at the airport: “On the other side of the turnstile stood Tsukerman’s wife, hardly recognizable in a thick black shawl concealing her head. Baby Samuil slept in the arms of Tsukerman’s wife. In one hand she clutched the handle of a green suitcase on wheels, and to the other Boris-Barukh had attached himself, playing choo-choo train.”32 This short essay cannot do justice to David Shrayer-Petrov’s rich and varied writings, as his creativity attracts increasing attention from researchers in Russia, the United States, Europe, and Israel.33 ShrayerPetrov’s oeuvres may be called a monument to Russian Jews of the transitional and, in a broader sense, syncretic cultural type—both Soviet 31 Shraer-Petrov, Karp dlia farshirovannoi ryby, 65; Shrayer-Petrov, Jonah and Sarah, 78 32 Tr.

This has partly to do with the fact that nonconformist literature has long since developed its own unofficial but fully hegemonic canon. On the other hand, this is related to the question of how the national, particularly the Jewish, component should be related to the discourse on Soviet nonconformism. The theoretical interpretation of the latter is far from completed, nor is the interpretation of the cultural-anthropological motifs at the foundation of nonconformist literature. This essay focuses on the writings of David Shrayer-Petrov, mostly those created while he was a refusenik.

Let us begin by examining the concept of nonconformism. Nonconformism may be described as a kind of homonym with diverse but similar meanings on the artistic, social, and socio-psychological planes. In sociology and rhetoric, nonconformism is reduced to protest and disagreement and is also sometimes included in manifestations of anarchism; it is, however, apparent that these concepts are not exhausted by each other. In its most general sense, nonconformism is understood as resistance to forms of thinking, writing, behavior, and so forth that are in effect and imposed by the authorities, the hegemony, or the government, but also by generally accepted opinions, stereotypes, and prejudices, that which is outside the mold, or, as Lidiya Ginzburg put it, “that which is dissimilar.”3 As regards Soviet literature, nonconformism becomes an even more opaque concept because the Soviet authorities, like no other, bestowed a huge significance on the adoption of any form, be it in the aesthetic or in the sociocultural sphere, thereby leaving no room outside the bounds of its scene of appropriation. Analyzed by Alexei Yurchak as one of the sociocultural possibilities of “late socialism,”4 the naïve fantasy of existing “outside” this scene cultivated in certain circles, from Thaw-era hipsters (Russian: “стиляги,” stiliagi) to Russian rock, could not be realized. Even those who were “simply” “creative people, not fitting into the system,” who “were not active soldiers but simply wanted to be left in peace and not prevented from self-expression,”5 inevitably turned out to be in conflict with the Soviet system.6\n\n2 Eric Gans, A New Way of Thinking: Generative Anthropology in Religion, Philosophy, Art (Aurora: The Davies Group, 2011). 3 Boris Ivanov, “Evoliutsiia literaturnykh dvizhenii v piatidesiatye–vos´midesiatye gody,” in Istoriia leningradskoi nepodtsenzurnoi literatury, 1950-e–1980-e, ed.

In this battle, an imagined, hypothetical, but at the same time tangible scene of conflict was created, in which the victim of the system (political or aesthetic) ceased to be a victim and became an active force—that is to say, historical consciousness stepped outside the boundaries of the victimary paradigm. The basic effort of being outside the mold was applied to a mutual symbolic recodification of the political, religious, social, metaphysical, folkloric, national, and other “forms.” This method was directed at blocking the gestures of appropriation and at deferring violence, which generated new signs and a new, nonconformist culture. Its rhetorical instrument was “fearless speech,”7 consisting of individual, sometimes minimalist and fragmented utterances. Such utterances embodied the essence of nonconformism: the transformation of helplessness and weakness into strength (aesthetic, cultural, and political) and the formation of a new identity outside the bounds of the victimary paradigm. When such utterances generate signs with a Jewish character, it makes sense to talk of a specifically Jewish component of nonconformism. Alek Rapoport wrote, “Being a nonconformist artist is already critical. Being at the same time also a ‘Jewish artist’ is a simply scandalous situation for the USSR.”8 Thus Joseph Brodsky develops the space of conflict formation outside the fence of a Jewish cemetery, mobilizing the readers of the samizdat publication Sintaksis in 1960 to the perception of “jurists, merchants, musicians, and revolutionaries” as idealists and interpreters of the Talmud—and their self-sacrifice, depicting them as a tenacious seed that has fallen into the soil.9 Natalia Ivanova wrote about the violation of the triple taboo of Soviet literature in the writing of some Jewish authors: they wrote about Jews, they were Jews writing about Russia, and they wrote about Russian Orthodoxy (and more broadly about Christianity) while being Jews.10 Can this be applicable to all Jewish nonconformists? Ivanova’s diagnosis may be too 7 Michel Foucault, Fearless Speech (Los Angeles: Semiotext[e], 2001). 8 Alek Rapoport, Nonkonformizm ostaetsia (St. Petersburg: DEAN, 2003), 28–29. 9 Iosif Brodskii, “Evreiskoe kladbishche okolo Leningrada” (“Jewish Cemetery near Leningrad”), Sintaksis 3 (1960), http://rvb.ru/np/publication/05supp/syntaxis/3/ brodsky.htm, accessed October 14, 2016. 10 Natalia Ivanova, “Skvoz´ nenavist´—k liubvi, skvoz´ liubov´—k ponimaniiu,” in Fridrikh Gorenshtein, Psalom (Moscow: Eksmo, 2001).\n\n27\n\n28\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\nessentialist and somewhat inaccurate. It was not so much the artist, the literature, or the writing as the utterance itself that was “Jewish,” in the artistic sense. Commenting on the literary situation of the second half of the 1950s, David Shrayer-Petrov wrote: “We were not divided into Jews and non-Jews,”11 and more often than not there was no place for “Jewish problems”12 in Jewish friendships and conversations. This situation later underwent something of a change, and thoughts about “Jewish writers who shied away from the topic that was most difficult for us: assimilation in Russia or emigration to Israel” acquired a significant meaning.13 And yet these changes had little influence on the poetic tastes and habits of the ones whose creative output was formed in those years. For that reason, the Jewish component of nonconformism should be sought not so much on the social and political plane as on the symbolic plane, in spite of the fact that the social sphere plays a huge role in everything that concerns the relations between the official sphere and unofficial literature, which is framed and defined in in relation to the former. Regardless of how the complex issue of the interrelation between official and unofficial literature is resolved, the latter, as Stanislav Savitsky rightly noted, cannot be reduced to the social, “even when it is understood in the context of action theory.”14 Jews who were nonconformists did not join poetic associations as Jews, and thus the key to understanding their work should be not so much the sociology of communities of writers as the hermeneutics of imagined and symbolic “communities of utterances.” Such an approach does not contradict an understanding of a “unified nonconformist cultural movement,” of “unofficial culture as an integral phenomenon,”15 but it seems more productive in this case. I will now attempt to formulate the theoretical premises on which an analysis of a nonconformist utterance can be built. As a discursive formation, nonconformism (both sociopolitical and poetical) is a sincere, 11 David Shraer-Petrov, Druz´ia i teni. Roman s uchastiem avtora (New York: Liberty, 1989), 112.

It is not enough to not be a conformist in order to be a nonconformist; for literature to be nonconformist it is not enough for it to be unofficial, underground, “second literature.”17 Nonconformism must be understood not as a negative theoretical characteristic but as a positive, active deed, which takes place not in the context of an isolated subculture but in answer to the challenges of the dominant culture and for the sake of solving spiritual and pragmatic problems spawned by this culture. The cultural-pragmatic components of nonconformism are the following: (1) the perception of conflict as a given; (2) the symbolic design of a project as possible/new; (3) the economy of risk/danger as the only real/true/genuine one.18 In this configuration, the structure of myth is easy to infer: (1) the discovery/creation of the conflict; (2) the elimination of the conflict with the aid of a risky/transgressive project (war, a journey, a metamorphosis, a crime, a sacrifice); (3) the realization of one’s personality as transcendental/numinous. Thus, the writing of nonconformism is homologous to mythopoesis. In it, as in myth, the possible and the impossible merge in order to allow the subject to transcend from the conflict into the real (for example, into a consciousness of their own authentic identity). Thanks to the primal conflict, this writing becomes, in Eric Gans’s terms, the generative scene of sign- and culture-creation.19 In this light, the essence of the conflict itself emerges as a consequence of the triangle of the mimetic desire20 to possess symbols, while thanks to the risk connected with this conflict, the nonconformist utterance acquires a performative character and turns into a kind of cultural, ritual, magical formula, irreversibly changing\n\n16 Jürgen Habermas, The Theory of Communicative Action.

In addition, this transformation has a mythical nature, even an epicheroic one: the author symbolically becomes a cultural hero, often a martyr of culture, independently of his or her personal motives and relationships with the official institutions. In the words of Viktor Krivulin, nonconformists thus “lived what they said,” “built their lives according to the word” in a unique “social-cosmic protest,” and “any life circumstance [. . .] was perceived symbolically.”22 And finally, by virtue of the communicative mechanisms that start working (the implementation of unofficial or underground measures), the performative change in the author’s status extends to the public sphere as well. Nonconformist literature is not necessarily a minor one, in Gilles Deleuze’s terminology, but it is always mythopoetic, conceptual, and performative in its essence, outside a dependence on the concrete style and genre of one or another work. In other words, Joseph Brodsky did not at all need to read Paul Tillich in order to see a manifestation of the “courage to be” in poetry.23 Nonconformism is an act that makes the persona of the author a “public sign.”24 Moreover, even falling out of the space of minority and political conflict formation (as in the case of emigration), true nonconformism “remains,” in the words of Alek Rapoport; and nonconformist literature often remains, for example in the case of Ilia Bokstein, a “way of life.”25 Now we can point to what forms the specifically Jewish utterance within the framework of the nonconformist discourse in accordance with its three pragmatic components or dimensions specified here. In the Jewish nonconformist utterance (1) the imagining of conflict has a Jewish character (the incorporation of Jews into the conflict is a necessary but not a sufficient condition); (2) the project of the possible/new is constructed with the aid of 21 See Marcel Moss [Marsel´ Moss], Sotsial´nye funktsii sviashchennogo, tr. I. Utekhin (St. Petersburg: Evraziia, 2000); John L. Austin, How to Do Things with Words (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1975). 22 Viktor Krivulin, “Peterburgskaia spiritual´naia lirika vchera i segodnia (k istorii neofitsial´noi poezii Leningrada 60–80-kh godov,” in Istoriia leningradskoi nepodtsenzurnoi literatury, 103–104. 23 Iakov Gordin, Rytsar´ i smert´, ili Zhizn´ kak zamysel: O sud´be Iosifa Brodskogo (Moscow: Vremia, 2010), 85–101. 24 Boris Ivanov, “Rid Grachev,” in Istoriia leningradskoi nepodtsenzurnoi literatury, 49. 25 Naum Vaiman, “Poeziia kak obraz zhizni: Il´ia Bokshtein,” Open Space, October 12, 2010, http://os.colta.ru/literature/events/details/18665/, accessed October 14, 2016.\n\nThe Nonconformist Poetics of David Shrayer-Petrov\n\nJewish themes, images, and symbols; (3) the revealed and embodied “real” touches upon the Jewish identity or other aspects of the individual. In other words, what is “Jewish” in this discourse is a specifically Jewish (culturally, nationally, or religiously conditioned) recodification of the economy of the risk of “fearless” sign creation in the above-described mythopoesis. Such a formally pragmatic configuration inevitably also influences the ideological content of the utterance. Thanks to the transition from a conflictual arena of meaningcreation, where the “sacred” object of violence, that is, the victim, is a Jew, to the real scene of self-awareness, where the Jew becomes an equal participant in the struggle for the appropriation of the real “sacred,” a new, non-victim or, in Gans’s terms, originary paradigm of Jewish existence is born. The vector of overcoming victimhood appears in Soviet literature at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, in many ways in connection with the Israeli wars and at the same time almost simultaneously with the intensification of the manifestation of the paradigm of SovietJewish victimhood itself (outside the context of the Shoah [Holocaust], acknowledged and assimilated as early as the 1940s–1950s).26 That is to say, Jews are writing more and more about themselves as the victims of the system, but they are also aware of themselves as being capable of not being victims. This dynamic would intensify with time, up to the refusenik literature of the 1970s–1980s, to which the writings of David ShrayerPetrov, which I will be examining below, testify and bear witness. * * * David Shrayer-Petrov (David Peysakhovich [Petrovich] Shrayer) was born in 1936 in Leningrad. In his memoirs, he writes about the circle within which his literary path was initiated. He became acquainted with the would-be film director Ilya Averbakh in 1955 and entered the literary seminar (lito) of the First Leningrad Medical School, in which Vasily Aksyonov also participated. In 1959, David Dar, through Lev Ozerov, showed Shrayer-Petrov’s poems and those of Aleksandr Kushner to Boris Pasternak, who, according to ShrayerPetrov, responded favorably to them, “gave some good advice,” and wanted to meet the young poets personally.27 In the literary seminar (lito) at the Palace of Culture of Industrial Cooperation (later renamed Lensovet Palace 26 Maxim D.

Shrayer-Petrov was professionalized as a literary translator of poetry under the patronage of Efim Etkind and participated in his oral “almanacs,” as well as in the translation seminar of Tatiana Gnedich.30 He admired the poems of the young Joseph Brodsky; a friendship and meetings with him in Leningrad in the early 1960s left an indelible mark on his soul,31 comparable perhaps only with his literary friendship with Genrikh Sapgir, subsequently crowned by his book (together with his son Maxim D. Shrayer) about Sapgir.32 ShrayerPetrov moved to Moscow in 1964. The writer reminisced about the fact that in the winter of 1977–1978 Aksyonov proposed that he participate in the unofficial “grand almanac,” but he refused: barely a year earlier, in early 1976, he “sweated blood” to be accepted into the Writers Union, and “he didn’t want to risk it.”33 In 1979, however, the same year that he and his family applied for emigration to Israel, he supported the position of the Metropol contributors. He was expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers in 1980. During the time he was a refusenik, until late spring of 1987, Shrayer-Petrov wrote a great deal and conducted a literary seminar-salon for refuseniks. During the years of the seminar-salon’s existence such then underground authors as Genrikh Sapgir and Yury Karabchievsky gave readings.34 Shrayer-Petrov also socialized with foreign diplomats; participated in the screenings of films in the British\n\nIbid., 103.

Shrayer-Petrov was subjected to persecution, punitive arrests, and ostracism in the Soviet press. His works appeared in the Jewish samizdat. In 1985, a microfilm of the first part of his refusenik trilogy was illegally taken out of the USSR to Israel and formed the bulk a collection of materials about refuseniks published by Biblioteka-Aliia in 1986.39 The first two parts of the future refusenik trilogy would be first published in Moscow in 1992 under the title Gerbert i Nelli (Herbert and Nelly) and subsequently reprinted twice in Russia. The refusenik novel, and specifically its first publication in Israel, gave a powerful boost to the development of the Jewish theme in ShrayerPetrov’s work, a development that had started much earlier. The writer’s son, the literary scholar and author Maxim D. Shrayer, writes, “Starting with his earliest poems, which became known in samizdat since the 1950s and 1960s, Shrayer-Petrov examined the nature of the Jewish consciousness, antisemitism, and the relations between Jews and Russians under the Soviet totalitarian regime.”40 Shrayer-Petrov’s Jewish identity formed under the influence of his family. His “Jewish genes,” according to him, prevented him from living “normally” all his life.41 In his grandmother’s house, he read the “Jewish Bible with a parallel Russian translation” voraciously,42 while the image of his Uncle Moisey (Moshe Sharir), who had left home in 1924 for the British Mandate of Palestine to build a Jewish state,43 brought to this identity a warm attachment to Israel 35 Shraer-Petrov, Okhota na ryzhego d’iavola.

If it weren’t for the constant anguish characteristic of my generation’s young intelligentsia! The anguish was probably connected with thoughts of our possible emigration. However I might convince myself that everything was going well for my “albeit little family,” the literary events of the past decade could never ever vanish from memory: the public rout of Vladimir Dudintsev’s Not by Bread Alone (1956), the civil execution of Boris Pasternak for publishing Doctor Zhivago abroad (1958), the trial and [punitive] exile of Joseph Brodsky (1964), and much else. The catalyst for these secret subversive thoughts was the meeting with Tsilya Poliak, my wife Mila’s aunt, who had come to Moscow from Israel [in the midle 1960s] to visit her family.46\n\nThus finally, in 1979, the Shrayer family started to live the life of activist refuseniks: “We met constantly with other refuseniks and dissidents (Vladimir Slepak, Josef Begun, Yuri Medvedkov, Aleksander Lerner, and others), we extended the hospitality of our home to representatives of Jewish organizations from the United States, Canada, England, and France, who fought actively for our liberation from this ‘new Egyptian captivity.’”47 It is therefore no surprise that the vast majority of Shrayer-Petrov’s prose and poetry was not published in the Soviet Union. In his memoirs, he writes that his first book of poetry was withdrawn from publication in Leningrad “for his friendship with Joseph Brodsky”; in 1979–1980, for the attempt to emigrate, his collection of poetry Winter Ship (Zimnii korabl´), his book of translations from Lithuanian, and his book of prose Hunt for the Red Devil (Okhota na ryzhego d´iavola) were steamrolled, the latter already in galleys.48 (See also Maxim D. Shrayer’s and Ian Probstein’s essays in this volume.)

As previously mentioned, from 1979, when he applied for and refused permission to emigrate, up to his emigration in early June 1987, Shrayer-Petrov wrote a great deal, and some of his prose works of this period are vivid examples of refusenik literature. To this period belong, first of all, the refusenik trilogy, the first part of which was written in 1979–1980,50 and the second part in 1982–1984;51 and the “novel-fantella” Yudin’s Redemption (Iskuplenie Iudina), which ShrayerPetrov started while a refusenik (1981–1982) and subsequently revised for the original publication in the United States (1992–1993).52 (About Yudin’s Redemption, see Leonid Katsis’s essay in this volume.) The booklength cycle Nevan Poems (Nevskie stikhi), poems on Jewish themes, short stories, the play in verse Ed Tenner (titled Vaktsina [Vaccine] in the revised edition), and Friends and Shadows (Druz´ia i teni), a book of memoirs about Leningrad and Leningrad writers of the 1950s and early 1960s, were also written during these years. I shall dwell here in greater detail primarily on the texts of the refusenik period, in the hope that Shrayer-Petrov’s work will be examined in all its breadth and fullness in subsequent studies. Refusenik literature recodes the conflict with the authorities from the political to the cultural and spiritual spheres. Applying to OVIR (Section of Visas and Registrations) for emigration to Israel was already in and of itself an act-utterance of “fearless speech” that irrevocably changed the social status of the applicant, initiated his new identity, and transcended him beyond the bounds of Soviet reality, and reality in general, to that primal scene of generative conflict where new signification was born and the battle for meaning was waged. Not so much the desire to leave, accompanied by the government’s refusal to grant permission and refusal of freedom, as the refusal of the individual to come to terms with the refusal, the protest constitutes a nonconformist element in this act-utterance.53 It was a protest against Jewish humility and helplessness, dependence, and secondariness, the symbolic embodiment of which the heroes of Shrayer-Petrov's refusenik trilogy see in Eastern European grasses “stretching out under the peasant’s scythe,” or in the tree mushrooms (conks) “on a Russian trunk”: the trunk 49 Shraer-Petrov, Okhota na ryzhego d´iavola, 175. 50 Shraer-Petrov, V otkaze, 242. 51 Shraer-Petrov, Gerbert i Nelli (Moscow: Poliform, 1992), 588. 52 Shraer-Petrov, Iskuplenie Iudina, Mosty 5 (2005): 5–61; 6 (2005): 21–116; 7 (2005): 11–88. 53 Shraer-Petrov, Gerbert i Nelli, 154.\n\n35\n\n36\n\nDavid Shrayer-Petrov: Life, Art, and Thought\n\n“nourished us and allowed us to develop.”54 Even more so, the foundation of nonconformism here is not only a protest against the decision of the Soviet authorities but also a protest against the rules of the game, the “laws of the genre” according to which this drama was being played out. In ShrayerPetrov’s short novel Strange Danya Rayev (Stannyi Dania Raev), the events of which unfold during the evacuation to the Urals during World War II, a Jewish woman bravely stands up to an anti-Semite in front of everyone at the marketplace. Her young son shouts “words of justice, fidelity, and protest” into the face of another offender, who happens to be a Jew and who is attempting to take the place of the boy’s father, an officer at the war front, and humiliating both the mother and the boy, calling the military uniform, which the father had sent his son from the front, a “masquerade.”55 And yet it was not the protesting subjects but the Soviet authorities that were performing a sinister carnival. The refuseniks were turning the Soviet carnival on its head, straightening what was twisted, and staging a true drama. The carnival was depriving everything that was individual of meaning, was appropriating and ravaging the present moment by filling it with phantoms and nightmares, was wiping out all that was culturally significant, unique, and meaningful. The activity of refuseniks was aimed at the diametrically opposite side—on the restoration of the mechanisms of culture creation and the establishment of a true being of the individual in the “now” of history, with its, in Bakhtin’s terms, consciousness of a task and responsibility of the writing-action.56 In this connection, the particular attachment of refuseniks to a celebration of Purim and the Purim spiel (Purim play) is telling. In spite of its external, subsequently acquired masquerade appearance, this traditionally subversive holiday of the victory over tyranny is not carnivalesque in essence: its content has no relation to the Bakhtinian “popular culture of laughter,” and at its foundation lies not in the act of forgetting oneself but, on the contrary, a nation’s recollection of its own roots. David Shrayer-Petrov’s refusenik texts convincingly demonstrate this common and shared direction. His creation of a Purim spiel script57 and his 54 Ibid., 381–382. 55 David Shraer-Petrov, Eti strannye russkie evrei. Romany: Savelii Ronkin.

Later, when he was already living in the United States and reflecting on the past, the writer pointed to the fact that one can consider the image-event of the death of Stalin to be the meaning-creating event of his life, the foundational myth, “when, as in a fairytale, the Evil Sorcerer dies and Justice triumphs.”58 In the eyes of Shrayer-Petrov, Stalin died during Purim, before he could realize his worst plans regarding the Jews (the “doctors’ plot” and mass deportation), and the victory of Justice acquired a personal, national, mythological meaning.59 It is for this reason that the Purim spiel for Shrayer-Petrov is a celebration of the initiation and realization of the individual in history. Stalin’s death became the symbol of the resolution of a conflict, the deferral of violence, even if only temporarily, and the birth of a new life and a new kind of consciousness. For Shrayer-Petrov, as for many of his contemporaries, re-Stalinization,60 the resurrection of Stalin, was the worst nightmare, the symbol of violence, the loss of their individuality and humanity.61 The symbol as self-awareness through another is the central component of the structure of nonconformism; the symbol conjoins two other aspects: imagining the conflict, and the “real” of true identity. As Shrayer-Petrov’s works testify, this central compo"
