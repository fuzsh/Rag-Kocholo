Moreover, they opened up horizons, bringing about a qualitatively different idea of a “space age,” no longer as imminently tied to as much physical human presence in space as nineteenth- and early twentiethcentury visionaries, pioneers of space philosophy, art, and technologies had anticipated. The flying worlds of popular science fiction series from the 1960s–1980s, such as The Jetsons (1962–1963), Taina tretiei planety (The Mystery of the Third Planet) (1981), and Raumpatrouille—Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion (Space Patrol—The Fantastic Adventures of the Orion Spaceship) (1966) appear as foreign today as they did fifty years ago.2 However, they are foreign in a different sense than they probably were at the time of their production. It is neither surprising nor difficult to explain the Amero-Soviet fascination with the prospects of a “future in space” during the space race, fueled by the Cold War, and manifest abundantly in the dominant popular cultural formats of the twentieth century, film and television series, and of course literature. Such popular-cultural references point to a particular aspect of the bygone space age, that is to its cultural and sociopolitical dimensions, allowing us to decode what kinds of philosophical, popular-scientific, aesthetic, technological, as well as political and national imaginaries that xv\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nspace age belonged to. At the same time, all these imaginaries have since evolved, and have been integrated into our collective memory—the assemblage of means, or pathways, into the past (e.g., media, technologies, and narratives), as well as the contents that these relate to (e.g., words, ideas, plots, and physical objects, either coming directly from the past or commemorating it).3 Coordinately, the dawn of the space age today relates to specific, canonized popular cultural works (e.g., Isaac Asimov and Stanisław Łem’s short stories and novels, films like The Day the Earth Stood Still [1951] and Solyaris (Solaris) [1972]), but also to the International Day of Cosmonautics, coincident with the date of Yuri Gagarin’s first spaceflight of April 12, 1961, and the anniversaries of Neil Armstrong’s moon landing, which took place on July 21, 1969.4 Historical anniversaries are both affirmations and tests. Their scope, semantic, and emotive emphases, as well as the memorabilia, such as souvenirs, but also posters, brands, films, series, songs, and books produced to honor historical events at their anniversaries allow us to trace various transformations in the collective memories of these events. If Maurice Halbwachs, whose work is usually associated with the concepts of social frameworks, so-called filters that allow societies to interpret and to remember—that is, to reproduce at later dates and within various contexts—developed the metaphorical concept of “collective memory,” Aleida and Jan Assmann refined this term to analytically distinguish between “communicative memory” and “cultural memory.”5 If the former designates memories, operative within the realm of oral history, and relate to relatively recent events, which can still be narrated by those people that they had had a direct impact on, the latter refers to the material memories of older events. However, the distinction is not always clear-cut. Or, more precisely, the two categories often lead to divergent analyses; what is socially communicated about an event does not necessarily coincide with this event’s material ramifications. The associations that one has about, say, the launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite, by looking at its replica (e.g., reflections on its size, symbolic shape or Soviet provenance), need not coincide with the interpretations of the significance of the launch, provided by philosophers (just think of Marshall McLuhan’s famous theories of the world as a global village), or those of the involved witnesses, the satellite’s developers, journalists, or, last but not least, the disengaged, passive witnesses. Moreover, over the past five decades, all these diverse testimonies will have transformed, integrating one another and subscribing to various ideological frameworks. To put it simply, communicative and cultural memory depend greatly on the policies and contingencies that allow certain texts to rise above the archives, and bury other texts; in this sense, returns to the archives are particularly welcome in times of debates over meanings and narratives. The discussion\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\non the sociocultural and conceptual significance of the space age today is marked by several of these. Apart from the confusion that can arise due to the presence of different stakeholders and the shifting temporal frame (because, which one specific event should one count as the beginning of the space age, and which—as its end?), collective memories of events, such as the dawn of the space age, are, in the twenty-first century, significantly skewed owing to another factor. The anniversaries of space-age-related events remind us, quite loudly, that the history of the space age of the twentieth century is still primarily the history of state-funded space programs, which, to an important degree, reflected the political interests of the parties taking part in the Cold War; the space age of the twentieth century is much too often depicted as the “race for space” between the USSR and the United States. This is evident from the nature of commemorations (the anniversary of the moon landing is therefore much more resonant in the United States than it is in Russia, and the opposite is true of the Sputnik 1 and of pioneering spaceflights), as well as from the body of scholarly literature generated on the history of spaceflight, and on the various interpretations of its cultural, philosophical, and soci(et)al significance over the past five decades.6 Despite the recent surge in attempts to tease out the vibrant domains of space history, sociology, and (popular) cultural studies from the methodologically nationalist trajectories that they usually subscribe to, there remains a lot of work to be done, and important epistemological questions to be tackled along the way.7 It would be futile—not to mention unnecessary and conceited—to attempt to abandon all references to national frameworks that had harbored and enabled so many of the achievements of space-related research of the previous century. At the same time, it may—and this is the position that will be advanced in the present book—be beneficial to make an effort to consider the national(ist) aspect of space programs in a non-essentializing manner; I argue that the methodological tools of memory studies and cultural studies are of particular value here. Namely, while it is true that “American,” “Soviet,” and other space programs developed in distinct, and only semi-permeable political, technological, and cultural frameworks, the resonance of the dawn of the space age has both transnational and global effects, many of which are of philosophical, conceptual, and sociocultural nature. In order to access these, I propose to turn to cultural production, namely, to cinema, and to investigate films in terms of their mnemonic agency, that is, their capacity to transmit, narrate, interpret, and thereby—both tacitly and explicitly—to address topics, forms, and questions that represent parts of the collective memory of the space age in the Russian context today. It may of course seem offbeat to argue against methodological nationalism and, at the same time, to propose a book on films tied to a very particular national (Soviet/Russian) and cultural\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\ncontext; at the same time, it is this very contextualization that allows one to free certain concepts and ideas, addressed by the proposed selection of films, from stereotypes about their (Soviet/Russian) provenance, and to access them in a more nuanced way. The aim of this book is to point to the dynamics of the concepts at play in Soviet/Russian (space) science fiction (also “sf” and “space sf” in the context of this book); to highlight the inner dilemmas and heterogeneity of the genre; and to reconstruct the aesthetics and narratives of the cultural myth of Soviet space supremacy from the perspective of film, arguably the most important audiovisual medium of the twentieth century. SETTING THE SCENE: THE “NON-PLACE” FANTASY One of the aspirations of the book is to give voice to those aspects of space exploration that often remain obscured in space-related film reviews and in histories of space programs. Accordingly, Stevphen Shukaitis has argued that contemporary approaches to space programs rely on a representational conceptualization of outer space, employing it as an answer to terrestrial political and economic crises and circumstances.8 Shukaitis discussed this apprehension of space as a “(non)place.” Space as a non-place functions both in Michel de Certeau’s terms, that is, as a place constructed on rules established by ideological apparatuses such as legal institutions, schools and political actors, and as discussed by Marc Augé, as a space of transition regulated by texts and signs, like an airport or a shopping mall.9 This means that we quickly anticipate what a certain space-oriented text of film is about, and how the protagonists of this text are going to act. In Cold War Hollywood films, the aliens will probably be antagonistic and will remind the spectators of the threat of Eastern-European communism; in post-Soviet Russian films, the cosmonauts will survive even the most hopeless situation, and emerge as heroes, as long as they believe in the Soviet cause, and so on. In contrast with these formulations, Shukaitis stressed that outer space could be conceptualized as a Deleuzian “imaginal machine,” that is, a milieu that fosters the emergence of new sets of rules, ideas, and worlds. According to Shukaitis, outer space could be such a Deleuzian space of radical imagination, that is, it could be a space for novel concepts, ideas, and social structures, but in fact currently is not one. Rather, it is akin to a floating signifier, which is systematically filled with humanity’s projections that reflect the current sociopolitical circumstances, such as romantic utopianism, which favors the search for new worlds, or the Cold War, which induces paranoia about the possible omnipresence of the ideological enemy. In the domain of cinema, outer space fulfills another function. Aside from being a grateful arena for playing out terrestrial conflicts, it serves as the arena for the ultimate\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nspectacle. This has been pointed out by Susan Sontag in her classic 1965 discussion of American science fiction cinema: Science fiction films are one of the purest forms of spectacle. [ . . . ] Things, objects, machinery play a major role in these films. A greater range of ethical values is embodied in the décor of these films than in the people. Things, rather than the helpless humans, are the locus of values because we experience them, rather than people, as the sources of power. According to science fiction films, man is naked without his artifacts. They [sic] stand for different values, they are potent, they are what gets destroyed, and they are the indispensable tools for the repulse of the alien invaders or the repair of the damaged environment.10\n\nSontag’s argument foregrounded an important point; despite the typically heavy reliance on narratives, which are often adaptations of science fiction literature, the cinematic medium does much more than merely “adapt” narrative-based scripts. As audio-visual productions, science fiction films provide a certain “immediacy” of experience, which arguably cannot be reproduced in the experience of reading. Cinema does not represent experience; rather, it constructs it. Hence, in science fiction films, particularly in the more introspective productions, artifacts such as machines, monuments, or buildings sometimes function as elongations of thought. A monumental building, such as the Empire State Building in The Day the Earth Stood Still, may hence center the world around itself, turning it into a specific place, which points to the center and to the periphery of the world, to the good and the evil actors, to which decisions are acceptable and which are not. Humans are no longer the only carriers of subjectivity or the only possible loci of the viewer’s identification. Anthropomorphic subjectivity is only one of many possible variants, alongside others, such as inorganic cultural artifacts. The texture of the cinematic world itself, engaging factors such as the mise-en-scène, the script, the characters and extra-cinematic references, pertaining to contemporary and historical issues, both allows for experimentation and presents limitations for presenting radical otherness. At the same time, the capacity of film to visualize radical otherness has often, and usually unfavorably, been compared to literary production. Certainly, the argument on the imaginal capacities of space-themed science fiction cinema is limited by the realities of film production. The American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) played an active role in the Hollywood film industry, in accordance with the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act that obliged the Administration to keep the public as informed as possible about its activities. In the 1960s, the agency formed a special Entertainment Industry Liaison in charge of collaboration with the\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\npopular culture industry. Until the 1990s, when direct participation between NASA and film production began, the former was predominantly concerned with the film industry’s accuracy in its portrayal of the development of space technologies and depiction of key milestones of scientific progress.11 Collaboration with the entertainment industry also helped NASA maintain its positive public image even in the light of space tragedies such as the Challenger catastrophe in 1986.12 While Western European space programs did not focus on systematic collaboration with the film industry, an indirect relation between the two can be noted in the USSR. The movie industry was subordinated to the State Committee of Cinematography (Goskino), which authorized production of all films.13 Goskino generally endorsed space travel films with apparently unambiguous narratives and treated science fiction as a potentially educational genre, supporting ideologically plausible productions that celebrated the Soviet space program and its future, and were often aimed at younger audiences, increasingly so in the 1970s.14 A large proportion of space-themed science fiction cinema was also subordinated to representational functions, namely to visualizing the future while representing the ambitions and achievements of space programs and thereby to conveying subliminal ideology-infused messages, such as value hierarchies, national stereotypes or visions of the future. As such, twentieth-century science fiction cinema typically constructed outer space in terms of an inside/ outside binary. In doing so, it used a variety of space-related tropes (space exploration and/or invasion from outer space) in order to construct this binary along ideological, geopolitical, gender, psychological, and biopolitical axes, which will be discussed in chapter 1. SPACE AGE UTOPIAS IN THE SOVIET CONTEXT Equally important as the sociopolitical context of the twentieth century, which prominently framed particular sociocultural imaginations, representations and, ultimately, interpretations of the space age is the tradition of specific literary and cinematic genres that most of the films discussed in this book either directly belonged to or drew inspiration from. Just like space is most often not conceived of as an imaginal machine, but rather as a non-place that invites the projection of certain earthly value binaries, expectations, and codes of conduct, space science fiction popular culture, including films, has, by now, become a pool of references on their own. In opposition to science fiction literature, lauded as the prime medium for imagining and thinking radical difference and radical otherness, science fiction films are—with few exceptions, such as Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)—often challenged as bleak and disappointing illustrations of\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nthe literary genre in general or of a specific literary work adapted to fit the cinematic screen. This is particularly true of many of the Soviet and Russian productions discussed in this book, the vast majority of which were based on novels, novellas, or other forms of prose by local authors. Many of the films discussed were, as we shall soon see, first received by spectators with disappointment for this particular reason, interpreted as inefficient and simplified visualizations of great ideas; and yet, as the cultural value of these films shifted from hopeful representations of the future to nostalgic symbols of a past vision, their critiques changed, too. For this reason, Soviet Science Fiction Cinema and the Space Age discusses Soviet screen representations of the space age and their legacy from the vantage point of memory studies, slowly untangling the processes of maturation that have marked particular past utopias, and following the story of the formation of a corpus of “cult” films for today’s science fiction and Soviet history fans. Focusing on space-related science fiction, the book hopes to enrich the fields of science fiction studies and utopia studies. Darko Suvin famously and influentially described utopia as the “sociopolitical subgenre of science fiction” and thus ultimately the site of social and societal critique, as well as representations of a better social order.15 Drawing inspiration from Ernst Bloch, Suvin productively aligned the political potential of science fiction with utopian desire for a better, and a more just society. Emphasizing sf’s interest in a certain technological or scientific novum, Suvin theorized the political at the heart of sf with the mechanism of cognitive estrangement—the capacity of sf literature to both make the reader look at their own society from the outside, while embracing the mechanisms of cognition as a secure link between the fictional and the possible. This early Suvinian position has commonly been described as primarily political (rather than strictly academic), and reliant on his particular interpretation of Marxism. Indeed, in a 1997 essay discussing the links between science fiction, utopia, and communism, Suvin wrote: We need radically liberating novums only. By “radically liberating” I mean not only a new quality as opposed to simple marketing difference: I mean a novelty that is in critical opposition to degrading relationships between people as well as to the commodification of human and surrounding nature, and in fertile relation to memories of a humanized past.16\n\nHence the polemical alignment of utopia and science fiction as potentially— due to its reliance on cognition, which prevents slips into irreal flights of fancy—the most productively utopian of literary genres. This position has been embraced and further developed by Fredric Jameson, whose seminal work Archaeologies of the Future (2005) provided further possible analytical distinctions, useful for the analysis of utopian texts, separating, for instance,\n\nxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe utopian wish from the utopian form.17 While these distinctions will be activated in relevant chapters of this book, they will also be grappled with from the productively critical insights, recently generated by scholars, such as China Miéville, Mark Bould, Carl Freedman, and Stephen Zepke, who questioned Suvin and Jameson’s strict preference for sf over other modes of imagining the future.18 With the help of the films presented in this book, I hope to map the narrative, visual and medium, that is film-specific persistence of certain utopian ideals as they traveled through sf subgenres (from science fiction proper to its more speculative and fantasy-infused variants, to melodramas that employed sf elements, to modern fictionalizations of the history of the space age), times and media, assessing the history of Soviet and Russian space utopianism in terms of impulse, program, and the temporalities that it has engaged with. REMEMBERING THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY SOVIET DREAM THROUGH FILM A brief look at contemporary popular culture shows a plethora of apparently nostalgic reinterpretations of the formative events of the space age, blockbuster feature films, such as Hollywood’s First Man (2018) and Hidden Figures (2016), as well as the Russian productions Salyut 7 (Salyut 7) (2017) and Vremia pervykh (The Age of Pioneers) (2017) being the most recent cases in point.19 These films have reinforced the synchronic link between the popularity of film as a medium, cinema as an experience, and space age as the imminent future (of the twentieth century). At the same time, formal analyses of these films reveal important intertextual references; not only did the films utilize tropes from various genres, from science fiction to the thriller, to the epic, they also relied on multitudes of documentary and fictional sources. To echo Jacques Rancière, the space age of the previous century, so science-fictional when it actually happened, is being fictionalized “in order to be thought.”20 In the process, it is being collectively remembered, and so is the history of science fiction that had, in the twentieth century, imagined, thought, recounted, and extrapolated the possible consequences of the space age. Numerous scholars have noted the particular significance of recent, twentyfirst century returns to the history of the space age in the Russian context.21 Slava Gerovitch’s seminal work explicitly positioned these returns in the context of mythologies, derived from communicative and cultural memory, and, following Natalia Ivanova theorized them as no(w)stalgia.22 According to Gerovitch, contemporary reappropriations of the Soviet mythology of space supremacy, such as film adaptations, books, and even thematic techno\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxiii\n\nparties with explicit references to first cosmonaut Gagarin, chief constructor Sergei Korolev and others, are qualitatively different than proverbially bittersweet nostalgic longing of a lost past (and, in our case, its future). Rather than lamenting a lost future, these contemporary products and practices should be viewed as attempts to negotiate the symbols of a past, Soviet era in a new context, to reinscribe them with new meanings, only partly resembling the original ones. Gerovitch’s 2015 study is particularly timely, as it narrated a very recent phenomenon, and expands on legitimate earlier observations, which reflect on post-Soviet reappropriations of the Soviet space age in terms of the more conventional understanding of nostalgia. Among these, Daria Kabanova, for instance, argued that “in the post-Soviet context, signifiers of the Socialist state provide a link to the mythologies of the national past, serving as constant reminders of what was lost,” including past visions of the future.23 Utopian and dystopian futures, technological progress, the evolution of our idea of life and intelligence, and of human morality were common topics in Soviet science fiction. Due to strict censorship until the perestroika in the 1980s, Soviet science fiction was particularly versed in employing diverse strategies of varying levels of subtlety to convey politically non-sanctioned messages. While some of these strategies (allegory, subtle references, “internal jokes”) may be deciphered through narrative and thematic interpretative analysis, others relate specifically to form, or can be accessed at the intersection of form, content, and context.24 At the same time, the gradual evolution of aesthetic preferences and strategies intervenes into both cultural and communicative memories, as certain forms, as well as genres and ideas are praised and highlighted at the expense of others (e.g., Andrei Tarkovsky’s legacy was echoed in many later Soviet science fiction films, as was the aesthetics of Soviet children’s science fiction). While Soviet literary science fiction has attracted the attention of a notable number of scholars, and has been assessed from numerous perspectives, including its various takes on space exploration, Soviet science fiction cinema, well-documented in the Russian state film archive (Gosfilmofond) and available on online platforms, such as the Filmotheque of the Russian space agency’s television studio (Tvroscosmos) and YouTube, remains underresearched and is mostly subject to interpretative analyses, or analyses of its technical aspects.25 Among the former, Andrei Rogatchevski’s insightful study focused specifically on space exploration within Soviet science fiction cinema, involving a comparative perspective—references to then contemporary American science fiction cinema. The research focused primarily on cinematic narrative and sociopolitical and cultural references, similarly to an influential article by Fredric Jameson, whose brief comment on the coldness of Soviet science fiction cinema attributed it to the ideological context of rationalist Soviet socialism and the canon of socialist realism.26 Soviet\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nscience fiction cinema is often examined as a utopian mirror or productively dystopian critique of its sociopolitical and ideological context, and only in very specific cases (e.g., A. Tarkovsky’s oeuvre, Kin-Dza-Dza!), in terms of its aesthetics and possible globally resonant philosophical ideas. The cinematic-policy-analysis-supported conviction that censorship-filtered mainstream Soviet science fiction cinema was more ideologically subordinated and aesthetically less potent than science fiction literature, which could avoid official publication channels and emerge underground, partly justifies the aforementioned research shortcoming. At the same time, this very circumstance also makes mainstream Soviet science fiction cinema worthy of scholarly attention: dubbed as “the most important art” by Vladimir I. Lenin, Soviet cinema was positioned at the nexus of aesthetics and ideological guidelines followed by Goskino. As the latter grew softer after the end of socialist realism as the canon of cultural production in 1956, Soviet cinema developed toward two poles: mainstream, commercial production, and auteur cinema. Both poles are represented in science fiction film production, but the works of auteurs (Tarkovsky, Georgy Daneliya) have thus far received a far greater amount of scholarly attention than films, which did not receive equal critical acclaim. Nevertheless, both auteur and mainstream films contributed equally to creating an imagery of Soviet space age future(s), and thus provide diverse aesthetic memories of the space age. While these films are documented and accessible, they have not yet been analyzed as part of a corpus, addressing a common topic. Furthermore, they are rarely analyzed in terms of cinematic poetics, rather than as more or less precise adaptations of literary works/scripts. Yet, not only precision is at stake. Stephen Hutchings’s research on Soviet and Russian screen adaptations of literature has convincingly demonstrated that “dialogue between cinema and literature forms part of a larger image–word dialectic which is always ideological in nature, and in which image generally fulfils the role of ‘naturalizing,’ and so authenticating, the ideological thrust of the literary word.”27 Moreover, collection, distribution, and promotion of this corpus of films by TvRoscosmos, Soviet popular culture online databases created by fans, as well as mentions of Soviet science fiction in studies of Soviet popular culture are turning Soviet science fiction cinema into a visible part of cultural memory. A meaningful redistribution is therefore slowly taking place, enabled by the resources of the World Wide Web; certain cultural texts (in the broad understanding of the term, that is, all formats of recorded, encoded information) are getting transferred from the realm of “stored” memory, the ones hidden in the archives, into the domain of “functional” memory—contemporary points of reference.28 The Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) has provided an invaluable contribution in this regard; it not only administrates a wide range of\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxv\n\npopular-scientific media, aimed at popularizing the “Russian cosmos” or, in other words, the legacy of the Soviet space program. Roscosmos also manages a website, which, among other materials, features a rich film archive. An important section of this archive is entitled “Feature films on outer space and cosmonauts”; the section is divided into two subpages, one featuring “Soviet” (thirty-eight films), and the second “Russian” productions (twenty-one films, one still under production at the time this book was written). The archive not only provides basic information on the films, stating the date of release, director, and production company, but also, where possible, features links to full-length versions of the films, albeit mostly without English subtitles. While the archive clearly does not live up to all of the “commonist” promises of digital archives, such as participatory compilation, remixing, commenting, and other means that would allow the public to interact with it, alter it, and develop it, it does notably increase the visibility of Soviet and Russian space-related popular culture, allowing for easier synchronic and diachronic analysis of selected films, and therefore favoring the transition of this corpus into the realm of functional memory. THE SCOPE OF THE BOOK This book examines the archive described earlier as a repository of Soviet popular culture on outer space, that is, as an institution participating in a spontaneous politics of memory by allowing certain films trespass from the realm of stored memory into functional memory; hopefully, the present book contributes to this process. The book examines the archive, with a particular focus on science fiction, contextualizing and foregrounding twenty-three Soviet science fiction films and ten post-Soviet Russian films “on outer space,” occasionally complementing close, concept-oriented film readings that combine narrative and visual analysis with references to existent reviews and other historical material, in order to incorporate three interconnected perspectives: Time and Temporalities in the Context of Utopia and Axiological Ambiguity According to official records, such as the TvRoscosmos archive and the records of Gosfilmofond, space-related science fiction films accounted for over half of all USSR science fiction cinema in 1924–1991. The corpus of films involves approximately ten utopian productions (including 1950s–1960s science fiction, which, to a large degree, still adhered to the artistic and axiological canon of socialist realism, and late, commercial entertainment\n\nxxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nproductions (e.g., Podzemelie ved’m [Witches’ Catacombs] [1989]), seven dystopian works (particularly from the late 1970s and from the perestroika period of the late 1980s), and axiologically ambiguous films (e.g., Doznanie pilota Pirksa [The Inquest of Pilot Pirx] [1979], as well as—interestingly enough—children’s and teen films).29 In this book, I offer close readings of selected films in order to provide a more complex take on the notions of utopia and dystopia in the context of Soviet (and post-Soviet) space-cinema, accounting for the immediate referential context and the formal techniques used in these films. A specific analytical emphasis is placed on the relation between the past and the future: while some films are set in the “present,” others explore the “future,” and make implicit and explicit references to the “present,” providing important temporal contexts for their utopian and dystopian aspects. The book traces how selected films navigated between the immediate, socialist ideological context, the legacy of modernity’s praise of scientific progress, and visions of humanity’s future in the space age. Soviet Science Fiction Cinema and the Space Age thus assesses the evolution of the topic of space-exploration and space travel in Soviet cinema in terms of both politics of aesthetics and aesthetics of politics. Us, Them, and the In-Betweens: Dominant Tropes (Non)-Identity Space exploration was a strong thematic preoccupation of Soviet science fiction cinema, but it is arguably the limits of space exploration or, so to say, the coordinates of space as a non-place, that have been of particular interest to researchers. Topics, such as futuristic technological development, extraterrestrial encounters, military rivalry in space, and human enhancement, typical of Hollywood science fiction cinema, were not nearly as prominent in Soviet cinema. Here, the dominant trope for describing future society until the perestroika was a multicultural, egalitarian society, which had overcome national and political barriers, and integrated cultural differences into its structure. This society is close to genderless, following the Soviet proposition that the revolution had solved “the women’s question” by politically affirming and structurally endorsing equal rights and responsibility for all sexes. At the same time, intimate interpersonal unions as depicted in these science fiction films are heterosexual and procreative; emotional and intimate closeness correlates strongly with the compatibility of the intellectual capacities of the persons involved, or, when this is not the case, is deemed destructive and alien. Therefore, if aliens featured rarely in pre-perestroika science fiction (e.g., Tumannost’ Andromedy [Andromeda Nebula] [1967]; Tainstvennaia stena [The Mysterious Wall] [1967]), it is because their place was taken up by everything that is not rational in the human being.30 Perestroika science\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxvii\n\nfiction cinema also relied heavily on this dichotomy of the rational and irrational, but the boundaries between humans, robots, and aliens became somewhat more obscure, as science fiction cinema gets the opportunity to explore both its commercial, entertainment pole (e.g., Podzemelie ved’m), and its overtly politically critical dimension (Es ist nicht leicht ein Gott zu sein [Hard to Be a God] [1989]).31 The second aim of this book is, then, to investigate the estrangement devices, which Soviet science fiction cinema used to portray the human subject and its other(s). Soviet space science fiction cinema outlines three main others: the gendered other (the woman), the alien other (often, an alien woman), the technological—robotic other (technology is often portrayed as cold, remote, and foreign in Soviet science fiction). Moreover, I argue that Soviet science fiction cinema developed childhood as a trope of liminality, borderline existence, identified with the ultimate horizon of the future, yet at the same time necessarily absent from the present. Film as Memory: Soviet Science Fiction Film and the Memory of the Space Age In the context of memory studies, feature cinema “exists in a relationship to contemporary discourses of memory and illustrates functions, processes, and problems of memory in the medium of fiction through aesthetic forms.”32 This book makes a further argument, positing that cinema not only exists in a relationship to contemporary discourses of memory and illustrates memoryrelated phenomena, or is a result of certain memory politics, exposing dominant and marginal memory narratives. Rather, Soviet Science Fiction Cinema and the Space Age argues that films about the future actively engage in memory politics on several levels. Certainly, Soviet cosmos-themed science fiction cinema was embedded into waves of different (e.g., Stalinist, Thaw, stagnation, perestroika) state memory politics; it was therefore intended to create and reproduce different memories of the envisaged space age future; memories targeting different audiences (e.g., children’s science fiction for younger generations, melodramas aimed at women, philosophical dramas for intellectuals, space-detective films for technological sf enthusiasts and fans of Hollywood cinema). It also created and (re)produced popular, widely known images of the Soviet space future (some films were distributed abroad; some were adapted for the Western market (e.g., Planeta bur’/ The Planet of Storms [1962]).33 Today, these films are treated as belonging to a single corpus of Soviet cosmos-themed popular culture, but only some of them are widely known, appreciated, or examined as part of the memories related to the myth of Soviet supremacy in the space race. Soviet Science Fiction Cinema and the Space Age traces how these films conveyed and transferred memories of the space age, with their own formal aesthetics, use of intertextual references\n\nxxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\n(or surprising lack of intertextual references between different films from the corpus), and comparing the image of the space age they portrayed in terms of formal aesthetics against reviews, which show how they were received by different audiences (critics and lay audiences), and examining the circumstances for their value today—as no(w)stalgic statements, cult items, archival rarities or persistent, if not always explicitly acknowledged, axiological flagships. THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK The chapters of Soviet Science Fiction Cinema and the Space Age are structured around two trajectories: a somewhat loose historical one and a thematic one, focusing on prominent themes and tropes, such as conflicts, utopias, space exploration, as well as concepts, such as liminality, othering, and remembrance. The first chapter positions the history of Soviet science fiction cinema in the context of the history of twentieth-century Western cinematic astroculture. Seeing Soviet sf productions, such as Aelita (Aelita) (1924) and Nebo zovet (The Sky Calls) (1959) addressed alongside a broad range of Western films, from Georges Méliès’s Voyage dans la Lune (Voyage to the Moon) (1902) to The Day the Earth Stood Still and Es ist nicht leicht ein Gott zu sein (1989), allows the reader to gain an understanding of the development of this genre in the context of international and global cultural and political preoccupations.34 Starting from the common assumption that twentieth century science fiction is a rather violent genre, and that its encounters with outer space are, to a great extent, a side product of the Space Race and the Cold War, this chapter emphasizes the diversity at the heart of space-clashes and conflicts in sf cinema. Using films from both sides of the “iron curtain” as examples and interlocuters, I outline the ideological, geopolitical, psychological, and biopolitical focal trajectories of humanity’s encounters with outer space. The analysis focuses on the military and violent aspects of space sf films, including tropes of alien invasions, future apocalyptic disasters, and social disintegration. The constructions of outer space as a battleground sometimes coincided with the political realities of the time but sometimes also subverted or bypassed them. Referring to film directors’ uses of metaphorical and formalist devices, I stress the ways in which films expanded the notion of militarization beyond its literal, physical meaning, toward the antagonist presumptions at the heart of space exploration. In doing so, I point to the ways in which the history Soviet science fiction cinema should be treated both as a historically grounded and a richly imaginative genre. Chapter two reconsiders Soviet space science fiction from the perspective of space utopianism and the notions of utopian impulse, utopian desire, and utopia as hypothetical presence. The chapter questions the very tenants\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxix\n\nof Soviet fictional societies oriented into space by first revisiting Yakov Protazanov’s Aelita, famously proclaimed as “the first Soviet science fiction blockbuster.” Building on excellent analyses of the film—a tale of a workers’ revolution on Mars, hijacked by the Martian princess Aelita—provided by scholars, such as Ian Christie and Andrew J. Horton, the chapter argues for the need to address Aelita in the context of the later developments of the genre of science fiction cinema in the Soviet context.35 Reading Aelita alongside later productions, such as Tumannost’ Andromedy, Solyaris, and Chetvertaia planeta (The Fourth Planet) (1995), unveils several continuities that distinguish the notion of utopia in Soviet science fiction cinema.36 The dialectics of utopia and dystopia within the overall framework of utopian impulse and desire is discussed with particular attention to the functions of various strangers and others, such as women and alien life-forms. It is also pointed out how both the conceptions of utopia, and the functions of strangers and others support or subvert official state policies. The third chapter continues the discussion of utopianism by stressing another important aspect of Soviet sf: its uneasy relation with the artistic canon of socialist realism, imposed by the Communist Party in 1934, and the conflictlessness of socialist realist sf. Socialist realism relegated sf to depictions of the so-called near future; this accounts for the relative unpopularity of the genre in cinema in the 1930s–late 1950s, when this constraining policy was democratized under Khrushchev’s government. Nevertheless, several interesting space-oriented productions were released even in the period of socialist-realism-marked cultural production. Notably, Kosmicheskii reis (The Cosmic Voyage) (1936) directed by Vasily Zhuravlev and consulted by Soviet rocket engineering pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovskii portrayed space travel as an imminent, nearing reality, and served as the springboard for a great number of popular-scientific films on the nearing future in space.37 Sometimes, such films would spill over into the genre of science fiction for younger audiences, such as Viktor Morgenshtern’s la byl sputnikom solntsa (I Was a Satellite of the Sun) (1959), released soon after the end of the socialist realist era, yet still heavily influenced by its narrative conventions.38 This chapter focuses on this particular subgenre of space-exploration science fiction films, investigating the aforementioned features alongside lateThaw productions, the somewhat “static” utopias of Nebo zovet and Mechte navstrechu (A Dream Come True) (1963).39 This chapter thus investigates the value hierarchies underpinning the Soviet imagination of space exploration. Chapter 4 proceeds from the static utopias of the 1960s to an examination of their Others, linking the productions from the previous chapter to those from the following decade. The 1960s, marked by the greatest feats of the Soviet space program, as well as by the post-Stalinist notable increase in artistic freedom, saw a significant expansion of the archive of Soviet science\n\nxxx\n\nIntroduction\n\nfiction cinema. In tune with contemporary political developments, the majority of Soviet sf films from the 1960s and early 1970s were inspired by the prospect of a future that would entail the exploration and colonization of other planets. At the same time, many of these films (e.g., adaptations of Polish writer Stanislaw Łem’s prose) proceeded toward this aim with great caution, warning about the possible dangers of such experiments. Films, such as Irina Povolotskaya’s Tainstvennaia stena—the first Soviet sf directed by a female director—and Zvezdnyi inspektor (The Star Inspector) (1980) and Petlia Oriona (The Orion Loop) (1980), as well as another Łem adaptation, Doznanie pilota Pirksa (The Inquest of Pilot Pirx) (1979) presented an entire typology of contemporary perceptions of otherness, ranging from antagonist (often foreign) humans to antagonist machines, cyborgs, and aliens.40 The fourth chapter of the book discusses this palette of socially acknowledged and stigmatized creatures in the context of theories, viewing sf as a social allegory, even a mirror of contemporary social conflicts, rather than a predictive genre. Chapter 5 focuses on children’s and teen Soviet sf films, which present a notable segment of Soviet science fiction cinema, particularly from the 1970s and 1980s. Productions, such as Richard Viktorov’s Moskva–Kassiopeia (Moscow–Cassiopea) and Otroki vo vselennoi (Teens in the Universe) (1973, 1974), Valentin Selivanov’s Bol’shoe kosmicheskoie puteshestvie (The Great Space Voyage) (1975), as well as Pavel Arsionov’s Lilovyi shar (The Lilac Ball) (1987), to name a few, reinforce the link between the conquest of outer space and children as basic tenants of the anticipated Soviet communist future.41 Indeed, these films typically portray child-cosmonauts as the imminent future of space exploration. Accordingly, while accounting for the need to sate the audience’s curiosity and to cater to its needs for entertainment, well recognized by post-Thaw film authorities and filmmakers, these productions remain infused with a clear pedagogical and a patriotic note. The ways in which childhood has been portrayed in post-Soviet youth-oriented science fiction cinema is strikingly different: the children of Oleg Kompasov’s Aziris-Nuna (Aziris-Nuna) (2006) or the teens of Fedor Bondarchuk’s Pritiazhenie (The Attraction) (2017) were no longer automatically burdened with the future of humanity, unless they specifically choose to take it on as their concern.42 Nevertheless, in Soviet and post-Soviet science fiction cinema alike, childhood as a trope remained a liminal terrain. Having the privileged role of “the future,” children are, at the same, strangely absent from and alien to the present—unlike their representations in other cinematic genres. This chapter explores the different modes of being a child in Soviet and post-Soviet science fiction cinema, focusing on the transformations in positionalities, narratives, and aesthetics of the aforementioned films, at least partly accounting for the broader context of youth policies. In doing so, it\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxxi\n\nalso points to the stable presence of mythical and fairy tale narratives in the universe of Soviet sf. Chapter 6 explores continuities between the Soviet tradition of science fiction, influenced by the socialist-realist canon, and post-Soviet Russian takes on the genre. The chapter proceeds through a detailed examination of outer space–themed films in the genre of Soviet sf (Lunnaia raduga [Moon Rainbow] [1983], Kin-Dza-Dza!, Podzemelie ved’m, and, to an extent, Vozvrashchenie s orbity [Return from Orbit] [1983]), analyzing the films in terms of their aesthetics, intertextual references to earlier Soviet politicized sf, and post-Soviet Russian science fiction, and in terms of their production context, in order to develop three points.43 First, that Soviet science fiction of the period may be seen as a culmination of the trajectories outlined by the genre of earlier Soviet sf cinema, if coupled with the canon of socialist realism: if Kin-Dza-Dza! embodied the dystopian, cyberpunk end of the spectrum, Lunnaia raduga appeared to be a careful exploration of the pitfalls of relying entirely either on science or on fantasy. Second, that the aesthetics of these perestroika films, which reached from reappropriations of the canons of the Hollywood blockbuster (Podzemelie ved’m ) to Dadaist anti-philosophy (Kin-Dza-Dza!), greatly influenced post-Soviet cinema on outer space, if not post-Soviet Russian science fiction cinema (e.g., Mishen’ [Target] [2011]) on the more general level of genre.44 Third, that the production context of the perestroika favored a turn in thematic preferences: from outer space–themed science fiction, Soviet sf as a cinematic genre started showing more interest in terrestrial science fiction, while space-related fictions began expressing a greater concern for the challenges of space exploration to the human psyche (notable in Vozvrashchenie s orbity). The seventh chapter follows the loose historical trajectory of the book, focusing on the first decade of Russian post-Soviet feature films on outer space. Departing from the fact that, on post-Soviet screens, space exploration no longer featured as a horizon of the future, it examines the few films on space, produced in the 2000s, in terms of their chronotopicality. In doing so, it asserts that the chronotope of outer space in the imaginary of these postSoviet productions differs greatly from all of the space-related chronotopes of the Soviet era, and is closer to that of the post-Soviet province. The chapter provides close readings of three contemporary Russian films on outer space, Kosmos kak predchuvstvie (Dreaming of Space) (2005), Bumazhnyi soldat (Paper Soldier) (2008), and Pervye na lune (First on the Moon) (2005), arguing that they turn the entire world (with a descriptive emphasis on the USSR) into the provinces, insofar as the provinces may be understood as a structural characteristic, a relation between the center and the periphery.45 Furthermore, I elaborate on how these cinematic provinces were marked by three different kinds of provincialism: provincialism of the subject (Kosmos\n\nxxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nkak predchuvstvie), provincialism of memory, where memory is turned into a fairy tale (Pervye na lune), and provincialism of universal axiology (Bumazhnyi soldat). The chapter thus demonstrates how outer space as the site of the Soviet communist utopia is effectively turned inside-out in early twenty-first-century Russian productions, and thereby critically engaged with on the levels of genre, memory politics, and related ethical concerns. The final chapter focuses on the past decade of Russian features that address the question of space exploration. Taking into account the curious circumstance that recent films on figures and events from the Soviet history of spaceflight are often counterintuitively described as science fiction, this chapter investigates the fictionalization of the space age in contemporary Russian spaceflight history blockbusters Gagarin. Pervyi v kosmose (Gagarin. First in Space) (2013), Vremia pervykh, and Salyut 7.46 This “second wave” of Russian films on spaceflight exhibited a greater affinity for the patriotic Soviet canon of portraying Soviet spaceflight history than their predecessors from the 2000s, examined in the previous chapter. This chapter argues that blockbusters of the past decade reinvent the patriotic Soviet narrative in a particular, no(w)stalgic way. Expanding the discussion on the chronotope of outer space in Soviet and Russian cinema, this chapter explores the productions in question through the lens of their constructions of literal and metaphorical diagonality, verticality, and horizontality. Drawing on recent scholarship on the intersections between nostalgia and utopia studies, the chapter argues that the examined films embedded historical events into fictional narratives and audio-visual worlds that monumentalize and mythologize the Soviet space age through the use of these spatial vectors, creating a novel yet eerily familiar fictional collage of a past.\n\nNOTES 1.

The main aim of this chapter is to outline how prominent themes in Soviet space science fiction cinema relate to the historical developments in international science fiction cinema, in order to sketch out the scene for the discussions that will follow later in the book. It seems appropriate to begin by reiterating the conclusion of many recent studies on astroculture: namely, that the conception of outer space thematized in policies and cultural products across the globe—for both entertainment and education—is usually a reflection, or extrapolation, of earthly concerns.1 At the same time, it is a common contemporary expectation of science fiction to challenge familiar stereotypes, preconceptions, and expectations of human future in space. Indeed, as Shukaitis reminded us, why imagine the future to be akin to the present if the present is not “the best of all possible worlds”?2 Why imagine outer space as an extrapolation of Earth or strive to turn it into such an extrapolation? Why transpose terrestrial conflicts into outer space, transforming it into a gamelike battlefield? As an unexplored, unconquered horizon, a vast and virtually unlivable environment, outer space may serve as a good prop to spice up a box-office blockbuster or as a didactic aide, allowing the director to convey, in allegorical terms, a certain political message. From this perspective, it is unsurprising that numerous twentieth-century science fiction films set in outer space demonstrate an awareness of connections that space exploration had with the development of military technologies and with the context of contemporary military and political conflicts, namely the two world wars, the Cold War and the disintegration of the Eastern bloc. However, this chapter aims to demonstrate that—if approached from a decentralized, transnational perspective—science fiction cinema reveals the spacescape of the twentieth 1\n\n2\n\nChapter 1\n\ncentury and the militaristic dimension of space programs as belonging to a set of thematic preoccupations. Political and legal experts usually define space militarization as policies and acts that involve placing weapons and technologies that may serve aggressive ends into space beyond the atmosphere of planet Earth.3 From the perspective of popular culture analysis, this definition appears rather narrow. This is because military or violent conflicts in the space created by the genre of science fiction are only partly conditioned by the actual presence of weapons and different kinds of technologies in outer space. The space of fiction usually focuses less on creating precise analogies to political and technological reality and more on conveying allegorical meanings. In this sense, a look at popular culture allows one to broaden the definition of space militarization. Science fiction films of the twentieth century demonstrate how the presence of violence and military weapons in space is conditioned by sets of relations: political international relations as well as those between genders, races, and individuals. This broadened perspective on the question of militarization allows us to chart a terrain for a more nuanced discussion of Soviet and Russian science fiction cinema, which will follow in the next chapters. In this chapter, I would therefore like to point out the transnational and global questions that have contributed to the general image of outer space as a frightening and violent medium, which prevails in discussions on science fiction cinema and its history today. Against the common assumption that most of Soviet space science fiction cinema revolves around the Cold War race for space, I refer to a broad range of films produced on both sides of the Iron Curtain in order to argue that we can explore at least four different evident categories of antagonisms that underpin the producers’ approaches to activities in space: ideological, geopolitical, psychological, and biopolitical antagonisms. While these metaphorical battlefields are predictably in line with major international political preoccupations of the twentieth century, that is, the Russian revolution and the communist threat, the Cold War divide, the rise of minority rights movements, and the global expansion of capitalism, they also produce specific versions of outer space as constellations of space and time, also often described as timespaces or chronotopes, to echo Mikhail Bakhtin.4 While violence played an important role in all these constructions, it did so with reference to specific dimensions of astroculture: its varying ideological backdrops and geopolitical references, its interplay with the human imagination and the underlying presumptions about values and morals, and, finally, its attitude toward the very basic definition of life. Rather than aiming at providing a systematic overview of space science fiction cinematography, this chapter foregrounds a number of selected films in order to approach, illustrate, and develop the overarching conceptual issue: the interplay of representations of current sociopolitical reality and\n\nSoviet Space and the Battlegrounds\n\n3\n\nimagination in cinematic depictions of militarized outer space. Relying on relatively well-known films, I argue that while science fiction cinema of the previous century represented current political preoccupations, it also contributed to space militarization by normalizing the image of the omnipresence of danger and violence in space or coming from space. Over the course of the century, the image of outer space as a potentially dangerous and therefore a violent setting, often even a battlefield gradually turned into a common presumption, and a widely used trope in popular culture. Plotting the history of Soviet and Russian science fiction cinema into this broader framework is, in my view, important in order to be able to later switch between the registries of national and transnational cultural memories of the space age. PROFESSORS, SELENITES, AND MARTIAN PRINCESSES: THE PRE-CANONICAL, ANTI-COLONIALIST YEARS The advent of space science fiction cinema is often associated with Georges Méliès’s short film Voyage dans la Lune (1902), and what could be seen as its 1898 prequel, La Lune à un mètre (The Astronomer’s Dream), a short reverie about an astronomer’s dream about “looking the moon straight in the eye.”5 Méliès’s two fin-de-siècle depictions of humans’ first ventures into outer space were products of and comments on the advent of modernity, accompanied by the emergence of various workers’ rights movements and searches for alternatives to the existent economic system. Moreover, the lengthier and more elaborate Voyage dans la Lune may in restrospect also be seen as a premediator—a “trend-setter” that will be honored and referred to by many later films—for different subgenres of contemporary science fiction cinema.6 Both shorts located the ambitions to reach the moon at the intersection of the then contemporary “state-of-the-art” in science with imagination. Numerous critics have noted the parodic appearance of the astronomers in the two films; their visions and apparent lunacy in the film were explicitly coupled with imperialist ambitions of the state. Not only did no one have a problem with launching a cannonball-shaped capsule into outer space, aiming at the anthropomorphic moon and hitting the Man in the Moon in his eye. Professor Barbenfouillis, played by Méliès himself, also received a monument erected in his honor upon successful return to Earth with a captive moon-dweller, a Selenite. The short silent film was met with great enthusiasm by French audiences and was equally successful in the United States, where pirated versions by Lubin, Selig, and Edison ensured its great distribution. By 1904, it had also been widely screened in Germany, Canada, and Italy.7 The film provided a satirical critique of political order and pointed to the limits and dangers\n\n4\n\nChapter 1\n\ninherent to blind faith in scientific progress. Humanity only ventures to the moon to find out what it looks like to be atop a foreign planet. The earthlings were completely ignorant of all kinds of non-anthropomorphic extraterrestrial life that they encountered along the way, like the Man in the Moon or the Selenites, which appeared to explode when physically attacked. Humanity, represented in full only by mature bourgeois males, flew off into space absolutely certain of its intellectual and physical supremacy. It nearly destroys a foreign culture and returns to Earth to rejoice the triumphs based on the astronomers’ rational calculations as well as human courage and supremacy over the Selenites. The narrative, commenting on the colonialist and imperialist political context of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, will be revisited by countless later science fiction film, based on the premise that science and military power are key to humanity’s victory over all possible extraterrestrial threats. The explicitly satirical tone adopted by Voyage dans la Lune, however, is notably less common in these later productions. Critics have suggested that Voyage dans la Lune may be seen as an anti-imperialist parody, a function that would later feature only in very specific subgenres, such as space musicals or late 1980s Soviet productions, such as Kin-DzaDza! (1986), which will be analyzed in chapter 6.8 Furthermore, Voyage dans la Lune was produced long before the codification of the now-classical cinematic gestures, such as close-ups, juxtapositions, the tracking shot, and the shot-reverse-shot sequence; early cinema scholar André Gaudreault helpfully reminded us that films from the beginning of the twentieth century actually provided a very different viewing experience, closer to the tradition of the féerie theater-spectacle than to classical narrative cinema, which only became popular toward the 1920s.9 Voyage dans la Lune did not operate with a conventional linear narrative but rather treated time and space as flexible parameters, which allowed to show the voyage to the moon in two sequences from two different perspectives.10 Méliès created a visually rich spectacle, which allowed the spectator to enjoy fantastic, innovative shots of imagined situations, places, and times, transposing the tradition established in the literary genre of science fiction to a new medium.11 Equally important, Méliès’s film predicted that space exploration would probably be the result of the development of military technologies. Therefore, even this forerunner of the science fiction spectacle links the very idea of space exploration to military pursuits. Furthermore, aggressive, armed ventures into space were depicted as a consequence of a colonialist attitude exhibited by the protagonists of the film. They came to the moon unarmed but were happy to use their umbrellas against the Selenites once they realized this was an efficient means of destroying them. Early space science fiction films also include the first space opera prototype, the Danish silent film Himmelskibet (A Trip to Mars) (1918); literary\n\nSoviet Space and the Battlegrounds\n\n5\n\nadaptations, such as H. G. Wells’s The First Men in the Moon (1919) and the revolutionary allegory Aelita (1924)—which will be explored in the following chapter—as well as the scientifically rigorous first space melodrama Frau im Mond (Woman in the Moon) (1929).12 With regard to their formal features, aesthetics and narratives, these films were much less ambiguous than Voyage dans la Lune. They signaled a solidification of a transnational visual culture of outer space within the Western imaginary, demonstrating that, although outer space might be portrayed in an expressionist (Frau im Mond, Aelita) or a more realist-futurist manner (The First Men in the Moon), it was already constructed as the ultimate battlefield, featuring the struggles of a prevalent conception of society against extraterrestrials, imperialists, capitalists, or others. Notably, for contemporary analysts, these films demonstrated a heightened awareness of the need of sociopolitical critique. While the critical attitude remained relatively covert in Western European productions, early, pre–World War II Soviet films featured a much more pronounced degree of sociopolitical engagement. Of course, an ample amount of anti-capitalist and pro-communist propaganda in the USSR in the 1920s and early 1930s is hardly surprising; much more so are cases where such propaganda was openly mocked. The year 1924 was marked by the release of two films based on Alexei Tolstoy’s novel Aelita, which imagined a communist revolution on Mars: the homonymic Aelita, directed by Yakov Protazanov, which I will return to in detail in chapter 2, and Mezhplanetnaia revoliutsia (Interplanetary Revolution), an envisaged animated insert into Aelita, which, however, directly parodied Protazanov’s adaptation.13 In the latter silent animated short, Red Army Soldier Comrade Kominternov followed a bourgeois mission to Mars in order to prevent capitalist rule over the red planet, initiating a communist revolution instead. Interestingly enough, both parties in the class struggle were portrayed with the same amount of mockery: the bourgeois resembled bulldogs, which regard outer space as their new “final frontier,” full of resources and therefore ready for their lucrative ventures, whereas the ideologically drugged communists appeared one-dimensional and emotionally void. The ways in which the directors—young avant-garde Soviet animators—played with narrative structures, explicit and implicit social critique as well as outworldly fantasies made this experimental animation function in a very similar way to Voyage dans la Lune. However, in contrast to Méliès’s work, Mezhplanetnaia revoliutsia was never finished and did not make it to film theaters, leaving Aelita, a slightly less politically problematic adaptation of Tolstoy’s novel, the only mark of early Soviet cinematic astroculture.14 The combination of swift technological progress (coupled with enthusiasm) in the domain of rocketry and the absence of a strictly codified cinematic language allowed for an unprecedented degree of experimentation\n\n6\n\nChapter 1\n\non screen. Nevertheless, space in these early science fiction films, which were produced long before the first tangible results of space programs, consistently—and very much in line with contemporary colonialist/socialist scenarios—appeared as a somewhat generic, unexplored terrain that would need to be tamed by military means. The decades that followed led to significant changes in the imagery of outer space, which offered conflict, warfare, and violence within very specific timespaces.15 This can be explained by the gradual establishment of film genres with distinct features, audiences, and marketing strategies as well as the appearance of distinct film policies, particularly in the USSR and socialist-bloc Eastern Europe, where film policy was governed by state agencies, ideologically aligned with the policies of the ruling Communist Parties. THE AMERICAN SEARCH FOR THE ULTIMATE OTHER, THE “CLASSICAL SCIENCE FICTION BLOCKBUSTER” RECIPE, AND THE DECADES OF SILENCE IN THE EASTERN BLOC While pre–World War II space-themed science fiction cinema focused on the ways outer space futures could broaden humanity’s horizons beyond the constraints of contemporary political regimes, postwar science fiction took a different turn. As the day of the launch of the first satellite and manned spaceflights drew nearer, the Soviet film industry remained cautious of the genre of science fiction after the Stalinist canonization of socialist realism as the normative framework for all artistic productions. The science fiction of socialist realism, which heavily influenced film production until the late 1950s, was to examine potentially realizable “near futures.” Moreover, in the domain of film production, it did not have separate funds but was most commonly associated with films for younger audiences. These two circumstances explain both the scarcity of productions and the pronounced focus on utopian future scenarios, exhibited by films, such as la byl sputnikom solntsa and Nebo zovet, which shall be analyzed in chapter 3. Meanwhile, Hollywood released a number of spectacular, albeit somewhat dystopian features, such as When Worlds Collide (1951), The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invaders from Mars (1953) and War of the Worlds (1953), known today as some of the most iconic science fiction films of the 1950s.16 Although at first glance, these genre films utilized the very same recipe perfected by their prewar predecessors—a pinch of threat and the atmosphere of an impending disaster—the tone and the message of these postwar films was starkly different. If Soviet productions advertised a firm belief in the nearing triumph of Soviet science in space, leading to Soviet authority over the entire\n\nSoviet Space and the Battlegrounds\n\n7\n\nworld, 1950s Hollywood science fiction explicitly emphasized the possible existence of a serious external threat to a familiar society and therefore justified the need for further internal social consolidation. The spectacle portrayed by many 1950s American space-themed science fiction films was ultimately the feat of order, collaboration, and transparency over an unidentified or a vaguely identified threat. As noted by Vivian Sobchack, the trope of the city, an ordered and consolidated urban space, played an important role in science fiction films such as The Day the Earth Stood Still, that is, films that aim at reconciling human and alien (or unknown) power.17 Miranda Banks has argued that “countless science fiction films use easily recognizable foreign landmarks in montage / to show the international scale of the events taking place within the film. These single spaces speak not only to the residents’ experience but rather show the solidarity of all nations: What happens to one will happen to all.”18 Alongside this internationalist undercurrent, the universe of Hollywood 1950s science fiction cinema heavily relied on the dichotomy of the inside versus the outside. Contemporary analysts agreed that the increased rate of science fiction film production of the 1950s was in direct relationship to the increasing public concern about communism and the fear of nuclear disaster.19 For instance, the 1950 production Destination Moon, praised for its technological accuracy and box-office popularity, states that private investments into the space program are necessary for the United States to “win” the moon race against the USSR, turning outer space into an extrapolation of a political conflict (the early Cold War) on Earth.20 The General in the film states, directly quoting Wernher von Braun, “The first country that can use the moon to launch missiles will control the earth. And that, gentlemen, is the most important military fact of this century.”21 The Day the Earth Stood Still was an equally illustrative case.22 The alien Klaatu (Michael Rennie) arrived on Earth to warn earthlings that their escalating belligerence and inability to coexist peacefully would not be tolerated by the interstellar community. In contrast, Klaatu’s own futuristic alien community protected itself from armed conflict by subjugating itself to robot guardians. Utopia came at a price: the technologically advanced alien race bought peace at the expense of confining itself to a panopticon. The film suggested that this was the only alternative to incessant wars, which eventually lead to the elimination of the society in question. In this respect, The Day the Earth Stood Still offered a complex analysis of the problem of technological progress, coupling it with the context of the eternal and unchanging problem of social antagonisms and political conflicts. According to the director Robert Wise, the film had elements of a biblical allegory, with Klaatu functioning as a Christ-like figure reacting both to the recent World War II and the Cold War.\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\nA similarly nuanced perspective on the future of modernity, characterized by the technological advances, was provided by the 1960 East German production Der schweigende Stern (The Silent Star).23 Distributed as First Spaceship on Venus in the United States, and set in 1985, this film focused on the role of the international community of scientists in discovering evidence of a Venusian presence on Earth. Having sent a spaceship to Venus, humans would realize the Venusians, once a powerful race that had harbored a plan to eradicate humanity and invade Earth, were gone. The race destroyed itself with its own atomic weapons, its ruins serving as a warning to earthlings. In contrast to productions such as The Day the Earth Stood Still, this film, an adaptation of Stanisław Łem’s novel, had a much more pronounced internationalist note. Not only did the space crew consist of scientists of various nationalities, but their journey through the ruins of Venusian civilization serves as a clear visual allegory to post–World War II Earth. Der schweigende Stern used the genre of science fiction and the trope of the Venusians to create an otherworldly allegory of the perils inherent to humanity’s thirst for physical, symbolic, and technological domination. Other space-themed science fiction films from this period were less farreaching in this regard, portraying outer space as a simple extrapolation of the Cold War antagonism. The War of the Worlds (1953) used a Martian invasion as a cue for a visually excessive thriller, wherein humanity, embodied by the inhabitants of a town in Arizona, is attacked by a clearly violent alien aggressor, only to seek salvation in love and prayer. The threat was removed by nature itself: the Martians succumbed to microbes and bacteria present in the Earth’s atmosphere. Invaders from Mars (1953) went a step further to clearly couple the Martian threat with the Soviet one. Martian invaders, like a McCarthyist “red scare,” indoctrinated humans and took over their brains.24 Incidentally, the way in which Soviet space cinema from the same period was preoccupied with the Cold War divide was notably different. As we will see in the following chapters, while science fiction films were a rare find until the 1960s, the few productions that did address space exploration were markedly internationalist. The first iconic post-Sputnik space-documentary film, Pavel Klushantsev’s Doroga k zvezdam (The Road to the Stars), clearly stated that the space age was the future of all humanity.25 At the same time, this “documentary” film monumentalized the future by incorporating it into a narrative about the history of space exploration. While this history (and future) was clearly tied to Soviet signifiers, it was also depicted as a universal, global feat.26 Similarly, one of the most popular Soviet space science fiction films of the 1950s, Nebo zovet, a tale of the imagined and desired future of the Soviet space program (i.e., a flight to Mars) tellingly envisaged eventual collaboration between the United States and the USSR, albeit clearly under the aegis of the latter.\n\nSoviet Space and the Battlegrounds\n\n9\n\nIn contrast to these Soviet and American films, Western European productions of this period did not depict the militarization of outer space as a result of current political constellations or use the metaphor of an alien threat to demonize a contemporary political other. Rather, outer space was a fantastic arena for mixing genres, intertextual references and, ultimately, for producing “notoriously bad” films.27 Such productions were evidently inspired by genres such as horror and satire and often focused on how space exploration might foreground and question traditional dichotomies, sometimes with unconventional results. In a representative 1956 low-budget UK production, Fire Maidens from Outer Space, a crew of stereotypically macho, heavily smoking astronauts from Earth landed on the thirteenth moon of Jupiter to explore signs of life that have recently been discovered there.28 They encountered a dying civilization, consisting of sixteen women and their middleaged symbolic father Prasus. The people were being terrorized by a beastly headed monster. This dying population was led by Duessa, who also initially wished to retain the astronauts in captivity, using them as mates. However, they prove to be very useful, killing the monster who had murdered Prasus and several women in his latest attack. The astronauts left the hostile moon with one of the women and promised to send spaceships full of men to the forsaken celestial body. Male physical strength and virility proved to be crucial for the future of civilization, both terrestrial and alien. Moreover, this film, like many others, portrayed the possibly alien inhabited pockets in outer space as dangerous places that must be approached bearing fire arms. Even in these humorous films of the first half of the 1950s, the visions of space exploration and extraterrestrial encounters depict space programs as the result of technological progress, brought about by a social order organized and ruled by males. In this situation, space exploration is limited to being a colonialist pursuit. Technological progress was not aligned with a pluralist, open attitude toward novel forms of life or social order. Both the aliens and the expeditions from Earth were, by default, armed with lethal weapons intended for the destruction of anything considered to be alien. Forbidden Planet was released in 1956, a year after both the United States and the USSR had declared their intentions to launch artificial satellites in the near future, catapulting them into the beginning of the Space Race.29 Apart from combining many of the themes and tropes highlighted by the films already mentioned, Forbidden Planet set new precedents that later films in this genre would successfully continue to exploit, along with a fully electronic score composed by Louis and Bebe Barron. Much like Destination Moon, Forbidden Planet glorified the technological advances of the human race, rating them higher than those of alien life forms. The film, set in the twenty-third century, featured a human crew traveling in a spaceship fasterthan-light, accompanied by Robby the Robot, the first-ever opinionated,\n\n10\n\nChapter 1\n\nanthropomorphic robot to appear in a space science fiction film. The expedition was set out to check on an earlier mission to Altair IV.
