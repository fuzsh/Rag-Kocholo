NAMED Kumar Ganguly on birth, he became known to the world as Kishore Kumar and was considered one of the most successful playback singers of Indian films. Kishore died in Mumbai on Oct 13, 1987, at the age of 58 after his 41 years fully- engaged association with the film industry.

He was a most versatile artist and contributed to the films also as an actor, lyricist, composer, producer, director, screenplay and script writer but singing continued to be his forte. Kishore would prefer light comedy roles in films unlike his elder brother Ashok Kumar, who was famous for serious and thought-provoking roles.

There are hundreds of superhit songs sung by Kishore in his heavy but charming voice ideally suited for film singing. It, therefore, becomes difficult to quote a few as his best songs. He was most happy singing hilarious and jolly songs but did equal justice to sad ones depicting a broken heart. He was the only playback singer amongst his contemporaries who displayed the art of yodeling in his songs, which he had learnt from “Tex” Morton and Jimmie Rodgers, country singers of the early last century from the West.

Kishore started his cinema career as a chorus singer at Bombay Talkies and his first film appearance was in Shikari in 1946, in which brother Ashok played the lead role. Music director Khemchand Prakash gave him a chance to sing Marne ki duayen kyon mangoon for the film Ziddi (1948). He sang for all the leading actors of his time on compositions of the top melody makers. However, maestro S.D. Burman had a great liking for Kishore’s voice and singing style and there are innumerable memorable songs to their credit.

Efforts of both produced hits like Jeewan ke safar mein rahi (Munimji); Mana janab ne pukara naheen (Paying Guest), and many duets with Asha.

Kishore holds the record for winning the Filmfare Award in the category of ‘Best Male Playback Singer’ eight times.
