        "text": "Think of Kishore Kumar and the first thing that comes to mind is his exuberant joie de vivre as a singer, performer and mercurial genius. Privately, however, the legendary singer-actor-filmmaker was neither gregarious nor worried about how his silences would be judged.\n\nHis fans across the country are celebrating his 89 birth anniversary this month. On Kishoreda's birthday (August 4), the who’s who of Bollywood took to social media to pay tribute to the legend. The Shahanshah of Bollywood, Amitabh Bachchan, wrote, \"4th August, birth anniversary of Kishore Kumar .. a versatile genius .. Prod, Dir, Actor, Singer, Music Dir Kishoreda sang in more than 51 films for me, as my voice - more than 130 songs. and in more than 60 films that I acted in.\"\n\nKishore Kumar\n\nAmit Kumar finds it difficult to hold back tears whenever he remembers the last time he saw his father, in October 1987 when he was leaving for a concert in the US. Kishore Kumar had not been keeping well. He looked tired, but Amit remembers there was an expression of inexplicable calmness on his face that night. A few days later, on October 13, Kishore Kumar suffered a fatal heart attack. He was only 58 years old.\n\nKishoreda lived a life no less spectacular than a Bollywood masala film. He was the youngest of four siblings born to Bengali parents, Kunjalal Ganguly and Gauri Devi. His ancestral home, Gaurikunj, where he grew up with his brothers, is still a popular landmark in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh. He was a lively child who was passionate about singing. He was especially obsessed with legendary singer and composer KL Saigal, and learnt music by imitating his style. In fact, while he was growing up in Khandwa, his father, a lawyer, would tell him to entertain their guests with the songs of Saigal and older brother Ashok Kumar. Kishore would charge 25 paise for each of Dadamoni’s songs and Re 1 per Saigal song.\n\nWith Lata Mangeshkar at a Filmfare Award function\n\nFinding his voice\n\nA collector\n\nRumour has it\n\nChoppy waters\n\nUnscripted genius\n\nFinding his voice\n\nKishore had no formal training in music and Ashok Kumar, who was already a film star, discouraged him from taking up a playback career. He felt that Kishore’s voice lacked ‘modulation’, among other things. But Kishore was in no mood to hang up his boots. It is said that he spent many a night at Dadar station in Mumbai when he was struggling to find work.\n\nKhemchand Prakash, a noted Bollywood composer in the 1940s, gave him his first break. His career in Bollywod began with a song for Dev Anand in Ziddi in 1948. This was also the film where Lata Mangeshkar and Kishore Kumar sang a duet for the first time. Taking a trip down the memory lane, the Nightingale of India told Filmfare in 1964, “I met him towards the end of 1947 during a recording for Khemchand Prakash’s Ziddi. He was a beginner and I was not very far ahead. We used to travel together in a third class compartment and Kishore would clown and mimic incessantly.”\n\nKishore Kumar at his Mumbai residence\n\nDuring a 2014 interview with The Times of India, living legend Asha Bhonsle too recalled their days of struggle, “Let me narrate a funny incident... Both Kishore Kumar and I, early in our careers, went for a duet recording — the sound recordist rejected both of us because we didn't have 'good' voices. Kishore Kumar was very dejected. He joked we should become street singers since we couldn't make it to cinema. I remember consoling him. We worked with renewed vigour, putting our best efforts into our profession — the rest is history.”\n\nIn one of his many moods on screen\n\nBroadcaster Ameen Sayani called Kishore Kumar “an unusual chapter” in his life during an interview with Filmfare. Remembering their old association fondly, he said, “One of my college friends introduced me to Kishoreda, she being a cousin of his first wife Ruma Guha Thakurta. Those days (early ’50s), I wanted to be a singer. Kishoreda and I became friends; we went for parties and picnics together. He’d take us around in his khatara (old) Chalti Ka Naam Gadi car. I’d ask him to sing my favourite number Jagmag jagmag karta nikla (Rimjhim, 1949) and he’d joke, ‘You want to hear Kishore Kumar without paying?’”\n\nIndustry experts say that his real breakthrough came with Aradhana, the 1969 blockbuster. The sensuous Roop Tera Mastana number catapulted him to stardom. Soon after that, he went on to secure unparalleled success in playback singing — 27 of his songs were nominated for Filmfare Awards and he won eight of them. The Kishore-Rajesh Khanna jodi gifted Bollywood music buffs such gems as Pyar deewana hota hai (Kati Patang ,1972), O mere dil ke chain (Mere Jeevan Saathi, 1972) and Jai jai Shiv Shankar (Aap Ki Kasam, 1974). Kishore became the voice for almost all the popular actors of the ’70s and the ’80s, be it Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Shashi Kapoor, Sunil Dutt or Vinod Khanna.\n\nIn one of his many moods on screen\n\nHis association with composer SD Burman was the stuff legends are made of. It was SD Burman who advised him to stop copying Saigal and create his own style of singing. Burman gave Kishore evergreen romantic numbers such as Maana janaab ne pukara nahi (Paying Guest, 1957), Hum hain rahi pyar ke (Nau Do Gyarah, 1957) and Haal kaisa hai janaab ka (Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, 1958), to name a few. Kishore later joined forces with such composers such as RD Burman, Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Kalyanji-Anandji, Bappi Lahiri, Ravi and Khayyam to create unforgettable melodies.\n\nWith his flair for comedy, especially slapstick, he also acted in films with actors like Nutan, Vyjayanthimala and Madhubala. He directed a few movies too, like Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, Badhti Ka Naam Dadhi and Door Ka Rahi.\n\nWith actor Meena Kumari\n\nA collector\n\nHere’s a story that’s a favourite with Kishoreda fans. Once during the early ’80s, he visited a video shack in the US where he kept buying cassettes - in fact, he was almost unstoppable. He even visited the warehouse to pick more cassettes. At the end of his buying spree, it was revealed that Kishoreda had brought VCDs worth a whopping $ 8000. By that time, the owner of the store could recognise him. By an interesting coincidence, celebrated musician and film personality Eddie Murphy had just stepped into the shop when Kishoreda was about to leave. The shack owner introduced Kishore Kumar to him as the ‘Frank Sinatra of India’.\n\nAccording to Amit Kumar, classics such as How Green Was My Valley and The Grapes Of Wrath were among his all-time favourite films. Gary Cooper was said to be his favourite actor and Marlon Brando his idol.\n\nWith son, singer Amit Kumar, in 1981\n\nRumour has it\n\nRD Burman once said that Kishore had a split personality of sorts — a talented musician with madcap antics on one hand, and a gritty practical person on the other. Stories of his thrift are part of Bollywood lore. His third wife, Yogeeta Bali, apparently complained that he would stay up all night counting money. There is a famous story of him turning up on the sets of a film with his head and moustache half shaved off — because the producer paid him only half of his dues! During an interview in 1985 with Pritish Nandy for the Illustrated Weekly Of India, Kishore responded to a question about being ‘crazy for money’ and whether his miserliness was just a facade, thus: “I play different roles at different times. For different people. In this crazy world, only the truly sane man appears to be mad.”\n\nHe didn’t, however, disappoint his friends when they needed his help. It is said that Kishore lent Satyajit Ray Rs 5,000 when he was facing financial difficulties while making Pather Panchali (1955). In a documentary on Kishore Kumar, titled Zindagi Ek Safar, the Oscar-winning filmmaker said that Kishore didn’t charge a penny for singing a Tagore song in Charulata (1964) and two other songs, 20 years later in Ghare Baire (1984). Bengali actor Ruma Guha Thakurta, Kishore’s first wife, was Ray’s niece.\n\nA still from Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi\n\nKishore Kumar was also known to be a loner. He hardly socialised, was said to talk to trees and had a board on his front door that said: Beware of Kishore. But he had a close circle of contemporaries and Amit remembers the likes of SD Burman, RD Burman and Laxmikant- Pyarelal visiting frequently. Indian classical music maestro Vilayat Khan was also one of his friends. Amit remembers Kishore as a doting father. “He was my friend as well. I owe everything to him. Although he gave me a musical platform, he never forced any composer or filmmaker to provide me with an opening in films.”\n\nChoppy waters\n\nKishore suffered many setbacks, financial and otherwise, in his life. Amit talks about the turbulent times during the filming of his father’s directorial venture, Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein, from 1960 to 1964. He played a child artiste in this film, best known for the song 'Aa chal ke tujhe main le ke chaloon'. “He had to endure a lot of adverse remarks from near and dear ones while making this film, but he completed it, against all odds. He watched Ray’s Pather Panchali at least 13 times before making the film. It was also inspired by the Hollywood film, The Proud Rebel.”\n\nKishore Kumar’s personal life, too, was no bed of roses. His first marriage to Ruma was short-lived. His second marriage to Madhubala, with whom he delivered hits like Half Ticket (1962) and Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), is a well-documented romantic saga. During the interview with Pritish Nandy, Kishore said, “For nine long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. And I had to humour her all the time. That’s what the doctor asked me to do. That’s what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.” Kishore’s subsequent marriage to actor Yogeeta Bali was very brief. He later married actor Leena Chandravarkar, who was only two years older than his son.\n\nA still from Padosan\n\nUnscripted genius\n\nAmit says that his father would observe people very closely. Superstar Rajesh Khanna too spoke about this personality trait during a media interview a couple of decades ago. Khanna was then a newcomer selected for Aradhana (1969). Kishore called him to his house one day and started asking him all sorts of questions. He offered him tea after 30 minutes of interrogation, only when he was satisfied with all the answers. Later, Khanna said during the interview that he realised that Kishore dawas actually studying him minutely — a kind of homework that would allow him to match his voice and personality with his role in Aradhana.\n\nKolkata-based music critic Debjit Bandyopadhyay says, “Kishore recorded some songs for the Bengali fi lm Rajkumari (1970), without knowing that he would be singing for Bengal’s legendary actor Uttam Kumar, but was not happy with them. Later, in Amanush (1975), Kishore did a far better job singing for Uttam, because this time he knew who would be lip-syncing.”\n\nAn upright, opinionated person, Kishore was one of the very few artistes in Bollywood who stood openly against Indira Gandhi’s emergency rule. His songs were, at one point of time, banned on All India Radio because he apparently refused to sing at a Sanjay Gandhi rally.\n\nA still from Funtoosh\n\nIndustry insiders say that one of Kishore’s greatest achievements was his contribution to making superstars out of actors like Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan. His improvisations during the recording sessions were famous. In their book, ‘RD Burman The Man, The Music’, authors Aniruddha Bhattacharjee and Balaji Vittal cite the iconic 'Ek Chatur Naar' duet with Manna Dey in Padosan (1968) while discussing Kishore’s spontaneity. During the recording, Kishore came up with the line 'O Tedhe, Seedhe Ho Ja Re' out of the blue, taking Manna by surprise. RD continued with the recording, despite the unscripted lyrics, thus creating a classic.\n\nKishore Kumar still occupies a special place in Hindi cinema. But, surprisingly, there have hardly been any in-depth biographies on him. A few years ago, there were talks in Bollywood about making a biopic. During a trip to Kolkata, actor Ranbir Kapoor once spoke of his eagerness to play the part. And it’s easy to see why. For an actor worth his salt, a complex, colourful character like Kishore Kumar’s would be the role of a lifetime.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS: SOURCE: THE TIMES OF INDIA GROUP, COPYRIGHT (C) 2015, BENNETT, COLEMAN & CO.
