Talking to reporters, Priyadarshan expressed regret that he could not meet the legend.\n\n\"I always wish I could meet him once. This honour is encouraging as I received it in Kishoreda's birthplace,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe award, instituted by MP Department of Culture, carries a cash prize of Rs 2 lakh and a citation, an official of MP Public Relations Department said.\n\nAccording to the official, the Kishore Kumar Samman jury selected noted actor Waheeda Rehman for the award for 2017-18. Minister for Culture Vijaylaxmi Sadho, who was present in Khandwa on Sunday, said the venue and date for honouring Rehman would be announced soon.\n\nKishore Kumar's death anniversary was marked by a large number of people who arrived at his memorial here and played some of his golden hits."
