        "text": "In the world of music, there are stories that transcend melody. There is often an unsung tale at the end of a legendary voice. It is the story of Kishore Kumar, a maestro of Indian playback singing, and the melodious notes he left behind. His last song was given to the world just one day before he untimely passed away.\n\nNew Delhi: Today marks the 36th death anniversary of the legendary playback singer, Kishore Kumar. Although he has always been celebrated for his significant contributions to Indian cinema, few know of his unwavering dedication to music. It may surprise many to learn that the iconic singer recorded his very last song, Guru Guru, just a day before his passing. The duet was recorded in collaboration with another popular singer, Asha Bhosale, for the film Waqt Ki Awaz, starring Mithun Chakraborty and Sridevi. Recording took place at Mehboob Studio on October 12, 1987, and the film was released in 1988.\n\nBappi Lahiri’s Candid Account of Kishore Kumar’s Last Laugh\n\nThe song was composed by the late singer-composer Bappi Lahiri, who, in an interview, shared his experience working with Kishore Kumar on this final recording. Lahiri had noted how Kumar maintained a cheerful atmosphere in the studio while recording Guru Guru because the song was so lively. Bappi Lahiri had also affectionately referred to Kishore Kumar as “mama” and recounted an eerie moment. After the song was recorded and everyone was leaving, Kishore Kumar remarked that many people were laughing now, but who would make them laugh when he wasn’t there? Tragically, he passed away the very next day.\n\nBappi Lahiri had also revealed that he was close to Kishore Kumar’s children, Amit and Sumit Kumar. Referring to Kumar’s influence, Lahiri revealed that Kumar was originally supposed to sing the iconic song Yaad Aa Raha Hai from Disco Dancer. Kumar recorded it later due to a delayed flight. Upon hearing Lahiri’s rendition, Kishore Kumar acknowledged that Lahiri’s version was superior and sung with whole-hearted enthusiasm.\n\nAlso Read: Sam Bahadur: Vicky Kaushal shares new poster of the film ahead of teaser launch\n\nKishore Kumar’s Musical Journey\n\nOn October 13, 1987, Kishore Kumar, the acclaimed singer of songs such as Koi Humdum Na Raha from Jhumroo, Allah Kare Tu Bhi Aa Jaye from Mr. X in Bombay, and Chhedo Na Meri Zulfen from Ganga Ki Lahren, passed away due to a heart attack in his Mumbai flat. The world of music continues to cherish and remember his contributions."
