        "text": "Today marks Kishore Kumar’s 94th birth anniversary. The legendary singer, who has left an indelible mark on the music of Indian cinema, was born on August 4. He also dabbled as an actor and was a part of several films, like 'Padosan' and 'Half Ticket'. His personal life was also a talking point. The singer was married four times, but it was with his last wife, Leena Chandavarkar, that he found happiness.\n\nLeena Chandavarkar, through her interviews and interactions, revealed a lot about Kishore Kumar. From the singer proposing to her on their very first meeting, to taking ‘saat phere’ when she was nine months pregnant, to Kishore Kumar’s last moments, Chandavarkar had shared many anecdotes about him. On the legendary singer’s birth anniversary, let us look back at Kishore Kumar through Leena Chandavarkar’s words and stories that she had shared.\n\nWHEN LEENA REVEALED KISHORE KUMAR PROPOSED TO HER THE FIRST TIME THEY MET\n\nLeena had spoken about how Kishore Kumar had proposed to her the very first time they met. However, she rejected him right away. During her appearance in the dance-based reality show, 'Dance India Dance Li'l Masters' season 5, in 2022, the veteran actress had revealed, “When I first met Kishore Kumar, the first thing he told me was that if I was looking out to settle down in life, he is ready with a proposal. At first, I didn’t realise what he was talking about, but he went on to clarify that he wanted to marry me. I was actually shocked when he said that, but I rejected his proposal immediately.”\n\nShe continued, “After a few weeks, I had an argument with my father when he called me a ‘musibat’ (problem). I was so angry and hurt that I decided to leave my house and get married to someone and live my life. I still remember going to Carter Road (in Mumbai) and calling Kishore ji. I asked him if his (marriage) proposal was still available, and if it was yes, I was ready to get married to him and that’s how we decided to get married.”\n\nLEENA TOOK ‘PHERE’ WITH KISHORE KUMAR WHEN SHE WAS NINE MONTHS PREGNANT\n\nIn a throwback interview with Cineplot in 1997, Leena Chandavarkar had revealed that she had to marry Kishore Kumar twice and she was nine months pregnant the second time. She has said, “I married KK, twice. One was a registered marriage and the other by Vedic rites. My mother felt that a marriage was not solemnized unless the couple took saat pheras... I was nine months pregnant with Sumeet by thenâæ It was funny to see a very pregnant me taking the saat pheras and resting in between the pooja!”\n\nWHEN LEENA REVEALED KISHORE KUMAR’S LAST WORDS\n\nIn the same interview, she had opened up about the day Kishore Kumar passed away, and his ominous last words. “On the morning of October 13 (of 1987), he looked pale and as though in deep sleep. As I went near him, he woke up and asked, ‘Did you get scared? Today is my holiday.’ That day he had several meetings at home. During lunch, he told me that we’d watch the film ‘River Of No Return’ in the evening. A little later, I heard him move furniture in the next room. When I went to see what was happening, I saw him lying on the bed. Nervously he said, ‘I’m feeling weak’. I ran to call the doctor. He got angry and said, ‘If you call the doctor, I’ll get a heart-attack’. Those were his last lines. His eyes were wide open and he was breathing out. I thought he was fooling as usual but that was the end,” she had revealed.\n\nWHEN AMIT KUMAR REVEALED THAT KISHORE KUMAR FOUND HAPPINESS WITH LEENA CHANDAVARKAR\n\nIn an interview with Rediff, Kishore Kumar’s eldest son Amit Kumar revealed that it was with Leena that Kishore Kumar was ‘happy’. He had said, “With Leena Chandavarkar, Baba (father) finally found happinessâæ Baba offered her a role in his film 'Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein', when she had lost her husband (Siddharth Bandodkar) and had come down to Mumbai to complete two pending films. She accepted the film and got out of her depression. She declined his (marriage) proposal, but later impulsively accepted Baba's standing offer.”\n\nLeena Chandavarkar and Kishore Kumar were together for seven years. The former had also admitted sinking into depression after the singer’s death. It is his philosophy that she follows now whenever she feels low. In an interview with TOI, Leena admitted, \"Kishoreji was a pillar of strength who taught me that you win some and lose some. He would show his funny side to the world, but never his sad face. Whenever I feel low, I close the doors, switch on the TV, put the volume loud and have a good cry. Then I have a cup of teaâæ and smile again.”\n\nLeena has a son, Sumeet Kumar, with Kishore Kumar."
