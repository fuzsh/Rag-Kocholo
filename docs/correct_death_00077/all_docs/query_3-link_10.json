        "text": "New Delhi: Legendary singer Kishore Kumar passed away today, 28 years ago on October 13, 1987. He was born as Abhas Kumar Ganguly. He started his career as an actor in Shikari (1946) and the first ever song he sung was “Marne ki duayen kyon mangu” for the film Ziddi (1948). Apart from being a singer, Kishore Kumar was also an actor, screenwriter, director, producer, and composer. Paying an ode to the evergreen gem of cinema on his 34th death anniversary, here are a few of his iconic songs that have been remade in Bollywood films:\n\nMere Sapno Ki Rani\n\nDekha Ek Khwab\n\nEk Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si\n\nHamein Tumse Pyar Kitna\n\n<> </>\n\nSaagar Kinaare\n\n<> </>"
