        "text": "“Duniya kehti hain m ujhko pagal, main kehta hoon duniya ko pagal, par jitna mujhe pagal samjha hain, main utna pagal nahin hoon.”\n\nKishore Kumar.\n\nDerek Bose is the author of Kishore Kumar’s autobiography “Method in Madness”. In his book Derek has illustrated various facets of the legend dividing the chapters into the Actor, the Singer, the Romantic, the Composer and the Entertainer. But he could have easily brought all the chapters under the umbrella of “The Prankster” as this facet of Kishore Kumar’s personality overrides all others.\n\nIn his own words “I muffed my lines; pretended to be crazy, shaved my head, played difficult, began yodelling in the middle of tragic scenes, told Meena Kumari what I was supposed to tell Bina Rai. But they still wouldn’t let me go. I screamed, ranted, and went cuckoo. But who cared? They were just determined to make me a star.”\n\nWhoever said eccentricity, thy name is Kishore Kumar, was indeed very correct. His eccentricities were his only defense system against a cruel, confused world.\n\nOnce, he had asked an interior decorator to come to his house. This decorator came and started spouting his skills without letting him get in a word. This irritated Kishore Kumar and he told the decorator that he wanted a swimming pool right in the middle of the living room along with some monkeys and flowers. The stunned decorator ran out of the house without a second glance.\n\nDuring the shooting of a film called “Miss Mary” with Meena Kumari, he was made to wait endlessly in a hotel room. To teach the filmmakers a lesson, he shaved off his hair! When he appeared on the set, the producer and the director almost collapsed in unison. But Kishore Kumar laughed all the way to the bank.\n\nOnce when a lady gossip writer asked him who his friends were, he took her to his backyard and introduced her to half-a-dozen trees. There they are, he said, Janardhan, Raghunandan, Gangadhar, Jagannath, Budhuram and Jhatpatjhatpat-jhatpat! The lady wrote that he was mad. But the fact is that he was beyond people’s thinking. Being a nature lover he talked to trees, plants, water and birds and his love for nature led him to dig a canal around his house to make it resemble Venice.\n\nHe was paranoid about not being paid. Only after his secretary had confirmed that the payment had been made by the producer would he start singing during recordings. He once landed up for shooting with make up on only one side of his face after discovering that his dues were not fully paid. He answered the director by saying. “ Aadha paisa toh aadha make-up.”\n\nIt was the recording for Heeralal Pannalal in Mehboob Studio with Kishoreda and Asha Bhonsle. It was commonly believed that Kishoreda played truant only when the producer failed to make the payment in advance. But here the payment had been made as signalled by his secretary by a wink and their silently expressed code word. And the music director was the late Panchamda, Kishore’s favorite. Yet, he lost his mood in spite of rehearsing the song for hours together, which he rarely did, came out of the recording room with the ear phone intact on his head, went to the loo, climbed out of the window through a make shift staircase and the car was ready below at the backside wall of the Studio, to make his escape easy. And it took the producer months before he could record the song.\n\nOnce he began practicing in a studio during recording time, after learning that BR Chopra, the director, and not RD Burman, the composer, had thought of the tune for a song.\n\nOn another occasion, when producer R. C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kishore Kumar turned up at Talwar’s residence one morning and started shouting “Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar“. He did this every morning for a few days, until Talwar paid him.\n\nOn the sets of Bhai Bhai, Kishore Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him five thousand rupees. Somehow brother Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene. But, when the shoot started, he walked across the floor and, each time he walked a few places, he said, “Paanch Hazzar Rupaiya,” and did a summersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he went out of the studio, jumped into his car, and ordered his driver Abdul to drive away.\n\nWhile travelling in his car, new tunes would strike him and he would hum it to his driver. And his driver’s duty was to remember the tunes and hum them back in the night to the singer. Kishore Kumar would then work on them. Once the driver couldn’t recall the notes and Kishore Kumar gave him a severe beating. Later he apologized, driving the car himself making the driver sit in the rear seat as if to make up for his earlier behavior.\n\nHe was supposed to record a song for producer-director G.P. Sippy once. Kishore Kumar fled in his car when Sippy approached his house. Sippy chased him all the way to Madh Island where Kishore Kumar eventually stopped, refusing to recognize him and threatened to call the police. Sippy returned home. Next morning an angry Sippy questioned Kishore Kumar as he reported for the recording, who told him calmly that he must have seen a dream as he was in his hometown Khandwa the previous day.\n\nOutside his palatial mansion at Juhu hung a board saying,\n\n“ This is a lunatic asylum” with a small warning sign below\n\n“ Enter at the risk of your own life”.\n\nHrishikesh Mukherjee had gone to his house to cast Kishore Kumar for his film Anand. But he was driven away by his gatekeeper mistaking him for someone else Kishore Kumar had asked to drive away.This incident hurt Hrishikesh Mukherjee so much, that he decided not to work with Kishore Kumar.\n\nHe also had a nameplate with the name of ‘Chhajju Ram’ on it outside his bungalow in Mumbai. Whenever any stranger came to meet him, he would reply, “Kishore ghar par nahin hain “\n\nHe had put a “Beware of Kishore” sign at the door of his Warden Road flat. Once, the producer-director H. S. Rawail, who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kishore Kumar took the money, and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, he put Rawail’s hand in his mouth, bit it, and asked “Didn’t you see the sign?”\n\nTired of his defiance, a producer went to court and got a decree that Kishore Kumar must follow the director’s orders. As a result Kishore Kumar obeyed the director to the letter refusing to alight from his car unless the director told him to do so. He even drove on till Khandala after a car scene in Mumbai because the director forgot to say “ Cut”\n\nDisgusted with his non cooperation during the shoot of Half ticket a financier called Kalidas Batvabbal gave him away to the income tax authorities who raided Kishore Kumar’s house.\n\nLater, Kishore got even by inviting Batvabbal home, tricked him by asking him to enter a cupboard for a “chat” and locked him inside. He unlocked Batvabbal after two hours and told him “Don’t ever come to my house again.”\n\nWhen he died, his wife Leena thought he was still playing a prank as he had collapsed in mid-sentence while laughing and joking. He had suffered a fatal heart attack. It was all over.\n\nBut this genius who could sing,dance,act, mimic,write,compose and make us laugh and cry at the same time will remain etched in our memories forever. Guru we salute you !\n\nThe words of Rabindarnath Tagore hold true for him :\n\n“The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.”"
