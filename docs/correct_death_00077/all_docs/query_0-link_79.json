        "text": "Total Views |\n\nKolkata, June 3: Actor-singer Ruma Guha Thakurta, first wife of singer Kishore Kumar, while straddling an equally successful playback career, died in her sleep early on Monday at her Ballygunge Place residence citing some age-related ailments.\n\n\"She passed away in her sleep early this morning. Our family doctor confirmed it. The timing of her death could be between 6 and 6.15 am,\" said Ayan Guha Thakurta, her son from her second marriage.\n\nThe 84 year old had returned to Kolkata a month ago after staying with Amit Kumar in Mumbai for three months. Her last rites will be performed with state honours and a gun salute, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said after visiting her residence.\n\nRuma, whose film career spans over 60 years, was born on November 3, 1934, in Kolkata. She started her career as a dancer before moving to the then Bombay where she married singer Kishore Kumar in the early 1950s but they got divorced in 1958. She later married writer-director Arup Guha Thakurta and is now survived by her two singer sons Sromona and Ayan. As a playback singer, she lent her voice to a number of films ranging from ‘Lukochuri’ in 1958 to ‘Amrita Kumbher Sandhane in 1982.\n\nRuma founded the Calcutta Youth Choir, a song and dance troupe, in 1958, which is known for its performance of folk and mass songs. The Choir played a key role in popularising songs like ‘Aaj joto juddhabaj’, ‘Bharatbarsho surjer ek naam’, ‘O Ganga boichho keno’ and ‘Waqt ki awaz.\n\nBefore visiting the Guha Thakurta residence, the chief minister in a tweet expressed her grief over the passing away of Ruma.\"Saddened at the passing away of Ruma Guha Thakurta. Her contribution to the field of cinema and music will always be remembered. My condolences to her family and her admirers”, CM Banerjee wrote on her Twitter handle.\n\nUnion Minister Babul Supriyo, actors Rituparna Sengupta and Prosenjit Chatterjee also condoled over the veteran’s death."
