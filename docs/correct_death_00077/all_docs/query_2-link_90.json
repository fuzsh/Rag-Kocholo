Music Director Khemchand Prakash gave Kishore Kumar a chance to sing “Marne Kee Duyein Kyon Maangoon…” for the film “Ziddi” (1948). After this, Kishore was offered many other assignments, but he was not very serious about acting career in films rather he was interested to establish himself as playback singer.
