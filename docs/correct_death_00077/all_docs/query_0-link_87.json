        "text": "By GADFLY\n\nBefore I write about Madhubala’s beauty and her ‘body’ of work, I want to address the issue of Kishore Kumar’s alleged reluctance to go with her to London to explore the possibility of medical treatment. I’ve some first-hand experience of a similar situation. In my college there was a classmate named Joshi (protecting his name) in my class for four years. He was very quiet and kept to himself. We’d just say ‘hi’ when passing through the hallway. The only thing noticeable about him was the condition of his eyes. They were always watery and also a bit sticky. Having no medical knowledge, I thought it must be some minor disorder and never gave it a second thought.\n\nFour years later (1966), in my final year, a few days before the final exams, he suddenly approached me and made an unexpected request. We both had chosen Economics as our major and one of our professors, was a Miss Ritchie, a Canadian (I think) who never smiled and struck terror among us boys because we could hardly understand anything she was saying in her Canadian English.\n\nNow I smile thinking about it but sitting in her class had a diuretic effect on us boys and we all had to wait for the whole hour before rushing to the bathroom. Over four years, I had become a little more comfortable with my English. In our class of 40 majoring in Economics, there were only about 15 boys and hardly 5-6 able to speak English fearlessly without stuttering. I was NOT a bright student with merely fair to middling grades.\n\nI made efforts to talk to Miss Ritchie in her office with some questions, just to get familiar with her accent so as to understand her better in the class. Joshi must have seen that. One day after the class, he talked about the condition of his eyes and said that his was a lower middle class family but the doctors he saw about his eyes had all thrown in the towels.\n\nThey did say, though, that he could seek more expert advice in some Western country. Our finals were approaching and we all knew that Miss Ritchie was retiring and returning to Canada. Joshi wanted me to ask her if she would take his eye reports with her and ask the doctors in her country if anything was possible. The local doctors had already told him that he would have to live with his limited eye-sight indefinitely till he goes blind, which they were not sure would happen in how many years.\n\nI asked Miss Ritchie and she agreed to do it. On our last day in college, I gave her all the eye reports as Joshi stood by smiling awkwardly and saying ‘thank you’ to Miss Ritchie when she said she’d do her best and hoped it helps resolve his problem and that she’d write to me about what the doctors in Canada had to say.\n\nWalking out of her office, on our way home (we both lived in Girgaum, the lower middle class area of Mumbai), I asked Joshi what he plans to do if the Canadian doctors offer hopes. He said, “I’m from a lower middle-class Maharashtrian family and we have no big contacts either in Mumbai or outside. But there are some charities, like the Lions Club that I can approach if there is hope. Then I’ll take it from there. Let's see.”\n\nThe exams lasted till late April and the results came in June. All of us Economics majors made it through, 2 or 3 boys (and 8-9 girls) in second class, which was the highest you could aspire for in that subject. I almost got the second class but missed it by four marks. ‘Almost’ has been the theme of my educational grades. Though that doesn’t matter in the ultimate scheme of things, your educational third-class sticks to you with your degree for the rest of your life.\n\nWith a degree in hand, job search began. Every few days, Joshi would stop by my house (none of us could afford home phones) to ask about the letter from Miss Ritchie. And one day the letter arrived……with bad news…… that nothing could be done. My heart sank. Joshi was not a close friend but he didn’t have to be. How does one break this kind of news to anyone?\n\nIt’s a life-sentence. One can’t but feel the effect of such news. When Joshi next showed up, I told him that I had received the letter but would he first have some tea. No. He just wanted to read the verdict and get out. He probably sensed what was coming. Without pressing the matter, I handed him the letter. He read it as I sat there and showed no emotion. He said he was glad at least he tried, followed by something like ‘I couldn’t have done it without you’, thanked me again and again and before I could say, “Sorry. I wish the news was better,” he left.\n\nMadhubala and Kishore Kumar, unlike Joshi, were rich enough and famous enough to have the necessary contacts. What Madhubala’s biographer doesn’t reveal is that when Kishore Kumar proposed to Madhubala, she was already planning to visit London for treatment. Reportedly, her father wanted her to wait and consult the London doctors first and then marry KK. So on what basis her biographer can blame Kishore for being reluctant to accompany Madhubala is beyond comprehension.\n\nKishore was technically still married to Ruma, his first wife. It is only after the divorce from his wife that he married Madhubala in 1960 in a civil wedding ceremony because of their different religions. Kishore’s disapproving parents refused to attend. So they had a Hindu ceremony. No dice. Kishore’s family never accepted Madhubala. The tension in his house caused immeasurable pain to Kishore and made Madhubala move back to her Bandra bungalow a month after their marriage. But they still tried to find happiness till her death.\n\nThey remained close and discussed the London visit for her treatment. They had enough contacts to send the Indian doctors’ reports to the doctors in London ASAP. They had enough money to call the doctors in London for their opinion after receiving those reports. It is possible that upon hearing both the Indian and the London doctors’ opinions - that chances of a cure were almost zero without surgery - Kishore was concerned about Madhubala’s ability to take such a long journey and undergo the surgery, perhaps hastening her death, that he’d rather spend as much time with her as possible than take the risk of losing her in flight or worse, in London, in which case, he would have to fly back with the dead body.\n\nBeing the kind of person Kishore was, such prospect terrified him. This does NOT sound like reluctance to help Madhubala or lack of concern. Though Madhubala still felt that an examination in person might make the doctors change their mind about her condition being as hopeless as the x-rays and reports indicated, she kept her thoughts to herself and pretended to agree with Kishore that there was no point in going to London. Privately, behind Kishore, she looked for someone to go with her for that elusive cure she thought awaited her in London.\n\nOnce Kishore got wind of that, he knew this had to be done just for her satisfaction. So he went. After examining Madhubala, the doctors there refused to operate, convinced that her chances of surviving the procedure were minimal, due to her fragile health. Their advice to her was the same as the Indian doctors’ - avoid any kind of stress, strain and anxiety and learn the art of relaxation, rest and avoid overexertion. They predicted that she could live for another year. With the dire knowledge of her imminent death, they returned to India. And Madhubala defied the doctors’ predictions by living another 9 years.\n\nSo while Madhubala was mulling over her London visit, Kishore and Madhubala were not even married. Yet marry they did and Kishore, despite being right about the London visit, endured the painful trip to London for Madhubala’s sake. But Madhubala’s biographer plays the blame game without stating the full truth. Write half the truth – that Kishore was reluctant to go, conveniently omitting the other part. — Send responses to [email protected]"
