        "text": "Kishore Kumar wore many hats over his storied career in Bollywood: actor, producer, lyricist, composer. But what heâs most remembered for is his versatile, richly hued voice, which he lent to some of the most iconic Indian film songs of the 20th century. A self-taught singer, Kumarâs early workâsinging mostly for himself in his acting roles and, intermittently, for Dev Anandâimitated the nasal twang of his idol K. L. Saigal. But over time, he developed a unique, full-throated singing style that incorporated the yodelling of country icons Jimmie Rodgers and Tex Morton. In comparison to his Hindustani classical-indebted peers, Kumarâs voice had a youthful vitality, which he deployed to great effect on songs like âJeevan Ke Safar Mein Raahiâ (1951) and the playful âEk Ladki Bheegi Bhagi Siâ (1958). He had a string of hits in the 1950s and 1960s, but it was his singing on the 1969 super-hit film Aradhanaâwith music composed by S.D. Burman, one of Kumarâs biggest championsâthat catapulted him to Bollywood music royalty. He overtook Mohammed Rafi as the countryâs most popular playback singer, a title he held onto for almost two decades till his death in 1987. Kumar and composer R.D. Burman formed a formidable team, dominating the Indian film music scene with ebullient, jaunty love songs (âYeh Sham Mastaniâ, âYe Jawani Hai Diwaniâ), soulful ballads (âAaj Kahin Na Jaâ, âBahut Door Mujhe Chale Jana Haiâ) and tunes dripping with pathos (âHume Aur Jeene Ki Chahat Na Hotiâ). His voice helped define the careers of many Bollywood superstars, including Dev Anand, Rajesh Khanna, Jeetendra and Amitabh Bachchan. One of Bollywoodâs most endearing mavericksâhe famously butted heads with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the Indian Emergency, leading to a temporary unofficial ban from state radio channelsâKumarâs legacy lives on in the generations of younger singers heâs inspired and the evergreen popularity of his songs."
