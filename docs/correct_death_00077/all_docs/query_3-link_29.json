        "text": "Indian singer (born 1952)\n\nFor other uses, see Amit Kumar (disambiguation).\n\nIn this Bengali name, the surname is Ganguly.\n\nAmit Kumar (born 3 July 1952) is an Indian playback singer, actor, music composer. Kumar launched his own music production company, named Kumar Brothers Music. He predominantly worked in Bollywood and regional film songs since the 1970s, including 150 Hindi and Bengali compositions by R. D. Burman. After Burman's death in 1994, citing a lack of quality music composition, Kumar withdrew from playback singing and concentrated on live orchestra shows. In addition to singing in Hindi, has also performed in Bengali, Bhojpuri, Odia, Assamese, Marathi and Konkani. He is the eldest son of singer-actor Kishore Kumar.[2][1]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nKumar is the son of singer and actor Kishore Kumar[2] and Bengali singer and actress Ruma Guha Thakurta.[3] Like his father, Amit started singing from an early age and he used to sing at Durga Pooja festivals in Calcutta. At one such function arranged by Bengali actor \"Mahanayak\" Uttam Kumar, the audience continued requesting encores. While his mother complained that he was singing \"filmy\" songs, his father decided to bring him to Bombay.\n\nKishore Kumar had cast Amit as his son in two films that he produced. In the first, Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein[4] he sang Aa Chalke Tujhe, Mein Leke Chaloon to his eleven-year-old son. For the second film, Door Ka Raahi, a teenage Amit Kumar sang \"Main Ik Panchi Matwaala Re\", but it was removed from the final cut of the film.\n\nSinging career\n\n[edit]\n\n1970s\n\n[edit]\n\nKumar sang professionally for the first time, outside his father's composition, at the age of 21 in 1973. The song was \"Hosh Mein Hum Kahan\", composed by Sapan Jagmohan for the film Darwaza, which was released in 1978.\n\nHis duet with his father \"Nazar Lage Na Saathiyo\" from Des Pardes in 1978 became popular.[according to whom?] In the 1976 film Balika Badhu, he sang \"Bade Achchhe Lagte Hain\" by the composer R.D. Burman, by which he attained national fame.[5] This song was named the 26th most-popular film song of 1977 by the radio show Binaca Geetmala.[citation needed] Kumar recorded 170 Hindi songs under R.D. Burman.[6]\n\nIn 1978, he sang \"Aati Rahengi Baharein\" in Kasme Vaade, for Randhir Kapoor's character. He also did playback singing for Randhir Kapoor in Chor Ke Ghar Chor (1978) and Dhongee.\n\nHe sang in various films, including Aandhi, Aap Ke Deewane, Khatta Meetha, Gol Maal, Des Pardes, Ganga Ki Saugandh, Deewanagi (1976), Duniya Meri Jeb Mein, Parvarish, Humare Tumhare (1979) and Baton Baton Mein. The duets he sang with Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle began his public display.[according to whom?]\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nKumar's duet \"Ka Janu Main Sajaniya\" with Lata Mangeshkar and \"Ram Kare Allah Kare\" and \"Humto Aap Ke Deewane Hai\" with Mohd Rafi Saab.[according to whom?] Then Amit sang all the songs for the 1981 film Love Story and won a Filmfare Award for the duet \"Yaad Aa Rahi Hai\" with Mangeshkar. Composer R.D. Burman jokingly told Amit before its release that this song sounds like a bhajan.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the success of Love Story, Rajesh Khanna employed Kumar for playback singing in Fiffty Fiffty (1981) and then later in Aakhir Kyon? (1985), Ghar Ka Chirag, Jai Shiv Shankar, Swarg (1990) and Sautela Bhai (1996).\n\nIn 1980, Kumar sang \"Laila o Laila\" for Qurbani.

He became the voice of Kumar Gaurav in the 1980s and their combination gave many hit songs from films such as Romance (1983), Teri Kasam, Lovers (1983), All-rounder and Telefilm-Janam. He was also the voice for newcomer Karan Shah in films such as Jawani, Anokha Rishta, Apne Apne and Chor Pe Mor and though the songs were popular, only Anokha Rishta and Chor Pe Mor were successful films. In the late 1980s, Kumar sang songs for Anil Kapoor in films including Tezaab, Yudh and Aag Se Khelenge and continued to sing for him in the 1990s. The duets with Asha – \"Pehle Pehle Pyar Ki\" and \"Yeh Tujhe Kya Hua\" both from Ilzaam in 1986 and \"Tere Naina Mere Naina\" from Aag Se Khelenge and \"Chotasa Parivaar Hamara\" from Dost in 1989 became known in their respective years.

The song \"Oye Oye- Tirchi Topi Waaley\" from Tridev was a nationwide hit. Kumar did playback for Naseeruddin Shah in the film Hero Hiralal, which was popular as well.[according to whom?] His duet \"Yeh Kismat Hai Kya Kisne Dekha Yahan\" with Alka Yagnik from Ghar Ka Chirag became popular in 1989. Soon after his father's death, Kumar and his half-brother Sumit Kumar released the album Dui Kishore as a tribute to Kishore Kumar.[citation needed]\n\n1990s to present\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, the song \"Sanam Mere Sanam\" of Hum with Alka Yagnik is popular. Baaghi: A Rebel for Love had a smash hit in the song \"Kaisa Lagta Hai\". From the film Ghayal, the song \"Pyaar tum mujhase\" was popular. In this decade, Kumar had notable songs in films such as Sailaab, Police Public, Aaj Ka Arjun, 100 Days, Awwal Number, ChaalBaaz, Khel, Vishwatma, Honeymoon, Aaj Ka Goonda Raaj, Gurudev, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan and Judaai and also had hit songs in the films which flopped at the box office, such as Jawani Zindabad, Afsana Pyar Ka, Indrajeet, Sangdil Sanam, Jaagruti, Deewana Mujhsa Nahin and Suryavanshi.\n\nKumar enjoyed a special work relationship, in addition to R.D. Burman and Bappi Lahiri, with the music duo Anand–Milind, who heavily promoted Kumar in the early 1990s. Their collaborations include Baaghi: A Rebel for Love, Mera Pati Sirf Mera Hain, Maha-Sangram, Swarg, Anjaane Rishtey, Talaashi, Sangdil Sanam, Yaad Rakhegi Duniya, Woh Phir Aayegi, Aaj Ka Goonda Raaj, Sanam, Adharm, and Rakhwala. Anand–Milind were one of the few new-age music composers of that period who regularly recorded with Kumar. Kumar's duets \"Nazrein Milin\" and \"Tip Tip Baarish\" with Asha Bhosle in Afsana Pyar Ka were hit songs.[according to whom?] His duets such as \"Palkon Ke Tale\" and \"Mujhko Yeh Zindagi Lagti Hai\" in Sailaab were hits too.[according to whom?] Kumar gained the reputation of being a singer who belted out hit songs irrespective of the film being a commercial success or critically panned.[according to whom?] Kumar also worked with Ram Laxman and songs such as the Lata-Amit Kumar duets \"Main Jis Din Bhoola Doon\" from Police Public in 1990 and \"Le Le Dil\" from 100 days in 1991 became popular. In 1990, Asha-Amit duets such as \"Aur Suno Kya Haal\" and \"Baj Uthe Gunghroo\" from Chor Pe Mor and Asha-Amit duets such as \"Main Khule Aam Khedun\" and \"Main Na Jhoot\" from Indrajeet in 1991 became popular.

Amit delivered more even in 1993, with Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa. The songs \"Deewana Dil Deewana\" and \"Sachhi Yeh Kahani Hai\" were written.[according to whom?]\n\nKumar also collaborated with another fresh talent from the 1990s, Jatin–Lalit, who had Amit Kumar croon numbers in several films such as Paandav (1995), Silsila Hai Pyar Ka, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.... He even worked with Ilaiyaraaja for the song \"Yeh Gulabi Shaam Ka Nasha\", a duet with Asha from the film Mera Farz (1988). In 1996, his duet with Asha Bhosle in the film Sapoot – \"Kajal Kajal Teri Ankhon Ka\", composed by Anu Malik became popular.\n\nLater in the decade, Kumar declined most singing offers citing that the quality of music was deteriorating since the 1990s and after the death of R.D. Burman in 1994, with whom Amit had a special bond, he withdrew himself from the film industry. Kumar started undertaking more live stage performances in various parts of the world since 1996.\n\nDuring these years, he also composed and released music albums, including:\n\nMAD\n\nPyaar Toh Bas Pyaar Hai\n\nDam Dama Dam\n\nOh sweetheart\n\nSurer raja\n\nSagarika\n\nJaanam\n\nForever Blue\n\nBaba Mere\n\nKumar sang songs for Raju Chacha, Apna Sapna Money Money (2006), Kandahar (2010), Dulha Mil Gaya, Himmatwala (2013).[9]\n\nTelevision career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 1980s, Kumar performed voice work on Doordarshan TV serials such as Chunauti and Campus.
