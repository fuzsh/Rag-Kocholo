Sunday Times walks down memory lane.doweshowbellyad=0; Twenty years after his death, Kishore Kumar still remains everyoneâs favourite (TOI Photo)His unofficial school of clones keeps growing. Remixes are inconceivable without him. He rules on flashback FM programmes. And if the 156 Orkut communities - one of them has over 86,000 members -which swear by his name are a barometer, GenNext too has fallen for him. Almost 20 years since he passed away on October 13, 1987, Kishore Kumar's voice remains as cool as it's contemporary, endearing both the old and the now.\n\nNo surprise, Saregama plans to release a special five-CD set of the singer next month. And another collection of rare duets with the equally effervescent Asha Bhonsle is on the way.\n\nExperts feel the reason behind Kishore's enduring popularity lies in his ability to turn on successive generations.\n\nHe was the first Hindi film playback singer to yodel and the influence is evident even in the forthcoming Sanjay Leela Bhansali flick, Saawariya's brilliant title track.\n\nSinger Babul Supriyo feels that Kishore, like composer RD Burman, encapsulated a flamboyance and flair that was forever young. \"When Kishore Kumar is wooing a girl, it doesn't sound like a prayer or a plea; it has fun and young passion. Other singers may have had divine voices, but Kishoreda's voice was sexy,\" says the singer from the K2 gharana. Lyricist Yogesh says his voice had \"charm\" as well as \"manhood\".\n\nRenowned compere Ameen Sayani sums it up. \"He was perhaps the most versatile singer that the Indian film industry has ever known. He could handle comedy and pathos. And although he never had any formal training, he could delve into classical songs as well,\" says Sayani. Then he adds, \"I have compered almost all great singers on stage. He not only sang and danced and pranced but also did somersaults on stage. But while doing all this, he never went out of tune.\"\n\nSinging was Kishore's primary calling card. But no premier Bollywood artiste has showcased a wider repertoire of extravagant talent: singer, actor, songwriter, composer, dancer, director, producer, prankster, four-time-husband. Yet his career was full of ups and downs. Kishore sang his first Hindi film song in Ziddi (music director: Khemchand Prakash, 1948) but got his first Filmfare award for best male playback only in 1969 for Aradhana.\n\nA great fan of K L Saigal, Khandwa-born Kishore wanted to become a singer. But his elder brother Ashok Kumar wanted him to be an actor because singing wasn't as lucrative. Consequently, the first phase of his career was that of a singer-actor. According to biographer Kishore Valicha, the singer's association with music director S D Burman was a major turning point in his life. During the making of Mashaal (1950), SD paid a visit to Ashok Kumar when he heard someone do a perfect imitation of Saigal. He was told it was Kishore who was singing in the bathroom. The composer complimented him but also said that Kishore needed to develop a style of his own.\n\n\"Burmanda groomed him, helped Kishore find his own voice. He also explored its range and the possibilities it offered,\" says Valicha, author of Kishore Kumar, The Definitive Biography.\n\nGoing through Burman's early compositions chronologically, one can feel the evolution in Kishore's voice. It was through SD, already an integral part of the Navketan camp, that Kishore Kumar began singing for Dev Anand. Kishore's finest numbers in the Fifties and Sixties were primarily filmed on Dev Anand and himself. Songs like Dukhi mann mere (Munimji) established him as a serious singer. The duet Hal kaisa hai janab ka (with Asha, Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi) topped Binaca Geet Mala's annual hit parade in 1959.\n\nBy now, his style was distinct. Composer Pyarelal (Laxmikant's other half) vividly remembers recording their first song with him, Mere mehboob qayamat hogi (Mr X in Bombay, 1964). \"It was a soft and sad number we had done in our own style. But he delivered it the way we wanted,\" he says. Fellow music director Ravindra Jain also recalls his first recording with the singer. \"He asked me to book the studio and came at 9 am. Then he asked me to sing the track. He rehearsed through the day. The recording was perfect.\" The song was Ghungroo ki tarah for Chor Machaye Shor (1974).\n\nBut earlier in the Sixties, Kishore went through a rough patch. In the post-Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958) phase, his films flopped frequently. In 1963, a tiff with Half-Ticket's financier also landed him in income tax trouble. Ashok\n\nKumar had to bail him out. Then on his elder brother's advice, he decided to concentrate on a singing career.\n\nFor much of mid-60s, though, Kishore wallowed in B-grade flops. Opportunities to sing for other actors were rare.\n\nThen Shakti Samanta hooked up with S D Burman for Aradhana (1969). When Kishore was told he would be crooning some of the tracks, he wanted to meet the actor he would be singing for.\n\nAfter Rajesh Khanna arrived at his house, Kishore Kumar asked him a few questions. \"He watched Khanna as he spoke, taking in every gesture. As Khanna was leaving, Kishore told him, âI am going to sing for you. I want you to succeed',\" writes Valicha.\n\nWith Aradhana, Rajesh Khanna became an unstoppable force of nature. So did Kishore, who formed a great box-office team with Bollywood's latest god. Khanna was swept away by the Big B phenomenon in the mid-70s.\n\nKishore's reign continued because he also became the voice of Amitabh Bachchan. Between 1969-87, he captured eight best male playback Filmfare awards.\n\nAt 58, he was too young to die. But going by the reactions he evokes on Orkut, Kishore Kumar's life after death is assured.\n\navijit.ghosh@timesgroup.com\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
