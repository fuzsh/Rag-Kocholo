        "text": "Kishore Kumar (born Abhas Kumar Ganguly; (help·info); 4 August 1929 – 13 October 1987) was an Indian playback singer and actor.[12] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest, most influential and dynamic singers in the history of Indian music.[13][14] He was one of the most popular singers in the Indian subcontinent, notable for his yodeling and ability to sing songs in different voices.[15] He used to sing in different genres but some of his rare compositions, considered classics, were lost in time.[16][17][18] According to his brother and legendary actor Ashok Kumar, Kishore Kumar was successful as a singer because his \"voice hits the mike, straight, at its most sensitive point\".[19]\n\nBesides Hindi, he sang in many other Indian languages, including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam, Odia and Urdu.[20] He also released a few non-film albums in multiple languages, especially in Bengali, which are noted as all-time classics.[21]\n\nHe won 8 Filmfare Awards for Best Male Playback Singer and holds the record for winning the most Filmfare Awards in that category.[21] He was awarded the Lata Mangeshkar Award by the Madhya Pradesh government in 1985."
