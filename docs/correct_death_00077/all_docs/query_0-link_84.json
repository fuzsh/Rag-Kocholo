He will be taking all the decisions (about her last rites),\" Ayan said.\n\nRuma, who is a niece of film director Satyajit Ray, had worked in over 60 films.\n\nMany of her films were made by great directors such as Satyajit Ray, Tapan Sinha, Tarun Majumdar, Rajen Tarafdar, Aparna Sen and Mira Nair.\n\nShe is known for her work in 'Ganga' (1959), 'Abhijaan' (1962), 'Palatak' (1963), 'Antony Firingee' (1967), '80 Te Asio Na' (1967), 'Balika Badhu' (1967), 'Dadar Kirti' (1980), '36 Chowringhee Lane' (1981), 'Amrita Kumbher Sandhane' (1982), 'Bhalobasa Bhalobasa' (1985) and 'Wheelchair' (1994).\n\nRuma also acted in several Hindi films like Jowar Bhata (1944), her first film, Mashaal (1950), Afsar (1950) and Raag Rang (1952). Ruma's last film was Namesake (2006).\n\nShe worked as playback singer in many films.\n\nRuma founded the Calcutta Youth Choir, a song and dance troupe, in 1958, which is known for its performance of folk and mass songs.\n\nPopular songs of Choir included 'Aaj joto juddhabaj', 'Bharatbarsho surjer ek naam', 'O Ganga boichho keno' and 'Waqt ki awaz'.\n\nWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed her grief over the passing away of Ruma and extended her condolences to her family members and innumerable admirers.\n\n\"Saddened at the passing away of Ruma Guha Thakurta. Her contribution to the field of cinema and music will always be remembered.
