        "text": "The only candid interview Kishore Kumar ever agreed to, after some persuasion, was to his life-long singing companion Lata Mangeshkar, who was born in the same year as he was, starting her career around the same time under the same music director, Khemchand Prakash. Here he admits, “When the world has accepted me as someone who is crazy, I find it amusing, why not be a madcap and stay that way for the world?”\n\nKishore Kumar’s favourite rejoinder to those who thought he was nuts remained, “Duniya kahti hai mujhko pagal. Main kahta hoon duniya ko pagal (The world says I’m mad. I say, the world is mad)\".\n\nA month before his death, Kishore Kumar opened his heart about his grief and loneliness to Lata Mangeshkar, who knew him as a friend who “was very sad under the mask.” “He called me to share his sorrow. He didn’t want to come home as there would be too many people there. So, we met at a mutual friend’s place where I saw the other, sombre, side of him. I’ll never forget what he told me about his life that evening. I can’t share that, but I had never imagined he was so unhappy from within,” Lata Mangeshkar revealed in an interview with Subhash K. Jha.\n\nAn Enigma… Gone, Suddenly\n\nIn his autobiography 'Romancing with Life', legendary actor Dev Anand reminisces: “Kishore remained an enigma to me … And finally, one day, without giving any warning, he was gone, suddenly.”\n\nHe fondly remembers the very first song Kishore sang for him in Ziddi (1948), which talked of death and the afterworld: ‘Marne ki duayen kyun mangoon? / Jeene ki tamanna kaun kare? / Yeh duniya ho yaa woh duniya / Ab kwahish-e-duniya kaun kare?’ In Dev Anand’s translation: ‘Why should I wish to die / And who wishes to live? / Whether it’s this world, or whether it’s that / What is left in worlds to desire?’\n\nSimilar thoughts echoed in a more famous SD Burman composition, which Kishore sang for Dev Anand about not living in a world where there’s no peace — that helped him establish himself as a serious singer of reckoning: ‘Dukhi Man Mere, Sun Mera Kahna / Jahan Nahi Chayna, Wahan Nahi Rahena.’ (Funtoosh, 1956)\n\nKishore made his last wish for his long-time buddy, Dev Anand, while recording his last solo for whom he had sung his very first solo almost 40 years ago — ‘Tanha, Main Akela, Toota Tara Koyee’ (Lonely, I’m a solitary fallen star) for Sachche Ka Bol-Bala (1989), which was released two years after his death.\n\nKishore Kumar wanted to retire at the top of his game and on his own accord. “I’ve seen life’s ups and downs. Now I’ve reached a stage from where it’s better to quit because one shouldn’t leave at a time when he is down and out and is removed … Today, by the grace of God, people regard me, and I have a standing. I want to part from this very point,” said Kishore in his last recorded tête-à-tête with Lata.\n\nHe also expressed his urge to go back to his birthplace, Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh: “I miss my home and my hometown very much… I don’t want anything now. I only want to rush back home as soon as possible. It is calling me… ‘Haath uthakar bula raha hai, chal re musafir chal re, apne ghar to chal re!” (Raising its hands, it is calling you; go traveller go, to your own home, go…’)\n\nKishore Kumar told Pritish Nandy in his oft-quoted Illustrated Weekly interview why he wanted to leave Bombay: “Who can live in this stupid, friendless city where everyone seeks to exploit you every moment of the day? Can you trust anyone out here? Is anyone trustworthy? Is anyone a friend you can count on? I am determined to get out of this futile rat race and live as I’ve always wanted to. In my native Khandwa, the land of my forefathers. Who wants to die in this ugly city?”\n\nIn the same vein, poet and writer Javed Akhtar recalls what his favourite singer once told him about why he doesn’t want to die in Bombay: “During a recording session, Kishore Da told me that when I die, let my last rites be done in Khandwa … Here the entire film industry will arrive, and the public will gather around as if it’s a premier of some film.”\n\n“He had this small-town innocence in him and always told us he wanted to go back to Khandwa and become a school master. He always wanted to become one,” recalls his son Amit Kumar in a 1997 interview to Sharmila Taliculam. Amit Kumar also vividly remembers the incident when he saw his father crying while listening to ‘Aa Ab Laut Chalen’ sung by Mukesh in Raj Kapoor’s Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai (1960) “because it reminded him of his village. This was five months before his death. After his death, his body was taken to Khandwa for a last visit.”\n\nHonouring his final wish, Kishore Kumar was cremated in Khandwa. The Madhya Pradesh state government has built a memorial on the outskirts of Khandwa in memory of its most famous son of the soil. As a tribute to his Bengali lineage, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation erected a statue created by sculptor Sunil Pal of Kumartuli in 2000 in a park named after him."
