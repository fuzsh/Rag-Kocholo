        "text": "Bhopal: The buzz over impending sale of ancestral home of legendary singer-actor-director Kishore Kumar in district headquarters town of Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh has left his fans shattered.\n\nReports quoting one Mumbai-based builder Abhay Jain that a deal was made between him and family members of the iconic playback singer of Bollywood last week to sell the century-old bungalow in Bombay Bazar area in Khandwa city at a whopping Rs 14 crore flooded the local dailies in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday.\n\n“The MP government should acquire the real estate and develop it as a heritage site to pay tribute to the legendary singer. Fans of Kishore Kumar are ready to build it a memorial by taking recourse to crowd funding,” Sunil Bamaniya who built a temple for Kishore Kumar in his home in Ujjain, said.\n\nReports said the deal was struck by Mr Jain who too hailed from Khandwa, with the family of Kishore Kumar through for sale of the 7,200 sq ft bungalow.\n\nThe dailies even quoted him as saying that it would take at least one year for registration of the estate since some parts of it were still in dispute.\n\nKishore Kumar and his two brothers, Ashok Kumar and Anup Kumar, had spent their childhood days in the house, famously known in the area as “Gauri Kunj” and “Ganguli House”.\n\nHis father Keylal Ganguly was a renowned lawyer of the city. Kishore Kumar had left for Mumbai to pursue a career in Bollywood after he completed his primary education in Khandwa.\n\nHe however had an emotional attachment to the house and used to visit it frequently. His last rites were performed in Khandwa city after his death in October, 1987, as per his wishes.\n\nGiving a new twist to the buzz, a local newspaper quoted Mumbai-based Arjun Kumar, son of Anup Kumar, as dubbing it a rumour, spread by “some people in Khandwa”."
