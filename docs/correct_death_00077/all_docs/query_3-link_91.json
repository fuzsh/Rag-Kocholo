        "text": "Here is a quick literal translation.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Arup\n\nThe city edition dated 14th October 1987 of the Aajkaal newspaper is\n\nopen in front of me. At the top right of the front page is the news on\n\nthe record 360 runs by West Indies in a one day cricket match and the\n\nnews of Viv Richards scoring a record 360 in this world cup. But I\n\nhave not held on to this newspaper for close to two decades for this\n\nnews. The news in bold letters on the left of the front page is why I\n\nhave held on to this newspaper. You are right - Kishore Kumar Passes\n\nAway | End of the song | Bombay is Sleepless | Calcutta is Silent. If\n\nthe World Cup was not ongoing, it probably would have been the whole\n\nfront page.\n\nThere is nothing new to say about Kishore Kumar or his songs. His\n\nsongs crossed the boundaries of language and made its way to hearts of\n\nthe listeners.\n\nI have read a lot that others have written on reminisced about him.\n\nBut the reminiscing by Kanan Devi, as far as I know, was published in\n\nBartaman (another vernacular daily) only once. During my college days,\n\nreading this, I had realized how the songs of Kishore Kumar touched all\n\nfrom the eight year old to the octogenarians.\n\nI reprint the article from the eighth page of the Bartaman newspaper\n\ndated 16th October 1987.\n\nActress and singer of yester-years, Kanan Devi, deeply saddened by\n\nKishore Kumar's death."
