        "text": "‘Kishore Kumar Bungalow’ reads the name plate outside the mansion. Inside, the aroma of fish being tossed in spices fills the air from room to room. The 60 plus Amit Kumar is now the man of the house, which homes both his mothers, erstwhile actors Ruma Guha Thakurta and stepmom Leena Chandavarkar and her 29-year-old son Sumeet along with Amit’s wife Reema Ganguly and daughter Muktika.\n\nMore than two decades have rolled past since the demise of his celebrated father Kishore Kumar but he keeps discovering newer facets about the actor-singer. “My fan club in Kolkata keeps sending me DVDs of dad’s rare films. They’ll also be sending me Dhobi Doctor (with Asha Parekh), Ruxana (with Meena Kumari) and Chandan (with Nutan). More than the popular Sapnon ki rani and Roop tera mastana (both in Aradhana), I enjoy his old songs like Anil Biswas’ Husn bhi hai udaas udaas (Fareb). He was full of romance,” says he of the legendary singer whose songs became the love syllabi for an entire nation.\n\nAmit asks, “Where can you find an artiste who was a producer, director, writer, lyricist, composer, singer and actor all rolled into one? Dad ruled as the number one singer for 19 years.” Amit says he often senses his father’s ‘soul’ in the house. “According to the scriptures this is the month of Pitra Paksha during which your late ancestors visit you. Just two days ago, I was resting in the afternoon, when I felt someone touch my feet, I felt an inexplicable warmth in the touch,” says Amit of the presence that is inextricable in his life and mind.\n\nCAMERA-HAPPY\n\nFew would know that the late singer Kishore Kumar’s first love was filmmaking. In fact, he had an 8mm camera with which he kept filming day to day moments. “He shot my growing years and made two volumes – Amit 1 and Amit 2 out of them,” recalls Amit who still cherishes the time they went to Darjeeling where Kishore was shooting for Madhbare Nain with Bina Rai. “He shot our entire train journey from Darjeeling to Kolkata. He even met Sherpa Tensing (first person to set foot on Mount Everest) there. Dad also loved shooting his parents in Khandwa (the Gangulys’ hometown in Madhya Pradesh). But unfortunately we lost the camera,” he laments.\n\nHOLLYWOOD BUFF\n\nAnother obsession the singer had was for Hollywood movies. “He had a fantastic collection of James Bond, Alfred Hitchcock films and Hollywood classics. On my birthdays, he’d treat me to Hollywood films. He’d hire movies of the ’40s-’70s and see them with the help of his 16 mm projector at home,” shares Amit. He narrates an interesting incident, “Once in the early ’80s, dad, Leenaji (stepmother) and Sumeet (step brother), who was just six-months-old and I had been to the USA. Dad told us to go and watch a film, while he’d spend his time at a video shack. He got so besotted with the huge collection of Hollywood movies there that he kept buying and buying. Finally, the owner took him to the warehouse for some more rare stuff. In all, he bought VCDs worth 8000 dollars. The owner had understood his identity by then,” narrates Amit. “Just then Eddie Murphy (noted musician and film personality) came along. The shack owner introduced dad to him as the ‘Frank Sinatra of India’. Dad, knowing that I was a great Eddie Murphy fan, asked him for an autograph. Dad also told him that I was hot-tempered. So Murphy wrote, ‘Cool it Amit’ and signed below,” he smiles. Few years later, when Kishore passed away the video-shack owner came to know of it and called Amit to say, “Your dad will remain special not because he was my biggest customer but because he was a great artiste.”\n\nComing back to Kishore’s passion for foreign classics, he says, “He never lent them. How Green Was My Valley and The Grapes Of Wrath were his all-time favourites. Gary Cooper was his favourite actor and Marlon Brando his idol. In fact, arrangements were made for dad to meet Brando. But that year dad passed away.”\n\nMETHOD IN MADNESS\n\nTales about Kishore’s endearing eccentricities abounded during his lifetime. Like outside his house was written, ‘This is a lunatic asylum’. Like once he put make-up on half his face for a producer who had only paid him half his fee. Amit doesn’t deny these but explains, “He had seen artistes struggle. It had taken him 25 years to become Kishore Kumar. In the industry no one pays you on time. So, he did the right thing.” He adds, “To the world he was a mystery. But he had a naqab on. He was not mad. Woh uska mazaa lete the (he used to enjoy his act). The media wrote nasty things, but he never cared. He ruled in hell.”\n\nAmit goes on to share some Kishoresque anecdotes. “In 1972, he started growing his hair and sporting sadhu-like orange robes with a mala around his neck. He even went for recordings with these. When asked why he was dressed like that he’d answer ‘meri marzi’. He began calling himself Swami Kishore Anand. Later, he blindfolded himself. ‘Mujhe kisiko nahin dekhna. Looking at each other invokes jealousy’, was his logic. For days, he went around like this. Then one day he took off to Badrinath wearing those robes. After the darshan he sat on a peak. Some women asked who the sadhu was. His associate Robin Kumar said he was Swami Kishore Anand. They went up to touch his feet. But one of them recognised him and screamed, ‘Yeh to Kishore Kumar hai’,” laughs Amit. “I never saw my father ever going to a barber. He trimmed his own hair by placing three mirrors.” Amit rubbishes the notion that his dad was a miser. “If someone from the staff came to him he’d pull out a bunch of notes and give. He did a lot of charity and free shows for jawans and cancer patients but he never spoke about it.”\n\nHOME SWEET HOME\n\nKIshore was a homebody and avoided the trappings of stardom. “Dada Moni (Kishore’s brother Ashok Kumar) was a superstar and threw parties at his Worli residence while dad was a beginner. It was attended by the who’s who. So dad, who didn’t drink, would go to the Haji Ali parapet and sleep there till the wee hours.” He adds, “He was not hot-tempered but strict. When he returned home, the buzz would go around, ‘Sahab ghar aagaye’. He was an early riser and went to bed early. He loved authentic Bengali food like puri tarkari, aloo gobi, mutton curry, katla macher and hilsa curry.”\n\nEMOTIONAL ATYACHAAR\n\nAmit says his father was deeply emotional, a side he seldom expressed. “He’d show his thumb and say, “See it’s so stiff. Main jhukta nahin (I don’t give in easily).” But there were occasions when he let the mask slip. “Once he was recording the Bangla song Ei to jobon written by noted poet Gauri Prasan Majumdar. It said that all violence, jealousy and hostility come to naught on the funeral pyre. He was so moved by the thought that he refused to take remuneration for the song.” Kishore enjoyed listening to the radio and would get excited when his songs played more often than those of other singers. “He’d say, ‘Mera gaana zyada baja’ like a child. But one day he happened to hear Mukeshji’s song Aa ab laut chalein (Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai). He began sobbing like a baby and said that he wanted to return to Khandwa. He was basically a villager at heart,” says the son.\n\nDOOR-DARSHAN\n\nAmit reveals his dad was also philosophic. “That’s why he was fascinated with the word ‘door’ and used it in his trilogy films Door Gagan Ki Chaon Mein, Door Ka Rahi and Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin. The films were the mirror of his heart. Though he was a fine comedian he was fascinated by serious subjects.” In fact, Kishore was contemplating making films - Dinoo Ka Dinanath – about a shepherd boy with the healing touch and Drihstiheen about blind survivors in a pilgrim bus mishap. “He believed in Christ and was fond of Biblical films. He liked sitting in a cemetery. Once he was sitting in a cemetery in Goa, when he saw a name plate on a padre’s grave reading ‘Died on August 4 1929 (the day dad was born)’. From that day onwards he called himself Father Brown saying, ‘I was a padre in my previous life’.”\n\nMY FATHER’S WIVES\n\nAmit says that he shared a pleasant rapport with all his dad’s wives from Madhubala to Leena Chandavarkar. “Dad wanted to be the breadwinner and let his woman be just the wife. But he married all artistes, that’s why he failed. But he finally found love,” he says referring to Kishore’s fourth wife and actor Leena Chandavarkar. Where his mother and Kishore’s first wife and actor Ruma Devi is concerned he says, “My mother met dad in Bombay Talkies. Dad was recording the song Marne ki duaaen kyun maangoon for Dev Anand’s Ziddi.”\n\nAmit has vivid recollections of Kishore’s second wife, actor Madhubala. “I first saw Madhubala when I was around 10. She had returned from shooting when dad said, ‘Namaste karo’. Later my father and she moved into a rented a flat near Ottter’s Club in Bandra. This was after their London visit to seek medical advice for her feeble heart condition. I’d stay with them there during the vacation. I even slept between them. I’ve this habit of kicking in my sleep. Once I heard her saying, ‘Tumhara beta bahut laath marta hai’,” laughs Amit. “Yes, she was slowly deteriorating. When I had seen her on the set of Jhumroo, she looked beautiful. But later she started looking frail.” He adds, “I shared a good rapport even with Yogeeta Bali (Kishore’s ex-wife).”\n\nMY FATHER’S VOICE\n\n“Undeniably, my father was my hero. Today people recognise me because of him. He was the one who showed me how to hold the microphone,” says an emotional Amit. “I used to attend his recording sessions where he had a special chair reserved with his name on it. He’d turn around, look at me and say, ‘One day you’ll also sing’.” Amit, who topped the charts with Love Story (1981) says, “RD Burman was the first composer who showed trust in me. but Panchamda was not happy with the score he had composed for Love Story. He called it bakwas. But the songs became a hit. Then someone wrote that I was a ‘besura’ singer. I began crying. Dad consoled me saying, ‘Kuch toh log kahenge’.”\n\nAmit, whose hits include the ever popular Bade achche lagte hain (Balika Badhu), Teri yaad aa rahi hai (Love Story) and Deewana dil deewana (Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa) says, “I’m not in the rat race. I’ve never considered myself a great singer. But I never tried to copy my father. Even if you’re son of the Prince of Persia, you’ve got to have something to survive. On stage, I always joke, ‘When you’ve accepted the bray of a donkey why not Amit Kumar’s voice?’” he laughs.\n\nComing back to his legendary father, Amit recalls the 13th evening of October 1987, when Kishore Kumar passed away at 58. “I was in Toronto and was supposed to reach home by October 16. I had got all the VCDs he had asked for. Back home dad was shifting furniture. He loved changing the ‘ghar ka naqsha’. He’d say, ‘Rabindranath Tagore also did that’. Just then he complained of pain and lay down on the bed. Leenaji gave him his pill. She wanted to call the doctor when he joked, ‘Doctor ko mat bulana warna heart attack aajayega’! He never spoke after that.”\n\nThe world remembers him as one of the best singers in Hindi cinema, but truth be told, Kishore Kumar was also one hell of an actor. His comic timing was legendary and those who succeeded him in films, have only managed to ape what Kishore Kumar made savvy back in his days."
