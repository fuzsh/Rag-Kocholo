        "text": "A file picture of brothers Sumeet Kumar and Amit Kumar shot against a picture of their late father and legendary singer Kishore Kumar\n\n‘Kishore Kumar Bungalow’ reads the name plate outside the suburban mansion. Inside, the aroma of fish being tossed in spices floats from room to room. The 59-year-old Amit Kumar is now the man of the house, which houses both his mothers, erstwhile actors Ruma Guha Thakurta and stepmom Leena Chandavarkar, along with her 29-year-old son Sumeet and Amit’s wife Reema Ganguly and their daughter Muktika.\n\nMore than two decades have rolled past since the demise of his celebrated father Kishore Kumar but Amit keeps discovering new facets about him. He asks, “Where can you find an artiste who was a producer, director, writer, lyricist, composer, singer and actor all rolled into one? Dad ruled as the number one singer for 19 years.” He adds, “My fan club in Kolkata keeps sending me DVDs of dad’s rare films. They’ll also send Dhobi Doctor (with Asha Parekh), Ruxana (with Meena Kumari) and Chandan (with Nutan). More than the popular songs Mere sapnon ki rani and Roop tera mastana (both in Aradhana), I enjoy dad’s old songs like Anil Biswas’ Husn bhi hai udaas udaas (Fareb). He was full of romance,” says Amit of the legendary singer whose songs became the love syllabi for the nation.\n\nCamera-happy\n\nFew would know that the late singer’s first love was filmmaking. He had an 8 mm camera with which he kept filming day to day moments. “He shot my growing years and made two volumes — Amit 1 and Amit 2 out of them,” recalls Amit who still cherishes the time they went to Darjeeling where Kishore was shooting for Madhbare Nain with Bina Rai. “He shot our entire train journey from Darjeeling to Kolkata with the camera. He even met Sherpa Tensing (first person to set foot on Mount Everest) there. Dad also loved shooting his parents in Khandwa (the Gangulys’ hometown in Madhya Pradesh). But unfortunately we lost the camera,” he laments.\n\nHollywood buff\n\nAnother obsession the singer had was for Hollywood movies. “Dad had a fantastic collection of James Bond, Alfred Hitchcock films and other Hollywood classics. On my birthdays, he’d treat me to these films. We’d watch them with the help of his 16 mm projector at home,” shares Amit. He narrates an interesting incident, “Once during the early ’80s, dad, Leenaji (stepmother), Sumeet (step brother) and I had been to the USA. Dad told us to go and watch a film, while he’d spend his time at a video shack. He got so besotted with the huge collection of Hollywood movies there that he kept on buying. Finally, he went to to the warehouse to pick some more rare stuff. In all, he bought VCDs worth $ 8000. The owner had recognised him,” narrates Amit. “Just then Eddie Murphy (noted musician and film personality) came along. The owner introduced dad to him as the ‘Frank Sinatra of India’. Dad, knowing that I was a great Eddie Murphy fan, asked him for an autograph. Dad also told him that I was hot-tempered. So Murphy wrote, ‘Cool it Amit’ and signed below,” he smiles. Few years later, when Kishore passed away the shack owner called Amit to say, “Your dad’ll remain special not because he was my biggest customer but because he was a great artiste.”\n\nComing back to Kishore’s passion for foreign classics, Amit says, “How Green Was My Valley and The Grapes Of Wrath were his all-time favourites. Gary Cooper was his favourite actor and Marlon Brando his idol. In fact, arrangements were made for dad to meet Brando. But that year dad passed away.”\n\nMethod in madness\n\nTales about Kishore’s endearing eccentricities abounded during his lifetime. Like outside his house was written, ‘This is a lunatic asylum’. Like once he put make-up on half his face for a producer who had only paid him half his fee. Amit doesn’t deny these but explains, “He had seen artistes struggle. It had taken him 25 years to become Kishore Kumar. Here, no one pays you on time. So, he did the right thing.” He adds, “To the world he was a mystery. But he had a naqab on. He was not mad. Woh uska mazaa lete the (he used to enjoy his act). He’d say, ‘Duniya mujhe kehti pagal, main kehta duniya ko pagal’. The media wrote nasty things, but he never cared.”\n\nAmit goes on to share some Kishoresque anecdotes. “In 1972, he started growing his hair and sporting sadhu-like orange robes with a mala around his neck. He even went for recordings like that. He began calling himself Swami Kishore Anand. Later, he blindfolded himself. ‘Mujhe kisiko nahin dekhna. Looking at each other invokes jealousy’, was his logic. For days, he went around like this. Then one day he took off to Badrinath wearing those robes. After the darshan, he sat on a peak. Some women asked who the sadhu was. His associate Robin Kumar said he was Swami Kishore Anand. They went up to touch his feet. But one of them recognised him and screamed, ‘Yeh to Kishore Kumar hai’,” laughs Amit. “I never saw my father ever going to a barber. He trimmed his own hair by placing three mirrors around him.” Amit rubbishes the allegation that his dad was a miser. “If someone from the staff came to him he’d pull out a bunch of notes and hand them over. He did a lot of charity and also free shows for jawans and cancer patients but he never spoke about it.”\n\nHome sweet home\n\nKishore was basically simple and unaffected by the trappings of stardom. “Dada Moni (Kishore’s eldest brother Ashok Kumar) was a superstar and threw parties at his Worli residence while dad was a beginner. It was attended by the who’s who. So dad, who didn’t drink, would go to the Haji Ali parapet and sleep there till the wee hours.” He adds, “He was an early riser. He loved authentic Bengali food like puri tarkari, aloo gobi, mutton curry, katla macher jhol and Hilsa curry.”\n\nEmotional atyachaar\n\nAmit says his father was deeply emotional, a side he seldom expressed. “He’d show his thumb and say, “See it’s so stiff. Main jhukta nahin (I don’t give in easily).” But there were occasions when he let the mask slip. “Once, he was recording the Bangla song Ei to jobon written by noted poet Gauri Prasan Majumdar. It said that all violence, jealousy and hostility come to naught on the funeral pyre. He was so moved by the thought that he refused to take remuneration for the song.” Kishore enjoyed listening to the radio and would get excited when his songs played more often than those of other singers. “He’d say, ‘Mera gaana zyada baja’ like a child. But one day he happened to hear Mukeshji’s song Aa ab laut chalein (Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai). He began sobbing like a baby and said that he wanted to return to Khandwa. He was basically a villager at heart,’’ says the son.\n\nDoor-darshan\n\nAmit reveals his dad was also philosophic. “That’s why he was fascinated with the word ‘door’ and used it in his trilogy Door Gagan Ki Chaon Mein, Door Ka Rahi and Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin. The films were the mirror of his heart. He was a fine comedian but was fascinated by serious subjects.” In fact, Kishore was contemplating making films — Dinoo Ka Dinanath, a film about a shepherd boy with the healing touch, and Drihstiheen, about blind survivors in a pilgrim bus mishap. “He believed in Christ and was fond of Biblical films. He liked sitting in a cemetery. Once he was sitting in a cemetery in Goa, when he saw a name plate on a padre’s grave, which read ‘Died on August 4 1929 (the day dad was born)’. From that day onwards he called himself Father Brown saying, ‘I was a padre in my previous life’.”\n\nMy father’s wives\n\nAmit says that he shared a pleasant rapport with all his dad’s wives from Madhubala to Leena Chandavarkar. “Dad wanted to be the breadwinner and let his woman be just the wife. But he married all artistes, that’s why he failed. But he finally found love in Leenaji,” he says referring to Kishore’s fourth wife. Where his mother and Kishore’s first wife and actor Ruma Devi is concerned he says, “My mom met dad in Bombay Talkies where he was recording the song Marne ki duaaen kyun maangoon for Dev Anand’s Ziddi.”\n\nAmit has vivid recollections of Kishore’s second wife, actor Madhubala. “I first saw Madhubala when I was around 10. She had returned from shooting when dad said, ‘Namaste karo’. Later my father and she moved into a rented flat near Ottter’s Club in Bandra. This was after their London visit to seek medical advice for her heart condition. I’d stay with them during the vacation. I even slept between them. I’ve this habit of kicking in my sleep. Once I heard her saying, ‘Tumhara beta bahut laath marta hai’,” laughs Amit. “She was slowly deteriorating. When I had seen her on the set of Jhumroo, she looked beautiful. But later she started looking frail.” He adds, “I shared a good rapport even with Yogeeta Bali (Kishore’s ex-wife, now married to actor Mithun Chakraborty).”\n\nMy father’s voice\n\n“Of course, my father was my hero. Today people recognise me because of him,” says an emotional Amit. “I used to attend his recording sessions where he had a special chair reserved with his name on it. He’d turn around, look at me and say, ‘One day you’ll also sing’.”\n\nAmit, who topped the charts with Love Story (1981) says, “RD Burman was the first composer to trust me. But Panchamda was not happy with the Love Story score. He called it bakwas. But the songs became a hit. Then someone wrote that I was a ‘besura’ singer. I began crying. Dad consoled me saying, ‘Kuch toh log kahenge’.”\n\nAmit, whose ever popular songs include Bade achche lagte hain (Balika Badhu), Teri yaad aa rahi hai (Love Story) and Deewana dil deewana (Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa) says, “I’m not in the rat race. I’ve never considered myself a great singer nor have I ever tried to copy my father. Even if you’re the son of Prince of Persia, you’ve got to have something in you to survive. On stage, I always joke, ‘When you’ve accepted the bray of a donkey why not Amit Kumar’s voice?’”\n\nComing back to his legendary father, Amit recalls the evening of October 13, 1987, when Kishore Kumar passed away. “I was in Toronto and was supposed to reach home by October 16. I had got all the VCDs he had asked for. Back home dad was shifting furniture. He loved changing the ‘ghar ka naqsha’. He’d say, ‘Rabindranath Tagore also did that’. Just then he complained of pain and lay down on the bed. Leenaji gave him his pill. She was about to call the doctor when he said in jest, ‘Doctor ko mat bulana warna heart attack aajayega’! He never spoke after that.”\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
