Mumbai– From Lata Mangeshkar to Amitabh Bachchan to Rishi Kapoor — Indian film fraternity members on Thursday remembered legendary singer-actor Kishore Kumar on his 87th birth anniversary, calling him a “phenomenal star” who continues to rule people’s hearts.

Kishore Kumar, fondly known as Kishore-da, gave the Indian film industry songs like “Kabhi alvida na kehna”, “Zindagi ka safar …”, “Aa chal ke tujhe”, “Pal pal dil ke paas”, “Hawa ke saath saath”, “Chhookar mere mann ka” and “Jahaan teri ye nazar hai”.
