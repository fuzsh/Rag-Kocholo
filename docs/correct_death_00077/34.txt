Kishore Kumar spent his formative years in the house.

Highlights

The two-storey 'Ganguly House' in Khandwa district has seen better days but the haveli, which was once the home of singer Kishore Kumar, is lying in a dilapidated condition now.

Kishore Kumar, who was very proud of his Khandwa connection, spent his formative years in the house, situated in the Bombay Bazaar area, with his actor brothers Ashok Kumar and Anoop Kumar.

Kishore Prerna Manch, an organisation set up by the local people and fans of the legendary singer, has been trying for many years to get the house converted into a memorial but their efforts have not borne fruit so far.

Manch coordinator Ranveer Chawla said they have given a memorandum to state culture minister Laxmikant Sharma requesting that the government acquire the property in public interest and convert it into a memorial.

While Kishore Kumar's son Amit Kumar could not be contacted over the issue, Amit Kumar's secretary Prakash said that he had handed over the property to Anoop Kumar's son Arjun Kumar and now only he can take a decision on the issue.

Prakash said, "As far as Kishore Kumar's immediate family members, including his son Amit and wife Leena Chandavarkar, are concerned, they have no problem with the place being converted into a memorial."

The city has Kishore Kumar's Samadhi, where his last rites were performed as per his wishes. The place has a theatre with a facility to hear and watch songs of Kishore.

Besides, the city also has an auditorium Gouri-Kunj, named after his parents.

Kishore Kumar's childhood friend Manak Chand Chouhan, who studied with him till high school said, "Not just me but the entire people of Khandwa and his fans world over wanted this place to be converted into a memorial."
