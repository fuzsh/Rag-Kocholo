        "text": "Pesticidal compositions comprising a triazole compound\n\nDescription\n\nThe present invention relates to pesticidal compositions and uses and methods for combatting harmful pests using the inventive compositions, such as phythopathogenic fungi and/or for the control of insects, acarids or nematodes. Furthermore, the present invention provides methods for improving the health of a plant using the inventive compositions.\n\nWith a view to reducing the application rates and broadening the activity spectrum of known compounds, it was an object of the present invention to provide compositions which, at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied, show improved activity against important harmful fungi, in particular for certain indications. It was a further object to provide for compositions that are useful for the control of specific pathogens in specific important crops that are often susceptible to the attack of pathogens.\n\nOne typical problem arising in the field of pest control lies in the need to reduce the dosage rates of the active ingredient in order to reduce or avoid unfavorable environmental or toxicological effects whilst still allowing effective pest control.\n\nAnother problem encountered concerns the need to have available pest control agents which are effective against a broad spectrum of pests. There also exists the need for pest control agents that combine knock-down activity with prolonged control, that is, fast action with long lasting action.\n\nAnother difficulty in relation to the use of pesticides is that the repeated and exclusive application of an individual pesticidal compound leads in many cases to a rapid selection of pests which have developed natural or adapted resistance against the active compound in question. Therefore there is a need for pest control agents that help prevent or overcome resistance induced by pesticides.\n\nFurthermore, there is a desire for pesticide compounds or combination of compounds, which when applied improve plants, which may result in \"plant health \", \"vitality of plant propagation material\" or \"increased plant yield\".\n\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide agricultural combinations which solves one or more than one of the discussed problems. It has been found that this object is in part or in whole achieved by the combination of active compounds defined below.\n\nAccording to the first aspect, the present invention relates to pesticidal compositions comprising,\n\n1 ) as component I a compound selected from the group consisting of the compounds 1-1 , I-2, I- 3, I-4, I-5, I-6, I-7, I-8, I-9, 1-10, 1-1 1 , 1-12, 1-13, 1-14, 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-18, 1-19, I -20, 1-21 , I-22, I- 23, I -24, I-25, I-26, I-27, I-28, I-29, I-30 and 1-31 , or the N-oxides or the agriculturally acceptable salts of each of the compounds;

The invention furthermore also relates to seed comprising the compositions. The invention furthermore also relates to methods for controlling phytopathogenic fungi as detailled herein, wherein the fungi or the materials, plants, the soil or seed to be protected from fungal attack are treated with an effective amount of a compositions according to the invention. The invention furthermore also relates to processes for preparing the compositions according to the invention.\n\nThe compositions may be used by treating the fungi or the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms to be protected from fungal attack with a fungicidally effective amount of the active substances. The application can be carried out both before and after the infection of the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms by the fungi.\n\nBy applying the components of the inventive composition or the composition, respectively, a synergistic effect can be obtained, i.e. more then simple addition of the individual effects is obtained (synergistic mixtures).\n\nThis can be obtained by applying the components simultaneously, either jointly (e. g. as tank- mix) or seperately, or in succession, wherein the time interval between the individual applications is selected to ensure that the active substance applied first still occurs at the site of action in a sufficient amount at the time of application of the further active substance(s). The order of application is not essential for working of the present invention.\n\nWhen applying the components sequentially the time between both applications may vary e. g. between 2 hours to 7 days. Also a broader range is possible ranging from 0.25 hour to 30 days, preferably from 0.5 hour to 14 days, particularly from 1 hour to 7 days or from 1 .5 hours to 5 days, even more preferred from 2 hours to 1 day.\n\nThe compositions according to the invention may effectively be used against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, including soil-borne fungi, which derive especially from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes), Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes (syn. Fungi imperfecti). Some are systemically effective and they can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, fungicides for seed dressing and soil fungicides. Moreover, they are suitable for controlling harmful fungi, which inter alia occur in wood or roots of plants.\n\nThe compositions according to the invention are particularly important in the control of a multitude of phytopathogenic fungi on various cultivated plants, such as cereals, e. g. wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oats or rice; beet, e. g. sugar beet or fodder beet; fruits, such as pomes, stone fruits or soft fruits, e. g. apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries,\n\nstrawberries, raspberries, blackberries or gooseberries; leguminous plants, such as lentils, peas, alfalfa or soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cocoa beans, castor oil plants, oil palms, ground nuts or soybeans; cucurbits, such as squashes, cucumber or melons; fiber plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits or paprika; lauraceous plants, such as avocados, cinnamon or camphor; energy and raw material plants, such as corn, soybean, rape, sugar cane or oil palm; corn: tobacco; nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; vines (table grapes and grape juice grape vines); hop; turf; sweet leaf (also called Stevia); natural rubber plants or ornamental and forestry plants, such as flowers, shrubs, broad-leaved trees or evergreens, e. g. conifers; and on the plant propagation material, such as seeds, and the crop material of these plants.\n\nPreferably, the compositions are used for controlling a multitude of fungi on field crops, such as potatoes sugar beets, tobacco, wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, rape, legumes, sunflowers, coffee or sugar cane; fruits; vines; ornamentals; or vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, beans or squashes.\n\nThe term \"plant propagation material\" is to be understood to denote all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (e. g. potatoes), which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots, sprouts and other parts of plants, including seedlings and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil. These young plants may also be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or pouring.\n\nPreferably, treatment of plant propagation materials with the inventive compositions or the components thereof, respectively, is used for controlling a multitude of fungi on cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and oats; rice, corn, cotton and soybeans.\n\nThe term \"cultivated plants\" is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development (cf. http://cera-gmc.org/, see GM crop database therein). Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-translational modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e. g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.\n\nPlants that have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering, e. g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides, such as auxin herbicides such as dicamba or 2,4-D; bleacher herbicides such as hydroxylphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors or phytoene desaturase (PDS) inhibitors; acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas or imidazolinones; enolpyruvylshikimate-3- phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibitors, such as glyphosate; glutamine synthetase (GS) inhibitors such as glufosinate; protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors; lipid biosynthesis inhibitors such as acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors; or oxynil (i. e. bromoxynil or ioxynil) herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Furthermore, plants have been made resistant to multiple classes of herbicides through multiple genetic modifications, such as resistance to both glyphosate and glufosinate or to both glyphosate and a herbicide from another class such as ALS inhibitors, HPPD inhibitors, auxin herbicides, or ACCase inhibitors. These herbicide resistance technologies are e. g. described in Pest Managem. Sci. 61 , 2005, 246; 61 , 2005, 258; 61 , 2005, 277; 61 , 2005, 269; 61 , 2005, 286; 64, 2008, 326; 64, 2008, 332; Weed Sci. 57, 2009, 108; Austral. J. Agricult. Res. 58, 2007, 708; Science 316, 2007, 1185; and references quoted therein. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis), e. g. ClearfieldÂ® summer rape (Canola, BASF SE, Germany) being tolerant to imidazolinones, e. g. imazamox, or ExpressSunÂ® sunflowers (DuPont, USA) being tolerant to sulfonyl ureas, e. g. tribenuron. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants such as soybean, cotton, corn, beets and rape, tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate, some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReadyÂ® (glyphosate-tolerant, Monsanto, U.S.A.),\n\nCultivanceÂ® (imidazolinone tolerant, BASF SE, Germany) and LibertyLinkÂ® (glufosinate- tolerant, Bayer CropScience, Germany).\n\nFurthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins, especially those known from the bacterial genus Bacillus, particularly from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as Î´-endotoxins, e. g. CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CrylF(a2), CryllA(b), CrylllA, CrylllB(bl) or Cry9c; vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e. g. VIP1 , VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes, e. g. Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp.; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins, or other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea or barley lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsin inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin or papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3- hydroxysteroid oxidase, ecdysteroid-IDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors or HMG-CoA-reductase; ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels; juvenile hormone esterase; diuretic hormone receptors (helicokinin receptors); stilbene synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases or glucanases. In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood expressly also as pre-toxins, hybrid proteins, truncated or otherwise modified proteins.\n\nHybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains, (see, e. g.\n\nWO 02/015701 ). Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capable of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed, e. g., in EP-A 374 753, WO 93/007278,\n\nWO 95/34656, EP-A 427 529, EP-A 451 878, WO 03/18810 und WO 03/52073. The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e. g. in the publications mentioned above. These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the plants producing these proteins tolerance to harmful pests from all taxonomic groups of arthropods, especially to beetles (Coeloptera), two-winged insects (Diptera), and moths (Lepidoptera) and to nematodes (Nematoda). Genetically modified plants capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins are, e. g., described in the publications mentioned above, and some of which are commercially available such as YieldGardÂ® (corn cultivars producing the Cry1 Ab toxin), YieldGardÂ® Plus (corn cultivars producing Cry1 Ab and Cry3Bb1 toxins), StarlinkÂ® (corn cultivars producing the Cry9c toxin), HerculexÂ® RW (corn cultivars producing Cry34Ab1 , Cry35Ab1 and the enzyme phosphinothricin-N-acetyltransferase [PAT]);\n\nNuCOTNÂ® 33B (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1 Ac toxin), BollgardÂ® I (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1 Ac toxin), BollgardÂ® II (cotton cultivars producing Cry1 Ac and Cry2Ab2 toxins); VIPCOTÂ® (cotton cultivars producing a VIP-toxin); NewLeafÂ® (potato cultivars producing the Cry3A toxin); Bt-XtraÂ®, NatureGardÂ®, KnockOufÂ®, BiteGardÂ®, ProtectaÂ®, Bt1 1 (e. g.

Examples of such proteins are the so-called \"pathogenesis-related proteins\" (PR proteins, see, e. g. EP-A 392 225), plant disease resistance genes (e. g. potato cultivars, which express resistance genes acting against Phytophthora infestans derived from the Mexican wild potato Solarium bulbocastanum) or T4-lysozym (e. g. potato cultivars capable of synthesizing these proteins with increased resistance against bacteria such as Erwinia amylvora). The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e. g. in the publications mentioned above.\n\nFurthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the productivity (e. g. bio mass production, grain yield, starch content, oil content or protein content), tolerance to drought, salinity or other growth-limiting environmental factors or tolerance to pests and fungal, bacterial or viral pathogens of those plants.\n\nFurthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve human or animal nutrition, e. g. oil crops that produce health-promoting long-chain omega-3 fatty acids or unsaturated omega-9 fatty acids (e. g. NexeraÂ® rape, DOW Agro Sciences, Canada).\n\nFurthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content, specifically to improve raw material production, e. g. potatoes that produce increased amounts of amylopectin (e. g. Amf!oraÂ® potato, BASF SE, Germany).\n\nThe compositions are particularly suitable for controlling the following plant diseases:\n\nAlbugo spp. (white rust) on ornamentals, vegetables (e. g. A.

As to the protection of wood and other materials, the particular attention is paid to the following harmful fungi: Ascomycetes such as Ophiostoma spp., Ceratocystis spp. , Aureobasidium pullulans, Sclerophoma spp. , Chaetomium spp. , Humicola spp., Petriella spp., Trichurus spp.;\n\nBasidiomycetes such as Coniophora spp., Coriolus spp., Gloeophyllum spp., Lentinus spp., Pleurotus spp., Poria spp., Serpula spp. and Tyromyces spp., Deuteromycetes such as\n\nAspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp. , Penicilli urn spp., Trichodenma spp. , Alternaria spp. , Paecilomyces spp. and Zygomycetes such as Mucor spp., and in addition in the protection of stored products and harvest the following yeast fungi are worthy of note: Candida spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisae.\n\nBacteria pathogenic for plants are responsible for devastating losses in agriculture. The use of antibiotics to control such infections is restricted in many countries due to worries over the evolution and transmission of antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe compositions according to the invention may also be suitable as bactericides. They may be distinguished by an outstanding effectiveness against a broad spectrum of\n\nphytopathogenic bacteria, including soil-borne bacteria, which derive especially from the genera of Agrobacterium, Clavibacter, Corynebacterium, Erwinia, Leifsonia, Pectobacterium, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Xanthomonas (e. g. Xanthomonas oryzae causing bacterial blight on rice) and Xylella; preferably Erwinia; even more preferably Erwinia amylovora causing fire blight on apples, pears and other member of the family Rosaceae.\n\nThe method of treatment according to the invention can also be used in the field of protecting stored products or harvest against attack of fungi and microorganisms. According to the present invention, the term \"stored products\" is understood to denote natural substances of plant or animal origin and their processed forms, which have been taken from the natural life cycle and for which long-term protection is desired. Stored products of crop plant origin, such as plants or parts thereof, for example stalks, leafs, tubers, seeds, fruits or grains, can be protected in the freshly harvested state or in processed form, such as pre-dried, moistened, comminuted, ground, pressed or roasted, which process is also known as post-harvest treatment. Also falling under the definition of stored products is timber, whether in the form of crude timber, such as construction timber, electricity pylons and barriers, or in the form of finished articles, such as furniture or objects made from wood. Stored products of animal origin are hides, leather, furs, hairs and the like. The combinations according the present invention can prevent disadvantageous effects such as decay, discoloration or mold.\n\nPreferably \"stored products\" is understood to denote natural substances of plant origin and their processed forms, more preferably fruits and their processed forms, such as pomes, stone fruits, soft fruits and citrus fruits and their processed forms.\n\nThe compositions may be used by treating the fungi or the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms to be protected from fungal attack with a fungicidally effective amount of the active substances. The application can be carried out both before and after the infection of the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms by the fungi.\n\nPlant propagation materials may be treated with the inventive compositions or the components thereof, respectively, prophylactically either at or before planting or\n\ntransplanting.\n\nAn agrochemical composition of the invention may comprise a fungicidally effective amount of the components. The term \"effective amount\" denotes an amount of the inventive compositions which is sufficient for controlling harmful fungi on cultivated plants or in the protection of materials and which does not result in a substantial damage to the treated plants. Such an amount can vary in a broad range and is dependent on various factors, such as the fungal species to be controlled, the treated cultivated plant or material, the climatic conditions and the specific compositions used.\n\nCompositions of the invention may also be suitable for efficiently controlling arthropodal pests such as arachnids, myriapedes and insects as well as nematodes.\n\nThe present invention also provides methods for the control of insects, acarids or nematodes comprising contacting the insect, acarid or nematode or their food supply, habitat, breeding grounds or their locus with a pesticidally effective amount of the compositions or the components of the inventive compositions, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the present invention also relates to a method of protecting plants from attack or infestation by insects, acarids or nematodes comprising contacting the plant, or the soil or water in which the plant is growing, with a pesticidally effective amount of an inventive composition or with a pesticidally effective amount of the components of the inventive composition, respectively.\n\nParticularly, the invention relates to a method for the protection of plant propagation material, preferably seeds, from soil insects and of the seedlings' roots and shoots from soil and foliar insects which comprises contacting the plant propagation material as e.g. the seeds before sowing and/or after pregermination with a pesticidally effective amount of an inventive composition or with a pesticidally effective amount of the components of the inventive composition, respectively.\n\nThe invention also provides seeds comprising the inventive composition or the components of the inventive composition, respectively.\n\nMoreover, it has been found that simultaneous, that is joint or separate, application of the active compound(s) of the inventive compositions or successive application (that is immediately one after another and thereby creating the mixture \"in-situ\" on the desired location, as e.g. the plant) of the active compound(s) of the inventive compositions allows enhanced control of pests compared to the control rates that are possible with the individual compounds.\n\nThey may be suitable for efficiently combating the following pests:\n\ninsects from the order of Lepidoptera, for example Achroia grisella, Ac/ens spp. such as A. fimbriana, A. gloverana, A. variana; Acrolepiopsis assectella, Acronicta major, Adoxophyes spp. such as A. cyrtosema, A. orana; Aedia leucomelas, Agrotis spp. such as A. exclamatio- nis.
