        "text": "Pesticidally Active C15-Derivatives of Ginkgolides Description The present invention relates to the use of a compound of formula (I), or a salt, stereoisomer, tautomer, or N-oxide there of,\n\nwherein the variables have a meaning as defined below, as an agrochemical pesticide. It also relates to seeds, pesticidal mixtures and compositions comprising a compound of formula (I). The invention also relates to methods of application of a compound of formula (I), or of the pes- ticidal composition. Another object is a compound of formula (I) per se, as defined below. Invertebrate pests and especially insects, arthropods and nematodes destroy growing and har- vested crops and commercial structures, thereby causing large economic loss to the food sup- ply and to property. While a high number of pesticidal agents are known, due to the ability of tar- get pests to develop resistance to said agents, there is an ongoing need for new agents for combating invertebrate pests such as insects, arachnids and nematodes. There is also a need to find pesticides with favorable ecotoxicological profile, that are safe for the applicant, and which require low application rates as compared to other pestiides. It is desirable that such novel pesticides have a high target specificity, thereby leaving desired species unaffected. Ginkgolides are a pesticidally active group of natural products comprising the compounds ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, ginkgolide J and ginkgolide M. They are commercially available, or can be isolated from extracts of the Ginkgo biloba tree. Table A and formula (II) summarize the chemical identity of the naturally occurring ginkgolides. The asterisk indicates the position of the C15 atom in the ginkgolide scaffold.\n\nTable A: definitions of substituents for naturally occurring ginkgolides of formula (II) It is known that ginkgolides have a pesticidal activity, e.g. insecticidal activity, as described in WO2015/128338, WO2017/025454, WO2017/032580, and WO2016/059240. It is also known to admix ginkgolides to other pesticidally active compounds, as disclosed in WO2016/059240. It is further known from these documents that ginkgolide compounds are particularly effective to combat Pentatomidae pests, which are often comprehensively referred to as stink bugs, and which are extremely hard to control by other conventional pesticides. Natural ginkgolide com- pounds of formula (II) do not fall under the definition of ginkgolide derivatives of formula (I). Certain ginkgolide derivatives have been published inter alia in Ishi et al., Org. Biomol. Chem. (2005), vol.3, p.3471-3472; in Jensen et al., J. Med. Chem. (2007), vol.50, p.1610-1617; in He et al., Spectrochimica Acta Part A (2008), vol.69, p.1213-1222; in Kato et al., Org. Biomol. Chem. (2007), vol.5, p.3758-3761(and its Supplementary Information); in Kawamura et al. (2017), vol.89, p.475-481 (and its Supplementary Information), and in WO2007/002410. How- ever, none of the cited prior art documents on ginkgolide derivatives discloses their use as an agrochemical pesticide.\n\nThere remains a need to find compounds, as well as their uses and methods of application, which have an increased pesticidal effect as compared with the ginkgolide natural products, which reduce their necessary application rates, and display pesticidal activity against difficult to control insects, arachnids and nematodes. Other objectives are reduced off-target effect, an in- creased chemical and physical stability, and/or an improved compatibility with other agrochemi- cally active compounds. It is desirable that such compounds improve or maintain the favorable ecotoxicological profile of ginkgolide natural products, are safe for the applicant, and have a high target specificity, thereby leaving desired species (e.g. bees) unaffected. It has been found that these objectives can be achieved by using certain ginkgolide derivatives that are chemically modified at the C15 atom, i.e. derivatives of ginkgolides that have substitu- ents R1 and R2 at the position as indicated in formula (I) instead of a carbonyl group. Accordingly, there is provided the use of compounds of formula (I), or a salt, stereoisomer, tautomer, or N-oxide thereof\n\nas an agrochemical pesticide, wherein the variables in formula (I) have the following meaning R1, R2 are independently H, halogen, OH, CN, NO2, N3, or SCN;\n\nC1-C10-alkyl, C2-C10-alkenyl, or C2-C10-alkynyl, which groups are unsubstituted, or substituted with one or more, same or different substituents R11;

If individual compounds of formula (I) cannot be produced from the natural product ginkgolides A-M, they may be produced from other compounds of formula (I) by stand- ard chemical reactions.\n\nCompounds of formula (II) may be reduced by the addition of a suitable reducing agent to yield compounds of formula (I-A), having an OH-group attached to C15\n\n, wherein all variables are defined as for compounds of formula (II). Compounds of formula (I-A) are comprised by the definition of compounds of formula (I) and may serve as a basis to gener- ate other compounds of formula (I) by standard methods of organic chemistry.

Compounds of formula (I-H) may be used as starting compounds for all compounds of formula (I), wherein both R1 and R2 are not H.\n\nCompounds of formula (I-J), wherein R1 or R2 is halogen, may be produced by reaction of compounds of formula (I-A) with a suitable deoxygenating-halogenating agent, such as bis(2- methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride, in an inert organic solvent, such as CH2Cl2. Such deoxy- genating-halogenating agents are commercially available. Compounds of formulae (I-A), (I-B), (I-C), (I-D), (I-E), (I-F), (I-G), (I-H) and (I-J) are comprised by the definition of compounds of formula (I).
