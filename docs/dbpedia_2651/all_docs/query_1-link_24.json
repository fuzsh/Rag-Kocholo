        "text": "Introduction Background and Terms of Reference as provided by European Commission Background\n\nThe new Plant Health Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 , on the protective measures against pests of plants, has been applied since December 2019. Provisions within the above Regulation are in place for the listing of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ (Article 42) on the basis of a preliminary assessment, and to be followed by a commodity risk assessment. A list of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ has been published (EU) 2018/2019 . Scientific opinions are therefore needed to support the European Commission and the Member States in the work connected to Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, as stipulated in the terms of reference.\n\nTerms of Reference\n\nIn view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 , the Commission asks EFSA to provide scientific opinions in the field of plant health.\n\nIn particular, EFSA is expected to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities that shall be listed in the relevant Implementing Acts as “High risk plants, plant products and other objects”. Article 42, paragraphs 4 and 5, establishes that a risk assessment is needed as a follow-up to evaluate whether the commodities will remain prohibited, removed from the list and additional measures will be applied or removed from the list without any additional measures. This task is expected to be on-going, with a regular flow of dossiers being sent by the applicant required for the risk assessment.\n\nTherefore, to facilitate the correct handling of the dossiers and the acquisition of the required data for the commodity risk assessment, a format for the submission of the required data for each dossier is needed.\n\nFurthermore, a standard methodology for the performance of “commodity risk assessment” based on the work already done by Member States and other international organizations needs to be set.\n\nIn view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the Commission asks EFSA to provide scientific opinion in the field of plant health for M. domestica from Serbia taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical dossier provided by Serbia.\n\nInterpretation of the Terms of Reference\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Plant Health (hereafter referred to as ‘the Panel’) was requested to conduct a commodity risk assessment of specified plants for planting of Malus domestica Borkh from Serbia (RS) based on the Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high-risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, ).\n\nIn its evaluation the Panel:\n\nChecked whether the information in the technical dossier (hereafter referred to as ‘the Dossier’) provided by the Serbian Authority (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, Plant Protection Directorate – PPD) was sufficient to conduct a commodity risk assessment. When necessary, additional information was requested from the applicant,\n\nSelected the relevant EU-regulated quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (Regulation (EU) 2019/2072), hereafter referred to as ‘EU quarantine pests’) and other relevant pests present in the applicant country and associated with the commodity. Pests listed as union regulated non-quarantine pests (RNQPs) in Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 were not considered for further evaluation,\n\nEvaluated the effectiveness of the proposed measures (as specified by the applicant country) for the selected relevant organisms on the commodity in the applicant country.\n\nRisk management decisions are not within EFSA's remit. Therefore, the Panel will provide a rating for the likelihood of pest freedom for each relevant pest given the risk mitigation measures proposed by the PPD.\n\nData and methodologies Data\n\nThe Panel considered all the data and information (hereafter called ‘the Dossier’) provided by the PPD of Serbia on M. domestica on 8 August 2019, including the additional information provided by the PPD of Serbia on 27th of December and on 14th of February, after EFSA's request. The Dossier is managed by EFSA.\n\nThe structure and overview of the Dossier and the additional material are shown in Table . The number of the relevant section will be indicated in the opinion when referring to a specific part of the Dossier.\n\nStructure and overview of the Dossier and additional material provided by the PPD of Serbia\n\nThe data and supporting information provided by the PPD formed the basis of the commodity risk assessment. Table shows the main data sources used by the PPD to compile the dossier and provide the requested information.\n\nScientific references and technical databases consulted by the PPD of Serbia as provided in the submitted dossier\n\nMethodologies\n\nTo have a comprehensive list of the pests potentially associated with M. domestica in Serbia, a literature search was undertaken by EFSA, in which it was combined: (i) a general search to identify pests of M. domestica in different databases and (ii) a tailored search to identify whether these pests were present or not in Serbia. The searches were run between 28 September and 10 November 2019. No language, date or document type restrictions were applied in the search strategy.\n\nThe Panel used the following databases (Table ) to compile the list of pests associated with M. domestica:\n\nEuropean and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization Global Database\n\nEPPO ( online )\n\nThe European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) Global Database is maintained by the EPPO Secretariat. The aim of the database is to provide all pest-specific information that has been produced or collected by EPPO. It includes host range data, distribution ranges and pest status information.\n\nCABI Crop Protection Compendium\n\nCABI ( online )\n\nThe Crop Protection Compendium is an encyclopaedic resource that brings together a wide range of different types of science-based information on all aspects of crop protection. It comprises detailed datasheets on pests, diseases, weeds, host crops and natural enemies that have been sourced from experts, edited by an independent scientific organisation and enhanced with data from specialist organisations, images, maps, a bibliographic database and full-text articles. New datasheets and data sets continue to be added, datasheets are reviewed and updated and search and analysis tools are being built.\n\nOther databases\n\nIn addition to CABI and EPPO, other databases were used to compile the list of potential pests of M. domestica. The databases used for compiling the pest list are reported in Table . As for Web of Science, the literature search was performed using a specific and ad hoc established search string. The string was run in ‘All Databases’ with no range limits for time or language filters. This will be further discussed in Paragraph 2.2.1.\n\nOther sources\n\nAdditional searches, limited to retrieve documents, were run when developing the opinion. The available scientific information, including previous EFSA opinions on the relevant pests and diseases (see pest sheets in Appendix A) and the relevant literature and legislation (e.g. Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 , Commission implementing regulation (EU) 2018/2018 , Commission implementing regulation (EU) 2018/2019 ) were taken into account.\n\nDatabases used for the compilation of the pest list associated with M. domestica\n\nWhen developing the opinion, the Panel followed the EFSA Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high-risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, ).\n\nFirstly, pests associated with the commodity in the country of origin (EU-regulated pests and other pests) that may require risk mitigation measures were identified. In this opinion, relevant pests not regulated in the EU were selected based on evidence for their potential impact for the EU. After the first step, all the relevant pests that may need risk mitigation measures were identified.\n\nSecondly, the overall efficacy of the proposed risk mitigation measures for each pest was evaluated. A conclusion on the pest freedom status of the commodity for each of the relevant pests was achieved and uncertainties were identified.\n\nCommodity data\n\nBased on the information provided by the PPD of Serbia, the characteristics of the commodity were summarised.\n\nIdentification of pests potentially associated with the commodity\n\nTo evaluate the pest risk associated with the importation of M. domestica from Serbia, a pest list was compiled. The pest list is based on the information provided in the Dossier Section 4 and on the additional searches performed by the Panel. The search strategy and search syntax were adapted to each of the databases listed in Table , according to the options and functionalities of the different databases and CABI keyword thesaurus.\n\nThe scientific name of the host plant (i.e. Malus domestica) was used when searching in the EPPO Global database and CABI Crop Protection Compendium. The same strategy was applied to the other databases excluding Web of Science.\n\nThe search strategy used for the Web of Science Databases was designed combining common names for pests and diseases, terms describing symptoms of plant diseases and the scientific and common names of the commodity. All of the pests already retrieved using the other databases were removed from the search terms to reduce the number of records to be screened. The established search string is detailed in Appendix B and was run on 24 September 2019.\n\nThe titles and abstracts of the scientific papers retrieved were screened and the pests associated with M. domestica were included in the pest list.\n\nAll the pests retrieved using the different databases are included in an Excel file including relevant information for the shortlisting of the pests relevant for this Opinion (i.e. EPPO code per pest, taxonomic information, categorisation, distribution, etc.). The pest list (see Microsoft Excel® file in Appendix C) is a document that includes all the pests potentially associated with Malus domestica retrieved from EPPO GD, CABI CPD and other databases. An overview of the consulted sources is listed in Table .\n\nListing and evaluation of risk mitigation measures\n\nAll currently used risk mitigation measures were listed and evaluated. When evaluating the potential pest freedom of the commodity, the following types of potential infection sources for M. domestica plants in export nurseries and relevant risk mitigation measures=risk reduction options (see glossary) were considered (see also Figure ):\n\npest entry from surrounding areas,\n\npest entry with new plants/seeds,\n\npest spread within the nursery.\n\nThe risk mitigation measures adopted in the plant nurseries (as stated by the PPD) were evaluated by means of an Expert Knowledge Elicitation (EKE) according to the Guidance on uncertainty analysis in scientific assessment (EFSA Scientific Committee, ).\n\nInformation on the biology, estimates of likelihood of entry of the pest to the export nursery and the effect of the measures on the specific pest were summarised in pest datasheets compiled for each pest selected for further evaluation (see Appendix A).\n\nTo estimate the pest freedom of the commodity, a semi-formal EKE was performed following EFSA guidance (Annex B.8 of EFSA Scientific Committee, ). The specific question for the semi-formal EKE was defined as follows: Taking into account (i) the risk mitigation measures in place in the export nurseries, and (ii) other relevant information, how many out of 10,000 pallets with Malus domestica plants will be infested with the relevant pest when arriving in the EU? Given the information provided on production and packaging, it was decided that a pallet would be used as the unit of assessment in the expert knowledge elicitation because during transportation plants can be in contact within a pallet and in consequence, the infection/infestation of a single plant would compromise the pest freedom of the whole pallet. As detailed in the submitted dossier by Serbia, each pallet contains 600–900 individual plants of M. domestica, packaged in net bags containing 10–20 plants. The uncertainties associated with the EKE (expert judgements) on the pest freedom of the commodity for the pest were taken into account and quantified in the probability distribution applying the semi-formal method described in Section 3.5.2 of the EFSA-PLH Guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, ). Finally, the results were reported in terms of the likelihood of pest freedom. The lower 5% percentile of the uncertainty distribution reflects the opinion that pest freedom is with 95% certainty above this limit.\n\nCommodity data Description of the commodity\n\nThe commodity to be imported is M. domestica (common name: Apple; family: Rosaceae) plants. The planting material considered to be imported into the EU from Serbia corresponds to 1- to 2-year-old grafted (see Section 3.3.3 for details) bare root plants sensu ISPM 36 (FAO 2012 Annex1).\n\nThe apple planting material is commercialised in a dormant phenological phase. The intended use of the commodity is the distribution to final consumers (Dossier Section 3.9). Both types of plant material i.e. 1- and 2-year-old plants are marketable from October to May (Dossier Section 3.13).\n\nAlthough the phytosanitary management undertaken is different among the producers – the sanitary status of the plants reflects the standard required by the national legislation of the Republic of Serbia. The sanitary status of the production is controlled by the producers as well via official inspection controls. The plants produced for export are certified plants according to the legislation listed in Section 5 of the Dossier. The volume of the production of plants was 28.622.000 plants per three production seasons and certified plants are representing over 80% of this volume (Dossier Section 3.8). All plants are produced only in registered nurseries under official inspections. Different surveillance schemes are conducted to reduce the risks of pest outbreaks at the place of production. The measures are described and contribute to guarantee of the absence of the specific pests.\n\nDescription of the production areas\n\nThe whole territory of Serbia is production area for apple planting material. The nurseries producing apple plants for export are concentrated in two main regions in Serbia – the Vojvodina region (including the Macva (Sabac)), located in northern Serbia, and the Rasina district located in central Serbia. The map (Figure A) is presenting the location of the 15 major exporters of apple planting material (Dossier Section 3.10–3.11).\n\nBased on the global Köppen–Geiger climate zone classification (Kottek et al., ), the climate of the production areas of M. domestica in Serbia is Cfa i.e. main climate (C): warm temperate; precipitation (f): fully humid; temperature (a): hot summer.\n\nProduction and handling processes Growing conditions\n\nThe growing media used for the production are soil (according to the ISPM 40, FAO ). Soil tests to determine phytosanitary risks are an obligatory prerequisite for establishment of production nurseries in Serbia.\n\nSource of planting material\n\nThe source rootstocks and scions can be either:\n\n−import from the EU (from the Netherlands, for T3 production model, see Section 3.3.3);\n\n−nursery own mother plantation (Dossier Section 3.7).\n\nProduction cycle\n\nThree different production models (i.e. T1, T2 and T3 as designanted in the Serbian dossier) are used in Serbia (Figure ). All plant production is done in open fields; however, grafting for T2 and T3 occurs indoors.\n\nThe production cycle for the three prevailing technologies performed in Serbia over 1- and 2-year vegetation period of apple tree production is presented below (points 1–3, Dossier Section 3.7). The production of 2-year-old plants (T3) is the dominant production method in nurseries in Vojvodina and production models T2 and T3 are dominant in central Serbia (Rasina District).\n\nT1- Apple planting material production process (over a 2-year period, grafting in the field):\n\nPrevious year: plot selection, soil analysis, soil cultivation. November year 1: planting the rootstocks on site.\n\nNovember to August year 1: irrigation, cultivation, fertigation, pest protection of the rootstocks.\n\nAugust year 1: grafting on site (grafting in the field).\n\nAugust year 1 until September year 2: Irrigation, cultivation, fertigation, pest protection of the plants; official inspection controls in June and August.\n\nSeptember year 2: defoliation treatment.\n\nOctober to December year 2: removal of the plants from soil, packaging, delivery or storage in a cold storage.\n\nT2 – Apple planting material production process (1-year period, grafting indoors):\n\nPrevious year: plot selection, soil analysis, soil cultivation. Rotation is done.\n\nJanuary and February year 1: grafting and storage in cold storage until planting.\n\nMarch to April year 1: irrigation system installation; planting the nursery trees; fertigation, pest control.\n\nMay to July year 1: tying plants at fibreglass rods; stripping tape removal, fertigation; first official inspection control in June.\n\nAugust year 1: second official inspection control.\n\nSeptember year 1: defoliation treatment.\n\nOctober to December year 1: taking out the plants from soil, packaging, delivery or storage in cold storage.\n\nT3 – Apple planting material production process (over a 2-year period, grafting indoors):\n\nPrevious year: plot selection, soil analysis, soil cultivation. Rotation is done.\n\nJanuary to February year 1: import of scions and rootstocks from the Netherlands; grafting; storage in cold storage until planting.\n\nMarch and April year 1: irrigation system installation; planting the nursery trees; fertigation Pest control.\n\nMay to July year 1: tying plants at fibreglass rods; stripping tape removal, fertigation; first official inspection control in June.\n\nAugust year 1: optional re-grafting according to cultivar request; second official inspection control.\n\nJanuary year 2: cutting the 1-year-old plants.\n\nApril to July year 2: tying plants at fibreglass rods, fertigation, pest and weed control; first official inspection control.\n\nAugust year 2: second official inspection control.\n\nSeptember year 2: defoliation treatment.\n\nOctober to December year 2: taking out the plants from soil, packaging, delivery or storage in a cold storage.\n\nExport procedure\n\nThe following information was provided by the PPD (Dossier Section 5).\n\nIn accordance with the Council Directive 2000/29 after at least two on-site inspections carried out in that year during the vegetative period in registered nurseries, prior the export, additional export inspection is carried out at the place of loading of propagating material of M. domestica intended for export to the EU.\n\nThe PPD provides technical information to the staff involved in official plant health controls and certification for export on plant health status of harmful organisms and new findings and risks, measures, notifications, specific phytosanitary requirements and additional declarations for import/export, acting in specific cases in international trade pursuant to relevant International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM), as well as communication with NPPOs of other countries.\n\nBefore uprooting the plants, two defoliation treatments are performed with copper chelate at a dose of 10 kg/ha and 1,000 L water/ha in total. The treatments are not sufficient to remove all the leaves, so manual defoliation is also required. The planting material is taken from the soil from October onwards. During uprooting, plants are mechanically shaken to remove soil from roots. Additionally, the remaining soil is removed by washing the plant individually with clean high-pressure water, without any added chemicals. Once the plants are uprooted and washed, they are immediately sorted and placed in bundles. Plant bundles are directly placed, washed, repacked and stored (2°C). Plants are classified based on the quality of adherence at the joint site, the development of the root system and the above-ground part and the age of the plants. The grafting site should be well matched. The plants need to be straight, smooth, unharmed with completely overgrown side branches. The thickness of the plants is not as significant as the development of root system.\n\nPlants for export are sorted into two classes. The first class includes plants with well-developed root systems, normally developed and a well-developed graft connection site. This takes into account the standards set by the national Rulebook on standards of quality, packaging, sealing and marking of propagating material of agricultural plants (OG SFRY No 45/75 and 26/79) which determines that 1-year-old fruit trees for the market should have a root system with at least five base roots 20 cm long. The length of the aboveground part should be at least 1 m, the diameter of the plant directly above the root gate must not be smaller than 10 mm.\n\nThe labelling occurs after the quality check per each plant or by a package of 10 plants.\n\nThe planting material is stored under a controlled regime of temperature and humidity until the delivery for export. Before export, the producer is obliged to announce to PPD the shipment. Then, an official inspection is conducted including a documentation check and a visual inspection of the material for export. The export inspection is carried out at the place of loading of propagating material of M. domestica intended for export to EU. The Phyto certificate for export is issued after official inspection.\n\nThe certified and standard materials are the ones to be exported to EU. On each label at each plant – the category (grade) is specified as well as nursery register number, name of the producer and the headquarter place, number of certificate, name of the grafted cultivar and rootstock, botanical name, plant passport number and label serial number.\n\nThe plants are packed on EU heat treated wooden or metal pallets.\n\nThe 7+ class (plants have seven or more branches circularly spaced, minimum length of branches 25 cm): 600–800 plants per pallet. The number varies depending on the apple variety.\n\nThe 5+ class: 800–900 plants per pallet.\n\nThe 3+ or spurred (plants with three or more branches shorter than 25 cm): 1,100–1,200 plants can fit per pallet.\n\nThe ‘unfeather’ class (plants with two, one or no branches): 1,500 plants can fit per pallet.\n\nThe plants are packed exclusively in nets. Ten plants are packed as a bundle in a net, except for the ‘unfeather’ class, that allows a tighter bundling with 20 plants packed together. The bundles therefore consist of 10 (or up to 20) plants. After the pallet is packed, an additional paper label is added describing what is on the pallet (e.g. variety name, pallet number, plant class and total number of plants per pallet). Usually the paper labels are on both sides of the pallet. The number of plants per pallet depends on planting material quality class. The consignment consisted of 6,000–9,000 plants per truck.\n\nThe export of planting material to the EU occurs between October and March/April. The export volumes to the EU in 2018 and 2019 (between January and March) amounted to approximately 2,308.000 and 607.000 apple plants, respectively. The planned volumes in 2020 and in following years were based on market requirements although the operators were expecting a positive trend.\n\nSurveillance system in Serbia\n\nAccording to Dossier Section 5.3 and the additional information provided to EFSA, apple planting material is under permanent surveillance and monitoring. The process is under official control and there are official records of the production surveillance in all registered nurseries. The procedures and protocols for the commodity – Apple planting material are in line with EPPO Standards PM 4/27 (1) Certification scheme on pathogen-tested material of Malus, Pyrus and Cydonia, PM 3/76 (1) Trees of Malus, Pyrus, Cydonia and Prunus spp. – inspection of places of production and PM 3/72 (1) Elements common to inspection of places of production, area-wide surveillance, inspection of consignments and lot identification.\n\n○Registration\n\nPlanting material production can be performed only by a legal person and entrepreneur registered in Register of propagating material producers.\n\nThis Register is maintained by the PPD (112 active registered apple producers, total number of all registered producers of planting material is 400).\n\nProducers have to annually report the production of propagating material.\n\nProducers keep all records of production and marketing of propagating material.\n\nThe PPD issues a decision by which the producer of planting material is registered in this Register and assigns a unique registration number.\n\n○Application\n\nThe registered producer of the planting material in the approval process must submit a production application as well as an application for plant health inspections on the prescribed forms and within the prescribed deadlines.\n\nThe application shall be accompanied by appropriate documentation. Applications are submitted for each location where production is made, separately. There is a check on the origin of the used propagating material (species, variety and category).\n\nThe producer is obliged to submit the detailed production plan.\n\nThe application shall be accompanied by the proof of the origin of the planting material.\n\nThe producer of planting material is obliged to provide the certificates of the health inspection of soil and substrates, as well as the certificates of health status of the rootstocks and scions (buds) for planting material within the prescribed deadlines.\n\nHealth inspection of the soil and substrate for the presence of nematodes is carried out once a year, 30 days before the beginning of the production – the establishment of planting, and every fourth year in the mother plantation, before the vegetation starts.\n\nApplications are submitted on the prescribed forms in two copies.\n\n○Official control inspection (mandatory)\n\nControl inspections are conducted on the basis of the application by the producer. It is conducted by categories and by plant species at least twice per vegetation type. Documentary check is performed to determine the origin of used propagating material, species, variety and category.\n\nPlant health checks in objects/areas for production of propagating material are carried out during the growing season to determine the presence of pests and diseases. If the propagating material meets the prescribed requirements, Certificates are issued on the origin of the propagating material and on plant health condition\n\nHealth checks apply to:\n\nApple planting material;\n\nSoil and substrate;\n\nPlants that are potential host of harmful organisms, as well as plants located in the immediate environment of plantings or facilities.\n\nAt least two visual inspections are mandatory, first when the plants' characteristics of species and cultivars are the most pronounced and therefore, symptoms of plant diseases and pests can be best seen; second, when plants express a uniform development and it is possible to estimate yield.\n\nIf forecasted environmental conditions (e.g. moisture, temperature) could favour the establishment of a pathogen, and outbreaks are suspected, plant health checks are performed more than twice per year.\n\nPlant health checks of crops and facilities are performed in the presence of producers. On each control, a report is written, signed by the responsible person from the producer side and authorised persons.\n\nPlant health checks of soil and substrates for the presence of nematodes is performed once a year, 30 days before starting the production – establishment of crops, 30 days before establishment of facilities and every fourth year in mother plantations, before the starting of vegetation.\n\nReport on the results of completed testing on the presence of nematodes, as well as tests for viruses, is an integral part of the records.\n\nIf the control determines that the propagating material does not meet the conditions specified by law and its implementing regulations, plant material must be destroyed in the presence of phytosanitary inspectors.\n\nIf the control determines that the planting material meets all the requirements prescribed, authorised Agricultural Service issues Certificate on plant health condition, and Plant Protection Directorate, Certificate on propagating material production.\n\n○Plant passport and labelling\n\nAfter obtaining the Certificate on production, the producer is filling application to phytosanitary inspection for printing labels for all categories of propagating material. Label has a unique serial number and it is labelling the propagating material in the market. Plant passport is part of label. Traceability is ensured to the place of production. Printing labels are carried out by the authorised organisation. Colour of label is prescribed for each category of plant material. Authorised organisation shall keep record of issued labels.\n\nWhen marketing, propagating material must match the declared variety, the prescribed standards of quality, health, originally packaged and labelled (individually or in a group).\n\nCategories of plant material are:\n\nPre-basic: Pre-basic propagating material is reproductive material produced under the responsibility of the breeder or his/her agents, used for the production of basic plant material, and it has been tested according to the latest international standards for the presence of diseases and pests. It is held in strict conditions with no possibility for infection.\n\nBasic: The basic planting material is reproductive material derived from pre-basic propagating material used for production of certified planting material, produced in mother plantations under the control of an authorised organisation. It is marked with a white label.\n\nCertified: Certified planting material is propagating material created from the basic planting materials intended for the production of certified plants or production of standard plant material. It is marked with a blue label.\n\nStandard: Standard planting material is reproductive planting material originated by reproduction of certified material and is intended for the production of standard plants. It is marked with orange certificate.\n\nStandard marked with the label S-A in distribution. Standard planting material originated by reproduction of standard plants, or from mother plants approved in accordance with the Law on Seeds and Propagating Material (Official Gazette of RS No. 54/93), or for species that do not have a certification scheme, it is marked in distribution with certificate of orange colour and with special label S-A.\n\n○National surveys\n\nEvery year the PPD prepares and organises activities for conducting two programmes:\n\nProgram of Measures for Plant Health.\n\nProgram of monitoring, forecasting and reporting of pests, as part of support to producers and exporters related to improve the plant health status.\n\nThe Program of Measures for Plant Health aims at the prevention, early detection, monitoring, suppression and eradication of harmful organisms on plants. This Program defines the actual measures, time limits, manner of implementing those measures, the entities that will implement them, sources of funds and manner of provision and use of the funds, as well as the manner of controlling the implementation of the measures.\n\nIn accordance with this Program of Measures for Plant Health, every year there are surveys to determine the status regarding a number of pests i.e. Alternaria mali, Apple proliferation phytoplasma, Erwinia amylovora, Globodera pallida, Globodera rostochiensis, Clavibacter michiganensins subsp. sepedonicus, Synchitrium endobioticum.\n\nFor new emerged phytosanitary problems, PPD organises standing expert committees in order to solve the problem.\n\nIdentification of pests potentially associated with the commodity\n\nIn total the search for potential pests associated with M. domestica rendered 1191 species. From these 1,191 pests, there were 22 parasitic plant species, 2 gastropods, 537 fungi and oomycetes, 527 insects and mites, 21 bacteria, 32 nematodes and 50 viruses, viroids and phytoplasmas; 93 species were EU-regulated (i.e. 48 were Union quarantine pests or Protected Zones Union Quarantine Pests and 45 were RNQPs).\n\nSelection of relevant EU-quarantine pests associated with the commodity\n\nThe EU listing of Union quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (Commission Implementing Regulation EU/2019/2072 ) is based on assessments concluding that the pest can enter, establish, spread and have potential impact in the EU.\n\nFor the 48 EU-quarantine species reported to use M. domestica as a host plant, the relevance for this opinion was based on evidence that:\n\na)the pest is present in Serbia;\n\nb)M. domestica is a host of the pest;\n\nc)one or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity.\n\nPests that fulfilled all criteria were selected for further evaluation (Table ).\n\nTable gives an overview of the evaluation of the 48 EU-quarantine pest species that are reported to use M. domestica as a host in regards of their relevance for this opinion. For more information, see also Appendix C (Microsoft Excel file).\n\nOf the 93 EU-regulated species evaluated, 38 pests were present in Serbia, and of these, one species was relevant for further assessment.\n\nOverview of EU-quarantine pest species considered for this opinion\n\n5Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072.\n\n6BAC: Bacteria; FUN: Fungi and oomycetes; INS: Insects and mites; NEM: Nematodes; VIR: Viruses, viroids and phytoplasmas.\n\n7Association with the commodity is evaluated only if the pest is present in Serbia and uses Malus domestica as a host.\n\n8Additional remarks.\n\nSelection of other relevant pests (not regulated in the EU) associated with the commodity\n\nThe information provided by the PPD of Serbia was evaluated to assess whether there are other relevant pests of M. domestica present in the country of export. For these potential pests that are not regulated in the EU, pest risk assessment information on the probability of entry, establishment, spread and impact is usually lacking. Therefore, these non-regulated pests that are potentially associated with M. domestica in Serbia were also evaluated to determine whether they were absent from the EU and whether there was evidence for potential impact in the EU.\n\nThus, the relevance of other pests (not regulated in the EU) for this opinion was based on evidence that:\n\nthe pest is present in Serbia;\n\nthe pest is absent or has limited distribution in the EU;\n\nthe pest uses Malus domestica as a host;\n\none or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity;\n\nthe pest may have an impact and can pose a potential risk for the EU territory.\n\nPests that fulfilled all criteria were selected for further evaluation.\n\nSpecies were excluded from further evaluation when at least one of the conditions listed above (i–v) was not met. Details can be found in the Appendix C (Microsoft Excel file). Of the 1,099 non-EU-regulated species evaluated, 242 species are absent or have limited distribution in the EU. None of the non-regulated pests were selected for further evaluation because they did not meet all the selection criteria.\n\nOverview of interceptions\n\nBased on the information provided by the applicant, the number of plants of M. domestica exported to the EU from Serbia in 2018 and 2019 (between January and March) was approximately 2,308.000 and 607,000, respectively.\n\nData on the interception of harmful organisms on plants of M. domestica can provide information on some of the organisms that can be present on the exported plants despite the current measures taken. Based on the information available in the EUROPHYT database, no interceptions of pests have been detected on plants of M. domestica imported in the EU from Serbia between 1995 and 2019.\n\nList of potential pests not further assessed\n\nFrom the list of pests not selected for further evaluation, the Panel raised questions on two species i.e. Tomato Ringspot Virus (TORSV0) and Tobacco Ringspot Virus (TRSV00) (listed in Table D.1 in Appendix D), after the revision of additional information provided by the Serbian NPPO, the currently available evidence confirms the absence of these two species in the Serbian territory and hence, provides no reason to select these species for further evaluation in this opinion. The status of these two viruses on the EPPO region is uncertain.\n\nSummary of pests selected for further evaluation\n\nOne pathogen identified to be present in Serbia and considered to be reasonably likely to be associated with M. domestica is listed in Table . For this selected pathogen, the currently applied risk mitigation measures applied for the commodity were evaluated.\n\nPest selected for further evaluation\n\n9BAC: bacteria.\n\nRisk mitigation measures\n\nFor Erwinia amylovora, the Panel assessed the possibility that it could be present in a M. domestica export nursery and assessed the probability that pest freedom of a consignment is achieved by the proposed risk mitigation measures (i.e. RROs) acting on the pest under consideration.\n\nAll the information used in the evaluation of the pest presence and risk mitigation measures for the pest is summarised in a pest datasheet (see Appendix A).\n\nPossibility of pest presence in the export nurseries\n\nFor E. amylovora, the Panel evaluated the possibility that the pathogen could be present in a M. domestica nursery by evaluating the possibility that M. domestica in the export nursery are infected either by:\n\nIntroduction of the pathogen (e.g. insects, propagules) from the environment surrounding the nursery.\n\nIntroduction of the pathogen with new plants/seeds.\n\nSpread of the pathogen within the nursery.\n\nRisk mitigation measures applied in Serbia\n\nThe Dossier Section 5.1 contains information on the phytosanitary mitigation measures related to the plant of interest (M. domestica) where it has been reported:\n\nCertification scheme established in 2005 by the Regulation (Law on propagating material of fruits, vine and hops) and harmonised with EPPO.\n\nSpatial isolation is part of the regulation for the certified apple planting material and it is regulated as defined by the Rulebook on health checks of crops and facilities for the production of seeds, planting material and health status of seed and planting material ((‘Official Gazette SRY’, No 66/99 i 13/2002, ‘Official Gazette SCG’, No 10/2003 i 13/2003 i ‘Official Gazette RS’, No 39/2006, 59/2006, 115/2006, 119/2007 i 107/2008).\n\nFor the commodity export in EU, soil control is an obligatory step in the process of establishment of nurseries for production and each year and soil analyses are mandatory in the process of application for the production each year.\n\nThe nurseries are performing chemical (pesticide) treatments.\n\nPlant passport system and labelling.\n\nInspection prior to export.\n\nWith the information provided by the PPD of Serbia (Dossier Section 3 and 5), the Panel summarised the risk mitigation measures (Table ) that are currently applied in the production nurseries. It was noted that the applicant country implements measures for E. amylovora that are consistent with the requirements for plants of Malus that are detailed in Annex X of 2019/2072 (Item 9).\n\nOverview of the currently applied risk mitigation measures for M. domestica plants designated for export to the EU from Serbia described as reported in the PPD declaration and classified according to the type of Risk Reduction Options (RROs) listed in EFSA PLH Panel ( )\n\nEvaluation of the current measures for the selected relevant pests including uncertainties\n\nFor the pathogen, E. amylovora, the effective risk mitigation measures were identified. Any limiting factors on the effectiveness of the measures were documented. All the relevant information including the related uncertainties deriving from the limiting factors used in the evaluation are summarised in a pest datasheet provided in Appendix A.\n\nBased on this information, an expert judgement has been given for the likelihood of pathogen freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest and their combination (Table ).\n\nAn overview of the evaluation of the pest is given in the section below (Section 5.3.1).\n\nSummary of Erwinia amylovora pest datasheet\n\nAssessment of the likelihood of pest freedom following evaluation of current risk mitigation measures against Erwinia amylovora on M. domestica designated for export to the EU. In panel A, the median value for the assessed level of pest freedom for each pest is indicated by ‘M’, the 5% percentile is indicated by L and the 95% percentile is indicated by U. The percentiles together span the 90% uncertainty range regarding pest freedom. The pest freedom categories are defined in panel B of the table\n\n1000BAC: bacteria.\n\nConclusions\n\nThere is one pest, E. amylovora, identified to be present in Serbia and considered to be potentially associated with M. domestica plants and relevant for the EU. For this pathogen, the likelihood of pest freedom after the evaluation of the currently proposed risk mitigation measures applied on M. domestica destined for export to the EU was estimated. Considering a pallet as a unit and taking into account the uncertainties associated with the assessment, the Panel is 95% sure that 9,934 or more pallets out of 10,000 will be pest free.\n\nNotes:\n\n2001Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament of the Council of 26 October 2016 on protective measures against pests of plants, amending Regulations (EU) 228/2013, (EU) 652/2014 and (EU) 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 69/464/EEC, 74/647/EEC, 93/85/EEC, 98/57/EC, 2000/29/EC, 2006/91/EC and 2007/33/EC.

Organism information A.2. Possibility of pest presence in the nursery A.2.1. Possibility of entry from the surrounding environment\n\nNatural spread is very likely through wind, water, rain, insects (especially pollinating insects), birds, aerosols and aerial strands (Keil et al., 1972). Infection takes place through flowers and later in the season, through small wounds (by winds, hail, insects) in young leaves and at the tips of growing shoots (CABI CPC, Online). Erwinia amylovora also can survive on other healthy plant surfaces, such as leaves and branches, for limited periods (weeks), but colony establishment and epiphytic growth on these surfaces does not occur. Cells of E. amylovora excrete large amounts of an extracellular polysaccharide (a major component of bacterial ooze), which creates a matrix that protects the pathogen on plant surfaces (Johnson, 2000). Once established, the transport of inoculum is possible through rain and wind. E. amylovora can survive for several weeks in pollen, nectar, honey and fruit flies (EFSA Scientific Opinion, 2014).\n\nAdditionally, human factors pose a high risk in E. amylovora dispersion through machines, equipment, pruning, spraying tools, shoes, clothes, etc. (VKM, 2007).\n\nIn Serbia, E. amylovora was first detected in 1989 near Šabac (where Fleunerra nursery is located) and continued spreading in the West, Southern and Central part of Serbia until the end of 1992. Until the end of 1996, E. amylovora was found in Vojvodina region (where five exporting nurseries are located), mainly on apple trees. In 1997, an infected individual of Pyracantha coccinea (firethorn) was found to be hosting the bacteria in Serbia; in 2000, it was found on apple and quince seedlings in the Southern part of Serbia. The same year, there was a severe epiphytotic outbreak during the first half of May where fire blight was registered in Vojvodina's Southern Bačka region on apple plantations (Jedinstvo and Irmovo) on an area of 400 ha. Two new hosts were found in Vojvodina Province: Cotoneaster horizontalis and Chaenomeles japonica. In 2008, in the Southern part of Bačka County (where some apple nurseries are located), asymptomatic samples from plantations (mainly apples) were found positive in the bacteria, analysed by molecular methods. Eradication has been conducted mainly in apple orchards in Vojvodina region (2008) and in Rasina district (2007). However, asymptomatic samples from apple nurseries were found negative (Balaž et al., 2013). In 2016, there was an occurrence of Erwinia amylovora (exact location is not mentioned) but not an epiphytic outbreak on apple (Response Letter, D4 a).\n\nVisual inspections around (mother) nurseries and production areas are conducted on regular bases as explained above. In the Vojvodina region, nurseries are surrounded by field crops (wheat, maize, sugar beet, oil crops like sunflowers, soybean, oil rape, etc.) which do not host E. amylovora. In the Rasina district, apple plant production areas are grouped and the isolation belts of 500 and 1,000 m around mother and production nurseries overlap.\n\nUncertainties:\n\nDistances of surveillance belts around nurseries production areas are not clearly defined, taking into consideration the overlap between mother and production nurseries.\n\nAssisted dispersal of the bacteria by animals and abiotic factors can bridge the distances\n\nIf dispersal from infected hosts surrounding production nurseries occurs after inspection in the two defined periods, the plant/tree may carry the disease asymptomatically.\n\nBased on the information we have from the Dossier and the reply from Serbia, it is uncertain to what extent the visual inspection is effective. Based on the months defined and the lack of information on phenology, it is possible that the inspections might be occurring late in the flowering season. Therefore, inspections may not be 100% effective.\n\nThere is a possibility for latent infections that remain unnoticed even after visual inspections.\n\nConcerning the epiphytic/endophytic growth, survival is still likely at very low temperatures, so cold treatment might not be effective treatment to eliminate or prevent the bacteria.\n\nThe EPPO Standards and Diagnostic Protocols for regulated pests PM 7/20 that are followed (Table 8, p. 63, Dossier) can be effective at high bacterial population levels but the effectiveness is uncertain at low population levels.\n\nIn case diagnostics of symptomatic samples are carried out, it is not clear how the sampling is done, and which diagnostic protocol is used. Referring only to the diagnostic protocol PM 7/20, is too general. Also, the sampling protocol provided in Annex II, are too general information, but details are lacking.\n\nAccording to the additional information provided by Serbia in Annex IV, two samples showing symptoms of E. amylovora were tested but gave a negative result, given that details on the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests are lacking, there is uncertainty on the sensitivity level of the used methods and therefore on the reliability of the obtained results.\n\nTaking into consideration the above evidence and uncertainties, the Panel considers that it is possible for the pathogen to enter the nursery from the surrounding area. Pathogen is present in Serbia and in the past, it has been detected in areas surrounding or near apple producing areas i.e. mother nurseries and production nurseries. Although there are thorough inspections in production areas and there are demarcated belts around (mother and production) nurseries that are also inspected, the pathogen, if present and the environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) allow it, could infect plants for planting. Also, the assisted dispersal via insects, birds and/or in-farm orchard management may allow the spread of the pathogen.\n\nA.2.2. Possibility of entry with new plants/seeds\n\nThere are two possible pathways for introduction of the pathogen, introductions from other countries via infected material and reintroductions and spread within the country. The main long-distance pathway is mainly the import of infected nursery stock and propagative material (Roberts et al., 2008) since the pathogen can live as an epiphyte or an endophyte in buds and shoots (EFSA Scientific Opinion, 2014).\n\nAccording to the Dossier (page 6), the main production models in Serbian nurseries are T2 plants (1-year old) and T3 plants (2-year old). Concerning the production model T3, scions and rootstocks are imported from the Netherlands. Regarding the production model T2, origin of scions and rootstocks is not specified (it could be either import from EU or Serbian mother plantation).\n\nUncertainties:\n\nThe production of T3 plants relies on plant material imported from the Netherlands. Given that E. amylovora is present in the Netherlands and that details on the phytosanitary status of that material is not provided in the dossier, there is a theoretical level of uncertainty (although unlikely in practicality) regarding the potential infection of that plant material.\n\nThere is uncertainty on whether mother nurseries are importing plant material from other EU or non-EU countries, as done with the Dutch material and therefore, there is a theoretical possibility of entrance through other planting material.\n\nTaking into consideration the above evidence and uncertainties, the Panel considers that although technically unlikely, it is possible that the pathogen could enter the nursery with new plants/seeds or soil growing media. Erwinia amylovora is present and widespread although at low prevalence in the Netherlands (EPPO), given the fact that part of the material is coming from the Netherlands it cannot be excluded that the pathogen may also be introduced via this material. The Plants for planting specified in the dossier are also produced by grafting from material produced in other local nurseries, again, it cannot be excluded the introduction of the pathogen with plant material grown in Serbia.\n\nA.2.3. Possibility of spread within the nursery\n\nHigh level of soil moisture (by rain or irrigation), wind and temperature between 18°C and 30°C can lead to rapid disease development (VKM, 2007). E. amylovora can retain its pathogenic potential at temperatures ranging from 4°C (sometimes even lower) to 37°C (Santander et al., 2017). Movement of machineries/equipment and even pruning is a significant pathway. (VKM, 2007).\n\nConcerning the apple planting material production process in Serbia, the main treatments are: grafting, fertigation, pest control, soil cultivation, defoliation (two treatments with copper chelate and manually), uprooting and root shaking and washing, packaging, delivery or cold storage (2°C) until spring, if not sold in November. Plant roots are washed individually with water under pressure, without any added chemicals. (Response Letter, B10).\n\nGrafting could be a possible pathway since in propagation nurseries, cells of E. amylovora surviving on woody surfaces can initiate disease when scions and rootstocks are wounded during grafting. E. amylovora also, can reside as an endophyte within apparently healthy plant tissue, such as branches, limbs and budwood. Migration of the pathogen through xylem is one mechanism by which floral infections of apple can lead to rootstock infections near the graft union (Johnson, 2000). Moreover, dispersion is highly likely through insects (especially pollinating), birds (Keil et al., 1972) and human factors (CABI CPC, Online).\n\nUncertainties:\n\nUndetected latent infections in hosting trees in the buffer zones may be the source for spread to mother and production areas.\n\nAlthough the steps in production of the different plant material are explained in the dossier, the specific management of plants in the nursery is not detailed and therefore, there are uncertainties on to what extent common management practices in the cultivation of apple could favour the spread of the disease.\n\nThere are uncertainties on the effectiveness of chemical and other treatments to deal with insect pests. As we do not know population sizes of phytophagous or pollinating insects going from tree to tree in the nurseries, there are uncertainties on likelihood of spread via insects within the nursery.\n\nTaking into consideration the above evidence and uncertainties, the Panel considers that the transfer of the pathogen within the nursery is possible. As explained above, E. amylovora can be spread by means of abiotic factors (water, wind) and also by insects (especially pollinators), and given the fact that the bacterium is present in Serbia and the close proximity among the nurseries in the production areas, spread of the bacterium can occur easily under favourable environmental conditions. Also, in farm management, e.g. the use of beehives and pollinators in apple production areas, or the use of machinery and tools can also spread the disease and therefore, there is a theoretical risk of spread within apple production areas that cannot be neglected.\n\nA.3. Information from interceptions\n\nConsidering imports of M. domestica plants from Serbia to the EU, between 1995 and 2019 (until November), there are no records of interceptions of E. amylovora (EUROPHYT, online).\n\nA.4. Evaluation of the risk reduction options\n\nIn the table below, all the RROs currently applied in Serbia are summarised and an indication of their effectiveness on ERWIAM is provided.\n\nA.5. Overall likelihood of pest freedom A.6. Eicitation outcomes of the assessment of the pest freedom for Erwinia amylovora\n\nTo perform the EKE, the WG put forward the following scenarios\n\nA.6.1. Reasoning for a scenario which would lead to a reasonably low number of infested consignments\n\nThe surveillance scheme conducted by Serbia is complete. Serbia follows EPPO standards, using the best techniques available. Surveillances in production areas and demarcated belts are working effectively and taking place during the most suitable periods for the detection of the pest symptoms. Few latent infections occur and are in any case detected. Given the proximity of production nurseries to mother nurseries, production nurseries benefit from the strict monitoring occurring in mother nurseries. In the production areas (in the Vojvodina region in particular), nurseries and mother plantations are surrounded by field crops where no hosts of E. amylovora are present. Planting material is healthy and mother plants are under protected conditions that prevent infection. Management practices are adapted to reduce infections and vectors are controlled sufficiently. Infected material will not leave the production nursery and will not be exported. Cold storage (2°C) is effective in preventing the spread of the disease.\n\nA.6.2. Reasoning for a scenario which would lead to a reasonably high number of infested consignments\n\nInspections and surveillance schemes are not effective, and protocols used for the detection of the pathogen are not sensitive enough. Inspection periods might miss the right moment for the detection of the bacterium. Detection in the surveillances is not effective due to lack of clear symptoms and/or wrong timing. Also, latent infections are not detected. Surveillance of other potential hosts is difficult to perform (e.g. private gardens).\n\nSurveillance belts around production areas are not properly demarcated and/or too small allowing the spread and/or preventing pathogen confinement. Mother plantations and nurseries are surrounded by orchards (other host plants) where the pathogen may be present. Climatic conditions and vector populations could favour the emergence and spread of the disease. High prevalence of vectors carrying the pathogen (e.g. infected bee-hives). Material imported from the Netherlands may be infected and mother nurseries import infested material from other areas where the bacteria is present. Management practices (e.g. pruning) may spread latent infections or enable introduction.\n\nA.6.3. Reasoning for a central scenario equally likely to over- or underestimate the number of infested consignments (median)\n\nThe experts agreed on the fact that the median value i.e. a value separating the higher half from the lower half of the data sample was skewed to the left, as the most likely scenario under the production conditions presented in the dossier are those of pest freedom with very low bacteria prevalence, which would result in a relatively low number of infested consignments. In other words, a scenario where visual inspections are effective in detecting symptoms of infection in nurseries, production areas and demarcated belts. At the same time, production and management in farm follows general phytosanitary standards.\n\nA.6.4. Reasoning for the precision of the judgement describing the remaining uncertainties (first and third quartile/interquartile range)\n\nThe experts agreed that first quartile value (7 infested of 10 000) represented a between the 1% and the 50% values (1 and 15). For the third quartile value, the experts agreed that most likely value (25 infested of 10 000) was closer to the median value, reflecting the production conditions presented in the dossier which would result in a relatively low number of infested consignments.\n\nElicited and fitted values for E. amylovora agreed by the Panel are shown in Tables A.1 and A.2 and in the Figure A.1.\n\nA.1 Elicited and fitted values of the uncertainty distribution of pest infestation by E. amylovora per 10,000 pallets\n\nThe EKE results is the Lognormal distribution (21.886, 26.42) fitted to the elicited values with @Risk version 7.5.\n\nBased on the numbers of estimated infected pallets, the likelihood of estimated pest freedom was calculated. The fitted values of the uncertainty distribution of the likelihood of pest freedom are shown in table.\n\nA.2 The uncertainty distribution of pallets free of E. amylovora per 10,000 pallets calculated by Table A.1\n\nThe EKE results are the fitted values.\n\nReferences\n\nBalaž J, Grahovac M, Radunović D, Iličić R, and Krstić M, 2013.
