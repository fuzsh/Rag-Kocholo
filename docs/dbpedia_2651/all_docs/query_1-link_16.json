        "text": "Most European rivers and lakes are found in the Nordic countries; hence it is not surprising that freshwater assessments are an essential and mandatory part of Nordic environmental monitoring programs. For inland and coastal waters, monitoring requirements are largely determined by requirements of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC), adopted by all Nordic countries. The WFD aims to protect and enhance the status of aquatic ecosystems and to promote sustainable water use in rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters and groundwaters. Given the large amount of water bodies in the Nordic countries, the demands of the WFD for biological monitoring and subsequent taxonomical identification requires considerable expertise and financial resources. To deal with these financial burdens, agencies and environmental managers are currently considering options that could replace costly and time-consuming procedures such as morphological identification. Depending on the organisms, different molecular techniques have recently been suggested as viable alternatives to current identification methods.\n\nAquatic macroinvertebrates are frequently used in WFD monitoring of both rivers and lakes as their responses to environmental pressures such as eutrophication, acidification and hydro-morphological alterations are well known and predictable (Johnson et al. 1993). However, identification of specimens to species-level by morphology is often both time consuming and difficult due to challenging taxonomy and high diversity. As an alternative to morphological identification, a molecular technique termed “DNA metabarcoding” can be used to potentially identify all species in a bulk sample using standardized stretches of their DNA (so-called “DNA barcodes”). DNA metabarcoding has proven to be very effective for species detection and identification in many studies, if a well-developed reference library can be used in the identification process. More work is needed on reference library development as well as laboratory and bioinformatic methods to improve estimates of biomass and abundance. While individual case studies indicate the efficacy of metabarcoding in monitoring and assessment programs using macroinvertebrates, no concerted, large-scale tests on suitability and accuracy have thus far been performed. Moreover, no information is available concerning changes needed before adopting this approach in routine Nordic aquatic monitoring.\n\nIn this Nordic validation study, we assessed if DNA metabarcoding has the potential to produce the same level of taxonomic information as current methods based on traditional morphological identification. Specifically, we tested whether these new methods result in improved processing speeds, comparability and cost efficiency, and assessed whether the implementation of these new methods will affect ongoing assessment processes, i.e. the current metrics or classifications of ongoing assessment systems.\n\nIt is noteworthy, that the rapidly advancing field of molecular research currently lacks guidance documents or international standards for implementing molecular methods in routine monitoring. The Nordic members of the SCANDNAnet consortium consists of researchers involved with national WFD monitoring and/or international method standardization in their respective countries. This uniquely positions the Nordic agencies participating in this validation effort as auditors of the metabarcoding approach also allowing them to advance the creation of joint, standardized protocols under the umbrella of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). The need for guidance on molecular methods for use in aquatic biomonitoring has been identified by CEN. In 2019, the first dedicated workgroup on “DNA and eDNA methods” was established by the technical committee for Water Quality standards.\n\n3.2. Taxonomic identification methods\n\n3.2.1 Morphological identification\n\nIn all Nordic countries, morphological identifications of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring are done by taxonomic experts. After sample collection, the macroinvertebrates and detritus are preserved in the field according to national guidelines, transported to the laboratory and sorted from debris (see 4.1.1). Macroinvertebrates are identified by microscopy to national minimum levels of taxonomic resolution. All Nordic experts keying macroinvertebrates use nationally defined minimum levels of identification which often include different levels taxonomic resolution, and which are specifically optimized for manual identification. To shorten processing times as well as due to limited taxonomic expertise, the standardized identification protocols often do not include the identification of certain groups to the species level, such as chironomids or oligochaetes in lake littoral or river habitats. Taxon groups usually keyed to species level include EPT-taxa (Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), Trichoptera (caddisflies)) as well as dragonflies and molluscs. EU Water Framework Directive compliant biomonitoring in the Nordic countries involves sampling many water body types, with each sample comprised of many specimens that need to be identified. For example, even in relatively species-poor regions like northern Finland, the calculation of the EU WFD related indices involves the identification of 44-113 lotic benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, depending on the water body type (Aroviita et al. 2019). Due to the inherent time-consuming identification process, traditional manual identification constitutes a bottleneck in bioassessments often resulting in significant time lags between sampling and the data availability. The growing need for more biomonitoring combined with declines in funding and in the number of taxonomic experts necessitates the exploration of alternative processes for reliable and comparable species identification (e.g. Elbrecht et al. 2017, Ärje et al. 2020). In addition, the high abundance of specimens in a sample poses a bottleneck and financial constraint to the identification of taxa to the most precise taxonomic level. Hering et al. (2004) identified three commonly used approaches to address the issues when samples contain high numbers of specimens: (1) analysing only a subset of the sample (e.g. Norway), or (2) the use of a coarser than genus or species identification or (3) a combination of both approaches.\n\n3.2.2 DNA metabarcoding\n\nDNA metabarcoding potentially allows for the identification of most macroinvertebrate species in a bulk sample without the added cost of sorting (Taberlet et al., 2012, Hajibabaei et al. 2019, Pereira-da-Conceicoa et al. 2020). By sequencing a short, standardized gene fragment (i.e. DNA barcode, Hebert et al. 2003) of DNA extracted and amplified from a homogenized macroinvertebrate sample and comparing the resulting sequences to DNA reference sequences of morphologically identified species, species lists of the complete sample can be obtained. In this process, millions of sequences are generated by high throughput sequencing, which are typically quality filtered and clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by similarity. One OTU roughly corresponds to one phylogenetic species that is associated with a Linnean name if the species is present in the reference library. However, the cluster can match several species if genetic divergence between species is low (rarely the case for the marker used here or for the WFD macroinvertebrate species identified), or conversely there can be multiple OTUs for the same species identification if there is high genetic divergence within a species. These OTUs, however, are normally assigned to only a single species. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage that it allows for rapid identification of hundreds of samples, when employing laboratory automatization like processing samples in parallel (96-well plate format) or utilising robotics. Additionally, as the same methods are used across samples, the results are more objective and thus more comparable than morphological identification by different taxonomists (Haase et al. 2010, Sweeney et al. 2011). With reliable reference databases, specimens in the sample are often identified to species level. Sometimes even population genetic analysis is possible (Elbrecht et al. 2018).\n\nHowever, metabarcoding also has some methodological drawbacks and there are several variables that can potentially influence the results. These include laboratory methods and protocols used, for instance in how DNA is extracted from the sample. Several studies have shown that DNA metabarcoding using DNA isolated from homogenized samples provides a better estimate of the species composition in the sample than DNA isolated from the preservative (Erdozain et al. 2019; Zizka et al. 2018); although other studies have shown that the differences between the two methods are not substantial (Gauthier et al. 2019; Hajibabaei et al. 2012). Organisms that have a hard exoskeletons or exterior cases, such as some freshwater beetles, insects and mussels, leak less DNA into the preservative and therefore remain undetected or produce less sequences than expected due to their biomass (Carew et al. 2018; Zizka et al. 2018; Martins et al. 2020). Likewise, terrestrial arthropods that have evolved hard exoskeletons to conserve water have also been shown to leak less DNA into the preservative (Marquina et al. 2019). However, in some cases, it may be important and necessary to keep vouchers for morphological identification as references for recorded biodiversity. In such instances, where homogenization of the collected samples is not possible, non-destructive DNA extraction of bulk samples using extraction buffer and the enzyme Proteinase K can be a viable alternative (Nielsen et al. 2019), as has been shown for freshwater macroinvertebrates (Carew et al. 2018). It is also worth noting that different types of DNA-extractions from homogenized samples can generate different results, especially if there are PCR-inhibiting substances originating from plants or sediments in the sample (Majaneva et al. 2018).\n\nSensitivity of the PCR DNA polymerases (Nichols et al. 2018; Taberlet et al. 2018), primer and marker choice (Elbrecht et al. 2018; Elbrecht & Leese 2017; Elbrecht et al. 2016), and even sequencing instrument (Braukmann et al. 2019) can influence the results of DNA metabarcoding. Studies have shown that metabarcoding cannot deliver precise specimen counts, due to variation in specimen biomass (Elbrecht et al. 2017) as well as inefficiencies in copying of the barcoding gene for some species (Elbrecht and Leese, 2015; Krehenwinkel et al., 2017; Piñol et al., 2015). There are, however, indications that read counts correlate to some extent with biomass (Elbrecht and Leese, 2017; Piñol et al. 2019; Schenk et al., 2020). Thus, read abundance can be used to compare the relative species abundance between samples, but this approach is currently not able to quantify the absolute abundance.\n\nMany bioinformatic pipelines are used in analysing the output from high throughput sequencing instruments, both with regard to quality filtering and taxonomic assignments (e.g. Boyer et al. 2016; Callahan et al. 2019). Regardless of the methods chosen, it is important to have knowledge of your input data as naïve settings are likely to produce erroneous results (Majaneva et al. 2015).\n\n4.1 Sample collection\n\n4.1.1 Sample collection protocols\n\nIceland – Samples were collected from five streams which are monitored annually. Two of the streams are situated in the west of Iceland and three in the north-east. One to three sites were sampled within each stream, in total eight sites. For the sites in the north-east, a protocol that was established in the mid-1990s was followed, where rocks were removed from the streambed and rinsed to collect macroinvertebrates. The material retained was sieved through 125 µm sieve and preserved in 96% ethanol. For the sites in the west of Iceland, Surber samples were collected and processed in the same way as the stone samples. The ethanol was decanted within 24 h and replaced with fresh 96% ethanol. Samples were sorted and macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest taxonomic unit feasible using a dissecting microscope. For each site, four to five replicate samples were processed.\n\nDenmark – A total of 60 samples were collected from streams covering gradients in stream size and level of anthropogenic impact. Sampling was undertaken according to the guidelines of the Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI; Skriver, Friberg & Kirkegaard, 2000). The sampling procedure is standardized with a total of 12 samples collected along three transects (ca. 10 m apart) across the stream. Samples were taken using a hand net (mesh size 0.5 mm) supplemented with a 5-min qualitative sample taken by hand-picking from submerged stones and large woody debris. The samples were preserved in 80% ethanol and the sample was shaken to speed up the displacement of water with ethanol within the animals. The ethanol was decanted and replaced with 96% ethanol usually within two to three hours after sampling but always within a maximum of 24 hours. The samples were sorted in the lab using x 10 magnification and macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest taxonomic unit feasible.\n\nSweden – Fifty benthic invertebrate samples were collected from littoral habitats of lakes (n=25 lakes) and riffle habitats of streams (n=25 streams) in the autumn (October–November) of 2017 according to Swedish guidelines. All lakes and streams are part of the national monitoring program. The study sites were chosen to reflect gradients in latitude and taxon diversity. Five kick samples were taken using a hand net (mesh size 0.5 mm) from hard-bottom (stony) substratum. Each replicate sample consisted of disturbing the substratum along a 1-m segment of lakeshore or stream reach for 20 s or 60 s, respectively. Samples were immediately preserved in 99% ethanol. On arrival to the lab (within 24-48 h) the ethanol was decanted and replaced with 99% ethanol. The samples were processed in the laboratory by sorting using x 10 magnification and macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest taxonomic unit feasible (usually species) and counted using light and dissecting microscopes.\n\nNorway – 139 benthic invertebrate samples were collected from littoral habitats/outlets of lakes (n=31 lakes) and riffle habitats of streams (n=36 streams) in the autumn (September–October) of 2018. From some of the lakes, additional samples were taken in early summer (May–June). All lakes and streams are part of the national monitoring program. The study objects were chosen to reflect different lake- and river types (covering gradients in latitude, alkalinity and humic content) and taxon diversity. For lakes one sample was taken from the lakeshore and one from the outlet. For rivers, a single sample was taken. All samples were taken using a hand net (mesh size 0.25 mm) from hard-bottom (stony) substratum by disturbing the substratum along a segment of lakeshore or stream reach for 60 s (kick-sampling). Samples were immediately preserved in 96% ethanol. The ethanol was decanted and replaced with 96% ethanol within 24 h, either in the field or upon arrival to the lab. The samples were processed in the laboratory by sorting using x 10 magnification and macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest taxonomic unit feasible (usually species) and counted using light and dissecting microscopes.\n\nFinland – A total of 48 benthic samples were collected in the autumn (September–November) of 2017, consisting of 23 stream samples, 9 lake profundal samples and 16 lake littoral samples. Sampling sites, distributed across most of Finland, are part of the national monitoring program for effects of forestry and agricultural practices (Aroviita et al. 2014) and sampling followed national WFD biomonitoring guidelines. Each sample was a composite of 6 subsamples taken at each stream or site lake. In streams and lake littorals each subsample was taken with a hand net by moving upstream or upwind for 1m and for a duration of 30 s (littorals 20 s) while disturbing the substrate by kicking. For lake littoral habitats, depending on the presence of stony littoral habitat in each lake, sampling was conducted in two lakes at one littoral site (six subsamples from each site), in five lakes at two littoral sites (three subsamples from both sites) and in nine lakes at three littoral sites (two subsamples from each site). For lake profundal habitats, the lake sample consisted of a total of six Ekman grab subsamples taken at a depth of at least 90% of the lake’s maximum depth. Benthic samples were sieved using a 0.5 mm mesh and preserved in the field using denatured 96% ethanol. The ethanol was decanted and replaced with 96% ethanol within 24 h. The samples were sorted in the laboratory with no magnification and the macroinvertebrates were identified and counted according to the national requirements mostly to species or genus (excluding identification of dipteran families and Oligochaeta) using light and dissecting microscopes.\n\n4.1.2 Sample preparation\n\nAfter morphological identification all samples were returned to vials, stored in 96% ethanol and sent to NTNU for laboratory processing. Samples were stored at 6°C on arrival to the laboratory until processed for DNA extraction explained in the next session.\n\n6.3 Issues encountered in the metabarcoding process\n\nWe successfully metabarcoded 289 of 297 samples (97.3%) and in most samples more taxa were detected using metabarcoding than with the morphology-based determinations. However, we also encountered major obstacles and challenges that resulted in substantial delays of the project (see figure 4).\n\nOn the laboratory side, sample processing was carried out initially by a team that received the laboratory protocols, but that did not have extensive experience in the particular protocol. This led to errors in the bioinformatic sample assignment step (demultiplexing), where samples are separated based on the attached unique molecular indices. The position of each sample was planned using a spreadsheet, and on the first plate two rows were exchanged due to a copy paste error. This error was detected and mitigated retrospectively, due to use of negative controls on the plate and due to the fact that each sample was processed with three replicates distributed across 12 plates. Despite this, the possibility remains that other samples on plate 1 were erroneously put in the wrong wells or that there was true cross-contamination between samples, which was indicated by a negative control that contained many reads. Ideally, the entire DNA extraction and metabarcoding of the whole plate would have been repeated. The issue of sample cross-contamination could have been spotted when running a DNA gel of the DNA extraction or measuring the DNA concentration with digital methods. This is a critical step to assess DNA quality and quantity before DNA is used in PCR. In this step, a simple DNA gel picture or detection of a significant amount of DNA would have revealed that one of the negative controls contained a substantial amount of DNA, which would have allowed us to repeat the whole extraction. However, as gel pictures of the DNA extracts where only taken retrospectively, this mistake was not detected early in the process.\n\nTo minimize the risk of such errors early in the process chain, we recommend rigorous quality assurance training for the team carrying out sample processing, as well as taking photographs of the samples as they are placed in the extraction plates. This way, if for example a negative control is found to be positive, the photographic documentation can be checked to see if samples were misplaced. Also, the use of a dedicated laboratory information system (LIMS) is advised, as it allows tracking of samples through the entire work process. Further, the use of QR-code labeled vials and sampling tubes in combination with barcode scanners for sample intake, as well as automated processing of samples using robotics, would significantly reduce the risk of human error. Regardless of whether robotics is used, rigorous training and auditing of personnel along with detailed written process documentation is paramount to reduce errors at this stage of the process. Similar certification exists for medical and commercial laboratories and adoption of such routines for environmental metabarcoding are possible.\n\nWe assessed DNA quality as well as PCR success using gel pictures. For DNA extractions we repeated this procedure independently twice but results of these assessments varied substantially in some cases. The DNA gel images were only consistent for 55% of the samples among the three replicates available for each sample. This might indicate issues with preparing the DNA extraction replicates from the ground tissue powder. However, it is also very likely that there are inconsistencies between the different gel documentation systems used by both institutes, especially because these laboratories only performed analyses within a very short time frame (3 days) and because initial attempts with library preparation failed by another lab. It should be pointed out that all these methods are usually very reliable. While gel pictures are sufficient for assessing PCR success, we would recommend using digital gel imaging methods (e.g. Fragment Analyzer, Agilent Technologies). Digital gel imaging allows to precisely assess and quantify DNA concentration and degradation by measuring DNA fragment length. This allows for a more precise identification of samples which have been affected by DNA degradation. DNA degradation can occur both when there are a lot of specimens in a sample, or when the ethanol is not replaced with fresh ethanol after collecting the samples. In both cases, the water in the specimens and detritus can dilute the 96% ethanol to 80–70% at which point DNA degradation can already occur. This can be problematic, as it might degrade the DNA from some or even all specimens in the sample, greatly reducing the chance for good amplification of the barcoding fragment in PCR or even leading to complete PCR failure. This might have been the case for some samples from Denmark, where over 30% of replicates had DNA quality issues. As a consequence, six samples did not work at all, with 14 additional samples showing dropouts in at least one replicate. A follow up study will determine if the Danish samples were collected according to protocol, or contained an unusual number of specimens, in which case the sampling protocol might need to be adapted by increasing the amount of ethanol or replacing the ethanol with fresh ethanol more than once.\n\nAn additional challenge that led to substantial delays was that the initial metabarcoding laboratory work carried out according to the protocol in appendix 3 did not result in a library that could be sequenced successfully. While we obtained sequences, over 90% of them where primer dimers, and only a small proportion were target sequences. These issues are puzzling, since the metabarcoding laboratory process partly functioned, as a small amount of sequences generated were of the expected length and assigned to macroinvertebrates. Additionally, the primer dimers were not visible in gel pictures or using digital gel imaging methods, but flooded the sequencing run regardless even after repeated cleanups as well as gel checks of that library after repeating the failed run. We were not able to determine or resolve the cause of these issues. Therefore, DNA samples were shipped to a different laboratory, where DNA was quantified and the whole procedure started again with small modification, i.e. the BF3 primer instead of BF2, as well as a touchdown PCR, even though touch down PCRs are usually not recommended for metabarcoding (Aylagas et al. 2016). We have to stress here, that the issues we encountered with sequencing are extremely rare (it has never happened in two of the three labs involved despite having processed over 100 sequencing runs) and could have been caused by a handling issue when preparing the DNA libraries.\n\nBioinformatic processing (Figure 3) went well but did encountered a few logistical challenges. Data delivery and processing formed a bottleneck, as a server was not available at that time. Thus, processing of the almost 600 million sequences in this data set had to be carried out on a 2019 MacBook pro, which took about one week. Offline data processing of 160 GB compressed data on separate devices is prone to device error or malfunction and also presents challenges to long term data storage and to data up and download. Such issues can be circumvented with properly implemented scalable cloud computing solutions which are currently not readily available. Demonstrating the need for more streamlined workflows was also exemplified that even the external sequencing provider had issues delivering the data online and chose to send the sequenced raw data per mail on an unencrypted hard drive. While this is not only ineffective, it also poses data security risks and the challenge to reupload data back onto a server, whereas server to server transfers are usually fast. Thus, we recommend implementing an appropriate cloud-based bioinformatics pipeline, with dedicated long-term raw data storage strategies. For this project we decided to use the NCBI short read archive for long term storage of the data, which allows us to also make the data publicly accessible (SRA accession PRJNA662474). However, not all of the raw data could be uploaded, some files were delivered containing errors in the sequence order, and thus could not be accepted by SRA. The error in the raw data delivery format was due to an error on the sequencing provider site and should have been checked upon data delivery to us. We are currently working with the sequencing provider to resolve this issue. While there were some issues with the company that did the sequencing, we still recommend using an external sequencing provider. This is because sequencing technology is rapidly improving and evolving, and thus inhouse sequencing and investment costs of up to 1 million USD of sequencing machines which are likely obsolete within years are not economically feasible unless there is a huge throughput. Outsourcing of the sequencing to commercial providers is more cost effective, even though part of the process is not fully controllable.\n\nFurther bioinformatics challenges were encountered when assigning taxonomy to the resulting DNA sequences after bioinformatic processing. For the COI marker used there are two main sequence repositories for reference sequences, BOLD and NCBI. Since we are dealing with millions of reference sequences, generating a reliable reference database is not trivial. Some of the sequences uploaded to these databases might be annotated incorrectly, may contain errors or are from a misidentified organism, thus linking to the wrong taxon. An additional complication is that both databases might use synonymous species names and differ in taxonomy. With BOLD there is an additional complication, as around 50% of the data are not publicly accessible, and only can be queried using the website API. Even publicly available BOLD data cannot be easily downloaded. This complicates the data base situation and given the limited available time towards the end of this project taxonomy was assigned using the BOLD website. This has the advantage that it allowed us access private data as well. However, for long-term monitoring, we strongly recommend that Nordic/nation-wide reference databases for macroinvertebrates are generated using strictly quality controlled public data from BOLD and NCBI, as well as specimens collected in each country. In fact, at least Denmark and Norway have already started this process of generating national, curated reference databases (for Denmark see https://dnamark.ku.dk, for Norway see discussion in Åström et al. 2020). An accurate and complete reference database will be key to a future monitoring program and needs to be thoroughly checked for errors and missing taxa with the aid of taxonomic experts. The web based BOLD reference database we used does not fully meet these quality criteria.\n\n6.4. Assessing the applicability of the DNA-based identification\n\nFor the assessment of the applicability of any novel method, a number of criteria need to be investigated: method reliability, environmental impact, added value, limitations and required expertise as well as costs (Mack et al. 2020). DNA-metabarcoding scored “high applicability” in a recent assessment of metabarcoding viability in the context of Baltic marine monitoring (Mack et al. 2020) but this assessment did not entail a large-scale validation exercise like the one conducted in this study. Hering et al. (2018) discuss the implementation options of molecular methods in the context of the WFD in detail, dividing the different pathways into option 1 and option 2. In option 1, the “DNA-based identiﬁcation” simply replaces traditional identification and the molecular information obtained is reverted to the Linnean taxa system. With DNA-based identiﬁcation, current indices and the subsequent assessment systems could remain the same or adoption would necessitate only minor modifications. The advantages of this approach would primarily be in increased comparability, processing speed and cost efficiency. However, option 2 would make full use of the molecular data and allow for analyses utilizing taxonomy-free approaches and also functional gene assessments that could provide previously unattainable information on trends in response to single and multiple stressors not previously encountered (Beermann et al. 2018, Beermann et al. 2021, Cordier et al. 2020). While this prospect is tempting, option 2 is not likely to become a reality in the next 10 years. However, a switch from traditional identification to DNA-based identification and its extensions (e.g. the inclusion of taxa typically not identified in routine bioassessments, such as Chironomidae) it is possible and would have the potential to provide a much more accurate estimate of environmental conditions and enable the gradual progression towards option 2.\n\nReliability of a method is an important deciding factor when deciding on its implementation into routine use. Mack et al. (2020) rated reliability of novel methods as ‘high’, either when the resulting data had an improved reliability or when it was comparable but resulted in substantially greater amounts of data. With the design we used, a fully independent assessment of method reliability is not possible. This is because the samples used in metabarcoding were first subjected to manual morphological identification, which could have led to additional degradation of the DNA in samples during the identification process due to diluting the samples with water to avoid excessive vaporization of alcohol during manual keying. Our results strongly suggest that for most samples suffering from degradation, this occurred before samples went through the genetic pipeline, thereby likely reducing the reliability of the DNA-based identification. Levels of degraded samples in Denmark were much higher than what could be tolerated during routine operation. However, as the trends for sample degradation were not equally distributed among countries, we are confident that the poor preservation of DNA in the Danish samples was mainly due to an easily avoidable procedural error before sequencing, given that most other samples had good DNA quality. Similarly, the fact that much of the laboratory work had to be repeated in this study may seem to indicate that metabarcoding is not ready for routine use yet. Indeed, it shows that the method can be sensitive to protocol violations. However, we argue that rather than pointing to a lack of reliability, the observed shortcomings emphasize the need for internationally agreed upon laboratory protocols and staff training. Laboratory automation as performed in this project is one step into this direction. With the Biomek FxP (Fig. 5) the over 1000 individual reactions were processed successfully within only three working days.\n\nWork on developing existing European standards for sample preservation during macroinvertebrate sampling should also be revisited or the drafting of novel guidance considered. Nordic efforts for developing such guidance and providing training to laboratory and field personnel in the context of national reference laboratories must clearly be a future priority.\n\nThe need to assess the viability of molecular methods for routine use in identification is not unique to the use of metabarcoding in aquatic biomonitoring. In Norway, an extensive pilot study tested various practical methodologies for implementing a general insect monitoring scheme (Åström et al. 2020). The pilot study used flying insects collected by Malaise traps, later to be identified by DNA-metabarcoding in the lab and validated by traditional morphological identification. In addition to measuring the insect communities and comparing DNA metabarcoding techniques with morphological identifications, the report contains a cost-benefit analysis of a potential future general, nation-wide insect monitoring scheme.\n\nAndersen, J.H., Aroviita, J., Carstensen, J., Friberg, N., Johnson, R.K., Kauppila, P., Lindegarth, M., Murray, C. & Norling, K.
