        "text": "Mesoionic imidazolium compounds and derivatives for combating animal pests\n\nThe present invention relates to insecticidal substituted imidazolium compounds and/or to the compositions comprising such compounds for combating invertebrate pests. The invention also relates to pesticidal methods, to uses and to applications of substituted imidazolium compounds as described in the present invention and the stereoisomers, salts, tautomers and N-oxides thereof as well as compositions comprising them.\n\nInvertebrate pests and in particular insects, arthropods and nematodes destroy growing and harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures, thereby causing large economic loss to the food supply and to property. While a large number of pesticidal agents are known, due to the ability of target pests to develop resistance to said agents, there is an ongoing need for new agents for combating invertebrate pests such as insects, arachnids and nematodes. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds having a good pesticidal activity and showing a broad activity spectrum against a large number of different invertebrate pests, especially against difficult to control insects, arachnids and nematodes.\n\nIt has been found that these objectives can be achieved by compounds of the general formula (I), as defined below, including their stereoisomers, their salts, in particular their agriculturally or veterinary acceptable salts, their tautomers and their N-oxides.\n\nTherefore, in a first aspect the present invention provides compounds of formula (I)\n\nwherein\n\nW is O, and\n\nT is R5, OR6, -N(R7)(R8) or -N(R7a)-N(R7)(R8);\n\nor\n\nW is S, and\n\nT is -N(R7)(R8) or -N(R7a)-N(R7)(R8);\n\nR1 is N02, CN d-Cs-alkyl,
