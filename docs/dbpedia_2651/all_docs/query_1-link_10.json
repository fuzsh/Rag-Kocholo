This Scientific Opinion covers plant health risks posed by plants of Acer palmatum imported from the United Kingdom (UK) as: (a) 1‐ to 2‐year‐old bare root plants for planting and (b) 1‐ to 7‐year‐old plants in pots, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by the UK. All pests associated with the commodity were evaluated against specific criteria for their relevance for this opinion. Six EU quarantine pests and four pests not regulated in the EU fulfilled all relevant criteria and were selected for further evaluation. For these pests, the risk mitigation measures implemented in the technical dossier from the UK were evaluated taking into account the possible limiting factors. For the selected pests an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. The degree of pest freedom varies among the pests evaluated, with Meloidogyne mali or M. fallax being the pest most frequently expected on the imported plants. The expert knowledge elicitation indicated with 95% certainty that 9,792 or more plants in pots per 10,000 will be free from Meloidogyne mali or M. fallax.\n\nKeywords: maple, European Union, commodity risk assessment, plant health, plant pest\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1. Background and Terms of Reference as provided by European Commission\n\n1.1.1. Background\n\nThe Plant Health Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 1 , on the protective measures against pests of plants, has been applied from December 2019. Provisions within the above Regulation are in place for the listing of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ (Article 42) on the basis of a preliminary assessment, and to be followed by a commodity risk assessment. A list of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ has been published in Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 2 . Scientific opinions are therefore needed to support the European Commission and the Member States in the work connected to Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, as stipulated in the terms of reference.\n\n1.1.2. Terms of Reference\n\nIn view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 3 , the Commission asks EFSA to provide scientific opinions in the field of plant health.\n\nIn particular, EFSA is expected to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in the relevant Implementing Act as ‘High risk plants, plant products and other objects’. Article 42, paragraphs 4 and 5, establishes that a risk assessment is needed as a follow‐up to evaluate whether the commodities will remain prohibited, removed from the list and additional measures will be applied or removed from the list without any additional measures. This task is expected to be on‐going, with a regular flow of dossiers being sent by the applicant required for the risk assessment.\n\nTherefore, to facilitate the correct handling of the dossiers and the acquisition of the required data for the commodity risk assessment, a format for the submission of the required data for each dossier is needed.\n\nFurthermore, a standard methodology for the performance of ‘commodity risk assessment’ based on the work already done by Member States and other international organizations needs to be set.\n\nIn view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, the Commission asks EFSA to provide scientific opinion in the field of plant health for Acer palmatum from the UK taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical dossier provided by the UK.\n\n1.2. Interpretation of the Terms of Reference\n\nThe EFSA Panel on Plant Health (hereafter referred to as ‘the Panel') was requested to conduct a commodity risk assessment of Acer palmatum from the UK following the Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high‐risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019). taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by the UK.\n\nIn accordance with the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 5(4) of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in conjunction with Annex 2 to that Protocol, for the purposes of this Opinion, references to the United Kingdom do not include Northern Ireland.\n\nThe EU quarantine pests that are regulated as a group in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 4 were considered and evaluated separately at species level.\n\nAnnex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 lists certain pests as non‐European populations or isolates or species. These pests are regulated quarantine pests. Consequently, the respective European populations, or isolates, or species are non‐regulated pests.\n\nAnnex VII of the same Regulation, in certain cases (e.g. point 32) makes reference to the following countries that are excluded from the obligation to comply with specific import requirements for those non‐European populations, or isolates, or species: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canary Islands, Faeroe Islands, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Russia (only the following parts: Central Federal District (Tsentralny federalny okrug), Northwestern Federal District (SeveroZapadny federalny okrug), Southern Federal District (Yuzhny federalny okrug), North Caucasian Federal District (Severo‐Kavkazsky federalny okrug) and Volga Federal District (Privolzhsky federalny okrug), San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Türkiye, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland 5 )).\n\nConsequently, for those countries,\n\nany pests identified, which are listed as non‐ European species in Annex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 should be investigated as any other non‐regulated pest.\n\nany pest found in a European country that belongs to the same denomination as the pests listed as non‐European populations or isolates in Annex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, should be considered as European populations or isolates and should not be considered in the assessment of those countries.\n\nPests listed as ‘Regulated Non‐Quarantine Pest' (RNQP) in Annex IV of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 and deregulated pests (i.e. pest which were listed as quarantine pests in the Council Directive 2000/29/EC and were deregulated by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072) were not considered for further evaluation. In case a pest is at the same time regulated as a RNQP and as a Protected Zone Quarantine pest, in this Opinion it should be evaluated as Quarantine pest.\n\nIn its evaluation the Panel:\n\nChecked whether the provided information in the technical dossier (hereafter referred to as ‘the Dossier’) provided by the applicant (United Kingdom, Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs – hereafter referred to as ‘DEFRA’) was sufficient to conduct a commodity risk assessment. When necessary, additional information was requested to the applicant.\n\nSelected the relevant Union quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (as specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, hereafter referred to as ‘EU quarantine pests’) and other relevant pests present in the UK and associated with the commodity.\n\nDid not assess the effectiveness of measures for Union quarantine pests for which specific measures are in place for the import of the commodity from the UK in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 and/or in the relevant legislative texts for emergency measures and if the specific country is in the scope of those emergency measures. The assessment was restricted to whether or not the applicant country implements those measures.\n\nAssessed the effectiveness of the measures described in the Dossier for those Union quarantine pests for which no specific measures are in place for the importation of the commodity from the UK and other relevant pests present in the UK and associated with the commodity.\n\nRisk management decisions are not within EFSA's remit. Therefore, the Panel provided a rating based on expert judgement regarding the likelihood of pest freedom for each relevant pest given the risk mitigation measures proposed by DEFRA of the UK.\n\n2. Data and Methodologies\n\n2.1. Data provided by DEFRA of the UK\n\nThe Panel considered all the data and information (hereafter called ‘the Dossier’) provided by DEFRA of the UK in May 2022 including the additional information provided by DEFRA of the UK in January 2023, after EFSA's request. The Dossier is managed by EFSA.\n\nThe structure and overview of the Dossier is shown in Table . The number of the relevant section is indicated in the Opinion when referring to a specific part of the Dossier.\n\nTable 1\n\nDossier SectionOverview of contentsFilename1.0Technical dossierAcer palmatum commodity information FINAL draft2.0Pest listAcer_pest_list_final_checked3.0Additional information: answersAcer palmatum additional information 3 Nov 20224.0Additional information: distribution of Acer palmatum plantsAcer_palmatum_distribution (1)5.0Additional information: pest detailsAcer_palmatum‐EFSA_pest_detail_request_Jan236.0Additional information: producers sample product listA.platanoides_A.palmatum_producers_sample_product_list\n\nThe data and supporting information provided by DEFRA of the UK formed the basis of the commodity risk assessment. Table shows the main data sources used by DEFRA of the UK to compile the Dossier (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 2.0).\n\n2.2. Literature searches performed by EFSA\n\nLiterature searches in different databases were undertaken by EFSA to complete a list of pests potentially associated with A. palmatum. The following searches were combined: (i) a general search to identify pests reported on A. palmatum and Acer species reported as Acer sp. and Acer spp. in the databases, (ii) a search to identify any EU quarantine pest reported on Acer as genus and subsequently (iii) a tailored search to identify whether the above pests are present or not in the UK. The searches were run between July and August 2022. No language, date or document type restrictions were applied in the search strategy.\n\nThe Panel used the databases indicated in Table to compile the list of pests associated with the tree species listed above. As for Web of Science, the literature search was performed using a specific, ad hoc established search string (see Appendix B). The string was run in ‘All Databases’ with no range limits for time or language filters. This is further explained in Section 2.3.2.\n\nAdditional searches, limited to retrieve documents, were run when developing the Opinion. The available scientific information, including previous EFSA opinions on the relevant pests and diseases (see pest data sheets in Appendix A) and the relevant literature and legislation (e.g. Regulation (EU) 2016/2031; Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) 2018/2019; (EU) 2018/2018 and (EU) 2019/2072) were taken into account.\n\n2.3. Methodology\n\nWhen developing the Opinion, the Panel followed the EFSA Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high‐risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019).\n\nIn the first step, pests potentially associated with the commodity in the country of origin (EU‐quarantine pests and other pests) that may require risk mitigation measures are identified. The EU non‐quarantine pests not known to occur in the EU were selected based on evidence of their potential impact in the EU. After the first step, all the relevant pests that may need risk mitigation measures were identified.\n\nIn the second step, the implemented risk mitigation measures for each relevant pest were evaluated.\n\nA conclusion on the pest freedom status of the commodity for each of the relevant pests was determined and uncertainties identified using expert judgements.\n\nPest freedom was assessed by estimating the number of infested/infected units out of 10,000 exported units. Further details on the methodology used to estimate the likelihood of pest freedom are provided in Section 2.3.4.\n\n2.3.1. Commodity data\n\nBased on the information provided by DEFRA of the UK the characteristics of the commodity were summarised.\n\n2.3.2. Identification of pests potentially associated with the commodity\n\nTo evaluate the pest risk associated with the importation of the commodity from the UK, a pest list was compiled. The pest list is a compilation of all identified plant pests reported as associated with A. palmatum, Acer sp., Acer spp. and all EU quarantine pests reported as associated with Acer as a genus based on information provided in the Dossier Sections 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 and on searches performed by the Panel. The search strategy and search syntax were adapted to each of the databases listed in Table , according to the options and functionalities of the different databases and CABI keyword thesaurus.\n\nThe scientific names of the host plants (i.e. Acer, Acer sp., Acer spp., A. palmatum) were used when searching in the EPPO Global database and CABI Crop Protection Compendium. The same strategy was applied to the other databases excluding EUROPHYT and Web of Science.\n\nEUROPHYT was investigated by searching for the interceptions associated with A. palmatum imported from the whole world from 1995 to May 2020 and TRACES‐NT from May 2020 to 22 December 2022, respectively. For the pests selected for further evaluation, a search in the EUROPHYT and/or TRACES‐NT was performed for the years between 1995 and December 2022 for the interceptions from the whole world, at species level.\n\nThe search strategy used for Web of Science Databases was designed combining English common names for pests and diseases, terms describing symptoms of plant diseases and the scientific and English common names of the commodity and excluding pests which were identified using searches in other databases. The established search strings are detailed in Appendix B and they were run on 29 June and 01 July 2022.\n\nThe titles and abstracts of the scientific papers retrieved were screened and the pests associated with Acer sp., Acer spp. and A. palmatum were included in the pest list. The pest list was eventually further compiled with other relevant information (e.g. EPPO code per pest, taxonomic information, categorisation, distribution) useful for the selection of the pests relevant for the purposes of this Opinion.\n\nThe compiled pest list (see Microsoft Excel® in Appendix F) includes all identified pests that use as hosts Acer sp., Acer spp. and A. palmatum.\n\nThe evaluation of the compiled pest list was done in two steps: first, the relevance of the EU‐quarantine pests was evaluated (Section 4.1); second, the relevance of any other plant pest was evaluated (Section 4.2).\n\nPests for which limited information was available on one or more criteria used to identify them as relevant for this Opinion, e.g. on potential impact, are listed in Appendix E (List of pests that can potentially cause an effect not further assessed).\n\n2.3.3. Listing and evaluation of risk mitigation measures\n\nAll implemented risk mitigation measures were listed and evaluated. When evaluating the likelihood of pest freedom of the commodity, the following types of potential infection/infestation sources for Acer palmatum in export nursery were considered (see also Figure ):\n\npest entry from surrounding areas,\n\npest entry with new plants/seeds,\n\npest spread within the nursery.\n\nThe risk mitigation measures proposed by DEFRA of the UK were evaluated with expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) according to the Guidance on uncertainty analysis in scientific assessment (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018).\n\nInformation on the biology, likelihood of entry of the pest to the export nursery, of its spread inside the nursery and the effect of measures on the specific pests were summarised in data sheets of pests selected for further evaluation (see Appendix A).\n\n2.3.4. Expert knowledge elicitation\n\nTo estimate the pest freedom of the commodity an EKE was performed following EFSA guidance (Annex B.8 of EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018). The specific question for EKE was: ‘Taking into account (i) the risk mitigation measures in place in the nurseries and (ii) other relevant information, how many of 10,000 individual plants will be infested with the relevant pest when arriving in the EU?’\n\nThe commodity is described in the Dossier as 1‐ to 2‐year‐old single bare root plants and single plants in pots of 1–7 years. The Panel considers it as most likely that 1‐ to 2‐year‐old bare root plants are not transported as single plants and that they are combined in bundles as described for other Acer species from the UK. Therefore, the risk assessment considers bundles of 5–15 bare root 1‐ to 2‐year‐old plants and 1‐ to 7‐year‐old single plants in pots.\n\nThe following reasoning is given for considering bundles of 1‐ to 2‐year‐old trees:\n\nThere is no quantitative information available regarding clustering of plants during production\n\nPlants are grouped in bundles of 5, 10 or 15 after sorting\n\nFor the pests under consideration, a cross‐contamination during transport is possible\n\nThe following reasoning is given for considering single plants (in pots):\n\nThe inspections before export are targeted on individual plants.\n\nIt is assumed that the product will be distributed in the EU as individual plants to the consumer.\n\nThe EKE question was common to all pests for which the pest freedom of the commodity was estimated.\n\nThe uncertainties associated with the EKE were taken into account and quantified in the probability distribution applying the semi‐formal method described in section 3.5.2 of the EFSA‐PLH Guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018). Finally, the results were reported in terms of the likelihood of pest freedom. The lower 5% percentile of the uncertainty distribution reflects the opinion that pest freedom is with 95% certainty above this limit.\n\n3. Commodity data\n\n3.1. Description of the commodity\n\nThe commodities of A. palmatum (common name: Japanese maple; family: Sapindaceae) to be imported from the UK to the EU are bare root plants and rooted plants in pots (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.0). According to the Dossier Section 3.0, none of the nurseries expected to export to the EU are using grafting in the production of A. palmatum.\n\nThe commodities are as follows:\n\n–\n\nBare root plants: the age of plants is between 1 and 2 years. The diameter is between 3–5 mm for 1‐year‐old plants and 4–7 mm for 2‐year‐old plants. The height is 15–40 cm for 1‐year‐old plants and 20–50 cm for 2‐year‐old plants. Bare root plants are intended as dormant but they may have some leaves at the time of export, particularly when exported in November (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\n–\n\nRooted plants in pots: the age of plants is between 1 and 7 years (Dossier Section 1.0). The diameter is between 3–10 mm for 1‐ to 2‐year‐old plants and 30–40 mm for 7‐year‐old plant. The plants in pots may be exported with leaves, depending on the timing of the export (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nSmall plants can be considered as seedlings.\n\nIn the original Dossier (Dossier Section 1.0), there was specified another commodity to be exported to the EU: semi mature specimen trees 18 years old (occasionally up to 25 years old) in containers. However, in the Dossier Section 3.0 the applicant decided to withdraw the application of this commodity. Therefore, the PLH Panel did not assess this commodity in this Opinion.\n\nThe growing media is virgin peat or peat‐free compost (a mixture of coir, tree bark, wood fibre, etc.) (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.0) complying with the requirements for growing media as specified in the Annex VII of the Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072.\n\nAccording to ISPM 36 (FAO, 2019), the commodities can be classified as ‘bare root plants’ and ‘rooted plants in pots’.\n\nAccording to the Dossier Section 1.0, the trade volume is up to 500 rooted plants in pots per year. The trade of these plants will mainly be to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There is no information regarding the bare root plants.\n\nAccording to the Dossier Section 1.0, plants are supplied direct to professional operators and traders. Uses may include propagation, growing‐on, onward trading or direct sales to final consumers but will generally fall into two categories:\n\n–\n\nTree production and further growing‐on by professional operators, or\n\n–\n\nDirect sales to final users as ornamental plants.\n\n3.2. Description of the production areas\n\nThere are three known nurseries in the UK that are producing A. palmatum plants for the export to the EU (Dossier Section 3.0). The nurseries are shown in Figure .\n\nAcer species are grown in Great Britain in line with the Plant Health (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 20206 6 and the Plant Health (Phytosanitary Conditions) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 7 . These regulations are broadly similar to EU phytosanitary regulation (Dossier Section 1.0). Producers do not set aside separate areas for export production. All plants within the UK nurseries are grown under the same phytosanitary measures, meeting the requirements of the UK Plant Passporting regime (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nSize of the nurseries is between 8 and 150 ha (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThe nurseries also grow other plant species as shown in the Appendix C. The minimum and maximum proportion of A. palmatum compared to the other plant species grown in the nurseries is between 0.2% and 1%. The majority of the nurseries also produce plants for the local market, and there is no distancing between production areas for the export and the local market (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThe nurseries are kept clear of non‐cultivated herbaceous plants. In access areas, non‐cultivated herbaceous plants are kept to a minimum and only exist at nursery boundaries. Non‐cultivated herbaceous plants grow on less than 1% of the nursery area. The predominant species is rye grass (Lolium sp.). Other identified species include dandelions (Taraxacum officinale), hairy bittercress (Cardamine hirsuta), common daisy (Bellis perennis), creeping cinquefoil (Potentilla reptans) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides non‐scripta). These are all extremely low in number (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThere are hedges surrounding the export nurseries made up of a range of species including hazel (Corylus avellana), yew (Taxus baccata), holly (Ilex), ivy (Hedera), alder (Alnus glutinosa), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), hawthorn (Crataegus), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and leylandii (Cupressus × leylandii) (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThe closest Acer plants grown in the surroundings are 20 m away from the nurseries (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nNurseries are predominately situated in the rural areas. The surrounding land would tend to be arable farmland with some pasture for animals and small areas of woodland. Hedges are often used to define field boundaries and grown along roadsides (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nArable crops within a radius of 2 km from the nurseries are rotated in line with good farming practice and could include oilseed rape (Brassica napus), wheat (Triticum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), turnips (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and maize (Zea mays) (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nPastures are present within a radius of 2 km from the nurseries and are predominantly ryegrass (Lolium sp.) (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nWoodland is present within a radius of 2 km from the nurseries. The closest one is 50 m away. Woodlands tend to be a standard UK mixed woodland, with a range of UK native trees such as oak (Quercus robur), pine (Pinus), poplar (Populus), ash (Fraxinus), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), holly (Ilex), Norway maple (Acer platanoides) and field maple (Acer campestre). The nearest woodland in one of the nurseries borders the boundary fence (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nIt is not possible to identify what plant species are growing within the gardens of private dwellings within a radius of 2 km from the nurseries (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nOther plants likely to be present in the surroundings of the nurseries (within 2 km radius) are: Abies spp., Aesculus spp., Allium porrum, Alnus spp., Beta vulgaris, Betula spp., Camellia spp., Capsicum annuum, Castanea spp., Daucus carota, Fagus spp., Hordeum vugare, Juglans regia, Lolium multiflorum, Magnolia spp., Malus spp., Morus spp., Picea spp., Pinus spp., Populus spp., Prunus spp., Quercus spp., Rhododendron spp., Rosa spp., Salix spp., Sambucus spp., Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum tuberosum, Sorbus spp., Syringa spp., Ulmus spp., Viburnum spp. and Wisteria spp. (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nBased on the global Köppen–Geiger climate zone classification (Kottek et al., 2006), the climate of the production areas of A. palmatum in the UK is classified as Cfb, i.e. main climate (C): warm temperate; precipitation (f): fully humid; temperature (b): warm summer.\n\n3.3. Production and handling processes\n\n3.3.1. Source of planting material\n\nThe starting material of the commodities are seeds (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nSeeds purchased in the UK are certified under The Forest Reproductive Material (Great Britain) Regulations 2002. Some plants may be obtained from the EU (mostly the Netherlands) and New Zealand. These are the only two sources of the plants obtained from abroad (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nNone of the nurseries expected to export to the EU produce plants from grafting, they use only seed and seedlings, therefore there are no mother plants of A. palmatum present in the nurseries (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\n3.3.2. Production cycle\n\nPlants are either grown under protection (smaller plants) or outdoors in containers (larger plants) (Dossier Sections 1.0).\n\nUp to a maximum of 60% of A. palmatum plants are grown under protection. These plants are maintained in plastic polytunnels or in glasshouses which typically consist of a metal or wood frame construction and glass panels. As the plants are intended for outdoor cultivation it is normally only certain growth stages that are maintained under protection, such as young plants/seedlings where there is an increased vulnerability due to climatic conditions including frost (Dossier Section 3.0). The PLH Panel assumes that potted plants could be cultivated for the whole period in pots or grown in the field and then transplanted in pots at a later stage. In this last case it is assumed that the roots will be washed before potting and soil removed as required by the legislation for a commodity to be exported to the EU.\n\nBare root plants are planted from late autumn until early spring (November to March). Rooted plants in pots can be planted at any time of year, though winter is most common (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nAccording to the Dossier Section 1.0, rooted plants in pots can be moved at any point in the year to fulfil consumer demand. These will likely be destined for garden centre trade rather than nurseries. There is no information regarding the bare root plants.\n\nThe growing media is virgin peat or peat‐free compost. This compost is heat‐treated by commercial suppliers during production to eliminate pests and diseases. It is supplied in sealed bulk bags or shrink‐wrapped bales and stored off the ground on pallets, these are free from contamination. Where delivered in bulk, compost is kept in a dedicated bunker, either indoors or covered by tarpaulin outdoors and with no risk of contamination with soil or other material (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nThe irrigation is done on the need basis and could be overhead, sub irrigation or drip irrigation. Water used for irrigation can be drawn from several sources, the mains supply, bore holes or from rainwater collection or watercourses (Dossier Section 3.0). Additional information on water used for irrigation is provided in the Appendix D. Regardless of the source of the water used to irrigate, none of the nurseries have experienced the introduction of a pest/disease as a result of contamination of the water supply (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nGrowers are required to assess water sources, irrigation and drainage systems used in the plant production for the potential to harbour and transmit plant pests. Water is routinely sampled and sent for analysis. No quarantine pests have been found (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nGrowers must assess weeds and volunteer plants for the potential to host and transmit plant pests and have an appropriate programme of weed management in place on the nursery (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nGeneral hygiene measures are undertaken as part of routine nursery production, including disinfection of tools and equipment between batches/lots and different plant species (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.0). The tools are dipped and wiped with a clean cloth between trees to reduce the risk of virus and bacterial transfer between subjects. There are various disinfectants available, with Virkon S (active substance: potassium peroxymonosulfate and sodium chloride) being a common example (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nGrowers keep records to allow traceability for all plant material handled. These records must allow a consignment or consignment in transit to be traced back to the original source, as well as forward to identify all trade customers to which those plants have been supplied (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\n3.3.3. Pest monitoring during production\n\nAll producers are registered as professional operators with the UK Competent Authority via the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) for England and Wales, or with the Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA) for Scotland, and are authorised to issue the UK plant passports, verifying they meet the required national sanitary standards. The Competent Authority inspect crops at least once a year to check they meet the standards set out in the guides. Assessments are normally made based on visual examinations, but samples may be taken for laboratory analysis to get a definitive diagnosis (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nThe Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI), part of APHA, execute plant health policy, except forestry matters, in England and Wales under a Memorandum of Understanding with DEFRA and with the Welsh Government. In Scotland, this role is carried out by inspectors in the Rural Payments and Inspections Division and the Horticulture and Marketing Unit, in SASA. PHSI and Scottish inspectors carry out import, export, monitoring and survey inspections, issue phytosanitary certificates and oversee import controls, issuing of plant passports and eradication campaigns (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nThe sanitary status of production areas is controlled by the producers as part of these schemes, as well as via official inspections by APHA Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors (PHSI) or with SASA (Scotland) (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nAll producers are subject to regular inspections by plant health inspectors as part of either Plant Passporting audits, or a programme of general surveillance of all registered producers (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nThe UK plant health inspectors monitor for pests and diseases during crop certification and passporting inspections. In addition, the PHSI (in England and Wales) carry out a programme of Quarantine Surveillance in registered premises, inspecting plants grown and moving within the UK market. Similar arrangements operate in Scotland (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nAccording to the Dossier Section 1.0 the objective of the quarantine surveillance is to ensure that:\n\n–\n\nthe plant passport regime is being operated effectively.\n\n–\n\nquarantine organisms are not spread on plants and plant produce which are not subject to plant passporting.\n\n–\n\nthe UK plant health authorities have early warning of any new threat from a previously unknown pest or disease which has become established within the UK.\n\n–\n\nplant health authorities can take informed decisions on the scope and operation of the plant passport regime.\n\nAccording to the Dossier Section 1.0 the quarantine surveillance programme centres on a risk‐based selection of premises to visit, based on size, types of plants grown, source of plants and the producer's track record of pest and disease issues. Guidance on visit frequency is given to inspectors to ensure that those sites which present the greatest risk are visited more frequently than those of lower risk. The risk category assigned to a premise determines the frequency of visit:\n\n–\n\nvery high risk (multiple visits per year);\n\n–\n\nhigh risk (two/three visits per year);\n\n–\n\nmedium risk (annual visit);\n\n–\n\nlow risk (once every 3 years).\n\nInspections are targeted both at the plants or products which present the greatest risk, and also a wider range of plants and plant products which are monitored for more general risks, including those highly polyphagous pests whose range may be unknown or still increasing. The UK inspectors receive comprehensive training on the full range of symptoms caused by pests and diseases, to allow them to detect any new and emerging risks, and during a visit to a nursery they are free to inspect any plants on that nursery. Samples of pests and plants showing any suspicious symptoms are routinely sent to the laboratory for testing (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nIn the last 3 years there has been a substantial level of inspection of registered Acer producers, both in support of the Plant Passporting scheme (checks are consistent with EU legislation, with a minimum of one a year for authorised operators) and as part of the Quarantine Surveillance programme (Great Britain uses the same framework for its surveillance programme as the EU) (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nPlant material is regularly monitored for plant health issues. Pest monitoring is carried out by trained nursery staff via crop walking and records kept of this monitoring. Qualified agronomists also undertake crop walks to verify the producer's assessments. Curative or preventative actions are implemented together with an assessment of phytosanitary risk. Unless a pest can be immediately and definitively identified as non‐quarantine, growers are required to treat it as a suspect quarantine pest and notify the competent authority (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nThe crops are inspected visually on a regular basis by competent nursery staff as part of the growing process. All plants are also carefully inspected by nurseries on arrival and dispatch for any plant health issues (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nIt is a legal requirement under the UK Plant Health law for any person in charge of a premise to notify the Competent Authority of the presence or suspected presence, of a plant pest. The requirement is not limited to those organisms listed in the UK legislation but is also required for any organism not normally present in the UK which is likely to be injurious to plants (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nThe nurseries follow the Plant Health Management Standard issued by the Plant Healthy Certification Scheme of which DEFRA, the Royal Horticultural Society and others contribute to via The Plant Health Alliance Steering Group (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThe UK surveillance is based on visual inspection with samples taken from symptomatic material, and where appropriate, samples taken from asymptomatic material (e.g. plants, tubers, soil, watercourses). According to the Dossier Section 3.0, for sites with the likelihood of multiple pest and host combinations (e.g. ornamental and retail sites) standard methods are used for site selection and visit frequency, whereby clients are assessed taking into account business activity, size of business and source material, so for example a large propagator using third country material receives 10 visits per year whilst a small retailer selling locally sourced material is visited once every second year. Where pest specific guidelines are absent Inspectors select sufficient plants to give a 95% probability of detecting symptoms randomly distributed on 1.5% of plants in a batch/consignment. For inspections of single hosts, possibly with multiple pests, survey site selection is often directed to specific locations identified by survey planners, for example 0.5% of ware potato production land is annually sampled for potato cyst nematode (PCN) with farms randomly selected and sampled at a rate of 50 cores per hectare (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nDuring production, in addition to the general health monitoring of the plants by the nurseries, official growing season inspections are undertaken by the UK Plant Health Service at an appropriate time, taking into consideration factors such as the likelihood of pest presence and growth stage of the crop. Where appropriate this could include sampling and laboratory analysis. Official sampling and analysis could also be undertaken nearer to the point of export depending on the type of analysis and the import requirements of the country being exported to. Samples are generally taken on a representative sample of plants, in some cases however where the consignment size is quite small all plants are sampled. Magnification equipment is provided to all inspectors as part of their standard equipment and is used during inspections when appropriate (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nAll residues or waste materials shall be assessed for the potential to host, harbour and transmit pests (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nIncoming plant material and other goods such as packaging material and growing media, that have the potential to be infected or harbour pests, are checked on arrival. Growers have procedures in place to quarantine any suspect plant material and to report findings to the authorities (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\n3.3.4. Pest management during production\n\nCrop protection is achieved using a combination of measures including approved plant protection products, biological control, or physical measures. Plant protection products are only used when necessary and records of all plant protection treatments are kept (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nPest and disease pressure varies from season to season. Product application takes place only when required and depends on situation (disease pressure, growth stage, etc., and environmental factors) at that time. Subject to this variation in pest pressure, in some seasons few, if any, pesticides are applied; in others it is sometimes necessary to apply preventative and/or control applications of pesticides. In many circumstances also, biological control is used to control outbreaks, rather than using chemical treatments (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nExamples of typical treatments used against mildew, Botrytis, spider mites, aphids and thrips are detailed in the Dossier Section 3. These would be applied at the manufacturers recommended rate and intervals (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThere are no specific measures/treatments against the soil pests. However, containerised plants are grown in trays on top of protective plastic membranes to prevent contact with soil. Membranes are regularly refreshed when needed. Alternatively, plants may be grown on raised galvanised steel benches stood on gravel as a barrier between the soil and bench feet and/or concreted surfaces (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nPost‐harvest and through the autumn and winter, nursery management is centred on pest and disease prevention and maintaining good levels of nursery hygiene. Leaves, pruning residues and weeds are all removed from the nursery to reduce the number of overwintering sites for pests and diseases (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\n3.3.5. Inspections before export\n\nThe UK NPPO carries out inspections and testing where required by the country of destination's plant health legislation, to ensure all requirements are fulfilled and a valid phytosanitary certificate with the correct additional declarations is issued (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nSeparate to any official inspection, plant material is checked by growers for plant health issues prior to dispatch (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nA final pre‐export inspection is undertaken as part of the process of issuing a phytosanitary certificate. These inspections are generally undertaken as near to the time of export as possible, usually within 1–2 days, and not more than 2 weeks before export. Phytosanitary certificates are only issued if the commodity meets the required plant health standards after inspection and/or testing according to appropriate official procedures (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThe protocol for plants infested by pests during inspections before export is to treat the plants, if they are on site for a sufficient period of time, or to destroy any plants infested by pests otherwise. All other host plants in the nursery would be treated. The phytosanitary certificate for export will not be issued until the UK Plant Health inspectors confirm that the plants are free from pests (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\n3.3.6. Export procedure\n\nBare root plants are lifted, washed free from soil with a low‐pressure washer in the outdoors nursery area away from packing/cold store area (Dosser Section 3.0).\n\nThe maximum time from the harvesting of bare root plants to the export is up to 5 months. Plants are stored in cold store or heeled into soil (but before export they would be washed to ensure freedom from soil). Most plants for export would be kept in cold store (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThe preparation of the commodities for export is carried out inside the nurseries in a closed environment, e.g. packing shed (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nPlants are sent by lorry (size dependant on load quantity). Rooted plants in pots are mainly exported between September and May, although these can be moved at any point in the year to fulfil consumer demand. Sensitive plants are occasionally transported by temperature‐controlled lorry if weather conditions during transit are likely to be very cold (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nBare root plants are placed in bundles, wrapped in polythene and packed and distributed on ISPM 15 certified wooden pallets or metal pallets. Alternatively, they may be placed in pallets which are then wrapped in polythene. Small volume orders may be packed in waxed cardboard cartons or polythene bags and dispatched via courier (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nRooted plants in pots are transported on Danish trolleys for smaller containers or certified pallets or individually in pots for larger containers (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\n4. Identification of pests potentially associated with the commodity\n\nThe search for potential pests associated with the commodity rendered 1,698 species (see Microsoft Excel® file in Appendix F).\n\n4.1. Selection of relevant EU‐quarantine pests associated with the commodity\n\nThe EU listing of union quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072) is based on assessments concluding that the pests can enter, establish, spread and have potential impact in the EU.\n\n36 EU‐quarantine species that are reported to use commodity as a host plant were evaluated (Table ) for their relevance of being included in this Opinion.\n\nTable 4\n\nNo.Pest name according to EU legislation (a) EPPO CodeGroupPest present in the UK Acer confirmed as a host (reference)Pest can be associated with the commodityPest relevant for the Opinion1 Anisandrus maiche as Scolytinae spp. (non‐European)ANIDMAInsectsNo Acer barbinerve, A. mandshuricum, A. pictum var. mono (EPPO, online)Not assessedNo2 Anoplophora chinensis ANOLCNInsectsNo Acer campestre, A. palmatum, A. platanoides, A. pseudoplatanus (EPPO, online)Not assessedNo3 Anoplophora glabripennis ANOLGLInsectsNo Acer platanoides, A. pseudoplatanus (EPPO, online)Not assessedNo4a Bemisia tabaci (non‐European populations)BEMITAInsectsNo Acer palmatum (CABI, online)Not assessedNo4b Bemisia tabaci (European populations)BEMITAInsectsYes Acer palmatum (CABI, online)YesYes5 Candidatus Phytoplasma fragariae related strains (YN‐169, YN‐10G)PHYPFGPhytoplasmasNo Acer (EPPO, online)Not assessedNo6 Choristoneura conflictana ARCHCOInsectsNo Acer negundo (Robinson et al., online)Not assessedNo7 Choristoneura parallela CHONPAInsectsNo Acer rubrum (Robinson et al., online)Not assessedNo8 Choristoneura rosaceana CHONROInsectsNo Acer palmatum (EPPO, online)Not assessedNo9 Cnestus mutilatus as Scolytinae spp. (non‐European)XYLSMUInsectsNo Acer palmatum (EPPO, online)Not assessed10 Corthylus punctatissimus as Scolytinae spp. (non‐European)CORHPUInsectsNo Acer platanoides (CABI, online)Not assessedNo11 Cryphonectria parasitica ENDOPAFungiYes Acer palmatum (Farr and Rossman, online)YesYes12 Davidsoniella virescens CERAVIFungiNo Acer campestre (CABI, online)Not assessedNo13 Diabrotica undecimpunctata undecimpunctata DIABUNInsectsNo Acer (EPPO, online)Not assessedNo14 Entoleuca mammata HYPOMAFungiYes Acer (Hawksworth, 1972)YesYes15 Euwallacea fornicatus sensu lato (including: Euwallacea fornicatus sensu stricto, Euwallacea fornicatior, Euwallacea kuroshio and Euwallacea perbrevis)XYLBFO EUWAWH EUWAFO EUWAKU EUWAPEInsectsNo Acer palmatum (EPPO, online)Not assessedNo16 Euwallacea interjectus as Scolytinae spp. (non‐European)XYLBINInsectsNo Acer negundo (EPPO, 2020)Not assessedNo17 Euwallacea validus as Scolytinae spp. (non‐European)XYLBVAInsectsNo Acer pensylvanicum (EPPO, 2020)Not assessedNo18 Longidorus diadecturus LONGDINematodesNo Acer (Xu and Zhao, 2019)Not assessedNo19 Lopholeucaspis japonica LOPLJAInsectsNo Acer palmatum (CABI, online;

Selection of other relevant pests (non‐regulated in the EU) associated with the commodity\n\nThe information provided by the UK, integrated with the search performed by EFSA, was evaluated to assess whether there are other potentially relevant pests potentially associated with the commodity species present in the country of export. For these potential pests that are non‐regulated in the EU, pest risk assessment information on the probability of entry, establishment, spread and impact is usually lacking. Therefore, these pests were also evaluated to determine their relevance for this Opinion based on evidence that:\n\nthe pest is present in the UK;\n\nthe pest is (i) absent or (ii) has a limited distribution in the EU;\n\nthe commodity is a host of the pest;\n\none or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity;\n\nthe pest may have an impact in the EU.\n\nFor non‐regulated species with a limited distribution (i.e. present in one or a few EU MSs) and fulfilling the other criteria (i.e. c, d and e), either one of the following conditions should be additionally fulfilled for the pest to be further evaluated:\n\nofficial phytosanitary measures have been adopted in at least one EU MS;\n\nany other reason justified by the working group (e.g. recent evidence of presence).\n\nPests that fulfilled the above listed criteria were selected for further evaluation.\n\nBased on the information collected, 1,656 potential pests known to be associated with the species commodity were evaluated for their relevance to this Opinion. Species were excluded from further evaluation when at least one of the conditions listed above (a‐e) was not met. Details can be found in the Appendix F (Microsoft Excel® file). Of the evaluated EU non‐quarantine pests, four pests (Coniella castaneicola, Eulecanium excrescens, Meloidogyne mali and Takahashia japonica) were selected for further evaluation because they met all of the selection criteria. More information on these four pests can be found in the pest datasheets (Appendix A).\n\n4.3. Overview of interceptions\n\nData on the interception of harmful organisms on plants of A. palmatum can provide information on some of the organisms that can be present on A. palmatum despite the current measures taken. According to EUROPHYT, online (accessed on 22 December 2022) and TRACES‐NT, online (accessed on 22 December 2022), there were no interceptions of plants for planting of A. palmatum from the UK destined to the EU Member States due to the presence of harmful organisms between the years 1995 and 22 December 2022.\n\nThere were 58 interceptions of plants for planting of A. palmatum from China, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Korea and South Korea destined to the EU Member States due to the presence of harmful organisms (Anoplophora chinensis, Anoplophora sp., Cnidocampa flavescens, Helicotylenchus sp., Meloidogyne sp., Neofusicoccum sp., Paratylenchus sp., Pratylenchus penetrans, Pratylenchus sp., Tylenchorhynchus sp., Xiphinema americanum and Xiphinema sp.) between the years 1995 and 22 December 2022 (EUROPHYT, online).\n\n4.4. List of potential pests not further assessed\n\nFrom the list of pests not selected for further evaluation, the Panel highlighted eight species (see Appendix E) for which currently available evidence provides no reason to select these species for further evaluation in this Opinion. A specific justification of the inclusion in this list is provided for each species in Appendix E.\n\n4.5. Summary of pests selected for further evaluation\n\nThe 10 pests satisfying all the relevant criteria listed above in the Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are included in Table . The effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures applied to the commodity was evaluated for these selected pests.\n\nTable 5\n\nNumberCurrent scientific nameEPPO codeName used in the EU legislationTaxonomic informationGroupRegulatory status1 Bemisia tabaci BEMITA Bemisia tabaci Genn.

Risk mitigation measures\n\nFor the selected pests (Table ), the Panel evaluated the likelihood that it could be present in the A. palmatum nurseries by evaluating the possibility that the commodity in the export nurseries is infested either by:\n\nintroduction of the pest from the environment surrounding the nursery;\n\nintroduction of the pest with new plants/seeds;\n\nspread of the pest within the nursery.\n\nThe information used in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures is summarised in pest data sheets (see Appendix A).\n\n5.1. Risk mitigation measures applied in the UK\n\nWith the information provided by the UK (Dossier Sections 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0), the Panel summarised the risk mitigation measures (see Table ) that are implemented in the production nursery.\n\nTable 6\n\nNumberRisk mitigation measureImplementation in the UK1Registration of production sitesAll producers are registered as professional operators with the UK Competent Authority via APHA for England and Wales or SASA for Scotland, and are authorised to issue the UK plant passports, verifying they meet the required national sanitary standards (Dossier Section 1.0).2Physical separationProducers do not set aside separate areas for export production. All plants within the UK nurseries are grown under the same phytosanitary measures, meeting the requirements of the UK Plant Passporting regime (Dossier Section 1.0).3Certified plant materialSeeds purchased in the UK are certified under The Forest Reproductive Material (Great Britain) Regulations 2002. Some plants may be obtained from the EU (mostly the Netherlands) and New Zealand. These are the only two sources of the plants obtained from abroad (Dossier Section 3.0).4Growing mediaThe growing media is virgin peat or peat‐free compost. This compost is heat‐treated by commercial suppliers during production to eliminate pests and diseases. It is supplied in sealed bulk bags or shrink‐wrapped bales and stored off the ground on pallets, these are free from contamination. Where delivered in bulk, compost is kept in a dedicated bunker, either indoors or covered by tarpaulin outdoors and with no risk of contamination with soil or other material (Dossier Section 1.0).5Surveillance, monitoring and samplingFor additional information see Section 3.3.3 Pest monitoring during production.6Hygiene measures\n\nGrowers must assess weeds and volunteer plants for the potential to host and transmit plant pests and have an appropriate programme of weed management in place on the nursery (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nGeneral hygiene measures are undertaken as part of routine nursery production, including disinfection of tools and equipment between batches/lots and different plant species (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.0). The tools are dipped and wiped with a clean cloth between trees to reduce the risk of virus and bacterial transfer between subjects. There are various disinfectants available, with Virkon S being a common example (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\n7Removal of infested plant materialPost‐harvest and through the autumn and winter, nursery management is centred on pest and disease prevention and maintaining good levels of nursery hygiene. Leaves, pruning and weeds are all removed from the nursery to reduce the number of over wintering sites for pests and diseases (Dossier Section 1.0).8Irrigation waterWater for irrigation is routinely sampled and sent for analysis (Dossier Section 1.0).9Application of pest control products\n\nCrop protection is achieved using a combination of measures including approved plant protection products, biological control or physical measures. Plant protection products are only used when necessary and records of all plant protection treatments are kept (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nExamples of typical treatments used against mildew, Botrytis, spider mites, aphids and thrips are detailed in the Dossier Section 3. These would be applied at the manufacturers recommended rate and intervals (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\n10Measures against soil pestsThere are no specific measures/treatments against the soil pests. However, containerised plants are grown in trays on top of protective plastic membranes to prevent contact with soil. Membranes are regularly refreshed when needed. Alternatively, plants may be grown on raised galvanised steel benches stood on gravel as a barrier between the soil and bench feet and/or concreted surfaces (Dossier Section 3.0).11Inspections and management of plants before export\n\nThe UK NPPO carries out inspections and testing where required by the country of destination's plant health legislation, to ensure all requirements are fulfilled and a valid phytosanitary certificate with the correct additional declarations is issued (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nSeparate to any official inspection, plant material is checked by growers for plant health issues prior to dispatch (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\nA final pre‐export inspection is undertaken as part of the process of issuing a phytosanitary certificate. These inspections are generally undertaken as near to the time of export as possible, usually within 1–2 days, and not more than 2 weeks before export. Phytosanitary certificates are only issued if the commodity meets the required plant health standards after inspection and/or testing according to appropriate official procedures (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\nThe protocol for plants infested by pests during inspections before export is to treat the plants, if they are on site for a sufficient period of time, or to destroy any plants infested by pests otherwise. All other host plants in the nursery would be treated. The phytosanitary certificate for export will not be issued until the UK Plant Health inspectors confirm that the plants are free from pests (Dossier Section 3.0).\n\n12Separation during transport to the destination\n\nBare root plants are placed in bundles, wrapped in polythene and packed and distributed on ISPM 15 certified wooden pallets, or metal pallets. Alternatively, they may be placed in pallets which are then wrapped in polythene. Small volume orders may be packed in waxed cardboard cartons or polythene bags and dispatched via courier (Dossier Sections 1.0 and 3.0).\n\nRooted plants in pots are transported on Danish trolleys for smaller containers, or certified pallets, or individually in pots for larger containers (Dossier Section 1.0).\n\n5.2. Evaluation of the current measures for the selected relevant pests including uncertainties\n\nFor each evaluated pest, the relevant risk mitigation measures acting on the pest were identified. Any limiting factors on the effectiveness of the measures were documented.\n\nAll the relevant information including the related uncertainties deriving from the limiting factors used in the evaluation are summarised in a pest data sheet provided in Appendix A. Based on this information, for each selected relevant pest, an expert judgement is given for the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures and their combination acting on the pest.\n\nAn overview of the evaluation of each relevant pest is given in the sections below (Sections 5.2.1–5.2.9). The outcome of the EKE regarding pest freedom after the evaluation of the currently proposed risk mitigation measures is summarised in Section 5.2.10\n\n5.2.1.
