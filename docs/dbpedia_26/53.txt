The Yowani Choctaw had emigrated into Texas in the mid-eighteenth century, assimilating into the larger Caddo cultural and political body. Lino Sánchez y Tapía created this illustration to accompany naturalist Jean Luis Berlandier’s, and army officers’ Manuel de Pier y Terán and his (likely) relative José María Sánchez y Tapía’s, contributions to Mexico’s 1828 Comisión de Límites survey of Texas. Yowanis lived near the headwaters of the Sabine, eventually relocating to Indian Country (Oklahoma).
