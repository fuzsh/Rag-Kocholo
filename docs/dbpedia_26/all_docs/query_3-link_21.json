C. was Chickasaw.\n\nW. C. Thompson is Notable.\n\nWilliam C. Thompson was a leader of the Mount Tabor Indian Community in Texas. During the Dawes Commission enrollment period in Indian Territory, he spearheaded an effort to gain citizenship of his family and other Texas Choctaws as Citizens by blood of the Choctaw Nation. He led a group from Mount Tabor who moved from Texas to Indian Territory in 1887 to reside in the Chickasaw Nation. These Texas or Yowani Choctaw were stricken from the rolls in 1906 because the Choctaw Advisory Board opposed inclusion of the Texas Choctaw as well as the Jena Choctaws in Louisiana. Thompson filed suit and his case eventually went to the United States Supreme Court to be decided. In 1909 Thompson and about 70 other Texas Choctaws ultimately had their status restored as Citizens by Blood in the Choctaw Nation. Among other honors, Thompson was elected Mayor of Marlow, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory in 1901, and was a celebrated leader among the Texas Choctaws.\n\nWilliam C. Thompson was born 6 Feb 1839 to William Wayne Thompson and Elizabeth Ann (Mangum) Thompson. It is believed he was born at Fort Towson, Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory, yet many sources give Mississippi.[1]\n\nWilliam's parents died when he was quite small and he and his older brother Arthur James Thompson were cared for by their paternal grandmother Margaret (McCoy) Thompson in the Chickasaw Nation near Fort Washita. They lived with her until their maternal grandfather William Mangum came to take them back to Simpson County, Mississippi.[2][3] The boys grew up in this household until coming of age and serving in the American Civil War.[1]\n\nWilliam enlisted in the Confederate Army and achieved the rank of Captain during the American Civil War. During the conflict he was seriously injured and captured by Union forces, and cared for at a Union Hospital. During this time he was awarded the rank brevet Lieutenant Colonel.[4]\n\nAfter the war he made his way to Texas to work for a distant cousin at a lumber mill. He married Sarah S. Estes 29 May 1867 near Trinity, Texas, United States.[1]\n\nChildren of Sarah and WIlliam:\n\nMary Marie Thompson 1868–?[5][6]\n\nArthur Marcellus Thompson 1869–1926[5][6]\n\nWilliam Clyde Thompson 1875–1921[6]\n\nThe family moved to the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory in 1887[7] and William resided there his remaining years.[8] It was in Indian Territory that he battled to have his family included on the Choctaw Nation rolls. His efforts were successful and citizenship was restored in 1909.[9]\n\nWilliam died 6 Oct 1912 in Marlow, Stephens, Oklahoma, United States and is buried at the Marlow Cemetery.[10]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nAn earlier version of this profile was moved to a separate page to retain the lengthy text for those who wish to review Thompson's role in the Mount Tabor and Choctaw Enrollment events. See William C Thompson Research\n\nHis middle name has been given as \"Clyde\" or alternately as \"Candace\" in military records.\n\nReading\n\nJ. C.
