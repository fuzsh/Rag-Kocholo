He was a full blood Choctaw Indian. He may have h ad additional wives and children not listed. It also appears that Neshoba may have been a Yowani Choctaw, as son of his descendants were known to be in Texas before 1836. This is further reflected in how the Texas Choctaws (Yowani) approached enrollment on the Final Rolls of the Choctaw Nation, choosing William C. Thompson and John Thurston Thompson as representatives of the whole group. Both of these individuals were Yowani descendants and lineal descendants of Atahobia (same person as Attobah listed below), with William C., also being descended from Nashoba.\n\nThe First Choctaw Trading House was located at a place the Spanish named in honor of of the Spanish Governor of W. Florida, Estevan Miro. The trading house was moved in the year 1815 inside the Choctaw Nation confines, near a place called James Springs, which had belonged to Adam James. According to the records, Mr. Adam James was paid the sum of $120.00 for the land.\n\nDEBTS DUE THE UNITED STATES FROM THE CHOCTAW TRADING HOUSE OCTOBER 1, 1822\n\nBelow you find the names, and the \"credit rating\" of the persons name mentioned who owed money at The Choctaw Trading House.\n\nNAME AMNT OWED CREDIT RATING\n\nADAM JAMES 597.00 NOT GOOD CHOCTAW AGENCY 513.35 GOOD\n\nATTOBAH 50.68 GOOD\n\nSAMUEL MCGEE 7.25 DOUBTFUL GEN'L HUMMINGBIRD 78.49 DOUBTFUL JOSEPH C.

He also believed he had up to three wives. One source the late William C. Thompson IV, believed that one was white.\n\nHe has never been identified as Samuel \"Nashoba\" Jones. However in a Department of the Interior letter dated March 3, 1905 he is listed as \"known by the names Samuel or Jim Jones or Nashoba\". No other place have I seen this reference to him. I cannot pull up the letter on line at ([3]) to verify this is the actual letter I got the info from. The name Samuel \"Nashoba\" is for reference purposes as full blood Choctaws prior to 1840 generally did not use English names. JCT 9/20/11\n\nTestimony from Winburn Jones ( William C. Thompson et al vs. Choctaw Nation), states he also used the name Jim Jones. This corresponds to other full blood descendants of him that also refer to him as Jim Jones.[4]\n\nSources\n\n↑ FAMILY TIES by J. C.
