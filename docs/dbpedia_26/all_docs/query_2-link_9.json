        "text": "AIS 120: INDIANS OF THE AMERICAS\n\nCASE STUDY: NORTH AMERICA: CHOCTAW\n\nORIGINS\n\nThe Choctaw have been in the Southeastern part of North America for thousands of years with some traditions even hinting at the acknowledgement of Pleistocene megafauna, \"they saw the mighty beasts of the forest, whose tread shook the earth.\" However, it is not clear as to whether the Choctaw were derived from a number of cultures that went from Archaic (11,000-3,000 years ago) - Mississippian Cultures (1200-200 years ago). Choctaw tradition holds that the modern confederacy was derived from various Mississippian traditions moving into the Mississippi area 500 years ago (AD 1500), including people from Plaquemine in Louisiana and Moundville in Alabama. The legend of the modern confederacy focuses on the sacred Nanih Waiya temple mound in Winston Co., Mississippi.\n\nLegend of Nanih Waiya: The Choctaws a great many winters ago commenced moving from the country where they then lived, which was a great distance to the west of the great river and the mountains of snow, and they were a great many years on their way. A great medicine man led them the whole way, by going before with a red pole, which he stuck in the ground every night where they encamped. This pole was every morning found leaning to the east, and he told them that they must continue to travel to the east until the pole would stand upright in their encampment, and that there the Great Spirit had directed that they should live. (George Catlin; Smithsonian Report)\n\nTRADITIONAL CULTURE\n\nThe Choctaw Legend of Nanih Waiya provides clues to the culture changes that occurred in the Southeast from the 1500s to the 1700s. The Mississippian city states and original confederacies based on ancient trade alliances reflected in the archaeological evidence from Cahokia, Spiro and Moundsville; were severely disrupted most likely by Spanish traders and invasions bringing smallpox. As these vibrant civilizations were reduced in size and power, the survivors dispersed. In the 1600s three or more disparate groups with related languages came into south central Mississippi to an ancient city state known later as Nanih Waiya. One group came from the west from Louisiana or even as far as Spiro in Oklahoma they became the Okla Fayla. A second group came from the northeast and may have been remnants of Moundsville in Alabama. A third group came from the south and were the Okla Hannali. They were from a number of city states, possibly including some of the Biloxi people. These diverse groups became the Choctaw Confederacy and rose to power militarily and economically through astute diplomacy by 1700. Culture groups are always in flux and to label a traditional culture and lifestyle is arbitrary. Since we have incomplete evidence of the identity of earlier antecedents of the culture of the Choctaw Confederacy the date ~1700 is what is deemed as the traditional culture. The Choctaw experience more changes as the Anglo Americans increased in power and removed most of the Choctaw to Oklahoma.\n\nChoctaw <1700\n\nLanguage Macro-Algonkian (Algic) Muskogean Settlement North America: Eastern Woodlands/ Southeast sc Mississippi; se Alabama Economics CBS agriculture\n\nTrade alliances SE and Plains\n\nFortified Villages, Dance and Council houses, Stickball courts\n\nwild plants, fishing and shellfish, melons, sunflower, pecan, walnut/hunting deer, bear, birds and bison\n\nWinter house- doomed waddle and daub semi subterranean; summer house open gabled roof\n\nSocial Organization Family and lineage: matrilineal, mo bro\n\nClan\n\nMoiety; Exogamous/ ritual reciprocity\n\nInhoklasha: elder brother (white peace)\n\nImoklaha; younger brother (red war)\n\nTowns/Council Elders counselors war leaders\n\nConfederacy: Western/Eastern/Southern Division of labor: Men: hunting, trade and war and Women: farming, household/ goods\n\nMale Rank: Grand Chiefs; Elders; Warriors, Uninitiated\n\nFemale Rank: lineage, trade and artisan\n\nTown hierarchy: Head/Assistant; War Captains/Lt; District emissary; Council: Men and Women World View Myths and legends: Emergence\n\nBeliefs: Upper/Middle/Lower Sun/Fire life giver\n\nRitual: Green Corn Dance; Eagle Dance; Feasts; Ball Games and Night Dances\n\nPractitioners:' Doctors': Prophets for war and ball games; diviners, herbalists Expressed Form Tattoos and cranial deformation, cotton and mulberry fiber textiles; pottery (coiled),\n\nbasketry, shell, copper, monolithic maces Various games: chunkey, stick ball (like lacrosse/two rackets), jacks and gambling games\n\nStick ball was most elaborate (called 'little war') between towns w/ diviners\n\nCONTACT\n\nThe Choctaw numbered around 20-30,000 in the confederacy of 1680-1750. As stated earlier they were made up of various chiefdoms derived from Mississippian cultures that declined due to indirect and direct contact with early Europeans along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico's coastal waters and Spanish missions in Florida. Hernando De Soto's 1540 expedition made their way into Choctaw country ( at least of antecedent groups) and were routed at the Battle of Mabilia. However, De Soto left lethal diseases in his wake. Throughout most of the 18th century the Choctaw Confederacy entered into trade alliances with the British, Spanish and French. They warred with various factions of the Natchez, Chickasaw and Creeks and in 1748 became engulfed in civil war between pro-French and pro-British factions of the Choctaw Confederacy.\n\n[edit]\n\nMany Choctaw aided the Americans in the Revolutionary War, which resulted in recognition in treaties between 1786-1789 led by the prophet chief Taboca. The Choctaw were eloquent speakers and conducted treaties in high formal style to the dismay of impatient and arrogant Europeans/Americans. In many cases the Choctaw were able to negotiate treaties in which the Americans were clueless or misunderstood the ramifications of the terms. The Choctaw supported the Americans and Gen. Andrew Jackson against the British in the War of 1812 under the leadership of Pushmataha. Pushmataha convinced Choctaw factions not to side with Tecumseh and the British in 1811. However, Andrew Jackson would go on to betray the Choctaw through a series of treaties and eventual removal. In the Treaty of Doak's Stand with the U.S. reduced traditional Choctaw land in Mississippi by 5 million acres but in exchange for more than 13 million acres west of the Mississippi River. Jackson was impatient with Pushmataha and there was somewhat a battle of wills as expressed in this exchange:\n\nGen. Jackson put on all his dignity and thus addressed the chief: \"I wish you to understand that I am Andrew Jackson, and, by the Eternal, you shall sign that treaty as I have prepared it.\" The mighty Choctaw Chief was not disconcerted by this haughty address, and springing suddenly to his feet, and imitating the manner of his opponent, replied, \"I know very well who you are, but I wish you to understand that I am Pushmataha, head chief of the Choctaws; and, by the Eternal, I will not sign that treaty.\"\n\nThe treaty itself is more conciliatory as seen in this sample:\n\n� WHEREAS it is an important object with the President of the United States, to promote the civilization of the Choctaw Indians, by the establishment of schools amongst them; and to perpetuate them as a nation, by exchanging, for a small part of their land here, a country beyond the Mississippi River, where all, who live by hunting and will not work, may be collected and settled together. And whereas it is desirable to the state of Mississippi, to obtain a small part of the land belonging to said nation; for the mutual accommodation of the parties, and for securing the happiness and protection of the whole Choctaw nation, as well as preserving that harmony and friendship which so happily subsists between them and the United States, James Monroe, President of the United States of America, by Andrew Jackson, of the State of Tennessee, Major General in the Army of the United States, and General Thomas Hinds, of the State of Mississippi, Commissioners Plenipotentiary of the United States, on the one part, and the Mingoes, Head Men, and Warriors, of the Choctaw nation, in full Council assembled, on the other part,: have freely and voluntarily entered into the following articles, viz ... �\n\n�-Treaty of Doak's Stand, 1820\n\nWithin four years local Mississippians encroached on remaining Choctaw land and new settlers also encroached on land in the newly exchanged land west of the Mississippi river. Since the U.S. did not honor the treaty, it was necessary for Pushmataha to travel to Washington D.C. in 1824 to see Pres. Monroe, but he became sick and died on 24 December, 1824. He was given full military honors as a Brigadier General of the U.S. Army and buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington D.C.\n\nLater, when Jackson became president, he passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Choctaw ceded the last of their land in Mississippi in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit. The Choctaw that remained in Mississippi were given citizenship. Between 1831-1833 many Choctaw went to Oklahoma, but about 5,000 stayed in the state of Mississippi. The treaty even provided that a Choctaw would be put in the U.S. House of Representatives. However, local agents and whites in Mississippi would not accept the new citizens. They blocked their citizenship rights, harassed the Choctaw, burned homes, destroyed livestock and murdered leaders. The Mississippi Choctaw slowly conceded to the jealousy and racism by removing to the Oklahoma group with less than 2,000 staying in Mississippi.\n\nIn the American Civil War the cause of the Confederacy was supported by Choctaw, Creeks and Cherokee but the confederacy refused them pay and equipment. By 1863 they were desperate and the First Choctaw Battalion under Gen. Arnold Spann honored itself with heroic rescue efforts of a Confederate train wreck at Chunky Creek, MS. After the Civil War the Mississippi Choctaw were largely ignored. In 1906 the governments of the Oklahoma Five Civilized Tribes, including the Choctaw were abolished."
