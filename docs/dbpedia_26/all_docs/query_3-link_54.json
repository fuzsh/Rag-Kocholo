        "text": "Despite being identified as Apalachee by Europeans, Native Americans at Mission San Joseph de Escambe (1741-1761) produced a ceramic assemblage more reminiscent of the Creek Indians. Statistical comparisons of select sites occupied by the Creek and Apalachee demonstrate that these changes in ceramic surface treatments and tempers reflect adaptation to new social and geographical environments, rather than the emergence of a different ethnic group. This paper discusses the ramifications of Native ceramics more frequently representing varying communal responses, rather than only diffusion of new communities, during the frequently dramatic social changes the colonial Southeast.\n\nThe Pensacola-Mobile region of the 18th century was a nexus of cultural change, and the stage of a creolization of Apalachee identity. In the process of studying cultural hybridization experienced by dispersed peoples, new ceramic analysis methods were developed to answer research questions that necessitated minute levels of detail. These new methods added a nuanced depth to a study that required ample data to discuss late contact period culture change and have the potential to be applied for future research of other projects.\n\nAfter the destruction of their homeland in 1704, the Southeastern Apalachee dispersed across the Southeast, with two communities eventually settling along the Central Gulf Coast within 50 miles of each other. Residing in a complex cultural borderland created by constant Native American migrations and European power struggles, the Apalachee experienced rapid culture change in the 18th century, as evidenced by their material remains at the archaeological sites of Mission San Joseph de Escambe in Northwestern Florida and Blakeley Park in Southern Alabama. This thesis explores the nature of the cultural evolution the Apalachee experienced through a highly detailed ceramic analysis and includes a comparative analysis of both 18th century Apalachee settlements, as well as the sites of 17th century Apalachee Mission San Luis de Talimali and the late 18th century Creek village Fusihatchee. Making use of the theoretical perspectives of creolization, hybridity, and practice theory, it can be argued that 18th century Apalachee ceramics reflect a hybridized ceramic practice, influenced by cultural history, geographic location, and social networks.\n\nColono ware, low-fired earthenware in European form, has long presented a challenge to the archaeologist. The existing typology of colono ware has led to confusion and misunderstanding of these wares. Proposed here is a new, more consistent typology. Archaeological work at three Spanish presidios in Pensacola, Florida, recovered a number of fragments from colono ware and Mission Red Filmed ceramic vessels. The chronological and spatial separation of the three presidios afforded the opportunity to study how these ceramics and their usage changed through time. A study of these changes, along with the distribution of colono wares at two of the three presidios, has presented the opportunity to determine whether these ceramics can be used to answer questions about status and acculturation on the multi-ethnic Spanish colonial frontier.\n\nBy the early 18th century, the Northern Gulf Coast was a nexus of cultural exchange; home to many displaced native peoples. After the destruction of their homeland of Tallahassee in 1704, the Apalachee became dispersed across the American Southeast, contacting several cultures including the Creeks, several Mobile Bay and Mississippi Valley Indian groups, and French colonists. The Pensacola-Mobile region developed into a cultural borderland which facilitated creolization and hybridization of multiple ethnic groups. This discussion of Apalachee history examines the cultural transformations experienced by people in the 18th century, and to determine how it may be reflected in ceramic traditions.\n\nIn 1704 the Apalachee of La Florida dispersed across the Southeast, with two communities eventually settling in the Central Gulf Coast, some 50 miles apart. Residing in a complex cultural borderland created by constant Native American migrations and European power struggles, the Apalachee experienced rapid culture change in the 18th century. Making use of ceramic data from these two Apalachee settlements, as well as their ancestral homeland of San Luis and the 18th century Creek village of Fusihatchee, this paper examines how Apalachee culture evolved in the 18th century, and how it became evident in their hybridized ceramic practice.\n\nPaper presented in the symposium “Contact, Persistence and Change: Protohistoric and Early Historic Archaeology of the Gulf Coastal Plain” at the 72nd Annual Meeting of the Southeastern Archaeological Conference, Nashville, TN, November 19-21, 2015. Abstract: Though sporadically visited early in the European exploratory era, Native American groups of the Eastern Gulf Coastal Plain generally remained isolated from formal European colonization until Spain and France established twin colonies at Pensacola and Mobile after 1698. During the 18th century, multiple extralocal groups are documented to have migrated into an already transformed borderlands landscape, creating an ethnically diverse mix of cultures originally characterized by distinct regional material culture signatures. This paper uses a landscapes of practice approach to explore the extent to which emergent communities of ceramic practice correlated with documented ethnic and political identities in this region.\n\nBy the early 18th century, European encroachment into the American southeast had led to frenetic Native American migrations. The Apalachees, chased out of their Tallahassee homeland in 1704, had been reduced to two small village groups; one near modern Mobile, the other just north of Pensacola, reliant upon their European allies. The people in these villages shared a common ancestry, but with the rapid changes occurring in their world, they developed new relationships with neighboring communities. This study examines the influence of cultural change on these dispersed Apalachee villages through ceramic analysis and their subsequent transformation during the 18th century."
