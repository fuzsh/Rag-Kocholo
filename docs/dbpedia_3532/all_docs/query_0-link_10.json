Writers write. Actors, who are costumed and made-up, speak the words and perform the actions described in the script. Art directors and set designers develop the look of the film. The cinematographer decides upon a lighting scheme. Dialogue, sound effects, and music are recorded, mixed, and edited by sound engineers. The images, final sound mix, and special visual effects are assembled by editors to form a final cut. Moviemaking is the product of the efforts of these men and women, yet few film histories focus much on their labor. Behind the Silver Screen calls attention to the work of filmmaking. When complete, the series will comprise ten volumes, one each on ten significant tasks in front of or behind the camera, on the set or in the postproduction studio. The goal is to examine closely the various collaborative aspects of film production, one at a time and one per volume, and then to offer a chronology that allows the editors and contributors to explore the changes in each of these endeavors during six eras in film history: the silent screen (1895–1927), classical Hollywood (1928–1946), postwar Hollywood (1947–1967), the Auteur Renaissance (1968–1980), the New Hollywood (1981–1999), and the Modern Entertainment\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 2\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nMarketplace (2000–present).

Yet the ways in which directors have accommodated themselves to the constraints and opportunities posed by a complex production process and a commercial industry have often been relegated to the margins. The text-centered reading strategies employed by most film critics, which have been adapted from literary and art history models, are ill suited to the task of capturing the distinctive qualities of works created by Hollywood artists who partner with others and operate within a technologically complex commercial industry. Further, the widely accepted notion of a classical Hollywood style that remained relatively homogenous over a long period has discouraged many scholars from examining the changing historical specifics that have shaped the movies directors have been able to make. A common sobriquet used to refer to directors in trade publications, “helmers,” likens their role to that of the captain of a ship who must steer a hulking vessel through inclement weather and mechanical breakdowns while managing a large crew. Unlike poets and painters, directors must navigate their professional lives within a vast industrial framework that requires them to cooperate with others and to cope with intricate financial, legal, and organizational parameters. The present volume, which looks in depth at the way in which directors have worked 1\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 1\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n2 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nwithin the Hollywood system, has been informed by this understanding of their achievements. Each of the book’s chapters examines a particular period in Hollywood history, and, though each author adopts a unique focus and perspective, all address the ways in which directors have functioned within the sprawling enterprise that is the American film industry. This introduction contextualizes the case studies taken up in the chapters that follow, placing them within a broad framework that sketches out some of the major issues those studying directors in Hollywood must confront. It begins with a historical overview of the path that has led directors to their present position of eminence, then traces the varied routes individual directors have taken to enter the profession. It looks at directors’ daily routines and goes on to describe the nature of the artistry that lies at the heart of their claim to be thought of as authors in the high art tradition. A survey of the issues raised by the collaborative process in which virtually all Hollywood directors must participate follows. The introduction concludes with a brief analysis of the ethnic and gender privilege that has long been associated with being a director in Hollywood. In all of these areas directors have functioned as active agents, both individually and through their institutional base, the Directors Guild of America (DGA).\n\nFavored by History: Hollywood Directors over Time Historically, directors have not always enjoyed the privileged position they find themselves in today. Recalling his career at Biograph studios, Billy Bitzer stated, “Before [D. W. Griffith’s] arrival, I, as cameraman, was responsible for everything except the immediate hiring and handling of the actor. Soon it was his say whether the light was bright enough, or if the make-up was right.”1 Film historian Tom Gunning attributes this shift in power to the growing ascendency of narrative. A director, Gunning argues, could integrate elements of a production around a unifying center, “creating a filmic discourse which expressed dramatic situations.”2 In other words, directors acted as de facto narrators, staging scenes in a way that helped audiences understand the story being told. From 1909 to 1914 the studios operated under a system that gave directors authority over individual productions. Following the model of the theater stock company, directors like Griffith functioned as producers as well as directors, writing or selecting stories, choosing locations and settings, supervising production personnel, and overseeing editing. Beginning in 1912, however, this practice was gradually replaced by a system that gave directors control over principal photography while preproduction and postproduction became group efforts with producers in charge. By 1913 a scenario editor at Lubin could state, “Now the director does not see the scenario until it is handed him for production,\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 2\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 3\n\ncomplete in every detail.”3 As films got longer, production became more complex, as Charlie Keil describes in the first chapter of this volume. New positions were created: art directors, lighting specialists, cutters, and the like. Moreover, continuity scripts became indispensable because they enabled filmmakers to group together episodes set in similar locations and thus shoot scenes out of sequence. In this environment producers began to exercise supervisory powers over the shooting phase of a picture as well as over its preparation and postproduction. In this period, the system itself had many permutations, and the role of director varied considerably. Griffith added close-ups as pick-up shots after a scene had been filmed, while Cecil B. DeMille customarily used multiple cameras. Frank Borzage, Charlie Chaplin, and others worked from rough story outlines rather than finished continuity scripts. In 1917 Jesse Lasky announced that his studio would return to a director-centered system with writers closely involved with every phase of the process. “Each director in our four studios will be absolutely independent to produce to the best of his [sic] efficiency and ability,” Lasky stated. “With the discontinuance of a central scenario bureau each director will have his own writing staff and the author will continue active work on every production until its conclusion, staying by the side of the director even when the film is cut and assembled.”4 But Lasky’s initiative bucked larger trends, and directors continued to be positioned as participants in an increasingly corporate industry. By the 1920s what is now called the classical studio system was firmly in place, and most directors, along with other Hollywood artisans, worked under long-term studio contracts. Even though they were nominally employees, name directors occupied a position of privilege that they sometimes abused. For example, Erich von Stroheim’s exacting creative agenda led to extravagant expenditures on sets and costumes and endless retakes. As a result, his films consistently exceeded their budgets. His cut of Greed in 1925 clocked in at over five hours, prompting MGM production head Irving Thalberg to take the material away from his perfectionistic employee so that it could be cut down to a length more in line with prevailing theatrical standards. The 1930s saw major changes in the film industry that curbed directors’ authority and control. As William Luhr explains in the second chapter of this book, Hollywood’s conversion to sound in the late 1920s involved adding unwieldy equipment that made location shooting next to impossible. Moreover, the economic depression that struck the country shortly thereafter forced the studios to accept bank oversight of their operations, leading to a new emphasis on efficiency. Confined to studio sets where their work was closely monitored by executives, directors were not as free as before to impose their own styles on their films. During this period strong producers like Irving Thalberg and Darryl Zanuck had the most right to claim authorship of the films they oversaw. In 1936 John Ford grumbled,\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 3\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n4 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nAs it is now, the director arrives at nine in the morning. He has not only never been consulted about the script to see whether he liked it or feels fit to handle it, but he may not even know what the full story is about. They hand him two pages of straight dialogue or finely calculated action. Within an hour or less he is expected to go to work and complete the assignment the same day, all the participants and equipment being prepared for him without any say or choice on his part. When he leaves at night he has literally no idea what the next day’s work will be.5 Some directors were boxed in even further, for an assembly-line model was taking hold in which specialist directors could be assigned to supervise selected scenes in a given production, thereby functioning as pieceworkers. Busby Berkeley’s oversight of dance sequences followed this pattern, as did Raoul Walsh’s position as the Warner Bros. “tank man” whose job it was to direct all scenes shot in the studio’s water tank. Unhappy and unfulfilled as a result of being saddled with such conditions, directors had strong reasons for making creative rights an issue when they decided to form a union, the Screen Directors Guild (later renamed the Directors Guild of America), in 1936. As the 1930s drew to a close, the status of top directors improved markedly. Preston Sturges, who was then employed in Hollywood as a writer, labeled A-list directors of the day as “princes of the blood.” “The bungalows they lived in on the lot had open fireplaces and big soft couches,” he recalled. “Nobody ever assigned them pictures they didn’t like; they were timidly offered pictures. Sometimes they graciously condescended to direct them but if they said no, a story was a piece of cheese.”6 During this period, important directors like Howard Hawks began to flex their muscles by taking on the role of producers, a development that studio executives did not necessarily view kindly. For example, in 1937 when Hawks was working on Bringing Up Baby, RKO executive Lou Lusty sent a memo to his boss Sam Briskin about the director. “Hawks is determined in his own quiet, reserved, soft-spoken manner to have his way about the making of this picture,” Lusty complained. “All the directors in Hollywood are developing producer-director complexes and Hawks is going to be particularly difficult.”7 While studio executives increasingly kowtowed to star directors like Hawks, they continued to clamp down on the rank and file well into the 1940s. John Huston described the situation in his autobiography An Open Book. “After a picture commences, your work was monitored—usually by the heads of the studio along with your producer—before you had an opportunity to see them,” he wrote. “If they thought you were shooting an inordinate number of takes, there would be an inquiry. If a picture fell behind schedule, they would want to know exactly why. If anything untoward happened on the set, it was reported to the front office.”8 After 1948 the advocacy role taken up by the Directors Guild worked in concert with trends within the industry and the society at large to give directors ever\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 4\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 5\n\ngreater dominance over the filmmaking process. After the US Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that Hollywood’s business model violated antitrust statutes, the major studios were forced to give up their theater chains and thus their secure pipeline to exhibition venues. At the same time, television and suburban lifestyles drew audiences away from movie theaters. By the end of the decade the classical Hollywood system in which the studios functioned as film factories was crumbling. Like other Hollywood workers, directors, who had formerly been employees of the studios, now became freelancers. Some cast their lot with the burgeoning ranks of independent production companies, as Sarah Kozloff documents in the third chapter of this volume. For the fortunate ones who were able to make the transition successfully, the gains in creative autonomy made up for what they had lost in job security. Kozloff’s chapter also describes the way in which the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) targeted Hollywood left-wingers during the 1950s, branding some as communist traitors. Of the Hollywood Ten, who were imprisoned for contempt of Congress because of their refusal to cooperate with the committee’s agenda, two were directors: Edward Dmytryk and Herbert Biberman. Many more directors were denied work well into the 1960s as a result of the studios’ pledge to blacklist those who were suspected of communist sympathies. Some, like Elia Kazan and Robert Rossen, saved their careers by informing on their colleagues; others, like Joseph Losey and Jules Dassin, found work abroad. Still others had their lives and careers shattered beyond repair by the witch-hunt. One of the first witnesses to testify before HUAC was director Sam Wood, who charged in 1947 that the Directors Guild had been infiltrated by communists. The DGA issued a firm protest at the time, but the pressure continued. In 1950 Cecil B. DeMille, a powerful force in the Guild and a fervent anticommunist, forced a confrontation with the organization’s liberal faction over his proposal to have every member sign an oath of loyalty to the U.S. government. After a seven-hour meeting at the Beverly Hills Hotel in October of 1950, Guild president Joseph Mankiewicz, who found himself in the eye of the storm, issued a call to all members to sign such an oath. Mankiewicz’s action was motivated by a desire to save face for DeMille, who, along with the other DGA board members, had been recalled during the tumultuous meeting. Losing DeMille meant putting the Guild itself in jeopardy. “If Mr. DeMille is recalled,” John Ford declared on the fateful evening, “your Guild is busted up.”9 The DGA oath, the first one in Hollywood, remained in effect until 1966, when the courts declared it unconstitutional. During the 1960s and 1970s a number of factors conspired to aid directors in their quest for greater authority. Cinema sophisticates of the day turned toward foreign fare in which the names of writer-directors like Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman appeared front and center, inspired in part by the French-spawned\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 5\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n6 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nauteur theory that put Hollywood directors on a par with international ones. The theory took hold on American college campuses, nurturing a film generation of young cinephiles who went to movies looking for signs of directorial style. In response, as Daniel Langford notes in the fourth chapter of this volume, Hollywood turned to a new breed of independent-minded directors with an art cinema aura, a group that included Arthur Penn, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese. Desperate studio executives looking to connect with this new audience gave these and other maverick talents unprecedented control over their productions. This era of extreme directorial freedom came to an abrupt end following the 1980 release of Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate, a grandiose auteur-driven project that proved to be a commercial and critical disaster. The following generation of Hollywood auteurs, including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, and James Cameron, were less iconoclastic and more adept at exploiting the commercial potential of the movies they directed. They were backed by studios that were increasingly positioned as flashy outposts of giant multinational conglomerates. It would be a mistake to assume that the takeover of the Hollywood studios by multinational corporations in the 1970s and 1980s led Hollywood executives to view filmmaking through a lens focused solely on the bottom line. Prestige and an image of quality remained at the forefront, not only because these factors can define a given studio as a quality brand in the eyes of the public but also because they exert a potent emotional appeal to stockholders, management, and the Hollywood elite. Moreover, with the end of long-term studio contracts and the subsequent practice of crafting one-time deals, personal relationships have taken on new importance, and a desire to accrue cultural capital in the close-knit Hollywood community operates as a catalytic force. Under this system, directors have often benefited from the relationships they have managed to create with bankable actors, who frequently request a trusted director as a condition of their participation in a given production. Building on a strategy pioneered by super-agent Lew Wasserman in the 1950s, powerful agents often package projects to present to studios, teaming directors with writers and stars (canonical films like Some Like It Hot [1959] and Psycho [1960] were produced in this manner). Where directors were once hired by studio moguls, they now became their own bosses, hiring and firing the agents who brokered deals for them. In the fifth chapter of this volume, Thomas Schatz uses three case studies from Hollywood’s 1989 production slate to document the wide range of moviemaking practices during this period and the ways in which directors fit into them. By the turn of the twenty-first century, the digitalization of the industry presented directors with unprecedented filming options, as J. D. Connor chronicles in the last chapter of this book. By this point many directors had assumed a position at the top of the Hollywood hierarchy. In 1996 Paul\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 6\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nSchrader commented, “[Some] directors have complete control—Spike Lee, John Sayles, Woody Allen, Spielberg. It’s an extraordinary power that even Darryl Zanuck never had at the height of the studio system.”10 And directors as a group now have assumed unprecedented stature and influence not just within the industry but in the culture at large. Their newly elevated position is due in part to the ongoing efforts of the Directors Guild, which has won numerous privileges for its members including ever-increasing authority over all phases of the production process as well as control over directorial credits. All Guild members now have the contractual right to be consulted about scripts and also to prepare a cut of their films (called a director’s cut) prior to any further editing by producers.\n\nOrigins: Where Do Directors Come From? Unlike medicine or law, for a career as a director no special training or credentialing is required. Historically, most have moved into the profession from adjacent fields: acting (Edward James Olmos, Clint Eastwood, Ossie Davis), writing (Lois Weber, John Huston, Oliver Stone), producing (Stanley Kramer, Alan Pakula,), editing (Dorothy Arzner, Edward Dmytryk, Robert Wise), production design (William Cameron Menzies), cinematography (George Stevens, Haskell Wexler), or choreography (Busby Berkeley, Stanley Donen, Bob Fosse). Many, such as Ernst Lubitsch, Alfred Hitchcock, and John Woo, learned the trade abroad. Television has nurtured other directorial talents, producing an especially rich crop in the 1960s when figures like Sidney Lumet, Arthur Penn, and Elliot Silverstein, who had cut their teeth on live TV shows in New York, migrated to Hollywood. Still others, like Richard Lester and Ridley Scott, got their training directing commercials, while yet another group, including Peter Bogdanovich and Paul Schrader, began as critics. Increasingly, Hollywood recruits talent from film schools, especially the University of Southern California (USC), UCLA, the American Film Institute (AFI), Columbia University, and New York University (NYU). Each of these major pipelines tends to produce graduates with a distinctive style: from the smooth commercial savvy that marks USC grads like George Lucas, Ron Howard, and Judd Apatow to the edgy urban aesthetic of directors like Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, and Amy Heckerling, who attended NYU. AFI grads like Terrence Malick and David Lynch veer toward the cerebral and experimental. Columbia has produced a preponderance of Hollywood’s most successful women directors, including Kathryn Bigelow, Lisa Cholodenko, Nicole Holofcener, and Kimberly Pierce; while UCLA educated a notable crop of African American directors in the 1970s and 1980s, including Charles Burnett, Haile Gerima, and Julie Dash, a group that has come to be known as the L.A. Rebellion.\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 7\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n8 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\n“A Job of Work”: Directors’ Daily Routines In his landmark 1962 study, The American Cinema, critic Andrew Sarris ranked directors in relation to the stylistic brio they brought to their productions. Most of the subsequent writing on directors has followed Sarris’s lead, emphasizing the ways in which directors have marked their films with distinctive stylistic signatures that express what Sarris termed “inner meaning.” Some favor characteristic camera techniques like crane shots (Max Ophuls) or tracking shots (Vincente Minnelli). Others are associated with particular lighting techniques (Terrence Malick’s “magic hour” illumination, Joseph von Sternberg’s shadows). The films of still other notable auteurs feature resonant motifs such as mirror shots (Douglas Sirk) or staircases (Alfred Hitchcock). In a later phase of auteurism, critics like Peter Wollen described structural oppositions that could be identified with canonical directors like Howard Hawks (male/female) and John Ford (civilization/wilderness). But recognizing stylistic signatures is not the only way in which one can study the work of directors. Directing is a job as well as an art: directors direct or supervise motion picture productions, each such endeavor involving a host of human, technical, commercial, and industrial components. As John Ford once said, it is “a job of work.”11 During the heyday of the classical studio system, from the 1920s through the 1950s, directors were rarely consulted on scripts, which were customarily given to them shortly before shooting began. Nor did they ordinarily participate in the postproduction phase, which was the province of the editor, overseen by the producer. The job of the director was to guide principal photography. Table I.1 charts the way in which directors typically functioned within the system during this period. The system put in place by Thomas Ince in the early 1910s has always been subject to an infinite number of refinements and variations, but it provided a basic template that most productions followed in one form or another until the breakup of the studio system in the 1960s. Even today, Ince’s model functions as a skeleton onto which variations are grafted to meet the unique demands of each moviemaking venture. The scheme was devised to emphasize the creative dimension of a production by prioritizing “above the line” elements (directors, writers, and actors) over “below the line” technicians (the crew). To play their part in this byzantine process, directors call upon a wide range of skills. Veteran director Allan Dwan once described the director’s role by recalling, “They taught me three words. First, they told me to say, ‘Camera.’ And the next thing I’d say was, ‘Action.’ And the next thing, ‘Cut.’ You get those three words and remember them and you’re a director.”12 But the job of staging a scene is obviously far more difficult than Dwan cared to admit. Several directors have written how-to manuals about their profession, but these books are, for the most part, vague and chatty.13 The best source of information about directors’\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 8\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nTable I.1: Production Hierarchies in the Classical Hollywood Studio System STUDIO HEAD/ PRODUCTION CHIEF\n\nHires Personnel; Determines Company Policy and Company Style\n\nPRODUCER\n\nAcquires Property; Prepares Budget Estimate; Hires Above-the-Line Personnel (Talent)\n\nUnit Production Manager\n\nHires and Manages Below-the-Line Personnel (Crew); Manages Above-the-Line Personnel; Drafts Detailed Budget; Prepares Production and Postproduction Schedule; Oversees Day-to-Day Budgeting and Logistics\n\nPREPRODUCTION WRITER\n\nPrepares the Script Treatment and Shooting Script\n\nLOCATION SCOUT CASTING DIRECTOR\n\nHires Actors\n\nGRAPHIC ARTIST\n\nPrepares Storyboards\n\nPRODUCTION DESIGNER\n\nLocates/Designs Settings\n\nART DIRECTOR\n\nOversees Set Construction\n\nSet Decorator\n\nPRODUCTION DIRECTOR\n\nOversees Shooting\n\nSCRIPT SUPERVISOR\n\nMonitors Continuity\n\nFIRST ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n\nPlans and Monitors Daily Schedule; Sets Up Shots; Works with Background/Extras\n\nSECOND ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n\nPrepares Daily Call Sheets; Prepares Daily Production Reports\n\nSECOND UNIT DIRECTOR\n\nFilms Stunts, Location Footage\n\nCAST\n\nStars (and Acting Coaches), Supporting Players, Extras\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 9\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n10 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nCostumers, Make-Up Artists, Hairdressers CINEMATOGRAPHER\n\nSupervises Photography\n\nCamera Person Lighting Director\n\nPOSTPRODUCTION VISUAL EFFECTS TECHNICIANS EDITOR\n\nPrepares Daily Rushes, Rough Cut, Final Cut\n\nSOUND EDITOR\n\nOversees Looping\n\nFOLEY ARTIST\n\nCreates Sounds\n\nSOUND MIXER\n\nRecords Sound\n\nCOMPOSER\n\nAdds Musical Score\n\nday-to-day activities can be found in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward’s The Film Director’s Team, from which the following summary is derived.14 In accordance with Ince’s regimen, a director’s work usually begins with a production meeting of all major personnel held a few days or weeks before filming commences. The aim of such meetings is to troubleshoot potential problems and complications in advance. Once filming is underway, directors oversee a vast army of workers. The director’s team includes an assistant director who handles day-to-day scheduling, preparing a daily call sheet that specifies all personnel and equipment needed for the following day’s shoot. The assistant director also oversees extras and background details. A unit production manager keeps track of hours worked and budgetary matters in a daily film log, and is responsible to the producer. Each day’s filming proceeds more or less as follows: • All personnel, equipment, and props involved in the day’s shooting arrive on the set as specified in the daily call sheet.\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 10\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 11\n\n• The director stages the scene, deciding on camera placement and lighting for the first shot in consultation with the cinematographer. He or she then organizes a run-through with the actors, choreographing their movements (a process known as blocking) and rehearsing the dialogue, giving the actors feedback (called notes) when needed. • The director leaves the set, perhaps to work with the actors or prepare for the next set-up, while the first assistant director sets the stage for the shot to be executed. He or she calls in stand-ins to take the place of the actors so that the cinematographer can set up the necessary lighting and other details that will enable the filming to go smoothly. • The director returns to the set and films the scene. He or she begins it by calling “Camera!” which starts the camera rolling, then “Action!” which brings the actors to life. The take ends when the director calls, “Cut!” • The director determines whether the take is acceptable or needs to be reshot. If it seems worth preserving, he or she says “Print!” Even if the take is sent to be printed, the director may determine that an additional take is necessary. • The routine is repeated for each camera set-up throughout the day with the director in charge and the first assistant director monitoring progress for the front office. • At the end of the day the first assistant director calls “wrap” and the second assistant supervises the clean-up and distributes the call sheet specifying who and what is needed for the following day. • In the evening, the director, along with the producer and other crew members, views the rushes of the film shot that day to see whether retakes may be necessary. • Once all the scenes are filmed, the director’s job is finished, and the editors, supervised by the producer, take over. To keep to such a routine for weeks or months at a time requires a rare combination of qualities: a supreme sense of self-confidence in one’s ability to make quick, expensive decisions; unflagging physical and emotional stamina; and the charisma and leadership ability necessary to keep the confidence of the troops. Directors must also be ready to cope with a mind-boggling array of potential roadblocks, including unpredictable environmental conditions, perilous action\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 11\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n12 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nsequences, budgetary limitations, the unexpected death or incapacitation of a key team member, and censorship problems. To deal with such eventualities, directors must be flexible, quick-witted, and ready to compromise if need be. If they are able to turn such situations to their advantage, so much the better. George Stevens exhibited many of these qualities on the set of the 1965 film The Greatest Story Ever Told, when, after many days of shooting, unexpected snow in the Nevada location threatened to shut down the production. “[Stevens] summoned the entire production,” actor Max Von Sydow later recalled. “Everybody. And he asked them to excavate Jerusalem out of the snow. So, I think it was Sunday. Everybody went up with shovels and blowtorches and brooms and all kinds of things. And we managed to at least clear some of the area and shoot at least some close shots.”15\n\nDirectorial Artistry As we know, directors are not just supervisors; they are also stylists. As such, they occupy a special place in the Hollywood hierarchy. In an ethnographic study of the movie industry carried out in 1950, an anthropologist, Hortense Powdermaker, observed that directors were unique in that they were “primarily motivated by the desire to produce an excellent film, and more concerned about their craft than with profits.”16 The complicated dynamics involved in mounting a scene are designed with aesthetic ends in mind: the director is charged with carrying out each shot in a way that best serves the needs of the story.17 At the end of the day, it is this talent, along with the ability to get the best out of actors, that separates good directors from bad ones. Film scholar David Bordwell has described one version of this skill as “ensemble staging.” To illustrate, Bordwell describes in detail the way in which director Elia Kazan filmed two brief scenes in the 1950 production Panic in the Streets. The film chronicles the efforts of a medical officer (played by Richard Widmark) to contain a potential outbreak of pneumonic plague in New Orleans. The scenes Bordwell discusses involve numerous characters, some of whom are ignorant of the health threat while others know of it but must not tell. Each scene is handled in just two shots, and in each shot the camera moves inconspicuously. Without using a single close-up, Kazan’s staging strategy highlights complex emotional and intellectual interactions that occur among many characters, each one of whom has a particular stake in what is going on. Dramatic irony is maximized as our attention is subtly drawn to one or another of the characters though a significant play of light and shadow and a shifting depth of focus. Kazan’s dynamic blocking complements these techniques by moving the actors around the set in a way that focuses and refocuses our attention on one character after another, each with a different level of knowledge and a different stake in the outcome, as they\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 12\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nFIGURE 1: Panic in the Streets (Elia Kazan, 1950): Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) orders Lieutenant Paul (background, right) to burn all the bed linen used by the plague victim as Paul closes the door to the sickroom.\n\nFIGURE 2: In this shot from Panic in the Streets, a photographer’s flashbulb goes off just as a police officer in the background is about to sneeze and wipe his nose, causing Dr. Reed to look up from his microscope.\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 13\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n14 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\ndiscuss what must be done. The mise-en-scène, too, comes into play in the first scene as the door to the sickroom is opened and closed at salient moments. In an especially ominous touch at the conclusion of the latter scene, Kazan positions a policeman standing in the background wiping his nose just as a news photographer’s flashbulb catches him in a spasm of light, thereby foreshadowing the possibility of an epidemic.18\n\nSingularity: The Myth of the Lone Director Especially since the Romantic era, Western civilization has conceptualized art as the creation of a unique consciousness. Though Hollywood movies, which are manifestly created by large groups, fit uneasily into this mold, a number of factors may give rise to the impression that directors are singular artists in the high art tradition. The auteur theory has posed the idea of directors whose artistry may rise above the noise created by underlings, collaborators, and conditions. In addition, as Sarah Kozloff explains in the third chapter of this book, the possessory credit often appended at the beginning of the front credit roll (the credit that endows movies with labels like “Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho”) positions the film that follows as the property of its director. Such formulations and signs downplay the complex hierarchies and teamwork that bring Hollywood productions to life. Even the director’s chair itself may be occupied by more than one person; though the director of record is normally placed front and center, in the background are replacement directors, second unit directors, assistant directors, and stunt directors. One of the most significant groups promoting the idea that Hollywood films owe their existence to a single creator has been the Directors Guild of America. When the Guild first took shape in the late 1930s, the concept of the solo director took center stage. Frank Capra, who guided Guild policy during its formative years, had crafted the catchphrase “one man, one film” during the 1920s, and he molded the Guild’s agenda to promote this notion. “Any art creation should be the product of one mind,” he wrote in the New York Times soon after he was elected to the Guild presidency. “With that mind there should be no interference.”19 Thus, through the years the Guild has expanded the areas over which directors have control and has added restrictions to limit the conditions under which directors can be replaced. In cases where real control falls short, the Guild has ensured that the perception of control can take its place. One of the DGA’s first orders of business was to get jurisdiction over the allocation of directorial credits, and only in very rare occasions does it allow more than one director to get onscreen recognition for a film—even when more than one has worked on a given production. The trade publication Variety once listed 176 films made between 1970\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 14\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nand 1986 that were overseen by more than one director, but only in a very few cases did the directorial credit reflect this team effort.20 Famous instances in which more than one director put in significant work on a film but only one got credit include Gone with the Wind (1939; Victor Fleming [credited] and George Cukor) and Laura (1944; Otto Preminger [credited] and Rouben Mamoulian). An extreme case is 1963’s The Terror. As Roger Corman, the director of record, later described the filming: I shot two days of it on some standing sets from The Raven with only part of the script written. . . . And I had various people directing. Francis Coppola directed part of it. Monte Hellman directed part of it. Jack Hill did part of it. And the last day of shooting there was nobody available, and so Jack [Nicholson, who was acting in the film] said, “Roger, every idiot in town has directed part of this film; lemme direct the last day.” So I said, “Fine, Jack, go ahead.”21 Even when a single director is in charge of a production, he or she is typically supported by subordinates who may wield considerable authority. Second unit directors often film extended sequences in locations far removed from the watchful eye of the alpha-dog director. Directors with specialized skills may be in charge of stunts, montages, or dance numbers. Famed stunt director Yakima Canutt carried so much weight that scripts at Republic Pictures, where he worked on westerns during the 1930s, simply noted, “See Yakima Canutt for your action sequences.”22 In addition, while the director of record is charged with wrangling the featured players, assistant directors manage extras and background action. Robert Altman was almost fired from the production of M*A*S*H (1970) because he behaved more like an assistant director than a director by working closely with the background players rather than devoting his attention to the stars; his unorthodox approach was vindicated, however, when the picture became a major hit and garnered critical praise for its rich tapestry of background activity.\n\nDirectors and Their Collaborators The best directors guide their productions with a strong hand and mark their films with distinctive stylistic signatures. But in order to bring their visions to fruition, they must collaborate with many artisan-specialists. This is the arena where directors’ jobs as supervisors intersect with their aspirations as creative artists. There are, to be sure, figures like D. W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Spike Lee, and Woody Allen, who dominate every phase of their productions and hire personnel who can support them in achieving their particular visions. A few\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 15\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n16 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nother directors have managed to avoid at least some of the complications of collaboration by taking on tasks ordinarily parceled out to specialists. Some, like Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Mel Brooks, write their own scripts. Clint Eastwood has composed music for several of his productions and Steven Soderbergh often serves as his own cinematographer and editor. But in the overwhelming majority of cases, directors rely on the talents of others to complement their own. The most important of these specialized helpmates are producers, writers, actors, cinematographers, production designers, visual effects technicians, editors, sound designers, and composers. One of the aims of the present volume is to shine a light on the complicated interactions between directors and these often-marginalized creative partners. Directors’ collaborations with specialist colleagues operate differently in every case. Uneven power positions and states of knowledge come into play along with temperamental compatibility issues and communication glitches. In many instances the director and his or her team get on well; at other times, discord prevails. The outcome does not necessarily reflect the nature of the collaborative process; movie classics may emerge from sworn antagonists uneasily yoked together, while happy campers can produce flops.23 Each category of specialist comes with its own particular baggage. What follows are some examples that illustrate the special relationships that may exist between directors and their key specialist helpmates.\n\nProducers: Boosting the Business As the representatives of the financial interests that ultimately rule Hollywood, producers are typically more interested in commerce than art. They are usually the ones who hire directors, and they do so with commercial considerations in mind, aiming for an efficient production process and a marketable end product. In the studio era, producers like David O. Selznick and Arthur Freed wielded enormous power, and directors’ most effective method of opposition was passive resistance. William Luhr describes John Ford’s relationship with Twentieth Century–Fox studio chief Darryl Zanuck in these terms. Alfred Hitchcock employed a similar strategy of passive resistance in dealing with Selznick. Selznick brought the director to Hollywood from England in 1940 to make Rebecca, but he and Hitchcock did not always see eye-to-eye. Selznick wanted a women’s picture closely modeled on Daphne Du Maurier’s popular novel—a presold property— while Hitchcock wanted to turn Rebecca into another Hitchcock thriller. The director kept a stiff upper lip as Selznick tinkered incessantly with the script and editing of the film to maximize what he saw as its commercial potential. When all was said and done, Hitchcock felt that Rebecca was not really his own. “Well, it’s not a Hitchcock picture,” he told François Truffaut. “It has stood up quite well over the years; I don’t quite know why.”24\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 16\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nOne case in which a producer’s commercial interests complemented rather than clashed with a director’s artistry is Casablanca, produced by Hal Wallis and directed by Michael Curtiz. By 1942, when this now-classic film was being made, Wallis was as experienced and knowledgeable about all the aspects of moviemaking as anyone in Hollywood. Irene Lee, the Warner Bros. story editor who discovered the unproduced Broadway play that was to become Casablanca, judged Wallis this way. “Hal knew every aspect of pictures and, when he was at Warner Bros., he okayed every single thing—every costume, every script, every set.”25 Curtiz, for his part, brought energy and verve to the project, drawing on his feeling for drama to invest a stagy, meandering story with a sense of action and high emotion. Wallis understood his director’s strengths and weaknesses well and knew how to keep them in check. During production of The Adventures of Robin Hood, which the duo had worked on a few years before, Wallis warned his associate producer Henry Blanke about Curtiz’s style. “In his enthusiasm to make great shots and composition and utilize the great production values in this picture, he is of course, more likely to go overboard than anyone else.”26 Yet while he was aware of Curtiz’s excesses, Wallis consistently stood by his director and defended him when crew members complained.\n\nWriters: Weighing the Words Writers and directors have a long history of tensions. As William Luhr notes in the second chapter of this volume, directors like John Ford have always been inclined to cut out dialogue when a given point can be made visually. And, as J. D. Connor notes in the sixth chapter, directors like Adam McKay rely heavily on improvisation, discarding the script when inspiration strikes. To minimize any conflicts that may arise during filming as a result of such directorial interventions, the standard Directors Guild contract bars writers from the sets of movies they have scripted. Preston Sturges, who was both a writer and a director, was in a position to view the conflict from both sides, but came to appreciate the prerogatives granted to directors when he became one himself. “If anyone knows how a scene should be played it is the fellow who wrote it,” Sturges wrote in his autobiography. “Or so I once thought. I agreed with very few directors when I was merely writing. They argued tremendously, and sometimes they lost out. I look upon them now as brave fellows who went down with their colors flying. I don’t, as a director, film a scene exactly as the writer—who was myself—wrote it.”27 The collaboration between screenwriter Joan Tewkesbury and director Robert Altman during the development and production of Nashville in 1975 is an instance of a truly interactive writer-director collaboration. Altman’s only preliminary directives to the screenwriter were that the film was to be set in Nashville and the climax was to feature an assassination. Tewkesbury initially prepared a draft that featured eighteen characters bouncing off one another during three days\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 17\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n18 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\npreceding a star-studded benefit performance for a fictional presidential candidate. Altman then added six more characters and specified that the assassination victim should be an entertainer rather than a politician. He also cut much of the exposition and character motivation Tewkesbury had spelled out in her drafts. Once filming began, Altman encouraged his actors to write their own lines, but he and Tewkesbury kept a tight rein on the proceedings. “When actors would write things themselves, it didn’t mean you just spontaneously did it,” explained Henry Gibson, who played one of Nashville’s central characters. “You did it with the approval of Joan, because Joan had created this fantastic structure.”28\n\nActors: Crafting the Characters One of the most important jobs directors are charged with is to get the best out of their actors, but there is no single strategy for achieving this goal. Every director has his or her own method. Some follow the script to the letter; others like to create space for the actors to improvise. Some demand lengthy rehearsals and hone a performance through multiple takes; others prefer the spontaneity a first take can offer. Some, like Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges, offer specific line readings; others, like Alfred Hitchcock and Ridley Scott, leave actors largely to their own devices. Some engage actors in lengthy discussions about their characters’ background and motivations; others simply function as an appreciative audience. Still others may suggest tricks by which specific effects can be achieved, as Allan Dwan did when he coached silent superstar Douglas Fairbanks in the art of smiling by telling him to say “piss” for a subtle smile and “shit” for a wide grin. At times directors may resort to outright deception to coax a credible performance from a child. In order to wring heartrending sobs from seven-year-old Margaret O’Brien for a crucial scene in the 1944 Meet Me in St. Louis, for instance, Vincente Minnelli told her that her pet dog was about to be brutally murdered.29 Because performers’ backgrounds and expectations vary so widely, directors must be flexible enough to adapt to unforeseeable situations as they develop. Peter Weir describes the contrasting approaches he took to directing Robin Williams in 1989’s Dead Poets Society and Jim Carrey in 1998’s The Truman Show. Of directing Williams, Weir says, “[Our mutual] background of sketch comedy gave us a wonderful way of talking together because I could play the straight man with him and just drop back into those early days when I was writing and performing.”30 Dealing with Jim Carrey on the set of The Truman Show was more difficult. Weir later recalled the experience as follows: I think he’d always directed himself really prior to working with me, and I found that difficult the first couple of weeks because we’d do a take and he would come round and want to watch it and come up with new ideas. And I would say that we had what I needed. So I had a talk with him\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 18\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nabout it and said that he had to trust me to say we’ve got the shot. And he found that difficult. . . . So I said he shouldn’t look at the monitor again. He was coming to watch dailies anyway, so he knew what I was printing. After a couple of weeks, he just let me do my job.31\n\nCinematographers: Painting the Pictures Much of the ever-evolving knowledge of lenses and lighting techniques involved in cinematography is limited to those in the field, yet productive director-cinematographer partnerships have resulted in a multitude of memorable screen images over the years. Although a few directors know photography inside and out, most content themselves with supplying the vision that can awaken the inventive powers of their cinematographer-partners. In the early days, especially, such partnerships established the conventions that came to define the classical Hollywood style. At the behest of Lillian Gish, D. W. Griffith was persuaded to hire photographer Hendrik Sartov to shoot the soft-focus close-ups that subsequently became a staple of Hollywood glamour photography.32 In the 1920s Lois Weber worked with cameraman Del Clausen to develop strategies of double exposure and matting to show characters’ inner visions.33 Directors need not rely on technical know-how to come up with promising ideas that their cinematographers can give shape to. Alfred Hitchcock’s creation of the dolly zoom shot, which he used for the first time on his 1958 film Vertigo, is a famous example of such a collaboration. The technique was devised to enable the audience to share the dizzy sensation the hero experiences when he looks down from a great height. Hitchcock later described the incident that had inspired what is now sometimes called “the Hitchcock zoom”: “I always remember one night at the Chelsea Arts Ball at the Albert Hall in London when I got terribly drunk and had the sensation that everything was going far away from me,” he recalled.34 To replicate this effect, Hitchcock worked with his second unit cameraman Irmin Roberts to adapt a technique first devised by Romanian cinematographer Sergiu Huzman in which the camera dollies in and zooms out simultaneously. This celebrated shot was later used to good effect by Steven Spielberg in Jaws (1975) and Brian DePalma in Body Double (1984). John Ford is one of the few directors who had a thorough knowledge of cinematography. William Clothier, who frequently served as Ford’s director of photography (DP), once said of the director, “He knew more about photography than any other man who ever worked in the movies.”35 Perhaps because of this deep understanding of their craft, Ford treated his DPs as valued colleagues. The great Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, who worked with Ford on The Fugitive in 1947, described their relationship with admiration. On the day before shooting was to begin, Ford instructed Figueroa to find the best set-up for a long shot. Given the necessary authority, the cinematographer was able to set up the\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 19\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n20 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nappropriate lighting before Ford arrived on the set the next morning. Figueroa described what happened next: I asked [Ford] if he would like to check the set-up through the camera and after a puff on his pipe, [he] simply answered, “I am just the director, you are the photographer. But tell me: which lens are we using?” “28mm,” I said. “Okay. So you are cutting here and there,” and he began to indicate the imaginary limits of the space covered by the camera lens. It took Ford years of experience to be able to do this, and it made my staff and me aware of the kind of person we were going to work with.36\n\nProduction Designers: Setting the Scene Production designers and their art director assistants are in charge of what is in front of the camera to be photographed, and they, too, bring resources to a production that can enrich a director’s initial conception. At times, however, the director’s superior grasp of the way individual scenes fit into the larger arc of a film’s story overrides the production designer’s more limited purview. In other words, production designers are focused on space (the fictional world) while the director’s perspective also encompasses time (the progression of the narrative). The 1997 release L.A. Confidential, which Curtis Hanson directed and cowrote, is a good example of the specialized virtues production designers bring to the table. Hanson has called the film “my most personal movie.”37 He wanted to sustain the picture’s period feel by setting the final scene in a motel from the 1940s, and he instructed production designer Jeannine Oppewall to find an appropriate location. But after searching the city for such a place, Oppewall got another idea. “I ended up going back to my first images of L.A. when I got off the plane and drove by the oil fields,” she later said. She convinced Hanson to let her build a motel set amid a group of oil derricks, and she lobbied for a building designed in an older style from the one he had initially envisioned. “I wanted a motel that spoke about the first days of motels, the 1920s,” she explained.38 Hanson signed on to Oppewall’s idea, and she can take much of the credit for L.A. Confidential’s spectacular climax, which features a shoot-out in front of a ramshackle motel set in the shadow of towering oil derricks. Though L.A. Confidential profited from the input of a production designer, in many cases a director’s superior understanding of how a film’s story will play to audiences can override the integrity of the production designer’s decor. Lee Katz, who worked with Michael Curtiz during the 1930s, described an occasion when Curtiz drew on his sense of storytelling technique to override the spatial logic of a production designer’s set. “The master shot had a grand piano prominently in the foreground,” Katz told journalist Aljean Harmetz. “And when Mike moved\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 20\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nFIGURE 3: The motel set used for the climactic shootout sequence in L.A. Confidential (Curtis Hanson, 1997).\n\ninto a reverse shot, he said. ‘Take out the piano.’ And I said, ‘Mike, isn’t somebody going to say, “Where’s the piano?”’ And he said, ‘Believe me, if anybody asks, Where’s the piano? they’re not watching the picture.’”39\n\nCGI Technicians: Integrating into the Industry Since the turn of the millennium, visual effects artists have become essential partners for directors of splashy action fare, their work fueled by the wizardry enabled by computer-generated imagery (CGI). As a new entity in Hollywood, however, CGI houses have not yet been comfortably integrated into the industry’s labor force; and directors, however well intentioned, may find themselves in the middle of fractious labor disputes. An especially cautionary example of such a situation is Ang Lee’s 2012 Life of Pi, a production in which team spirit frayed under industry pressures. After months of tough negotiations with Twentieth Century–Fox over the high cost of the 3D visual effects needed to realize this intimate fantasy, Lee hired Rhythm and Hues Studios to create the necessary CGI. In the beginning, all was rosy. R&H visual effects supervisor Bill Westenhofer declared that Lee had initiated the partnership on a positive note by saying, “I look forward to making art with you.”40 But after the film was released, the relationship between Lee and his effects team soured. The CGI industry was, at the time, being squeezed by cutthroat competition over costs, and its workers were saddled with low pay and brutal working hours with no union protection. These conditions forced many companies, including Rhythm and Hues, into bankruptcy. Lee was drawn into the fray when he was quoted as complaining that visual effects for Pi were too expensive. Many CGI workers reacted to the situation by staging a protest at the Academy Awards ceremony where the film was to be honored. Lee’s reputation among effects artists sank further when he neglected to thank Rhythm and Hues in his Oscar acceptance speech.\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 21\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n22 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nEditors: Shaping the Story From their position at the end of the production process, editors, along with directors, have the best vantage point from which to view a film as a whole and hone the clarity and drama of its storytelling. As William Luhr points out in the second chapter of this book, experienced directors like John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock were able to shoot their films in such a way that editors were left with little flexibility; their pictures were more or less edited in the camera. Others, like Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman, emerge from the shooting stage with massive amounts of film that editors must then wrestle into some sort of coherent shape. On Nashville, for example, Altman shot over seventy hours of film for a movie that runs just over two and a half hours. To make the case that gifted editors can make significant contributions to a film’s dramatic impact, one need only look at the career of Francis Ford Coppola. Editor Peter Zinner claims to have come up with the idea for the bravura montage that caps the original Godfather film in 1972, a sequence featuring cheat cuts between a christening and a series of gangland hits that creates a breathtaking conclusion to the story.41 And the director’s long-time editor-colleague Walter Murch takes credit for the climactic moment in 1974’s The Conversation, often considered one of the director’s most personal statements. Murch relooped the crucial line, “He’d kill us if he got the chance,” from the taped conversation that gives the film its name. When the story’s protagonist Harry Caul replays his tape after unwittingly enabling a murder, the line’s emphasis changes to become “He’d kill us if he got the chance,” suggesting a murder plot in which the speakers are not the victims but the perpetrators. (The audience presumably remains unaware of Murch’s cheat; we assume that we, like Harry, have simply misunderstood the original playback.) The shocking impact of this moment gives the story its dramatic center, and the editor created it.42\n\nMusicians: Manufacturing the Mood Virtually all Hollywood films rely heavily on music to provide emotional depth, yet few directors know much about the musician’s art. Though most of them know what they like when they hear it and can make constructive suggestions, at times they require schooling. Some directors have become associated with particular musical motifs: John Ford’s folksy hymns and traditional country favorites are some of the most recognizable examples, along with the percussive, Wagnerian scores by Bernard Herrmann that animate many Hitchcock thrillers. Steven Spielberg has worked with composer John Williams throughout his career, a collaboration Williams described by saying, “His films are very rhythmical, and it makes it easier for me.” Though not a musician himself, Spielberg has a feel for the way the composer’s music will work in his films. He sensed, for example, that Williams’s uplifting theme in the 1982 release E.T. should have a longer melodic\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 22\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 23\n\nline, which could create a fuller emotional crescendo when the winsome alien ascends to the sky. At other times, however, Williams has been way ahead of his director-partner. For example, when he first played the shark motif in 1975’s Jaws, which famously relies on the alternation of just two notes, Spielberg said, “You’re kidding!” Williams responded, “You’ve made a very primal movie and you need primal music.”43 Spielberg, a quick study, got the point.\n\nA Privileged Few: Directors and Diversity Directing in Hollywood has long been a bastion of white male privilege. Despite the strides made by the civil rights and feminist movements on other fronts, the percentage of studio films overseen by female or minority directors has remained stalled in the single digits.44 One kind of explanation for this imbalance looks to the nature of the business, with its high stakes and high risks, factors that encourage clubbiness and insularity. A 1987 study by sociologists Robert R. Faulkner and Andy B. Anderson investigated the way in which the movie trade works by analyzing 2,430 films released by major studios between 1965 and 1980. They describe Hollywood as a uniquely high-risk industry: “The distinctiveness of this business seems to be in the completeness with which each film production is a separate and distinct commodity moving out into an uncertain market.”45 In the modern era of blockbusters the stakes have only increased. As a result, the hiring process relies on the tried and true. “The film community . . . is dominated by an active elite,” Faulkner and Anderson observe.46 They point to “a sharp separation between the elite (or ‘winners’) and the great mass of ‘non-winners’ on the periphery.”47 The short list of who is hired is a function of how they are hired. An Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation of Hollywood during the 1960s found “an overdependence on word-of-mouth recruitment.”48 And word-of-mouth favors the in-group made up of people like those who are already in power and others like them. For example, Stephen Spielberg claimed he chose Colin Trevorrow to direct Jurassic World because the younger man made him think of himself as he was years before.49 And it is not just the industry as a whole that bears responsibility; specific institutions within it have perpetuated the problem. After several decades of ineffectual initiatives consisting of diversity mixers, reports, and training programs, the Directors Guild stepped up to the plate itself in the twenty-first century by honoring diversity within its own ranks. Though the DGA had awarded prizes to female and minority directors of commercials and TV shows since 1984 and had presented a special award to Oscar Micheaux on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary celebration in 1986, it was not until 2000 that the organization fully embraced diversity by awarding a Best Feature Film Director accolade\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 23\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n24 Virginia Wright Wexman\n\nto a minority member (Ang Lee for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). In 2010 directorial honors in the feature film category went for the first time to a woman (Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker), and in 2013 Alfonzo Cuarón, the director of Gravity, was the first Latino to win the top prize. In 2002 the group elected its first female president, Martha Coolidge; and in 2013 the openly gay African American TV director Paris Barklay became the Guild’s first minority president. A close look at the evidence suggests that the daunting odds facing women and minority candidates attempting to break through Hollywood’s glass ceiling for directors can be bucked. As Daniel Langford documents in the fourth chapter of this volume, in the 1970s Hollywood beat the bushes to find African American directors who could make pictures that spoke to audiences in inner-city neighborhoods throughout the nation who had been energized by the civil rights movement of the previous decade. And in the twenty-first century three Mexican directors, Alejandro Gonzales Iñárritu, Alfonzo Cuarón, and Guillermo del Toro, broke into Hollywood’s A-list. They formed their own club, known as “The Three Amigos,” to support and encourage one another.\n\nChapter Organization and Focus Each of the following chapters features a different focus and approach, but all use primary research to cast new perspectives on the place and practice of Hollywood directors during various historical periods. Conditions within the industry and the culture at large form the background against which the achievements of selected directors are analyzed. In the book’s first chapter Charlie Keil examines the key part Cecil B. DeMille played in defining the directorial role in early Hollywood. William Luhr contrasts two major figures of classical Hollywood—John Ford and Orson Welles—in the second chapter, showing that even in an era when the movie business was at its most stable, two very different directorial talents could exist, each with a distinctive relationship with the industry that supported him. In the third chapter Sarah Kozloff looks at the trend toward independent production, which gained steam after the Second World War, analyzing the effect it had on two Hollywood directors of the day, Nicholas Ray and Ida Lupino. Next, Daniel Langford’s chapter on the auteur renaissance of the 1970s describes the ways in which the industry briefly encouraged personal films mounted by director-driven production companies and opened its doors to black directors, but then quickly abandoned these experiments. In the fifth chapter Thomas Schatz documents the range of practices in the New Hollywood by tracing the progress of three very different productions, Tim Burton’s Batman, Steven Soderbergh’s sex, lies, and videotape, and Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing, all released in the summer of 1989. Finally, J. D. Connor examines the effects of digital moviemaking and modern marketing on Hollywood directors in the new millennium.\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 24\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nIntroduction 25\n\nAs the volume as a whole documents, the concept of movie directors as singular creators outside of history, institutions, and culture oversimplifies the realities of Hollywood filmmaking. Directors are more than a series of stylistic tropes or libidinous signatures; they are also active agents. Their creative goals are affected by the industry they work in and the guild that represents them, and they pursue these goals in concert with a diverse array of colleagues. The book argues for greater attention to the details of production and the complicated, fraught process Hollywood moviemaking typically involves. Together with other volumes in the Behind the Silver Screen series, it brings forward the way in which our film heritage has been enriched by the partnerships into which directors have entered with members of their creative teams. Theories about the collaborative process and of the nature of institutional cultures can provide models that can frame such approaches with illuminating conceptual frameworks. What follows offers groundwork for scholars developing theories of this type. We will understand the achievements of Hollywood directors better as a result.\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 25\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n1 THE SILENT SCREEN, 1895–1927 Cecil B. DeMille Shapes the Director’s Role Charlie Keil When Cecil B. DeMille directed his first film, The Squaw Man, in 1913, the American film industry was at a turning point, marked by the convergence of a number of significant developments, among them the advent of the feature film, the shift to West Coast production, and attendant changes to the organizational processes governing how movies were made. Nineteen thirteen was also the year that D. W. Griffith ran an advertisement in the New York Dramatic Mirror, trumpeting his indelible contributions to cinema by declaring himself responsible for “revolutionizing Motion Picture drama and founding the modern technique of the art.”1 Griffith made a case for his status as the preeminent film artist in the United States by staking out the terrain of cinematic style and laying claim to every device imaginable, from the close-up to crosscutting. Moreover, Griffith asserted his singular achievements by arguing that all of the innovations that he had introduced were “now generally followed by the most advanced producers.”2 I dwell on Griffith’s self-promotional advertisement not to make a case for his uncontestable mastery of the medium by 1913, nor even to suggest that the 26\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 26\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nThe Silent Screen, 1895–1927 27\n\nad helped cement his status as the most famous filmmaker at work in the American film industry, though he may well have been so. Instead, I enlist this document to reinforce the idea that 1913 was a pivotal time for both the institutionalization of cinema and, consequently, the successful marketing of the idea of the director function. In other words, Griffith’s attempt to define himself as a film artist would scarcely have had any traction had that effort not possessed some value within the burgeoning industry at this time. (To verify this conclusion, one need only point FIGURE 4: The 1913 New York Dramatic Mirror advertisement that publicly established D. W. Griffith’s credentials as a out that up to this moment director of motion pictures. Griffith had remained unidentified by his former employer, Biograph, and that the ad operated as a way for Griffith to set his market value when selling his talent to the next company interested in hiring him.) In 1913, then, Griffith was not only attempting to secure his authorial legend, he was also helping to define the terms by which the still rather nebulous position of film director might be understood. (One should note, for example, that the ad tends to use the verbs “directing” and “producing” almost interchangeably.) For its maximal utility, the potential of the position had to be registered by both the film industry and moviegoing public alike, so the Griffith ad operates as a form of tutelage, no matter how self-serving. Soon enough, the industry itself would also influence how the public might perceive the director function, at the same time that it would set more firmly the parameters for the roles that directors would perform within developing studio practices. Coincident with the move to the West Coast and the wide-scale manufacturing of features, the industry progressively embraced a production model dependent on the rationalization of labor; concurrently, individual companies gained increased power and public recognition through enhanced levels of publicity and promotion, of both film texts and contracted personnel. If Griffith established a particular template for defining the director in his Mirror advertisement, one predicated on innovation and influence, it proved less\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 27\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n28 Charlie Keil\n\nof a signpost for the industry as a whole than its singularity at the moment of 1913 might suggest. The molding of the director function occurred as it was put into practice by the budding studio system, and that process did not rest within the control of a maverick like Griffith. The director function operated as part of a more expansive corporate strategy, in much the same way that the director as worker had to operate within the broader machinations of the nascent studios. No individual director of the 1910s could possess sufficient power to shape how studios came to define the role. But here is where Cecil B. DeMille, the figure whose directorial debut served as the starting point of this chapter, reenters the narrative. For a variety of reasons, DeMille, who quickly established himself as both an artistic and commercial success by the mid-teens, crafted a career that serves as a more likely model for the usefulness of the director function to the industry. Most obviously, DeMille’s facility in wedding melodramatic narrative formulae to a self-consciously inventive approach to lighting, staging, and editing seemingly demonstrated how a director could be an artistic benefit to a studio without the concomitant burden of becoming an economic liability. By emerging as a stylistically distinctive but profitable director, DeMille helped demonstrate the salability of the director function for an industry embracing new methods of production and distribution during the 1910s. As Gaylyn Studlar has observed, DeMille was gathering steam just as studios were “economically motivated to look for means [beyond stars] of securing the loyalty of motion-picture audiences . . . and audience expectations of a predictably enjoyable moviegoing experience depended upon [a] director establishing a solid record of favorably received films.”3 DeMille’s status as a crucial figure in our understanding of the film industry’s moves to define the director function during the 1910s extends beyond his mere marketability. Even more important may be his role as a studio executive during this period. Heading the Hollywood branch of Famous Players–Lasky for the first half-dozen years of his career, DeMille had to balance running a fledgling studio with the effort to define himself as an identifiable director in the public’s mind. Arguably, this experience helped to clarify for DeMille what the role of a director could be at the very time that the parameters of this vital creative position were still in formation. The years prior to 1913 represent a period where the director slowly gained prominence within the production process; DeMille’s seminal experiences as a hyphenate studio-executive/director in the mid- to late 1910s demonstrate how the studios embraced the director function as part of a broader strategy of industrial expansion. Moreover, DeMille himself came to recognize how he might exploit the role for his own career advancement. Cecil B. DeMille proved integral to the hierarchical conception of the director function that was devised during the 1910s, a conception that became as stratified as the star system that emerged at the same time.\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 28\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nThe Silent Screen, 1895–1927 29\n\nEarly American Cinema and the Shifting Role of the Director Changing conceptions of the director function are directly tied to evolving modes of production within the early American film industry. During the years that I have labeled the transitional period (from 1907 to 1913), effective storytelling became the primary goal of film producers; ultimately, the focus on intelligible stories, conveyed in a manner that would keep an audience involved in the narrative, put additional onus on the screenplay and the role of the director in translating that script to screen.4 Prior to 1907, an emphasis on the camera operator’s centrality to the production process had meant that the role of the director (such as it existed) received significantly less attention. Accordingly, the director function was often subsumed within the responsibilities of the camera operator. Whether one subscribes to the “cameraman system” model of production described by Janet Staiger or the “collaborative system” preferred by Charles Musser,5 one comes to the conclusion that directors did not consistently perform a clearly demarcated role within producing practices used for fiction filmmaking in the pre-1907 period. Typically the camera operator assumed primacy in the filming situation, not only controlling all the technological aspects (including lens choice and camera positioning), but also staging and coaching the actors. If, within the collaborative system, duties were not simply shared but split, one of the collaborators might well assume the responsibilities commonly associated with a theatrical director, leaving other, more technical tasks for his counterpart; this arrangement, according to Musser, typified the films made at Edison by George S. Fleming (an actor and scenic designer) and Edwin S. Porter (a cameraman).6 Tellingly, Porter is the figure now identified as the “director” of the films that the pair made for the company, indicating that the cameraman remained the dominant creative figure for films produced before 1907. Staiger and Musser also differ in their respective preferred typologies for production systems employed after 1907, with Staiger opting for “the director system” to name the method adopted in 1907–1909, and then “the director-unit system” for that prevalent until 1914.7 Musser, on the other hand, argues that a “central producer system”—which Staiger says did not become dominant until 1914— came into use as early as 1907.8 Staiger’s choice of the term “director system” is telling, as it signals the ascendancy of the director in the production hierarchy, though she concedes that “the terms ‘producer’ and ‘director’ were even used synonymously.”9 Staiger stresses that the role of the film director was patterned after that of the stage director, a function that had emerged within the context of modern theater in the 1870s. Such a model seemed appropriate for American cinema as it embraced narrative, and, as Staiger points out, many of the film directors who would gain prominence over the next few years, Griffith, Sidney Olcott, and Herbert Brenon among them, came from the stage, though usually their training had been in acting. In the director system, the director oversaw all\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 29\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n30 Charlie Keil\n\nstages of a film’s production (and even postproduction), with most distinct tasks (such as cinematography, set construction, and scenario writing) undertaken by designated craftspeople under the explicit supervision of the director. What both Staiger and Musser identify as the need for more product (demand coming from the rapidly expanding exhibition sector) hastened the introduction of new production systems that accorded the director more authority within an increasingly hierarchical division of labor. And despite their use of different terminology, they concur that, to use Musser’s words, “the process of reorganization favored the increased authority of the director . . . [as] areas of directorial responsibility were expanding.”10 As Musser points out, the director function was best positioned to make optimal use of the stock companies of actors that most manufacturers were now establishing to meet the increased production rates. With scenarios gravitating progressively toward character-centered narratives, the contributions of the actor gained more importance. And, as the figure responsible for the actors’ performances, the director moved into a position of prominence within the production chain of command. Directors enjoyed varying degrees of autonomy during this transitional period, as companies vied to make compelling story films that would please audiences and convince exhibitors of the value of a specific company’s output. While the production process was becoming increasingly hierarchical, the controlling influence of a central producer varied from studio to studio and from one shooting situation to the next. At Biograph, Griffith functioned as both producer and director, which meant that he could oversee the editing of his films, whereas directors at other companies (such as Edison) ceded that responsibility to a supervising producer. Despite the indisputably important role that the director performed within the production process, few companies afforded the director the near-complete autonomy that Griffith enjoyed (precisely because few directors also functioned as producers for their companies). Instead, the development of a central-producer model meant that directors would perform circumscribed tasks within a broader system of production. Tellingly, they remained anonymous workers for the majority of the transitional period; with most films from these years lacking credits, few clues exist as to the identity of the directors, let alone their respective contributions. The very anonymity of so many directors during the transitional period raises intriguing questions about how one attributes any associated authorial properties of the director function to seemingly “unauthored texts.”11 Griffith has become a privileged figure within histories of stylistic development during this period in large part because we know which films he directed. (Beyond that, nearly all of his films from the era have been preserved.) What Tom Gunning has defined as the “narrator system”—a type of visual discourse devised to maximize the effective representation of the dramatic situations at the core of this period’s scenarios—can certainly be linked to Griffith’s distinctive achievements in editing,\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 30\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nThe Silent Screen, 1895–1927 31\n\nframing, cultivating strong performances, and other aspects of film style. But Gunning also allows that the narrator system is a byproduct of the newfound and expanded powers of the director during the transitional period: “With Griffith, and most likely other film directors around the same time, the director was no longer an independent expert working with actors and then relying on the cameraman’s expertise for visualization.”12 Arguably, then, any director at this time could have taken the opportunity to capitalize on the changing production circumstances to develop his or her own version of a narrator system. Conversely, a strong central producer could curb any such tendencies toward eccentricity or overly self-conscious deployment of style, or point directors toward a deployment of stylistic means similar to that already established at the production company in order to create a definable house style. The transitional years operate as a fascinating and turbulent period in the emergence of the director function: on the one hand, the director had assumed the preeminent role during the production process, and took on this position of creative importance precisely at the moment that storytelling norms were changing at a rapid rate; on the other, companies exercised significant control over the final product, and the conditions of filming imposed short shooting schedules and substandard scenarios on directors who often had little training. While the trade press encouraged production companies to be innovative and build their own brand by devising “new and original tricks,”13 many directors found it difficult to integrate all of the skills necessary to translate a script into a compelling exercise in storytelling. Imitation was often the order of the day, as Allan Dwan confessed when recalling his early career at the American Film Manufacturing Company: “I had to learn from the screen. I had no other model. We picked up and manufactured what technique we could, watched the other fellow.”14 The results could be underwhelming, particularly at fledgling companies whose directors lacked experience. When Mary Pickford was sued by the Independent Moving Picture Company (IMP) for trying to defect to rival Majestic in 1911, she defended her decision to breach her contract with IMP by claiming that its stable of directors was substandard: Repeatedly during the term of my employment, I spoke to Mr. Laemmle, the President of the plaintiff company, with reference to the poor quality and directorship of the pictures in which I appeared. I called his attention to the fact that Mr. Clifford, Mr. Ince, Mr. Grandon and others who directed pictures in which I appeared had never directed moving pictures before, and that the result was that pictures of a poor quality were produced. Mr. Laemmle agreed with me that the pictures were not up to the highest standard and that the directorship should be improved, but nothing was done except to supplant one director with another, and no competent director was ever placed in charge.15\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 31\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n32 Charlie Keil\n\nAs the feature era loomed, some of the central struggles concerning the director function came into sharper relief. The quality of the direction was paramount insofar as it would translate into the effective visualization of story ideas. Qualified and experienced directors were preferred over neophytes, but only if the trained director could offer a strong command of storytelling. Motion picture production companies continued to exert control over the filmmaking process, using departmentalized labor organized according to the efficiency principles of Taylorism, and assigning projects, budgets, stars, and running time limits to directors in advance. Artistic ambition was valued, but only insofar as it aligned itself with the financial prerogatives of the company. It is within this industrial context that Cecil B. DeMille emerged as probably the most successful cultivator of the director function that the American film industry had yet witnessed.\n\nCecil B. DeMille, the “Director General” of Famous Players–Lasky Cecil B. DeMille, like many early silent film directors, began his career in the theater. He encountered Jesse Lasky when Lasky was pursuing his own stage endeavors, and the two formed an alliance. Cecil was born into a family that fully embraced the theater: his father, Henry, had become a playwright after abandoning his career as a schoolteacher, and both Henry and his wife, Beatrice, embarked on summer tours as actors when their children were young.16 In 1886, Henry’s second produced play, The Main Line, was directed by David Belasco, whose career was gaining momentum at this point. Belasco’s command of stage mechanics emphasized the spectacular dimensions of Henry de Mille’s17 text, and the relative success of The Main Line led to an ongoing collaboration between the two men. Belasco would remain an important figure for the de Mille family, even after Henry’s sudden death from typhoid in 1893. Despite their father’s express wish to the contrary, and with their mother’s assistance, both Cecil and his older brother William began to work in the theater early in adulthood. Cecil started picking up acting jobs in 1900, at the age of eighteen, while William’s immersion in playwriting around the same time resulted in his first produced full-length work, Strongheart, five years later. The brothers occasionally collaborated on writing plays, but William first experienced significant success on his own, particularly with the Belasco-directed The Warrens of Virginia, which debuted in 1907. Cecil was cast as the female protagonist’s brother, sharing the stage with a young Mary Pickford. His sustained involvement with Belasco would prove influential on his subsequent efforts as a film director. In his autobiography, Cecil recounted a subsequent experience with Belasco, when the showman commissioned a play from the budding writer in 1910, only to take the credit for its creation himself once he had reworked it extensively in rehearsals. Though chastened by the betrayal, and angered to the point that he\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 32\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nThe Silent Screen, 1895–1927 33\n\nFIGURE 5: A publicity photograph, circa 1916, of executives from the Famous Players–Lasky Corporation. From left: Jesse Lasky, Adolph Zukor, Samuel Goldwyn, Cecil B. DeMille, and Al Kaufman. Note that even at this early date, DeMille had adopted his director costume of open-necked white shirt and jodhpurs.\n\nleaked the story to the newspapers, Cecil refrained from taking legal action; in fact, as he pointed out, “I never worked with Belasco again, but when he was ready to sell the motion picture rights to his plays, it was to our company that he entrusted them.”18 Retreating to the position of general manager of his mother’s production company, Cecil found himself commissioned to write the book for a one-act comic operetta that Jesse Lasky, a vaudeville impresario, was preparing for production. The success of that work, entitled California, led the men to work together on two more similar confections.19 In 1912, Lasky proposed that Cecil join him and Lasky’s brother-in-law, Samuel Goldfish (later Goldwyn), a glove salesman, in a moviemaking venture. Together with Arthur Friend, the four formed the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, a business arrangement that initiated DeMille’s career in motion pictures. The Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, which originated in New York, was an early American attempt to cultivate the growing audience interest in feature films; DeMille got in at the ground level, making his directorial debut with a feature, The Squaw Man, at a time when one-reelers were still dominant, and filming in Hollywood when the East Coast was still the center of production. In fact, the Lasky Company established its secondary base of operations in Southern California with the shooting of The Squaw Man in Hollywood. Within a few years, the Lasky Company would be enfolded as a prestige brand\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 33\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\n34 Charlie Keil\n\nwithin Famous Players, a larger concern headed by the enterprising Adolph Zukor.20 By the time of the merger, the Lasky Company had expanded its physical plant in California several times over and DeMille was ensconced as the head of West Coast production. With the formation of Famous Players–Lasky in 1916, DeMille formalized his role within the new organization via a contract that allowed him an annual salary of $52,000 and the option to produce one big picture per year.21 DeMille’s title proves of particular interest—he was designated director general. Unlike the more prosaic labels for the positions held by other high-ranking executives, such as president Adolph Zukor and vice president Jesse Lasky, DeMille’s implies a managerial role while also acknowledging his status as a film director. DeMille’s insistence that he be allowed to make one special (i.e., big-budgeted) film per year underscores the fact that he remained attached to his status as a director and that public recognition of his name would derive from the high-profile films he helmed. But within the Famous Players–Lasky corporation, DeMille’s influence was tied primarily to the managerial clout he exercised in running the West Coast studios. As executives who functioned as high-level production managers, Lasky and DeMille were heavily involved in the creative processes central to studio filmmaking and often commented on the role of directors. From their correspondence, we can detect three principal ways in which the director function was conceived: as a measurement of resource allocation; as a role in the production process distinct from the writing function; and as an asset in itself when it came to matters of staging or some other demonstration of artistic distinctiveness. I take up each of these factors in turn, indicating how each conveys a sense of the way in which the director function might contribute to the proper operations of the studio. If we keep in mind the chief concerns of Famous Players–Lasky during the 1916–1919 period—ensuring a steady supply of feature-length films that would garner the good will of exhibitors—we can see that the company aimed to achieve its goals through timely delivery of product that met a certain standard of quality. Meeting these goals was dependent on the director function assuming its requisite role within the production process. As Zukor succinctly put it in a telegram from 1917: “Assure DeMille and others if pictures made at coast will be good [in] story as well as production our proposition will loom up even beyond our wildest expectation.”22 As Famous Players–Lasky ramped up production, the company became more mindful of efficiency, both to ensure that delivery schedules were met, and to fully realize the return made on the investment in stars. Lost time translated into squandered salaries, as Lasky pointed out in 1916 when he told DeMille that a director’s inability to stay on schedule damaged the company’s profit margin, “with Pickford costing us $1666.66 for each week day.”23 An unsigned letter\n\nwexmanText_RUP 2.indd 34\n\n9/12/17 8:49 AM\n\nThe Silent Screen, 1895–1927 35\n\nwritten around this time to M. E. Hoffman, the general manager of the West Coast studio, elaborated on how proper deployment of the director function could maximize the yield from a star: “You will see by her contract that Fannie Ward is guaranteed 47 weeks, therefore it is our intention to work her as hard as possible. In other words we will try to get well ahead in her scenarios so that the director who shoots her pictures can go right from one to the other with as little delay as possible.”24 At this point the Hollywood studio employed five directors in addition to DeMille. DeMille himself was to be “occupied principally with special productions.”25 Just three months later, Lasky advised DeMille that the studio would need to “work 7 and sometimes 8 directors, not including yourself, all winter at the Hollywood studios. I asked Arthur [Friend, the company’s treasurer] to explain this to you before he left for the west and he tells me that you will have to enlarge the studio generally to accommodate this number of directors.”26 Production was tied to directors, who set the pace as a measurement of time to be spent and funds allocated. As Goldwyn’s wife, Blanche Lasky, who was charged with overseeing screenwriting on the East Coast, cautioned, “We all must realize that a scenario that takes six weeks to write is too expensive, under present conditions, and would require a tremendous department if we are to keep up with the directors.”27 Though Famous Players–Lasky wasn’t employing a unit production model per se, it was conceiving of its productivity in terms of measurable director activity. Observing how the recently acquired Bosworth plant operated, Lasky remarked that Bosworth had “a system for working two directors alternately on a star, [allowing] a director 18 days to shoot a picture and 18 days lay-off to cut and prepare for his next picture. The second director starts immediately after the first director finishes shooting and works during the time that the first director is laying off.”28 Not only were directors responsible for containing costs through maintaining schedules; they were also meant to manage the postproduction process so that films didn’t exceed a set running time. Observing these limits was necessary to prevent exhibitors from having to handle unwieldy and overly long programs. But, as Lasky pointed out, the cost of film stock was also an issue. “[Once] the directors have pledged themselves not to deliver pictures for a final OK until they are down to the required length,” he wrote, “[the company] will save between $200,000 and $300,000 per year on positive stock alone.”29 As much as the director function served as a mechanism for tracking the rate of production, and, by extension, rationalizing the allocation of company resources, it was also meant to designate a stage in the production process that logically followed the preparation of the scenario.

Whenever he can get good material out of the director’s ideas he will incorporate them into the scenario and in a word get the best possible out of the story through the co-operation of the Continuity writer and the director.”30 The clearly delineated functions of director and continuity writer had to be kept separate to ensure the unimpeded channeling of material from scenario to finished film. DeMille and Lasky exchanged several letters concerning this topic when Cecil’s brother William attempted to subvert the system by serving as a writer while also directing.
