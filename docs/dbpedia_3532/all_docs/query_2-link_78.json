        "text": "*½/****\n\nstarring Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, John Goodman\n\nscreenplay by Todd Phillips & Craig Mazin\n\ndirected by Todd Phillips\n\nby Angelo Muredda When Project X spilled forth from its amniotic\n\nseptic tank last spring, I read it as a prime example of a\n\nproducer-driven form of auteurism pioneered by Judd Apatow. That found-footage\n\nchronicle of a house party-turned-apocalypse, I suggested, was a monument to\n\nproducer Todd Phillips's equally noxious Hangover series, where the same Dionysian impulses and\n\ndeep-seated hatred of the different–whether female, trans, queer, or\n\ndisabled–were championed by a trio of middle-aged men. What a difference a\n\nyear makes. If Project\n\nX was a brand\n\nconsolidator and The\n\nHangover Part II\n\nwas a morbidly curious recalibration of its predecessor, displacing Phillips's\n\ndemonic impulses and scarcely controlled misogynist rage from Bradley Cooper's\n\nPhil to Ed Helms's Stu, Part\n\nIII is an actors'\n\ncontract negotiation sputtered to life. Since the previous instalment, Cooper has\n\nbecome a respectable leading man and Oscar nominee and Helms has been savaged\n\nfor the degeneration of his irritating Andy Bernard character on \"The\n\nOffice\", while co-star Ken Jeong's fortunes have inexplicably risen.\n\nConsequently, gone now are the days of Phil's \"Paging Doctor Faggot,\"\n\nalong with Stu's loveable dude-rage and the Wolfpack's infinite jokes about Mr.\n\nChow's shrunken Asian manhood. In their place is a surprisingly neutered, if\n\ninarguably more ethical, product with very few laughs and no reason for being.\n\nDUE DATE\n\n***½/**** Image A Sound A Extras C-\n\nstarring Robert Downey Jr., Zach Galifianakis, Jamie Foxx, Michelle Monaghan\n\nscreenplay by Alan R. Cohen & Alan Freedland and Adam Sztykiel & Todd Phillips\n\ndirected by Todd Phillips\n\nMEGAMIND\n\n**/****\n\nscreenplay by Alan J. Schoolcraft & Brent Simons\n\ndirected by Tom McGrath\n\nby Ian Pugh SPOILER WARNING IN EFFECT. Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is eager to fly out of Atlanta back to Los Angeles to witness the birth of his child, but a chance encounter with wannabe actor/lone weirdo Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) lands the pair on a no-fly list and leaves Peter without his luggage or his wallet. With no alternatives, Peter becomes Ethan's unwilling passenger–taking a seat alongside a small dog and the ashes of Ethan's late father–on a road trip west. There appears to be a general consensus that the premise of Todd Phillips's Due Date too closely resembles that of John Hughes's Planes, Trains & Automobiles, but there's a vital difference in that Due Date's lead characters are legitimately crazy. The exasperated straight man is re-imagined as a sneering jerk full of jealousy and rage (Downey Jr. maintains a cold, sweaty stare throughout), while the lovable klutz is a dangerously irresponsible lout. Roger Ebert once wrote that the Hughes film was about \"empathy [and] knowing what the other guy feels.\" So it is; by virtue of its characters, Due Date bypasses empathy altogether, yet it still talks about treating other people with a modicum of compassion. Phillips has finally made a naughty comedy that contemplates the consequences of its actions. Here's a movie in which a father-to-be grows so frustrated with an annoying boy that he socks him in the stomach, then unknowingly mocks a disabled veteran (Danny McBride) and gets his ass kicked for it.\n\nZERO STARS/**** Image B Sound B+ Extras D\n\nstarring Julia Roberts, James Franco, Richard Jenkins, Javier Bardem\n\nscreenplay by Ryan Murphy & Jennifer Salt, based on the book by Elizabeth Gilbert\n\ndirected by Ryan Murphy\n\nby Walter Chaw It's a little tempting to not take the piss out of this latest instalment of How Julia Got Her Tube Packed, but the sins of Ryan Murphy's unwatchable Eat Pray Love are such that it's nigh impossible for any sentient human to resist. More interesting might be to chart the route America's sweetheart has taken to becoming one of the most irritating and hateful personas in the modern pantheon–how the once top-earning female star is lately this pinched, drawn, graceless thing trying her best and in vain to recapture the sociopathic sprightliness of her early successes. It could simply be the natural process of aging that makes it harder for her wronged-woman act to cull any sympathy: a 43-year-old woman making pouty lips and acting out is a much different animal than her 23-year-old self doing same. If she were to poison her husband or steal her best friend's bridegroom now, it would play very differently. And play differently it does as she dumps her non-descript/non-character hubby (Billy Crudup, typecast), buys an Italian phrasebook (\"Every word in Italian is like a truffle!\" the moron says), and travels to Bali in search of wisdom at the feet of adorably helpful minorities who only exist in movies like this to help coddled, rich, white people be content with their unimaginable privilege. If On the Waterfront was Kazan's apologia for singing like a canary, then Julia's late career seems an apologia for buying someone else's husband and getting away with it, for the most part, in the court of public opinion.\n\n****/**** Image A Sound A Extras A\n\nstarring Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, Luke Askew\n\nscreenplay by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Terry Southern\n\ndirected by Dennis Hopper\n\nWATCH IN iTUNES\n\nby Walter Chaw SPOILER WARNING IN EFFECT. It's not easy to mark the beginning of the Sixties as an idea. Me, personally, as it's the way I'm wired, I like to use as the starting gun the trilogy of dysfunctional pictures–Psycho, Eyes Without a Face, Peeping Tom–that literally inaugurate the decade, but I'd also accept that 1962's Cuban Missile Crisis was enough for many of the nearly-disaffected to become completely what-the-fuck disaffected. And if you go with that, then what happens at the end of 1963 with the assassination of JFK is that Zapruder places film as the end-all of Truth. A lot changed with those 26.6 seconds of film–or, should we say, a lot changed back, to a period where the newsreel, no matter how doctored or fabricated, was the primary mass means of information-gathering before television began to encroach on it. A lot of ink's been spilled about the extent to which movies in the mid-to-late-Fifties tried to outdo the boob-tube with grand Technicolor visions; comparatively little has been written about Zapruder's 486 colour frames, which stole the thunder of television's hold on vérité–remember, in 1960, Hitch wanted to shoot Psycho in a televisual style for its implicit realism–as elegantly as a shell fired from a mail-order Carcano. TV achieves a stalemate by broadcasting Vietnam during the dinner hour, yet it doesn't win outright until the '90s when it embraces shakycam and film unveils itself once and for all as a magician's medium: smoke, mirrors, Forrest telling LBJ he needs to piss, and the Titanic going down again to the tune of a tween tearjerker.\n\nBROTHERS\n\n***/****\n\nstarring Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, Mare Winningham\n\nscreenplay by David Benioff, based on the motion picture Brødre by Susanne Bier\n\ndirected by Jim Sheridan\n\nEVERYBODY'S FINE\n\n*/****\n\nstarring Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell\n\nscreenplay by Kirk Jones, based on an earlier screenplay by Massimo De Rita & Tonio Guerra & Giuseppe Tornatore\n\ndirected by Kirk Jones\n\nby Ian Pugh If you're feeling charitable towards Susanne Bier's Brødre, you'll probably consider Jim Sheridan's Brothers an extraordinarily faithful remake–one that follows the original recipe so closely it could be considered a step-by-step recreation. But a quick survey of what screenwriter David Benioff excised and expanded reveals that he wasn't merely a glorified script doctor, having squeezed some real pathos from a tactless source. It's still the story of a loving father, Sam (Tobey Maguire), who is forced to perform unspeakable acts as a POW in Afghanistan. Because Sam's presumed dead, his ex-con brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal, finding the perfect balance between guilt and innocence) straightens out his life and grows ever closer to Sam's wife (Natalie Portman) and children. Sam's sudden reappearance in their lives is further complicated by the onset of the soldier's post-traumatic stress, but gone are the heavy-handed lines about the nature of good, evil, and death from Bier's film. In their place, moments of shaky acceptance as new members are integrated into a family–followed by stares of betrayal as loved ones become interlopers in their own home.\n\n**½/**** Image B Sound C Extras C+\n\nstarring Lou Taylor Pucci, Zooey Deschanel, Jena Malone, Maura Tierney\n\nwritten and directed by Martin Hynes\n\nby Alex Jackson Martin Hynes's The Go-Getter is a sweet but thin wafer of a movie. It isn't great art, it doesn't evoke an especially strong or complex emotional reaction, and it doesn't ask any difficult questions. It doesn't aspire to do anything more than pleasantly and efficiently eat up an hour-and-a-half of your time. That's the very definition of faint praise, but praise I'm offering it all the same. When I first saw the film at Sundance in 2007, I felt rejuvenated. This had come after a string of bad movies that nonetheless demanded a lot from me. The sheer frivolousness and good cheer of The Go-Getter was a kind of tonic that helped me remember why I love the movies in the first place. Still, I knew enough to only give it two-and-a-half stars, and my second viewing pretty much confirms that two-and-a-half stars is about right.\n\nKill Bill, Vol. 2\n\n****/**** Image A Sound A Extras C+\n\nstarring Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah\n\nwritten and directed by Quentin Tarantino\n\nby Walter Chaw Genre poetry from B-movies' poet laureate, Quentin Tarantino's conclusion to Kill Bill is marked by the filmmaker's carefully-calibrated celluloid insanity, as well as a deceptive maturity that allows a few powerfully-struck grace notes for the cult of femininity and the sanctity of motherhood. Its first portion overwhelming for its craft before lodging in the craw with its ever-present but tantalizingly difficult-to-nail moral code, Tarantino's epic whole clarifies a dedication to a sort of low, Samuel Fuller/Nicholas Ray tabloid cosmology, grounding itself eventually in the bold, lovely, curiously old-fashioned declaration that the last best reward is to be true to the primal clay of an idea of innate gender roles. The Bride (Uma Thurman) is so named not merely for camp grandeur's sake, but also to highlight the power of cultural archetypes and their roots in biology.\n\nKill Bill, Vol. 1\n\n****/**** Image A- Sound A Extras C+\n\nstarring Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, David Carradine\n\nwritten and directed by Quentin Tarantino\n\nby Walter Chaw There is a palpable, undeniable perversity to Quentin Tarantino's fourth feature film, a taste for the extreme so gleeful and smart that its references are homage and its puerility virtue. I seem to find a reason between every Tarantino film to dislike him, to cast aspersions on my memories of his films, but I'm starting to think the source of my dislike is jealousy. Tarantino is the director Spielberg is too timid to be: a gifted visual craftsman unafraid of the contents of his psychic closet, and a film brat whose teachers happen to be blaxploitation, samurai epics, and Shaw Brothers chop-socky instead of John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock. And it isn't that I have aspirations of becoming a filmmaker, it's just that I want to be as good at something as Tarantino is at making movies.\n\nFREE ZONE\n\n*/**** Image C- Sound B Extras F\n\nstarring Natalie Portman, Hanna Laslo, Hiam Abbass\n\nwritten and directed by Amos Gitai\n\nTHE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS\n\n*½/**** Image A- Sound B+\n\nstarring Sarah Polley, Tim Robbins, Javier Cámara, Julie Christie\n\nwritten and directed by Isabel Coixet\n\nby Walter Chaw The not-at-all-hamfisted allegory of an Israeli woman and a Palestinian woman trekking across the disputed land to find an American who will settle some non-specific debt, Amos Gitai's tediously strident Free Zone opens with ten minutes, uninterrupted, of Natalie Portman weeping over what we discover to be the end of a love affair. It's showy and about as subtle as a kidney-punch–ditto the conception of Portman's passive Rebecca (Portman), the American on the sidelines, a matinee-beautiful beacon who stands by as impassively as Milton's God. That said, the device of a long, car-bound road trip narrated by flashbacks of the protagonists' separate journeys to this journey is, at least for a while, intoxicating. The problem–and it's a doozy–is that Gitai's picture is so blatant an allegory that nothing any of the characters say comes free of dramatic distance or irony, making it impossible to take the film seriously as anything other than ventriloquism for Gitai's, let's face it, unsurprising politics. Nothing wrong with Wailing Wall lamentations about the state of the world, but watching someone shake a fist at a dead horse, long past the hope of resurrection, for upwards of two hours, is tiring and futile. Is there traction in proposing that the film merely mirrors the hopelessness of the Middle East conflict? I guess, but then how many people–specifically, how many people renting a film called Free Zone directed by Amos Gitai–are going to feel edified by that?\n\n**½/**** Image A+ Sound A Extras B\n\nstarring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern, Willem Dafoe, Crispin Glover\n\nscreenplay by David Lynch, based on the novel by Barry Gifford\n\ndirected by David Lynch\n\nby Travis Mackenzie Hoover Back when I ran my website DAYS OF THUNDER, I identified the problem with David Lynch in general (and with Mulholland Drive in specific) as that of a man who didn't want to know: his films tend to revolve around bland milquetoast heroes and heroines who open Pandora's Box and then either become destroyed or must stuff horrible people back inside. But when I wrote that, I had repressed the memory of Wild at Heart, which chucks Velveeta America entirely and imagines a world run by Frank Booth and his ilk. Indeed, Wild at Heart wallows in the kinds of kinky horrors that are viewed in Lynch's other films from a distance, and it's not a pretty sight. Here is the fallen Eden, Lynch-style, where everyone has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge and been cast out of paradise to fuck, shoot, and act unnaturally before meeting untimely, gory ends.\n\n*/**** Image B Sound B+ (DD)/A (DTS) Extras B\n\nstarring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jerry Reed, Jackie Gleason\n\nscreenplay by James Lee Barrett and Charles Shyer & Alan Mandel\n\ndirected by Hal Needham\n\nby Travis Mackenzie Hoover One thing is inescapably true: Smokey and the Bandit was not aimed at people like me. Only the most casual, least demanding filmgoer need apply to this good-ol'-boy version of Vanishing Point–people with as much beer in them as possible, ready to laugh at cheap jokes and root for a speed demon. They are welcome to the movie, but the fact remains that anyone with even a scintilla of interest in film as art is pretty much left out in the cold. As I can hear a mountain of e-mail forming denouncing me for my perceived elitism, let me be perfectly clear: anyone in the market for Burt Reynolds driving fast and making Jackie Gleason apoplectic will find this the sort of thing that they like.\n\n**/**** Image B+ Sound B Commentary B+\n\nstarring Art Carney, Ellen Burstyn, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Larry Hagman\n\nscreenplay by Paul Mazursky and Josh Greenfeld\n\ndirected by Paul Mazursky\n\nby Alex Jackson I complain a lot about film criticism being reduced to archaeology, but I don't think I've ever seen anything quite as impenetrable along these lines as Paul Mazursky's 1974 sleeper Harry and Tonto. It never coheres, it never makes its point, and it never justifies its existence. You know Mr. Bernstein's anecdote about the girl in the white dress in Citizen Kane, or Marge Gunderson's drink with her old high school chum in Fargo–those nice little throwaway moments that haven't much to do with the actual movie? In Harry and Tonto, Mazursky gets rid of the \"actual movie\" and gives us nothing but throwaway moments. Yeah, it's that kind of film.\n\nTRANSAMERICA\n\n**/****\n\nstarring Felicity Huffman, Kevin Zegers, Fionnula Flanagan, Graham Greene\n\nwritten and directed by Duncan Tucker\n\nMRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS\n\n*½/****\n\nstarring Judi Dench, Bob Hoskins, Will Young, Christopher Guest\n\nscreenplay by Martin Sherman\n\ndirected by Stephen Frears\n\nby Walter Chaw Duncan Tucker makes his hyphenate debut with Transamerica, one of the first pictures distributed by the Weinsteins under their new aegis. Predictably, all the earmarks of the earnest indie genre Miramax blazed are cemented into place: it's over-written when it's not overreliant on a soundtrack of ethnically-cued melodies (the wood flute marks the appearance of an Indian, for instance) and folksy ballads (I challenge you not to 'pit up when a tune about a rose blooming accompanies our hero swapping his \"outie\" for an \"innie\"); narratively creaky; and hangs its hopes on its star, Felicity Huffman, to impose nuance where there is none. Huffman's performance being the sort of stunt in a minor independent film that plays fast and loose with smug liberal paternalism should guarantee her an Oscar nomination–and it can't hurt that another Leonardo DiCaprio doppelgänger arrives post-Michael Pitt in the form of Kevin Zegers, trailing a little pathos and a little inappropriate titillation on his thin shoulders.\n\n**/**** Image A- Sound A- Extras B\n\nstarring John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, James Brown, Cab Calloway\n\nscreenplay by Dan Aykroyd and John Landis\n\ndirected by John Landis\n\nby Travis Mackenzie Hoover Long before Quentin Tarantino would run a tear across the super soul sounds of the '70s, there was the strange case of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in the deadly \"Blues Brothers\" affair. Sitting somewhere at the low end of White Negro trickle-down, the Blues Brothers were two conspicuously white soul singers who made up for in enthusiasm what they lacked in talent–though their \"Saturday Night Live\" clowning conveniently omitted this bit of information, half-expecting us to take them seriously as they tumbled and caterwauled their way through various musical numbers. Where a true hipster would have meticulously re-created their favoured forms, Joliet Jake Blues (Belushi) and his brother Elwood (Aykroyd) had nothing but \"heart\" and \"sincerity\"–a nice way of saying they were rank amateurs doing primitive karaoke. They were compellingly frantic performers, but they weren't the blues and never would be.\n\n***½/****\n\nstarring Bill Murray, Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy\n\nwritten and directed by Jim Jarmusch\n\nby Walter Chaw I think that humour is a sharply-honed defense mechanism: something ingratiating in its ability to transcend taboo and thus, through laughter, enlist others in a secret club where the only law of membership is mutual transgression. And I think that comedians–the good ones–work from a well of demons deep and dire. It's no surprise to me that Robin Williams can actually manage a human performance in Dead Again, or that Jim Carrey can be brilliant in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, since so much of comedy is knowing what's acceptable and, more importantly, what's not. More to the point, it's no surprise that Bill Murray could refashion his career from the drunken bully of \"Saturday Night Live\" into this aging penitent, seeking absolution from some unnameable sin forever regenerating itself like a Promethean liver. It only took a couple of decades, but Murray has finally become Somerset Maugham's pilgrim Larry Darrell (whom he played in 1984's underestimated The Razor's Edge)–true maturity having a lot to do with the understanding that it doesn't take a shake-up as seismic as WWI to turn a man to blue moods. Often the first step in an existential journey is spurred by something as simple as a realization of how big of an asshole you used to be.\n\n**½/**** Image A Sound B- Extras A-\n\nstarring Jamie Bell, Josh Lucas, Dermot Mulroney, Devon Alan\n\nscreenplay by Joe Conway and David Gordon Green\n\ndirected by David Gordon Green\n\nby Walter Chaw David Gordon Green's collaboration with cinematographer Tim Orr has borne George Washington and All the Real Girls–fruit from the tree of Americana, nourished at its roots by the twilit legacy of Terrence Malick. Taking its cue from another source, Malick's progenitor Charles Laughton and Laughton's only film as a director, Night of the Hunter, Green's latest, Undertow, just isn't as good as his previous work: it's too sunny at its end, too mannered in its middle, and it fails to live up to the standards both it sets for itself and the limited oeuvre of Green sets for it.\n\n**½/**** Image A- Sound B+ Extras B+\n\nstarring Ellen Burstyn, Kris Kristofferson, Billy Green Bush, Diane Ladd\n\nscreenplay by Robert Getchell\n\ndirected by Martin Scorsese\n\nby Bill Chambers The zeitgeist made Martin Scorsese and his mentor John Cassavetes artistically simpatico in 1974, when the two helmed \"women's pictures\" independent of each other's counsel. It was the beginning of women's lib, and Warner hoped to corner the market via Ellen Burstyn and her pet project Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, while it would seem that with his brilliant A Woman Under the Influence, Cassavetes just wanted to say something hopeful about marriage to counter the prevailing propaganda. Both pictures were demonized in certain feminist circles for yoking their heroines to knights in tarnished armour, but in the case of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, they were preaching to the compromised.\n\n**½/**** Image A- Sound B+\n\nstarring Barbara Hershey, David Carradine, Barry Primus, Bernie Casey\n\nscreenplay by Joyce H. Corrington & John William Corrington, based on Sisters of the Road by Bertha Thompson, as told to Ben L. Reitman\n\ndirected by Martin Scorsese\n\nby Bill Chambers Although a Martin Scorsese retrospective could easily survive the absence of Boxcar Bertha, the film is a cornerstone of the director's filmography: Without it, there is conceivably no The Last Temptation of Christ–Bertha herself, Barbara Hershey, introduced Scorsese to the Nikos Kazantzakis source novel during production–and no Mean Streets. Because he'd been toiling away on the Hollywood fringe after getting fired from his would-be sophomore effort, 1970's The Honeymoon Killers, for shooting everything in master (an experiment he would repeat to great acclaim with The King of Comedy), Scorsese agreed to helm AIP's umpteenth Bonnie and Clyde wannabe, an in-name-only sequel to the drive-in sensation Bloody Mama (which incidentally starred his future muse, Robert De Niro). \"You just spent a year of your life making a piece of shit,\" went John Cassavetes's immortal response to the results, a critique not so much of the work itself as of Scorsese's decision to play the hired gun. Thus aborted his mission to position himself as one of the California film brats conquering the industry, as Cassavetes's tough-love approach spurred him to return to New York and resurrect the idea for Season of the Witch, a thematic follow-up to Who's That Knocking At My Door that eventually became Mean Streets.\n\n½*/**** Image B Sound B\n\nstarring Cher, Barbara London, Stephen Whittaker, Tom Nolan\n\nscreenplay by Sonny Bono\n\ndirected by Alessio de Paola\n\nby Travis Mackenzie Hoover There is nothing more dangerous than a cuddly celebrity with avant-garde pretensions. The idea of a cheesy popular entertainer pouring his heart into something \"serious\" and \"artistic\" is wrong on so many levels: not only does it usually show him up as ignorant of the good work in the field he wants to hijack, but it also denigrates the deflationary appeal of what he actually does well. Normally the result just falls flat on its face, but with a little flamboyance–as in the case of William Shatner's \"Transformed Man\" album–the effort can result in a camp howler of uncommon magnitude. That would likewise be the fate of Chastity, a Sonny Bono-penned opus meant to endow his then-paramour Cher with the gravitas she clearly lacked on their variety show. With every (drunken, staggering) motion it takes towards significance, Chastity gets further and further away from it. We're talking planets.\n\n½*/**** Image A Sound A- Extras C+\n\nstarring Cedric the Entertainer, Bow Wow, Vanessa Williams, Shannon Elizabeth\n\nscreenplay by Todd R. Jones & Earl Richey Jones\n\ndirected by Christopher Erskin\n\nby Bill Chambers Big fan of National Lampoon's Vacation that I am, I was actually intrigued by the prospect of its central characters undergoing a racial inversion. On their trip to a mecca of family fun known as Wally World, the Caucasian Griswolds left their suburban cocoon only to discover how socially ill-equipped they were for the rest of an increasingly stratified America–an apologue in the vein of The Wizard of Oz that's more than un-PC: it's anthropological; a black retread hewed to its line has the potential to be far more applicable to the African-American experience than, say, The Wiz. Unfortunately, while National Lampoon's Vacation was scripted by John Hughes, the Reagan era's premier commentator on class relations, the creators of something called \"C-Bear and Jamal\" wrote Johnson Family Vacation. Maybe their lack of pedigree is irrelevant, but so is the film, which we can only generously call a pale imitation of National Lampoon's Vacation. After the opening credits, I wished the movie had had the wit to rib its derivative genesis with a parody of National Lampoon's Vacation's signature song (\"Ease on Down the Holiday Road\"–isn't it obvious?). By the end of the movie, I wished it had wit."
