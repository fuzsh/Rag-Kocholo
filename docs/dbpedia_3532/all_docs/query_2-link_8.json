Walthall) is forced to sell her when he loses everything in a poker game. Several of the era’s most famous racehorses make appearances, including the legendary champion thoroughbred Man o’ War.",

        "text": "[14 Ford Films I haven't seen leaving Criterion Channel in June Attempt. Film 5/14]\n\n\"Those creatures known as humans\"\n\nThe life story of thoroughbred racehorse Virginia's Future as narrated from the unique vantage point of the horse herself. There is something emotionally compelling about the helplessness of animals under our protection, and this is an example of how directly the changing vicissitudes of humans impact them. After Virginia's Fortune breaks her leg in a high profile race, her master Beaumont (Henry B. Walthall), who bet everything on the outcome, loses control of his estate, including the horses.\n\nWhat follows is an often sweet, sometimes tragic and cruel tale. Using the vantage point of the horse lends the narrative some extra…\n\nYes, I did watch this racehorse movie because the Kentucky Derby is tomorrow. It is what has to be John Ford's strangest movie; you see, the tale itself revolving around the ups and downs of a filly horse's life and its original owners isn't that peculiar. It probably isn't a spoiler for me to state that this horse ends up having multiple owners. What IS bizarre: often, there are intertitles which provide the thoughts of the animal! That's right, in essence talking equine. It's all pretty weird in an otherwise nice, charming story where the lead quadruped has a sweet relationship w/ a young girl. Of course, there are the regrettable aspects of a key horse being named “Confederate” and…\n\nKentucky Pride feels like a perfect representation of the challenges inherent in appreciating John Ford's work during the modern era. Narrated by a horse, the film is made with a wonderfully light touch, incorporating considerable humor within its story of triumph over adversity, as the narrator, Virginia's Future, survives hard labor to see her daughter win the race in which she herself had suffered a career ending injury.*\n\nAlongside clever used footage of horses, as well as a very well trained equine star, Ford's human cast, top to bottom, is stellar, particularly Henry B. Walthall, ten years after his lead role in Birth of a Nation, as Beaumont, the breeder whose struggles mirror that of the horse on which he…\n\n[56]\n\nA massive wave of panic washed over me when, about thirty seconds into this early Ford picture, I realize it was truly “silent,” i.e., not even accompanied by a score. Unless possibly delivered by Brakhage or Deren, I don’t do well amid the total absence of sound. I get too distracted - I begin focusing on weird shit, like the expansion of my home’s ducts booming or the embarrassing sound of my own heavy breathing as I’m stuffing my face with taco-flavored Doritos (the best kind). I’m not the world’s strictest purist, so in an effort not to spend the next seventy minutes in agonizing misery, I got my headphones and queued up Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s YANQUI U.X.O. No…"
