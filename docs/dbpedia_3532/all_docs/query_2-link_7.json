While spending a vacation along the coast of Maine, Robert paints a picture of one of the daughters of a fisherman (Saville). Some time later the body of the girl is found in the sea, and Robert is accused of being the cause of her death. Marion refuses to have anything more to do with him, and Robert drifts from bad to worse. He becomes the victim of some thieves who leave a stolen wallet on him, and he is sent to prison. During a prisoner uprising he escapes, but also saves the life of the Governor (MacGregor) who had been visiting the prison. Robert swims out to a small island and walks to the lighthouse where he finds the keeper ill and unable to keep his signal on. Robert flashes a light during a storm and thus protects the ships. He decides to return to prison, and on arrival finds a pardon awaiting him. Upon release, he returns to his old haunts and passes the Governor on the street. In a barroom, he is the subject of jests until he finally starts telling his story. He paints Marion's picture on the floor. Meanwhile, the Governor is at a dinner party and through a coincidence relates a story that makes Marion convinced that Robert has finally been found. Her brother confesses his guilt regarding the Fisherman's daughter which exonerates Robert. They go to him and bring him back, and in a while he has resumed his former life and is happy with Marion.\n\nCast\n\n· Henry B.

It was Ford's first major film, in part because the hastily planned production went over budget, as Fox was making a hurried response to the success of another studio's western. In 2011, this film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. [2]\n\nPlot\n\nThe film is about the construction of the American first transcontinental railroad. It depicts Irish, Italian, and Chinese immigrants, as well as African Americans, as the men who did the backbreaking work that made this feat possible. The primary villain is an unscrupulous businessman who masquerades as a renegade Cheyenne. It culminates with the scene of driving of the golden spike at Promontory Summit on May 10, 1869. There is a note in the title before this scene that the two original locomotives from the 1869 event are used in the film, although this is false - both engines (Union Pacific No. 119 and Jupiter) were scrapped before 1910. Main stars were George O'Brien and Madge Bellamy.\n\nCast\n\n· George O'Brien as Davy Brandon\n\n· Madge Bellamy as Miriam Marsh\n\n· Charles Edward Bull as Abraham Lincoln\n\n· Cyril Chadwick as Peter Jesson\n\n· Will Walling as Thomas Marsh\n\n· Francis Powers as Sergeant Slattery\n\n· J.

'Buffalo Bill' Cody\n\n· Fred Kohler as Deroux / Bauman\n\n· James A. Marcus as Judge Haller (credited as James Marcus)\n\n· Gladys Hulette as Ruby\n\n· Chief John Big Tree as Cheyenne Chief (uncredited)\n\nLegacy\n\nIn December 2011, The Iron Horse was selected for inclusion in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry.[3] In choosing the film, the Registry said that The Iron Horse \"introduced to American and world audiences a reverential, elegiac mythology that has influenced many subsequent Westerns.\"[3]\n\nAmong the extras used in the Central Pacific sequences were several Chinese men playing coolies who worked on the railroad. They were in fact retired Central Pacific Railroad employees who had helped build the first transcontinental railroad through the Sierras, who came out to participate in the filming as a lark.[4]\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in the following list:\n\n· 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: Nominated Western Film[5]\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe film has a 78% rating in Rotten Tomatoes.[6]\n\nHome media\n\nThe film was released on DVD in America in its full-length US version (accompanied by the truncated UK version). A 2011 release of The Iron Horse on DVD in the UK included both the US and International/UK versions of the picture, and a half-hour video-essay about the film by author and critic Tag Gallagher. The 'international' version includes some variant shots and uses different names for some supporting characters; it also carries a dedication to the British railway engineer George Stephenson.[7]\n\nNear the end of the film, it is stated that the actual \"Jupiter\" and \"UP 116\" were used in the scene. Besides incorrectly identifying the \"UP 119\" as the \"UP 116\", both engines had been scrapped 21 and 15 years earlier. Of interest, however, what appears to be the Central Pacific's \"C.P. Huntington\", now on display in Sacramento, California, is being manhandled up a steep grade on a sledge made of logs.\n\nNovelization\n\nStarting in the early 1920s the publishing house Grosset and Dunlap crafted a deal with the prominent Hollywood studios to issue novelizations of their major, original releases and among those was The Iron Horse (1924, 329pp). The author was Edwin C. Hill, then a journalist, who would become a prominent radio broadcaster, best remembered for a show called The Human Side of the News.\n\nReferences\n\n1. \"Progressive Silent Film List: The Iron Horse\".

Walthall (who had previously played the Little Colonel in D. W. Griffith's controversial 1915 film The Birth of a Nation).[1] It is among Ford's lesser-known works, but has been praised for sweetness and charm and its beautiful depiction of the life of horses and the relationship between the protagonist and his daughter.[2] Several well-known thoroughbred racehorses appear in the film, including the legendary Man o' War.[1][3] A print of Kentucky Pride is in the Museum of Modern Art film archive.[3][4]\n\nPlot\n\nThe plot concerns Beaumont, a horse breeder with a penchant for gambling, who is down on his luck.[1] After losing at poker and being forced to give up several of his horses to cover his losses, Beaumont bets it all and loses again when his horse, Virginia's Future, suddenly falls and breaks a leg while leading the pack in a critical race.[1][2] Beaumont's selfish wife tells the horse's trainer, Mike Donovan, to kill the injured horse, and abandons Beaumont for Greve Carter, a well-to-do neighbor. Beaumont also loses his relationship with Virginia,[1] his daughter from his previous marriage. Beaumont and Donovan manage to save Virginia's Future, and she births a colt[1] (or a filly[2]) named Confederacy, but his financial troubles force him to sell off both the colt and the mare. Confederacy is mistreated by his new owner, a foreign junk dealer, and Virginia's Future is forced into hard labor as a pack horse. But when Confederacy is later entered to run in the Futurity, ridden by Mike Donovan's son Danny,[1][2] Beaumont gathers everything he can and bets it all again. This time he wins. He is reunited with his daughter and buys back the colt, giving it a good life in the pasture.[1][2]\n\nCast\n\n· Gertrude Astor as Mrs. Beaumont, the selfish second wife of Mr. Beaumont\n\n· Peaches Jackson as Beaumont's daughter Virginia\n\n· J.

A \"backstage drama\",[1] the film is about a Shakespearean actor and a woman from a knife-throwing act. The film was considered to be a lost film,[2] but in 2009 a print was discovered in the New Zealand Film Archive.[1]\n\nIt is considered to be the first Ford film to show some influence of German director F. W. Murnau, who began working at Fox Studios in 1926. From Murnau, Ford learned how to use forced perspectives and chiaroscuro lighting, which the American director then integrated into his own more naturalistic and direct filmmaking style.[1]\n\nCast\n\n· Nancy Nash as Gertie Ryan\n\n· Earle Foxe as Eric Brasingham\n\n· Grant Withers as Jack La Velle\n\n· Lydia Yeamans Titus as Miss Hattie Breckenbridge\n\n· Raymond Hitchcock as Star Boarder\n\n· Emile Chautard as Campbell Mandare\n\n· Ted McNamara as Callahan and Callahan\n\n· Sammy Cohen as Callahan and Callahan\n\n· Judy King as Sister Team\n\n· Lillian Worth as Sister Team\n\n· Jane Winton as Soubrette\n\n· Harry A.

The cache was found to include astonishing treasures of at least 75 American silent films unknown to exist in the United States, including a complete tinted nitrate print of Upstream and a trailer for another lost John Ford feature, Strong Boy (1929).[3]\n\nThe New Zealand Film Archive turned out to have many American films that had never been shipped back to the United States after they ran in theaters.[1] The films were supposed to be destroyed at the end of their distribution run, but some were stashed away instead.[4] Upstream was considered so important that, unlike other films discovered in the New Zealand archive, it was restored in New Zealand.[4]\n\n20th Century Fox, a descendant company of the studio that made the movie, supported the preservation of the film in collaboration with the National Film Preservation Foundation and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences film archive. Upstream received a \"repremiere\" at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in September 2010.[1] and a European screening at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone Italy in October 2010. Michael Mortilla wrote music for the AMPAS screening, and Donald Sosin for the Pordenone event.\n\nOnly 15% of Ford's silent films are known to have survived as of 2010.[4]\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Rida Johnson Young had invented Mother Machree in the stage show Barry of Ballymoore in 1910. John Wayne had a minor role in the film.[1]\n\nCast\n\n· Belle Bennett as Mother Machree (Ellen McHugh)\n\n· Neil Hamilton as Brian McHugh, aka Brian van Studdiford\n\n· Victor McLaglen as The Giant of Kilkenny (Terence O'Dowd)\n\n· Constance Howard as Edith Cutting\n\n· Philippe De Lacy as Brian McHugh (as a child)\n\n· Ted McNamara as The Harper of Wexford\n\n· Billy Platt as The Dwarf of Munster (Pips) (billed as William Platt)\n\n· Eulalie Jensen as Rachel van Studdiford\n\n· Pat Somerset as Bobby de Puyster\n\n· John Wayne (bit player)\n\nProduction\n\nThe production of the film was a protracted one, the film was originally announced by Fox publicity in June 1926 with filming slated for that September. In November, it was announced that it would be premiered on December 12, 1926, tying in with the marketing campaign of the music and discs of the title song, however its release was ultimately delayed, since Fox had plans to release it with a Movietone synchronised music score and sound effects track.\n\nRelease\n\nIn May 1927, it was privately previewed at a Fox sales convention in Atlantic City, along with Sunrise and 7th Heaven (1927) as a showcase of the new Movietone process, and that September a silent version was previewed at the Astoria Theatre in London. By the beginning of 1928, the delays were amounting to around $750,000, and its release was deferred until January 22, 1928 when it was premiered at the Globe Theatre in New York, its delay owing to the release schedule of the Fox Movietone features.[2] The film is also notable for containing the first synchronous sound sequence using the Movietone process in a feature film, a short scene featuring Brian McHugh (Neil Hamilton) singing the title song \"Mother Machree,\" which featured in the original stage show.\n\nPreservation Status\n\nOnly four reels out of seven of this movie survive. Incomplete prints exist (reels one, two and five) in the Library of Congress film archive; and in the UCLA Film and Television Archive film archive (reels two, five and seven); reels three, four and six are presumed lost.\n\nReferences\n\n1. \"Progressive Silent Film List: Mother Machree\".

It is based on a novel by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne. It was adapted by Philip Klein with scenarios by Marion Orth. The film is also notable for containing the first confirmed appearance by John Wayne in a John Ford film.[1]\n\nWhile stationed in Algiers Commandant Denis Hogan (Victor McLaglen) receives a letter containing bad news and requests that he be allowed to return to his home country of Ireland, where he is a wanted man. In Ireland, Baron James O'Brien (Hobart Bosworth) is told by his doctor that he has no more than a month to live. He decides to marry off his only daughter Connaught (June Collyer) to a socialite, John D'Arcy (Earle Foxe) despite her love of childhood friend Dermot McDermot (Larry Kent).\n\nHogan returns to Ireland and disguises himself as a holy man. On his way to the O'Brien's house he is recognised by a gatekeeper, whom he reveal his intentions to kill a man to. Hogan meets Dermot McDermot and the three men witness the lights of Glenmalure's chapel being lit, signifying a wedding is taking place. At this time a group of soldiers ask the gate keeper if he has seen Hogan. Later that night, after Connaught and D'Arcy have been wed, the Baron dies. On the night of his funeral Hogan sneaks about the grounds of Hangman's House and is spotted by D'Arcy. D'Arcy is startled by the appearance of Hogan. At bedtime D'Arcy tries to sleep with Connaught but she rejects his advances.\n\nA community race is held on St. Stephen's Day and Connaught's horse The Bard is due to race. The horse's jockey goes missing just before the race because of interference from D'Arcy who has bet against the horse. Dermot is required to jockey the horse and he wins the race leading a drunken D'Arcy to shoot The Bard. D'Arcy is ostracised by the community because of this. Hogan is arrested at the race. At night Dermot and D'Arcy meet in a pub where D'Arcy reveals that he had an affair with Hogan's sister. Dermot gives D'Arcy money to leave Ireland and threatens him that if he ever sees him again he will kill him.\n\nHogan escapes from prison and a gunfight erupts between his men and the guards. Later Dermot and Connaught visit Hogan's hideout and Hogan reveals that his sister died following D'Arcy's desertion. Connaught returns to Hangman's House to discover that D'Arcy has returned. After a struggle she flees to Dermot's house. Hogan and Dermot go to Hangman's House and confront D'Arcy. During a fight between the men a fire breaks out and burns down the house. Hogan and Dermot escape but D'Arcy falls to his death as a balcony collapses. Connaught and Dermot see Hogan off at the port as he returns to Algiers. Connaught gives Hogan a kiss and Dermot shakes his hands and thanks him. Connaught and Dermot walk away together as Hogan watches them.\n\nCast\n\n· Victor McLaglen as Citizen Denis Hogan\n\n· June Collyer as Connaught \"Conn\" O'Brien\n\n· Earle Fox as John D'Arcy\n\n· Larry Kent as Dermot McDermot\n\n· Hobart Bosworth as Lord Justice O'Brien\n\n· John Wayne as Horse Race Spectator/Condemned Man in Flashback (uncredited)\n\n· Brian Desmond Hurst as Horse Race Spectator and witness to the horse shooting (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\nThe film began production in January 1928 and took seven weeks to film.[2]\n\nReception\n\nThe film received positive reviews; Wilfred Beaton of Film Spectator called it \"the finest program picture ever turned out by a studio\". In particular he praised the photography which he said \"almost outdoes for sheer beauty the shots in Street Angel and Sunrise\".[3] Variety shared this opinion by proclaiming the film had \"some of the most striking touches of composition seen on the screen since those swampland shots in Sunrise, which they often resemble.\" [4] However the film was not a box office success as Fox Film Corporation did not promote the film.[5]\n\nDVD Release\n\nThe film was released on DVD in North America by Fox on December 4, 2007. The film can be obtained three different ways:\n\n· In the Ford at Fox - The Collection box set which is a 21 disc collection containing most of the films John Ford made at Fox.\n\n· In the Ford At Fox Collection: John Ford's Silent Epics which also contains Just Pals, Four Sons, The Iron Horse and 3 Bad Men.\n\n· As a separate release also containing 3 Bad Men on the opposite side of the disc.\n\nThe DVD begins with a disclaimer stating that the film has been brought to DVD using the best surviving elements possible.
