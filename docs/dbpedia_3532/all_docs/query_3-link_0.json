It is the first appearance of Warner Oland as Charlie Chan. Part of the long-running Charlie Chan series, it was based on the 1930 novel of the same title by Earl Derr Biggers. It is now considered a lost film;[1] however, Fox simultaneously filmed a Spanish-language version which was released under the title Eran Trece—There Were Thirteen—and this version survives.\n\nCharlie Chan tries to solve the murder of a wealthy American found dead in a London hotel room. Settings include London, Nice, France, San Remo, Honolulu and Hong Kong.\n\nWarner Oland as Charlie Chan\n\nJohn Garrick as Mark Kenaway\n\nMarguerite Churchill as Pamela Potter\n\nWarren Hymer as Max Minchin\n\nMarjorie White as Sadie\n\nC.
