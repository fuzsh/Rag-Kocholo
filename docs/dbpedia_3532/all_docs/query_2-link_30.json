A famed fortune-teller and the most desired woman in Paris, Zareda cruelly manipulates her suitors for her own selfish ends.

While traveling with Owen through southern California, Mem senses his true nature and jumps from the train. She staggers through the barren desert, is saved by a film company making a sheik picture, and joins the company’s production as an extra. She soon goes to Hollywood, determined to become an actress. She receives a break from Frank Claymore (Richard Dix), director of the company that rescued her, and wins the adoration of filmgoers. Frank and the company’s leading man, Tom Holby (Frank Mayo), both woo her but Mem, bitterly aware that she is already married, evades their affections to avoid scandal. Owen recognizes Mem on the big screen and tracks her down in Hollywood. In the film’s climactic conclusion, lightning sets the company’s circus tent ablaze and chaos erupts; Owen, attempting to shove Frank into the oscillating blades of a wind machine, kills himself when he jumps in front of it to protect Mem. Released from her marriage to Owen, Mem takes up with Frank. (Barbara La Marr appears in the role of the company’s vamp, Leva Lemaire.
