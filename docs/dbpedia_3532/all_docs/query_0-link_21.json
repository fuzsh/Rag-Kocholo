        "text": "This is a collection of newspaper and trade journal news items, credits, home video releases, and other tidbits regarding the Willows Park Studio in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nUnder the aegis of Kenneth J. Bishop, the studio produced 14 quota pictures for the U.K. market between 1933â€“1937.\n\nThe news items will tell the story, beginning with those announcing studios in Vancouver and Victoria that were never built, all proposed to take advantage of the Cinematograph Films Act of 1927. The legislation allowed films made in the Dominion, meeting certain criteria, to be classed as British.\n\nThe page ends by documenting Bishop's previous known work in the film business.\n\nFilms are presented in order of production.\n\nFilm Daily, March 16, 1927:\n\nCanada Expects Units\n\nOttawaÃ¢Â€Â”Passage of the proposed British quota law would result in establishment of important producing units in Canada, in the opinion of the Canadian Dept. of Trade and Commerce, under whose auspices the government's studio is operated. The law requiring that pictures must be made on British soil to come under the classification of British pictures would result in an influx of American companies to Canada, it is believed. Ray Peck, director of the government studio, now is in Hollywood discussing Canadian producing possibilities with executives of several companies.\n\nMotion Picture News, March 25, 1927:\n\nBritish Quota Law Looms\n\nMeasure Introduced in Parliament Starts at 7Â½ Per Cent., Rising to 25 in 1935\n\nAn unexpected angle to the British film quota situation developed this week when the Labor Party decided to oppose the bill on the ground that it \"compels British traders to supply goods irrespective of their comparative merit and the demands of their customers.\"\n\nThe President of the Board of Trade announced in a speech, however, that nothing would induce him to withdraw the measure.\n\nThe bill has been introduced in the House of Commons, and provides for a quota of seven and one-half per cent. of British films for the first year, advancing to 25 per cent, in 1935, with a yearly increase of two and one-half per cent. This applies to distributors, and exhibitors will have the same percentages, starting one year later.\n\nBlind booking and block booking are both prohibited under the measure, as was anticipated by the trade.\n\nA British film is to be one with British actors, author and atmosphere predominating. Scenes may not be taken outside the British Empire without special permission.\n\nTrade paper reports indicate lively opposition to the terms of the measure among exhibitors and the more conservative members of Parliament, with the probability of amendments being introduced. Exhibitors point out that no other British industry is compelled to operate under such conditions, and that many of the terms of the measure are unworkable.\n\nOne indirect result of the present situation was the formation this week of British Incorporated Pictures, Ltd., a million-pound company headed by Ralph J. Pugh, formerly with British First National, and Rupert Mason, a Lancashire cotton manufacturer. Prominent British authors and leading figures in the theatre and the world of art are enrolled in the venture, it is stated.\n\nSupporters in Canada of a film quota law in Great Britain are enthusiastic over the prospect of the adoption of the legislation by the Imperial Parliament, particularly because of the requirement that 75 per cent. of salaries to be paid by British producing companies must go to persons domiciled within the British Empire or to British subjects, exclusive of the salaries to the director and one star of an individual picture.\n\nOfficials of the Canadian Department of Trade and Commerce, under whose auspices the Canadian Government Motion Picture Studio is operated at Ottawa, are of the opinion that the new British law would lead to the establishment of important film producing companies in the Dominion of Canada because of the proximity of Canada to the United States, these being companies more or less affiliated with big United States producers.\n\nRay Peck, director of the Canadian Government studio, is at present in Los Angeles, where he has been discussing Canadian producing possibilities with executives of several companies.\n\nFilm Daily, April 24, 1927:\n\nCanadian Producer\n\nHollywoodÃ¢Â€Â”Nils Chrisander, Swedish director, has been signed to direct the first production to be made at Vancouver by Canadian National Cinema Studios, formed by a number of prominent Canadian and British financiers and headed by Sir Robert Kindserly [Kindserley], president of the Bank of England. Lord Beaverbrook is prominent among backers. The firm does not intend to compete with American companies, but intends to employ American methods in production of British films in anticipation of passage of the quota law. Eight hundred acres have been acquired for studios at Vancouver.\n\nHollywood Vagabond, June 23, 1927:\n\nPromoters Flock to Canada 'Film Rush'\n\nTalk Big Money In Movie Frenzy\n\nVancouver and Victoria, those otherwise sedate cities of British Columbia, are in the throes of excitement as wild as that which attended the California gold rush of '49. The movies are comin'! The movies are comin'!\n\nPromoters from Hollywood and elsewhere have found western Canada a fertile spot to promote all kinds of wild and fanciful \"second Hollywoods,\" and are busy talking in terms of millions of dollars.\n\nOne movie director, lately of Hollywood, has informed the Canadians that he \"quit Hollywood, after being offered a salary of $30,000 a week so he could come to Canada and make \"clean pictures!\" The pictures he made in Hollywood were nothing extraordinary and his salary was far from one-tenth of what he claims.\n\nOne, Mr. William Lee Sherill, formerly of Hollywood, is trying to promote a $500,000 studio in Victoria and the staid \"Daily Colonist\" of that city has burst forth in screaming headlines with the news that Victoria is planning to put $250,000 into the project.\n\nIt might be wise for the Canadians to check up with the Hays association before becoming so liberal with their millions.\n\nFilm Daily, July 20, 1927:\n\nVictoria Makes Bid\n\nVictoria, B.C.Ã¢Â€Â”This city may make a bid for leadership as the production center of the British Empire, and a race with Vancouver may develop. Claude Fleming of Australia and W. L. Sherrill, formerly of the Frohman Amusement Co., are promoters of a $500,000 studio to be built here. The city council is reported to invest $250,000, the remainder is to be raised in England. The project is designed as the first unit of a studio city, to produce for a market throughout the empire when the quota is passed. Recently plans for a studio at Vancouver was announced.\n\nFilm Daily, August 4, 1927:\n\nWEST CANADA BIDS FOR BRITISH FILM CENTER\n\nVancouverÃ¢Â€Â”Western Canada has become the stamping ground of various production enterprises, due largely to an agitation for films made in the British Empire. The quota discussion has had an influence on the situation.\n\nOne of the outstanding projects is that of the Lions' Gate Cinema Studios, local firm which is identified as the First National Cine Studios Syndicate. This company recently purchased studio property in West Vancouver.\n\nA British producing syndicate has been busy in Victoria, where ratepayers have voted in favor of municipal support for the venture to the extent of $200,000, providing English distributors and exhibitors provide $400,000. This is the Fleming organization.\n\nMatheson Lang interests in London (England) have secured an option on the magnificent Dunsmuir residence and gardens at Victoria for picture purposes. Representatives of Lang declare that this company is privately controlled and financed.\n\nFilm Daily, August 24, 1927:\n\nCanadian Production Studio Is Organized\n\nOttawaÃ¢Â€Â”The Lions Gate Cinema Studios, Ltd., with headquarters in Vancouver, has been organized under a Canadian Federal charter for the purpose of producing and distributing Canadian pictures. Capital consists of 500,000 shares of preferred at $10 par value and 500,000 shares common no par. The company has purchased studio property in Vancouver West.\n\nFilm Daily, December 23, 1927:\n\nQuota Bill Becomes Law in England; Curtails Market for American Films\n\nAll Distributors Made to Include British Films on Programs\n\nLondon (By Cable)Ã¢Â€Â”The Cinematograph Films Act, 1927â€”commonly known as the quota billâ€”received the king's assent yesterday and is, therefore, a law. It becomes effective Jan. 1, 1928 and will continue in force until Sept. 30, 1938.\n\nFilm Daily, January 23, 1928:\n\nFILMS MADE IN CANADA MAY MEET QUOTA LAW\n\nLondon (By Cable)Ã¢Â€Â”While no definition has been officially secured from the British Board of Trade, it is understood here that a picture made in Canada will be considered British-made and, therefore, eligible for distribution under the quota law. All other clauses of the Films Bill must, however, be met.\n\nThere has been considerable speculation in American producing circles regarding the possibilities of making quota pictures in Canada, especially Vancouver in view of its comparative proximity to Hollywood. The regulations governing production factors are many.\n\nFilm Daily, May 18, 1928:\n\nPlan Dog Pictures\n\nEwart Adamson and Garnett Weston, writers, plan to produce a series of dog pictures at Victoria, B.C., it is reported.\n\nNote: This item is probably related to producer Sam Bischoff announcing in Film Daily, May 1, 1928, that he would produce six action melodramas featuring the dog \"Silver Streak,\" who had been starred in a number of previous films by the Hollywood producer. Only one of the six announced films was known to be made, \"Code of the Air,\" and was probably filmed at the Tec-Art Studios in Hollywood where Bischoff Productions was based.\n\nSam Bischoff had plans for producing quota pictures in Canada for British Gaumont, notably \"The Wilderness Patrol\" starring Bill Cody, which evidence suggests was never made.\n\nIronically, for a short time Bischoff was studio manager of Columbia Pictures, then in late 1929 became a production supervisor for the company.\n\nFilm Daily, July 8, 1928:\n\nPlans Prepared for New Studio at Victoria, B.C.\n\nVictoria. B.C.Ã¢Â€Â”Sam Maclure, architect, has prepared plans for the studio buildings here for Pacific Pictures, Ltd., of which Alfred Hustwick, formerly with Paramount, is the promoter. Hustwick secured the site for the studio at a nominal figure from the City of Victoria.\n\nPlans call for erection of three buildings of stucco construction, the largest of which is 65 by 100 feet. The stage will have a width of 100 feet with the roof trusses 40 feet from the floor. There will be 25 dressing rooms. The projection and film cutting rooms will be of fireproof construction. Eric C. Clarkson, formerly with General Pictures, Hollywood, is associated with the undertaking.\n\nFilm Daily, July 8, 1928:\n\nMay Produce in Canada\n\nLondonÃ¢Â€Â”Production in Canada is understood planned by Gaumont.\n\nFilm Daily, January 27, 1929:\n\nPropose Canadian Studio\n\nLondonÃ¢Â€Â”Richard Maitland Edwards who has been studying the possibilities of erecting a studio at Vancouver, is expected to arrive here to secure additional financial capital. In a recent letter to his father he stated that a Canadian financial company was interested to the extent of $125,000.\n\nFilm Daily, February 3, 1929:\n\nAnother Studio Promotion is Reported at Vancouver\n\nVancouverÃ¢Â€Â”This city is once more hearing reports of a studio for the production of pictures \"to qualify under the British Quota Plan.\" An actor from Hollywood is said to be the prime mover in the project. Several promotions have been started in Vancouver and also in Victoria in recent years but, as yet, there is no actual sign of a studio. Some months ago two stock salesmen were hailed to court because of their activities in selling shares in a projected film producing enterprise.\n\nFilm Daily, September 9, 1930:\n\nLondon Backing Sought for Canadian Industry\n\nOttawaÃ¢Â€Â”Mrs. Carolyn Bayfield, financially interested in the British Picture Producers, which has a studio in Victoria, is here to urge government officials to sponsor producing activities in Canada on a big scale. She says she will go to London to seek English capital for production and theaters.\n\nFilm Daily, July 11, 1930:\n\nNew Project Will Aim to Solve British Quota Problem\n\nAn ambitious program of talking features, shorts, serials and news, soon will be launched by the Canadian-American Talking Picture Studios, Ltd., a $1,000,000 corporation of Montreal, according to Ray Jackson, managing director, who recently returned from Europe, where he spent three years making pictures for Universal, Terra United Artists and British Screen Productions. Jackson said his organization will begin to utilize within 60 days its 500 acres along the St. Lawrence River, particularly as a means of overcoming the British quota.\n\n\"We have available the necessary equipment, studios and locations for American producers and distributors with British capital that are necessary to make pictures,\" Jackson told THE FILM DAILY.\n\n\"Under our plan, American companies will be in a position to use American writers, to supervise production, furnish the directors, stars and principal artists including cameramen and leading technician staffs.\n\n\"I have reason to believe that in view of the tariff bill just passed, the English will increase their quota on American films to 50 percent. This will not be done so much as a reprisal but because Britain feels that it deserves to take its place in a competitive market in the film industry and as a means of protecting her own producer-distributors.\n\n\"I feel that our Canadian company is the answer to the entire question, as conditions there are more ideal for making pictures than in England. Besides there will be a great saving in expense. Millions of dollars have been lost by American producers as a result of the English law passed in 1927 requiring that 10 per cent of the production be made there. Very few of these films made in England are ever shown in this country, thus practically making this much production a total loss. In Canada all this can be overcome.\"\n\nExhibitors Herald-World, October 11, 1930:\n\nNew Producing Firm Organizes in Canada; Capital Is $1,000,000\n\n(Special to the Herald-World) MONTREAL, Oct. 9.Ã¢Â€Â”A new producing company, known as Canadian-American Talking Picture Studios, Ltd., has been organized to produce pictures in the Dominion which will meet the requirements of the British quota law.\n\nConstruction has already begun on a studio at Chambly Basin, Quebec. It is proposed during the coming year to make six features, one serial and 24 shorts at the plant. The company hopes to realize a profit of $495,000 from these productions, it is understood.\n\nThe capitalization is to be $1,000,000, financed by an issue of 100,000 shares of stock at $10 par value.\n\nDr. W. I. Whitehead of Montreal is president of the company. John Barry, fiscal agent here, is vice president and Ray Jackson is managing director.\n\nMotion Picture News, July 12, 1930:\n\nBuild Canadian Studio for U.K. Quota Pictures\n\nBuilding of a talking picture studio, designed primarily for production of British quota films, is under way at Montreal, according to Ray Jackson, who is managing director of the enterprise, which will operate as United Talking Pictures, Ltd. He plans production of two films this year. The company, says Jackson, who is in New York arranging for recording equipment, plans to co-operate with all American producers. A canteen, which will accomodate [sic] 250 persons, now is under construction.\n\nThe new studio is to be located 20 miles outside Montreal upon a former golf course. A proposed clubhouse is to cost $150,000, according to Jackson. Site of the new production plant will cost a reputed $300,000.\n\nProduction of quota films in England is unfeasible in Jackson's opinion. He believes the cost of taking American production staffs to Europe is prohibitive and says the antagonism against both British and American films is a stumbling block. This is due, he declares, to the \"blow up\" of British films, as a result of the American talker development. A few years ago, he says, $24,000,000 was raised by popular subscription for the rehabilitation of the British film industry. Because no market for the pictures was developed, the British public is considerably peeved at films generally, Jackson says. As a result, considerable difficulty is experienced by British producers in filming scenes, Jackson asserts.\n\nFilm Daily, January 12, 1931:\n\nNew Canadian Studio Rumored in Windsor\n\nWindsor, Ont.Ã¢Â€Â”Fred W. Martin, Canadian promoter of the new Detroit-Windsor tunnel, announces that a 10-year lease has been obtained on a site here for a motion picture studio in which British Gaumont will be interested. It is planned to start production in April. Pictures will be released here and in England.\n\nFilm Daily, August 27, 1932:\n\nMaking of British Quota Films Is Aim of Canadian Studio Group\n\nTorontoÃ¢Â€Â”Canada Productions, Ltd., a million-dollar motion picture production company, is being organized for the purpose of buying and operating the present Ontario Government studios at Trenton, Ont. The plan is to have the large American companies produce their British quota films at the Trenton studios, thus solving this growing problem for them. Production of enough good pictures in England to fill the quota, which jumps to 15 per cent next year, 17Â½ in 1934-35, and 20 per cent in 1935-36, is already being found extremely difficult, and it is believed that a studio in Canada, accessible to Hollywood, would simplify the situation. Two Canadian provinces, Ontario and British Columbia, also have film quota laws, though not as yet put into force.\n\nThe plan proposed by Canada Productions, Ltd., is to have the American companies send their stars and directors of British citizenship to the Trenton, Ont., studios to make a number of features annually to fill the English quotas. In this way, the company having its distributing organization in Canada, the United States and Britain, and employing the services of screen stars and directors well and favorably known in the American theater, will be assured of release for its film productions.\n\nThe actors, and directors, now in Hollywood, who are British subjects and who are available for motion picture production in Canada under the British quota regulations, include:\n\nActresses: Lilliam Rich, Elsie Ferguson, Alice White, Polly Moran, Dorothy Mackaill, Fay Wray, Doris Lloyd, Barbara Kent, Daphne Pollard, Beryl Mercer, Aileen Pringle and Marie Prevost.\n\nActors: Clive Brook, Reginald Denny, Montagu Love, Tom Moore, Owen Moore, Matt Moore, Ivor Novello, Walter Pidgeon, Jameson Thomas, Alan Mowbray, Walter Huston, David Manners, Ralph Forbes, John Loder and Harold Neison.\n\nDirectors: Donald Crisp, Rupert Julian, Mal St. Clair, Alan Dwan, Emmett Flynn, George Melford, Sidney Olcott, James Whale, John Robertson, Leslie Pearce and Nick Carter.\n\nThere is a report that those interesting themselves in this new Canadian film venture include Sir Herbert Holt, president of the Bank of Montreal, and E. W. Beatty, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nThe Willows Park Years\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., August 4, 1932:\n\nKenneth Bishop\n\nNot Agent for\n\nParamount Firm\n\nKenneth J. Bishop, who is named in the draft of the lease on the Manufacturers' Building at Victoria, is a motion picture producer from California, and if arrangements are completed here, will produce six pictures at the Willows, which will be purchased by a company in England, it was learned from the solicitor of the British Columbia company.\n\nMr. Bishop states he is not a representative of the Paramount company, however, as was stated by Alderman H. O. Litchfield at last Monday's meeting of the City Council, and reported in the Colonist. Solicitors of the British Columbia company, in making the announcement yesterday, stated they wished to stress this point.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., August 17, 1932:\n\nLOCAL FILM CORPORATION GIVEN LEASE\n\nCommonwealth Productions,\n\nLtd., Will Start First Picture\n\nNext Month\n\nThe first step in the establishment of a motion picture industry here was completed yesterday when officials of the British Columbia Agricultural Association signed a lease giving the Commonwealth Production[s], Limited, of British Columbia, use of the Industrial Building for production purposes.\n\nSteps will be taken immediately to push forward the arrangements for equipping the building so that production work can be started on the first picture early in September, it was announced by Kenneth Bishop, producer for the company.\n\nFIRST PICTURE CHOSEN\n\nThe Commonwealth Production[s], Limited, is under contract to provide six pictures for an English firm, the first to be \"The Crimson West,\" a story of British Columbia's timberland, written by a British Columbia author, Alex Philip.\n\nMr. Bishop stated that when all equipment was installed and the plant in full operation, the industry would mean the expenditure of $100,000, approximately, every forty-five days in Victoria. Initial cost of equipping the building will amount to approximately $50,000, he said.\n\nThe building will have to be given acoustic treatment, either with celotex or more likely a substitute provided by a local firm, so that the auditorium will be soundproof. Cameras and lighting equipment also will be brought here within the next few weeks.\n\nMr. Bishop stated that further contracts were now under negotiation and that the company expected to make productions for other companies under the British quota law.\n\nInquiries also have been received from Hollywood as to the possibility of renting studio space and sound equipment for the purpose of making pictures here under the quota law.\n\nIn discussing the marketing of the six films with the English corporation, Mr. Bishop said that two negatives would be made. The original would be sent to England, while the second would undergo alterations to make it marketable in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nSound advertising and news reel work will be other undertakings. Western news features will be taken for distribution in the East, while the Walt Disney studios in Hollywood would probably produce part of their Mickey Mouse films here to come within the quota law, he said.\n\nSTORIES ACCEPTED\n\nTwenty-five stories had been submitted for consideration to the producers, Mr. Bishop stated, and of this number five had been accepted and forwarded to England for final approval before filming. \"Crimson West\" already had been accepted as the first scenario. Other pictures to follow will be a British Columbia fishing story, a British Columbia mining story and a modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police story.\n\nNote: The Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., August 5, 1932, reported the incorporation of Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., $250,000, Vancouver.\n\nFilm Daily, September 7, 1932:\n\nQUOTA PICTURES PLANNED BY NEW VICTOR[IA] STUDIO\n\nMaking of quota pictures, using talent known to the American public, is planned by Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., which has been organized in Victoria, British Columbia. George H. Callahan [Callaghan], 220 West 42nd St. [New York], has been appointed sole representative for the company, which is erecting a studio in Victoria. Callahan [Callaghan] leaves New York for Victoria within a few days.\n\nFirst of the studio buildings has been completed. Floor coverage amounts to 18,000 square feet in a building 210 ft. by 85 ft., with head clearance of 35 feet. K. J. Bishop of Victoria, a director of Commonwealth, is now en route to Hollywood to buy equipment. A laboratory is also planned.\n\nNote: George H. Callaghan was foreign representative of Kenneth J. Bishop's previous company, Tennek Film Corp., New York, which was formed in 1925.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., September 8, 1932:\n\nEXPERT PASSES ON EQUIPMENT\n\nCharles Pettit Joins Movie\n\nCompanyâ€”Gives Advice\n\nin Acoustic Lines\n\nCharles Pettit, who has been sound engineer for the Northern Electric Company, has become identified with the Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., of this city, which is engaged in the preparation for the production of motion pictures here. Mr. Pettit has arrived in the city and is staying at the Dominion Hotel. Yesterday he visited the Exhibition buildings, which are to be utilized for the initial picture productions.\n\nFor the next few days, as sound engineer for the Commonwealth Productions, he will be busy investigating just what has to be done with the buildings there to convert them to the uses for which they are now to be employed.\n\nHe has come here under arrangement with Kenneth J. Bishop, the president of the local production company, after having been identified himself with the company.\n\nARRANGING FOR CAST\n\nMr. Pettit says that Mr. Bishop is proceeding to Hollywood for the purpose of carrying into execution his engagements for the artists who are to take part in the first picture. In the opinion of Mr. Pettit, inside of about five weeks or a little more they should be ready here to enter upon the work of producing the first picture.\n\nAfter consultation with Mr. Bishop, Mr. Pettit says the Radio Corporation of America equipment, one of the two standard ones used on the continent, is to be adopted for use here. The providing of the acoustic features to convert the buildings at the Exhibition grounds into the uses for which the Commonwealth Productions Company want, is to be placed in the hands of the Sidney Roofing Company. He himself is now engaged in preparing the exact specifications relative to this, and from these the Sidney Roofing Company will prepare their equipment.\n\nIS WELL QUALIFIED\n\nThe work in hand is in line with what Mr. Pettit has been engaged for a long time, for the company with which he was identified he had to provide equipment for moving picture houses.\n\nFor a number of years Mr. Pettit has been engaged in research work in this particular line of sound conservation and acoustics. He will from now on have an active part in the carrying into execution of the picture productions in this city under Mr. Bishop. Mr. Pettit is exceedingly sanguine with regard to the prospects of producing pictures in Victoria.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., October 6, 1932:\n\nFilm Studio\n\nMaterial Is\n\nComing Here\n\nGathering of the necessary material for the production of motion pictures in this city is almost completed, the Trades and Labor Council was informed last night.\n\nA committee reporting on what progress had been made stated that it had learned that all developing equipment had been purchased and that cameras had been shipped to Victoria from Hollywood.\n\nKenneth Bishop, producer of Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., is expected back in the city shortly and work on \"The Crimson West\" will get under way probably the latter part of this month.\n\nFilm Daily, December 1, 1932:\n\nNew Canadian Company Will Make Quota Films\n\nStarting with a program of at least 12 features, Commonwealth Productions has been formed with Kenneth J. Bishop as president and general manager and George H. Callahan [Callaghan] as sales manager. Company will make quota pictures, working in its new studio at Victoria, British Columbia, with production beginning in January. Studio will be equipped and ready this month. H. S. Drummond-Hay is business and studio manager for the company, which has several deals under way to make quota pictures for American distributors.\n\nMotion Picture Herald, December 10, 1932:\n\nNew Canadian Company to\n\nProduce Quota Pictures\n\nCommonwealth Productions, Ltd., an entirely British organization, has been formed at Victoria, B.C., for the production of quota pictures. George H. Callahan [Callaghan], American representative for the new company, has established offices at 220 West 42d street, New York.\n\nEquipment is being acquired for a new studio, to be erected in Victoria.\n\nFilm Daily, July 24, 1933:\n\nNine Exchanges in Britain Being Opened by Columbia\n\nLondonÃ¢Â€Â”Eight or nine exchanges in the British Isles, including offices in Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff, Glasgow, Dublin, Liverpool and Newcastle, besides London, will be opened by Columbia, said Harry Cohn in announcing the company's plans here. Executives of the new Columbia distributing organization here are Joseph Friedman, managing director; Max Thorpe, sales manager; Angus N. Trimmer, assistant to Friedman, and George Ayre, publicity director. In the matter of production, Cohn said the company would first concentrate on one film for international release, and if it proves satisfactory a studio may be acquired.\n\nNote: Columbia previously did not distribute in the U.K., which was handled by others. At the same time that the company announced their distributing organization, a production unit was also created, Columbia (British) Productions, Ltd. The \"one film for international release\" would be \"The Lady is Willing\" starring Leslie Howard. Columbia, however, would not subsequently make more films in the U.K. or acquire a studio, the company relying exclusively on U.K. production companies and those of the Dominion to fulfill its quota obligations.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., April 8, 1933:\n\nCast Is Announced\n\nFor Mystery Film;\n\nSeven Sets Ready\n\nEvelyn Brent Takes Title Roleâ€”William Bevan,\n\nof \"Cavalcade,\" and Jameson Thomas Are\n\nCo-Starsâ€”Actual Filming to Start May 1\n\nThe entire cast and technical staff for \"The Mystery of Harlow Manor,\" to be produced for the screen at the Willows studio of the Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., were announced yesterday by Kenneth J.

Others cast in the picture are James McGrath, late of the McLeod Players; Reginald Hincks, Arthur Legge-Willis, Edith Scott-Burritt, Rene Lendegren and Cicele Nichols. One other from Vancouver will be announced later. All have had professional experience either on the stage or screen.\n\nTECHNICAL STAFF\n\nThe technical staff, which, like the three stars from Hollywood, will be British in personnel, comprises the following: Kenneth J, Bishop, producer; Clifford Smith, director; William Beckway, cameraman; Arthur Hilton, film editor, and Martin Kroeger and Arthur Hoerl, continuity writers.\n\nA sound director has yet to be appointed. Clifford Deaville will be sound engineer. The Hollywood cast was arranged through Lichtig & Englander and the firm of Joyce & Selznick. Mr. Bishop has been associated with the former firm for some years, and has been given great assistance in the selection of his title roles.\n\nHe stated yesterday that these two casting offices were the only ones empowered to engage artists for the Commonwealth Productions, Limited, and that any persons misrepresenting themselves, as has occurred recently, as casting officials for the company will be dealt with drastically.\n\nEIGHT SETS\n\nThe picture calls for eight sets, six of which have been completed and the seventh under way. An eighth set will be ready in time for the actual filming on May 1. The sets comprise a drawing-room scene in an old ruined castle, with secret panels, and furnished in Tudor style; two bedroom sets; an underground pool; a ruined banquet hall in the castle; a miniature of the castle; another miniature of the second floor of the castle, and a garden path and gate set. David Fair, of Oak Bay, is constructing the sets.\n\nA location has been found for the studio's laboratory, and work is now being forwarded to put this in readiness for the laboratory chief, who will be appointed later.\n\nEvelyn Brent, who, according to Mr. Bishop, fits ideally into a mystery picture, was starred in \"Mad Parade,\" \"Traveling Husbands\" and \"Pagan Lady\" in 1931. Last year she played in \"High Pressure,\" \"Attorney for the Defence\" and \"The Crusader.\"\n\nSEEN HERE RECENTLY\n\nWilliam Bevan, who is another British actor in Hollywood, was recently seen here with Charles Laughton in \"Payment Deferred,\" an M.G.M. picture. He took a character part in \"Cavalcade\" and the title role in \"Silent Witness,\" which also has been shown here.\n\nIn 1931 he was starred or took leading parts in \"Transatlantic,\" \"Sky Devils,\" \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Journey's End,\" \"Luxury Liner,\" and \"A Study in Scarlet,\" a Sherlock Holmes film.\n\nJameson Thomas is a well-known British actor who went to Hollywood some two or three years ago. In 1931 he played in \"Lover Come Back,\" \"Night Life in Reno,\" \"Convicted,\" and \"Devil Plays.\" In 1932 he appeared in \"Three Wise Girls,\" \"Trial of Vivienne Ware,\" \"Escapade,\" \"The Phantom President,\" and \"No More Orchids.\"\n\nWRITES THEME SONG\n\nMusic for the film will be provided locally, Mr. Bishop stated. Bert Zala, of this city, has been engaged for the incidental music, and has provided two theme songs of his own composition, one entitled \"Natalie,\" after the heroine in the play.\n\nClifford Smith, who will direct the film, has been associated with Mr. Bishop in the past. He directed William S. Hart in fifty-eight pictures, and also has directed Tom Mix, Buck Jones, Hoot Gibson and several pictures for Mr. Bishop, who at that time was starring William Patton, Eileen Sedgewick and Jose Sedgewick.\n\nFILM EDITOR\n\nArthur Hilton, film editor, has been engaged by Universal and Warner Bros., and at the present time is with Byron [Bryan] Foy in Culver City. He has edited such pictures as Sabatini's \"Captain Thunder,\" and \"Virtuous Husbands.\"\n\nThe camera man, another important position on the technical staff, will be filled by Mr. Beckway, who shot such pictures as Rider Haggard's \"She,\" and \"The Wizard of Oz.\" He also has been working recently on Larry Seamen [Seamon] pictures, and is vice-president of the Cinematographers' Association of Hollywood.\n\nR.C.A. SOUND\n\nIndependent sound equipment will be used for this film until the arrival here of a sound truck from Hollywood. R.C.A. Sound equipment will be used on the productions to follow, arrangements having been made through Frank Boyd, Western Canadian manager of R.C.A., Victoria, for the use of the machines with R.C.A. absorbing the duty on the importation, Mr. Bishop stated.\n\n\"The whole financial structure is being handled by the London Western Trust Company, a national organization,\" Mr. Bishop stated.\n\nHe explained that arrangements had been made through E. B. Westby, manager of the Vancouver office, whereby all capital of the local company had been placed in trust for general supervision by the London Western Trust Company.\n\nNote: Commonwealth's first production, \"The Mystery of Harlow Manor,\" was never completed, as documented in The Dunsmuir Saga by Terry Reksten: \"On 30 July 1932 he [Kenneth J. Bishop] launched Commonwealth Productions, a company registered in British Columbia, which had Bishop as its president and Kathleen Humphreys [Dunsmuir] as one of its most prominent backers. An abandoned exhibition building on the Willows Fairground was fitted up as a sound stage, and in February 1933 production began on The Mystery of Harlow Manor, which would take advantage of the beauty of Hatley Park for its exterior scenes and the talents of Kathleen Humphreys in a small supporting role. Three months into production that project was shelved and work was begun on a more ambitious and expensive film, The Crimson Paradise, in which Kathleen invested $10,000 and in which she would be permitted to star.\"\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., May 2, 1933:\n\nDIRECTOR OF\n\nFILMS HERE\n\nClifford Smith Arrives From\n\nHollywood to Direct Local\n\nMotion Picture\n\nClifford Smith, director for the Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., arrived from Hollywood on the Ss. Ruth Alexander last night, and today will be taken to the Willows to inspect the sets that have been prepared for the filming of \"The Mystery of Harlow Manor.\"\n\nHe was met at the boat by Kenneth Bishop, producer, who has organized the company and done all the ground work so far. Mr. Smith when asked if he had read the continuity script for \"The Mystery of Harlow Manor,\" replied in the affirmative, and declared he was very much pleased with the vehicle he had been asked to direct for Mr. Bishop.\n\nTO COLLABORATE\n\nMr. Bishop announced last night that Mr. Smith and himself would collaborate on a Northwest story to follow the production of \"The \"Mystery of Harlow Manor\" so that no time will be lost in getting the company into its production schedule.\n\nDuring the course of the interview, Mr. Smith expressed the opinion that no better time could have been chosen for the establishment of a motion picture production here. \"The British quota will reach its maximum in 1935, but what is more important is the fact that Mr. Bishop has started producing here when Hollywood is changing over from the dual programme to the old type of entertainment.\"\n\nHOLLYWOOD CHANGE\n\nThe day of two feature pictures on one programme is over, according to the latest news brought from Hollywood by Mr. Smith.\n\nMr. Bishop said that Arthur Hilton, film editor, would leave for Victoria probably Wednesday. Evelyn Brent, who has been chosen for the title role, is at present fulfilling an engagement on Broadway, which is expected to end in another week.\n\nFilm Daily, September 21, 1933:\n\nNick Stuart, the actor, and Dave Kay have started an agency to represent actors, writers and directors. Offices have been opened at 9000 Sunset Blvd.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., September 26, 1933:\n\nSixteen Motion\n\nPictures to Be\n\nFilmed in City\n\nContract Between New York Distributing House\n\nand Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., Signed\n\nâ€”Studios Rushed to Meet Requirements of\n\nFirst Delivery Date, November 15\n\nA contract for the production and delivery of sixteen motion pictures to Showmen's Pictures, Incorporated, New York, has been signed, sealed and delivered to Kenneth J. Bishop, producer, and the directors of the Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., it was announced yesterday. [The company's name was technically Showmens Pictures.]\n\nThe signed copy of the contract was received yesterday and the studios at the Willows already are a hive of activity as preliminary work is being rushed to complete production of the first picture, delivery of which is stipulated as on or about November 15 in the contract.\n\nThere are two schedules of production. One is for a series of eight pictures, of varying types, while the next series of eight is on a rising scale of production cost, the pictures toward the close of the contract being on a more ambitious scale than those of the first series.\n\nLEADING MAN\n\nIt is stipulated in the contract that Nick Stuart, whose 1932 schedule of pictures, according to the motion picture blue book, include some outstanding successes, shall be the leading man. Three of them were \"Sherlock,\" \"Mystery Train,\" and \"Sundown Trail.\"\n\nRobert Hill, who directed in 1932 \"Sundown Trail,\" \"Log Bound,\" \"Come On Danger,\" and \"Cheyenne Kid,\" has been appointed director.\n\nSIGNATORIES\n\nDavid J. Mountain, president of Showmen's Pictures Incorporated, and secretary of the company, signed the contract, while, on behalf of the Commonwealth Productions Company, Kenneth Bishop, president, and R. A. Butchart, secretary, appended their signatures.\n\nShowmen's Pictures, Incorporated, has offices located at 723 Seventh Avenue, New York, while branch offices are located in Paris and London.\n\nThe contract stipulates that, in addition to Nick Stuart as leading man, the local company must use one or more leading ladies of Hollywood prominence. Mr. Bishop is now negotiating for one or two actresses to play opposite Stuart. The rest of the cast will be local experienced actors and actresses.\n\nCONSTRUCT SETS\n\nSets already are under construction at the Willows. Three are nearly completed, and four others have yet to be erected. There are eleven interior scenes and thirty exterior locations, with approximately 150 scenes. In all the scrip[t] calls for 290 scenes.\n\nAdaption of \"The Crimson West,\" the first picture, was done by Arthur Hoerl, whose 1932 schedule of adaptions included \"Cross Examination,\" \"Last Ride,\" \"Probation,\" \"Midnight Patrol,\" \"They Never Come Back,\" \"Arms of the Law,\" \"Guilty or Not Guilty,\" and \"Big Town.\"\n\nBRITISH QUOTA\n\nAll pictures in both series must be 100 per cent under the British quota, the contract states. Delivery of all pictures must be made at six-week intervals after the first has been delivered in New York, the contract reads.\n\nThe local company shortly will change its name to correspond to some extent with the name of the firm with which the contract was made. Incidentally, the Victoria company will operate under the N.R.A. in conjunction with the distributing organization taking its pictures.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., September 28, 1933:\n\n'Slams and Salaams'\n\nBy H. T. M.\n\nSalaams (I think) to the Commonwealth Productions. Ltd. For it really looks as if the much-discussed project of a moving picture industry in Victoria has leapt from a possibility to a probability.\n\nKenneth J. Bishop, producer for the company, announced on Tuesday that he had received a contract (a real contract!) for sixteen picturesâ€”and, believe me, Mr. Bishop was a happy man when we saw him Wednesday!\n\n\"We're going ahead,\" he declared, with the sincerest vehemence that I've heard emanate from any man who's been trying to \"put anything over\" in Victoria for the past thirty years, \"we're going to produce these picturesâ€”and don't any of you skeptical, self-styled newspaper men ever fool yourselves!\"\n\nYesâ€”Mr. Bishop was swooping around in circles of sheer ecstacy [sic]â€”and I don't blame him! He's been having a tough time, for a long time, but it now looks as if his day has dawned. He explained about the British film quota businessâ€”showed us a copy of it's [sic] rules and regulations, etc., which were far too complicated for a \"hack\" columnist to monkey withâ€”nevertheless, that \"quota\" thing is very important in regard to proving that there is an actual and growing necessity (not just a demand) for 100 per cent British picturesâ€”and of course, that means outlet and markets, and so forth. But, what seemed unusually interesting (along market lines) were a number of letters from well-known American concerns, expressing, in no anaemic vein, their willingness (I might even hazard, eagerness) to accept British-made pictures.\n\nNow those letters seemed very digestible. For they seemed to say, that, if Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., can produce the goodsâ€”then, the American eagle might at last peck at the situationâ€”and, when the American eagle pecks, it generally pecks in something that's going to be pretty nutritious to it's [sic] own crop. In which case, it's liable to lay an egg or so, later.\n\nNow the yoke of any egg is goldenâ€”so, if the \"eagle\" pecks, and then lays, right on the steps of the concern in question, there's liable to be quite a lot of cacklingâ€”or, don't you get what I'm driving at?\n\nAnyway, it looks like the Commonwealth people have a good, sporting chance. If they succeed, Victoria will bless them (Victoria's good at cantering in on the \"kill\" and then roaring out ear-splitting huzzahs)â€”but that sort of thing isn't worth a nickel. The idea is to help them succeed. To boost them, and to lend them any possible assistance. Does Victoria do that sort of thingâ€”or, have we ever heard of Victoria knocking anything in the way of possible local industry? (Now just where did that rather derogatory notion about Victoria sprout from? Miserable, eh?)\n\nFilm Daily, October 2, 1933:\n\nReport Contracts Signed For 16 Canadian Films\n\nTorontoÃ¢Â€Â”Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., film company, has a contract signed with distributors in New York City for the production of 16 pictures in British Columbia, according to the Canadian Press.

Bishop. Many well known and socially prominent Victorians were among those who participated in the rehearsal, and who will actually take part in the filming of this scene.\n\nMr. Hill explained the general idea of the scene, and then introduced Miss Lucille Brown and Nick Stuart, of Hollywood, who have come here to take the leads.

The Act states: \"If the Board of Trade at any time have reason to believe that ... a film has been incorrectly registered as a British film, they may call for such evidence as they think fit as to the correctness or otherwise of the registration, and if satisfied that the film has been or is incorrectly registered, they shall correct the register and issue an amended certificate of registration.\"\n\nShowmens Pictures, Inc., New York, cancelled the sixteen-picture deal with Commonwealth Productions based on the grounds that the British quota was not complied, since the screenplay was written by New York-born Arthur Hoerl. The Cinematograph Films Act, 1927, stipulated \"The author of the scenario must have been a British subject,\" this clause perhaps misinterpreted by Kenneth J. Bishop, since the source of the scenario was a book by a Canadian author, Alex Philip, although born in the U.S. It was also reported that the film failed its quota requirements because too few members of the cast and crew were of British origin, but this seems unlikely.\n\nUnlike \"Secrets of Chinatown,\" I could find no evidence of \"The Crimson Paradise\" being released in the U.K., besides being trade shown.\n\nThe film was cut from 68 minutes to 55 minutes for its U.S. release as \"Fighting Playboy.\" The Variety review listed the running time as 50 minutes.\n\nVariety review, June 2, 1937: Quickie production with little chance of playing time generally, and short to a point of poverty in entertainment value. 'Fighting Playboy' is a new title erected over a little known yarn, 'The Crimson West,' by Alex Phillip.\n\nNick Stuart, never very formidable at the b. o. [box office], garners top billing with Lucille Browne, who has never worked away from the indies. Direction is feeble and sets, those indoors, trashy to the point of comparing with scenic efforts in tent rep. With but few instances, most of the credit rests with Stuart.\n\nStory is about a playboy disowned by his father for nightly carousing. Goes into the Canadian north woods and carves out a future, a big job and a bride.\n\nMedia availability: None. This is probably a lost film. The Canadian Feature Film Index showed no elements for the film.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., November 3, 1933:\n\nMOVIE STARS\n\nSOUTHBOUND\n\nSets Prepared for \"The\n\nBlack Robe,\" Second Film\n\nto Be Made Here\n\nNick Stuart and Lucille Brown, stars of \"The Crimson West,\" first full-length feature motion picture to be produced in Victoria, left for Seattle, yesterday afternoon, enroute to Hollywood. Kenneth J. Bishop, producer; Robert Hill, director; Mrs. Selden Humphries [Humphreys], Miss Laura Dunsmuir, Miss Laura Audain, Robert P. Webb and others of the company were at the boat to bid them farewell.\n\nImmediately following their departure, Mr. Bishop started arrangements for the next picture to be produced under contract by the Commonwealth Productions, Ltd. Mr. Bishop will leave for Vancouver tonight, to complete arrangements for the premiere showing of \"The Crimson West\" in Vancouver, and then go to Hollywood to supervise the final details in connection with the cutting and editing of the film.\n\nWhile Mr. Bishop is in Hollywood, Mrs. Humphries [Humphreys] will be in charge of the studios here, having been appointed as Mr. Bishop's deputy. Sets for the next picture, \"The Black Robe,\" a story written by Guy Morton, a Canadian author, will be erected and got in readiness for the return of Nick Stuart, and probably Lucille Brown, early in December.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., November 7, 1933:\n\nWILL SUPERVISE\n\nCUTTING OF FILM\n\nKenneth J. Bishop, Producer,\n\nLeaves for Hollywood After\n\nArranging for Premiere\n\nKenneth J. Bishop, producer of the Commonwealth Pictures, Inc., has left for Hollywood to supervise the cutting and editing of \"The Crimson West,\" produced here, and is expected back in ten days to make final arrangements for the second motion picture to be produced here, Guy Morton's \"Black Robe.\"\n\nDuring his absence, Mrs. Selden Humphreys has been appointed his deputy to be in charge of the work now in progress, chiefly construction of sets for the new picture.\n\nPrior to leaving for Hollywood, Mr. Bishop went to Vancouver, where her arranged for a premiere showing of \"The Crimson West\" in that city.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., November 10, 1933:\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERNâ€”NOTICE is hereby given that Mr. H. S. Drummond-Hay is not in the employ of this company in any capacity. Commonwealth Productions, Limited.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., November 12, 1933:\n\nVICTORIA MAKES MOVIES\n\nBy Percy C. Richards\n\nVictoria has witnessed an accomplishment in the world of art, for a full-length talking picture feature has been finished here by local enterprise. Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., has filmed a British Columbia story written by Alex Phillip, a British Columbia author. With the completion of this film, Victoria may look forward with confidence towards the permanent establishment here of a new and valuable industry.\n\nThe talkie has been made. It is now on its way to New York and London distributors, and fifteen more stories are to be filmed, under contract with an international distributing bureau. Upon the success of the initial contract will largely depend whether or not Victoria will become Canada's motion picture centre. Those who have followed the course of the picturing of \"The Crimson West\" are confident of its success and of the ultimate destiny of Victoria in the world of celluloid.\n\nIt has been a herculean task that confronted Kenneth Bishop in his endeavors to establish a picture studio here, and not the least has been the attitude of many citizens who, instead of boosting and aiding in the founding of a new industry, have unconsciously, or consciously, done much to make the way difficult. But despite all handicaps and obstacles, with the generous assistance of a little group of public spirited individuals, the picture has been madeâ€”and well made.\n\nAchieved Purpose\n\n\"I said I would film 'The Crimson West' in Victoria. It has been done,\" declared Mr. Bishop when the last scene was taken. \"This picture will be followed by another upon which assembling of the sets is already under way. It will be 'The Black Robe,' a story featuring scenes in Vancouver's Chinatown, from the pen of Guy Morton, a Canadian newspaperman. The story will be largely filmed in the studio. I am deeply grateful to those who have assisted me.\"\n\nThere is no reason, in the opinion of the technicians who watched the filming of \"The Crimson West\" why Victoria, with its charm of scenery, its exquisite setting and its superior climate should not indeed become Canada's film centre. Visitors from Hollywood, and there have been a number of them, expressed surprise and delight at the studio arrangements at the Willows. And Hollywood is watching with interest the developments here. Not long ago two highly placed technicians visited Victoria simply to inspect the plant here.\n\n\"We are watching closely the efforts of Mr. Bishop here in Victoria,\" said one. \"If he succeeds you will see half a dozen studios in operation here. He is pioneering, and you should give him every encouragement. Hollywood is interested because it is realized that British countries are anxious for British-made films. The tendency is to increase quota lawsâ€”and Hollywood appreciates that to serve the vast markets of the British Empire, films in the future must be made on British soil with the major part of the cast British actors and actresses. There are scores of British actors in the United States. That is why Hollywood is anxiously watching Ken Bishop and wishing him good luck.\"\n\nPicture Well Made\n\nCommonwealth Productions, Ltd., has produced its first picture. An experienced director has directed it; capable and experienced actors have taken part in it; the settings have been excellent, and Victorians will have the opportunity in a few weeks to witness and applaud the initial showing of Canada's first full-length talking feature. They will see an orderly presentation of a British Columbia story; the making of whichâ€”like all moviesâ€”evolved from chaosâ€”for there is nothing more chaotic-appearing to the inexperienced than the assembling and \"shooting\" of the multitude of scenes that go into the manufacture of a motion picture.\n\nTo see a motion picture company in action is something almost too bewildering and confusing for words. To stand and listen to the peculiar jargon of the director, producer, members of the cast, electricians and other technicians is like listening to a new language.\n\nWhen one gazes at the silver screen and sees the action of the picture flashing before the eyes, little thought is given as to how the various scenes must have appeared when the film was in production.\n\nFor instance, in \"The Crimson West,\" there is a fight scene in an employment bureau. Nick Stuart, cast in the lead, is looking for a job. He bumps into a tough hombre in the form of a lumberjack named George. They get into a fight, and that fight leads to a prize ring contract.\n\nScene on the Set\n\nPrevious to this scene being shot, script cards were issued for those who were to appear on the set. The necessary \"props\" or properties had to be assembled. The set looked fine until the cameramen and electricians got to work, then everything appeared chaotic. A mass of wires was strung all over the place. One had to be careful not to trip ever them. Batteries of lights were placed right on the set so that to a layman it looked as if there was nothing in the set that could be photographed without revealing the chaotic condition.\n\nThere was no ceiling to the set, and around the top of the walls were other batteries of lights. The camera stood amid this welter of lights, wires and machinery. A long steel boom hung out over the set, just above the actors' heads, out of vision of the camera, but close enough to catch every word, or every sound and blow in a fight.\n\nThen the chief electrician asked the director if everything is ready.\n\n\"Ready.\"\n\n\"Hit 'em,\" the electrician shouted, and every light on the set was turned on full blast. Where it was dim light before flashed a brilliance equal to daylight. Under these lights a rehearsal of the scene took place. The camera was focused; the floor marked off into danger zones to guide members of the cast from stepping out of the camera's vision.\n\n\"Rest 'em,\" the chief electrician ordered as the rehearsal concluded.\n\nLights are too expensive to replace very often, and they burn out frequently under the power that is used.\n\nWith the rehearsal out of the way, final arrangements were made to \"shoot\" the scene. A second camera was stationed further on the set to one side and out of the other camera's vision. This second camera was for taking close-ups to avoid duplication of acting.\n\nSetting the Scenes\n\nA technician entered the set and the A.C. lights were turned off and the batteries of lights again turned on. The man had a yellow card in his hand with radiating lines on it. This he held in the centre of the scene that was to be taken and the cameras were focused for the shooting. The man stepped in front of the camera with another card on which the set and scene numbers were chalked on a black background. Also the number of the \"take\" was marked on the board. The camera recorded this identification of the scene, for without it the film cutters and editors could not work.\n\nIn the fight between Nick Stuart and George three shots were taken, and none of them were altogether satisfactory to Mr. Hill, the director.\n\n\"Cut it. Cut it,\" the director shouted as another shot was spoiled.\n\n\"Say, this is the fight which wins a $100 meal ticket for Nick. I can't stand that kind of stuff you're giving me,\" Mr. Hill yelled, and jumped into the set.\n\nHe took hold of Nick and went through the fight with him, and it certainly looked realistic. George stood by and watched and got a few pointers on how to direct a left to the chin, and incidentally on how to make every punch look as if it were telling.\n\n\"We'll run this at eighteen,\" the director told the cameraman as he returned to his post to direct a fourth shot. That fourth try was more realistic than the director, or anyone else had anticipated.\n\n\"You'll go to jail for that,\" Nick started, as he spoke his lines. He grasped George by the coat lapels as he made this remark and the fight began.\n\nRealistic Acting\n\nThe two scuffled and punched around and then the knockout blow from Nick was given. George went down, but in doing so he crashed with such a bang that his head struck the floor with a resounding bound.\n\n\"Cut, cut,\" came the order again, but this time preceded by an expletive indicative of concern for George. However, George was quickly brought round and the fight scene was finished. The fourth \"take\" had been so realistic that no more shooting was necessary.\n\nFollowing this scene came another on the same set, depicting Nick rising from the fight, picking his hat up off the floor and receiving the congratulations of the employment bureau clerk. As he answered him his words came in gasps as a result of his exertions.\n\nSome time elapsed between the fight scene and the talk between the employment bureau clerk and Nick, but the necessary after-fight effect in the voice was provided by the director tussling with Nick on the set just before the cameras were ready to record the next scene.\n\n\"We'll run this at eighteen,\" the director had said just before the fight was shot. Curious to know just what he meant, I asked Mr. Hill to explain his instruction.\n\nHe said that the average number of pictures taken per second was twenty. By cutting down the number the action was speeded up. A slight speeding up in motion picture fights was necessary, he said, because the action of the fighters was not as fast as a real fight, because they have to watch the blows they are making. Each blow must be a good one.\n\nBlows Must Count\n\nIn an ordinary fight, many poor blows are struck before a good one is landed. The producer has not the film or time to waste taking a picture of fighting as fight fans know it. In addition, action must be accentuated on a film in order to grip the audience. Always, there is a tendency to slightly exaggerate. If this were not done the action would fall flat.\n\nIt is generally believed that to speed up action the crank of a camera is turned faster. Such is not the case, however. The faster the film is turned the more pictures of the action are recorded. This is not so. The fewer recordings the faster the action. This is illustrated by the filming of a pendulum on a clock. If twenty pictures are taken during one swing of a pendulum and then another strip of ten pictures taken, the action appears to be faster in the last strip since it would only take ten pictures to depict the action on the screen as against twenty. It is something like the difference between a short story and the new type short, short story.\n\nThere were many thrilling scenes taken for the picture, but there were some that were not filmed. One was when the company was on location at Sooke, and it was necessary for the cameramen to perch their cameras on the edge of a cliff at a dangerous angle in order to accentuate some particularly perilous moment in an outdoor shot.\n\nLucille Brown had to fall out of a tree into the arms of Nick Stuart in another scene. There were lumber mill scenes; a jail; several log cabin interiors and the library of a palatial home.\n\nIn the dressing of the interior sets Mrs. Selden Humphreys was a past master at the art. It is difficult to realize just how many things there are to think of in dressing a set. Not even a couple of newlyweds, who have just finished furnishing their home, could hardly set about the task without missing something.\n\nThere were thousands of dollars worth of furnishings assembled on the library set alone. There was a mantlepiece, of considerable antiquity, which itself was worth several thousands of dollars.\n\nBooks Not Painted\n\nSince the library was to be furnished with a certain period of furniture there had to be uniformity throughout, and incidentally it was no simple task to fill the book shelves. The books were not fake backs. There was many a bookshelf raided to fill up the shelves on the library set.\n\nScene painting for window backgrounds had to be carefully done so that the view from the windows would correspond to the outside shots to be taken later.\n\nBoth Nick Stuart and Lucille Brown were high in their praises of the log cabin interiors and other sets. They said that in so far as the log cabin sets were concerned they could not be equalled in Hollywood.\n\n\"It's the real stuff. We have to imitate that down South,\" they said.\n\nLacked Keyhole\n\nAs an example of how well trained a director must be to notice small details that are going to count when the picture is finally produced it might be well to mention Mr. Hill's first inspection of the jail set.\n\nAs soon as he looked at it he called the attention of the carpenter to the fact that there were no keyholes in the locks.\n\nAnyone who thinks that the task of a motion picture star, or any member of the cast and the technical staff, is a light one may quickly dismiss that illusion. The whole company worked from daybreak to the \"wee small hours\" on \"The Crimson West.\" There was one day when the picture was getting too far behind production schedule that the entire staff worked from 6:30 a.m. until 2 o'clock the next morning. But the long hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of any member of the company.\n\nIt was their picture. Such loyalty is not easily found. Their hopes depend on the success of this, the first picture to be produced in Victoria, and on the success of this picture and the others to follow depends the success of Victoria as the motion picture capital of Canada.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., November 26, 1933:\n\nNew Film Series\n\nTo Be Produced\n\nAt Local Studio\n\nColonel W. N. Selig, Hollywood Pioneer, to Make\n\nFilms Here, Kenneth J. Bishop Announcesâ€”\n\nVictoria Company Meets With Success on\n\nFirst Filmâ€”Cast Arranged for Second\n\nColonel William Selig, who is considered the founder of the full length feature motion picture, will produce a series of motion pictures in Victoria, Kenneth J. Bishop, producer of the Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., announced yesterday on his return from Hollywood.\n\nNot only will Colonel Selig produce a series of pictures, but the Commonwealth Productions, Limited, will carry on with its contract of sixteen full-length feature pictures for a New York and London distributing firm with greater confidence than ever, since the first effort was so well received in Hollywood, where many producers and directors were interested in this first attempt to produce sound motion pictures in Canada under the British quota law.\n\nWONDERFUL PICTURE\n\n\"It's a wonderful picture,\" Mr. Bishop said on his return. It surpassed our own expectations, and the Western representative of Showmen's Pictures, Inc., was highly gratified with the results.\"\n\nMr. Bishop stated that he expected to receive the set lists from New York for the next picture by Tuesday or Wednesday, and if possible he would return to Hollywood shortly to complete arrangements for the cast for \"The Black Robe,\" a mystery story written by Guy Morton, Canadian journalist, which uses Vancouver's Chinatown as a background.\n\nIt is coincident that Colonel Selig, who was the first person to produce a long historical photo-drama in Hollywood, should come to Victoria to produce a series of pictures, using the studio of Kenneth Bishop, who once worked for him in the early days of the industry, and who holds the position of having produced the first full-length feature talking picture in Canada.\n\nARRANGES CAST\n\nMr. Bishop said that Nick Stuart would return here in December to appear in \"The Black Robe,\" and that other stars in the cast would probably include Lucille Brown and H. B. Warner.\n\nWhile in Hollywood, Mr. Bishop looked around for good material, and on his return here stated that the Victoria studio would have a new generator plant for the lighting effects on its second picture. New camera and sound equipment also have been secured, thus obviating the necessity of leasing such equipment, as was done with the first picture.\n\nThe supporting cast for \"The Black Robe\" will be chosen from local talent, Mr. Bishop said. The director will either be Robert Hill or Fred Newmeyer. Choice depends on the distributing company.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., December 13, 1933:\n\nWill Begin Filming\n\nOf Second Picture\n\nThis Coming Week\n\nCelebrities and Movie Stars to Attend Premiere\n\nHere Thursday Night of \"Crimson Paradise,\"\n\nFirst All-Canadian Talkie\n\nCommonwealth Productions, Limited, producers of the \"Crimson Paradise,\" first all-Canadian talking motion picture, swings into action again, the coming weekend, when first scenes are shot for the second production, \"Black Robe,\" mystery story of Vancouver's Chinatown. Guy Morton is the author. Kenneth J. Bishop, producer, made the announcement last night, following his return from Hollywood, where he concluded arrangements for the shipping of the \"Crimson Paradise\" to Victoria for a world premiere, Thursday night, in the Capitol Theatre, commencing at 11 o'clock.\n\nIt is the policy of the company to produce snow scenes and mystery stories in the future, featuring the Canadian angle, Mr. Bishop pointed out. A romantic novel of the British Columbia coast, the work of a local writer, is at present being considered with a view to producing, he explained, and went on to intimate that stories by James Oliver Curwood might be filmed if arrangements could be made.\n\nSTARS TO ATTEND\n\nNick Stuart and Lucille Brown, stars in \"The Crimson Paradise,\" will play the leads in \"The Black Robe,\" and are expected to arrive in this city on Thursday at 8:30 a.m., aboard the SS Iroquois, from Seattle, in order to attend the premiere showing.\n\nAlready seven inside sets have been constructed for the next picture, which will also be produced at the Willows, it was stated. Mr. Bishop is not certain whether Robert Hill, who directed the last picture, will supervise \"The Black Robe.\"\n\nPreparations are under way by the company, in conjunction with the Capitol Theatre manager, Ivan Ackery, to feature the first showing of \"The Crimson Paradise\" with a world's premiere, fashioned after the glorified Hollywood fashion. Floodlights will illuminate the theatre front, sidewalk and street, while revolving lights of varied hues will play on the crowds, and high-powered spotlights will focus on the patrons as they step from their automobiles. Mr. Ackery promises special decoration of the theatre front for the occasion.\n\nPREMIER WILL SPEAK\n\nIt is planned for Mr. Ackery to open proceedings with the introduction of Premier Pattullo, who will make a short address, and then introduce Mayor Leeming. It is expected Mayor Leeming will give a brief address before calling on Mr. Bishop to introduce Nick Stuart and Lucille Brown, along with the main members of \"The Crimson Paradise\" cast. Following a vocal solo by Fred Wright, the picture will be given its first showing in Canada, before being whisked away to New York for world distribution.\n\nConfidence in success of locally-produced motion pictures, was strongly expressed, last night, by Miss Kathleen Dunsmuir, director of Commonwealth Productions, Limited, and Mr. Bishop. They both paid tribute to the sixty persons who were engaged in the filming of the first picture, and Miss Dunsmuir stated: \"The results obtained have been entirely due to the efforts of the people in the company.\"\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., December 27, 1933:\n\nFILMING OF NEW\n\n'TALKIE' STARTS\n\nFirst Scenes in \"Black Robe\" Being\n\nTaken at Willows Under Direction\n\nof Fred Newmyere [sic]\n\nFilming of the second talking motion picture on the schedule of the Commonwealth Productions, at the Willows, will start today, when the first scenes will be taken in the making of \"The Black Robe,\" which will star Nick Stuart and Lucille Brown.\n\nA fine cast has been arranged by Producer Ken Bishop. In addition to the two stars who appeared in the \"Crimson Paradise,\" Canada's first \"talkie,\" other experienced film artists will have important parts. Among these will be James Flayburn and Raymond Lawrence.\n\nThe production will be made under the direction of Fred Newmyere [sic], a director who acquired a fine reputation at Hollywood.\n\nThe story to be filmed is one written by Guy Morton, an Eastern Canadian newspaperman.

Guy Morton, the screenwriter and original author, was born in Ontario.\n\nFilm Daily review, February 20, 1935: Not made for the thinking element that may be found here and there in our picture theaters, but for the neighborhood houses this one should have 'em yelling from the balcony. It is a lurid tale of a secret Oriental society headed by a mysterious hooded figure. It seems the police are unable to stop the dastardly work of this organization, so they call in a private investigator, who goes to work to unravel the mystery.

Hinton Takes Over Assets of\n\nCommonwealth Producers, Ltd., by Court Order\n\nIn Supreme Court Chambers, yesterday, Mr. Justice H. B. Bobertson [Robertson] consented to the appointment of a custodian in connection with the Commonwealth Producers, Ltd., and Harold G. Hinton, chartered accountant, was named the custodian. Bonds were fixed at $2,500.\n\nThis course was taken on the initiative of P. J. Sinnott, counsel for Michael Heppell and Barrett Webb, who, a short time ago, petitioned for a receivership based on claims which they put forward for back pay due them. This move was opposed by F. C. Elliott, acting for others interested in the affairs of the film-producing organization, on the grounds that affairs were likely to be solved without such a course being pursued.\n\nAPPLICATION UNOPPOSED\n\nYesterday morning, however, Mr. Elliott did not appear in court when the matter was taken up. Mr. Sinnott announced that Mr. Elliott had informed him that he would not oppose the application being made to name a custodian.\n\nMr. Sinnott informed the court that the only assets appeared to be certain lighting effects and the right to two films. One of these was in New York or in Vancouver. Possession of this film had not yet been obtained. Another film, \"The Black Robe,\" was not completed and would take perhaps $2,000 to finish, he believed.\n\nThe court agreed to the course asked to be taken, putting the affairs of the Commonwealth Producers into bankruptcy, with Mr. Hinton as custodian of the assets.\n\nMotion Picture Daily, March 13, 1934:\n\nVancouver Picture Concern Collapses\n\nVancouver, March 12.Ã¢Â€Â”With liabilities of $52,000 and negligible assets Commonwealth Productions, Ltd., film company which some months ago set up studios near Victoria, and there produced two pictures, has gone into bankruptcy. Among creditors is Kathleen Dunsmuir Humphreys, formerly of the London musical comedy stage, and daughter of the late James Dunsmuir, one-time Lieutenant Governor.\n\nKenneth Bishop, executive of the company, admitted to holding controlling interest in the company with 8,000 shares of common stock at $10 per share. He had not paid for the shares, but claimed his three years' organization work had earned them for him. He valued the two pictures at $25,000 each.\n\nA creditor's committee has been formed to try and rescue some of the money invested.\n\nThe Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C., April 7, 1934:\n\nFILM TRUSTEE\n\nSEEKS ADVICE\n\nCourt Appealed to for Directions\n\nin Legal Aspect of Receivership\n\nThe extent to which the mortgages held by Mrs. A. Seldon Humphreys upon the assets of the Commonwealth Productions, Limited, should have preference has been referred to Mr. Justice H. B. Robertson for directions by H. G. Hinton, the trustee, representing the creditors of the film production company. The application in the matter came before His Lordship, in the Supreme Court Chambers, yesterday, upon application by J. B. Clearihue, acting for the trustee, with H. G. Lawson, K.C., representing Mrs. Humphreys.\n\nIn making the application, Mr. Clearihue pointed out that such a course was provided for. The trustee representing all the creditors was at a loss to know just how far he could go until it was decided whether Mrs. Humphrey [sic], under her mortgages of $5,000 and $2,000, had a preference standing over the other creditors with respect to the assets.\n\nMr. Lawson stated the mortgages were duly executed in a regular way in connection with a business transaction, and under these instruments he had no doubt that Mrs. Humphreys was given a preference.\n\nREVIEWED HISTORY\n\nReviewing the situation, Mr. Clearihue said that a contract was entered into on September 12, 1933, by the Commonwealth Producers, Ltd., to make eight pictures for the Showman's Pictures, Incorporated, of New York. The contract was produced which set out that the purchasing company was to be protected against all claims liable to be made with respect to the negatives produced.\n\nMr. Clearihue stated there could, therefore, be no mortgage placed on the negative. The producing company had assigned to Mrs. Humphreys the right to the $10,000 to be received for the first picture.\n\nMr. Lawson pointed out that this was an assignment of the money to be received and not a chattel mortgage.\n\nIt was pointed out that, following this assignment, the mortgage was executed which was to secure the sum of $5,000, which had been loaned to the producers at 10 per cent.\n\nMr. Clearihue said the position was taken by some creditors that the pictures were not involved under the mortgage which covered the moneys advanced and due, and all electric lighting and sound equipment. He pointed out that the mortgage included the moneys due, the goods and chattels and effects, but the pictures themselves were not mentioned.\n\nA second mortgage in the same language as the first one was produced, covering the amount of $2,000.\n\nQUOTA RULE VIOLATED\n\nThen came the correspondence with the Showman's Pictures concerning the cancellation of the contract, on the ground that the British quota was not complied with, as Mr. Earle [Hoerl], the scenario writer of \"The Crimson Paradise,\" was not a British subject, as required. There was some hope of overcoming this defect, but later the suggestion was made in the correspondence that $5,000 might be obtained instead of the $10,000 as originally set.\n\nMr. Clearihue declared the other picture, partially finished, was in Vancouver. There were three prints of \"The Crimson Paradise,\" one of which was in England, and had never been in Victoria, and it was contended that it should not fall under the same rule as to ownership.\n\nThe whole question was really one of whether the pictures were covered by the terms of the mortgages held by Mrs. Humphreys.\n\nMr. Lawson argued that Mrs. Humphreys, under the arrangements, could take the moneys received, and, as collateral security, could take the pictures themselves. There was nothing to show that the pictures were excluded from the goods and chattels of the property.\n\nMr. Clearihue took the position that the moneys due for the pictures were mortgaged, but not the pictures themselves.\n\nWith this position, Mr. Lawson disagreed.\n\nHis Lordship will consider the matter and give his directions for the benefit of the trustee in guiding him in connection with the administration of the affairs.\n\nFilm Daily, June 13, 1934:\n\nColumbia May Make Own British Quota Pictures\n\nFeasibility of Columbia producing its own British quota requirements of eight to 10 pictures will be studied by Joseph Seidelman, Columbia foreign manager, who sails Saturday for London. Columbia has been having independent producers make its quota pictures. While abroad Seidelman will visit Columbia's continental offices.\n\nMotion Picture Daily, July 2, 1934:\n\nVancouver Excited Over New Film Plan\n\nVancouver, July 1.Ã¢Â€Â”Another attack of filmitis is raging in Vancouver with the arrival of Gaston Glass, who says he represents Joseph I. Schnitzer, with plans to produce six to 18 pictures per year in Canada under the quota law. Glass says he has contracts from an unnamed major company for distribution, and all that remains is to work out some way to make the pictures.\n\nFirst worry is to obtain a building suitable for sound-proofing and making into a studio.\n\nVariety, July 10, 1934:\n\nCOL.'S ENGLISH PROD.,\n\nSID ROGELL AT HELM\n\nHollywood, July 9. Columbia is figuring on producing a group of about 10 features in England during the coming year, and will send Sid Rogell abroad within the next two weeks to make a survey of production possibilities.\n\nHarry Cohn is understood ready to go for the British production idea to take advantage of talent and backgrounds. Pictures produced, in addition to taking care of the Columbia quota requirements, would be aimed for distribution on the regular Columbia program in this country.\n\nMotion Picture Daily, October 5, 1934:\n\nSays Columbia Not To Produce Abroad\n\nColumbia does not intend to produce on its own in England, Joseph Seidelman, head of the company's foreign department, stated yesterday upon his arrival from a four months' trip in Europe.\n\nHe stated deals have been closed with independent producers to turn out 10 quota pictures for the company. No changes have been made in any of the foreign personnel and no new offices have been opened recently, Seidelman added.\n\nBusiness in England is very good and other countries are progressing and improving every month, he said. Seidelman is holding conferences with Jack Cohn.\n\nWithin the next 60 days \"One Night of Love\" will be shown day and date in 12 important cities of Europe.\n\nFilm Daily, January 11, 1935:\n\nCOLUMBIA TO RELEASE CANADIAN FILM SERIES\n\nColumbia is understood to have signed to handle world distribution of six Northwest Mounted Police stories to be produced in Canada by Kenneth J. Bishop. While the features are to be made as quota films, they will have American stars and will be directed by a Hollywood director. Production will be at the Northern Films studios, Victoria, B.C., with the Royal Canadian Mounted authorities cooperating on details of the stories. First picture, an adaptation of a James Oliver Curwood story, is scheduled for March release.\n\nBishop has returned to Canada after a trip to New York, where he closed the releasing deal and purchased RCA recording equipment.\n\nFilm Daily, January 11, 1935:\n\nGoldburg Gets Interest In Northern Films, Ltd.\n\nJesse J. Goldburg, a pioneer in the independent field, has acquired a substantial interest in Northern Films, Ltd., of Canada, formerly controlled by Kenneth J. Bishop and Col. J. F. Keen, The Film Daily learns. Northern Films has a studio in Victoria, British Columbia, and has produced two British quota films, \"Crimson Paradise\" and \"Black Robe,\" which were acquired by Columbia for distribution in England. Nick Stuart and Lucille Browne head the cast of both films, which will form the nucleus of a program of six pictures, the others to be made in Hollywood. An American company, Northern Films Co., will be formed in California to produce these pictures and handle distribution. Goldburg will be president of this unit and in charge of its activities.\n\nFilm Daily, January 11, 1935:\n\nHirsch Gets \"Secrets of Chinatown\"\n\n\"Secrets of Chinatown,\" first of a series of six mystery melodramas to be made on the coast by Northern Films, Ltd., under supervision of Jesse J.

Judell, Inc., for distribution of \"Secrets of Chinatown\" in this territory. Goldburg has left for the coast to continue production of the remaining pictures in the group of six melodramas being made by Northern Films. \"Crimson Paradise,\" the second, will be released late next month.\n\nFilm Daily, January 21, 1935:\n\nJESSE J. GOLDBURG has arrived back in Hollywood from the east to continue production on the Northern Films series of melodramas.\n\nMotion Picture Herald, February 2, 1935:\n\nColumbia has signed with Kenneth J.

Goldburg, American producer, who is interested in Northern Films, will cooperate with Mr. Bishop in the production of the series.\n\nMotion Picture Daily, April 1, 1935:\n\nBritish Quota Jumps to 20% Levels Today\n\nThis Is Maximum Until Act Ends in 1938\n\nBy Bruce Allan\n\nLondon, March 31.Ã¢Â€Â”One out of every five pictures handled by distributors here must be British-made under the rise in the percentage bracket from 17Â½ per cent to 20 per cent effective upon renters with the advent of April.\n\nThus, the Quota Act which became the law on April 1, 1928, to run for 10 years thereafter reaches its maximum insofar as the selling end of the industry here is concerned. With the two and one-half per cent jump, the 20 per cent bracket remains constant and will continue at its new level until the statute runs its course on March 31, 1938.\n\nAmerican companies in this market, of course, are familiar with the act, its intent and its operation. Designed to foster the British production industry, the impost started modestly at seven and one-half per cent on April 1, 1928, and remained at that figure until March 31, 1929, when it increased to 10 per cent. In April 1, 1932, the bracket rose to 15 per cent, the following year to 17Â½ where it was fixed until the maximum division is reached on Monday.\n\nThe quota, also compulsory on exhibitors, progresses at a slower pace beginning at five per cent for the year ending Sept. 30, 1929, and rising to 20 per cent by Oct. 1 where it will poise itself in the bracket similar to that imposed upon distributors until the act runs out in 1938.\n\nReplying to a question from E. Doran, M.P., in the House of Commons, recently Walter Runciman, president of the Board of Trade, said he did not propose to introduce legislation varying British quotas stipulated by the Cinematograph Films Act.\n\nThe advisory committee under the Act is known to have made suggestions for its amendment for the purpose of controlling \"quickies.\" Legislation for this purpose is not ruled out by the president's reply.\n\nOther questions from Doran, who was prominent in the agitation preceding the passing of the original act, allege attempts on the part of foreign companies to defeat the measure and alluded to \"alien film producers, who, having been put into liquidation in their own countries, were now seeking to exploit the British public.\"\n\nReplying to these points, Sir John Gilmour, Home Secretary, promised to inquire into any facts placed before him.\n\nMotion Picture Daily, April 5, 1935:\n\nCoast-Coast Studio Flight Gets Up Steam\n\nBahamas Latest to Bid; Mayer States Views\n\nEastern studio projects are springing up like dandelions after a spring rain. Virginia, North Carolina and Florida have them and now the Bahamas has produced another for saving money on British quota pictures.\n\nOut on the coast Louis B. Mayer is assuring the public the industry really means to say goodbye.\n\nGovernor Merriam's stratosphere tax program has already lost buoyancy, and if a fin should give way in the oratorical gale nobody would be surprised. The legislative crew might take to the rubber boats on an everyman-for-himself basis.\n\nThe Bahamas project is advanced by Vincent Wray, managing director of British-American Cinema Studios, Inc., who is now in New York from Miami.\n\nThe Bahamas, he says, are a \"logical solution\" of the British quota problem.\n\n\"Up to this time quota pictures have been practically a total loss,\" he asserts, \"due to the fact that they are rarely even shipped to America. At our Nassau studios we will be able to produce quota pictures at approximately one-half the London production cost, due largely to ideal weather conditions. In addition, we will be able to feature American players with box-office names.\"\n\nWray says that in addition to his Nassau plant he is completing a studio at Opalocka, Fla.\n\nFilm Daily, April 5, 1935:\n\nBritish-American Studios Set To Make 16 in Florida\n\nAlso Will Make British Quota Pictures in Nassau\n\nBritish-American Cinema Studios, Inc., is set to start production shortly on a minimum of 16 features to be made for next season at its studios now being completed at Opalocka, Fla., while plans are going ahead for its other studio to be built in Nassau, Bahamas, for the making of pictures qualifying under the British quota, it was announced yesterday by Vincent Wray, managing director of the organization, from his temporary headquarters at the Hotel Taft. Wray said permanent offices would be opened here by his company before he returns south the latter part of the month.\n\nThe British quota films to be in Nassau will be designed for actual showing in both England and the U.S., instead of being made and shelved, said Wray. Nassau's proximity to American talent will make it possible to obtain stars and technicians to give these pictures boxoffice appeal, while weather and other conditions will enable these productions to be made at half the London production cost, according to Wray. He declared major companies here are showing keen interest in the project. The studios are amply financed and will be prepared to either make the quota pictures or rent facilities to producers.\n\nFirst production from the Opalocka plant, situated six miles from Miami, is due for release in October.\n\nFilm Daily, June 19, 1935:\n\nNorthern Films Plans Six\n\nNorthern Films plans to make six features for the 1935-36 season, Jesse Goldburg said yesterday, preliminary to leaving New York today for Hollywood. The company has just completed \"The Fighting Playboy\" for current distribution. First picture on its new program will be \"Trans-Pacific,\" with Heather Angel, Ralph Forbes, Conway Tearle and William Cagney.\n\nGoldburg, on his own, plans to make \"Amateur Radio Revels,\" using amateurs lined up through radio station contests.\n\nFilm Daily, July 12, 1935:\n\nHoffberg-Northern Film Deal\n\nJ. H. Hoffberg Co. has acquired world distribution to Northern Film Production's \"Fighting Playboy,\" with Nick Stuart and Lucille Browne. Jesse J. Goldburg has left New York on a cross-"
