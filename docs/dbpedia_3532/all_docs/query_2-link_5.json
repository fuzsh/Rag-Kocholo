It was the first Hollywood code approved film.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1825, two families, cotton merchants in England and America, with branches in France and Prussia swear to stand by each other in a belief that a great business firmly established in four countries will be able to withstand even such another calamity as the Napoleonic Wars from which Europe is slowly recovering. Then many years later, along comes World War I and the years that follow, to test the businesses.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMadeleine Carroll as Mrs. Warburton, 1825/Mary Warburton Girard, 1914\n\nFranchot Tone as Richard Girard\n\nReginald Denny as Erik von Gerhardt\n\nSig Ruman as Baron von Gerhardt (as Siegfried Rumann)\n\nLouise Dresser as Baroness von Gerhardt\n\nRaul Roulien as Carlos Girard (1825) / Henri Girard (1914)\n\nStepin Fetchit as Dixie\n\nLumsden Hare as Gabriel Warburton (1825) / Sir John Warburton (1914)\n\nDudley Digges as Mr. Manning\n\nFrank Melton as John Girard (1825)\n\nBrenda Fowler as Madame Agnes Girard (1825)\n\nRussell Simpson as Notary (1825)\n\nWalter McGrail as The Duallist (1825)\n\nMarcelle Corday as Madame Girard II (1914)\n\nCharles Bastin as Jacques Girard, the Boy (1914)\n\nBarry Norton as Jacques Girard (1924)\n\nGeorge Irving as Charles Girard (1914)\n\nFerdinand Schumann-Heink as Fritz von Gerhardt\n\nGeorgette Rhodes as Jeanne Girard\n\nClaude King as Colonel Braithwaite\n\nIvan F.
