        "text": "At age 29 and already with more than 50 films to his name (and his other name; Jack), director John Ford was a sure bet of a choice to helm a film the very making of which, would be a voyage into unmapped frontier.\n\n“The Iron Horse” may as well hang alongside a copy of the Louisiana Purchase as a fundamental artifact of Westward expansionism. It is less a narrative story, and more a sweeping portrait of the National Railroad project; infrastructure that would tame the wildness of the territories.\n\nLeaping between competing construction teams on the two eventually intersecting railway lines, “Horse” as a film feels as if you are standing in front of a massive landscape painting, with…\n\nThere are still some rough edges that need to be smoothed out.....but I wonder, if anyone else had directed this, would I be calling it a masterpiece?\n\nSome musings:\n\n- Ford manages to nail the epic here, but doesn't quite nail the intimate. Even so, there are some stunning moments. Look at when the grown-up Davy and the grown-up Miriam meet again! She grabs his hand unconsciously it seems, then they both stare into the distance. Danger leaves, and they finally look at each other, then look down at their hands, separate their hands, and then look off into different spaces. He's already nailed eye-glances. Every once in a while there are incredible tender moments that seem to pop out…\n\nit's so fitting that the most fantastic journey set in the united states of america puts the most focus on the \"united\". in the cinematic landscape of john ford's, there is strength in communication and communion, and there is euphoria in sitting down and having a laugh amongst workers of all races and creeds. no one is superior to the other — not even bosses and their employees, no prejudice to be found — and everybody bands together to conjure up magic in the wild lands of america. there is such a dedication on ford's part to portray the construction of the railway as a miracle of human achievement, almost a moral imperative (because the railway enables telegraphs to communicate…\n\nAlthough John Ford would set the benchmark for the Western genre with Stagecoach, I never realized that fifteen years earlier he already created a lot of the iconography of the genre Ford will forever be associated with. The story of The Iron Horse itself is mediocre at best and basically constitutes a very selective history of American expansionism (with ‘cameos’ by Abraham Lincoln, Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill Hickock). But it is in some of the individual shots and scenes where Ford shows that even with a mostly static camera he already displays at such an early age why he is the master of composition and that even then he manages to create the mythology of the American Western –…\n\nMarch to the West\n\nAbsolute bedrock foundational mythology. The transcontinental railroad as the final tether tying the United States together. Plainly a nationalist text with plenty of outright celebration of Empire, all about how America was originally Made Great, but perhaps locating its patriotism in some unexpected places. The United States is written as a country in conflict between two figures: the optimistic dreamer-laborer, who imagines a better tomorrow built upon train tracks, and the skeptical capitalist-realist, who can't see past the insurmountable barrier of cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThe United States was born on the backs of the brave immigrant laborers who built the railroad, and the corrupt, bloodthirsty capitalist land-barons opposed the Great American Progress at every step, selfishly claiming…\n\n\"It is June, 1862 - and Congress has authorized the simultaneous building of two railroads.\n\nThe Union Pacific is to go west from Omaha, Nebraska. The CENTRAL Pacific (first unit of the Southern Pacific) is to go east from Sacramento, California.\"\n\nCan I tell you about the unbridled JOY that comes with watching Abe Lincoln play matchmaker with small children, run into one of them years later, and express to the woman, \"That was a boy worth waiting for.\" Only to silently stagger off in a judgmental contempt when discovering she's with someone else? I can seriously see Abe watching the bachelor and throwing his stovepipe hat at the TV... \"Peter how could you give a rose to Victoria?!\"\n\nJohn…\n\nFord at his most Griffithian. Except, he keeps getting distracted by the history, the small details of life working on the railroad, the serio-comic ideas of what passes for justice and honor on the margins of society and civilization. Star George O'Brien doesn't even appear until an hour into the film, and Ford barely seems interested in the simple melodrama of his wildly coincidental revenge plot.\n\nWhat resonates is the scale of the production, and the honest belief in the transcontinental railroad as a symbol of national unity and assimilation (at least for the Irish, Italians, Germans, and, kind of, Chinese who built it: African-Americans are wholly absent and the Cheyenne Indians a vague, hostile other). The villain is a…\n\nMy kids go to a summer camp that is a three hour drive from us (it's the camp where my wife went when she was a kid, and she loved it so much that she wanted our kids to have the same experience...and they love it too). While driving up to collect my daughter from camp recently, I started listening to TCM's \"The Plot Thickens\" podcast, specifically the most recent season which was about John Ford.\n\nBy the time I reached camp, I had already decided to dive deeper into Ford's filmography. (It's a great podcast, I highly recommend it. I don't really miss having cable, I barely watched it, but I DO miss seeing Ben Mankiewicz's introductions to classic…\n\nAs one of the opening intertitles reads, the nation was bound north to south by war, east to west by iron. This is a truly epic silent done with location shooting and not controlled sets, with hundreds of extras swarming in frontier towns as the frame charges with their anxiety, hanging around waiting for the official go-ahead to invade Indian territory for gold. That and the corrupt rail officials seen working their ethnically diverse, tense laborers to death to get just one more mile of rail than the other guys paint a grim portrait of American expansionism in a film that nevertheless idealizes the spirit and ambition that made such a project possible. Much less successful is the dragging romance…"
