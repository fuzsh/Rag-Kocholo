Since the documentation of the LGBTQ experience is fragmentary and scattered, it has remained largely inaccessible to researchers, educators, the general public, and even the gay community itself. Through its mission, THP seeks to provide an accurate portrayal of the contributions our community has made to the political, cultural and economic life of the region.",
