        "text": "Advise and Consent (1962) Director: Otto Preminger\n\n“Are you loyal to the United States?”\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nBased on Allen Drury’s classic Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Advise and Consent (1959), Otto Preminger’s film adaptation of the novel delivers a splendid story of democratic debate, senatorial minutia, and political betrayal. It features an all-star cast –Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Don Murray, Walter Pidgeon, Peter Lawford, Gene Tierney, Franchot Tone, Lew Ayres, Burgess Meredith, Eddie Hodges, Paul Ford, George Grizzard, Inga Swenson, Betty White. In some ways, Advise and Consent reminds me of another classic film from the same era, 12 Angry Men (1957). Both films portray an intimate political/legal drama with numerous complex characters carefully weighing the pros and cons of difficult situation, but who nevertheless manage to carry themselves in a dignified manner. These are eminently reasonable, suit-wearing gentlemen who take the burden of governance seriously. The image is so foreign to our own that one cannot help but feel a bit of nostalgia. However, politics is shown to be a dirty business and lurking just beneath this well-mannered veneer is a vicious, cutthroat hunger for power.\n\nClosely matching the plot of the novel, the President of the United States (Franchot Tone) has made a sudden, controversial appointment for Secretary of State, Robert A. Leffingwell (Henry Fonda), a government bureaucrat accused of being a former communist. The situation is reminiscent of Alger Hiss. During his appointment hearing, Leffingwell perjures himself when a surprise witness appears (Burgess Meredith), and causes all manner of headaches for the President’s party, led by Senate Majority Leader Robert “Bob” Munson of Michigan (Walter Pidgeon). The nomination is vociferously opposed by the aging curmudgeon, Senator Seabright “Seab” Cooley (slyly played by Charles Laughton), who has a personal grudge against Leffingwell from a minor committee hearing years ago. In the ruckus, the junior senator from Utah –a family man named Brigham “Brig” Anderson of Utah (Don Murray)—becomes caught in the fray. He is betrayed and blackmailed by his own allies. Dirt is then dug up on a homosexual encounter Brig had while stationed in the army. Whereas in the book, Brig merely has a phone call with this mystery man from years ago (“Ray”), in the movie he tracks down Ray to a gay bar where the innocent young man confesses to needing money hence why he fed the story to Brig’s enemies. Still, with his life in ruins, Brig refuses to back down on the Leffingwell nomination, and a note is sent to his wife containing an incriminating photo and a lover’s letter written by Brig to Ray.\n\nWith this in mind, director Otto Preminger was known to challenge standing film production codes as well as the Hollywood blacklist system at the time. He pushed forward the narrative of a U.S. senator being blackmailed for a homosexual affair despite the censors objections (this was the first Hollywood film after WWII to depict a gay bar scene), and Preminger was also known to cast left-wing actors in prominent roles despite many being blacklisted –for example, he cast cinematic legend Burgess Meredith (who will forever be imprinted in my mind for his roles in The Twilight Zone). Another example is Gene Tierney as the Washington hostess, who has an open affair with Bob Munson while discussing crass things. At the time, actress Gene Tierney was fresh out of rehabilitation after suffering a nervous breakdown (this was her comeback film in Hollywood). Whereas Allen Drury’s original novel strikes a considerably more conservative tone, Preminger’s film adaptation features many memorable jabs at the easy allure of traditionalist proclivities.\n\nAt any rate, Brig is later found dead in his senate office –he kills himself by slicing his own throat. Meanwhile, the President’s health seems to ailing (he is dying) and the recent tragic death of Brig sends shockwaves throughout the senate. Seab Cooley is soon revealed to be the culprit of this vindictive machination. Later, on the floor of the senate, Senator Cooley delivers a somber, apologetic speech though he still intends to oppose the nomination of Leffingwell. The final vote tally involves some wrangling and it ultimately remains tied, leaving the decision down to the Vice President, who surprisingly decides not to vote in the affirmative for Leffingwell, sinking the whole nomination battle. At the same time, the President has suddenly died while in the White House listening to the radio announcement of the hearing. It is an abrupt and unexpected end to this chaotic confirmation battle. The ending to this film is understandably surprising for many viewers, though it is still not quite as explosive as in the novel (in the book, the President is actually the mastermind behind Brig’s suicide, and there are several other deaths and resignations, including Senate Majority Leader Bob Munson’s resignation before later being reinstated when the Vice President delivers a rousing speech upon assuming the presidency –and above all, the final senate vote is overwhelmingly against Leffingwell in the book). At any rate, as a general fan of political tales, I found both the novel and the film to be wonderful.\n\nInterestingly enough, there were some notable cameos in this film: the 87-year-old Henry F. Ashurst, who was one of the first elected senators in the state of Arizona (he served five terms), plays the deeply slumbering Senator John J. McCafferty who must be forcibly awoken in his senate seat in order to shout “Opposed, sir! Opposed!” This little bit of satire was truly delightful (and these senate scenes were apparently shot on the same set used in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). Betty White also makes her film debut in Advise and Consent as the lone female senator from Kansas (in the novel, there was also only one female senator portrayed). Martin Luther King Jr. was uniquely offered a part in the film (though there were no African American senators in the U.S. at this time) so he declined the offer, and Richard Nixon was also offered the role of Vice President in the film, though he apparently grumpily declined, complaining about various errors and holes in the script, namely that the Vice President could not have legally broken the tie in the Senate since, upon the President’s death, he automatically assumes the role of President. Lastly, renowned historian David McCullough appears as a young extra in the film. And sadly, this was Charles Laughton’s final appearance in a film. Both he and Ashurst died shortly before the film’s release.\n\nClick here to return to my film reviews.\n\nClick here to read my reflections on the novel Advise and Consent.\n\nThe Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932) Director: Robert Florey\n\n“Heresy? Do they still burn men for heresy? Then burn me monsieur, light the fire!\n\nDo you think your little candle will outshine the flame of truth?”\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\nOne of the minor classics found within the iconic Monster Movies produced by Carl Laemmle Jr.’s Universal mostly in the 1930s and 1940s, The Murders in the Rue Morgue is loosely based on Edgar Allen Poe’s story of the same name (though it bears several key distinctions from the story). This film was only the third film released in the Monsters series, following Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931), though it is often overlooked.\n\nWith obvious nods to the moody German Expressionist aesthetic of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The Murders in the Rue Morgue features a similar mad scientist running amok but instead of a somnambulist, the monster is an ape (sometimes a real ape, other times an actor in an ape suit). In Paris 1845, young lovers Pierre and Camille enjoy a carnival night at the fairgrounds where they see risqué Arab dancers and Native Americans (who are pitched as “bloodthirsty savages”) before they enter a large tent and are treated to a foreboding scientist’s account of human evolution.\n\nThe evil scientist is Dr. Mirakle, pronounced “Meer-Aaah-Cull” (Bela Lugosi), a biologist who is trying to create a new species, a new half breed of human-ape. He kidnaps innocent women (including a prostitute), injecting them with ape blood which serves as a kind of poison, killing each woman and leaving a trail across the city. There are plenty of goofy moments of levity in this film, but there are also some decidedly horrific moments –censors were keen to block several scenes (especially the slightly disturbing moments wherein Dr. Mirakle straps a prostitute to a giant “X” and stabs her). Bella Lugosi’s character is essentially contains the same mannerisms as his quintessential performance of Dracula (released the prior year). In the end, Mirakle’s ape Erik turns on him as the French police hunt them down in a rooftop chase sequence.\n\nI found The Murders in the Rue Morgue to be another terrific installment in the classic Universal Monster films. Is it as memorable as Dracula or Frankenstein? Decidedly not, but it still a wonderful picture. Interestingly enough, Director Robert Florey left Universal after this film (he previously directed the classic Marx Brothers film The Cocoanuts) and went on to enjoy a lengthy career at Warner Bros –he also directed episodes of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.\n\nClick here to return to my reviews of Universal’s classic monster movies.\n\nClick here to return to my film reviews.\n\nCredits\n\nDirected by: Robert Florey\n\nScreenplay by: Tom Reed and Dale Van Every\n\nBased on: “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” by Edgar Allan Poe\n\nProduced by: Carl Laemmle Jr.\n\nStarring:\n\nBela Lugosi…..Dr. Mirakle\n\nSidney Fox…..Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye\n\nLeon Ames…..Pierre Dupin (as Leon Waycoff)\n\nCinematography: Karl W.

In the war for the Southern Confederacy.”\n\n⭐⭐\n\nRating: 2 out of 5.\n\nBased on Irvin S. Cobb’s comical character Judge Priest, the figures in John Ford’s Judge Priest are described as “familiar ghosts” from Cobb’s own boyhood after the end of the “war between the states” (though he was actually born in the 1870s). The titular role in this film is played by folksy Native American actor, Will Rogers –one of his final roles before his untimely death due to an aviation accident in Alaska the following year in 1935. At the time, Rogers was one of the top paid actors in Hollywood.\n\nStarring Will Rogers, Tom Brown, Henry B. Walthall, Stepin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel (later of Gone with the Wind fame), we meet Circuit Court Judge William “Billy” Pitman Priest (Will Rogers) in the small Kentucky town of Fairfield in the 1890s –his wife Margaret and children have all died. He amusingly reads cartoons in the newspaper during trial. Later, his nephew Rome (Tom Brown) returns to Fairfield after passing the bar and he intends to continue his romance with Ellie May Gillespie (Anita Louise), even though she has been ignoring his letters and they face familial opposition to their union. In turn, a quirky barber named Flem Talley is also courting Ellie. Another character named Bob Gillis (David Landau) runs into scandal and faces a criminal trial which very nearly convicts him until a character testimony is given by Reverend Ashby Brand (Henry B. Walthall), who attests to his courage in the Confederate army. A Dixieland band of black minstrels plays “I Wish I Was In Dixie.” Thus, the film concludes on a triumphant note with a spontaneous parade of Confederate veterans marching through the streets, waving the stars and bars, celebrating the old Confederacy.\n\nThis kind of vulgar propaganda was rife throughout early Hollywood –indeed, actor Henry B. Walthall also played the controversial Little Colonel character in D.W. Griffith’s blatantly racist The Birth of a Nation (arguably the first big Hollywood epic), and Judge Priest likewise portrays the Reconstruction South as essentially a world free of problems, blissful, carefree, with distinguished, noble white southerners lording over child-like black people. The quality of this film is considerably poor and it features more than a few absolutely outrageous racist caricatures which cast a pall over the film. At least Canadian actor Berton Churchill delivers a hilariously aloof performance as Senator Horace Maydew (much like his memorable role as the secretive banker in John Ford’s Stagecoach in 1939). Judge Priest also features impressive editing, particularly in the closing scenes with a Civil War flashback sequence spliced over Reverend Ashby Brand’s rousing courtroom testimony. But with that being said, Judge Priest strikes me as a deeply flawed film that panders to some of the worst instincts in American culture and I would not soon revisit it.\n\nClick here to return to my film reviews.\n\nCredits:\n\nDirected by: John Ford\n\nWritten by: Irvin S.

Daniel Kaluuya plays Otis “OJ” Haywood, Jr. who runs a stunt horse business for Hollywood productions together with his sister Emerald “Em” (Keke Palmer). They train and raise horses on their family ranch in the desert outside Los Angeles –OJ and Em are descendants of one of the first motion picture actors, Alistair E. Haywood, a fictional name based on the first person captured riding a horse (a black man whose true name apparently remains unknown to this day). Since the Haywoods’ Hollywood business has been struggling, OJ and Em have been reluctantly selling their horses to a man named Ricky “Jupe” Park (Steven Yeun), a former child actor on a sitcom called “Gordy’s Home” which ended in tragedy when a chimpanzee named Gordy was suddenly triggered by the sound of exploding balloons and he became incredibly violent, murdering many people on the set except Jupe (Gordy was shot and killed by the police). Notably, Jupe watched this whole violent scene from behind a veil underneath a table. Now, Jupe runs a campy wild west show called the “Star Lasso Experience” where he lures a strange figure in the sky by displaying the Haywoods’ horses.\n\nSoon, it becomes apparent to OJ, Em, and Jupe that a mysterious being is plaguing their ranch –it turns out to be a UFO of sorts. It hides in the clouds for extended periods of time until it grows hungry and then begins feeding on the ranch’s horses (the entity becomes enraged after eating a “decoy” horse statue). The truth of this unusual predatory alien slowly becomes apparent throughout the film, and once OJ and Em learn more about it, they decide to turn it into a cheap marketing stunt by desperately trying to capture it on film. The challenge is that whenever the alien appears, all machinery and electronics are disabled. Thus, they hire an unorthodox cinematographer named Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott) who uses a hand-crank camera in attempt to capture the photograph the film.\n\nHowever, OJ soon discovers that this alien (which he calls “Jean Jacket”) only seems to prey on people who look up at it. The key is to keep your gaze drawn elsewhere, or at least fight the urge to gawk. But what is Jean Jacket? Is it a flying saucer? A giant sand dollar? A balloon? Or a floating aperture? Whatever it is, we love to look at this incredibly strange and mysterious phenomena as it slowly unfurls throughout the movie. We have an obsession with spectacle, perhaps best demonstrated when a masked TMZ reporter suddenly arrives in the hopes of filming another spectacle for money. But even when Jean Jacket is actually filmed, the characters are still unsatisfied. They must film more, to capture it more fully, and in some cases continue filming it while being eaten alive. People want to understand this creature so they can comfortably place it into a box. At the end of the film, Em is finally able to photograph Jean Jacket using vintage technology at the hokey old west town, but only after she entices the creature with a giant balloon of Jupe which it then consumes and immediately chokes to death. In the end, the spectacle has consumed itself.\n\nFilled with homages to classic science fiction, westerns, and horror movies (especially Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jaws), Nope offers a unique social commentary on our cultural obsession with spectacle, especially in the age of the exponential expansion of user-generated content on the internet, driven by pure exploitation. There is a tension in the film between characters either looking away or gawking at something, a frustrating conflict for a horror movie –after all, isn’t a blockbuster movie made for exploitative shock value? To what extent is it selling the artificial experience trauma for the business of spectacle? Or is it so serious that we have to look away? In order to gain fame and success in show business, people must learn to tokenize themselves. For example, Em and Jupe are more successful at selling themselves in Hollywood while OJ is not. He is shy, perhaps not unlike the elusive Jean Jacket, and he is complex –a black cowboy who is socially awkward, perhaps even slightly neurodivergent. But in many ways characters in the film are still pushed into easy boxes and even animals, like chimpanzees or horses, are simply reduced to cheap sideshow clowns in Hollywood. Nope reminds us of the commodification of living things in the entertainment industry –indeed, the very structure of the film is broken out into separate sections featuring cue cards that identify the names of animals who die in each. The synthetic fabrication of myth leaves many casualties. This whole movie offers an intriguing meta contemplation on the nature of blockbuster movie-making, and the many ways in which it exploits both humans and animals. In some ways, Nope seems to be a deeply personal reflection by Jordan Peele on his own craft as a blockbuster movie director. He questions to what extent he, himself, might be tokenized, and made to be a spectacle in the same way that his movies are. How can we avoid such a dire spectacle? Can blockbuster genre movies challenge stereotypes. Nope does not seem to have a definitive answer, but it simply encourages us to look away sometimes.\n\nThus far, I have loved all of Jordan Peele’s movies, and even though Nope is probably my least favorite of his three movies, I still found it to be a compelling cerebral puzzle and I look forward to what he decides to do next.\n\nClick here to return to my film reviews.\n\nClick here for my reviews of Jordan Peele’s films."
