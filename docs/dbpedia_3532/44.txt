This is one of the few Charlie Chan films I have not seen. The reason? It's a lost film. There are no traces of the English speaking version. However, it was the habit of studios in those days to have a Spanish speaking cast and to have them film the same movie using the same sets, etc. so that the movie could be marketed to South America. Of, course the lead would be included and would just repeat their performance where necessary. So, you can see this film on YouTube, but be prepared for subtitles. The character of Charlie Chan appeared in four movies before this, but only as a supporting character, Even in this film, where he is the main character, he doesn't appear until halfway through the film.
