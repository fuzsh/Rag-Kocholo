The hit Toronto play Kim's Convenience, currently on a Canadian tour, is being adapted for the big and small screens.

Thunderbird Films says both a feature film and a TV series based on Toronto playwright-actor Ins Choi's charming stage comedy-drama are in development.

Choi told The Canadian Press in July there was "some [TV] development happening" based on his story of a Korean-Canadian family and its convenience store, but he couldn't provide details.

Kim's Convenience drawing TV interest, Ins Choi says

Tuesday's announcement came as Thunderbird and Soulpepper Theatre Company revealed a multi-year development and production joint venture for TV, feature films and digital media.

Kim's Convenience features a fiery patriarch who is struggling with changes within his business, family and their Toronto community of Regent Park.

It was a smash when it debuted at the 2011 Toronto Fringe Festival, winning the New Play Contest and the Patron's Pick award.

That led to a sold-out showcase and then a remount at the city's Soulpepper Theatre Company, followed by two Dora Award nominations and the Toronto Theatre Critics trophy for best new Canadian play.
