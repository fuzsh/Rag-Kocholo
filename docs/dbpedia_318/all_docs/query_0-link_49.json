        "text": "“BooSnoo! is a special series. There is nothing like it in the market,” said Richard Goldsmith, Thunderbird President of Global Distribution & Consumer Products. “And it’s exactly the kind of property we’re looking to acquire at Thunderbird Distribution. It has great potential to entertain audiences globally and to develop into a brand with its toyetic sets and its star, the little red ball. We applaud Julian for creating, and Sky Kids for commissioning, a series that has the potential to meet the programming needs of neurodiverse kids, but also has very wide appeal to general audiences. Everyone we’ve shown BooSnoo! to finds it fascinating.”\n\n“The response to BooSnoo! was immediate,” said show creator, Julian Bashford. “When the first episodes were released, we received amazing emails from parents on behalf of their children, explaining how much they enjoy the show. Most interesting to me was the lack of words in the show, and the space given with the sounds and the music. It meant that children, including those who speak very little, can relate to the journey that the little red ball was taking. In a world of TV filled with noise, words, character stories and songs, BooSnoo! stands out as a completely original show for ALL children to enjoy.”\n\nBooSnoo! debuted last week at mipjunior in Cannes, France, and ranked as the sixth most-watched show among the more than 600 titles contained in the event’s screening library.\n\nABOUT THUNDERBIRD ENTERTAINMENT GROUP\n\nThunderbird Entertainment Group is a global award-winning, full-service multiplatform production, distribution and rights management company, headquartered in Vancouver, with additional offices in Los Angeles, Toronto, and Ottawa.

The Company develops, produces, and distributes animated, factual, and scripted content through its various content arms, including Thunderbird Kids and Family (Atomic Cartoons), Thunderbird Unscripted (Great Pacific Media) and Thunderbird Scripted.

He has always been interested in the business and creativity of children’s TV, despite not being an artist or writer himself, although he is a musician. Julian setup Visionality to be a creative hub of new and distinctive new IP development, working with talented writers, artists and studios such as Studio Liddell and Mackinnon and Saunders. The aim is to produce show concepts that challenge the mundane, and push the potential of kids TV on from the predictable. BooSnoo! is one of a wide portfolio of shows Julian has now developed solo or with his creative partners, and he is delighted to launch the BooSnoo! to the international markets now in 2023.\n\nABOUT MACKINNON & SAUNDERS\n\nMackinnon & Saunders Ltd is an award-winning animation company based in Manchester, England. Established in 1993 by Ian Mackinnon and Peter Saunders, the company has had an illustrious career working on a wide variety of projects ranging from short films to world class feature films. Originally the company specialised in creating stop-motion puppets for children’s animated TV, the most famous of which was the global phenomenon, Bob the Builder. In 1995, the company was approached by Tim Burton to create characters for his live action/ stop motion feature film, Mars Attacks. Subsequently, the company worked with Burton on his animated features The Corpse Bride and Frankenweenie. Other feature work includes Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr Fox and Guillermo del Toro’s Oscar-winning Pinocchio. In 2012, the company opened its own studios providing animation services for such companies as the BBC, Netflix, NBC Universal, ITV, Warner Bros and ad agency, Saatchi & Saatchi.
