        "text": "Canadian prodco Thunderbird Films is continuing its M&A streak, making yet another acquisition to broaden its business portfolio.\n\nThe Vancouver-based company announced today the acquisition of Vancouver animation studio Atomic Cartoons.\n\nAtomic Cartoon founders and partners Mauro Casalese, Rob Davies, Trevor Bentley and Rob Simmons will stay on following the acquisition and will continue to lead the Atomic team. Atomic Cartoons will continue to operate out of its established offices, and no layoffs are anticipated. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThis latest move follows Thunderbird’s December 2014 acquisition of Vancouver-based factual producer Great Pacific Media. Thunderbird also acquired London-based indie distributor Soda Pictures in fall 2014. In 2013, the prodco picked up Reunion Pictures to get into the scripted TV space, following its 2012 pact with Lionsgate to form Sea to Sky studios as a 50/50 joint-venture.\n\nAtomic Cartoon’s portfolio of series includes Pirate Express, Atomic Betty and Nico Can Dance!\n\nFrom Playback"
