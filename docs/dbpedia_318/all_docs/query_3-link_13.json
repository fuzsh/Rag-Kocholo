Built in 1941, the site was designed by artist Millard Sheets to resemble the mythical Thunderbird from the air. The control tower formed the feathered tail of the bird, the administration buildings and barracks formed its body, the hangars its wings, and the gardens its head. The installation was situated on the southeast corner of what is now West Greenway Road & North 59th Avenue. Contractor Del Webb Construction built a hexagonal barracks, an administrative building, a mess hall, and four hangars on the site, as well as two swimming pools.\n\nFrom 1941 â€“ 1945, more than 16,000 cadets were trained at Thunderbird Field No. 1. At the conclusion of the War, Thunderbird Field No. 1 was sold by the Army as wartime surplus. The American Institute of Foreign Trade, later to become Thunderbird School of Global Management, was established on the site in 1946 and is now a part of the Arizona State University system."
