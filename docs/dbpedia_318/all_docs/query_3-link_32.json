        "text": "Known as the ‘Sistine of the South’, the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist is a stunning backdrop to the opening scene of Disney’s 2019 rendition of \"Lady & The Tramp.\" Visitors can walk through the lovely Lafayette Square and take a tour of the chapel during visiting hours.\n\nWhile a big portion of the 2019 action-packed movie \"Gemini Man\", featuring Will Smith, was filmed in the small town of Glennville, Georgia (about 60 miles west of Savannah), there are some memorable scenes that could only be portrayed in the beautiful neighborhood of Isle of Hope, located in Savannah's Moon River District. Drive through oak-lined gravel streets and watch the sunset over the marsh in this beautifully-preserved southern neighborhood.\n\nTybee Island, Savannah’s Beach, was transformed into a major Hollywood set for the 2017 \"Baywatch\" film featuring Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, Zac Efron and Priyanka Chopra. Most notably, the Tybee Island Pier takes center stage for a majority of the comedic film. We think the slow motion running down the beach makes for a great chance to spot your favorite dining and shops along Tybee's South Beach!\n\nThe Oscar winning 1989 film, \"Glory,\" features many iconic Savannah movie locations. Starring Denzel Washington, Matthew Broderick and Morgan Freeman, this feature film showcases the Roundhouse Complex at the Georgia State Railroad Museum as well as the Mercer Williams House and Battlefield Memorial Park. As part of the Savannah History Museum, visitors can walk the grounds and learn the history of the Revolutionary War in Savannah.\n\nWhen filming couldn’t be relocated to France, the producers of the 2019 film \"Ford v. Ferrari\" took production to Hutchinson Island, located just north of downtown Savannah over the Talmadge Bridge. The island served as a stand-in for the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans, France when the race track was transformed for their recount of the 1966 Grand Prix. Watch in awe as Matt Damon and Christian Bale race through this action-packed movie!"
