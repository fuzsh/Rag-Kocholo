A coalition of Canadian independent media producers, this new industry initiative will empower producers in taking measurable action against climate change through collaboration, resource and knowledge sharing, formal commitments, and annual reporting.\n\nAs producers face a tidal wave of growing pressure to be sustainable, Producing for the Planet unites producers from across the country, including some of the industry’s most influential companies, in their mission to make the Canadian media industry a leading force for positive environmental change. The producer-led coalition will focus on accelerating the adoption of sustainable production practices as well as the production of sustainability-focused content that inspires action and informs audiences.\n\n‍\n\n“Producers face many barriers to changing business-as-usual practices, yet change we must.

At Thunderbird, we want to be part of the solution and inspire others to join us in creating a sustainable production industry,\" said Sarah Nathanson, COO & GC, Thunderbird Entertainment.\n\n‍\n\n“There is nothing greater facing humanity than the challenge of climate change,” said Christina Jennings, Chairman and President, Shaftesbury. “As leaders in the industry, we can force change.
