        "text": "The Thunderbird Drive-In in Marysville, WA. officially opened on May 1, 1959. According to an article (above) in the April 30, 1959 Marysville Globe newspaper, the drive-in featured a panoramic screen, a children’s playground and would be open seven nights a week during the season.\n\nOpening films that weekend were “My Man Godfrey” starring David Niven and June Allison, and “Man of the West” starring Gary Cooper and Julie London.\n\nThe drive-in, with a capacity of 500 vehicles, drew movie-goers from around the county for 33 years – the next closest drive-in theaters being the Everett Motor Movie at 75th & Evergreen Way, and the Skagit Drive-In in Burlington.\n\nAt the time, the Thunderbird’s address was simply “three miles north of Everett at the Marysville cloverleaf,” also known as the intersection of Highway 99 and the Tulalip Highway (SR 528), and now known as 33rd Avenue NE & 66th Avenue NE (Interstate 5 between north Everett and Marysville didn’t officially open until 1969).\n\nEventually the Thunderbird Drive-In succumbed to rising real estate values and declining patronage, as most drive-ins did by the 1980’s and 1990’s. It closed forever in November 1992. An automobile and RV dealership occupied the land which by 2023 is a Wendy’s restaurant and and RV Dealership.\n\nContributed by Andrea Miller"
