        "text": "Last week, a local movie producer and celebrated actor was given the rare distinction of being a clue on the television game show Jeopardy. The clue was: Born in Moore, Oklahoma in 1981, Randy Wayne starred as Boâs cousin Luke in the 2007 TV Movie Titled ______: The Beginning. The answer was The Dukes of Hazzard. The mention was a fun flashback for Wayne, who now spends as much time working behind the camera to produce movies here in Oklahoma as he does appearing on screen.Â Â\n\nRandy Wayne is an Emmy-nominated actor who graduated from Moore High School, moved to Hollywood after college, and starred in more than 100 feature films and television series. During his 18 years in Los Angeles, he rose from television guest star to series regular to lead actor in multiple series and movies. Now that Wayne is based in Oklahoma, he has stayed in demand as an actor, with six films coming out later this year, including the presidential biopic, Reagan.Â\n\nWayne is also a multi-faceted producer, providing a wide variety of services for independent feature films. He has produced 27 films, including Road to the Open, Trust Me, and the Oklahoma made Rudderless, directed by William H. Macy.\n\nWayne moved back to Oklahoma in 2019 with his producing partner Talia Bella to launch Thunderbird Films. Their goal was to combine their experiences working in Los Angeles and create a production company that supports filmmakers coming to Oklahoma to film. They also wanted to provide a bridge between actors and crew members working in Oklahoma and visiting productions. Since then, they have gotten married, had a child, and produced several movies each year in both Oklahoma City and Tulsa.Â\n\nTalia Bella was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and studied media and communications at the University of Buenos Aires. Bella has produced more than 100 commercials, music videos, short films, and features. She also produced several television series, including the Emmy-nominated series Making a Scene with James Franco, Season 2.Â\n\nSince starting Thunderbird Films, Wayne and Bella have produced twelve feature films together. Their first was the independent hit Wild Indian, starring Jesse Eisenberg, which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and picked up four Independent Spirit Award nominations. Since then, they have become one of the most trusted producing teams in Oklahoma. They have produced several films for the Lifetime network. And, their holiday hit, A Christmas Present, helped launch the new Great American Network.Â Â\n\nI recently sat on a film producing panel with Talia Bella at the University of Oklahoma. She told the story of how she and Randy moved here to create Thunderbird Films and become a part of the Oklahoma film industry. It was magical to hear how positive and fruitful their experience has been. And, it was the perfect message to inspire those great college students to stay here and make their movies in Oklahoma.Â"
