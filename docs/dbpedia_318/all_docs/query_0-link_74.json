Additionally, with the great alignment of our relationship with Thunderbird, we are looking forward to seeing this brand's growth,\" commented Brenda Bisner, CCO at A Parent Media Co. Inc. (owner of Kidoodle.TV).\n\n\"We are excited to be bringing this entertaining show to our HappyKids audience,\" said David Di Lorenzo, SVP of Kids & Family, Future Today. \"The uniqueness of the live-action animal characters Mittens and Pants are sure to be a hit with kids and their families.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled and humbled that Mittens & Pants is being so well-received around the world,\" said series creator and CEO of Windy Isle Entertainment, Phil McCordic. \"We are overjoyed to be working with such amazing partners and can't wait to launch in the U.S. market.\"\n\nThe series is produced by Toronto-based Windy Isle Entertainment, with the participation of the Canada Media Fund and the assistance of Ontario Creates and the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit, and with the financial participation of the Shaw Rocket Fund.\n\nSee more Mittens & Pants on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook via @mittensandpantstv and at @mittensandpantsofficial on YouTube.
