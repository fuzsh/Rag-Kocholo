Firewater Thunderbird Rising will open with Path Without End, a 10-minute documentary dance film that witnesses Christine Friday’s family taking back their power from Shingwauk residential school and speaking their truth on their traditional tribal family hunting territory.\n\nFirewater Thunderbird Rising was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Individual and for Outstanding Original Choreography at the 2022 Dora Mavor Moore Awards.\n\nTemagami First Nation-Anishinaabe Kwe Christine Friday is a proficient resilient Indigenous storyteller, and the recipient of the 2018 K.M.

She is deeply connected to the cultural wellness of her people and works hard to maintain cultural traditions and gifts of her Anishinaabek community.\n\nChristine Friday’s company Friday Creeations, based on Bear Island Lake Temagami, is a First Nations professional arts and community platform that encourages creative entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency that connects to land, power and truth.
