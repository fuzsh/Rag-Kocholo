        "text": "k***@verizon.net\n\nHi Jeff, David, and everyone interested in my 2-sense,\n\nThere was yet another home movie distributor based in New York called\n\nEntertainment Films, that had all the excitement in their periodic\n\ncatalogs that Blackhawk had, but generally of such exotic and unknown\n\nsilent wonders that had yet to be fully documented in what few books\n\nthere were on film history at that time. It was the UNcommon names\n\nlike Louise Glaum, Laura LaPlante, Mae Busch, Lupino Lane, Larry Semon,\n\nFred Thompson et.al. that really raised the curiosity level of this\n\npre-teenager to unexpected heights. I was well acquainted with Laurel\n\n& Hardy and fiercely loved their films from the occasional TV showings,\n\nbut actually OWNING an 8mm print of \"Oranges & Lemons\" with Stan sans\n\nBabe was a thrill beyond belief, and a feeling I have very rarely\n\nexperienced since that time long ago. This of course was WAY before\n\nhome video and dvd, and waiting for the next TV showing of KING KONG\n\nseemed like an eternity.\n\nI was SO obsessed that I demanded, and got, a job with Thunderbird\n\nFilms in late 1974. I got to know Tom Dunnahoo pretty well, he was a\n\nvery complex guy and did have a demon or two chasing him, but in\n\ngeneral I think his heart was in the right place. One tidbit I have to\n\nshare:\n\nThe FBI was ever eager to bust him for copyright infringement, and paid\n\nmany unannounced visits to both the lab and the warehouse. Attempts\n\nwere made to coerce employees to share any information they might have\n\nwith promise of immunity, negatives were sometimes seized and later\n\nreturned for lack of enforcement, \"plants\" were sent in to attempt\n\npurchasing GONE WITH THE WIND, or JAWS, or whatever they though could\n\nmake a charge stick, everything without success. The last straw was a\n\nrelentless series of \"cease and desist\" orders from various studios'\n\nlegal offices, usually regarding known public domain titles like MEET\n\nJOHN DOE. Well, good old Tom had had enough. He ordered an\n\nextra-large type custom rubber stamp with just one word, and repeatedly\n\nstamped it on every successive legal \"request\" that came his way, and\n\nmailed them back to whatever studio that sent it. The ploy apparently\n\nworked as the harassment did taper off to almost nothing after a while,\n\nand I had to admire his chutzpah. Oh yeah, the word on the rubber\n\nstamp was \"bullshit\".\n\nHe wound up serving a seven-year prison sentence on what I still\n\nbelieve was a trumped-up charge, one that, because of its vile and\n\nheinous implications, I will not divulge. I personally think it was\n\npart retribution for giving the authorities the figurative finger. He\n\nnever was charged with copyright infringement, and came out of\n\nconfinement a very broken man who could walk only with the use of a\n\ncane. I saw him once more about 1985 or 86 just before he moved back\n\nto his native Texas, and was told he passed away about 5 years later.\n\nAll the Thunderbird negatives were controlled by Tom's ex-wife Terry,\n\nand she placed them with Dermot Morgan, who was Tom's head technician\n\nand my mentor, when he opened Morcraft Films for business in 1980. He\n\ncontinued making the catalog titles available in super 8 and 16mm\n\nprints, and expanded the library with many more rarities. It was a\n\ngreat place to be for a few years, but after his only son was killed in\n\na motorcycle accident, he became very bitter and impossible to work for\n\nso I had to move on.\n\nAfter Morgan (as he preferred to be called) became ill in the late\n\n80's, his business acumen was failing badly. Had I known then, I would\n\nhave returned to help as he was very generous to me with his knowledge\n\nand I genuinely cared for the man. Never a particularly good judge of\n\ncharacter, he had allowed some real creepy and dishonest people to\n\ninfiltrate both his business and his home - I saw him as a defendant on\n\nan episode of TV's \"The People's Court\" facing a charge of sex\n\ndiscrimination against one of his boarders - and when he was reduced to\n\ndependency on a mobile oxygen tank, the doors were wide open and some\n\nof these scum-balls took everything that could be carried. I have heard\n\nthat most of the negatives, many of which I had made, wound up with a\n\ncompany called Barr Films (allegedly as collateral against money Morgan\n\nhad borrowed from the owner), and their present location and state of\n\ncondition is unknown to me. There were so many unique and invaluable\n\ntitles in that collection, such as a Mack Sennett one-reel sound short\n\ncalled THE BLUFFER with Andy Clyde shot in 2-strip color in 1930, and\n\nunfortunately they just might be beyond salvage now. It's likely that\n\nno one will ever know.\n\nBut it was a grand time while it lasted, and I feel fortunate indeed to\n\nhave been so closely involved with what I truly love\n\nKingsley Candler (with apologies for being somewhat off-topic)\n\nVitaphone\n\nMy pleasure, Ed! I actually surprised myself at how much I remembered, especially as I hadn't thought about it in years.\n\nYes, Willoughby-Peerless is still in business, although I believe the store is somewhat smaller than it used to be... or at least it seemed so the last time I walked by.\n\nCoincidentally, Eumig was also my first s8s projector and it was bought at Willoughby's. Although very expensive for the time, my Dad justified the purchase since he was a camera buff himself and took loads of home movies. What a heavy, well-made strong projector it was too!! (Grey, black and white metal, as I recall.) Then too, there were a few times when minor repairs were needed and we had to make the long, long drive to Lake Success, NY to drop the projector off at what was likely Eumig's only East Coast headquarters. Twice, they repaired the unit while we waited so we wouldn't have to come back (like that would ever happen today!) and I still remember that the repairman/technician's name was \"Otto,\" and that to test the unit they kept on hand a s8s Woody Woodpecker cartoon. :)\n\nI eventually graduated to one of those Elmo units that took 2,400' reels... but I was always happier with that rock solid Eumig.\n\nJeff\n\nPost by Cubear\n\nOh my god ...\"Willoughby Peerless\"...my Mecca...! You are exactly\n\nright, that was the store I was remembering, Is it still there?? Your\n\ndescription was 100 percent right on to the last detail and brought all\n\nthe memories back. That's the store my dad brought me to purchase my\n\nfirst Dual 8 sound projector, a Eumig (is that how you spell it). And\n\nhow you were right on in your description of the about the Film Dept.\n\nThe glass case with all the L and H pink boxes lined up on the bottom\n\nand I think the Castle Films on the top shelves facing out. And you\n\nare absolutely right about the nice salesman. They were so willing to\n\ntalk and to put up with a little 14 year old kid who would brows the\n\ndept for hours, window shopping and putting together lists of purchases\n\nfor the next year asking questions and looking at the boxes of film\n\nlike they were the crown jewels.\n\nGeez..Thanks for the memories!!\n\nEd"
