Her passion is teaching and advocating for widespread naloxone distribution.\n\nTahl was born in Jerusalem Israel and after moving around the globe (South Africa, Germany, Egypt) with her family in the 80’s, they settled in Winnipeg where they quickly gained friendships, connections, and common ground within the First Nations communities in both Winnipeg and rural Manitoba. Tahl says “having a funny sounding name (My name was Tahl Hamizrachi), not speaking the English language and being a minority made the move across the ocean challenging, to say the least.”\n\nTahl’s parents were employed within a Tribal Council, in a Northern-Remote First Nation realizing a strong sense of community and honouring of Elders and teachers. Because her family also shared the experience of historical trauma and discrimination, she learned about the need to stand in solidarity to face the Canadian truth. Parallels of suffering, cultural genocide, resilience, and pride, as well as common roots, history, vision and goals shaped her views and support the work she does in education, harm reduction and mental wellness.\n\nOutside of work Tahl is a Kookum to two little girls, mother to a team of beautiful biological, step and foster children; and wife to her best friend and owner of a livestock sanctuary. She can often be found with her horses, cows, alpacas, and goats.\n\nTara Vanderveer is an Instructional Design/Development Specialist for Thunderbird Partnership Foundation.
