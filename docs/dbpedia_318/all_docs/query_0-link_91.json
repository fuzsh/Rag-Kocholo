        "text": "programming release\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nGet ready for a spectacular movie extravaganza: TIFF Bell Lightbox's Magnificent 70mm revival with Oppenheimer, Boogie Nights, and beyond!\n\nMetropolitan, The Shop Around the Corner, Sing-a-Long-a with The Sound of Music, and exclusive screenings with TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey\n\nExperience movie magic like never before with an Ernst Lubitsch retrospective and more!\n\nTORONTO — Today, TIFF is proud to unveil a full programming slate of the most anticipated New Releases, rare retrospectives, and holiday classics coming to the TIFF Bell Lightbox this December.\n\nFrom the Collection returns with Member-exclusive 35mm screenings of The Piano and Dust in the Wind with TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey. Reviving a beloved TIFF tradition, Magnificent 70mm presents a slate of rare 70mm prints this holiday season including favourites like Boogie Nights, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and this summer’s box office spectacular Oppenheimer from Christopher Nolan. TIFF is one of the few theatres in Toronto where audiences can watch classics on 70mm and celebrate the way these films were meant to be seen. This series is generously supported by Jennifer Tory.\n\nTIFF Cinematheque will also celebrate German filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch with a new retrospective, The Lubitsch Touch, featuring rare 35mm prints. An exceptional example of a filmmaker whose career began in the silent era and who transitioned with apparent ease into the talkies, Lubitsch is best known for sophisticated films with a dry wit and modern sense of humour, a quality that later became known as the “Lubitsch touch”.\n\nJust in time for the holidays are celebratory and participatory singalong events from Sing-a-Long-a, featuring special screenings of The Sound of Music and The Greatest Showman. On December 16 from 6–8pm in Varda, there will also be a special musical performance to bring in the holidays. Raoul Bhaneja and Tyler Yarema, veterans of the Toronto swing and blues scenes, will perform a special duo show at Varda, showcasing both artists on vocals, accompanied by Yarema’s deft piano stylings.\n\nAs part of December’s festive programming are a Q&A with filmmaker Whit Stillman for the screening of his cult classic and ultimate winter-break film Metropolitan; Coopers’ Christmas with Canadian filmmaker Warren Sonoda in attendance; and Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nIn addition, TIFF Bell Lightbox will be showing New Releases fresh off their run at the 48th Toronto International Film Festival, including Kore-eda Hirokazu’s Monster (Cannes 2023 Winner, Queer Palm and Best Screenplay), and Ava DuVernay’s Origin (Venice 2023 Nominee, Golden Lion Best Film). And, see the highly anticipated exclusive release of Bradley Cooper’s Maestro at TIFF Bell Lightbox, and Zack Synder’s exclusive limited run of the epic sci-fantasy Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire in 70mm. TIFF Bell Lightbox is one of four theatres screening the film in the world.\n\nTIFF CINEMATHEQUE\n\nFrom the Collection | tiff.net/fromthecollection\n\nThese screenings are exclusively available to TIFF Members.
