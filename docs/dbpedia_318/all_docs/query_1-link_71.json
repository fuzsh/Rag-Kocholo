        "text": "SOHOME HORROR FEST: SHOCKDOWN SATURDAYS - Week Two\n\nA slow, brooding crime procedural with an interesting occult edge. The thing which stood out to me most about Thunderbird was the way that it used short bursts of truly striking horror imagery; a murder victim with their face covered in red wax, a ghostly shamanic figure in ritual dress flashing up in certain sequences, and most notably one incredible effects sequence towards the end which I'm not even going to go into. Thunderbird isn't really a horror movie per se, more just an effective mystery-thriller with an edge of the supernatural, and these glimpses of dark, ritualistic imagery really add to the atmosphere that this film is trying to convey.\n\nTo…\n\nTypically, I'm not a fan of slow burn films. This starts out the serial killer procedural and goes if very different direction . The film has buys itself a lot credits in the first hours so when it takes unexpected turn I was still happy to go the with it .\n\n\"Thunderbird leans heavily into the mystery and the family drama, which propels the story forward and makes the film more palpable for general audiences but those that prefer something a bit more challenging will appreciate the underlying themes Treeshin incorporates into the film as well as the movie’s more mystical underpinnings which lead to a truly horrific moment in the final act.\"\n\nFestival review:\n\nwww.quietearth.us/articles/2019/12/WFF2019-Mysticism-Meets-Thriller-in-THUNDERBIRD\n\nI feel like I have been saying this a lot lately but this movie surprised me. I saw it on Tubi and thought \"ok a bad giant killer bird movie, should be some dumb fun to unwind to while my baby gets a few hours in on a nap\" instead I get a well acted mystery serial killer thriller with an ominous tone of the possibility of a giant killer bird. They developed the tension well, kept the mystery moving along and evolving. My only major gripe is the way they decided to end it, to me it would have worked better if they kept it more vague and possibly non supernatural/mythical. Still this is well worth the watch if you enjoy the true crime genre.\n\nMmm, yeah…\n\nI really, really wanted to like this movie. First off I so love me a good creature feature & this movie had such excellent potential ( only to be torpedoed by a poorly written script, badly researched police procedures, kinda essential for a movie that describes itself as being in large part a police procedural, duh…)crappy acting and equally crappy actors.\n\nSo much is left unexplained, lots of opportunities to keep us grounded in the unwavering structure of real world rigidity are wasted in lieu of disjointed, half baked, barely explored mystical and mythological themes. That “the white devil is now our brother” ceremony at the very end for example…wtf? Come on folks, a dead ferret headdress is just…\n\nA reclusive young fisherman goes looking for his missing sister in the rugged Pacific Northwest. Haunted by a recurring nightmare, his family’s murky history with First Nations locals puts his life in jeopardy. A newly reinstated detective is sent from the city to work a homicide. When the body turns out to be his sister’s roommate, he and the detective cross paths, and together they follow clues to catch a killer.\n\nNow streaming!\n\nThis movie showed up on Tubi and I watched the trailer, it peaked my interest. It takes its time, but I'm fine with that. One problem is that there are so many movies that do look like this now that it's almost the standard. Great looking drone shots for establishing shots, but, again, typical of today's movies. The movie does suffer from too many conflicts, especially near the end. The creature design is not great, and closely resembles a xenomorph. I did like this movie and it kept my attention the entire time.\n\nI wouldn't say that this is bad i just think it kinda fumbled what it was going for in the last 10 minutes or so. but before that happens i think its actually pretty good\n\nI am not a huge fan of police procedurals, though a few exceptions exist. Thunderbird seemed like it might have been an exception, until it wasn't. I can't decide if it was an episode of a TV show that ran too long or a miniseries that was edited too short, but it was missing something. And, like a lot of films, it flubs the end badly. I won't spoil it, but the ending is illogical, trying to merge cultural reconciliatiom with a grim finale that seems incompatible. The movie is, to its credit, shot beautifully, and it builds an interesting premise, but overall fails."
