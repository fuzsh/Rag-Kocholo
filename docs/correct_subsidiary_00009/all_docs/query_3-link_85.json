        "text": "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company\n\nSiebel Systems, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a leading provider of business applications software. Siebel eBusiness Applications are a family of enterprise applications software that enables an organization to better manage its most important relationships: its customer, partner and employee relationships. Siebel eBusiness Applications are designed to meet the information system requirements needed to manage these relationships for organizations of all sizes, from small businesses to the largest multinational organizations and government agencies. The Company's customer relationship management (\"CRM\") applications enable an organization to sell to, market to, and serve its customers across multiple channels and lines of business. The Company's employee relationship management applications enable an organization to drive employee and organizational performance and increase employee satisfaction through the support of each stage of the employee life cycle.\n\nSiebel eBusiness Applications also include integration and business intelligence (otherwise known as analytics) applications that help organizations more fully leverage the value of their corporate information. The integration applications allow organizations to share data and processes among different software applications, while the analytics applications make it possible to analyze large volumes of corporate data quickly and easily.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that the Company make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns, fair value of investments, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, restructuring obligations, and contingencies and litigation, among others. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management with respect to these items and other items that require management's estimates.\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nThe Company considers the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries to be the local currency, and accordingly, the foreign currency is translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at period end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for the results of operations. Adjustments resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions are recognized in current operations and have not been significant to the Company's operating results in any period presented.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency contracts utilized to offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses, was $13,151,000 as of December 31, 2003. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments is reflected in \"prepaids and other\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. Marketable equity securities include the Company's investments in publicly traded companies in the high technology industry. The Company has classified its short-term investments and marketable equity securities as \"available-for-sale.\" Such investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax effects, reported within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are computed using the specific identification method.\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of short-term investments, trade accounts receivable and financial instruments used in foreign currency hedging activities. The Company primarily invests its excess cash in money market instruments, government securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. The Company is exposed to credit risks related to its short-term investments in the event of default or decrease in credit-worthiness of one of the issuers of the investments. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as the majority of the Company's customers are large, well-established companies. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, but historically has not experienced any significant losses related to any particular industry or geographic area since the Company's business is not concentrated on any one particular customer or customer base.\n\nNo single customer accounts for more than 10% of revenues for any period presented, and the Company's customers, which are primarily in the high technology, telecommunications, financial services (including insurance), pharmaceutical, public sector and consumer packaged goods industries, are sufficiently diverse that the Company does not consider itself significantly exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The counterparties to agreements relating to the Company's foreign currency contracts are large, multinational financial institutions. The amounts subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed the obligations of the Company to that counterparty.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capital lease amortization is included with depreciation expense, and the associated accumulated amortization of $9,025,000 and $21,808,000 as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively, is included with accumulated depreciation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years, or the lease term, if applicable. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, generally seven years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired are removed from the respective property accounts, and the gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nOn January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 \"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations\" (SFAS 143\"), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.\n\nAll of the Company's existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to the original condition upon lease termination. As of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $1,834,000 long-term asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements. This amount represents the net present value of the expected future cash flows associated with returning certain of the Company's leased properties to original condition. The Company's remaining expected future cash flows required to fulfill its long-term asset retirement obligations of $1,869,000 is reflected in \"capital lease obligations and other, long-term\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003.\n\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued SFAS No. 141 \"Business Combinations\" (\"SFAS 141\") and SFAS No. 142 \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" (\"SFAS 142\") in July 2001. SFAS 141 specifies criteria for recognizing and reporting intangible assets apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that intangible assets with an indefinite life should not be amortized until their life is determined to be finite, and all other intangible assets must be amortized over their useful life. SFAS 142 also requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142 at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events (see \"Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" below).\n\nThe Company adopted certain provisions of these pronouncements effective July 1, 2001, as required for goodwill and intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. The Company adopted the remaining provisions of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. There was not a cumulative transition adjustment upon adoption as of July 1, 2001 or January 1, 2002. SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 required the Company to perform the following as of January 1, 2002: (i) review goodwill and intangible assets for possible reclassifications; (ii) reassess the lives of intangible assets; and (iii) perform a transitional goodwill impairment test. Based on this review, the Company determined: (i) that it does not have any amounts that were required to be reclassified from goodwill to identifiable intangibles, or vice versa, (ii) the original estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets remain appropriate, and (iii) that it did not have a transitional impairment of goodwill.\n\nAs required by SFAS 142, the Company has not amortized goodwill associated with acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001, for any period presented, and ceased amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001, effective January 1, 2002. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company amortized goodwill over a period of three to five years using the straight-line method.\n\nIdentifiable intangibles consist of \"acquired technology\" and customer relationships. The acquired technology intangible assets are being amortized over a period of fourteen months to three years using the straight-line method and the customer relationship intangible asset is being amortized over a period of six years based on customer attrition rates, currently estimated at approximately 30% per year of the remaining acquired customers. Please refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the \"reporting unit\" level (\"Reporting Unit\") at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined by SFAS 142. Consistent with the Company's determination that it has only one reporting segment as defined in SFAS No. 131 \"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,\" the Company has determined that it has only one Reporting Unit, specifically the license, implementation and support of its software applications. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on July 1 in a two-step process. First, the Company determines if the carrying amount of its Reporting Unit exceeds the \"fair value\" of the Reporting Unit, which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. If the Company determines that goodwill may be impaired, the Company compares the \"implied fair value\" of the goodwill, as defined by SFAS 142, to its carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment loss. The Company does not have any goodwill that it considers to be impaired.\n\nOn January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144 \"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\" (\"SFAS 144\"). There was not a cumulative transition adjustment upon adoption. In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company evaluates long-lived assets, including intangible assets other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\n\nContingent Liabilities\n\nThe Company has a number of unresolved regulatory, legal and tax matters, as discussed further in Notes 6 and 10. The Company provides for contingent liabilities in accordance with SFAS No. 5 \"Accounting for Contingencies\" (\"SFAS 5\"). In accordance with SFAS 5, a loss contingency is charged to income when: (i) it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies that do not meet both those conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized.\n\nPeriodically, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure. If a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated as defined by SFAS 5, the Company reflects the estimated loss in its results of operations. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. Further, estimates of this nature are highly subjective, and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates accordingly. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n\nAccounting for and Disclosure of Guarantees\n\nIn November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 \"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others\" (\"Interpretation 45\"). Interpretation 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit, and provides new disclosure requirements regarding indemnification provisions, including indemnification provisions typically included in a software license arrangement. It also clarifies that at the time a guarantee is issued, the Company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee do not apply to product warranties, indemnification provisions in the Company's software license arrangements, or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure requirements were effective as of December 31, 2002. The adoption of Interpretation 45 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company accounts for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method, as prescribed by APB No. 25 \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\" and interpretations thereof (collectively referred to as \"APB 25\"). Accordingly, the Company records deferred compensation costs related to its employee stock options when the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of each stock option on the date of grant. The Company records and measures deferred compensation for stock options granted to non-employees, other than members of the Company's Board of Directors, based on the fair value of the stock options. Deferred compensation is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related stock option. The Company did not grant any stock options at exercise prices below the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant during 2001, 2002 and 2003.\n\nAs of December 31, 2002 and 2003, the Company's deferred compensation balances primarily related to stock awards issued in the fourth quarter of 2002 and the remaining unamortized portion of compensation expense associated with stock options granted by certain acquired companies and converted under the terms of the agreements between the Company and the companies acquired. The Company is amortizing the deferred compensation on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting periods, which is generally five years.\n\nAn alternative method to the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based compensation is the fair value approach prescribed by SFAS No. 123 \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,\" as amended by SFAS No. 148 \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure\" (collectively referred to as \"SFAS 123\"). If the Company followed the fair value approach, the Company would be required to record deferred compensation based on the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock option is required to be computed using an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes option valuation model, at the date of the stock option grant. The deferred compensation calculated under the fair value method would then be amortized over the respective vesting period of the stock option.\n\nAs required by SFAS 123, the Company has prepared a reconciliation of its net income (loss) as reported on the statement of operations to the net income (loss) that the Company would have reported if it had followed SFAS 123 in accounting for its stock-based compensation arrangements. For purposes of this reconciliation, the Company added back all stock-based employee compensation expense recorded in accordance with APB 25 in the statement of operations, then deducted the stock-based employee compensation expense determined under SFAS 123. Summarized below are the pro forma effects on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share data, as if the Company had elected to use the fair value approach prescribed by SFAS 123 to account for its employee stock-based compensation plans (in thousands, except per share data):\n\nYear Ended December 31, ------------------------------------ 2001 2002 2003 ---------- ------------ ------------ Net income (loss): As reported......................................................................... $ 254,575 $ (35,704) $ (3,396) ---------- ------------ ------------ Compensation expense related to: Stock options accounted for in accordance with APB 25............................ 5,169 4,126 1,640 In-the-money stock options.......................................................

Please refer to Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's accounting for deferred tax assets generated from the exercise of employee stock options.\n\nIn-the-money stock options in the above table have exercise prices below the closing price of our common stock as of the end of each of the respective periods, and out-of-the-money stock options have exercise prices equal to or greater than the closing price of our common stock as of the end of each of the respective periods. The closing prices as of December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 were $27.98, $7.40 and $13.92, respectively.\n\nAs the table above illustrates, total pro forma expense for stock options includes $631,825,000, $1,000,004,000 and $412,860,000 of expense during 2001, 2002 and 2003 related to: (i) the Company's CEO's stock options that were cancelled for no consideration; (ii) stock options forfeited by employees upon termination for no consideration; (iii) stock options that are significantly out of the money (e.g., the weighted-average exercise price of the out-of-the-money stock options was $22.65 per share compared to a closing price of $13.92 per share as of December 31, 2003); and (iv) stock options repurchased for consideration substantially less than is reflected in the table above as a pro forma expense (i.e., the Company repurchased the stock options in 2002 for $54,879,000 versus the $595,297,000 reflected in the above table for 2002 as required by SFAS 123). These items represented 78%, 96% and 92% of the pro forma expense in the above table for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\nThe Company determined the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock options or stock purchase rights as discussed in the remainder of this paragraph. The Company estimated the expected useful lives, giving consideration to the vesting and purchase periods, contractual lives, expected employee turnover, and the relationship between the exercise price and the fair market value of the Company's common stock, among other factors. The expected volatility was estimated giving consideration to the expected useful lives of the stock options, the Company's current expected growth rate, implied expected volatility in traded options for the Company's common stock, and recent volatility of the Company's common stock, among other factors. The risk-free rate is the U.S. Treasury bill rate for the relevant expected life. The fair value of stock options was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\n\nYear Ended December 31, ------------------------------------ 2001 2002 2003 ---------- ------------ ------------ Risk-free interest rate............................................................ 3.83 % 1.99 % 1.78 % Expected life (in years)........................................................... 3.4 3.4 3.1 Expected volatility................................................................ 89 % 65 % 46 %\n\nUsing the Black-Scholes option valuation model, stock options granted during 2001, 2002 and 2003 had weighted average fair values of $16.15, $9.77 and $3.04 per share, respectively. There were no grants in 2001, 2002 or 2003 at exercise prices below market price at the date of grant.\n\nThe fair value of employees' stock purchase rights under the Company's employee stock purchase plans (the \"Purchase Plan\") was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions used for purchases:\n\nYear Ended December 31, ------------------------------------ 2001 2002 2003 ---------- ------------ ------------ Risk-free interest rate............................................................. 4.72 % 1.23 % 1.05 % Expected life (in years)............................................................ 0.5 0.5 0.6 Expected volatility................................................................. 89 % 83 % 47 %\n\nThe weighted average estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights granted under the Purchase Plan during 2001, 2002 and 2003 was $22.60, $7.43 and $2.40 per share, respectively, including the 15% discount from the quoted market price. As discussed further in Note 8, the first offering period for the 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"2003 Purchase Plan\") is from July 1, 2003, to January 31, 2004. Accordingly, the Company has estimated the expected life of the purchase rights granted under the 2003 Purchase Plan during the six months ended December 31, 2003, to be seven months (i.e., 0.6 years).\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nOn January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (\"SFAS 133\"). There was not a cumulative transition adjustment upon adoption. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as cash flow hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that are attributable to a particular risk and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the current period.\n\nThe Company operates internationally and thus is exposed to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates. The Company has entered into foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on receivables, payables and intercompany balances denominated in a non-functional currency. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of currency exchange rate movements on the Company's operating results. These contracts require the Company to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contract's inception. These contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements because the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances and transactions are generally offset with the gains and losses of the foreign exchange contracts. Because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts generally offsets the related impact on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates. The Company does not designate its foreign exchange forward contracts as accounting hedges and, accordingly, the Company adjusts these instruments to fair value through operations (i.e., included in \"other income\"). The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nSubstantially all of the Company's revenues are derived from three primary sources: (i) licensing software, (ii) providing technical support and product updates, otherwise known as maintenance and (iii) providing professional services, including implementation and training services. The Company's standard end user license agreement provides for an initial fee for use of the Company's products in perpetuity based on the number of named users. The Company licenses its software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer typically purchases a combination of: (i) our software products, (ii) a maintenance arrangement, which is generally priced as a percentage of the software license fees and provides for technical support and product updates over a period of one year, and (iii) a professional services arrangement on a time and materials basis.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position No. 97-2 \"Software Revenue Recognition\" (\"SOP 97-2\"), as amended by Statement of Position No. 98-9, \"Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Arrangements.\" Under the residual method, revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when company-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement, but does not exist for one of the delivered elements in the arrangement. The Company allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value, with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately. The Company defers revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements (e.g., professional services and maintenance) and recognizes revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered elements (i.e., software product) when the basic criteria in SOP 97-2 have been met.\n\nThe Company determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the maintenance charged to the customer based on full deployment of the licensed software products and the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement based on the hourly rates that the Company charges for these services when sold independently from a software license. If evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement, the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that these elements are delivered.\n\nUnder SOP 97-2, revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred, provided the fee is fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable and the arrangement does not require significant customization of the software. For substantially all of the Company's software arrangements, these criteria have been met upon delivery of the software to the end customer. Accordingly, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the maintenance and professional services to be provided to the customer and recognizes revenue for the software license upon delivery.\n\nIf at the outset of the customer arrangement, the Company determines that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, the Company defers the revenue and recognizes the revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable. If at the outset of the customer arrangement, the Company determines that collectibility is not probable, the Company defers the revenue and recognizes the revenue when payment is received. The Company recognizes revenue from resellers upon sell-through to the end customer.\n\nThe Company's professional services, maintenance and other revenues relate primarily to maintenance and professionals services. The Company's customers typically prepay maintenance for the first year in connection with new software license and the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the initial maintenance contract. Maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter. Rates for maintenance, including subsequent renewal rates, are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement.\n\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of implementation services related to the installation of the Company's software products and training revenues. The Company's software is ready to use by the customer upon receipt and, therefore, the Company's implementation services do not involve significant customization to or development of the underlying software code. Substantially all of our professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis and, accordingly, are recognized as the services are performed.\n\nRevenues derived from Siebel CRM OnDemand, our hosted CRM solution introduced in the fourth quarter of 2003, are included in \"professional services, maintenance and other revenues.\" The Company accounts for its hosted arrangements in accordance with EITF No. 00-21 \"Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\" (\"EITF 00-21\"). The majority of Siebel CRM OnDemand customers purchase a combination of the Company's hosting service, maintenance and/or professional services. In accordance with EITF 00-21, the Company evaluates whether each of these elements represent a separate unit of accounting, as defined by EITF 00-21, using all applicable facts and circumstances, including: (i) whether the Company sells or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements, (ii) whether the element has standalone value to the customer, (iii) whether there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item, and (iv) whether there is a general right of return.\n\nConcurrent and Nonmonetary Transactions\n\nThe Company's customers include several of its suppliers and on occasion, the Company has purchased goods or services for the Company's operations from these vendors at or about the same time the Company has licensed its software to these same organizations (a \"Concurrent Transaction\"). Software license transactions that occur within six months (i.e., \"at or about the same time\") of a purchase by the Company from that same customer are reviewed by management for appropriate accounting and disclosure. The Company accounts for Concurrent Transactions in accordance with APB No. 29 \"Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions\" and EITF No. 01-02 \"Interpretations of APB Opinion 29,\" collectively referred to as \"APB 29.\" Concurrent Transactions are separately negotiated, settled in cash, and recorded at terms the Company considers to be arm's length. In addition, the Company receives competitive bids for the goods or services purchased by the Company in connection with Concurrent Transactions and these goods or services were budgeted by the Company in advance of the transaction, where appropriate.\n\nPrior to recognizing any revenue from a Concurrent Transaction, the Company ensures that: (i) the transaction meets its standard revenue recognition policies, as discussed above; (ii) the customer meets the Company's standard credit requirements; (iii) the transaction represents the culmination of the earnings process; and (iv) all goods or services purchased by the Company are necessary for its current operations and are expected to be placed into service shortly after purchase. If the Concurrent Transaction meets these requirements, the Company records the revenue at fair value, as defined by APB 29. The Company determines Fair Value based on a comparison of cash transactions for its software that are of similar size and on similar terms as the Concurrent Transaction or the Fair Value of the goods or services purchased by the Company, whichever is more readily determinable. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, the Company recognized $76,400,000 and $50,571,000, respectively, of software license revenues from Concurrent Transactions. The Company did not have any Concurrent Transactions during 2003.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nCost of software consists primarily of amortization of acquired technology, media, product packaging and shipping, documentation and other production costs, and third-party royalties. Cost of professional services, maintenance and other consists primarily of salaries, benefits, and allocated overhead costs related to consulting, training and other global services personnel, including cost of services provided by third-party consultants engaged by the Company.\n\nSoftware Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs associated with new products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established. To date, the time period between the establishment of technological feasibility and completion of software development has been short, and no significant development costs have been incurred during that period. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs to date.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expenses the cost of communicating the advertising in the period in which the advertising is used. Advertising expense is included in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $31,800,000, $16,080,000 and $14,694,000 in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts\n\nThe Company initially records its provision for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts. In estimating the provision for doubtful accounts, management evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet their financial obligations to it, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer, and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and our historical experience.\n\nRestructuring and Related Expenses\n\nIn June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 \"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities\" (\"SFAS 146\"). SFAS 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force (\"EITF\") Issue No. 94-3 \"Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring)\" (\"EITF 94-3\") and EITF Issue No. 88-10 \"Costs Associated with Lease Modification or Termination\" (\"EITF 88-10\"). The Company adopted SFAS 146 effective January 1, 2003; therefore, the restructuring activities initiated in the second quarter of 2003 and completed in the third quarter of 2003 (i.e., the 2003 Restructuring as defined in Note 2) were accounted for in accordance with SFAS 146. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not impact the Company's restructuring obligations recognized in 2002 as these obligations must continue to be accounted for in accordance with EITF 94-3 and EITF 88-10 and other applicable pre-existing guidance.\n\nSFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS 146 also requires that: (i) liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value, (ii) one-time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period; (iii) liabilities related to an operating lease/contract be recorded at fair value and measured when the contract does not have any future economic benefit to the entity (i.e., the entity ceases to utilize the rights conveyed by the contract); and (iv) all other costs related to an exit or disposal activity be expensed as incurred. The Company estimates the fair value of its lease obligations included in the 2003 Restructuring based on the present value of the remaining lease obligation, operating costs, and other associated costs, less estimated sublease income.\n\nThe Company has historically provided substantially the same termination benefits at the time of a non-performance based workforce reduction and, as a result, the Company determined that SFAS 146 did not apply to its employee termination obligations incurred in connection with its 2003 restructuring. The Company has accounted for the employee termination obligations incurred during 2003, with the exception of those created under labor law (e.g., the WARN Act), in accordance with SFAS No. 112 \"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43.\" The Company has accounted for obligations incurred during 2003 under the WARN Act and local labor law in accordance with SFAS No. 88 \"Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.\" Under SFAS 112 and SFAS 88, the Company records these obligations, when the obligations are estimable and probable.\n\nRestructuring obligations incurred prior to the adoption of SFAS 146 (i.e., the 2002 Restructuring, as defined in Note 2) were accounted for and continue to be accounted for in accordance with EITF 94-3 and EITF 88-10. Specifically, the Company accounts for the costs associated with the reduction of its workforce in accordance with EITF 94-3. Accordingly, the Company recorded the liability related to these termination costs when the following conditions were met: (i) management with the appropriate level of authority approves a termination plan that commits the Company to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination; (ii) the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits; (iii) the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their locations and their job classifications; and (iv) the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely. The termination costs recorded by the Company are not associated with nor do they benefit continuing activities.\n\nIn 2002, the Company accounted for costs associated with lease termination and/or abandonment in accordance with EITF 88-10. Accordingly, the Company recorded the costs associated with lease termination and/or abandonment when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to the Company. Under EITF 88-10, the liability associated with lease termination and/or abandonment represents the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs, less probable sublease income. Accordingly, the Company has not reduced the obligations incurred in 2002 to their net present value.\n\nThe Company accounts for costs related to long-lived assets abandoned in accordance with SFAS 144 and, accordingly, charges to expense the net carrying value of the long-lived assets when the Company ceases to use the assets.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, along with net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria, allowances are established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\n\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\n\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares from stock options to purchase common stock, restricted common stock subject to repurchase by the Company, and warrants outstanding, using the treasury stock method.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 \"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities\" (\"FIN 46\"). This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") that either: (1) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. As of December 31, 2003, the Company does not have any entities that require disclosure or consolidation as a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 46.\n\nRestructuring\n\nBackground\n\nBeginning in 2001 and continuing through the first half of 2003, economic conditions in many of the countries in which the Company operates either deteriorated or stabilized at depressed levels. In addition, there appears to have been a disproportionate impact on capital spending, particularly information technology spending, by corporations. As a result, certain of the Company's key operating metrics, such as total revenue, operating margin and revenue per employee, declined from the Company's historical levels. In response to this decline, the Company initiated a series of steps that it believes will: (i) strengthen the Company's competitive position; (ii) reduce its cost structure, thereby improving its revenue per employee, operating margin and overall operating performance; and (iii) better align its management structure in order to return to sequential quarterly revenue growth. Specifically, the Company took the following actions:\n\nThe Company reduced the discretionary portion of its operating costs through various cost control initiatives, including: (i) reducing advertising expenditures; (ii) maintaining the CEO's salary at one dollar per year; (iii) deferring merit increases; (iv) eliminating the majority of bonuses (from July 2001 to June 2002) or realigning bonuses more closely with achievement of financial objectives (commencing in July 2002); (v) reducing depreciation, primarily through reduced capital expenditures; and (vi) reducing other discretionary expenditures, such as costs related to outside consultants, travel and recruiting.\n\nIn order to further align our operating structure with anticipated revenue levels, the Company restructured its operations during the third and fourth quarters of 2002 (the \"2002 Restructuring\"). The 2002 Restructuring consisted primarily of the consolidation of excess facilities, reductions in its workforce and the abandonment of certain assets in connection with the consolidation of excess facilities.\n\nBased on the Company's continued evaluation of economic conditions in the information technology industry and its expectations regarding revenue levels, the Company initiated a further restructuring of its operations in the second quarter of 2003 (the \"2003 Restructuring\" and collectively with the 2002 Restructuring, the \"2002 and 2003 Restructurings\"). The Company completed the 2003 Restructuring in September 2003.\n\nSummary of the 2002 and 2003 Restructurings\n\nThe Company initiated the 2002 Restructuring in July 2002 and completed all activities related to the 2002 Restructuring in December 2002. The 2002 Restructuring was designed to reduce our operating costs in order to better align its operating structure with expected revenue levels. The 2002 Restructuring charge is comprised primarily of: (i) severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of the Company's workforce in 2002; (ii) lease termination costs and other costs associated with permanently vacating certain facilities; and (iii) impairment costs related to certain long-lived assets that were abandoned in connection with the Company's consolidation of its facilities.\n\nDue in part to the continued weakening in the global economy and reduced revenue expectations, the Company initiated the 2003 Restructuring in the second quarter of 2003 in order to continue to lower its cost structure and improve its overall operating performance. Specifically, the 2003 Restructuring included the following key measures: (i) the reduction of its workforce across all functional areas, including reductions related to the consolidation of its management organization and its sales force organization; (ii) the consolidation of additional facilities, including ceasing operations in certain geographic locations; (iii) the abandonment of certain long-lived assets, including leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures; and (iv) the transfer of certain technical support, quality assurance and other product development positions overseas to labor markets with lower cost structures.\n\nIn addition to reducing the Company's cost structure, the Company believes the 2003 Restructuring will result in: (i) a flatter, more responsive and efficient management reporting structure; (ii) a more focused sales organization providing greater responsiveness to customers and faster decision making; and (iii) a continued focus of its resources on key growth areas, such as the Company's newest product offering, Siebel CRM OnDemand, a hosted CRM service designed to meet the growing market demand for fast, easy, and affordable CRM software.\n\nSummary of Restructuring and Related Expenses and the Associated Obligations as of December 31, 2002 and 2003\n\nThe following table summarizes the expenses incurred in connection with the 2002 and 2003 Restructurings and the related obligations as of December 31, 2002 and 2003 (in thousands):\n\nEmployee Facility- Asset Termination Related Abandonment Costs (1) Costs (2) Costs (3) Total ------------- ------------ ------------ ----------- Restructuring obligations, July 1, 2002...................... $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Restructuring and related expenses recognized in 2002 (4).... 23,649 155,701 25,955 205,305 Cash payments................................................

In connection with the 2003 Restructuring, the Company reduced or expects to reduce its workforce by approximately 580 employees, or 10% of its then-current workforce. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had completed approximately 445 of these terminations and expects to complete the reduction of the remaining employees within the next six months. The Company has not completed the separation of employment with these remaining employees primarily due to regulatory requirements in certain countries and its ongoing transition of certain product development positions overseas. The workforce reductions affected substantially all of the Company's organizations and geographical regions. The costs associated with the Company's workforce reductions consist primarily of severance payments, COBRA benefits, payroll taxes and other associated employment termination costs.\n\nAs a result of the workforce reductions and previous employee attrition, certain of the Company's facilities were under-utilized. Accordingly, the Company consolidated its remaining workforce into under-utilized facilities and ceased to utilize the then-vacated facilities. The facilities permanently removed from the Company's operations during both 2002 and 2003 were located primarily in Emeryville and San Mateo, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Europe; and several smaller offices in North America. The costs associated with the Company's facilities consolidation primarily relate to lease termination costs, costs associated with satisfying remaining lease commitments, and expected brokerage and other re-letting costs, partially offset by estimated sublease income.\n\nAs part of the consolidation of the Company's facilities, certain leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures were abandoned. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash charge equal to the net book value of these abandoned assets in Restructuring and related expenses.\n\nIn accordance with EITF 94-3 and EITF 88-10, the Company recorded 2002 Restructuring and related expenses in an amount equal to the gross value of the related obligations without consideration to the net present value of such obligations. In addition, in determining the 2002 Restructuring obligations, the Company assessed the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made.\n\nPrimarily due to the real estate markets in which the Company operates remaining at depressed levels longer than originally anticipated, the Company extended the estimated sublease commencement dates and/or reduced the estimated sublease rates on certain restructured properties. Partially offsetting these reductions in estimated sublease income were favorable changes in estimates that resulted from the Company's: (i) termination of certain leases at more favorable terms than originally anticipated and (ii) entering into subleases sooner than previously expected and/or at higher sublease rates than originally anticipated on certain other restructured properties. The Company believes that its estimates with respect to its remaining obligations related to the 2002 and 2003 Restructurings are appropriate as of December 31, 2003.\n\nIn accordance with SFAS 146, the Company recorded the facility-related expenses incurred in the 2003 Restructuring after giving effect to the net present value of the related obligations.\n\nRepresents the accretion of the 2003 Restructuring obligations. The Company will continue to accrete its obligations related to the 2003 Restructuring to the then present value and, accordingly, will recognize additional accretion expense as a Restructuring and related expense in future periods.\n\nThe following table summarizes the time period in which the Company anticipates settling its remaining Restructuring obligations as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands):\n\nOperating Other Estimated Total Lease Restructuring Sublease Restructuring Year Ending December 31, Obligation (1) Costs (2) Income (3) Obligations - ---------------------------------------------------- -------------- -------------- ----------- ------------- 2004................................................ $ 47,115 $ 16,534 $ (7,567) $ 56,082 2005................................................ 36,140 10,661 (20,218) 26,583 2006................................................ 30,775 9,570 (22,038) 18,307 2007................................................ 26,531 6,106 (19,297) 13,340 2008................................................ 25,685 7,322 (18,086) 14,921 2009 and thereafter................................. 129,889 37,590 (126,217) 41,262 -------------- -------------- ----------- ------------- Total restructuring obligations, gross......... $ 296,135 $ 87,783 $ (213,423) 170,495 ============== ============== =========== Future accretion (4)...........................

The Company's estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending, in part, on factors which may be beyond the Company's control, such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases.\n\nThe Company has reduced the facility-related obligations associated with the 2003 Restructuring to their net present value. Future accretion represents the interest component of these obligations and will be recognized by the Company as an additional Restructuring and related expense and as an increase in the carrying amount of the 2003 Restructuring obligations.\n\nThe total Restructuring charge and related cash outlay are based on management's current estimates, which may change materially if further consolidations are required or if actual lease-related expenditures or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected. The Company will review the status of its Restructuring activities quarterly and, if appropriate, record changes to its Restructuring obligations in current operations based on management's most current estimates.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThe Company did not complete any acquisitions in 2002. The following is a summary of the Company's acquisitions during 2001 and 2003, each of which has been accounted for as a purchase:\n\n2003 Acquisitions\n\nAcquisition of UpShot Corporation\n\nOn November 3, 2003, by way of a merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Siebel Systems with and into UpShot Corporation (\"UpShot\"), Siebel Systems acquired all of the outstanding shares of UpShot, a leading provider of a hosted CRM service, for initial cash consideration of $55,984,000 (the \"Initial Purchase Price\"). The Initial Purchase Price consists of the following: (i) the payment of cash consideration of $50,250,000 for all outstanding securities of UpShot, which includes $250,000 of UpShot shareholders' transaction expenses assumed by the Company; (ii) the payment of $4,508,000 related to an UpShot note payable and related accrued interest assumed in the acquisition; (iii) transaction costs of $2,140,000, consisting primarily of professional fees incurred related to investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and valuation advisors; and (iv) a reduction in the purchase price of $914,000 for proceeds from the exercise of stock options by UpShot employees on the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had paid $55,440,000 of the Initial Purchase Price and expects to pay the remaining $544,000 in early 2004.\n\nThe Company expects the acquisition of UpShot to accelerate its penetration of the hosted CRM market and expand customer choice in this market. Further, the Company believes the acquisition of UpShot will allow it to capitalize on the expertise of the UpShot management team in the hosted CRM market and their ability to develop new products using the Company's existing technology.\n\nIn accordance with the purchase method of accounting prescribed by SFAS 141, the Company allocated the Initial Purchase Price of $55,984,000 to the tangible net assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. Under the purchase method of accounting, the Initial Purchase Price does not include the contingent earnout amounts described below. The Initial Purchase Price has been allocated as follows (in thousands):\n\nTangible assets: Cash and cash equivalents........................ $ 578 Accounts receivable and other current assets..... 2,094 Property and equipment........................... 260 Other assets-long term........................... 267 -------------- Total tangible assets....................... 3,199 -------------- Intangible assets: Customer relationships........................... 6,700 Acquired technology.............................. 1,200 Goodwill......................................... 58,387 -------------- Total intangible assets..................... 66,287 -------------- Liabilities assumed: Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities... (9,707) Deferred revenue................................. (3,769) Other liabilities-long term...................... (26) -------------- Total liabilities assumed................... (13,502) -------------- Net assets acquired......................... $ 55,984 ==============\n\nBased in part on the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, the Company allocated $6,700,000 of the purchase price to a \"customer relationship\" intangible asset and $1,200,000 of the purchase price to an \"acquired technology\" intangible asset. The acquired technology intangible asset is currently being amortized over a period of fourteen months using the straight-line method and the customer relationship intangible asset is being amortized over a period of six years based on the estimated customer attrition rates, currently estimated at approximately 30% per year of the remaining acquired customers.\n\nThe fair values of the customer relationship and acquired technology intangible assets were determined using the \"income\" and \"relief from royalty\" valuation approaches, respectively. The Company utilized a 20% discount rate to determine the present values of the estimated net cash flows of each of these assets. The discount rate selected was based in part on the Company's weighted average cost of capital and determined after consideration of the Company's rate of return on debt capital and equity, the weighted average return on invested capital and the risk associated with achieving forecasted cash flows. In performing this purchase price allocation, the Company considered, among other factors, its intention for future use of the acquired assets, analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of UpShot's technology.\n\nThe excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired of $58,387,000 was assigned to goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. This amount is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The operating results of UpShot have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\n\nAs a result of UpShot meeting certain revenue and revenue related targets, as defined in the merger agreement, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company paid the former holders of UpShot common stock additional consideration of $192,000, which the Company recorded as goodwill as of December 31, 2003. In the event certain revenue, revenue-related and product delivery targets defined in the merger agreement are met during 2004, the Company could be required to pay up to an additional $9,750,000 to the former holders of UpShot common stock and an additional $9,750,000 to the former employees of UpShot who are current employees of the Company at the time of payment. All amounts paid by the Company to the UpShot shareholders will be recorded as an increase to goodwill and amounts paid to the former employees of UpShot will be recorded as compensation expense when earned.\n\nThe following table presents unaudited summarized combined results of operations of the Company and UpShot, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of January 1, 2002. The following amounts are in thousands, except per share amounts.\n\nDecember 31, ------------------------------ 2002 2003 -------------- -------------- Total revenues...................................... $ 1,639,836 $ 1,359,145 Net loss............................................ $ (47,231) $ (12,220) Basic and diluted net loss per share................ $ (0.10) $ (0.02)\n\nThe above unaudited pro forma summarized results of operations are intended for informational purposes only and, in the opinion of management, are neither indicative of the financial position or results of operations of the Company had the acquisition actually taken place as of January 1, 2002, nor indicative of the Company's future results of operations. In addition, the above unaudited pro forma summarized results of operations do not include potential cost savings from operating efficiencies or synergies that may result from the Company's acquisition of UpShot.\n\nAcquisition of Certain Assets of Motiva, Inc.\n\nOn October 13, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets (primarily intellectual property) of Motiva, Inc. (\"Motiva\"), a provider of enterprise incentive management (\"EIM\") software, for total consideration of $2,921,000 ($2,300,000 cash purchase price plus $100,000 of acquisition related costs and $521,000 of liabilities assumed or incurred in connection with this acquisition). The Company expects the acquisition of these assets to accelerate the Company's penetration of the EIM market and expand customer choice in this market. Further, the Company believes that Motiva's technology and the next generation of its technology (under development by Motiva at the time of acquisition) will enhance the Company's current offerings in the EIM market. Specifically, the Company believes the incorporation of Motiva's services-processing architecture will enable users of Siebel Incentive Compensation to handle a much broader variety of compensation plans with greater flexibility and increased performance. The Company is targeting availability for an enhanced integrated offering utilizing portions of the existing and under development Motiva technology in the second half of 2004.\n\nSubstantially all of the assets acquired from Motiva related to various forms of intellectual property (i.e., existing technology and technology under development). The technology under development was approximately 25% complete at the date of acquisition and the Company expects to incur up to an additional $2,000,000 to complete this development, with completion expected by the second half of 2004. Based on the Company's evaluation of the assets acquired, the Company allocated the purchase price to two identifiable intangible assets: \"acquired technology\" of approximately $900,000 and in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") of approximately $1,513,000.\n\nThe Company determined the fair value of the assets acquired based on the anticipated net cash flows of each asset, discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate of approximately 20% for the acquired technology and 30% for the IPR&D. The Company is amortizing the acquired technology over its estimated useful life of three years using the straight-line method and included the IPR&D portion in \"purchased in-process product development\" in the accompanying statement of operations. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired of $159,000 was recorded as goodwill. This amount is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe Company has included the operating results of Motiva in its consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information giving effect to this acquisition has not been presented because the pro forma information would not differ materially from the historical results of the Company.\n\nAcquisition of Certain Analytics Technology\n\nIn order to further expand the Company's entrance into the analytics market, the Company entered into a worldwide, royalty-free perpetual license to certain technologies (including object code, source code, and documentation) and intellectual property rights (including copyrights, patent rights, and trade secret rights) owned by a third-party provider of analytic software solutions. The license fee for this technology was $3,450,000. The Company expects to continue the development of this technology, which it believes will result in a further expansion of our analytics' suite, with the completion of the first products using this technology expected in the second half of 2004. Because the technology obtained in this license had no alternative future uses, the Company has reflected the license fee of $3,450,000 in purchased in-process product development expense during 2003. The Company expects to incur an additional $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 of costs to further develop this technology and integrate it with the Company's existing analytics technologies, which the Company believes will result in a new and enhanced suite of analytics products.\n\nAcquisition of Certain Assets of BoldFish, Inc.\n\nIn March 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of BoldFish, Inc. (\"BoldFish\"), a developer of permission-based outbound messaging solutions, for an initial payment of $1,000,000. The purchase price was allocated to tangible net assets totaling $136,000 (current assets of $92,000 and property and equipment of $44,000) and identifiable intangible assets (acquired technology) valued at $376,000. The acquired technology is currently being amortized over its estimated useful life of three years using the straight-line method. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired of $488,000 was recorded as goodwill. This amount is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. As a result of BoldFish meeting certain product delivery targets, as defined in the merger agreement, during 2003, the Company paid an additional $270,000 of purchase consideration to BoldFish, which the Company recorded as goodwill.\n\nThe Company has included the operating results of BoldFish in its consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information giving effect to this acquisition has not been presented because the pro forma information would not differ materially from the historical results of the Company.\n\n2001 Acquisitions\n\nThe following acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of the acquired companies have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information giving effect to these acquisitions has not been presented since the pro forma information would not differ materially from the historical results of the Company.\n\nnQuire Software, Inc.\n\nOn November 19, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding securities of nQuire Software, Inc. (\"nQuire\"), a provider of Internet-based business analytics software. The Company acquired nQuire in order to capitalize on the expertise of the nQuire management team in the analytics market and their ability to develop new products using the Company's existing technology and technology acquired in the acquisition.\n\nThe Company acquired nQuire for consideration of $59,722,000, consisting of 2,259,810 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $58,416,000 and the issuance of stock options to existing employees of nQuire to purchase 56,108 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $1,306,000. The Company valued the stock options issued to the employees of nQuire based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, using a risk-free interest rate of 5.0%, the expected remaining life of the option and a volatility factor of 90.0%. The purchase price was allocated to tangible net assets, including net deferred tax assets of $5,318,000, other current assets of $1,258,000, property and equipment of $105,000, assumed current liabilities of $2,872,000 and deferred compensation related to unvested stock options and restricted common stock of $1,397,000. Based in part on an independent valuation study of nQuire, the Company determined that there was no purchased IPR&D and that the only identifiable intangible asset not subsumed into goodwill (i.e., assembled workforce) was \"acquired technology\" valued at $7,500,000. The acquired technology is being amortized over its useful life of three years using the straight-line method. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired of $47,016,000 was recorded as goodwill. This amount is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nAs a result of nQuire meeting certain revenue and product delivery targets during 2001 and 2002, as defined in the merger agreement, the Company issued an additional 262,000 shares valued at $6,231,000 during 2002 and 207,000 shares valued at $1,670,000 during 2003. The Company reflected $7,612,000 of this additional consideration as goodwill and $289,000 as compensation expense during 2002.\n\nSales.com, Inc.\n\nOn January 12, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding securities of Sales.com, Inc. (\"Sales.com\") for total consideration of $28,235,000, consisting of the issuance of 373,618 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $26,900,000 and the issuance of stock options to purchase 49,895 shares of its common stock to existing employees of Sales.com valued at $1,335,000. The Company valued the stock options issued to the employees of Sales.com based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, using a risk-free interest rate of 5.0%, the expected remaining life of the option and a volatility factor of 77.0%. The purchase price was allocated to tangible net assets, including cash of $11,550,000, other current assets of $1,178,000, property and equipment of $385,000 and assumed current liabilities of $888,000. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of $16,010,000 was allocated to acquired technology, which the Company assigned a three-year estimated life and amortized using the straight-line method.\n\nIn connection with the 2003 Restructuring, the Company performed an evaluation of its product lines and existing development efforts to determine if any products and/or development efforts should be discontinued. As a result of this evaluation, in July 2003 the Company determined that it would no longer utilize the technology acquired through the acquisition of Sales.com (i.e., certain product modules and the remaining Sales.com source code). In reaching this conclusion, the Company considered the following: (i) the Company's recently developed modules and functionality utilizing the J2EE platform was superior to the technology acquired from Sales.com, and (ii) the Company's product development resources would be more effectively utilized on other projects, particularly given the workforce reduction that occurred in the 2003 Restructuring. Accordingly, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Sales.com acquired technology was no longer recoverable and therefore wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of $2,449,000 during the third quarter of 2003. The Company has reflected this charge of $2,449,000 in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for 2003, under the caption \"cost of software revenues.\"\n\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nGoodwill\n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during 2002 and 2003 were as follows (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31, ------------------------ 2002 2003 ----------- ----------- Balance as of beginning of the year........................... $ 72,869 $ 80,949 Earnout payments to the stockholders of acquired companies......................................... 8,112 962 Goodwill obtained in acquisitions of businesses............... -- 59,034 Foreign currency fluctuation..................................

This asset had a net carrying value of $2,449,000 (cost of $16,010,000 less accumulated amortization of $13,561,000) at the time of abandonment in July 2003. In addition, the Company wrote-off a fully amortized acquired intangible asset with a cost and accumulated value of $3,236,000 in November 2003.\n\nBased on identified intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2003, and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, amortization expense is expected to be as follows (in thousands):\n\nYear Ending December 31, - ------------------------------- 2004.......................................................... $ 5,691 2005.......................................................... 1,776 2006.......................................................... 1,204 2007.......................................................... 747 2008.......................................................... 746 2009 and thereafter........................................... 622 ----------- Total.................................................... $ 10,786 ===========\n\nFinancial Statement Details\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities\n\nCash equivalents consist of securities with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.

In addition, each of the securities have investment grade ratings and are in an unrealized loss position due solely to interest rate changes, sector credit rating changes, or company-specific rating changes. In addition, the Company expects to receive the full principal and interest due on these securities and has the ability to hold these securities to maturity. Accordingly, we do not believe that these securities are impaired as of December 31, 2003 and therefore have not recognized an \"other-than-temporary\" impairment on these investments.\n\nShort-term investments as of December 31, 2002, consisted of $385,195,000 of securities that mature in less than one year, $1,108,898,000 of securities that mature in one to five years and no securities that mature in over five years.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2003, the Company has reflected the carrying value of these cost-method investments of $10,538,000 and $7,714,000, respectively, in other long-term assets. During 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Company wrote down certain of these cost-method investments as the decline in these investments was deemed to be other-than-temporary (i.e., write-down of cost-method investments in the table above). As of December 31, 2003, the fair value of the Company's cost-method investments approximates their carrying value.\n\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of its short-term investments, marketable equity securities, and investments accounted for under the cost method at the end of each reporting period to determine if any investments are impaired. This review includes an evaluation of historical and projected financial performance of the issuer, expected cash needs and recent funding events at the issuer. Other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in earnings if: (i) the market value of the investment is below its current carrying value for an extended period, which the Company generally defines as six to nine months; (ii) the issuer has experienced significant financial declines; or (iii) the issuer has experienced difficulties in raising capital to continue operations, among other factors.\n\nConvertible Subordinated Debentures\n\nIn September 1999, the Company issued $300,000,000 of convertible subordinated debentures (the \"Debentures\") and in connection therewith incurred $8,684,000 of issuance costs (the \"Issuance Costs\"). On September 30, 2003, the Company redeemed all of the Debentures in accordance with their terms for $307,080,000, plus accrued interest of $688,000. In connection with this redemption, the Company incurred a pre-tax charge to operations of $10,711,000, consisting of a $7,080,000 redemption premium and the write-off of the remaining unamortized Issuance Costs of $3,631,000. The Company has reflected the $10,711,000 loss on the early extinguishment of the debt in \"Other income, net\" during 2003.\n\nPrior to redemption, the Debentures bore interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum, had a maturity date of September 15, 2006, and were convertible at the option of the holder into an aggregate of 12,867,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $23.32 per share.\n\nCommitments and Contingencies\n\nLetters of Credit\n\nAs of December 31, 2003, the Company had secured letters of credit with banks totaling approximately $18,898,000. These letters of credit, which expire between June 2004 and November 2015, collateralize certain of the Company's lease obligations to various third parties.\n\nLegal Actions\n\nOn August 22, 2003, the Company and its Board of Directors settled a derivative suit filed by Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana (\"TRSL\"), a Louisiana public trust fund. The Company firmly believed that TRSL's claims were without merit, but settled the case to avoid the costs and management time involved in litigation. The settlement was approved by the court on October 14, 2003. The derivative suit alleged, among other things, that members of the Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by authorizing excessive executive compensation. The derivative plaintiffs sought compensatory and other damages, rescission of certain stock options and other relief. As part of the settlement, the Company agreed: (i) to implement certain enhancements to its corporate governance policies and (ii) not to oppose the application to the court by TRSL's attorneys for reimbursement of their legal fees in connection with the lawsuit, not to exceed $900,000, which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2003.\n\nOn May 6, 2003, the Enforcement Division staff (\"Staff\") of the Securities & Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") contacted the Company and indicated that a May 1, 2003 article on CBS MarketWatch had raised questions regarding the Company's compliance with Regulation FD. In August 2003, the SEC Staff notified the Company and two of its officers of the SEC Staff's preliminary decision to recommend that the SEC take enforcement action against the Company and these officers in regard to statements allegedly made prior to and during an April 30, 2003 dinner. No such enforcement action has been initiated, and no findings have been issued. The Company and its officers have filed submissions with the SEC in response to the SEC notices and the Company believes that these submissions contain numerous meritorious defenses to these allegations. As the Company disclosed during its earnings call on January 21, 2004, it appears that this matter may soon go before the SEC for a decision. If the SEC decides to pursue this matter, the Company expects that it will continue though its normal course of civil action.\n\nIn addition, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of any pending legal matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, although results of operations or cash flows could be affected in a particular period.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe Company sells software licenses and services to its customers under contracts which the Company refers to as Software License and Service Agreements (each an \"SLSA\"). Each SLSA contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer, and generally includes certain provisions for indemnifying the customer against losses, expenses, and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event the Company's software is found to infringe upon a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. The SLSA generally limits the scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry-standard respects, including but not limited to certain time- and geography-based scope limitations and a right to replace an infringing product.\n\nThe Company believes its internal development processes and other policies and practices limit its exposure related to the indemnification provisions of the SLSA. In addition, the Company requires its employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions agreement, which assigns the rights to its employees' development work to the Company. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse any of its customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no material claims are outstanding as of December 31, 2003. For s"
