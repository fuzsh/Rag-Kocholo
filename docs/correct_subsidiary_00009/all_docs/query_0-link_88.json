        "text": "Crowley’s Commitment to Sustainability\n\nTo reach this target, Crowley estimates that it will reduce overall emissions by 4.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, or the equivalent of removing more than 900,000 cars from the road every year.\n\n“Crowley is on a mission to become the most sustainable and innovative maritime, logistics company in the Americas,” said Tom Crowley, chairman and CEO. “Working together with our customers, suppliers, policymakers and others across our value chain, we can meet the climate crisis head on.”\n\nAs it lays the groundwork for a clean energy future, Crowley is creating partnerships across the industry with government and non-governmental organizations to collaboratively achieve decarbonization and climate action.\n\nCrowley Will Build and Operate the First Fully Electric U.S. Tugboat\n\nThe future of sustainable tugboats advances with the eWolf, the first all-electric tugboat in the U.S. to serve the ship assist industry. The zero-emissions tug continues Crowley’s dedication to sustainability and decarbonization in maritime logistics.\n\nDesigned by Crowley Engineering Service, the tugboat will serve the Port of San Diego in partnership with federal and state agencies. The eWolf – named in homage to Crowley’s first tug, the Sea Wolf – embodies our pioneering role in the U.S. tugboat service as we embrace our responsibility to protect the environment with our partners in federal, state and local government."
