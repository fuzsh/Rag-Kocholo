        "text": "NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Software companies Siebel Systems Inc. and Scopus Technology Inc. announced a merger Monday valued at $460 million.\n\nSiebel of San Mateo, Calif., markets software that helps companies manage customer, product and competitive information. Emeryville, Calif.-based Scopus makes software that helps companies automate customer support and sales and marketing activities.\n\nShares of Siebel (SEBL) were off 5-7/16 to 56-1/6 in early afternoon trading while shares of Scopus were up 4-11/16 to 18-13/16.\n\nEach outstanding Scopus common share will be exchanged for .36405 of a newly issued Siebel common share. All outstanding Scopus employee options will be converted into Siebel options at the same ratio. The deal will be accounted for as a pooling of interests and is expected to close in the second quarter.\n\nThe combined company will be known as Siebel Systems and will be headquartered in San Mateo. Scopus will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Siebel focusing on customer service, field service and call center products.\n\nTogether, they reported revenue of $206.4 million in 1997. Between them, they have more than 900 employees and 500 customers worldwide.\n\n\"We are combining the leader in sales and marketing automation with the leader in customer service and call center solutions to provide customers the unified enterprise relationship management systems they are clearly telling us they want,\" said Thomas M. Siebel, chairman and chief executive officer of Siebel Systems.\n\nOri D. Sasson, chairman and chief executive of Scopus, said the deal will benefit customers of both companies.\n\n\"We can now dramatically expand the scope of solutions and level of service that we can provide our installed base,\" he said."
