        "text": "The company is installing the Siebel e-business applications software Siebel Finance along with IBM WebSphere middleware and IBM eServer pSeries systems. IBM's Business Consulting Services unit is leading the implementation.\n\nSiebel says its Finance product will replace two internally developed systems and will ultimately support staff in UMB's 153 banking centres as well as employees at the bank's investment services, trust management, brokerage services, consulting services and insurance divisions.\n\nThe system is designed for for retail banks and securities firms that includes customer management, account opening, service management, transaction processing and analytics.\n\nSiebel says its Finance software, running on the IBM platform, will allow UMB to create a single, personalised view of its customers across all channels, including local branches and online banking Web sites. The project will streamline the bank's business processes and identify areas for improvement.\n\nCommenting on the implementation, Jim Matteoni, chief technology Officer, UMB Financial Corporation, says: \"We'll be able to centralise customer information and share it across all of our businesses instead of maintaining it separately in each business unit.\n\n\"This will improve communication with our customers, enhance the quality of customer service, increase sales productivity, and create new cross-sell opportunities.\"\n\nThe system will be implemented in phases, with the initial phase slated for the first quarter of 2005."
