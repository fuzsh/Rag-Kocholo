        "text": "In today’s episode, billionaire entrepreneur Tom Siebel shares some thought-provoking insights on new, leading technologies and its impact on businesses and society. He is the founder of C3.ai, a new software platform that harnesses big data, IoT and AI.\n\nTom covers in this episode the contents of his book, Digital Transformation, as well as some intriguing ideas about huge US Tech companies.\n\nSilicon Valley Entrepreneurial Giant\n\nListeners might recall Bruce Cleveland, author of The Traction Gap and guest in episode 033. He used to work with Tom Siebel at Siebel Systems, which was the category king in the 1st wave of CRM.\n\nIn the year 1999, Fortune magazine named Siebel Systems “the fastest growing company in the United States.” In 2006, they merged with Oracle for $5.85 billion.\n\nDigital Transformation\n\nTom has a brand new book entitled Digital Transformation. The book covers giant megatrends and impacts on business and society. CEOs and senior leaders would find this book highly beneficial to their decision-making process.\n\n“The coming two decades will bring more information technology innovation than the past half-century.”\n\n–Tom Siebel, Digital Transformation\n\nFurther, he discussed that companies who fail to seize this massive technological growth will be extinct in the future. In the last 30 years, companies that didn’t make the necessary transition required in their industry, cease to exist today.\n\nContinuous Learning and Education\n\nTom Siebel and his company have a real commitment to their employees: to focus on continuous learning and education. Employees can take online classes via Coursera—in relation to AI, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, among others. Universities such as Stanford, MIT, and the University of Illinois offers these online courses.\n\n“Things are changing more rapidly so to be on top of these, you must be continuously learning”\n\n–Tom Siebel\n\nThe company recognizes the employees who completed the courses and awards cash bonuses — ranging from $1500 to $25,000. At the moment, the company is rolling out new incentives — a 15% increase in compensation and an additional equity grant.\n\n“These people are better equipped to do their jobs and to serve customers. This is to advance their careers professionally. They also do feel more empowered, so everybody wins.”\n\n–Tom Siebel"
