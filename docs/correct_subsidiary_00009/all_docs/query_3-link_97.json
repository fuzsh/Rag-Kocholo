For those looking for training that will take them from little-to-no knowledge of draught to complete understanding of the technology, the five-day Draught Master course will build your knowledge through extensive and in-depth content.\n\nThe first two days of the course offers novice-level draught training, providing the skills needed to understand draught dynamics from keg to glass. The following three days build over that draught knowledge to give students the skills and confidence required to address more demanding draught-related challenges.\n\nThe Draught Master course blends theoretical fundamentals of dispense with “hands-on” practical application using a wide range of brand kegs. Simple mechanics, physics, fluid dynamics, chemistry, microbiology, draught beer math and basic customer skills form the core of the curriculum along with content addressing refrigeration, service of non-beer beverages and much, much more.\n\nAbout the Course Instructor Martin Schuster\n\nOne of the nation’s leading draught technology specialists, Martin Schuster has trained thousands of students from hundreds of companies worldwide including the world’s leading breweries.
