Siebel and Scopus shareholders have approved the deal and Siebel claims the integration of products, product architecture and global operations has been successfully concluded, issues that had caused reason for concern a little while ago (CI No 3,370). The new company is known as Siebel Systems and is to operate out of headquarters in San Mateo, California. The company’s chairman and chief executive, Thomas Siebel said: The integration of the two companies is complete – plain and simple. We are open for business."
