        "text": "Description of Transaction\n\n1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the \"Surviving Corporation\").\n\n1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\").\n\n1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the \"Closing\") shall take place at the offices of Xxxxxx Godward LLP, 0000 Xxxxxxx Xxxxxx, Xxxx Xxxx, Xxxxxxxxxx 00000 at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by Parent, which shall be no later than the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such time and date as the parties may designate. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the \"Closing Date.\" Contemporaneously with or as promptly as practicable after the Closing, a properly executed certificate of merger conforming to the requirements of the DGCL shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time such certificate of merger is filed with and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the \"Effective Time\").\n\n1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:\n\nthe certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time in a form acceptable to Parent;\n\nthe bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and\n\nthe directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the individuals identified on Exhibit C.\n\n1.5 Conversion of Shares.\n\nSubject to Sections 1.8(c) and 1.9, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:\n\neach share of the common stock (par value $0.001 per share) of the Company (the \"Company Common Stock\") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the \"Applicable Fraction\" (as defined in Section 1.5(b)) of a share of the common stock (par value $0.01 per share) of Parent (\"Parent Common Stock\");\n\neach share of the common stock (par value $0.001 per share) of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; and\n\nall calculations under this Section 1.5(a) shall be rounded to the nearest one millionth (1/1,000,000th).\n\nFor purposes of this Agreement, the \"Applicable Fraction\" shall be the fraction having: (A) a numerator equal to 3,706,564 and (B) a denominator equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any such shares that are subject to a repurchase option or risk of forfeiture under any restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement), plus (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock purchasable under or otherwise subject to all Company options, warrants or other rights to purchase Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all shares of Company Common Stock that may ultimately be purchased under Company Options (as defined in Section 1.6 below), warrants or other rights to purchase Company Common Stock that are unvested or are otherwise not then exercisable). Subject only to Section 1.5(c), in no case shall the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued under Section 1.5(a), when added to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the holders of options, warrants and convertible debentures to purchase Company Common Stock under Section 1.6, exceed 3,706,564 shares.\n\nIn the event Parent at any time or from time to time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time declares or pays any dividend on Parent Common Stock payable in Parent Common Stock or in any right to acquire Parent Common Stock, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Parent Common Stock (by stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like), or in the event the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Parent Common Stock, then the Applicable Fraction shall be appropriately adjusted.\n\nIf any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and/or subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.\n\nA portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be delivered into escrow and held as specified in Section 1.8 hereof.\n\n1.6 Employee Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each stock option that is then outstanding under the Company's 1998 Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested (a \"Company Option\"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Company's 1998 Stock Plan and the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced and the Company's repurchase right with respect to any unvested shares acquired by the exercise of Company Options shall be assigned to Parent. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under outstanding Company Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, (a) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (b) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable Fraction, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (c) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Applicable Fraction, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent, and (d) each assumed Company Option designated an \"incentive stock option\" as defined in Section 422 of the Code (\"ISO\") immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an ISO; and (e) all restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall continue in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that each such assumed Company Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction effected by Parent after the Effective Time. The Company and Parent shall take all action that may be necessary (under the Company's 1998 Stock Plan and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6. Each holder of a Company Option will receive credit for time served as an employee of the Company for the purposes of the vesting schedule of such Company Option assumed by the Parent. Following the Closing, Parent will send to each holder of an assumed Company Option a written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Option, and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 60 days after the Closing Date, unless such 60 day period is impracticable, Parent shall file with the SEC, a registration statement on Form S-8 registering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.6.\n\n1.7 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of the Company's capital stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of the Company's capital stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of such shares of the Company's capital stock (a \"Company Stock Certificate\") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8.\n\n1.8 Exchange of Certificates; Escrow Shares.\n\n(i) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the \"Exchange Agent\"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (1) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1, and (2) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the \"Exchange Fund.\"\n\n(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to the Merger Stockholders (x) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the Merger Stockholder holding such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing 90% of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such Merger Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock), and (2) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall thereupon also deliver to the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement in the form of Exhibit H hereto (the \"Escrow Agreement\") a certificate representing 10% of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such Merger Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by Section 1. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.\n\nNo dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends and distributions and such cash payment).\n\nNo fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of capital stock of the Company who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder's Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing (the \"Average Parent Common Stock Price\").\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Company Stock Certificate to any Person who may be an \"affiliate\" (as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company until such Person shall have delivered to Parent and the Company a duly executed Affiliate Agreement as contemplated by Section 5.9.\n\nAny portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.\n\nEach of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.\n\nNeither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.\n\n1.9 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any shares (\"Dissenting Shares\") of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that either (a) are or may become \"dissenting shares\" within the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the CGCL or (b) held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (\"Section 262\") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5 (or cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5), but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to either (x) payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 or (y) such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Chapter 13 of the CGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares under Section 262 or Chapter 13 of the CGCL, as applicable, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.8(c)). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of any demands received by the Company for payment of fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock (including a copy of each demand), and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in and direct, at Parent's expense, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or agree to do any of the foregoing. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall be responsible for all payments with respect to Dissenting Shares, including without limitation, all expense associated with negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal required under DGCL or the CGCL.\n\n1.10 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a \"plan of reorganization\" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.\n\n1.11 Accounting Treatment. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to be treated as a \"pooling of interests.\"\n\n1.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.\n\nRepresentations and Warranties of the Company\n\nThe Company represents and warrants, except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, to and for the benefit of the Indemnitees, as follows:\n\n2.1 Due Organization; Subsidiaries; Etc.\n\nEach of the Acquired Corporations (as defined below) has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has full power (corporate and other) and authority: (i) to conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted; (ii) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and used; and (iii) to perform its obligations under all material Contracts by which it is bound.\n\nEach of the Acquired Corporations has not conducted any business under or otherwise used, for any purpose or in any jurisdiction, any fictitious name, assumed name, trade name or other name.\n\nEach of the Acquired Corporations is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, under the laws of all jurisdictions where the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business requires such qualification and where the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on such Acquired Corporation.
