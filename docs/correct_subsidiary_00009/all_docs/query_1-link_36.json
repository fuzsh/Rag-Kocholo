BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nLivePerson, Inc., a customer relationship management (CRM) application service provider (ASP), delivers real-time sales, marketing and customer service solutions for companies that conduct business online. Over 3,000 businesses currently employ LivePerson's suite of products and services. We believe our products and services help our customers increase revenue and productivity, answer customer questions and build customer relationships.\n\nLivePerson's products and services enable sales and customer service teams to interact with their customers online in a cost-effective and secure real-time environment. Through the use of the LivePerson application, companies can engage online customers at critical points in the buying process. We believe the ability to communicate with the right customer at the right time helps to increase revenue by increasing online sales conversion rates, improve the efficiency of sales and customer service operators and decrease overall customer support costs.\n\nHistorically, online businesses have had limited ways to communicate with their customers and respond to inquiries about matters such as product features, transaction security and shipping details. Although companies offer telephone numbers, email and self-service tools for customer assistance, these options are often ineffective and frustrating as consumers endure long wait times or receive insufficient information. Companies understand that if they do not address these issues in a timely matter, they risk losing customers to competitors and increasing their customer interaction costs.\n\nWith LivePerson's real-time chat applications, a company's customer service and sales agents are able to respond to customer inquiries more quickly and efficiently than with other service options. By using features such as preformatted responses, repeat visitor alerts, proactive engagement tools and chat transcripts, companies can offer online shoppers a more enhanced and satisfactory customer experience. Based on feedback from our customers, we believe that businesses that use LivePerson's products and services begin to see an immediate return on their investment as customers who complete\n\n2\n\na chat with a sales or customer service representative frequently purchase more than those who do not. Companies also realize lower customer support costs as operators can handle up to four incoming customer inquiries at one time. Combining the interactive nature of the Internet with the dependability of traditional customer service, LivePerson's applications help companies build strong, long-lasting consumer relationships, convert browsers into buyers and turn one-time visitors into loyal customers.\n\nThe LivePerson suite of products and services includes Service Edition, LivePerson's click-to-chat application; Sales Edition, a proactive online sales application; LivePerson Pro for small businesses; and MultiCARE, a document management, email and frequently asked question (\"FAQ\") service. LivePerson offers these solutions as outsourced services that eliminate the large hardware and software investment typically associated with one-to-one customer interaction solutions. Because the LivePerson application is hosted on servers that are managed by LivePerson, our clients benefit from limited software requirements, no hardware installations and minimum effort for upgrades. Clients may also add additional services upon request.\n\nLivePerson currently has more than 3,000 clients, including key players in the software, financial services, retail and telecom sectors. The 2002 client list includes customers such as Ameritrade, Bell Canada, Bell South, Computer Associates, EarthLink, eBay, Microsoft, Neiman Marcus, QVC and VeriSign.\n\nLivePerson was incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 1995 and the initial LivePerson service was introduced in November 1998.\n\nIndustry Background\n\nOnline Shopping\n\nThe Internet has become an important sales channel for companies that conduct business online. According to a Jupitermedia Market Forecast Report published in January 2002, online spending will reach a projected $52 billion in 2003, a 28% increase over 2002, and online spending is projected to reach $105 billion by 2007. More significantly, the Internet is expected to influence one-third of all U.S. retail spending by 2007.\n\nTo effectively compete in this environment, online businesses increasingly strive to provide high quality customer service and interactive sales capabilities to attract and retain customers. Companies must focus on their customers to prevent the loss of revenue and market share to their competitors. In July 2002, Gartner predicted that through 2007 over 75% of organizations would continue to fail to fully meet customer expectations for customer service excellence, resulting in an average turnover of 100 percent of the customer base every five years.\n\nTo address this concern, companies are beginning to implement new methods of conducting sales and customer service online. Their focus has turned to real-time communication channels to help them answer customer inquiries more efficiently and effectively and to connect with a customer before they turn to their competitors for additional information.\n\nThe CRM Market\n\nRecently, the CRM application software market has realized significant shifts in the way companies purchase products and services. Despite a downturn in the economy, companies continue to spend on CRM applications as they realize the value that these tools can bring to their enterprise. Some of the recent changes that the industry has seen include:\n\n\n\nCompanies with highly scrutinized budgets are looking for smaller, value-added deals in place of multi-million dollar deals that were common in the past.\n\n\n\nProof of rapid return on investment is critical.\n\n3\n\n\n\nBusinesses value flexibility, and therefore may pay more for a shorter term commitment.\n\n\n\nCompanies are shifting towards real-time applications as these will result in cash savings and increases in customer satisfaction.\n\nThe LivePerson Solution\n\nLivePerson is a provider of technology that facilitates real-time sales and customer service for companies doing business on the Internet. As an application service provider (ASP), LivePerson offers this technology as an outsourced service to companies of all sizes. The LivePerson suite of products and services enables our clients to interact with their customers in real time through live text-based chat or to provide answers to routine customer inquiries through a searchable knowledge base of FAQs. LivePerson's services also enable site monitoring and proactive interaction capabilities that create an online experience very much like a traditional offline sales or service environment, by enabling clients to welcome Web site visitors, share marketing or promotional information with them, and engage them in an online, text-based conversation, all within the feature set of the LivePerson solution.\n\nTo implement our text-based chat, email and FAQ services, our clients simply place a LivePerson-branded or custom-created icon on one or more pages of their Web sites and give their operators access to our service via the Internet. When an Internet user browsing a client's Web site desires live text-based assistance, the user simply clicks on the icon. This causes a pop-up dialogue window to appear on the user's screen. The Internet user and our client's operator then engage in a real-time online conversation in this dialogue window. The operator may incorporate graphics and links to Web pages into the dialogue window. Our service enables this live conversation by linking the Internet user and our clients' operators through our proprietary technology, which resides on our servers. Our clients may also have their customer service operators proactively engage in chat conversations with their customers, or provide customized marketing or promotional information directly to those customers.\n\nWe create and store conversation transcripts and related data, and we also enable our clients to generate optional Internet user exit surveys, which our clients can use to collect additional information about Internet users. Stored data includes the Internet user's name, browser type, Internet Protocol (IP) address, responses to exit surveys, the operator's identity and time stamps for each chat transmission. In addition, we provide our clients with tools to analyze the stored information. These tools include summary reports of the number of chats in certain periods and the duration of such chats, filters to sort data from exit surveys, statistical summaries of those data and statistical summaries of operator performance. These administrative functions are designed to help our clients replicate traditional call center and sales support tools in an online environment.\n\nLivePerson's products and services enable clients to:\n\n\n\nMaximize Sales Opportunities. Clients can quickly and easily respond to Internet user inquiries and proactively engage top prospects on a Web site in real time. Live interaction with Internet users creates opportunities to:\n\n\n\nanswer questions on demand and resolve online customers' issues as they occur;\n\n\n\nassist in completing sales that might otherwise have been abandoned without one-to-one real-time interaction; and\n\n\n\nmarket additional products and services in order to increase average order sizes.\n\n\n\nStrengthen Relationships with Online Customers. Personalized service generates increased customer satisfaction. LivePerson's products and services enable our clients to build relationships with their online customers and offer our clients the opportunity to market to online customers on a one-to-one basis. Furthermore, transcripts from LivePerson chats and optional exit surveys often provide relevant customer data and valuable real-time feedback. Clients may then use this\n\n4\n\ninformation to modify their product offerings and marketing efforts, improve Web site navigation and refine their FAQ listings. In addition, to address a Web site visitor's time-sensitive inquiries and desire for real-time information and support, LivePerson's applications allow our clients to respond rapidly to their customers' demands.\n\n\n\nReduce Operating Costs. Customer service operators using the LivePerson service can interact with as many as four users simultaneously. As a result, an operator can provide service to more Internet users, thereby reducing cost per interaction. In addition, operators can create and use pre-formatted responses, allowing them to improve response time and operator efficiency.\n\nBecause LivePerson is an ASP and provides clients with a service rather than an in-house technology solution, clients realize the following additional benefits:\n\n\n\nLow Fees. We charge our clients reasonable ongoing fees. A set-up fee is also charged to certain of our larger clients who require more sophisticated implementation and training.\n\n\n\nEffective Use of Internal Resources. Because LivePerson's applications are outsourced, clients can devote their information technology resources to other priorities.\n\n\n\nRapid Deployment. LivePerson provides the technology needed to facilitate real-time sales and customer service without customization. Clients simply download a small client-side software program over the Internet and may immediately provide the LivePerson services to their end users. Client operators and online customers can use our services with any standard Web browser.\n\n\n\nAutomatic Upgrades. All upgrades to the LivePerson applications are installed on our servers. As a result, upgrades are immediately available and require only a minimal, menu-driven update to the client's software and no action by their customers. We provide additional training as and if required by the upgraded feature sets.\n\n\n\nEase of Expansion. All of the LivePerson applications are built for flexibility and growth. Clients can easily expand with additional services and operator licenses simply by requesting them.\n\nOur Strategy\n\nOur objective is to enhance our current position as a provider of real-time sales and customer service technology for companies doing business on the Internet. The key elements of our strategy include:\n\nStrengthening our Position in Target Markets and Growing our Recurring Revenue Base. We intend to extend our market position by significantly increasing our installed client base. We plan to continue to focus primarily on financial services companies, internal corporate call centers and small businesses as our key target markets. We intend to capitalize on our growing base of existing clients by selling them additional services and other services as online shoppers are increasingly exposed to the benefits and functionality of live text-based interaction. Increasing our client base will enable us to continue to strengthen our recurring revenue stream. We also believe that greater exposure of Internet users to our services will create additional demand for real-time sales and customer service solutions.\n\nIncreasing the Value of our Service to our Clients. We strive to continuously add new features and functionality to our live interaction platform. Because we manage the server infrastructure, we can make new features available immediately to our clients without client or end-user installation of software or hardware. We currently offer a suite of reporting and administrative tools as part of our overall suite of services. We will continue to develop more comprehensive tools for appropriate sectors of our client base, while adding further interactive capabilities. We will also continue to develop additional services that will provide value to our clients. For example, we intend to provide more robust\n\n5\n\nadvisory services to our clients that enable improved reporting capabilities, data storage and bridges to existing client systems. Our clients may use these capabilities to increase productivity, manage call center staffing, develop one-to-one marketing tactics and pinpoint sales opportunities. Through these and other initiatives, we intend to increase the value of our services to clients and their reliance on its benefits, which we believe will result in additional revenue from both new and existing clients over time.\n\nContinuing to Build Strong Brand Recognition. Our brand name is generally prominently displayed on the pop-up dialogue window that appears when an Internet user commences a text-based chat. In addition, our clients see our brand name when they log into our server infrastructure, which typically occurs on a daily basis, with many logged into our servers on a continuous basis. We believe that high visibility placement of our brand name will create greater brand awareness and increase demand for the LivePerson services. In addition, we intend to leverage increasing awareness of our brand and our reputation as a provider of real-time sales and customer service technology to become a well-recognized solution for companies doing business on the Internet.\n\nMaintaining our Technological Leadership Position. We focus on the development of tightly integrated software design and network architecture that is both reliable and scalable. We continue to devote significant resources to technological innovation. Specifically, we plan to continue to expand the features and functionality of our existing services, develop broader applications for our services and create new products and services that will benefit our expanding client base. We evaluate emerging technologies and industry standards and continually update our technology in response to changes in the real-time customer service industry. We believe that these efforts will allow us to effectively anticipate changing client and end-user requirements in our rapidly evolving industry.\n\nEvaluating Strategic Alliances and Acquisitions where Appropriate. We intend to seek opportunities to form strategic alliances with or to acquire other companies that will enhance our business. In October 2000, we acquired HumanClick Ltd., an Israeli-based provider of real-time, on-line customer service applications to small- and mid-sized businesses. In July 2002, we acquired the customer contracts and associated rights of NewChannel, Inc., a Silicon Valley based provider of proactive online sales services. We have also entered into selected strategic alliances with third-party developers to provide complementary software services to existing clients, and may enter into additional alliances in the future. We have no present plans or commitments with respect to any strategic alliances or acquisitions and we are not currently engaged in any material negotiations with respect to these opportunities.\n\nExpanding our International Presence. We have translated the user interface for the LivePerson services into eighteen languages, including Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. We are expanding our international presence to better penetrate these markets through reseller relationships in the United Kingdom, China, South Korea, Denmark and the Netherlands and are evaluating strategies to implement further international expansion.\n\nThe LivePerson Services\n\nLivePerson Service Edition\n\nLivePerson Service Edition is LivePerson's click-to-chat application. Our clients use this live chat solution to provide instant support to their customers and prospects during critical stages of online processes. With LivePerson Service Edition, clients place a LivePerson-branded or custom-created \"live help\" icon on their Web site allowing a customer browsing a client's Web site to simply click on the icon and launch a LivePerson dialogue window. A customer service or sales agent then prompts the user with an offer of assistance, commencing a real-time text-based interaction.\n\n6\n\nLivePerson provides customer support professionals with the necessary tools to run and manage a successful online customer support team. With preformatted responses, multiple chat capabilities and an advanced reporting system, LivePerson increases operator efficiency, reduces overall customer support costs and increases customer loyalty and satisfaction.\n\nLivePerson Sales Edition\n\nLivePerson Sales Edition is based on an advanced rule-based engine technology, enabling our clients to offer personalized interaction. As part of this offering, we also employ Predictive Dialer technology, enabling telemarketing call centers to optimize their agents' performance. Our business-insight group offers advanced analysis and data mining services assisting our clients in analyzing and growing their online sales.\n\nFor increased security, we use advanced firewall architecture. We also enable our clients to encrypt their sensitive data using industry standard encryption algorithms.\n\nLivePerson Pro\n\nLivePerson Pro, LivePerson's basic sales and customer service interaction tool for small- and medium-sized businesses, allows small customer service and sales operations to receive the benefits of live chat at an affordable price. LivePerson Pro contains similar features to LivePerson Service Edition, but excludes certain features, such as automatic call distribution and operations reports, designed for support teams that handle thousands of incoming chats each day.\n\nLivePerson MultiCARE\n\nLivePerson's MultiCARE solution integrates a FAQ service with email and document management. These services enhance online sales and service efforts by offering Internet users a self-help option, which is especially useful for those customers with routine inquiries. MultiCARE is a self-learning knowledge-base that uses a natural language processing engine to answer customer questions. Customers can also submit inquiries through the message management system or download a product document, brochure or application with the searchable document library, all from one common interface. MultiCARE is a tool that constantly evolves with use. It assists customers while \"learning\" how to answer questions faster and more efficiently by tracking success, relevancy and failure of searches.\n\nMultiCARE helps clients reduce customer attrition by making information and help readily available online24 hours a day, reduce customer interaction costs with self-service help for common questions, keeping support teams available for critical issues, and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty with high-value customers by providing quick resolutions to their questions and concerns.\n\nClients\n\nOur client base includes dedicated Internet companies, Fortune 1000 companies and other companies with established commercial Web sites. Our service benefits companies of all sizes doing business on the Internet. We continue to focus primarily on financial services companies, software providers, telecommunication service providers, internal corporate call centers and small businesses as our key target markets.\n\n7\n\nThe following is a representative list of our clients among those generating at least $10,000 in revenue during 2002:\n\nSales, Client Support and Marketing\n\nSales. LivePerson sells its products primarily via telephone, the LivePerson chat services or direct automated download from the Internet. Due to the relatively low start-up costs of the LivePerson services, experience has shown that purchase approval frequently comes from customer service, sales or marketing managers, and requires little or no involvement on the part of a client's information technology staff. LivePerson sells its services mainly through a direct sales organization that targets companiesprimarily financial services companies, software providers, telecommunications service providers, internal corporate call centers and small businessesseeking to improve customer relations and increase sales and lead generation online. Additionally, potential clients contact LivePerson as a result of trade show exhibits, press releases, news articles, online and offline advertising campaigns or visits to our Web site. Sales agents demonstrate the LivePerson services online and, for larger accounts, provide in-person service demonstrations.\n\nLivePerson has also begun to enter into contractual arrangements that complement our direct sales force. These arrangements primarily include sales partner organizations and individuals in key markets who receive compensation through a commission-based plan. Revenue from these partnerships is not material.\n\nClient Support. The LivePerson professional services group provides support to major clients throughout the launch of the LivePerson application and continues to manage that relationship over time. Each client has access to help desk services, while larger clients also have access to an account manager for assistance with service questions.\n\nThe following steps are required to launch a new LivePerson client:\n\n\n\nAccount Set-Up. LivePerson creates operator names and passwords for clients.\n\n\n\nSite Set-Up. Clients place a simple HTML link and/or monitoring tag on specific Web site pages.\n\n\n\nTraining. LivePerson provides onsite or telephone-based training of operators and administrators, if necessary.\n\nSet-up and training can generally be accomplished within the same day. LivePerson also maintains a 24-hour per day/seven-day per week help desk to assist clients with any technical concerns or issues.\n\nMarketing. The LivePerson marketing strategy focuses on building brand awareness of LivePerson as a provider of real-time sales and customer service technology for companies conducting business on the Internet. Marketing is targeted primarily toward financial services companies, software providers, telecommunications service providers, internal corporate call centers and small businesses. Marketing efforts consist primarily of direct communication efforts to potential and existing users through\n\n8\n\ninteractive email and real-time chat, as well as channel support through newsletters and trade publications.\n\nThe LivePerson marketing strategy also includes public relations efforts through which LivePerson participates in interviews with the media and industry analysts and that often results in published articles. Other initiatives include speaking engagements and byline articles featuring our executives. LivePerson also develops potential sales relationships through the use of case studies featuring the successes of our existing client relationships.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe market for real-time sales and customer service technology is new and intensely competitive. Relatively few substantial barriers to entry in this market exist, other than the ability to design and build scalable software and, with respect to outsourced solution providers, the ability to design, build and manage scalable network architecture. Established or new entities may enter this market in the near future, including those that provide real-time interaction online, with or without the user's request.\n\nLivePerson competes directly with companies focused on technology that facilitates real-time sales and customer service interaction. The click-to-chat application market remains fairly saturated with small companies that compete mainly on price. LivePerson faces significant competition from two customer service enterprise software providers: KANA Software, Inc. and Right Now Technologies, Inc. The current competition within the proactive sales market is minimal. The most significant barriers to entry in this market are knowledge of:\n\n\n\nonline consumer purchasing habits\n\n\n\nhow to correctly engage customers\n\n\n\nmetrics proving return on investment\n\n\n\nrecent technology innovations\n\nMany of LivePerson's competitors that offer CRM applications offer a broader range of customer relationship management products and services than we currently offer. LivePerson's core business may be disadvantaged or harmed if companies doing business on the Internet choose sales and customer service technology from other service providers.\n\nLivePerson also faces competition from larger enterprise software companies such as Oracle and Siebel Systems. In addition, established technology companies may also begin to leverage their existing relationships and capabilities to offer real-time sales and customer service applications.\n\nFinally, LivePerson competes with clients and potential clients that choose to provide a real-time sales and customer service solution in-house as well as, to a lesser extent, traditional offline customer service solutions, such as telephone call centers.\n\nLivePerson believes that competition will increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market. When compared to LivePerson, some of our larger current and potential competitors have:\n\n\n\nlonger operating histories;\n\n\n\ngreater brand recognition;\n\n\n\nmore diversified lines of products and services; and\n\n\n\ngreater financial, marketing and other resources.\n\n9\n\nSome competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and better-financed companies, enabling them to:\n\n\n\nundertake more extensive marketing campaigns;\n\n\n\nadopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\n\n\n\nmake more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services.\n\nAny delay in the general market acceptance of the real-time sales and customer service solution business model would likely harm our competitive position. Delays would allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings, and would also provide time for new competitors to develop real-time sales and customer service applications and solicit prospective clients within our target markets. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced operating margins and loss of market share.\n\nTechnology\n\nThree key technological features distinguish the LivePerson services:\n\n\n\nAll of our customers share the same servers, databases, and network connections. We are therefore able to accommodate our expanding customer base and increasing system usage in a very cost-effective manner. Our primary servers are hosted in a fully secured third-party server center in the United States and are supported by a backup server facility located offsite in the United States.\n\n\n\nOur network, hardware and software are designed to accommodate our clients' demand for secure, high-quality 24-hours per day/seven-days per week service.\n\n\n\nAs a hosted service, we are able to add additional capacity and new features quickly and efficiently. This has enabled us to immediately provide these benefits simultaneously to our entire client base. In addition, it allows us to maintain a relatively short development and implementation cycle.\n\nAs an application service provider, we focus on the development of tightly integrated software design and network architecture. We have dedicated significant resources to designing our software and network architecture based on the fundamental principles of security, reliability and scalability.\n\nSoftware Design. Our software design is based on client server architecture. As an application service provider, our customers install only the LivePerson software client (Windows or Java-based) on their operators' workstations. Visitors to our clients' Web sites use nothing more than a standard Web browser and do not need to download software from LivePerson in order to chat with our clients' operators.\n\nOur software design is also based on open standards. These standard protocols facilitate integration with our clients' legacy and third-party systems, and include:\n\n\n\nJava\n\n\n\nXML (Extensible Mark-up Language)\n\n\n\nHTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language)\n\n\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language)\n\n\n\nHTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)\n\nNetwork Architecture. The software underlying our services is integrated with a scalable and reliable network architecture. Our network is scalable; we do not need to add new hardware or\n\n10\n\nnetwork capacity for each new LivePerson client. This network architecture is hosted in a third-party server center with redundant network connections, servers and other infrastructure, ensuring high availability and up-time. We also maintain a backup server infrastructure at a remote location for effective disaster recovery.\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulation, including laws and regulations applicable to access to or commerce over the Internet. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and various other online services, it is likely that a number of new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. The nature of such legislation and the manner in which it may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined and, therefore, such legislation could subject us and/or our clients or Internet users to potential liability, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The adoption of any such laws or regulations might also impair the growth of Internet use, which in turn could decrease the demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business or in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property, taxation and personal privacy is uncertain. The vast majority of such laws was adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies.\n\nAs a result of collecting data from live online Internet user dialogues, our clients may be able to analyze the commercial habits of Internet users. Privacy concerns may cause Internet users to avoid online sites that collect such behavioral information and even the perception of security and privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our services. In addition, our clients may be harmed by any laws or regulations that restrict their ability to collect or use this data. The European Union and many countries within the E.U. have adopted privacy directives or laws that strictly regulate the collection and use of personally identifiable information of Internet users. The United States has adopted legislation which governs the collection and use of personally identifiable information of children under 13. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also taken action against Web site operators who do not comply with their stated privacy policies. Furthermore, Canada has recently adopted legislation governing the collection and use of personal information. These and other governmental efforts may limit our clients' ability to collect and use information about their Internet users through our services. As a result, such laws and efforts could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs, or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn addition to privacy legislation, any new legislation or regulation regarding the Internet, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet, could harm us. Additionally, as we expand outside the U.S., the international regulatory environment relating to the Internet could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law, written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property, to the extent that protection is sought or secured at all. We currently have one U.S. patent issued to us. To the extent that the invention described in our U.S. patent was made public prior to the filing of the patent application, we may not be able to obtain patent protection in certain foreign\n\n11\n\ncountries. In addition, we currently have two U.S. trademarks\"LivePerson Give Your Site A Pulse\" and \"HumanClick\"registered on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office primary register. We currently have one U.S. trademark\"LivePerson\"registered on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office supplemental register.\n\nAlthough we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law, written agreements and common law, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new service developments, frequent enhancements and reliable maintenance are more essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. We enter into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners, and through written agreements, control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our service or technology or otherwise develop a service with the same functionality as our products. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States.\n\nSubstantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. Our services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of services in different industry segments overlaps. Some of our competitors in the market for real-time sales and customer service solutions may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology. Although we believe that our services and technology do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and that we have all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in our business, we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether our services and technology infringe patents held by others, and we may be subject to claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Any such claims could require us to spend significant amounts in litigation, distract management from other tasks of operating our business, pay damage awards, delay delivery of the LivePerson services, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of any such infringement. Therefore, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of March 15, 2003, we had 64 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are good.\n\nWeb Site Access to Reports\n\nWe make available, free of charge, on our Web site (www.liveperson.com) our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practical, after we have electronically filed such material with, or furnished it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nWe currently lease approximately 7,000 square feet at our headquarters location in New York City, through October 2004.\n\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, HumanClick Ltd., maintains offices in Moshav Bnei Zion, Israel of approximately 3,600 square feet, under leases expiring in February 2004.\n\n12\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nOn November 16, 2001, Corio, Inc. filed a demand for arbitration against us with the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco County, California. The demand is related to a hosted software service contract terminated during 2001. Corio is seeking to recover approximately $1.4 million in damages, fees and expenses. We have filed an answer denying liability and asserting counterclaims for breach of contract and fraud, and seek a refund of all amounts paid to Corio, which equal approximately $1.5 million.\n\nAlthough we intend to defend vigorously the matter described above, and believe that we have provided adequate reserves in connection with the claim, we cannot assure you that our defense will be successful and, if it is not, that our ultimate liability in connection with the claim will not exceed our reserves or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n\nOn December 12, 2001, Compaq Financial Services Corporation, a subsidiary of Compaq Computer Corporation, filed a complaint against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. The complaint alleged that LivePerson was in default of an operating lease for computer equipment. In December 2002, the matter was settled and we paid Compaq approximately $2.1 million.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nNo matters were submitted to a vote of stockholders through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002.\n\n13\n\nPART II\n\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\n\nPRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK\n\nOur common stock was quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol \"LPSN\" from our initial public offering on April 7, 2000 until May 28, 2002, and on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market under the same symbol since that time. The following table sets forth, for each full quarterly period within the two most recent fiscal years, the range of high and low bid information (in dollars per share) of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or the Nasdaq SmallCap Market:\n\nHigh Low Year ended December 31, 2001: First Quarter $ 1.75 $ 0.25 Second Quarter $ 0.55 $ 0.20 Third Quarter $ 0.36 $ 0.07 Fourth Quarter $ 0.43 $ 0.10 Year ended December 31, 2002: First Quarter $ 0.81 $ 0.29 Second Quarter $ 0.98 $ 0.33 Third Quarter $ 0.82 $ 0.33 Fourth Quarter $ 0.94 $ 0.51\n\nHOLDERS\n\nAs of March 15, 2003, there were approximately 238 holders of record of our common stock.\n\nDIVIDEND POLICY\n\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock since our inception. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nRECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES\n\nOn December 11, 2002, we issued a warrant to purchase up to 150,000 shares of common stock at $0.69 per share to Genesis Select Corp. in exchange for investor relations services. The warrant may only be exercised for shares which are vested, according to the following schedule: 12,500 shares will vest on each monthly anniversary of the warrant issuance date for the first 12 months of the warrant's five-year term, but shares will cease to vest if Genesis Select no longer provides services to LivePerson. Genesis Select has the option to pay some or all of the purchase price upon exercise of the warrant by canceling a portion of the warrant. The issuance of the warrant was made under the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, because the issuance did not involve any public offering.\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS FROM INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\n\nOn April 12, 2000, we consummated our initial public offering of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, for which trading on the Nasdaq National Market commenced on April 7, 2000, pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1, file number 333-95689, which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 6, 2000. The managing underwriters of the offering were Chase Securities Inc., Thomas Weisel Partners LLC and PaineWebber Incorporated. The offering did not terminate until after the sale of all securities registered. The aggregate price of the offering shares was $32.0 million and our net proceeds were approximately $28.1 million after underwriters' discounts and commissions of approximately $2.2 million and other expenses of approximately $1.7 million.\n\n14\n\nExcept for salaries, and reimbursements for travel expenses and other out-of-pocket costs incurred in the ordinary course of business, none of the proceeds from the offering have been paid by us, directly or indirectly, to any of our directors or officers or any of their associates, or to any persons owning ten percent or more of our outstanding stock or to any of our affiliates. As of December 31, 2002, we have used approximately $20.1 million of the net proceeds from the offering for product development costs, sales and marketing activities and working capital and invested the remainder in cash and cash equivalents pending its use for other purposes.\n\nSECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nThe following table provides certain information regarding the common stock authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, as of December 31, 2002.\n\nPlan Category Number of Securities to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights\n\n(a) Weighted-Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights\n\n(b) Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans(3)\n\n(c) Equity compensation plans approved by stockholders(1) 7,828,334 $ 1.23 4,556,621 Equity compensation plans not approved by stockholders(2) 150,000 $ 0.69  Total 7,978,334 $ 1.22 4,556,621\n\n(1)\n\nOur equity compensation plans which were approved by our stockholders are the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\n\n(2)\n\nOn December 11, 2002, we issued a warrant to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock at $0.69 per share to Genesis Select Corp. in exchange for investor relations services. Our stockholders did not approve the issuance of the warrant.\n\n(3)\n\nExcludes securities reflected in column (a). The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan automatically increases on the first trading day in each calendar year by an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar year, but in no event shall such annual increase exceed 1,500,000 shares. The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan automatically increases on the first trading day in each calendar year by an amount equal to one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar year, but in no event shall such annual increase exceed 150,000 shares. Effective October 2001, we suspended our Employee Stock Purchase Plan until further notice.\n\nITEM 6.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Statements in the following discussion about LivePerson that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about LivePerson and our industry. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future events or results to differ materially from such statements. Any such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progress, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or the year. Although these expectations may change, we are under no obligation to inform you if they do. Our company policy is generally to provide our expectations only once per quarter, and not to update that information until the next quarter. Actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in the projections or forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the section captioned \"Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results.\"\n\nSubsequent Events\n\nOn January 22, 2003, we were notified by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. that we had regained compliance as of that date with Nasdaq's minimum bid requirement for the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.\n\nAt the Special Meeting of Stockholders of LivePerson held on January 23, 2003, our stockholders approved separate proposals to amend our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect, alternatively, one of three different reverse splits of the outstanding shares of our common stock, at a ratio of one-for-three, one-for-five and one-for-seven. Pursuant to authority granted by these proposals, our Board of Directors will have the discretion, at any time on or prior to May 30, 2003, to decide which reverse split proposal to implement, or not to effect a reverse split at all. As set forth in the proxy statement delivered to stockholders in connection with the Special Meeting, the principal purpose of each reverse split proposal is to increase the market price of our common stock above the minimum bid requirement of $1.00 per share required by Nasdaq. We do not currently intend to effect a reverse split unless required to do so in order to keep our shares of Common Stock quoted on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market; however, there can be no assurance that we will not need to or choose to effect a reverse stock split in the future.\n\nWe received a letter, dated March 18, 2003, from The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., notifying us that during the preceding 30 consecutive trading days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share as required for continued inclusion in the Nasdaq SmallCap Market under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(8)(D) (the \"Rule\"). The letter stated that we have until September 15, 2003 to demonstrate compliance with the Rule and that, if we are not in compliance by that date, Nasdaq will determine whether we meet the initial listing criteria for The Nasdaq SmallCap Market under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(2)(A). This rule states that \"[f]or initial inclusion, the issuer shall have (i) stockholders' equity of $5 million; (ii) market capitalization of $50 million...; or (iii) net income of $750,000 (excluding extraordinary or non-recurring items) in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years.\"\n\nIf we meet the initial listing criteria on September 15, 2003, we will be afforded an additional 180 calendar day grace period to demonstrate compliance with the minimum $1.00 per share bid price requirement. Further, if we have not been deemed in compliance within the second 180 day compliance\n\n17\n\nperiod, we may be afforded an additional 90 day compliance period, provided we meet the initial listing criteria for The Nasdaq SmallCap Market under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(2)(A). Otherwise, Nasdaq will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market. If such an event occurs, we may appeal the decision to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nGeneral\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available. We base these estimates on our historical experience, future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates and assumptions relate to estimates of collectibility of accounts receivable, the realization of goodwill, the expected term of a client relationship, accruals and other factors. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any differences could be material.\n\nThe significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following:\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe LivePerson services facilitate real-time sales and customer service for companies doing business on the Internet. We charge a monthly fee for our services based on usage. Certain of our larger clients, who require more sophisticated implementation and training, may also pay an initial non-refundable set-up fee.\n\nThe initial set-up fee is intended to recover certain costs (principally customer service, training and other administrative costs) prior to the deployment of our services. Such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over a period of 24 months, representing the estimated term of a client relationship. Although we believe this estimate is reasonable, this estimate may change in the future. In instances where we do charge a set-up fee, we typically do not charge an additional set-up fee if an existing client adds more services. Unamortized deferred fees, if any, are recognized upon termination of the agreement with the customer. We recognized $12,000, $286,000 and $0 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of set-up fees due to client attrition.\n\nIn the first half of 2001, we began selling the LivePerson services directly via Internet download. These services are paid for almost exclusively by credit card. Credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk, subject to the merchant bank's right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions. Sales executed via Internet download may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative, rather than through face-to-face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales. Sales of the LivePerson services via Internet download typically have no set-up fee, because we do not provide the customer with training and administrative costs are minimal.\n\n18\n\nWe record revenue for traditional direct sales and Internet download sales based upon a monthly fee charged for the LivePerson services, provided that no significant Company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. We recognize monthly service revenue fees as services are provided. Our service agreements typically have no termination date and are terminable by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice without penalty.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nOur customers are primarily concentrated in the United States. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition (except for customers who purchase the LivePerson services via Internet download) and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable, although they may change in the future. If there is a deterioration of a customer's credit worthiness or actual write-offs are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected. Our concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers. No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total revenue in 2002, 2001 or 2000. One customer accounted for approximately 16% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2002.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nPrior to January 1, 2002, we accounted for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 121, \"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.\" SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived assets, including fixed assets and goodwill, be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset to be held and used may not be recoverable, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to result from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, including fixed assets and goodwill, will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved.\n\nIn August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued SFAS No. 144, \"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,\" which supersedes both SFAS No. 121, \"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,\" and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board (\"APB\") Opinion No. 30, \"Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions,\" for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS No. 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with SFAS No. 121. For example, SFAS No. 144 provides guidance on how a long-lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when a long-lived asset is held for sale, and prescribes the accounting for a long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. SFAS No. 144 retains the basic provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). Unlike SFAS No. 121, an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144 will never result\n\n19\n\nin a write-down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under SFAS No. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\"\n\nWe adopted SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 for long-lived assets held for use did not have a material impact on our financial statements because the impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144 is largely unchanged from SFAS No. 121. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities. Therefore, we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of SFAS No. 144 will have on our future financial statements.\n\nRestructuring Activities\n\nRestructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with the guidance provided in the consensus opinion of the Emerging Issues Task Force (\"EITF\"), in connection with EITF Issue 94-3 (\"EITF 94-3\"). EITF 94-3 generally requires, with respect to the recognition of severance expenses, management approval of the restructuring plan, the determination of the employees to be terminated and communication of benefit arrangement to employees.\n\nIn July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, \"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.\" SFAS No. 146 will supersede Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, \"Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).\" SFAS No. 146 requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal plan be recognized when incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. In accordance with the standard, the Company will apply SFAS No. 146 to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, \"Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections.\" SFAS No. 4 required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be reported as extraordinary items and SFAS No. 64 related to the same matter. SFAS No. 145 requires gains and losses from certain debt extinguishment not to be reported as extraordinary items when the use of debt extinguishment is part of the risk management strategy. SFAS No. 44 was issued to establish transitional requirements for motor carriers. Those transitions are completed, therefore SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 44. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13 requiring sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions relating to sale-leaseback are effective for transactions after May 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\n\nIn November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (\"FIN\") No. 45, \"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,\" which supersedes FIN No. 34, \"Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.\" FIN No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted the disclosure provisions of FIN No. 45 as of December 31, 2002 and are currently evaluating the\n\n20\n\nrecognition and measurement provisions of the standard and have not yet determined the effect, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, \"Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of SFAS No. 123,\" which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. SFAS No. 148 also requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 as of December 31, 2002 and continue to apply the measurement provisions of APB No. 25.\n\nOverview\n\nLivePerson, a customer relationship management (CRM) application service provider (ASP), delivers real-time sales, marketing and customer service solutions for companies that conduct business online. We offer our proprietary real-time interaction technology as outsourced services. We currently generate revenue from the sale of our LivePerson services, which enable our clients to communicate directly with Internet users via text-based chat, and to a lesser extent from related professional services. With the LivePerson chat services, our clients can respond to Internet user inquiries in real-time, and can thereby enhance their Internet users' online shopping experience.\n\nWe were incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 1995 and the initial LivePerson service was introduced in November 1998.\n\nOn May 28, 2002, our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, following approval by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. of our May 14, 2002 application to transfer the listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq National Market to the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.\n\nIn July 2002, we acquired all of the existing customer contracts of NewChannel, Inc. and associated rights. The purchase price was based, in part, on projected revenue from each of the former NewChannel clients at the time of their successful conversion to the LivePerson software platform. As of December 31, 2002, we have incurred total acquisition costs of approximately $1.3 million, including the initial purchase price payment of $600,000 to NewChannel. We expect the total cost of the transaction to be less than $1.4 million. The total acquisition cost has been allocated to customer contracts and is being amortized ratably over a period of 18 months, representing our current estimate of the expected term of the client relationships. The net amount is included in Other intangibles, net on our December 31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet.\n\nRevenue\n\nWith respect to LivePerson's services, our clients pay us a monthly fee for our services based on usage. Certain of our larger clients, who require more sophisticated implementation and training, may also pay an initial non-refundable set-up fee. Our set-up fee is intended to recover certain costs incurred by us (principally customer service, training and other administrative costs) prior to deployment of our services. Such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over a period of 24 months, representing the estimated expected term of the client relationships. As a result of recognizing set-up fees in this manner, combined with the fact that a small proportion of our clients are charged a set-up fee, revenue attributable to our monthly service fee for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 accounted for 97%, 90% and 85%, respectively, of total LivePerson services revenue. In addition, because we typically do not charge a set-up fee for sales generated via Internet download, we expect the set-up fee to continue to represent a decreasing percentage of total revenue over time. In instances where we do charge a set-up fee, we typically do not charge an additional set-up fee if an existing client adds more services. Our service agreements typically have no termination date\n\n21\n\nand are terminable by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice without penalty. We recognize monthly service revenue fees and professional service fees as services are provided. Professional service fees consist of training provided to customers. Given the time required to schedule training for our clients' operators and our clients' resource constraints, we have historically experienced a lag between signing a client contract and generating revenue from that client. This lag has generally ranged from one day to 30 days. There is no lag for sales generated via Internet download, because our services are immediately available and fully functional upon download. To date, revenue from professional services has not been material.\n\nIn the first half of 2001, we began selling the LivePerson services directly via Internet download. These services are paid for almost exclusively by credit card. Credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk, subject to the merchant bank's right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions. Sales executed via Internet download may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative, rather than through face-to-face or telephone contact which is typically required for traditional direct sales. Sales of the LivePerson services via Internet download typically have no set-up fee, because we do not provide the customer with training, and administrative costs are minimal. We recognize monthly service revenue fees from Internet downloads as services are provided.\n\nWe also have entered into contractual arrangements that complement our direct sales force and online sales efforts. These are primarily with Web hosting and call center service companies, pursuant to which LivePerson is paid a commission based on revenue generated by these service companies from our referrals. To date, revenue from such commissions has not been material.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOur cost of revenue has principally been associated with the LivePerson services and has consisted of:\n\n\n\ncompensation costs relating to employees who provide customer service to our clients;\n\n\n\ncompensation costs relating to our network support staff;\n\n\n\nallocated occupancy costs and related overhead; and\n\n\n\nthe cost of supporting our primary and backup infrastructure, including expenses related to leasing space and connectivity for our services, third-party network monitoring and depreciation of certain hardware and software.\n\nOur product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software. Product development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.\n\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales personnel and marketing personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, advertising, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials, travel expenses and trade show exhibit expenses.\n\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting and human resources personnel, allocated occupancy costs and related overhead, professional fees, provision for doubtful accounts and other general corporate expenses.\n\n22\n\nIn 2001, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to approximately $1.5 million from $577,000 at December 31, 2000, principally due to an increase in accounts receivable and deteriorating aging due to slower collections. A significant portion of this increase was due to overdue accounts receivable balances from our Internet-related clients with limited operating histories, many of which began to face difficult market conditions in the prior year, and, in particular, during the nine months ended September 30, 2001. During 2001, we wrote off approximately $1.3 million of previously reserved accounts, leaving an allowance of $160,000 at December 31, 2001. We base our allowance for doubtful accounts on specifically identified doubtful accounts plus a general reserve for potential future doubtful accounts. We adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts when accounts previously reserved have been collected.\n\nWe did not increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in the three months ended December 31, 2001 or the year ended December 31, 2002. This is attributable to the fact that our accounts receivable collections improved beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001, due primarily to the significantly larger percentage of our total outstanding accounts receivable being comprised of businesses with more established and proven operating histories, and to a lesser extent, to the fact that an increased number of our clients now pay us by credit card, which transfers the collection risk to the credit card provider.\n\nNon-cash Compensation Expense\n\nDuring May 1999, we issued an option to purchase 94,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.60 per share to ShopNow.com Inc. (now known as Network Commerce Inc.), a client, in connection with an agreement to provide the LivePerson services to Network Commerce for two years. We were to receive subscription revenue from Network Commerce over the two-year period based on the number of LivePerson Chat operator access accounts the client was using. As discussed below, the option was amended in February 2000. The original terms of the option provided that it would vest on or before May 2001, if revenue generated by Network Commerce met certain targets. We granted the option as an incentive for entering into a two-year service agreement with us, at a point in time when the LivePerson services were new and their viability was unknown. The option had no minimum revenue guarantee, and was exercisable for a period of three years from the date of grant. We accounted for this option in accordance with EITF Abstract No. 96-18, \"Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.\" Pursuant to EITF No. 96-18, we valued the option at each balance sheet date using a Black-Scholes pricing model as of each balance sheet date. The unamortized value ascribed to this option was adjusted at each balance sheet date to bring the total ascribed value of the option up to the then current unamortized fair value. This cost was then ratably amortized over the two-year service agreement, as we believed that the achievement of the revenue targets was probable.\n\nIn February 2000, we amended the option agreement. Under the amendment, the option became fully vested and immediately exercisable, and Network Commerce exercised the option in May 2000. Network Commerce agreed, however, that it could not sell the underlying common stock until the earlier of five years or, if certain revenue criteria were met, May 19, 2001. The value ascribed to the option at the time the option agreement was amended, using a Black-Scholes pricing model, was $1,014,000, which was being amortized ratably over the remaining service period of approximately fifteen months because the vesting of the option did not affect our obligation under the service agreement. In addition, the ratable amortization of the remaining deferred cost of $1,014,000 reduced the revenue we recognized from Network Commerce with any excess amortization recorded on a quarterly basis as sales and marketing expense, which was reflected as a non-cash compensation expense in our statement of operations. We amortized $723,000 of the deferred costs during the year ended December 31, 2000, of which $59,000 was offset against the $59,000 of revenue recognized from Network Commerce. The remaining $664,000 of sales and marketing expense was included in non-cash compensation expense in our 2000 statement of operations.\n\n23\n\nAs of March 31, 2001, we determined that it was unlikely that Network Commerce would meet the remaining revenue requirements under the agreement. Accordingly, we amortized the remaining deferred cost of $291,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2001, of which $54,000 was offset against the $54,000 of revenue recognized from Network Commerce. The remaining $237,000 of sales and marketing expense was included in non-cash compensation expense in our statement of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2001.\n\nDuring 2000 and 1999, we granted or assumed stock options to purchase 5,730,727 and 3,496,245 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $3.62 and $1.37, per share, respectively, certain of which were granted at less than the deemed fair value of the common stock at the date of grant. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, we recorded deferred compensation of approximately $18.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively, in connection with the options granted at below the deemed fair value. The aggregate amount of unamortized deferred compensation related to the grant of options which was subsequently reversed against additional paid-in capital in connection with the forfeiture of those options granted at below the deemed fair value, and associated with employees who left LivePerson during the year ended December 31, 2000, was approximately $5.4 million. In 2000, we also recorded $272,000 of deferred compensation relating to the intrinsic value of unvested options assumed by us in connection with the HumanClick acquisition. These amounts were presented as deferred compensation in our 2000 consolidated financial statements and were amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options.\n\nThe net non-cash compensation amounts for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 consist of:\n\n2002 2001 2000 (in thousands)\n\nMay 1999 option granted to a client (discussed above) $  $ 237 $ 664 Amortization 365 833 13,938 Acceleration of deferred compensation charges related to certain employee terminations  616 666 Reversal of previously amortized deferred compensation charges due to forfeitures of employee stock options  (1,009 ) (2,023 ) Total $ 365 $ 677 $ 13,245\n\nThe aggregate amount of unamortized deferred compensation reversed against additional paid-in capital was approximately $34,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, and represents the forfeiture of options associated with employees who voluntarily left LivePerson during 2002. The aggregate amount of unamortized deferred compensation reversed against additional paid-in capital for the year ended December 31, 2001 was approximately $2.9 million. This amount represents the forfeiture of options associated with LivePerson's employees whose employment was terminated as part of our restructuring initiatives.\n\nThe net non-cash compensation amounts for the year ended December 31, 2001 exclude the net non-cash compensation credit of $1.7 million related to our restructuring initiatives in the first quarter of 2001 (see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements).\n\nExcluding the net non-cash compensation credit of approximately $1.7 million related to our restructuring initiatives in the first quarter of 2001, the net non-cash compensation charge of $677,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, includes $237,000 related to the May 1999 option granted to Network Commerce (discussed above), $833,000 of amortization expense and $616,000 of charges related to acceleration of vesting of options in connection with the termination of the employment of certain employees, and approximately $1.0 million of credits due to forfeiture in connection with the termination of the employment of certain employees.\n\nRestructuring\n\nIn the first quarter of 2001, following a review of our business in connection with our acquisition of the private Israeli company HumanClick Ltd. in October 2000, we commenced restructuring\n\n24\n\ninitiatives to streamline our operations, including the consolidation of our two San Francisco Bay area offices. The restructuring resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately 90 people as of the end of the first quarter of 2001. In the first quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of approximately $3.4 million for severance and other expenses related to the restructuring. In the third quarter of 2001, in a continued effort to streamline our operations, we initiated additional restructuring initiatives and recorded a charge of approximately $9.3 million. These initiatives resulted in the elimination of redundant staff positions, and the decision to relocate our principal executive offices, which included the termination of an office space lease (and the entering into of a new three-year lease that commenced in November 2001). The restructuring resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately 20 people, the write-off of impaired computer equipment and software and the write-off of certain furniture, equipment and building improvements. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded net charges of approximately $12.7 million for our various restructuring initiatives.\n\nIn connection with our third quarter 2001 restructuring initiatives, we consolidated all of our clients onto a single software application platform and network. The new platform provided our customers with a more dependable product and reduced our cost of providing these services. Our network is hosted by a third-party provider of secure server hosting services located in the United States. While the cost of providing our services as a result of these initiatives has decreased, we are dependent on our third-party server hosting provider for redundant network connections, server maintenance and general security. We have not experienced any material product instability or operational consequences since the implementation of these initiatives. We have also consolidated our product development, help desk and online sales personnel in our Israel office. As a result, the political, economic or military conditions affecting Israel could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel or our business.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2002, in accordance with EITF 94-3, we incurred an additional restructuring charge related to our 2001 restructuring initiatives. This $1.2 million charge primarily related to the unfavorable settlement of a previously disclosed legal proceeding in excess of the provision initially provided for by management in connection with its original restructuring plan. The legal proceeding was the result of the termination of an operating lease for computer equipment that supported our application platform prior to the consolidation of all clients onto a single application platform in the third quarter of 2001 (see Item 3\"Legal Proceedings\").\n\nResults of Operations\n\nDue to our acquisition of the NewChannel customer contracts and associated rights in July 2002, our acquisition of HumanClick in October 2000, our significant restructuring initiatives during 2001 and our limited operating history, we believe that comparisons of our 2002, 2001 and 2000 operating results with each other, or with those of prior periods, are not meaningful and that our historical operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance.\n\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001\n\nRevenue. Total revenue increased to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was due primarily to the acquisition of the NewChannel customer contracts and associated rights in July 2002 and, to a lesser extent, to the introduction of a new range of services and increased market acceptance of our services. Revenue in 2002 and 2001 included the recognition of $12,000 and $286,000, respectively, of set-up fees due to client attrition. Unamortized deferred fees, if any, are recognized upon termination of the agreement with the client. We cannot assure you that we will achieve similar revenue growth, if any, in future periods.\n\nCost of Revenue. Cost of revenue consists of compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer service to our clients, compensation costs relating to our network support staff, the cost of supporting our infrastructure, including expenses related to leasing space and connectivity for our services, third-party monitoring services, as well as depreciation of certain hardware and software,\n\n25\n\nand allocated occupancy costs and related overhead. Cost of revenue decreased to $1.6 million in 2002, from $6.7 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to reduced spending requirements associated with supporting our infrastructure as a result of our 2001 restructuring initiatives, including the consolidation of our clients onto a single customer application platform and the cancellation of operating leases for certain computer equipment in the third quarter of 2001. The decrease is also attributable, to a lesser extent, to reduced allocated occupancy costs and related overhead.\n\nProduct Development. Our product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for product development personnel. Product development costs decreased to $1.3 million in 2002, from $3.5 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in outsourced labor costs and to our 2001 restructuring initiatives, which resulted in fewer employees, streamlined operations and reduced spending requirements in 2002, including relocating software development activities to our Israel office in the third quarter of 2001.\n\nSales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel, as well as advertising and public relations expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $2.2 million in 2002, from $5.1 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to reduced print advertising expense and to our 2001 restructuring initiatives, which resulted in fewer employees, streamlined operations and reduced spending requirements.\n\nGeneral and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting, human resources and administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses decreased to $2.8 million in 2002, from $5.7 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to our 2001 restructuring initiatives, which resulted in fewer employees, streamlined operations and reduced spending requirements, including the termination of our office lease agreement for our former principal executive offices in the third quarter of 2001.\n\nAmortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Amortization expense was $357,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002 and relates to acquisition costs recorded as a result of our acquisition of the NewChannel customer contracts and associated rights in July 2002. Amortization expense was $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2001 and relates to goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of HumanClick in October 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we did not record any amortization expense related to the goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of HumanClick. The decrease in amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the comparable period in 2001 is attributable to an accounting change related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, described under the caption \"Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change\" below.\n\nNon-Cash Compensation Expense, Net. Non-cash compensation expense consists primarily of amortization of deferred stock-based compensation. Deferred stock-based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to employees. Deferred compensation has been amortized over the vesting period of the individual options. In 2002, we recorded non-cash compensation expense of $365,000, a decrease from $677,000 in 2001. This decrease is due primarily to the forfeiture of employee stock options, and associated deferred stock based compensation, associated with employees who were terminated as a result of our 2001 restructuring initiatives. The net non-cash compensation amounts for the year ended December 31, 2001 exclude the net non-cash compensation credit of $1.7 million related to our restructuring initiatives in the first quarter of 2001.\n\nOther Income. Interest income was $126,000 and $538,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents generated by the receipt of proceeds from our initial public offering in 2000 and preferred stock issuances in 2000 and 1999. Interest expense was $10,000 and $10,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. (See \"Part II. Item 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder MattersUse of Proceeds from Initial Public Offering.\") Other income was $0 and $109,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and consists primarily of\n\n26\n\namortization of deferred gain on the sale-leaseback of certain computer equipment which was terminated as a result of our third quarter 2001 restructuring initiatives.\n\nCumulative Effect of Accounting Change. On January 1, 2002, we were required to adopt the full provisions of SFAS No. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\" SFAS No. 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. This testing requires the comparison of carrying values to fair value and, when appropriate, requires the reduction of the carrying value of impaired assets to their fair value.\n\nThe transitional impairment analysis required upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 was completed during the first quarter of 2002, and we determined that there was an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill. As part of this analysis, we determined that LivePerson continued to operate in one operating segment and that we do not have any separate reporting units under SFAS No. 142; accordingly, the impairment analysis was performed on an enterprise-wide basis. This process included obtaining an independent appraisal of our fair value as a whole and of our individual assets. Fair value was determined from the same cash flow forecasts used in December 2001 for the evaluation of our carrying value under SFAS No. 121, \"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,\" which was the accounting rule for impairment of goodwill that preceded SFAS No. 142 and was effective through December 31, 2001. The valuation methodology required by SFAS No. 142 is different than that required by SFAS No. 121. An impairment is more likely to result under SFAS No. 142 because it requires, among other items, the discounting of forecasted cash flows as compared to the undiscounted cash flow valuation method under SFAS No. 121, among other items.\n\nThe allocation of fair values to identifiable tangible and intangible assets as of January 1, 2002, resulted in an implied valuation of the goodwill of $0. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as determining the amount of goodwill that would have been required to be recognized in a business combination. That is, under SFAS No. 142, an entity is required to allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire it. Comparing this implied value to the carrying value resulted in an impairment of $5.3 million, with no income tax effect. This impairment is recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change on our statement of operations as of January 1, 2002.\n\nNet Loss. Our net loss decreased to $6.8 million in 2002, from $27.3 million in 2001. The net loss for 2002 includes the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $5.3 million related to the impairment of goodwill described above, partially offset by the fact that we did not record any amortization of goodwill related to our acquisition of HumanClick in 2002. In comparison, we recorded approximately $3.0 million of goodwill amortization in 2001.\n\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000\n\nRevenue. Total revenue increased to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase was due primarily to the introduction of a new range of services, increased online marketing ef"
