They must take into account customer preferences, needs and wants as well, and strive to create a foundation of shared information and insight over time There are a myriad of studies that show how effective CRM systems are in transforming businesses and making them more customer-centric, profitable and responsive to rapidly changing market requirements. The level of adoption and continued use of CRM systems also assures a company's culture stays agile enough to respond to changing market conditions while also keeping the level of expertise and knowledge about customers continually growing (Chen, Chiu, 2010). Having a single system of record pertaining to all customer interactions give companies a competitive advantage in that they have greater insight into how prospects make buying decisions (Wang, Feng, 2012). When implementing a CRM system there are five critical success factors that are essential to its success and these include cost, risk, scope, time, and quality. The most effective CRM implementations that deliver the greatest value balance all five of these factors and synchronize them together to create strategies that deliver consistently profitable results. These five critical success factors are essential\n\nAuto retailers were considered to be \"doomed\" by the Internet as a result of increasing competition from online car-selling services. The most important and challenging for auto dealers is that while still demanding traditional car-buying experiences, customers want to modify their options in various situations (Collins 2002).

CRM is difficult to manage in terms of technology, people, initial money investment, safety of information that companies need to keep about their customers, sharing information with third party, and its overall maintaining or protection. CRM success is based upon the organizations ability to detect and respond to current customer’s needs and their preferences.

That’s because during his nearly 20 years at Dow Corning, a global manufacturer of silicon-based products, he was one. He knows all too well that salespeople ignore any new administrative process or technology unless it allows them to make more sales or use their time more efficiently. Now, as Dow Corning’s director of marketing and sales processes, Reeves is leading the company’s convergence of its CRM and e-business efforts, as well as streamlining its compliance and reporting functions.

The loss of relevancy within a customer base immediately opens it up to competitors, drastically increasing the costs to get them back and re-establish value of products and services (Allen, Carletti, Leonello, 2011). Lack of customers will also lead to lack of insight into demand curves of products and the inability to forecast them accurately (Docters, Durman, Korman, Schefers, 2008). Integrating Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems into the daily activity of a company is essential to alleviate this problem (Bielski, 2003). Failing to integrate CRM systems into the overall workflow of the company will lead to losing even more customers and lost revenue, and this is especially true for foreign subsidiaries of global companies (Davids, 1999).\n\nA CRM program contains complicated business and technology issues.

Some companies have the luxury of routinely working with the same set of customers in a fairly personal manner. These companies tend to be in the small business category, which affords them certain advantages relative to customer service that medium and large sized businesses simply cannot compete with. For many businesses they are turning to a technology solution to solve the problems they run into in the area of customer service. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems were created in order to help businesses avoid common pitfalls that can ruin a businesses relationship with its valued customers. Many of these pitfalls involve poor communication; Customer Relationship Management Systems will aide users in many ways relative to improving customer communications.
