        "text": "Upgrade cycles are all around us. They explain the adoption of cars, cell phones, GPS trackers, and the software systems that help your company operate and compete. Every piece of new technology that you adopt is replacing an existing process or solution. That decision to replace can be explained through the relevant upgrade cycle.\n\nA humble foray into technology investing\n\nI first heard the term “upgrade cycle” when one of my colleagues used it to describe the growth of unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”).\n\nAt first, the acronym UCaaS intimidated me. It was hard enough to wrap my head around the broader telephony market, let alone an awkward five-letter acronym that referred to a distinct market subsegment (the shortcomings of a college economics major). Despite my initial naiveté, the “upgrade cycle” concept helped me understand the benefits of UCaaS* without a technical degree or experience in the field.\n\nI soon realized the prevalence of upgrade cycles in every technology market, and I’ve been leveraging the concept as part of building investment theses ever since.\n\nWhat is an upgrade cycle?\n\nLeveraging a framework that makes sense to me, I’ll attempt using supply and demand curves to explain. In upgrade cycles, think of “supply” as technology innovation and “demand” as the consumers and businesses buying that technology (e.g. new smartphones or CRM systems, which we will discuss).\n\nAn upgrade cycle is when new technology innovation unlocks demand from consumers and businesses, but supply is nascent and has yet to satisfy that demand. This creates a tension in the market which leads to growth in supply.\n\nAs technology investors, this tension is what we look for, and our investment typically supports and fuels that growth in supply. In other words, we look for technology that everyone needs but only one (or a few) companies have figured out how to provide.**\n\nA classic example\n\nIf telephony networks and economics aren’t your thing, here’s an accessible example: smartphones.\n\nIt’s early 2007 and you’re carrying a flip phone, a palm pilot, an mp3 player, and a camera on your family vacation. In June, Apple releases the iPhone and offers you the convenience of all of those devices with the added benefit of surfing the internet in the palm of your hand. There’s limited supply and from one supplier, Apple!*** Apple’s business then grows to meet demand. You retire your flip phone, palm pilot, mp3 player, and camera in one fell swoop by adopting the new iPhone. You have just participated in the smartphone upgrade cycle.\n\nApplying upgrade cycles to B2B software\n\nThe value proposition during the advent of the smartphone was obvious. However, in B2B upgrade cycles the value proposition is typically more complex. For one thing, we’re not talking about changing the way you operate, we’re talking about changing the way a team or an entire business operates. Let’s use Salesforce as an example:\n\nIt’s 2006 and your business is using an outdated instance of Siebel Systems to host your customer data. Siebel was just acquired by Oracle, and you’re buried in a long list of customers that are waiting for the latest system maintenance and upgrade, which requires human capital resources to arrive on your premises where the software is hosted. You get a sales call from a new company called Salesforce, offering to upgrade your legacy, on-premise CRM system with a brand new, cloud-based version of the same thing. There are several considerations here:\n\nCost: Salesforce is pitching you an annual subscription fee that is higher than your annual maintenance cost with Siebel. Plus, you already paid a license that gives you perpetual access to Siebel. All that said, your service quality from Siebel is proving to be pretty abysmal…\n\nChange Management: everyone at your organization is trained to use Siebel. Implementing a new system not only requires the cost associated with migrating data and customization / configuration, but also requires time (which is money) to train your team on an entirely new system.\n\nEase of use & deployment: with Salesforce, you can say goodbye to scheduling maintenance and waiting for upgraded instances and additional features. Having immediate access to the most sophisticated technology and features would mean your business will also have a more sophisticated go-to-market engine vs. competitors, providing an advantage for as long as others are sticking with their old systems. On the flip side, if your competitors upgrade and you don’t, they’ll be the ones with the competitive advantage.\n\nScalability: your business is growing, and your CRM database is growing alongside it. With Siebel, you need to make sure your on-premise data center can handle the excess capacity which may require investing in additional servers over time. With Salesforce, your subscription only increases with seat-count, and includes an unlimited amount of storage.\n\nUltimately, you need to make the business case that the increase in sophistication (i.e. potential for revenue growth) and scalability (i.e. cost savings) over time will result in positive ROI despite the sunk costs associated with the investment you’ve already made in Siebel and change management required to migrate. You are navigating the cloud CRM upgrade cycle.\n\nAs evidenced by the examples above, the considerations are much more complex when it comes to B2B upgrade cycles. With more complexity, catalyzing demand isn’t just about a great product combined with great marketing**** — it typically requires the market to be at a tipping point due to strong tailwinds, allowing buyers to make a compelling case for ROI. Understanding these tailwinds is crucial to timing the market, whether you’re an investor evaluating a new investment or an entrepreneur starting a business.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of timing\n\nAs most entrepreneurs will tell you, timing is everything. If the market is not ready for a new technology, that technology won’t experience broad market adoption, no matter how much capital you raise or invest. Bringing us back to our supply and demand example, if the timing is wrong, new technology won’t unlock strong demand, and you’ll see limited growth potential for supply.\n\nIt is important here to distinguish wrong timing from low awareness. Early in their life, upgrade cycles may be serving broad market needs with low awareness. In a “low awareness” situation, you have to educate your market in order to increase demand (often through investments in sales & marketing). However, in a “wrong timing” situation, the demand curve simply won’t budge, no matter how much you invest in educating your market.\n\nHow to achieve “right timing”\n\nThe best way to avoid wrong timing and answer the question, “why now?” is to understand broader market tailwinds.\n\nMarket tailwinds could include things like an evolving regulatory environment (like carbon taxes in the EHS market), increasingly complex requirements (like omni-channel fulfillment in the retail/ecommerce market), or a skills gap (like the need for cloud engineers in the cloud online learning market). In other words, why is this new technology not just better than old technology, but necessary in today’s market?\n\nSome buying decisions are more complex than others — sometimes the new way of doing things is simply much better than the old way. But for the fastest growing, most capital efficient businesses, there’s no doubt that strong market tailwinds are a key contributor to success. It’s what companies like Salesforce, Ford, and TikTok all have in common.\n\nUnderstanding why this matters\n\nFor Entrepreneurs and CEOs: Although I’ve never been one, here are the glaring reasons upgrade cycles should matter to entrepreneurs and CEOs: (1) it is common entrepreneurial wisdom that a product / solution / service should be solving a problem for the end customer; (2) product roadmaps depend on market and customer needs; (3) sales reps need to have the ability to articulate ROI and (4) marketing teams need to create messaging that resonates with the market. How does this all come together? By understanding the upgrade cycle relevant to your market. Going back to the Salesforce example, if that rep isn’t able to help you weigh the benefits and challenges of implementing a new CRM, it probably won’t lead to a buying decision.\n\nFor Investors: Investors get lucky all the time, especially in a bull market. But how do we control our luck across macroeconomic cycles?\n\nThe best advice I’ve received when it comes to market volatility is that as long as you’re investing in businesses that benefit from strong, resilient market tailwinds, market volatility may elongate your hold period but should not affect the ultimate outcome. Said differently, you need to prove not only that you’re investing in an innovative product that delivers ROI, but that the market timing is right where demand is strong enough to fuel growth for years to come.\n\nThis is why having a strong grasp on the relevant upgrade cycle of a business should matter to investors: it is the best way to predict the future and control your own luck.*****\n\nA Helpful Framework\n\nThe beauty of technology is that it touches every industry. The challenge then, as an investor, is the constant re-education that comes with each investment opportunity. We know that we will never understand an end market the way an entrepreneur who lives and breathes it does — and it’s important to respect that while trying to be as knowledgeable as we can.\n\nBut there is something that both entrepreneurs and investors have in common when it comes to understanding a market, and that is the importance of timing. Understanding and articulating the relevant upgrade cycle is a framework for cutting through the complexity and answering the question we all have — why now?"
