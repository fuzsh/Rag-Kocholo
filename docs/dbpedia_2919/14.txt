Cubesat Space ProtocolÂ¶

Cubesat Space Protocol (CSP) is a small protocol stack written in C. CSP is designed to ease communication between distributed embedded systems in smaller networks, such as Cubesats. The design follows the TCP/IP model and includes a transport protocol, a routing protocol and several MAC-layer interfaces. The core of libcsp includes a router, a socket buffer pool and a connection oriented socket API.
