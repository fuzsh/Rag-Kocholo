This network of satellites and ground stations allows data to be efficiently downlinked. However, to create a networking protocol for constellations of small Earth observing satellites, several limitations need to be addressed, including distributed topology management, slow downlink data-rates, and single point-to-point communication. Since distributed satellite constellations exacerbate the severity of these limitations, a thorough analysis of a constellation's network performance is required to ensure that task objectives are achievable. In this paper, we compared low Earth orbit(LEO) Earth observing satellite constellations using delay tolerant networking protocols and the user datagram protocol (UDP). The constellations' inter-satellite links and downlinks were evaluated using network metrics such as access window time, drop-ratio, and throughput. We simulated these network metrics using the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3). Previous works have proposed satellite constellations for Earth observation, however, constellations of small satellites have not been analyzed for network metrics. Results show that a sun-synchronous constellation with a repeating ground track outperforms a flower constellation with respect to increased access time, reduced drop-ratio, and higher throughput. The simulations also determined the optimum media access control slot time and packet transmission intervals for long distance satellite links. Additionally, we were able to compare the throughput performance of UDP to abundle protocol by adding nodes with delay tolerant networking protocol implementations.\n\nKeywords: Communication networks, Delaytolerant networking (DTN), Network topology, Satellite communication, Satellite constellations, Network simulations, User datagram protocol (UDP), Vehicular networks, Wireless mesh networks"
