Is it possible that congestion is an earthly phenomena- byproduct of human freewill and hardly be an issue in cold lifeless space until it is deeply colonized? Can one conceive a space routing protocol which will require zero inter-router communication and still route packets with absolute precision? In this report we examine the technical nature of the notion of mobility and connectivity in the context of space networking and seek answers to the questions like above.\n\nSupport for the Internet Paradigm in the Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT)\n\nCarl Sunshine\n\nThe Aerospace Corporation\n\n310-336-6991\n\nsunshine@aero.org\n\nTSAT is being designed to provide a combination of circuit and packet communications services for mobile and deployed military users in the next decade. TSAT will extend Internet technology into space, with attention to the extra security, endurance, and priority requirements necessary in a military environment. The briefing will summarize the baseline Government Reference Architecture for the system, with emphasis on meeting the challenges of extending the Internet architecture into a military space environment.\n\nGetting to Lunar Sorties: The Need for IP Protocols and Industrial-Strength Solutions for Near-Term Lunar Human Mission Goals\n\nStephen Braham, Simon Fraser University PolyLAB, Vancouver, Canada\n\nwarp@polyfab.sfu.ca\n\nAbstract:\n\nInternetworking Over SpaceWire: Design of a Non-Broadcast Address Resolution Protocol and Encapsulation Service\n\nSandra G. Dykes, Robert Klar, Allison Roberts, Buddy Walls, Mark A. Johnson, Kristian Persson\n\n{sandra.dykes, robert.klar, allison.roberts, buddy.walls, mark.johnson, kristian.persson}@swri.org\n\nSouthwest Research Institute\n\n6220 Culebra Rd., San Antonio TX, 210.522.3329\n\nStandard communication protocols and existing OS network stacks can reduce software development time, cost, and errors. For this reason, spacecraft onboard communication systems are gradually moving from shared bus architectures to switched networks and standard protocols.\n\nEthernet is the dominant switched network technology on Earth, and is one contender for the space environments. In Ethernet, the switches are responsible for link-layer broadcasts. To avoid forwarding loops, the switches must continuously learn network topology and build a minimum spanning tree for message delivery. However, these algorithms add complexity and circuitry which increases mass and power requirements.\n\nSpaceWire, a recent ESA standard, is gaining popularity because of its simple circuitry, low power consumption, and high-link speed. Although SpaceWire has many advantages, it lacks a link-layer broadcast mechanism. Broadcasts are necessary to support automatic network configuration and discovery software such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Address resolution tables and host IP addresses are manually configured on SpaceWire networks. Moreover, the SpaceWire standard does not yet specify a method for supporting multiple upper layer protocols such as IP and CCSDS.\n\nThis presentation will describe the design of a link-layer broadcast service and an encapsulation service for SpaceWire. The encapsulation service provides a message multiplexing / demultiplexing functionality that enables multiple higher-layer protocols to operate over the same physical link. Implementing this service in the host driver software enables SpaceWire to automatically and simultaneously support IPv4, IPv6 and CCSDS SCPS-NP protocol stacks, as well as high-performance custom applications that interface directly to the driver.\n\nOur link-layer broadcast mechanism is implemented at the hosts rather than at the SpaceWire routers. The design is compliant with the SpaceWire specification and can be implemented solely within the driver software. No changes are required to the SpaceWire specification, routers, or host interface hardware. The algorithm introduces the concept of a SpaceWire subnet, which consists of a router and its directly connected hosts. The advantage of this approach is that it avoids configuration by using either SpaceWire port addressing or its packet distribution mechanism.\n\nWe believe the ability of our protocols to simplify network management and to support IP and other higher-layer protocols is an important step forward and will lead to more rapid adoption of SpaceWire for future missions.\n\nSpace OSPF - Shortest Delay Intermittent Pathway Routing With Mobile Routers\n\nNouman Bantan & Javed I. Khan\n\nInternetworking and Media Communications Research Laboratories\n\nDepartment of Computer Science, Kent State University\n\n233 MSB, Kent, OH 44242 USA\n\nnbantan@cs.kent.edu & javed@kent.edu\n\nOSPF routing protocol has powerful scalability and stability features because of its ability to divide routing domain into areas and messages into short on-demand link state messages. Recently, we have proposed a space version of OSPF routing called Space OSPF. This protocol is capable of handling intermittent paths and model-based router mobility in addition to its powerful scalability features. It can compute shortest delay paths over conventional concurrent link based pathways as well as on intermittent non-concurrent link based pathways for store-and-forward communication. In this paper we will present the performance of this new protocol in real space scenarios. It dramatically improves on several other routing algorithms proposed for space with near optimum routing performance.\n\nLessons learned using Flight IP on moderate fidelity testbed with Radhard Cisco router\n\nBy\n\nGreg Menke\n\nNASA Goddard Spaceflight Center\n\nHugh Arif\n\nGlobal Defense, Space and Security Group\n\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n\nNASA Goddard Spaceflight Center has many initiatives exploring the use of IP in space missions. One missing element in the communications chain has been a COTS flight-qualified, rad-hard IP router. Recognizing that, Cisco Systems and NASA Goddard teamed to work together in developing a port of Cisco's IOS (Internet Operating System) to a rad-hard platform with widely accepted flight credentials.\n\nThis paper contains the benchmark and testing results of a flight-qualified, rad-hard Cisco router acting as the primary communications interface of a simulated spacecraft with IP as the end-to-end communications protocol.\n\nCPU and memory utilization figures are given for clear text and encrypted space-link communications. Operational configuration scenarios are discussed and conclusions are reached about the unique\n\nrequirements COTS IP routers must work under when integrated into spacecraft.\n\nIP For Responsive Microsats  A Practical Approach\n\nAssi Friedman, afriedman@innoflight.com\n\nJeffrey Janicik, jjanicik@innoflight.com\n\nInnoflight Inc.\n\n5850 Oberlin Dr.\n\nSuite 340\n\nSan Diego, CA 92121\n\nPhone: (858) 638-1580\n\nFax: (858) 638-1581\n\nwww.innoflight.com\n\nUsing Internet Protocols on smallsats started as a grass roots effort to take advantage of commercial hardware and software and save development time, money, and reduce risk. These premises are still exist today within the community. In addition, even though the primary users of microsats nowadays are government customers (in the U.S.) the motivation for fast responsive microsats is inline with the original premises.\n\nThere are many spacecraft tracking stations available for government and commercial networks in the U.S. yet only few can support IP operations as a standard feature. Capitalizing on the benefits that IP can provide to us will come into play only if we can establish an operational baseline that is cost effective and easy for spacecraft designers to implement. Using protocol on protocol or unique and proprietary encoding methods defeats the point as it is as efficient as designing your own in-house system.\n\nInnoflight has been working on a number of microsat IP technology solutions that will enable spacecraft builders to purchase COTS IP enabled hardware and software package for both the ground and flight segments. This presentation will describe how Innoflight integrated traditional IP/HDLC with CCSDS standards, and Type-1 encryption to provide users with secure, high performance IP link between the spacecraft LAN and the ground segment.\n\nVOIP over Space Networks\n\nC. Okino, W. Kwong, J. Pang, J. Gao, and L. Clare\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nIn this work, we examine the use of off-the-shelf Voice-over-IP (VOIP) for the space environment. Our initial focus is on VOIP based on open source implementations of the Session Initiation Protocol SIP (RFC 3261) and the Real Time Protocol RTP (RFC 3550). We also investigate SIP extensions to enable voice operations in situations where potentially there is only a simplex link or one direction of the duplex path suffers a substantial outage during a connection. We examine the use of VOIP applications for lunar space scenarios. Results are derived using our space communications testbed, which incorporates underlying space network protocols and captures channel error and propagation delay effects. We address the impacts of the unique characteristics and needs of the space environment in the performance measurements for voice.\n\nClayton Okino\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\n\nPasadena, CA 91109\n\n(818) 393-6668\n\nClayton.M.Okino@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nWinston Kwong\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\n\nPasadena, CA 91109\n\n(818) 354-5953\n\nWinston.Kwong@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nJackson Pang\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\n\nPasadena, CA 91109\n\n(818) 393-0466\n\nJackson.Pang@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nJay Gao\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\n\nPasadena, CA 91109\n\n(818) 354-9528\n\nJay.L.Gao@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nLoren Clare\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\n\nPasadena, CA 91109\n\n(818) 354-1650\n\nLoren.P.Clare@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nA Security Model for Space Based Communications\n\nThom Stone\n\nComputer Sciences Corporation\n\nNASA Ames Research Center\n\nM/S 258-6\n\nMoffett Field, CA 94035\n\n650.604.4971\n\ntstone@arc.nasa.gov\n\nRaymond Gilstrap, Kenneth Freeman\n\nNASA Ames Research Center\n\nM/S 258-5\n\nMoffett Field, CA 94035\n\n650.604.3844. 650.604.1263\n\n{ray.gilstrap, kenneth.freeman-1}@nasa.gov\n\nAs space missions become more complex and interactive the need for a comprehensive and rigorous security infrastructure becomes obvious. This framework should include all elements including space assets, ground systems, and distribution of data products.\n\nAlthough a myriad of security products and solutions have been developed recently, a comprehensive, directed methodology for implementing the correct technologies for space missions has not been developed. Based on our experience with securing NASAs supercomputer assets and a high-speed wide area network we will present the requirements for space mission security. This will include an overview of current Internet-based security technologies and how they were assessed for inclusion in the NASA Research and Engineering Network (NREN) security plan and later implemented. Further discussion will include strategies for developing a viable security framework, security for onboard payload, operations in a secure environment and securing data products distributed to a wide array of off-site and out of agency principal investigators.\n\nA Preferred Service Architecture for Payload Data Flows\n\nRay Gilstrap\n\nKen Freeman\n\nThom Stone\n\nAbstract:\n\nSimulation of Delay-Tolerant Network Protocols in Space Networks\n\nJohn Segui and Esther Jennings\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, Ca 91109\n\nJohn.Segui@jpl.nasa.gov, Esther.Jennings@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n(818) 354 9191, (818) 354 1390\n\nIn space exploration missions, the coordinated use of spacecraft as communication relays increases the efficiency of the endeavors. To conduct trade-off studies of the performance and resource usage of different communication protocols and network designs, JPL designed a comprehensive extendable tool, the Multi-mission Advanced Communications Hybrid Environment for Test and Evaluation (MACHETE). The design and development of MACHETE began in 2000 and is constantly evolving.\n\nCurrently, MACHETE contains Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) protocol standards such as Proximity-1, Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS), Packet Telemetry/Telecommand, Space Communications Protocol Specification (SCPS), and the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). MACHETE uses the Aerospace Corporations Satellite Orbital Analysis Program (SOAP) to generate the orbital geometry information and contact opportunities. Matlab scripts provide the link characteristics. At the core of MACHETE is a discrete event simulator, QualNet.\n\nDelay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is an end-to-end architecture providing communication in and/or through highly stressed networking environments. Stressed networking environments include those with intermittent connectivity, large and/or variable delays, and high bit error rates. To provide its services, the DTN protocols reside at the application layer of the constituent internets, forming a store-and-forward overlay network. The key capabilities of the bundling protocols include custody-based reliability, ability to cope with intermittent connectivity, ability to take advantage of scheduled and opportunistic connectivity, and late binding of names to addresses.\n\nIn this presentation, we report on the addition of MACHETE models needed to support DTN, namely: the Bundle Protocol (BP) model. To illustrate the use of MACHETE with the additional DTN model, we provide an example simulation to benchmark its performance. We demonstrate the use of the DTN protocol and discuss statistics gathered concerning the total time needed to simulate numerous bundle transmissions.\n\nModeling Sparse, Mobile Ad hoc Networks with Strong Physical Layer Interactions\n\nDavid Finkleman\n\nAnlaytical Graphics, Inc.\n\nAbstract:\n\nDynamic Bandwidth Allocation for a\n\nSpace-to-ground Relay Network\n\nHui Zeng*, Michael Hadjitheodosiou & John S. Baras\n\nHyNet, Institute for Systems Research\n\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park,\n\nMD 20742\n\nE-mail: {zengh, michalis, baras}@umd.edu\n\nWe focus on the allocation of bandwidth in a space relay network that supports several scientific spacecraft with a number of different streams on-board sharing a broadband satellite channel to send traffic to the ground. Our system model includes a number of mobile spacecraft (MS) in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO), a Geo-synchronous (GEO) relay satellite, and the ground network consisting of several ground stations (GS). The downlink channel of the relay satellite is shared by these spacecraft, which we model as streams with different priority levels going through a common queue and a router. The data will be delivered to the ground station through this relay.\n\nIt is shown that a carefully designed time-varying bandwidth allocation based on the instant or statistical traffic from all users/flows performs better in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. However, only short-term (time varying) bandwidth allocation may cause instability and will have difficulties in providing QoS guarantees and managing the long-term (average) behavior of all the users/flows. Hence, we propose a two-level bandwidth allocation in our implemented TDMA scheme. For a well-coupled framework with per user/flow average bandwidth management, we derive our long-term bandwidth allocation problem from the model discussed by Kelly, and draw some ideas from some other work. In addition, for instantaneous bandwidth management, we incorporate ideas from some recent work to formulate the short-term timeslot assignment problem and find the solution for optimal timeslot scheduling.\n\nBy using simulation, the performance of a suitable MAC protocol with two-level bandwidth allocation is analyzed and compared with that of the existing static fixed-assignment scheme in terms of ETE delay and successful throughput. We also study the fairness among all the users under a special scenario and find that the pseudo-proportional fairness is achieved for our hybrid protocol.\n\n*Corresponding Author:\n\nHui Zeng\n\nHyNet, Institute for System Research,\n\nA.V.

The specific environment chosen for the studies is the landing environment of the Mars rovers. The general technique that has been developed can be applied to any location where suitably-detailed terrain information is available.\n\nThe first phase of the project concerned acquiring high-resolution terrain data for the candidate landing sites and then making that data accessible for importation into commercial link planning software. The link planning software chosen was that used for planning cellular telephone links. This software uses ray-tracing techniques for radio propagation from a source to destination and not statistical estimation techniques.\n\nThe second phase of the project is to use the terrain data and the link planning software to obtain RF coverage estimates and power delay profiles. These estimates are gotten at a number of locations within the predicted MER landing ellipses to see what variations can be found. The simulation estimates are validated against measurements made with local terrain features.\n\nThe third phase of the project is to use the link predictions to estimate the effective performance of 802.11 wireless links in the outdoor environment. From the terrain data, we obtain estimates of the percent coverage, expected throughput of 802.11a and 802.11b links, and expected throughput based on modulation types (PSK-based or OFDM).\n\nThis technique can be applied to other terrain environments, e.g. the lunar environment, if sufficient imaging and terrain composition details are known to generate the coverage models."
