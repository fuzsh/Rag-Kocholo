        "text": "GomSpace provides multiple powerful on-board computers miniaturized to small PCBs, yet it includes many features needed to run the satellite platform.\n\nGiven the small size the OBC can be mounted on a PC104 board with other GomSpace modules like radio transceivers or GPS modules.\n\nSoftware is half of the mission and well thought out, integrated and tested software significantly increases the flexibility and outcome of the mission.\n\nGomSpace’s software philosophy is based on viewing the whole mission as a network containing a number of autonomous nodes that can communicate transparently with each other in a distributed architecture. To support this view, we have developed the Cubesat Space Protocol (CSP) to be the internal satellite bus protocol. Using this a radio device can be considered a “router” that connects different physical CSP networks.\n\nThe GomSpace Hardware Platform also supports the distributed architecture and when combining the GomSpace Software and Hardware Platform, the step towards a fully integrated satellite is very small and low risk, leaving more time and resources for mission specific payload integration.\n\nThe distributed architecture is characterised by:\n\nAutonomous nodes\n\nAll nodes can be operated and controlled from Ground Station\n\nAll nodes can communicate with each other\n\nPlug-and-Play design philosophy, enabled by CSP\n\nLearn more"
