        "text": "Secure exchange of data and information is the main concern for the digital world these days. It is still not clear how well the tons of information on the internet we share is protected and advanced cybersecurity measures are more crucial than ever.\n\nAware of this imminent hacking threat of sensitive and utmost important data, the European Commission has, for these past years, put in motion different programs to find solutions on how to protect all communications within the European region. To do this, it is essential to improve and maximize security protocols with its feasible integration into current communication channels, such as 5G, which not only involves ground but also satellite communications.\n\nQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an ultra-secure form of encryption based on the laws of quantum mechanics that allows data and communications to be transmitted with unconditional security.\n\nThe QKD is proving to be a protocol that can be easily integrated into current technologies that are being used to transmit information throughout the European continent.\n\nOn the other side, 5G is the fifth generation of wireless communication, that will soon become the standard for virtually every major telecommunication service provider, as defined by the standards organization 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). Both QKD and 5G technologies require a satellite network for global coverage of their services.\n\nThe EU-funded project QUANGO aims at designing and prototyping the key elements of a satellite mission that targets the delivery of both internet of things (IoT) and QKD services.\n\nStellar Project is part of the QUANGO project, coordinated by the University of Padova, in collaboration with the research institutions ICFO, Sorbonne University, University of Malta, and the companies Sateliot, and Argotec.\n\nThe project aims to design a secure communication network implementing Quantum technologies, 5G communications, and nanosatellites. More specifically, the project aims to design a 12U-CubeSat low-earth-orbit satellite constellation, deployed in an orbit in space at 600km, that will combine capabilities for secure communications with QKD and 5G connections.\n\nStellar Project is developing the optomechanical system, providing a fast, and precise pointing and a large aperture telescope; that in less than 6 CubeSats units provide secure communication for 5G networks.\n\nQUANGO will carry out laboratory demonstrations of critical components, subsystems, and payloads and study their implementation feasibility. It will then pioneer the integration of QKD security systems into 5G protocols aiming to create, in the long run, a 5G-QKD satellite constellation that can cover all European areas and offer maximum security in communications.\n\nQUANGO will provide a new paradigm to share the satellite infrastructure required for secure communication based on quantum technologies and for 5G communication. It will help lay the groundwork for the future Quantum European Infrastructure, a pan-European quantum communication infrastructure that uses satellite as well as ground-based solutions to connect and link European regions and cities.\n\nABOUT CORDIS\n\nThe Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS) is the European Commission’s primary source of results from the projects funded by the EU’s framework programs for research and innovation (FP1 to Horizon 2020).\n\nThe CORDIS mission is to bring research results to professionals in the field to foster open science, create innovative products and services and stimulate growth across Europe.\n\nCORDIS is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union on behalf of the European Commission’s research and innovation Directorates-General, Executive Agencies, and Joint Undertakings, supported by specialized contractors for editorial, data, and technical services.\n\nCORDIS is one of the cornerstones of the Commission’s strategy to disseminate and exploit research results and it is governed and funded as part of the Horizon 2020 framework program.\n\nABOUT STELLAR PROJECT\n\nStellar Project is a space technology startup created in 2016 as a spin-off of the University of Padova, Italy, offering game-changing solutions for light satellites with a high degree of care towards space environmental sustainability.\n\nStellar Project aims to fill the gap in performances and capabilities between small satellites and large spacecraft, providing original and proprietary technology.\n\nIn 2016, Marco Ramadoro – space business entrepreneur – Alessandro Francesconi – space systems Professor at the University of Padua (Italy) – and Federica Fistarollo – lawyer and manager – started the Project united by shared values.\n\nThe vision behind the company is to join the global new space democratization, bringing together the best talented minds to create a space that allows the development of bright ideas into smart and light space products and services.\n\nStellar Project – Bright & Light\n\nFor more information, do not hesitate to get in touch with us."
