        "meta_description": "NASA's future vision for interplanetary networking includes a lunar network, Cube Satellite (CubeSat) constellations, and deep space robotic missions, comprising what could be viewed as a network of networks. Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and protocols provide a standard network layer among these varying scenarios and mitigate many challenges of the space environment, such as long delays, unplanned service interruptions, and asymmetric links. The Cognitive Space Gateway (CSG) is a routing method in a DTN architecture that uses spiking neural networks as the learning element to optimize routing decisions in a complex environment.\n\nThis work aims to further develop cognitive networking technologies in several critical areas, including DTN, the CSG algorithm, CubeSat swarm topologies, and cloud services. To test the algorithm in a realistic scenario, the emulated network topology is based on a CubeSat swarm. The swarm may function as a mesh of nodes or as a hub-and-spoke network.  An emulation environment will be built upon a commercial cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud. The cloud environment may enable a flexible, lower maintenance approach versus a multi-hop network based in a physical laboratory. The cloud platform will provide a secure environment allowing for collaboration among government and academic entities.",
