        "text": "Apart from their size and cost, the biggest advantage of a nanosatellite is the short time period required to develop each model. An average-sized or large satellite requires between 5 and 15 years to identify the need and place it in the right orbit under normal parameters.\n\nSo what are the implications of this? Well, between the start and end of operations, needs may well have changed, which means that the initially planned uses are no longer market-appropriate. What’s more, telecommunications technologies are constantly changing and being updated, which means that conventional satellites eventually end up operating with 15-year-old technologies. It is impossible to constantly update large satellites, which means that they cannot be modified even when a market or technology opportunity arises.\n\nHowever, this is not the case of nanosatellites: it can take less than 8 months to detect a need and place them in orbit.\n\nIn addition to guarantees of redundancy and robustness, nanosatellite constellations provide a system in which the concepts of obsolescence or useful life are no longer an issue. The very nature of nanosatellites means that constellations are regularly renewed, ensuring a consistent state-of-the-art system, the result of ongoing technological upgrades.\n\nThis constant renewal ensures that the constellation owner can provide an optimum technological service at all times.\n\nDeveloping small satellites in accordance with CubeSat standards contributes to cutting the costs of research and technical phases. This contributes significantly to overcoming the entry barrier to space, which has led to a sharp hike in CubeSats’ popularity since its introduction.\n\nDepending on the specifications, a nanosatellite can be built and placed in orbit for 500,000 euros. In comparison, the cost of a conventional satellite can be as high as 500 million euros.\n\nParticularly worthy of mention is the emergence of micro-launchers around the world; dedicated exclusively to placing small satellites in orbit, they have lowered launch costs.\n\nIn addition to the actual development of each satellite, launching a nanosatellite as part of a constellation allows for the risk involved in any space mission to be divided up amongst smaller segments.\n\nAs a result, if a nanosatellite is lost or one of the units fails, it can be rapidly replaced within feasible time periods and at a reasonable cost. In contrast, the failure of a large-scale satellite may well jeopardise the entire mission.\n\nThe reduced cost of nanosatellites does not mean that they are less reliable. With the right methodologies during both the satellite design and testing phases, the success of a mission can be guaranteed, leaving only those factors that cannot be controlled to chance: incidents such as launch failures, solar storms or the impact of a meteorite or piece of space junk.\n\nNanosatellite Launch Procedure\n\nOnce the nanosatellite has been developed, tested and is ready for operations, it must be placed in orbit. There are currently multiple launch options for nanosatellites, including the shared use of government agency rockets, private company launchers or logistic links with the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nCubeSats take up reduced amounts of volume and mass, making them easy to load onto spacecraft as well as a low cost solution.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of micro-launchers around the world, dedicated exclusively to placing small satellites in orbit, has forced the market to lower launch prices.\n\nÓrbaita polar\n\nSatellites travel around the Earth in circular or elliptical orbits thanks to the balance between the gravitational and escape pull during launch. The absence of air means that there is no friction to alter the equation and they can remain in orbit practically indefinitely.\n\nWhen a nanosatellite comes to the end of its operational life, it re-enters the atmosphere and disintegrates.\n\nLow Altitude\n\nAs a general rule, nanosatellites are launched in low circular or elliptical orbits (altitudes of between 400 and 650 km) and travel at around 8 km per second. At this altitude and height, it takes them around 90 minutes to orbit the Earth, completing between 14 and 16 orbits a day. These conditions are ideal for nanosatellites.\n\nBy orbiting closer to the Earth, they not only guarantee optimum conditions for land observation or communications, but are also better protected from solar and cosmic radiation.\n\nWhat is a Nanosatellite Constellation?\n\nNanosatellites are groups of constellations that provide backing, redundancy and granularity for the services they provide. Each satellite within a constellation is renewed every 2-4 years, thereby guaranteeing that the operator will always have an optimised low risk service that receives ongoing technological upgrades.\n\nNanosatellite constellations are therefore systems in which the concepts of obsolescence or useful life are no longer an issue.\n\nThe beginning of this century saw the emergence of CubeSats, a new paradigm in the satellite industry. They are radically smaller than conventional satellites, resulting in lower costs, which offsets the reduced risk of failure and shorter useful life, which is nevertheless acceptable for numerous applications.\n\nThe special nature of nanosatellites does not prevent them from carrying out the same tasks as larger devices. The features naturally differ, but are sufficient for multiple industrial applications."
