        "text": "View Part 1, Introduction to New Space, and Part 2, Cybersecurity Threats in New Space, in this series.\n\nAs we see in the previous article of this series discussing the cybersecurity threats in the New Space, space technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate — with new technologies being launched into orbit at an increasingly rapid pace.\n\nThe need to ensure the security and safety of these technologies has never been more pressing.\n\nSo, let’s discover a range of measures to secure the space systems.\n\nSecurity by design\n\nSecurity by design is an approach to designing systems, products, or applications with security as a primary consideration from the outset, rather than adding it as an afterthought.\n\nSecurity by design is an important consideration in the New Space industry because New Space companies are often startups or smaller companies that are developing innovative solutions to space-related challenges, and security by design is essential to ensure the safety, reliability and security of these new technologies and satellites.\n\nOne of the key components used in the New Space industry is the software defined radio (SDR).\n\nLet’s dive deeper into the application of a security by design approach for an SDR architecture.\n\nSecure SDR architecture\n\nSoftware defined radio is the new groundbreaking technology leading this new space era.\n\nThus, securing the SDR architecture is an essential step in preventing cyberattacks.\n\nThe European Secure Software Defined Radio (ESSOR) is a project created by nine European countries. It seeks to develop mutual technologies for European military radios and provide a secure communication system.\n\nNASA also developed a Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture standard.\n\nThe purpose is to develop an SDR architecture security by design.\n\nSDR architecture is composed of a software part and a hardware part. There were many proposals to secure the SDR architecture addressing the software part as well as the hardware part.\n\nOn the one hand, a proposed secure SDR architecture focusing on hardware is the new spectrum management architecture. This design is based on an automatic and calibration & certification unit (ACU), a radio security module (RSM) and a built-in GPS receiver.\n\nProposed SDR hardware architecture\n\nThe ACU is a hardware radio frequency (RF) manager. It checks output power spectrum compliance with the local radio regulation parameters. The ACU is integrated between the programmable physical layer and the RF modules.\n\nRSM is the security manager of the hardware; the local radio regulation parameters are securely downloaded to the hardware and stored in the RSM. It manages the software life cycle — downloading, installation, operation and termination.\n\nThis architecture relies on a security module, based on software or tamper-proof hardware, to secure the software operations (download and installation) or the radio frequency configuration parameters.\n\nOn the other hand, a proposal for securing SDR based on software architecture looks as follows.\n\nThere are some software SDR architecture components that need to be secured.\n\nThe new proposed architecture is based on two key concepts. The first key is the separation between the application environment and the radio operating environment so that the compromise of one does not affect the other.\n\nThe second key is the check against security policies of all the SDR reconfiguration parameters created by the application environment before they result in impact on the radio environment.\n\nTraditional (a) and proposed (b) secure architecture of SDR\n\nThe defined SDR secured architecture includes a secure radio middleware (SRM) layer. It contains the components that need to be secured: radio applications (RA) and the radio operation environment (ROE).\n\nRA is a software component in SDR that controls the radio by implementing the air interface and modulation and communication protocols. RA needs to be protected because a hacker can reconfigure it with erroneous parameters (frequency, modulation, etc.).\n\nROE contains the fundamental core components for the radio platform operation.\n\nThe SRM layer is built under the user application environment (UAE) layer (OS); thus, it’s immune to UA and UAE compromises.\n\nThis secure layer contains verification mechanisms that ensure the radio reconfigurations compliance with the security policies.\n\nProactive defense\n\nProactive defense in cybersecurity refers to the measures and strategies designed to prevent a potential cyber threat to assets and systems before they can cause harm.\n\nBy taking a proactive approach in space systems, New Space companies can better protect themselves against potential cyberattacks and minimize the impact of any security breaches that do occur.\n\nProactive defense in space systems may include measures like:\n\nRisk assessments\n\nVulnerability management\n\nPatch management to apply software patches and updates with the aim to fix flaws and vulnerabilities\n\nThreat modeling by identifying potential threats and attack vectors\n\nAttack surface management\n\nEndpoint protection with behavioral analysis and machine learning capabilities\n\nSecurity awareness training for space system operators to educate potential space security risks and best practices\n\nOffensive security assessments including pentest and red team campaigns to apply an adversarial approach and determine the weaknesses in the space system components.\n\nA proactive approach can help to ensure the safe and effective operation of space-based assets and systems and can also help to maintain the integrity of critical space-based infrastructure.\n\nReactive defense\n\nReactive defense refers to the approach of responding to cyber threats and attacks after they have already occurred.\n\nThe reactive cyber defense measures may include:\n\nForensic analysis to determine the root cause of a security incident after it has occurred\n\nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to collect, analyze and respond to security events and alerts from various sources within the space system components\n\nIncident response with the development of plans and procedures to respond to security incidents, such as a data breach or a cyberattack on a satellite or ground station\n\nDisaster recovery plan.\n\nA reactive approach is very important to minimize the damage caused by a cyberattack and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.\n\nHowever, by combining proactive and reactive defense measures, space industry actors can create a comprehensive security strategy that addresses both the prevention and response to cyberattacks.\n\nIdentity and access management\n\nIdentity and access management (IAM) for space assets is an essential measure to improve security posture and streamline how users and consumers access resources and services.\n\nIn the ground segment, command and control centers require IAM controls.\n\nGround station components like the payload control station, flight control station and SDR need to be secured by strict access control policies.\n\nRegarding space vehicles, access control needs to be implemented for SDR, data handler and flight computer components to authorize only legitimate users to access sensitive data and satellite commands.\n\nSpace industry actors need to adopt an identity and access management strategy as a part of building an enduring security program using a zero trust approach so that they can:\n\nEstablish a state of least privilege so no user has any more access than what’s needed\n\nVerify continuously, as users access data and tools\n\nAlways assume a breach.\n\nSignal authentication\n\nSignal authentication is one of the essential mechanisms that can protect satellite communication from attacks like jamming, eavesdropping or spoofing.\n\nMost of the satellites use broadcast flow to send data downlink to the ground station — GNSS data is one such example.\n\nAccording to research developed by Qascom company, the GNSS Authentication protocols can be categorized into three domains: data level, signal Level, and hybrid level.\n\nData level authentication\n\nIn data level authentication schemes, we talk about cryptography.\n\nTo ensure the integrity, authentication and non-repudiation of exchanged data, we need a broadcast data authentication scheme.\n\nThe simplest broadcast data authentication schemes are based on message authentication codes (MACs), which provide data integrity and data authentication, and digital signatures (DSs), which address integrity, authentication and non-repudiation.\n\nThese schemes include three main families: block hashing, hash chaining and MAC-based source authentication schemes.\n\nTimed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) is an example of an authentication protocol using MAC-based source authentication schemes. TESLA protocol is known for its robustness to Denial-of-Service attacks.\n\nNavigation Message Authentication (NMA) is also a concept of data-level authentication introduced in 2005 to provide authenticity and integrity to the navigation message stream.\n\nSignal level authentication\n\nSignal level schemes refer to the spread of spectrum signal properties. Leveraging these signal level schemes, it’s hard for an attacker to demodulate the signal without knowledge of the secret code.\n\nSpread spectrum security codes (SSSCs) and signal authentication sequences (SAS) are schemes that were proposed as signal level authentication.\n\nHybrid level authentication\n\nHybrid authentication is a solution that combined both data and signal level authentication. Hence, the concept of supersonic codes is introduced.\n\nThe supersonic codes are block ciphered and in code phase with open codes, and the same code is repeated for a predefined security period. This allows direct authentication without time dependency, as opposed to stream-cipher-based solutions.\n\nThe protocol focused to deliver a very fast authentication scheme that does not require time knowledge.\n\nThe supersonic authentication scheme is robust against known GNSS attacks such as spoofing and replay.\n\nCryptography\n\nQuantum key distribution\n\nQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an emerging technique that relies on the unique properties of quantum mechanics and provides tamper-evident communication used to deploy new cryptographic keys with unconditional post-quantum security and without direct physical contact.\n\nIn 2016, China launched a satellite-based quantum cryptography: Micius Satellite.\n\nThe satellite had successfully demonstrated the feasibility of satellite-based quantum cryptography and has been used for communication between a fiber-based QKD backbone and remote areas of China.\n\nPost-quantum cryptography\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is an alternative approach to secure communication and data exchange between satellites and ground stations. Unlike QKD, PQC uses cryptography and mathematical calculation to develop secure cryptosystems for both classical and quantum computers.\n\nIn July 2022, The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the first quantum-safe cryptography protocol standards for cybersecurity in the quantum computing era.\n\nIn 2016, contenders from all over the world submitted 69 cryptographic schemes for potential standardization. NIST later narrowed down the list of candidates over three stages, eventually shortlisting seven finalists — four for public key encryption and three for digital signatures. At the end of a six-year-long process, three of the four chosen standards were developed by the IBM team, in collaboration with several industries and academic partners. They include the CRYSTALS-Kyber public-key encryption and the CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signature algorithms, which were chosen as primary standards. The Falcon digital signature algorithm was chosen as a standard to be used in situations where the use of Dilithium would be space prohibitive.\n\nSecurity protocols and standards\n\nAs discussed earlier in this series, satellite communications are very exposed to adversary cyberattacks. Many errors and vulnerabilities exist and have been exploited.\n\nSecurity against communication attacks has become a major issue. The need for safe and correct communication protocols is necessary.\n\nThe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has developed a recommendation standard for the Space Data Link Security Protocol (SDLS).\n\nThe CCSDS protocols were developed specifically for space use tackling the use of packet telemetry.\n\nThe SDLS Protocol is a data processing method for space missions that need to apply authentication and/or confidentiality to the contents of transfer frames used by Space Data Link Protocols over a space link. The Security Protocol is provided only at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI Basic Reference Model.\n\nThe purpose of the Security Protocol is to provide a secure standard method, with associated data structures, for performing security functions on octet-aligned user data within Space Data Link Protocol transfer frames over a space link.\n\nRegarding CubeSats, a communication implementation in open source is preferable. CubeSat Space Protocol (CSP) is a lightweight, small network-layer delivery protocol designed for CubeSats communications. CSP ensures encryption and integrity.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology published in December 2022 an interagency report (NIST IR 8401): a cybersecurity framework for the satellite ground segment of space operations.\n\nThe purpose of this framework is to assist the operators of the commercial ground segment in providing cybersecurity for their systems, managing cyber risks, and addressing the Space Policy Directive 5 (SPD-5) goals for space cybersecurity. SPD-5 is the nation’s first comprehensive cybersecurity policy for space systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe development and deployment of space technology in the New Space age bring with it a new set of cybersecurity challenges. With the increasing number of satellites and spacecraft being launched, it is essential that we ensure their secure design, operation and communication to prevent cyberattacks that could compromise sensitive data or disrupt satellite services.\n\nLooking forward, the future development of New Space technology holds great promise, with the potential for even more significant discoveries and advancements in various areas. So, what are the future development areas and challenges for the New Space industry? The next article in this series will bring the answer to that question."
