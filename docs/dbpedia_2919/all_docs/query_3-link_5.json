        "text": "For CSP 1.x, Yamcs does include some reusable pre/post processors here:\n\nYou can use these in combination with one of the regular links, or your own. For example a bidirectional UDP link:\n\nAnd for the MDB definition, there is an example here (in XTCE format):\n\nWe're using these in an integration where some kind of proprietary RPC-style protocol over CSP is used, between space and ground.\n\n\n\nHi Fabian, thanks for pointing me in the direction of these, it's really useful.\n\nThinking about this further, I guess using CSP replaces the CCSDS equivalents of Space Datalink Frames and Space Packet Protocol. So I'm wondering if higher level protocols which normally run over these CCSDS ones can run over CSP? I'm thinking specifically of CFDP, which I know is supposed to be independent of the lower level protocols. In the context of the Yamcs CFDP implementation, do you think it would be possible to get it to work using CSP in substitution for the CCSDS protocols?\n\nRegards\n\nBrian\n\n"
