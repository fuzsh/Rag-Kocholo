CubeSat development projects have been initiated through educational outreach partnerships with schools and universities, commercial partnerships and internal training initiatives. KSC has also been involved in CubeSat deployment through programs to find launch opportunities to fly CubeSats as auxiliary payloads on previously planned missions and involvement in the development of new launch capabilities for small satellites. This overview will highlight the CubeSat accomplishments at KSC and discuss planning for future projects and opportunities.\n\nNASA's Space Launch System: A New Opportunity for CubeSats\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHitt, David; Robinson, Kimberly F.; Creech, Stephen D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDesigned for human exploration missions into deep space, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) represents a new spaceflight infrastructure asset, enabling a wide variety of unique utilization opportunities. Together with the Orion crew vehicle and ground operations at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, SLS is a foundational capability for NASA's Journey to Mars. From the beginning of the SLS flight program, utilization of the vehicle will also include launching secondary payloads, including CubeSats, to deep-space destinations. Currently, SLS is making rapid progress toward readiness for its first launch in 2018, using the initial configuration of the vehicle, which is capable of delivering 70 metric tons (t) to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). On its first flight, Exploration Mission-1, SLS will launch an uncrewed test flight of the Orion spacecraft into distant retrograde orbit around the moon. Accompanying Orion on SLS will be 13 CubeSats, which will deploy in cislunar space. These CubeSats will include not only NASA research, but also spacecraft from industry and international partners and potentially academia. Following its first flight and potentially as early as its second, which will launch a crewed Orion spacecraft into cislunar space, SLS will evolve into a more powerful configuration with a larger upper stage. This configuration will initially be able to deliver 105 t to LEO and will continue to be upgraded to a performance of greater than 130 t to LEO. While the addition of the more powerful upper stage will mean a change to the secondary payload accommodations from Block 1, the SLS Program is already evaluating options for future secondary payload opportunities. Early discussions are also already underway for the use of SLS to launch spacecraft on interplanetary trajectories, which could open additional opportunities for CubeSats. This presentation will include an overview of the SLS vehicle and its capabilities, including the current status of progress toward\n\nProject ELaNa and NASA's CubeSat Initiative\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSkrobot, Garrett Lee\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis slide presentation reviews the NASA program to use expendable lift vehicles (ELVs) to launch nanosatellites for the purpose of enhancing educational research. The Education Launch of Nanosatellite (ELaNa) project, run out of the Launch Services Program is requesting proposals for CubeSat type payload to provide information that will aid or verify NASA Projects designs while providing higher educational research\n\nCubeSat evolution: Analyzing CubeSat capabilities for conducting science missions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPoghosyan, Armen; Golkar, Alessandro\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTraditionally, the space industry produced large and sophisticated spacecraft handcrafted by large teams of engineers and budgets within the reach of only a few large government-backed institutions. However, over the last decade, the space industry experienced an increased interest towards smaller missions and recent advances in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology miniaturization spurred the development of small spacecraft missions based on the CubeSat standard. CubeSats were initially envisioned primarily as educational tools or low cost technology demonstration platforms that could be developed and launched within one or two years. Recently, however, more advanced CubeSat missions have been developed and proposed, indicating that CubeSats clearly started to transition from being solely educational and technology demonstration platforms to offer opportunities for low-cost real science missions with potential high value in terms of science return and commercial revenue. Despite the significant progress made in CubeSat research and development over the last decade, some fundamental questions still habitually arise about the CubeSat capabilities, limitations, and ultimately about their scientific and commercial value. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the state of the art CubeSat capabilities with a special focus on advanced scientific missions and a goal of assessing the potential of CubeSat platforms as capable spacecraft. A total of over 1200 launched and proposed missions have been analyzed from various sources including peer-reviewed journal publications, conference proceedings, mission webpages as well as other publicly available satellite databases and about 130 relatively high performance missions were downselected and categorized into six groups based on the primary mission objectives including \"Earth Science and Spaceborne Applications\", \"Deep Space Exploration\", \"Heliophysics: Space Weather\", \"Astrophysics\", \"Spaceborne In Situ\n\nInterplanetary CubeSat Navigational Challenges\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMartin-Mur, Tomas J.; Gustafson, Eric D.; Young, Brian T.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCubeSats are miniaturized spacecraft of small mass that comply with a form specification so they can be launched using standardized deployers. Since the launch of the first CubeSat into Earth orbit in June of 2003, hundreds have been placed into orbit. There are currently a number of proposals to launch and operate CubeSats in deep space, including MarCO, a technology demonstration that will launch two CubeSats towards Mars using the same launch vehicle as NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) Mars lander mission. The MarCO CubeSats are designed to relay the information transmitted by the InSight UHF radio during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) in real time to the antennas of the Deep Space Network (DSN) on Earth. Other CubeSatts proposals intend to demonstrate the operation of small probes in deep space, investigate the lunar South Pole, and visit a near Earth object, among others. Placing a CubeSat into an interplanetary trajectory makes it even more challenging to pack the necessary power, communications, and navigation capabilities into such a small spacecraft. This paper presents some of the challenges and approaches for successfully navigating CubeSats and other small spacecraft in deep space.\n\nVenture Class Launch Services\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWiese, Mark\n\n2016-01-01\n\nProvide an introduction to the Launch Services Program, and specifically the strategic initiative that drove the Venture Class Launch Services contracts. Provide information from the VCLS request for proposals, as well as the Agency's CubeSat Launch Initiative.\n\nELaNa - Educational Launch of Nanosatellite Enhance Education Through Space Flight\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSkrobot, Garrett Lee\n\n2011-01-01\n\nOne of NASA's missions is to attract and retain students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Creating missions or programs to achieve this important goal helps strengthen NASA and the nation's future work force as well as engage and inspire Americans and the rest of the world. During the last three years, in an attempt to revitalize educational space flight, NASA generated a new and exciting initiative. This initiative, NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellite (ELaNa), is now fully operational and producing exciting results. Nanosatellites are small secondary satellite payloads called CubeSats. One of the challenges that the CubeSat community faced over the past few years was the lack of rides into space. Students were building CubeSats but they just sat on the shelf until an opportunity arose. In some cases, these opportunities never developed and so the CubeSat never made it to orbit. The ELaNa initiative is changing this by providing sustainable launch opportunities for educational CubeSats. Across America, these CubeSats are currently being built by students in high school all the way through graduate school. Now students know that if they build their CubeSat, submit their proposal and are selected for an ELaNa mission, they will have the opportunity to fly their satellite. ELaNa missions are the first educational cargo to be carried on expendable launch vehicles (ELY) for NASA's Launch Services Program (LSP). The first ELaNa CubeSats were slated to begin their journey to orbit in February 2011 with NASA's Glory mission. Due to an anomaly with the launch vehicle, ELaNa II and Glory failed to reach orbit. This first ELaNa mission was comprised of three IU CubeSats built by students at Montana State University (Explorer Prime Flight 1), the University of Colorado (HERMES), and Kentucky Space, a consortium of state universities (KySat). The interface between the launch vehicle and the CubeSat, the Poly\n\nSmallsats, Cubesats and Scientific Exploration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStofan, E. R.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSmallsats (including Cubesats) have taken off in the aerospace research community - moving beyond simple tools for undergraduate and graduate students and into the mainstream of science research. Cubesats started the \"smallsat\" trend back in the late 1990's early 2000's, with the first Cubesats launching in 2003. NASA anticipates a number of future benefits from small satellite missions, including lower costs, more rapid development, higher risk tolerance, and lower barriers to entry for universities and small businesses. The Agency's Space Technology Mission Directorate is currently addressing technology gaps in small satellite platforms, while the Science Mission Directorate pursues miniaturization of science instruments. Launch opportunities are managed through the Cubesat Launch Initiative, and the Agency manages these projects as sub-orbital payloads with little program overhead. In this session we bring together scientists and technologists to discuss the current state of the smallsat field. We explore ideas for new investments, new instruments, or new applications that NASA should be investing in to expand the utility of smallsats. We discuss the status of a NASA-directed NRC study on the utility of small satellites. Looking to the future, what does NASA need to invest in now, to enable high impact (\"decadal survey\" level) science with smallsats? How do we push the envelope? We anticipate smallsats will contribute significantly to a more robust exploration and science program for NASA and the country.\n\nELaNa - Educational Launch of Nanosatellite Providing Routine RideShare Opportunities\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSkrobot, Garrett Lee; Coelho, Roland\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSince the creation of the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative (NCSLI), the need for CubeSat rideshares has dramatically increased. After only three releases of the initiative, a total of 66 CubeSats now await launch opportunities. So, how is this challenge being resolved? NASA's Launch Services Program (LSP) has studied how to integrate PPODs on Athena, Atlas V, and Delta IV launch vehicles and has been instrumental in developing several carrier systems to support CubeSats as rideshares on NASA missions. In support of the first two ELaNa missions the Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD) was adapted for use on a Taurus XL (ELaNa I) and a Delta n (ELaNa III). Four P-PODs, which contained a total eight CubeSats, were used on these first ELaNa missions. Next up is ELaNa VI, which will launch on an Atlas V in August 2012. The four ELaNa VI CubeSats, in three P-PODs, are awaiting launch, having been integrated in the NPSCuLite. To increase rideshare capabilities, the Launch Services Program (LSP) is working to integrate P-PODs on Falcon 9 missions. The proposed Falcon 9 manifest will provide greater opportunities for the CubeSat community. For years, the standard CubeSat size was 1 U to 3U. As the desire to include more science in each cube grows, so does the standard CubeSat size. No longer is a 1 U, 1.5U, 2U or 3U CubeSat the only option available; the new CubeSat standard will include 6U and possibly even 12U. With each increase in CubeSat size, the CubeSat community is pushing the capability of the current P-POD design. Not only is the carrier system affected, but integration to the Launch Vehicle is also a concern. The development of a system to accommodate not only the 3U P-POD but also carriers for larger CubeSats is ongoing. LSP considers payloads in the lkg to 180 kg range rideshare or small/secondary payloads. As new and emerging small payloads are developed, rideshare opportunities and carrier systems need to be identified and secured. The development of a\n\nCSUNSat-1 CubeSat â ELaNa XVII\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-04-04\n\nThe primary mission of CSUNSat1 is to space test an innovative low temperature capable energy storage system developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, raising its TRL level to 7 from 4 to 5. The success of this energy storage system will enable future missions, especially those in deep space to do more science while requiring less energy, mass and volume. This CubeSat was designed, built, programmed, and tested by a team of over 70 engineering and computer science students at CSUN.Â The primary source of funding for CSUNSat1 comes from NASAâs Smallest Technology Partnership program. Launched by NASAâs CubeSat Launch Initiative on the NET April 18, 2017 ELaNa XVII mission on the seventh Orbital-ATK Cygnus Commercial Resupply Services (OA-7) to the International Space Station and deployed on tbd.\n\nCubeSat Material Limits For Design for Demise\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKelley, R. L.; Jarkey, D. R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe CubeSat form factor of nano-satellite (a satellite with a mass between one and ten kilograms) has grown in popularity due to their ease of construction and low development and launch costs. In particular, their use as student led payload design projects has increased due to the growing number of launch opportunities. CubeSats are often deployed as secondary or tertiary payloads on most US launch vehicles or they may be deployed from the ISS. The focus of this study will be on CubeSats launched from the ISS. From a space safety standpoint, the development and deployment processes for CubeSats differ significantly from that of most satellites. For large satellites, extensive design reviews and documentation are completed, including assessing requirements associated with reentry survivability. Typical CubeSat missions selected for ISS deployment have a less rigorous review process that may not evaluate aspects beyond overall design feasibility. CubeSat design teams often do not have the resources to ensure their design is compliant with reentry risk requirements. A study was conducted to examine methods to easily identify the maximum amount of a given material that can be used in the construction of a CubeSats without posing harm to persons on the ground. The results demonstrate that there is not a general equation or relationship that can be used for all materials; instead a limiting value must be defined for each unique material. In addition, the specific limits found for a number of generic materials that have been previously used as benchmarking materials for reentry survivability analysis tool comparison will be discussed.\n\nCubeSat Material Limits for Design for Demise\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKelley, R.

J.; Vavrin, A. B.; Manis, A. P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLong-term models, such as NASA's LEGEND (LEO (Low-Earth Orbit)-to-GEO (Geosynchrous Earth Orbit) Environment Debris) model, are used to make predictions about how space activities will affect the long-term evolution of the debris environment. Part of this process is to predict how spacecraft and rocket bodies will be launched and left in the environment in the future. This has usually been accomplished by repeating past launch history to simulate future launches. It was partially upon the basis of the results of such models that both national and international orbital debris mitigation guidelines - especially the \"25-year rule\" for post-mission disposal - were determined. The proliferation of Cubesat launches in recent years, however, has raised concerns that we are seeing a fundamental shift in how humans launch satellites into space that may alter the assumptions upon which our current mitigation guidelines are based. The large number of Cubesats, and their short lifetime and general inability to perform collision avoidance, potentially makes them an important new source of debris. The NASA Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO) has conducted a series of LEGEND computations to investigate the long-term effects of adding Cubesats to the environment. Several possible future scenarios were simulated to investigate the effects of the size of future Cubesat launches and the efficiency of post-mission disposal on the proliferation of catastrophic collisions over the next 200 years. These results are compared to a baseline \"business-as-usual\" scenario where launches are assumed to continue as in the past without major Cubesat deployments. Using these results, we make observations about the continued use of the 25-year rule and the importance of the universal application of post-mission disposal. We also discuss how the proliferation of Cubesats may affect satellite traffic at lower altitudes.\n\nA Cubesat Asteroid Mission: Propulsion Trade-offs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLandis, Geoffrey A.; Oleson, Steven R.; McGuire, Melissa L.; Bur, Michael J.; Burke, Laura M.; Fittje, James E.; Kohout, Lisa L.; Fincannon, James; Packard, Thomas W.; Martini, Michael C.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA conceptual design was performed for a 6-U cubesat for a technology demonstration to be launched on the NASA Space Launch System (SLS) test launch EM-1, to be launched into a free-return translunar trajectory. The mission purpose was to demonstrate use of electric propulsion systems on a small satellite platform. The candidate objective chosen was a mission to visit a Near-Earth asteroid. Both asteroid fly-by and asteroid rendezvous missions were analyzed. Propulsion systems analyzed included cold-gas thruster systems, Hall and ion thrusters, incorporating either Xenon or Iodine propellant, and an electrospray thruster. The mission takes advantage of the ability of the SLS launch to place it into an initial trajectory of C3=0.\n\nCAPE-2 Cubesat - ELaNa IV\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2016-07-25\n\nCAPE-2: Cajun Advanced Picosatellite Experiment â ELaNa IV CAPE-2 was developed by students from the University of Louisiana Lafayette to engage, inspire and educate K-12 students to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. The secondary focus is the technology demonstration of deployed solar panels to support the following payloads: text to speech, voice repeater, tweeting, email, file transfer and data collection from buoys. Launched by NASAâs CubeSat Launch Initiative on the ELaNa IV mission as an auxiliary payload aboard the U.S. Air Force-led Operationally Responsive Space (ORS-3) Mission on November 19, 2013.\n\nMassively Clustered CubeSats NCPS Demo Mission\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRobertson, Glen A.; Young, David; Kim, Tony; Houts, Mike\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTechnologies under development for the proposed Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (NCPS) will require an un-crewed demonstration mission before they can be flight qualified over distances and time frames representative of a crewed Mars mission. In this paper, we describe a Massively Clustered CubeSats platform, possibly comprising hundreds of CubeSats, as the main payload of the NCPS demo mission. This platform would enable a mechanism for cost savings for the demo mission through shared support between NASA and other government agencies as well as leveraged commercial aerospace and academic community involvement. We believe a Massively Clustered CubeSats platform should be an obvious first choice for the NCPS demo mission when one considers that cost and risk of the payload can be spread across many CubeSat customers and that the NCPS demo mission can capitalize on using CubeSats developed by others for its own instrumentation needs. Moreover, a demo mission of the NCPS offers an unprecedented opportunity to invigorate the public on a global scale through direct individual participation coordinated through a web-based collaboration engine. The platform we describe would be capable of delivering CubeSats at various locations along a trajectory toward the primary mission destination, in this case Mars, permitting a variety of potential CubeSat-specific missions. Cameras on various CubeSats can also be used to provide multiple views of the space environment and the NCPS vehicle for video monitoring as well as allow the public to \"ride along\" as virtual passengers on the mission. This collaborative approach could even initiate a brand new Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) program for launching student developed CubeSat payloads beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) on future deep space technology qualification missions.

The mission addresses a fundamental science question that is central to our understanding of the structure, origin, and evolution of the universe by potentially lending insight into both the high-energy background radiation and into the evolution of primordial galaxies.Â Launched by NASAâs CubeSat Launch Initiative NET April 18, 2017 ELaNa XVII mission on the seventh Orbital-ATK Cygnus Commercial Resupply Services (OA-7) to the International Space Station and deployed on tbd.\n\nIntegration and Environmental Qualification Testing of Spacecraft Structures in Support of the Naval Postgraduate School CubeSat Launcher Program\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-06-01\n\n2 3.

A standard CubeSat measures about 10 cm square, and is referred to as a 1-unit (1U) CubeSat. A single NLAS provides the capability to deploy 24U of CubeSats. The system is designed to accommodate satellites measuring 1U, 1.5U, 2U, 3U and 6U sizes for deployment into orbit. The NLAS may be configured for use on different launch vehicles. The system also enables flight demonstrations of new technologies in the space environment.\n\nCubeSat Integration into the Space Situational Awareness Architecture\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorris, K.; Wolfson, M.; Brown, J.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nLockheed Martin Space Systems Company has recently been involved in developing GEO Space Situational Awareness architectures, which allows insights into how cubesats can augment the current national systems. One hole that was identified in the current architecture is the need for timelier metric track observations to aid in the chain of custody. Obtaining observations of objects at GEO can be supported by CubeSats. These types of small satellites are increasing being built and flown by government agencies like NASA and SMDC. CubeSats are generally mass and power constrained allowing for only small payloads that cannot typically mimic traditional flight capability. CubeSats do not have a high reliability and care must be taken when choosing mission orbits to prevent creating more debris. However, due to the low costs, short development timelines, and available hardware, CubeSats can supply very valuable benefits to these complex missions, affordably. For example, utilizing CubeSats for advanced focal plane demonstrations to support technology insertion into the next generation situational awareness sensors can help to lower risks before the complex sensors are developed. CubeSats can augment the planned ground and space based assets by creating larger constellations with more access to areas of interest. To aid in maintaining custody of objects, a CubeSat constellation at 500 km above GEO would provide increased point of light tracking that can augment the ground SSA assets. Key features of the Cubesat include a small visible camera looking along the GEO belt, a small propulsion system that allows phasing between CubeSats, and an image processor to reduce the data sent to the ground. An elegant communications network will also be used to provide commands to and data from multiple CubeSats. Additional CubeSats can be deployed on GSO launches or through ride shares to GEO, replenishing or adding to the constellation with each launch.

The 2016 NRC Report âAchieving Science with CubeSatsâ indicates that between 2013 and 2018 NASA and NSF sponsored 104 CubeSats. Of those, only one is devoted to astrophysics: HaloSat (PI: P. Kaaret), a 6U CubeSat with an X-ray payload to study the hot galactic halo.Despite this paucity of missions, CubeSats have a lot of potential for astrophysics. To assess the science landscape that a CubeSat astrophysics mission may occupy, we consider the following parameters:1-Wavelength: CubeSats are not competitive in the visible, unless the application (e.g. high precision photometry) is difficult to do from the ground. Thermal IR science is limited by the lack of low-power miniaturized cryocoolers and by the large number of infrared astrophysical missions launched or planned. In the UV, advances in Î´-doping processes result in larger sensitivity with smaller apertures. Commercial X-ray detectors also allow for competitive science.2-Survey vs. Pointed observations: All-sky surveys have been done at most wavelengths from X-rays to Far-IR and CubeSats will not be able to compete in sensitivity with them. CubeSat science should then center on specific objects or object classes. Due to poor attitude control, unresolved photometry is scientifically more promising that extended imaging.3-Single-epoch vs. time domain: CubeSat apertures cannot compete in sensitivity with big satellites when doing single-epoch observations. However, time-domain astrophysics is an area in which CubeSats can provide very valuable science return.Technologically, CubeSat astrophysics is limited by:1-Lack of large apertures: The largest aperture CubeSat launched is ~10 cm, although deployable apertures as large as 20 cm could be fitted to 6U buses.2-Poor attitude control: State-of-the-art systems have demonstrated jitter of ~10â on timescales of seconds. Jitter imposes limits on image quality and, coupled with detector errors\n\nNear Earth Network (NEN) CubeSat Communications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchaire, Scott\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe NASA Near Earth Network (NEN) consists of globally distributed tracking stations, including NASA, commercial, and partner ground stations, that are strategically located to maximize the coverage provided to a variety of orbital and suborbital missions, including those in LEO (Low Earth Orbit), GEO (Geosynchronous Earth Orbit), HEO (Highly Elliptical Orbit), lunar and L1-L2 orbits. The NEN's future mission set includes and will continue to include CubeSat missions. The first NEN-supported CubeSat mission will be the Cubesat Proximity Operations Demonstration (CPOD) launching into LEO in 2017. The majority of the CubeSat missions destined to fly on EM-1, launching in late 2018, many in a lunar orbit, will communicate with ground-based stations via X-band and will utilize the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)-developed IRIS (Satellite Communication for Air Traffic Management) radio. The NEN recognizes the important role CubeSats are beginning to play in carrying out NASAs mission and is therefore investigating the modifications needed to provide IRIS radio compatibility. With modification, the NEN could potentially expand support to the EM-1 (Exploration Mission-1) lunar CubeSats. The NEN could begin providing significant coverage to lunar CubeSat missions utilizing three to four of the NEN's mid-latitude sites. This coverage would supplement coverage provided by the JPL Deep Space Network (DSN). The NEN, with smaller apertures than DSN, provides the benefit of a larger beamwidth that could be beneficial in the event of uncertain ephemeris data. In order to realize these benefits the NEN would need to upgrade stations targeted based on coverage ability and current configuration ease of upgrade, to ensure compatibility with the IRIS radio. In addition, the NEN is working with CubeSat radio developers to ensure NEN compatibility with alternative CubeSat radios for Lunar and L1-L2 CubeSats. The NEN has provided NEN compatibility requirements to several radio\n\nOPTEC: A Cubesat for Solar Cell Calibration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLandis, Geoffrey; Hepp, Aloysius; Arutyunov, Dennis; White, Kelsey; Witsberger, Paul\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA new type of small spacecraft, the cubesat, has introduced a new concept for extremely small, low-cost missions into space. Cubesats are designed to be launched as secondary payloads on other missions, and are made up of unit elements (U) of size 10 cm by 10 cm by 10 cm, with a nominal mass of no more than 1.33 kg per U. We have designed a cubesat, OPTEC (Orbital Photovoltaic Testbed Cubesat) as a low-cost testbed to demonstrate, calibrate, and test solar cell technologies in space. Size of the cubesat is 2U (10x10x20cm, and the mass 2.66 kg. The cubesat deploys from the International Space Station into Low Earth Orbit at an altitude of about 420 km. Up to two 4x8cm test solar panels can be flown, with full I-V curves and temperature measurements taken.\n\nAchieving Science with CubeSats: Thinking Inside the Box\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZurbuchen, Thomas H.; Lal, Bhavya\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe present the results of a study conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The study focused on the scientific potential and technological promise of CubeSats. We will first review the growth of the CubeSat platform from an education-focused technology toward a platform of importance for technology development, science, and commercial use, both in the United States and internationally. The use has especially exploded in recent years. For example, of the over 400 CubeSats launched since 2000, more than 80% of all science-focused ones have been launched just in the past four years. Similarly, more than 80% of peer-reviewed papers describing new science based on CubeSat data have been published in the past five years.We will then assess the technological and science promise of CubeSats across space science disciplines, and discuss a subset of priority science goals that can be achieved given the current state of CubeSat capabilities. Many of these goals address targeted science, often in coordination with other spacecraft, or by using sacrificial or high-risk orbits that lead to the demise of the satellite after critical data have been collected. Other goals relate to the use of CubeSats as constellations or swarms, deploying tens to hundreds of CubeSats that function as one distributed array of measurements.Finally, we will summarize our conclusions and recommendations from this study; especially those focused on nearterm investment that could improve the capabilities of CubeSats toward increased science and technological return and enable the science communitiesâ use of CubeSats.\n\nAchieving Science with CubeSats: Thinking Inside the Box\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLal, B.; Zurbuchen, T.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn this paper, we present a study conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

The mission calls for sending the cubesats on impact trajectories to strongly magnetic regions on the surface, and transmitting measurements in real-time to a nearby spacecraft, or directly to the Earth, up until milliseconds before impact. The cubesats and their instruments are partly based on the NSF-funded CINEMA cubesat now in Earth orbit. Two methods of reaching the Moon as a secondary payload are discussed: 1) After launching into geostationary transfer orbit with a communication satellite, a small mother-ship travels into lunar orbit and releases the cubesats on impact trajectories, and 2) The cubesats travel to the Moon using their own propulsion after release into geosynchronous orbit. This latter version would also enable other near-Earth missions, such as constellations for studying magnetospheric processes, and observations of close-approaching asteroids.\n\nEducational Pico-Satellite Project CUBESAT - University of Tokyo's CUBESAT XI and its Operation Plan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTsuda, Y.; Sako, N.; Eishima, T.; Ito, T.; Arikawa, Y.; Miyamura, N.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nUniversity of Tokyo ISSL (Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory) has been developing a pico-satellite called \"CubeSat\" as an international joint program. In CubeSat project, 10cm cubic satellites have been developed by several universities and launched to the low-earth orbit altogether by Russian rocket \"Dnepr\". ISSL has developed \"XI\" series ([sai]: X-factor Investigator) satellites, and the flight model is already fabricated and ready for delivery. The mission of XI satellite is the on-orbit technology demonstration of the ultra-small satellite bus system with an extensive use of commercial-off-the-shelf components. XI transmits the Morse beacon and FM packet telemetry which provides the health data of the satellite. Additionally, XI has a CMOS camera which provides 15,000 pixels panchromatic images as an advanced mission. Ground operation is one of the key issues for CubeSats. Now we are promoting international ground station network in which several universities' ground stations connected by internet collaboratively operate university-built small satellites, which enlarges the link opportunity. Collaboration with amateur HAM engineers is also indispensable for search for the satellite or get beacon signal to estimate the satellite orbit. We are now developing operation concept based on these ideas. As the launch is scheduled in this fall, the operation plan will be fixed at the time of this conference. In this presentation the final design of ISSL's CubeSat XI and operation plan will be presented.\n\nCubesats: Cost-effective science and technology platforms for emerging and developing nations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWoellert, Kirk; Ehrenfreund, Pascale; Ricco, Antonio J.; Hertzfeld, Henry\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThe development, operation, and analysis of data from cubesats can promote science education and spur technology utilization in emerging and developing nations. This platform offers uniquely low construction and launch costs together with a comparative ubiquity of launch providers; factors that have led more than 80 universities and several emerging nations to develop programs in this field. Their small size and weight enables cubesats to âpiggybackâ on rocket launches and accompany orbiters travelling to Moon and Mars. It is envisaged that constellations of cubesats will be used for larger science missions. We present a brief history, technology overview, and summary of applications in science and industry for these small satellites. Cubesat technical success stories are offered along with a summary of pitfalls and challenges encountered in both developed and emerging nations. A discussion of economic and public policy issues aims to facilitate the decision-making process for those considering utilization of this unique technology.\n\nNPS Cubesat Launcher-Lite Sequencer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-06-01\n\nAND SUBTITLE NPS Cubesat Launcher-Lite Sequencer 6.

It provides recommendations for a future CubeSat bus standard. The survey is based on a literature study and a questionnaire representing 60 launched CubeSats and 44 to be launched CubeSats. It is found that the bus interfaces are not the main driver for mission failures. However, it is concluded that the Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) data bus, as implemented in a great majority of the CubeSats, caused some catastrophic satellite failures and a vast amount of bus lockups. The power distribution may lead to catastrophic failures if the power lines are not protected against overcurrent. A connector and wiring standard widely implemented in CubeSats is based on the PC/104 standard. Most participants find the 104 pin connector of this standard too large. For a future CubeSat bus interface standard, it is recommended to implement a reliable data bus, a power distribution with overcurrent protection and a wiring harness with smaller connectors compared with PC/104.\n\nRainCube 6U CubeSat\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2018-05-17\n\nThe RainCube 6U CubeSat with fully-deployed antenna.

These satellites have moved from an educational tool to teach students about engineering challenges associated with satellite design, to systems that are conducting cutting edge earth, space and solar science. Early variants of the CubeSat had limited functionality and lacked sophisticated attitude control, deployable solar arrays and propulsion. This is no longer the case and as CubeSats mature, such systems are becoming commercially available. The result is a small satellite with sufficient power and pointing capabilities to support a high rate communication system. Communications systems have matured along with other CubeSat subsystems. Originally developed from amateur radio systems, CubeSats have generally operated in the VHF and UHF bands at data rates below 10 kbps (kilobits per second). More recently higher rate UHF systems have been developed, however these systems require a large collecting area on the ground to close the communications link at 3 Mbps (megabits per second). Efforts to develop systems that operate with similar throughput at S-Band (2-4 GHz (gigaherz)) and C-Band (4-8 GHz (gigaherz)) have also recently evolved. In this paper we outline an effort to develop a high rate CubeSat communication system that is compatible with the NASA Near Earth Network and can be accommodated by a CubeSat. The system will include a 200 kbps (kilobits per second) S-Band receiver and a 12.5 Mbps (megabits per second).X-Band transmitter. This paper will focus on our design approach and initial results associated with the 12.5 Mbps (megabits per second) X-band transmitter.\n\nPre- to Post- CubeSats\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCutler, J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCubeSats sprung from a formative picosatellite effort at a university in the heart of Silicon Valley, took root in a university-led university environment, and have grown into complex-shaped explorers in both near and soon-to-be deep space. Private citizens, businesses, government are building and launching a variety of science, technology demonstration, and service missions. A new generation of space explorers is gaining first hand experience in space missions at all educational levels. There is new life and new energy in the space program. However, space is still difficult. The environment is harsh. Funding is sparse. This talk explores this history and the future of CubeSats from the context of a university-centric laboratory that emphasizes teaching, research, and entrepreneurial impact. It will explore the following questions: What sparked the CubeSat innovation? What are longer lasting lessons of this community? Where are places we can go next? What does it take to get there? The talk will draw on lessons learned from building over six on-orbit CubeSat missions and training hundreds of space engineers.\n\nA Cubesat to Image Comet Wirtanen at its 2018 Close Approach?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDunham, David W.; Stakkestad, Kjell; Hardgrove, Craig; Vedder, Peter W.; Gaylor, David; Kidd, John; Hergenrother, Carl W.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn Dec. 2018, Comet Wirtanen will pass 0.077 AU from Earth, the best opportunity for a fly by of an active comet on a low-energy orbit in the next 40 years. In 2013, the late Robert Farquhar presented a paper, \"A Unique Multi-Comet Mission Opportunity for China in 2018\" [1]. He used a 1.4-year-Earth-return orbit with launch C3 <3 km^2/s^2 that, after flying by Wirtanen, would use an Earth swingby to fly by SW3C in 2022. While at the 2013 conference, Dr. Farquhar visited the China National Space Administration, which said that all of their funds were committed to their lunar program, precluding a new mission. Other agencies Farquhar approached had similar views.NASA announced its SIMPLEx opportunity in 2014 for cubesats deployed from the second stage of the 1st SLS mission (EM-1) to the Moon. We are on the Arizona State Univ. team that is developing the Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map) cubesat selected for EM-1. LunaH-Map will use an iodine solar electric propulsion system by Busek (Natick, MA) to enter an elliptical lunar orbit with periselene over the lunar south pole. The 1st launch date for EM-1 was in Dec. 2017, but in May 2016, NASA changed it to October 7, 2018. That's 2 months before Wirtanen's closest approach, so we looked into sending a cubesat with LunaH-Map's propulsion system to Wirtanen. The lunar swingby that might send a cubesat to Wirtanen would occur on Oct. 12 when the Earth C3 to reach Wirtanen is 2.25 km^2/s^2. We tried realistic simulations, finding that a LunaH-Map-like cubesat could not reach Wirtanen, but a spacecraft with 4 times the thrust could. Another cubesat with a more capable propulsion system might reach Wirtanen from EM-1. EM-1 can deploy 13 cubesats, all taken except for 3 for foreign partners. If EM-1 launches a month earlier, then a LunaH-Map-like cubesat could reach Wirtanen; the lowest C3 is 0.95 km^2/s^2 with an Earth departure on Sept. 5. If there is another launch with the possibility of carrying a cubesat then, the\n\nPropulsion for CubeSats\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLemmer, Kristina\n\n2017-05-01\n\nAt present, very few CubeSats have flown in space featuring propulsion systems. Of those that have, the literature is scattered, published in a variety of formats (conference proceedings, contractor websites, technical notes, and journal articles), and often not available for public release. This paper seeks to collect the relevant publically releasable information in one location. To date, only two missions have featured propulsion systems as part of the technology demonstration. The IMPACT mission from the Aerospace Corporation launched several electrospray thrusters from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and BricSAT-P from the United States Naval Academy had four micro-Cathode Arc Thrusters from George Washington University. Other than these two missions, propulsion on CubeSats has been used only for attitude control and reaction wheel desaturation via cold gas propulsion systems. As the desired capability of CubeSats increases, and more complex missions are planned, propulsion is required to accomplish the science and engineering objectives. This survey includes propulsion systems that have been designed specifically for the CubeSat platform and systems that fit within CubeSat constraints but were developed for other platforms. Throughout the survey, discussion of flight heritage and results of the mission are included where publicly released information and data have been made available. Major categories of propulsion systems that are in this survey are solar sails, cold gas propulsion, electric propulsion, and chemical propulsion systems. Only systems that have been tested in a laboratory or with some flight history are included.\n\nMiniaturized Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer for CubeSat Atmospheric Measurements\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRodriguez, M.; Paschalidis, N.; Jones, S.; Sittler, E.; Chornay, D.; Uribe, P.; Cameron, T.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo increase the number of single point in-situ measurements of thermosphere and exosphere ion and neutral composition and density, miniaturized instrumentation is in high demand to take advantage of the increasing platform opportunities available in the smallsat/cubesat industry. The INMS (Ion-Neutral Mass Spectrometer) addresses this need by providing simultaneous measurements of both the neutral and ion environment, essentially providing two instruments in one compact model. The 1.3U volume, 570 gram, 1.8W nominal power INMS instrument makes implementation into cubesat designs (3U and above) practical and feasible. With high dynamic range (0.1-500eV), mass dynamic range of 1-40amu, sharp time resolution (0.1s), and mass resolution of MdM16, the INMS instrument addresses the atmospheric science needs that otherwise would have required larger more expensive instrumentation. INMS-v1 (version 1) launched on Exocube (CalPoly 3U cubesat) in 2015 and INMS-v2 (version 2) is scheduled to launch on Dellingr (GSFC 6U cubesat) in 2017. New versions of INMS are currently being developed to increase and add measurement capabilities, while maintaining its smallsat/cubesat form.\n\nEffects of CubeSat Deployments in Low-Earth Orbit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMatney, Mark; Vavrin, Andrew; Manis, Alyssa\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLong-term models, such as NASA's LEGEND (LEO-to- GEO Environment Debris) model, are used to make predictions about how space activities will affect the manner in which the debris environment evolves over time. Part of this process predicts how spacecraft and rocket bodies will be launched and remain in the future environment. This has usually been accomplished by repeating past launch history to simulate future launches. The NASA Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO) has conducted a series of LEGEND computations to investigate the long-term effects of adding CubeSats to the environment. These results are compared to a baseline \"business-as-usual\" scenario where launches are assumed to continue as in the past without major CubeSat deployments. Using these results, we make observations about the continued use of the 25-year rule and the importance of the universal application of postmission disposal.\n\nA survey and assessment of the capabilities of Cubesats for Earth observation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSelva, Daniel; Krejci, David\n\n2012-05-01\n\nIn less than a decade, Cubesats have evolved from purely educational tools to a standard platform for technology demonstration and scientific instrumentation. The use of COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components and the ongoing miniaturization of several technologies have already led to scattered instances of missions with promising scientific value. Furthermore, advantages in terms of development cost and development time with respect to larger satellites, as well as the possibility of launching several dozens of Cubesats with a single rocket launch, have brought forth the potential for radically new mission architectures consisting of very large constellations or clusters of Cubesats. These architectures promise to combine the temporal resolution of GEO missions with the spatial resolution of LEO missions, thus breaking a traditional trade-off in Earth observation mission design. This paper assesses the current capabilities of Cubesats with respect to potential employment in Earth observation missions. A thorough review of Cubesat bus technology capabilities is performed, identifying potential limitations and their implications on 17 different Earth observation payload technologies. These results are matched to an exhaustive review of scientific requirements in the field of Earth observation, assessing the possibilities of Cubesats to cope with the requirements set for each one of 21 measurement categories. Based on this review, several Earth observation measurements are identified that can potentially be compatible with the current state-of-the-art of Cubesat technology although some of them have actually never been addressed by any Cubesat mission. Simultaneously, other measurements are identified which are unlikely to be performed by Cubesats in the next few years due to insuperable constraints. Ultimately, this paper is intended to supply a box of ideas for universities to design future Cubesat missions with high scientific payoff.\n\nTemporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems (TEMPEST) CubeSat Constellation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReising, S.

S.; Berg, G.; Koch, T.; Boukabara, S. A.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nTEMPEST addresses key science needs related to cloud and precipitation processes using a constellation of five CubeSats with identical five-frequency millimeter-wave radiometers spaced 5-10 minutes apart in orbit. The deployment of CubeSat constellations on satellite launches of opportunity allows Earth system observations to be accomplished with greater robustness, shorter repeat times and at a small fraction of the cost of typical Earth Science missions. The current suite of Earth-observing satellites is capable of measuring precipitation parameters using radar or radiometric observations. However, these low Earth-orbiting satellites provide only a snapshot of each storm, due to their repeat-pass times of many hours to days. With typical convective events lasting 1-2 hours, it is highly unlikely that the time evolution of clouds through the onset of precipitation will be observed with current assets. The TEMPEST CubeSat constellation directly observes the time evolution of clouds and identifies changes in time to detect the moment of the onset of precipitation. The TEMPEST millimeter-wave radiometers penetrate into the cloud to directly observe changes as the cloud begins to precipitate or ice accumulates inside the storm. The evolution of ice formation in clouds is important for climate prediction because it largely drives Earth's radiation budget. TEMPEST improves understanding of cloud processes and helps to constrain one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate models. TEMPEST provides observations at five millimeter-wave frequencies from 90 to 183 GHz using a single compact instrument that is well suited for a 6U CubeSat architecture and fits well within the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) capabilities. Five identical CubeSats deployed in the same orbital plane with 5-10 minute spacing at 390-450 km altitude and 50-65 degree inclination capture 3 million observations of precipitation, including 100,000 deep convective events in a one\n\nExploring Our Solar System with CubeSats and NanoSats\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFreeman, Anthony; Norton, Charles\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is NASA's lead center for robotic exploration of our solar system. We are known for our large, flagship missions, such as Voyager, which gave humanity its first close look at Jupiter and Saturn; and the Mars Rovers, which have excited millions worldwide with their daring landing exploits. Less familiar to those outside NASA may be our role in developing the Kepler mission, which has discovered more than 2000 planets around other stars; or the recently launched Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, one of many JPL Earth Science missions. A recent JPL initiative has emphasized low cost missions that use rapidly evolving technology developed for CubeSats and NanoSat s to explore our solar system. Costs are significantly lower (by one or two orders of magnitude) than for conventional JPL missions, and development time is also significantly shorter. At present 21 such CubeSat flight projects are under way at the laboratory with various partners : some in flight, some in development, some in advanced formulation. Four are planned as deep space missions. To succeed in exploring deep space CubeSat/NanoSat missions have to address several challenges: the more severe radiation environment, communications and navigation at a distance, propulsion, and packaging of instruments that can return valuable science into a compact volume/mass envelope. Instrument technologies, including cameras, magnetometers, spectrometers, radiometers, and even radars are undergoing miniaturization to fit on these smaller platforms. Other key technologies are being matured for smallsats and NanoSats in deep space, including micro -electric propulsion, compact radio (and optical) communications, and onboard data reduction. This paper will describe missions that utilize these developments including the first two deep space CubeSats (INSPIRE), planned for launch in 2017; the first pair of CubeSats to be sent to another planet (MARCO), manifested with the In\n\nSize Contrast for Mars CubeSat\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2015-06-12\n\nThe full-scale mock-up of NASA's MarCO CubeSat held by Farah Alibay, a systems engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is dwarfed by the one-half-scale model of NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter behind her. MarCO, short for Mars Cube One, is the first interplanetary use of CubeSat technologies for small spacecraft. JPL is preparing two MarCO twins for launch in March 2016. They will ride along on an Atlas V launch vehicle lifting off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, with NASA's next Mars lander, InSight. MarCO is a technology demonstration aspect of the InSight mission. The mock-up in the photo is in a configuration to show the deployed position of components that correspond to MarCO's two solar panels and two antennas. During launch, those components will be stowed for a total vehicle size of about 14.4 inches (36.6 centimeters) by 9.5 inches (24.3 centimeters) by 4.6 inches (11.8 centimeters). After launch, the two MarCO CubeSats and InSight will be navigated separately to Mars. The MarCO twins will fly past the planet in September 2016 just as InSight is descending through the atmosphere and landing on the surface. MarCO is a technology demonstration to relay communications from InSight to Earth during InSight's descent and landing. InSight communications during that critical period will also be recorded by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for delayed transmission to Earth.

Smaller than long-term (5+ year life expectancy) satellites, these pico-satellites are comparatively cheap, small (10x10x10 cm), and are very versatile. Universities world-wide are using CubeSats to conduct a variety of experiments in space without the need for a large experimental platform. Today CubeSats are considered to be one of the most effective ways to send a small payload into space and has attracted the attention of many educational and non-profit organizations. As this pico-satellite model continues to gain penetration into the satellite build and launch industry, it is expected that more governmental, educational, and commercial interests will emerge. As an example, more of the space-related items of high interest to the National Science Foundation may be tackled with a CubeSat platform resulting in lower life cycle costs than traditional satellite options. NASA LSP, in cooperation with the Florida Institute of Technology, has initiated a feasibility study to investigate the technical aspects of measuring and transferring vibration, acceleration, temperature, and video data from a CubeSat to NASA Hanger AE on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) a.k.a. Kennedy Space Center (KSC). This report provides a technical feasibility analysis to determine whether-or-not a specific set of NASA/LSP requirements can be accomplished. Our approach has been to provide a \"notional\" component layout to determine the feasibility of the NASA/LSP stakeholder requirements. The notional layout is used to consider component level technical issues such as size, weight, & power (SWaP), bandwidth, and other critical technical parameters. Even though the notional components may satisfy the stated requirements and thereby demonstrate feasibility, the notional layout is NOT considered a design since no component optimization and design trade-off analysis has taken place. This activity should be accomplished in an appropriate\n\nSolar Torque Management for the Near Earth Asteroid Scout CubeSat Using Center of Mass Position Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOrphee, Juan; Heaton, Andrew; Diedrich, Ben; Stiltner, Brandon C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA novel mechanism, the Active Mass Translator (AMT), has been developed for the NASA Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout mission to autonomously manage the spacecraft momentum. The NEA Scout CubeSat will launch as a secondary payload onboard Exploration Mission 1 of the Space Launch System. To accomplish its mission, the CubeSat will be propelled by an 86 square-meter solar sail during its two-year journey to reach asteroid 1991VG. NEA Scout's primary attitude control system uses reaction wheels for holding attitude and performing slew maneuvers, while a cold gas reaction control system performs the initial detumble and early trajectory correction maneuvers. The AMT control system requirements, feedback architecture, and control performance will be presented. The AMT reduces the amount of reaction control propellant needed for momentum management and allows for smaller capacity reaction wheels suitable for the limited 6U spacecraft volume. The reduced spacecraft mass allows higher in-space solar sail acceleration, thus reducing time-of-flight. The reduced time-of-flight opens the range of possible missions, which is limited by the lifetime of typical non-radiation tolerant CubeSat avionics exposed to the deep-space environment.\n\nLEDsats: LEO CubeSats with LEDs for Optical Tracking\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSeitzer, P.; Cutler, J.; Piergentili, F.; Santoni, F.; Arena, L.; Cardona, T.; Cowardin, H.; Lee, C.; Sharma, S.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nWe describe a project to launch 1U CubeSats equipped with Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for optical tracking with ground-based telescopes. Active illumination on the satellites increases tremendously the number of passes where the LEO satellite is visible when the ground-based telescope is in darkness. The restriction that the satellite is in direct Sun is removed, and so tracking can take place all night long rather than just in twilight. The inspiration for this project came from the Japanese CubeSat FITSAT-1 that carried red and green high-powered LED arrays, and was clearly visible from the ground with small telescopes. There are two goals: 1) increase the accuracy and precision of LEO orbits by increasing the number and length of passes that satellite is visible, and 2) minimize the confusion between objects in the case of multiple CubeSats being launched at the same time. Technical issues to be discussed include the power level required for detection by small (20 - 40 cm) ground based telescopes, the optimum flash pattern for astrometry against star fields, and the timing of the flash pattern to millisecond or better accuracy and precision. We propose to deploy two such LEDsats simultaneously from the International Space Station: the first to be built at the University of Michigan, and the second to be built at Sapienza University Rome. One experiment is to see how we can distinguish these two CubeSats shortly after deployment solely from optical tracking, and so the CubeSats will have different flash patterns.\n\nIntegrated Solar Array and Reflectarray Antenna for High Bandwidth Cubesats\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLewis, Dorothy; Agasid, Elwood Floyd; Ardila, David R.; Hunter, Roger C.; Baker, Christopher E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Integrated Solar Array and Reflectarray Antenna (ISARA) mission will demonstrate a reflectarray antenna that increases downlink data rates for CubeSats from the existing baseline rate of 9.6 kilobits per second (kbps) to more than100 megabits per second (Mbps). A secondary payload called the CubeSat Multispectral Observation System (CUMULOS), is an experimental remote sensing payload also being demonstrated on this mission. A launch date for the ISARA spacecraft is currently pending.\n\nLunar and Lagrangian Point L1 L2 CubeSat Communication and Navigation Considerations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchaire, Scott; Wong, Yen F.; Altunc, Serhat; Bussey, George D.; Shelton, Marta; Folta, Dave; Gramling, Cheryl; Celeste, Peter; Anderson, Mike; Perrotto, Trish;\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCubeSats have grown in sophistication to the point that relatively low-cost mission solutions could be undertaken for planetary exploration. There are unique considerations for Lunar and L1L2 CubeSat communication and navigation compared with low earth orbit CubeSats. This paper explores those considerations as they relate to the MoreheadGSFC Lunar IceCube Mission. The Lunar IceCube is a CubeSat mission led by Morehead State University with participation from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, JPL, the Busek Company and Vermont Tech. It will search for surface water ice and other resources from a high inclination lunar orbit. Lunar IceCube is one of a select group of CubeSats designed to explore beyond low-earth orbit that will fly on NASAs Space Launch System (SLS) as secondary payloads for Exploration Mission (EM) 1. Lunar IceCube and the EM-1 CubeSats will lay the groundwork for future lunar and L1L2 CubeSat missions. This paper discusses communication and navigation needs for the Lunar IceCube mission and navigation and radiation tolerance requirements related to lunar and L1L2 orbits. Potential CubeSat radio and antennas for such missions are investigated and compared. Ground station coverage, link analysis, and ground station solutions are also discussed. There are currently modifications in process for the Morehead ground station. Further enhancement of the Morehead ground station and the NASA Near Earth Network (NEN) are being examined. This paper describes how the NEN may support Lunar and L1L2 CubeSats without any enhancements and potential expansion of NEN to better support such missions in the future. The potential NEN enhancements include upgrading current NEN Cortex receiver with Forward Error Correction (FEC) Turbo Code, providing X-band Uplink capability, and adding ranging options. The benefits of ground station enhancements for CubeSats flown on NASA Exploration Missions (EM) are presented. The paper also discusses other initiatives that the NEN is\n\nInSight MARCO Installation Cubesats\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2018-03-17\n\nAt Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, twin communications-relay CubeSats, called Mars Cube One (MarCO) are installed on an Atlas V rocket.

A conceptual design was done for a 6-U cubesat for a technology demonstration to demonstrate use of electric propulsion systems on a small satellite platform. The candidate objective was a mission to be launched on the SLS test launch EM-1 to visit a Near-Earth asteroid. Both asteroid fly-by and asteroid rendezvous missions were analyzed. Propulsion systems analyzed included cold-gas thruster systems, Hall and ion thrusters, incorporating either Xenon or Iodine propellant, and an electrospray thruster. The mission takes advantage of the ability of the SLS launch to place it into an initial trajectory of C3=0. Targeting asteroids that fly close to earth minimizes the propulsion required for fly-by/rendezvous. Due to mass constraints, high specific impulse is required, and volume constraints mean the propellant density was also of great importance to the ability to achieve the required deltaV. This improves the relative usefulness of the electrospray salt, with higher propellant density. In order to minimize high pressure tanks and volatiles, the salt electrospray and iodine ion propulsion systems were the optimum designs for the fly-by and rendezvous missions respectively combined with a thruster gimbal and wheel system For the candidate fly-by mission, with a mission deltaV of about 400 m/s, the mission objectives could be accomplished with a 800s electrospray propulsion system, incorporating a propellant-less cathode and a bellows salt tank. This propulsion system is planned for demonstration on 2015 LEO and 2016 GEO DARPA flights. For the rendezvous mission, at a ?V of 2000 m/s, the mission could be accomplished with a 50W miniature ion propulsion system running iodine propellant. This propulsion system is not yet demonstrated in space. The conceptual design shows that an asteroid mission is possible using a cubesat\n\nKa-Band Parabolic Deployable Antenna (KaPDA) Enabling High Speed Data Communication for CubeSats\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSauder, Jonathan F.; Chahat, Nacer; Hodges, Richard; Thomson, Mark W.; Rahmat-Samii, Yahya\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCubeSats are at a very exciting point as their mission capabilities and launch opportunities are increasing. But as instruments become more advanced and operational distances between CubeSats and earth increase communication data rate becomes a mission-limiting factor. Improving data rate has become critical enough for NASA to sponsor the Cube Quest Centennial Challenge when: one of the key metrics is transmitting as much data as possible from the moon and beyond Currently, many CubeSats communicate on UHF bands and those that have high data rate abilities use S-band or X-band patch antennas. The CubeSat Aneas, which was launched in September 2012, pushed the envelope with a half-meter S-band dish which could achieve 100x the data rate of patch antennas. A half-meter parabolic antenna operating at Ka-band would increase data rates by over 100x that of the AMOS antenM and 10,000 that of X-band patch antennas.\n\nImproved Orbit Determination of LEO CubeSats: Project LEDsat\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCutler, J.; Seitzer, P.; Lee, C. H.; Washabaugh, P.; Sharma, S.; Gitten, R.; Piergentili, F.; Santoni, F.; Cardona, T.; Cialone, G.; Frezza, L.; Gianfermo, A.; Marzioli, P.; Masillo, S.; Pellegrino, A.; Schildknecht, T.; Bedard, D.; Cowardin, H.\n\nProject LEDsat is an international project (USA, Italy, and Canada) designed to improve the identification and orbit determination of CubeSats in low Earth orbit (LEO). The goal is to fly CubeSats with multiple methods of measuring positions on the same spacecraft: GPS, optical tracking, satellite laser ranging (SLR), and radio tracking. These satellites will be equipped with light emitting diodes (LEDs) for optical tracking while the satellite is in Earth shadow. It will be possible to compare the orbits determined from different methods to examine the systematic and random errors associated with each method. Furthermore, if each LEDsat has a different flash pattern, then it will be possible to distinguish closely spaced satellites shortly after deployment. The Sapienza University of Rome 3U CubeSat URSA MAIOR with LEDs and retro-reflectors was launched in June 2017 and is working on orbit. Sapienza has designed a 1U CubeSat follow-on mission dedicated to LED tracking, which was selected for possible launch in 2018 in the European Space Agency's (ESA) 'Fly Your Satellite' program. The University of Michigan is designing a 3U version with LEDs, GPS receiver, SLR, and radio tracking. The Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) is leading a Canadian effort for a LEDsat mission as well. All three organizations have a program of testing LEDs for space use to predict the effects of the LEO space environment.\n\nCURIE: Cubesat Radio Interferometry Experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSundkvist, D.

C.; Pulupa, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe CUbesat Radio Interferometry Experiment (CURIE) is a proposed two-element radio interferometer, based on proven and developed digital radio receivers and designed to fit within a Cubesat platform. CURIE will launch as a 6U Cubesat and then separate into two 3U Cubesats once in orbit. CURIE measures radio waves from 0.1-19MHz, which must be measured from space, as those frequencies fall below the cutoff imposed by Earth's ionosphere. The principal science objective for CURIE is to use radio interferometry to study radio burst emissions from solar eruptive events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere, providing observations important for our understanding of the heliospheric space weather environment. The influence of space weather can be felt at Earth and other planets, as radiation levels increase and lead to auroral activity and geomagnetic effects. CURIE will be able to determine the location and size of radio burst source regions and then to track their movement outward from the Sun. In addition to the primary objective CURIE will measure the gradients of the local ionospheric density and electron temperature on the spatial scale of a few kilometers, as well as create an improved map of the radio sky at these unexplored frequencies. A space based radio interferometry observatory has long been envisioned, in orbit around the Earth or the Moon, or on the far side of the Moon. Beyond its important science objectives, CURIE will prove that the concept of a dedicated space-based interferometer can be realized by using relatively cheap Cubesats. CURIE will therefore not only provide new important science results but also serve as a pathfinder in the development of new space-based radio observation techniques for helio- and astro-physics.\n\nInterplanetary CubeSat for Technology Demonstration at Mars Artist Concept\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2015-06-12\n\nNASA's two MarCO CubeSats will be flying past Mars in September 2016 just as NASA's next Mars lander, InSight, is descending through the Martian atmosphere and landing on the surface. MarCO, for Mars Cube One, will provide an experimental communications relay to inform Earth quickly about the landing. This illustration depicts a moment during the lander's descent when it is transmitting data in the UHF radio band, and the twin MarCO craft are receiving those transmissions while simultaneously relaying the data to Earth in a different radio band. Each of the MarCO twins carries two solar panels for power, and both UHF-band and X-band radio antennas. As a technology demonstration, MarCO could lead to other \"bring-your-own-relay\" mission designs and also to use of miniature spacecraft for a wide diversity of interplanetary missions. MarCO is the first interplanetary use of CubeSat technologies for small spacecraft. CubeSats are a class of spacecraft based on a standardized small size and modular use of off-the-shelf technologies to streamline development. Many have been made by university students, and dozens have been launched into Earth orbit using extra payload mass available on launches of larger spacecraft. The two briefcase-size MarCO CubeSats will ride along with InSight on an Atlas V launch vehicle lifting off in March 2016 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. MarCO is a technology demonstration aspect of the InSight mission and not needed for that mission's success. InSight, an acronym for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, will investigate the deep interior of Mars to advance understanding of how rocky planets, including Earth, formed and evolved. After launch, the MarCO twins and InSight will be navigated separately to Mars.

MarCO is the first interplanetary mission using CubeSat technologies for small spacecraft. The briefcase-size MarCO twins will ride along on an Atlas V launch vehicle lifting off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, with NASA's next Mars lander, InSight. The mock-up in the photo is in a configuration to show the deployed position of components that correspond to MarCO's two solar panels and two antennas. During launch, those components will be stowed for a total vehicle size of about 14.4 inches (36.6 centimeters) by 9.5 inches (24.3 centimeters) by 4.6 inches (11.8 centimeters). After launch, the two MarCO CubeSats and InSight will be navigated separately to Mars. The MarCO twins will fly past the planet in September 2016 just as InSight is descending through the atmosphere and landing on the surface. MarCO is a technology demonstration mission to relay communications from InSight to Earth during InSight's descent and landing. InSight communications during that critical period will also be recorded by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for delayed transmission to Earth. InSight -- an acronym for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport -- will study the interior of Mars to improve understanding of the processes that formed and shaped rocky planets, including Earth.

The NENs future mission set includes and will continue to include CubeSat missions. The first NEN supported CubeSat mission will be the Cubesat Proximity Operations Demonstration (CPOD) launching into low earth orbit (LEO) in early 2017. The majority of the CubeSat missions destined to fly on EM-1, launching in late 2018, many in a lunar orbit, will communicate with ground based stations via X-band and will utilize the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed IRIS radio. The NEN recognizes the important role CubeSats are beginning to play in carrying out NASAs mission and is therefore investigating the modifications needed to provide IRIS radio compatibility. With modification, the NEN could potentially expand support to the EM-1 lunar CubeSats. The NEN could begin providing significant coverage to lunar CubeSat missions utilizing three to four of the NENs mid-latitude sites. This coverage would supplement coverage provided by the JPL Deep Space Network (DSN). The NEN, with smaller apertures than DSN, provides the benefit of a larger beamwidth that could be beneficial in the event of uncertain ephemeris data. In order to realize these benefits the NEN would need to upgrade stations targeted based on coverage ability and current configurationease of upgrade, to ensure compatibility with the IRIS radio.In addition, the NEN is working with CubeSat radio developers to ensure NEN compatibility with alternative CubeSat radios for Lunar and L1/L2 CubeSats. The NEN has provided NEN compatibility requirements to several radio developers who are developing radios that offer lower cost and, in some cases, more capabilities with fewer constraints.

Pioneering work using Defense Meteorological Support Program (DMSP) sensors has been followed by new work using the more capable Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Beginning in 2014, we have been investigating the ability of small visible light cameras on CubeSats to contribute to nighttime Earth science studies via point-and-stare imaging. This paper summarizes our recent research using a common suite of simple visible cameras on several AeroCube satellites to carry out nighttime observations of urban areas and natural gas flares, nighttime weather (including lighting), and fishing fleet lights. Example results include: urban image examples, the utility of color imagery, urban lighting change detection, and multi-frame sequences imaging nighttime weather and large ocean areas with extensive fishing vessel lights. Our results show the potential for CubeSat sensors to improve monitoring of urban growth, light pollution, energy usage, the urban-wildland interface, the improvement of electrical power grids in developing countries, light-induced fisheries, and oil industry flare activity. In addition to orbital results, the nighttime imaging capabilities of new CubeSat sensors scheduled for launch in October 2017 are discussed.\n\nLunar and Lagrangian Point L1 L2 CubeSat Communication and Navigation Considerations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchaire, Scott; Wong, Yen F.; Altunc, Serhat; Bussey, George; Shelton, Marta; Folta, Dave; Gramling, Cheryl; Celeste, Peter; Anderson, Mile; Perrotto, Trish;\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCubeSats have grown in sophistication to the point that relatively low-cost mission solutions could be undertaken for planetary exploration.

However, as instruments become more complex and CubeSats travel deeper into space, data communication rates become an issue. To solve this challenge, JPL has initiated a research and technology development effort to design a 0.5 meter Ka-band parabolic deployable antenna (KaPDA) which would stow in 1.5U (10 x 10 x 15 cu cm) and provide 42dB of gain (50% efficiency). A folding rib architecture and dual reflector Cassegrainian design was selected as it best balances RF gain and stowed size. The design implements an innovative telescoping waveguide and gas powered deployment. RF simulations show that after losses, the antenna would have over 42 dB gain, supported by preliminary test results. KaPDA would create opportunities for a host of new CubeSat missions by allowing high data rate communication which would enable using high fidelity instruments or venturing further into deep space, including potential interplanetary missions. Additionally KaPDA would provide a solution for other small antenna needs and the opportunity to obtain Earth science data. This paper discusses the design challenges encountered, the architecture of the solution, and the antennas expected performance capabilities.\n\nInSight Atlas V MARCO Cubesats Installation\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2018-03-17\n\nAt Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, twin communications-relay CubeSats, called Mars Cube One (MarCO) are installed on an Atlas V rocket.
